            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>he <hi>Engliſh</hi> flouriſhed under the mild Government of their native Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:57207:4"/>
and all that was raiſed for the publick uſe deſcended in fruitful ſhowres on the place that exhaled it, or (which is the worſt that can be objected) if only to the advantage of ſome particulars, it was yet by ſuch a mediation diſperſed at laſt amongſt the reſt of the people and returned to its firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors.</p>
            <p>But if we be neceſsitated to grant the people of <hi>England</hi> (generally ſpeaking) to have been more too blame than the <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans,</hi> we are aſſured it will be allowed us to raiſe the fidelitie of our Gentry above that of theirs (though very commendable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable) who having no ſuch averſion for the Commonaltie adhered not to their King in order to its ſuppreſsion, but out of a ſenſe of their own duty, which was ſo prevalent that many eminent Perſons and Families which might have been accepted by the overcoming party with great advantages, perſiſted to a voluntary ſinking with their King and Maſter, after having acted ſo highly and honourably, and ſuffered ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in his Service, as might have made them ſeem excuſable, if they had at laſt taken ſome care of themſelves, of which were the Hiſtorie extant (whoſe want is one
<pb facs="tcp:57207:4"/>
of our great misfortunes) as well for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing the memory of very many tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Actions, as giving Examples and Cautions to Poſteritie, it would paſs for no leſs Romantick to other Nations than this of <hi>Naples</hi> does to ſome of ours, how juſtly I know not, for to queſtion the truth of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, written by a Perſon of ſuch Quality is very uncivil, and he had been as injurious to his diſcretion as honour, ſhould he have given any other than a true account of what paſſed before the eyes of ſo many malicious witneſſes that could and would have evinced the falſitie.</p>
            <p>This granted, the Objection of being Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick ſeems to its advantage, for as ſuch Romances are moſt acceptable that are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated to the Probabilitie of Hiſtorie, ſo ſuch Hiſtories are moſt conſiderable whoſe truths are ſo eminent that they riſe neer the fables of Romances: but if it be meant of the manner of his Style and freedom of his Expreſsions, I think we ought to excuſe him if they were ſuitable to his actions, and if as <hi>Ben. Johnſon</hi> ſays of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For the Pretence of forming a Republick
<pb facs="tcp:57207:5"/>
he ſeems nothing ſerious in it, but to have held it out as a Lure both to Nobilitie and People, and indeed he could not but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand (what the Duke of <hi>Andria</hi> told him at the Conference) how little the natures of the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> ſuited with it, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever goes about to raiſe ſuch a Structure without this conſideration will fail of his end, and we may remember how often the like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt came ſhort to the Innovators of our own Nation; for when Rebellion had effaced the intire form of our ancient Monarchie, and layed white Paper before them to deſign their Republick, they could never give it any ſhape, and this appearing ſo difficult in the model, how much more would it have proved ſo when it ſhould have been put in practice in the vaſt extent of three potent Nations (as he ſaid of the <hi>Neapolitans</hi>) born for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
            <p>And if we conſider the few changes from Monarchy that have been transferred to our Knowledge, as of the <hi>Romans</hi> of old, and the <hi>Switzers</hi> and Low-countrey men of late, we ſhall find a temper moſt ſuitable, their moderation, induſtrie, frugalitie, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie which are not the virtues of our Nation in theſe times) ſo regulating private
<pb facs="tcp:57207:5"/>
manners that a ſlack rein in the publick Government was ſufficient, whileſt on the contrarie, where faction, pride, hypocriſie, ſloth and luxurie predominate even Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths have recourſe to the power of a ſingle perſon, as the <hi>Romans</hi> to Dictators in particular diſorders and difficulties, and thoſe arriving at greater heights to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Government of Emperors, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſucceſsions of vicious Princes could not interrupt, till the monſtrous and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralelled exceſſes of <hi>Nero</hi> not eaſily put an end to the Family of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> the changes that happened afterwards are not to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, mention here being made only of Hereditary Monarchy.</p>
            <p>This was alſo moſt remarkable in the Republick of <hi>Florence,</hi> obliged on account of perpetual factions and tumults to give an abſolute and arbitrary power to one of its private Citizens, by which it obtained that Repoſe and Settlement, it could by no other ways arrive at. And that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are no leſs than the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> incapable of an eſtabliſhment on a popular baſis is apparent enough, all endeavours having been uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and all ſuch forms of Government produced, yet it was found by experience
<pb facs="tcp:57207:6"/>
that even the tyranny of <hi>Oliver,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the injuſtice, bloud, hypocriſie and atheiſme on which its foundations were laid, was leſs offenſive than any of the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the hands of one alone; our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being ſo far from a capacity of receiving the other impreſsion, that it may be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally concluded that had we lived in form of a Republick as many ages as we have done under Monarchy, the preſent condition of our affairs and cuſtoms would oblige us to caſt our ſelves into the arms and protection of a ſingle perſon; for evil manners produce not only good laws but good forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we ought therefore to ſuſpect all that hang out this bait, and aſſure our ſelves it is not the Government but Governours they deſign againſt, ſince all architects of popular fabricks, after acquiſition of ſufficient cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit for it, have been eaſily perſwaded to take the Authoritie into their own hands.</p>
            <p>And now let us take a ſhort review of the whole, and we ſhall ſee a people groaning, not under pretended but real oppreſsion, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhake off a yoke, heavie indeed, but yet their Maſters, and erect a <hi>Babel</hi> of their own contrivance, and having conſidered the plunderings, devaſtations and maſſacres
<pb facs="tcp:57207:6"/>
that attended the acting towards it, paſs through its ſo many appearances of Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and at laſt (when probably ſo near perfection, by the Dukes as firm Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in the hearts of that people, as ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain a foundation was capable of) ſee it by Divine Providence reduced to where it firſt began, and then I doubt not but we ſhall be ſo far from ſeeking pretences of Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we ſhould neglect real occaſions were they offered us, and rather ſuffer the extremeſt violences of a legal power (from which yet we are ſecured not onely by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of our preſent Sovereign, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the hereditarie Juſtice and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Family) than by attempting alterations expoſe our ſelves and Poſterities to eternal confuſion and diſorder, in which the beſt that can be hoped will be to return to where we first ſet out, after having given ſufficient cauſe to have all the burthens, creatures formerly of our imaginations, laid really on our ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>I conclude with conſideration of the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> condition after their redaction to the obedience of their Master, when hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier Chains were impoſed upon them to prevent the like extravagancies, whereas
<pb facs="tcp:57207:7"/>
we, by indulgence of the moſt gracious Prince of the World, are treated with the wonted clemency, his Goodneſs having obliged him to omit making ſuch proviſions againſt the like diſorders for the future, by firmlier eſtabliſhing and ſtronglier guarding his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as (if we become not ſhortly wiſer) will appear to be wanting both to King and People: In the mean time let all ſuch as on pretence of freedom incroach upon the Roial Power contain themſelves and underſtand, that the Prerogative (unlimited by corrupt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHARACTER OF THE DUKE OF GUISE. By a Perſon of Quality.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Preſent Poſterity the <hi>Encomium</hi> of a Prince of vertue equal to his Birth, and though it may ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>em ſuperfluous in a Preface to a Book, that will it ſelf ſufficiently publiſh his Merit, cannot omit this teſtimony, ſo juſtly due to his memorie, that never any man received greater endowments from Heaven, nor better manifeſted them to the World.</p>
            <p>I will not in it be guided by Maximes of Rhetorick but duty, and my Pen ſhall leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Conceptions of my Brain than the inclinations of my Heart. I have too many
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57207:8"/>
things to ſay in praiſe of this Prince to ſay them well. And ſince it is not my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here to diſplay mine own Abilities, but to make him appear ſuch as he really was, I ſhall be ſatisfied in the Picture becauſe very like. I will ſay nothing to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his name, all Hiſtorie abounds with the fame of thoſe that have born it, and confining my ſelf to his Perſon, acquaint ſuch as do not alreadie know it, that <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Loraine</hi> Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was handſome without pride, curious without affectation, affable without neglect of his qualitie, valiant without tranſport, and liberal without profuſion. His Civilitie was equal to his Courage, both which emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently appeared in a Duel, where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his adverſarie might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven pretence for an excuſe had he been capable of ſeeking one. He hurt and was hurt, but concluded it with immortal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>All the Nobility of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> have with Aſtoniſhment ſeen him (in a manner alone) reſiſt, and with his ſword in his hand pierce through whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever oppoſed. Hiſtorie vaunts the Actions of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> for ones ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming croſs an arm of the Sea, though in a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57207:8"/>
manner covered with the darts of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the others paſsing the River <hi>Granicus,</hi> and attaquing an Army drawn up in <hi>Battalia</hi> on the other ſide. Both theſe ſeem to me equalized in the paſſage of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to <hi>Naples.</hi> He braved the Sea and the Winds, and in a Feluque, with onely three in his Companie, contemned a fleet of enemies to ſuccour his Friends.</p>
            <p>As his Valour was infinite ſo was his Goodneſs. None ever went diſsatisfied from his preſence, he, as well as <hi>Titus,</hi> was the Favorite of Mankind: His natural Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs obliged him to ſympathize with others in their misfortunes. His modeſt Mirth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired it ſelf into all his Companie. The diverſions where addreſs, Gallantrie and Magnificence uſually ſignalize themſelves, ſeem all faint and languiſhing now he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no more. And though we have a Maſter moſt eminent in all, yet when from his incomparable Perſon we deſcend to his Court, we quickly miſs its principal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>None could ever blame him unleſs for exceſs in that which to be without is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a vice. He loved (they will ſay) with too much Paſsion. If Inſenſibility be a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57207:9"/>
blemiſh to the beauty of a mind, why ſhould not tenderneſs augment its value and luſter. With an unequall'd Zeal he embraced the intereſts of thoſe that depended on him. His Credit, his Sword, his Eſtate were ever at the devotion of his Friends. But above all he lov'd the King with a reſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſsion. In his ſickneſs he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed me in this which I had before obſerved on ſeveral occaſions, and the unhappy Concluſion of it manifeſted to me how much our great King was concerned. For it was to me he diſcovered thoſe glorious marks of his ſorrow, when he heard of his death, becauſe he knew how highly I honoured him in his life.</p>
            <p>What reſts there yet due to his memory? He was reconciled to God and lamented by his King, deplored by his friends, adored by his ſervants, extolled even by thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied him, and admired by all. He hath left behind him a Succeſſor worthy of him. And to compleat his felicity we cannot but be confident that although his glory was moſt eminent amongſt men, it is yet incomparably more ſo in Heaven.</p>

            <head>MEMOIRES OF HENRY D. of Guiſe. Book I.</head>
            <p>AN unfortunate accident, which, do what I could to the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came but too publique in <hi>Europe</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me to ask leave of the Queen Mother, who then governed, to make a journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> by it to free my ſelf from the inconveniencies lay on me as prejudicial to my reputation as to the Eſtabliſhment of my Fortune, and the Zeal I ever had to render the Crown all manner of Services, as I am engaged by Honor, Birth, and particular Inclination, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to a Continuance there a year or more.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth expreſſing great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me, I thought I ought to manage it, ſo as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57207:10"/>
to make my ſelf (if poſſible) the Inſtrument of his Reconciliation with <hi>France,</hi> though ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of my own weakneſs in order to ſo great a work. And knowing that Cardinal <hi>Mazzarin</hi> did with paſſion deſire a Cardinals Hat for his Brother, then Archbiſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> being firmly engaged in his intereſts, having promiſed him my friendſhip, and devoted him my Services, I did with all imaginable induſtry endeavour to find out for what reaſons his Holineſs was ſo little inclined to it, and after a long diſcourſe with him one day about the preſent condition of the affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> inſenſibly engaged him to diſcover the occaſion that obliged him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a diviſion ſo prejudicial to all Chriſtendom, and which it lay in his power to end with much facilitie, for I was certain that if he would make the firſt ſtep towards it, he ſhould find the Court intirely diſpoſed to a good underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Immediately he aſſured me of his love to the <hi>French Nation,</hi> which he would ever juſtifie to ſuch as pretended any favour from him; but that he had too many cauſes of Complaint againſt Cardinal <hi>Mazzarin</hi> ever to forget them. He particulariſed all his grievances, That his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was diſapproved, That the Kings Miniſters in <hi>Rome</hi> on all occaſions forgot their reſpect to him, threatening and affronting him in his Perſon and Familie; and in this diſcourſe he was ſo farr tranſported, that I thought it beſt to let him cool before I returned any anſwer. He ſeemed ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at my ſilence, telling me he perceived I found his Complaints ſo juſt that I wanted a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57207:10"/>
I walked with him the length of the Gallerie twice, without making any, and when (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting my ſilence to his advantage) he preſſed me to ſpeak, I ſmiled and told him, That I wanted not Reaſons to oppoſe his, but that as yet I found him not in a condition to reliſh them, though they were ſo powerful, that I was aſſured they would convince him, and oblige him to grant all I ſhould demand, and do abſolutely all I ſhould deſire, though at the preſent he were of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion: He aſſured me nothing could be able to alter him, that his Reſolution was too well grounded: I ſmiled again, telling him I durſt ſwear the contrary. To this he briskly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, he could not imagine from whence I ſhould derive ſuch a hope. From the conſideration, ſaid I, of your Prudence, which on a ſerious reflection will oblige you to caſt off all Prejudice, and diſcern your true intereſt and the conduct you are to obſerve, which you will infallibly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, becauſe you ought to do ſo, and would too much injure your ſelf ſhould you ſtray from it. In order to this I begged of him to hear me pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently without interruption, becauſe intending not to exaſperate or diſpleaſe him, I ſhould retire as ſoon as I found him moved, and deferre my diſcourſe to another time; which yet ſhould not be till he ſent for me, reſolved to give me a favourable audience, and credit what I ſhould ſay, which he ought not to ſuſpect, I acting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Commiſſion moved onely by my Zeal for his re-union with <hi>France,</hi> in free acknowledgement of the Kindneſs he had for me, and (if it might
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57207:11"/>
be permitted me to ſay ſo) out of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I had for his Perſon. He yielded to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions I demanded, promiſed a confidence in me, and to hear me patiently, and thanking me for my affection to him, with an embrace told me; what he ſhould refuſe me, he would not grant to any perſon in the World: that he ſhould be glad I could find Reaſons to perſwade him, and that, if his Reconciliation ſhould ever be made, it might be by my interpoſal, that the honour and advantage of it might be mine.</p>
            <p>I gave him account in few words of the affairs of <hi>France,</hi> and poſture of the Court, letting him diſcern the impoſſibility of ſeparating the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of the Nation from thoſe of its chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: that ſince he had not at preſent any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>France,</hi> he could not hope to make any there by diſobliging it. That though, having the Diſpenſation of Graces, all men depended on and had recourſe to him, yet with all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Papacy he could oblige no body there, unleſs by the Courts concurrence: that the difference being no point of Religion, none would ſide with him. The Devout and Zealous (though inclined to it) wanting pretence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ingage the peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e in his quarrel. That Perſons of Quality would as Neuters be indifferent Spectators of what might happen, and condemn him for refuſing a Hat, which could not be ſo important to him, that on its occaſion he ſhould reject the friendſhip of a Crown. That obſtinacy ill becomes a Father, that this Quality obliges to greater Moderation, and that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57207:11"/>
all Chriſtendom would blame him for drawing on (by a capricious refuſal) the unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences for which he ſhould be reſponſible, and lament when it would be too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. That the ſame cenſure would fall on Cardinal <hi>Mazzarin,</hi> ſhould he ſtand off, after ſo obliging an offer; That he ought to give an example to all Chriſtians of ſuppreſſing Paſſion; and that if he would believe me in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I would engage, that all he could demand ſhould be granted him, being aſſured that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Mazzarin</hi> deſired nothing more than to enter into his good opinion, and fix a ſteady friendſhip with him; that his Election ſhould be no more mentioned but with acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and approbations, that he ſhould be treated with all Honour and Compliance, that all Diſcourſes diſ-reſpective or menacing ſhould be diſavowed, that ſo preſſing and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Orders ſhould be ſent to ſuch as ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate with him, for giving him all that belongs to him, that for the future he ſhould have as great cauſe of Content as he formerly thought he had of Complaint.</p>
            <p>He ſeemed very much calmed and in a manner convinced; and embracing, told me, I had very much ſatisfied him; That if I had been ſooner at <hi>Rome,</hi> I might have prevented the heats and differences paſſed, that he would ſeriouſly reflect on our Diſcourſe, which he deſired me another time to proſecute, and that the firſt day of his leiſure he would ſend for me to that purpoſe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me withal ſome light that would not be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57207:12"/>
uſeleſs to my conduct. That in the mean time he was ſorry for the trouble I muſt ſuffer by the endeavours of the Cardinals of the Faction, and the Kings Miniſters, to diſcover the ſubject of our interviews: that I ſhould be careful not to truſt them much, that he was aſſured the greateſt part of them were againſt an Accommodation, that they might continue neceſſary and make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the diviſion.</p>
            <p>The ſame things were treated on in two or three other Conferences, and I every time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with ſomething more of hope, ſtill obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Popes averſion to ſlacken, and receiving anſwers more favourable. At laſt being ſent for one day, finding him in a very good humour, after he had expreſſed a great deal of Affection and Kindneſs for me, and that he had no greater ſatisfaction than in my Company, which he would enjoy oftener, and ſend for me at all times when his Affairs permitted, did he not apprehend my prejudice by it, and that his friendſhip might prove contrary to my intereſt, the great aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Cardinal <hi>Mazzarin</hi> for him conſidered. I replied, it was in his power to put an end to that averſion, repeating all the Reaſons I formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced; theſe he now found more valid, and ſeemed convinced: The Diſcourſe held with him by Cardinal <hi>Grimald,</hi> the manner of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations of the Marquis <hi>de Fontenay,</hi> and of the Abbot of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Nicholas</hi> touched him very ſenſibly, and were indeed inſupportable. They giving out (as he ſaid) that he was ſo great a diſſembler that none ought or could depend on his word,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57207:12"/>
and this he expreſſed with ſo much Paſſion that rage drove tears from his eyes: at which yet I was not much concerned, Knowing well enough he could ſhed them at his pleaſure, and was an excellent Actor. However I perſwaded my ſelf I gained upon him, and confidently told him, that having diſcovered where he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacquable, I had brought about my deſign, and that he muſt yield, having no more defences againſt me; then I asked him, if his predominate Paſſion were not revenge, as is uſual with all <hi>Italians?</hi> and whether he would not thank me if I ruined at Court ſuch as he was diſ-ſatisfied with, making their conduct to be diſapproved, and them to paſs for malicious or undiſcerning perſons; and in fine cauſe them to looſe their employments, which ſhould be beſtowed on ſuch as were more agreeable to him? He caſt his Arms about my neck, promiſing if I could effect this, there ſhould be nothing in the World he would refuſe to do for my ſake. You muſt then, ſaid I, make the Archbiſhop of <hi>Aix</hi> Cardinal, with aſſurance, that you had done it ſooner but for the ill conduct of thoſe you had to deal with, that you will oblige all the <hi>Mazzarin</hi> Family, and enter into a near friendſhip with it: that you deſire not to treat any more with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that have hitherto been intruſted in the Kings affairs, whom you have diſcovered to be little affected to his Service, and then demand they may be put into the hands of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> when he ſhall be Cardinal, who being your Creature will have a particular care to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57207:13"/>
his brother in a good underſtanding with you. That Cardinal <hi>Grimaldi,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Fontenay,</hi> and the Abbot of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending to become uſeleſs, and conſequently little conſiderable, have always embroiled mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as ſoon as they imagined this buſineſs near Concluſion. Give me order to make theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances in your name, and continue to treat with them as if your mind were ſtill unaltered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing the Cardinals Hat when they appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident you intend never to give it, by this means you will credit me, ruine their reputation and deprive them of all truſt, by diſcovering to the Cardinal, they have not a true friendſhip for him, that they ſacrifice him to their particular inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, and deal not franckly, but miſ-report your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to profit themſelves by the miſ-intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. He walked twice the length of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery ruminating on what I had ſaid, and looking pleaſingly on me, told me I had touched him in the part that was moſt ſenſible, that I obliged him in the higheſt, and that unable to denie me any thing, he conſented to the Hat for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> that I ſhould give notice of it to his brother, and write to him to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> that I ſhould inſert all the particulars of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and give ſome part of them to Cardinal <hi>Grimaldi,</hi> the Marquiſs of <hi>Fontenay,</hi> and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who would think me ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly weak in crediting his fair Promiſes for want of Knowledge of him, he in the mean time ſtill expreſſing himſelf to them after the old manner, by which means they would yet engage
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57207:13"/>
themſelves further by giving intelligence that he promiſed what he never intended to perform, and that I ſuffered my ſelf to be abuſed by his flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; that this would infallibly bring about their ruine.</p>
            <p>What he and I foreſaw failed not to happen. I diſpatched an expreſs to Cardinal <hi>Mazzarin,</hi> to acquaint him what paſſed, but he gave little credit to it, the Miniſters making it appear ſo doubtful; and after the acknowledgements of his Obligations to me for concerning my ſelf ſo far in the intereſts of his familie, he adviſed me to diſtruſt the Popes proceedings, to obſerve him nearer, and not credit lightly, leſt at laſt I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the diſpleaſure of a diſappointment. That for his Brothers journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> he could by no means approve it, ſince it would be too diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for him to go thither, and return not made a Cardinal. The Lord <hi>Peter Mazzarin</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt with former impreſſions could never be perſwaded of this good news, but the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Aix</hi> (as men are eaſie to believe what they deſire) received my Letter with much content, and the vivacitie of his temper not permitting much reflection, entertained great hopes, and ſuffering himſelf to be transported with joy, prayed me to aſſure the Pope of his acknowledgements, that he would very ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt himſelf at his feet, and in his brothers name ratifie all particulars of our agreements for which himſelf would be the ſecurity, and after the reception of ſuch a favour, procure from <hi>France</hi> whatever could be deſired on his behalf. In the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57207:14"/>
mean time I ſought to make ſure of the Ladie <hi>Olympia,</hi> in which I found little difficultie, being well with her, and ſhe already gained by the money of the Earl of <hi>Ognate,</hi> ambitious to be a Cardinal, who doubtful of a nomination from <hi>Spain,</hi> ſaw no readier way to his end than this occaſion. He opened himſelf to me, and we joyned our forces to make a ſtronger battery, preſſing on the buſineſs at one and the ſame time with united forces; Cardinal <hi>Paucirolle</hi> was the only perſon likely to thwart us, but the other undertook the bringing him about.</p>
            <p>And knowing him a profeſt enemy to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Mazzarin,</hi> I thought the mediation of Cardinal <hi>Sforza,</hi> my Coſin and particular friend neceſſary: He was deſirous to engage himſelf in the intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> from which he expected a treatment ſuitable to his Birth and Merit, and to obtain conſiderable Penſions and Benefices; but Cardinal <hi>Grimaldi</hi> probably oppoſed him, with all his power, apprehending he might ſtep into his place, to the loſs of a conſiderable part of his credit. I undertook to reconcile him with the <hi>Mazzarin</hi> Family, to which he had ever been contrary: And he on his part contrived a meeting between me and Candinal <hi>Pancirolle:</hi> Now as in <hi>Rome</hi> all enmity gives way to the ambition of obtaining the Papacy, upon the aſſurance I gave him of removing the Excluſion he feared from <hi>France,</hi> which alone might be deſtructive to his pretence (being already ſecure of <hi>Spain</hi> and a ſtrong party in the Conclave) he promiſed in stead of oppoſing to ſecond me: this removed all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57207:14"/>
by the great Aſcendent he had over his Holineſs inclinations. This negotiation was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with ſo much diligence and ſecrecie that it was not diſcerned by the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, who continuing obſtinate in their opinions diſpatched to court advices of very little certainty.</p>
            <p>Having brought things to this paſs, I viſited Father <hi>Serroni</hi> a friend of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> and now Biſhop of <hi>Mandes,</hi> to oblige him to go to the Archbiſhop and haſten his coming. I writ alſo to Cardinal <hi>Mazzarin</hi> to ſend him, making my ſelf reſponſible for the ſucceſs of his journey, to which yet he would not conſent, not truſting theſe fair appearances, nor the Popes humour, which he took to be cloſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful.</p>
            <p>There needed not many perſwaſions to move the Archbiſhop of <hi>Aix</hi> to the journey, in this particular not being ſwayed by his brothers Council, ſo vehemently deſirous of what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that for it he would have run all hazards: He ſet on therefore immediately, and giving me notice by poſt, I inſtantly gave account of it to his Holineſs, well perceiving the joy it gave him: At the Archbiſhops coming near <hi>Rome</hi> the Pope commanded me to meet him, and before he ſpoke with any of the Kings Miniſters, aſſure him of his Promotion, and that without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſuch diſcourſes as might be made him, he ſhould credit me alone, who would be reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for all I had pretended, which at his firſt audience ſhould be confirmed; and that he had had his ſatisfaction long ſince, if I had been ſooner
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57207:15"/>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> or if none but my ſelf had interpoſed in his buſineſs, being the beſt and faithfulleſt of his friends. After his thanks he conjured me to preſs the compleating of what I had ſo well begun, which I neglected not. But whileſt I continued my ſollicitations, there intervened a difficulty by a poſt from <hi>Spain,</hi> bringing news that the Catholique King approved not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Count <hi>Ognate,</hi> who deſired of the Pope ſome little time to endeavour by mediation of friends to remove the obſtacle, to which the Pope conſented. And ſome apprehending that the Pope himſelf was craftily the occaſion of this, ſo to diſ-engage himſelf of his promiſe to me without imputation, I propoſed to him as an expedient, that he ſhould go on, reſerving the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in <hi>Petto,</hi> whom he might afterwards nominate at his leiſure, when this d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fficulty ſhould be removed, and they at <hi>Madrid</hi> had made choice of a more agreeable ſubject: But he continued reſolute to ſend an expreſs, that he might give no pretence for Complaint of Precipitation. After much conteſtation I was forced to ſubmit, yet with aſſurance from him that he would by no means fail of performing what he had promiſed me, and that in ſix weeks (what anſwer ſoever he received, or in caſe they maliciouſly detained his Expreſs) he would give me ſatisfaction. There was a neceſſity of ſo long patience, and the time being expired the Archbiſhop deſired me to challenge the promiſe, I did it, and his Holineſs ſo poſitively confirmed me that I found no grounds for further doubt;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57207:15"/>
But yet deferring the Conſiſtorie from time to time, the party concerned falling into a greater diſtruſt, told me he could not be eaſed of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his Holineſs would poſitively appoint the day he ſhould receive the advantage he ſo much coveted: I went and deſired this favour of him as neceſſary to my repoſe and credit, he made many difficulties, the like having never been practiſed. But repreſenting to him that if he had the kindneſs for me he pretended, he ſhould teſtifie it in paſſing by, for my ſake, the ordinary formalities. He promiſed me, and performed it in the moſt obliging manner, with which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently acquainted the Archbiſhop, who received the news with all the joy imaginable. The next morning, which was Saturday, the Pope ſent one of the Secretaries of his Chamber to acquaint the Archbiſhop that on Monday without farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay ſhould be a Conſiſtory. They that deſired not this, as being engaged to maintain that the Archbiſhop as well as my ſelf was deluded, and that the Pope would find ſome new pretence for delay, were ſenſibly moved, and on Monday ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, when they heard the Conſiſtory was aſſembled, and the Archbiſhop had received the Hat. His Holineſs immediately ſent me the good news, as principally concerned, for which in the afternoon I went to give him thanks: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to Complement the new Cardinal, who gave me a thouſand embraces, proteſting that his whole Family as well as his Brother and himſelf had ſo ſenſible an obligation to me, that I might depend on whatever was in their power,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57207:16"/>
of which I ſhould ſee effectual proofs on all occaſions, and for which he would be my Security all his life.</p>
            <p>That night he went <hi>incognito,</hi> to give his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs thanks, who told him he owed his Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me alone, wiſhing him to go and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, and withal adviſed that it might never be forgotten by himſelf or brother. In order to which he haſted to me, tranſported to admiration, which yet will not ſeem extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to ſuch as underſtand what it is in <hi>Rome</hi> (unleſs in the Families of Popes or Soveraign Princes) to ſee two Cardinals of one Family. I am not able to repeat the terms of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, nor what he ſaid to demonſtrate how farre he held himſelf obliged, for having (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the opinion of all the world,) obtained for him that, which the power of <hi>France</hi> and credit of his brother had failed in, and of which he had deſpaired. At his taking leave I proffered to wait on him to his Coach, which he conjured me not to do, deſiring to avoid all ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, becauſe <hi>incognito</hi>; but perceiving me follow, he ſet himſelf on a run, and not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a well that was in a little Garden through which he paſſed, having turned towards me to take his leave, as he retreated he fell into it, from whence I helped him out, not able to forbear laughing: He went home to dry himſelf, and to bed, where (though he wanted reſt) I believe he ſlept not, leſt at his waking he ſhould impute his good fortune to the illuſions of a dream.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57207:16"/>The ſame night he ſent an expreſs to acquaint his brother Cardinal <hi>Mazzarin</hi> with his good ſucceſs, and taking upon him to make known the obligation he had to me, and my conduct in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting an enterpriſe of ſo much difficultie, I thought it beſt to leave all to him, this being more becoming than to be my own trumpet, and ſo contented my ſelf to ſend onely a Letter of Complement and Congratulation. The anſwers we received were ſuch as might be expected in return of ſo welcom a Meſſage.</p>
            <p>The Pope became very well ſatisfied with the Orders that were ſent relating to his particular, and the Miniſters began to negotiate with him in a manner ſo reſpective and obliging, that he well perceived all former reſentments were forgotten, and that the <hi>Mazzarin</hi> Family was moſt ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted to his intereſts, which the two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would ever ſollicite. He made alſo very obliging acknowledgements to me, and I had ſome reaſon to believe, that what pretences or occaſions ſoever intervened, I might depend on the Protection and ſupport of <hi>France,</hi> as well as on the Perſon of his Holineſs. The Kings Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters alone looſing as well at <hi>Rome</hi> as at Court a great part of their credit and truſt, nettled to the quick, that even in their ſight, and againſt their ſenſe, ſo important a negotiation had been brought to effect, conceived an irreconcileable hatred againſt me, ſo much the more dangerous, in that (not daring to give it vent) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it in order to an opportunity of making me feel its fatal effects, decrying all the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57207:17"/>
Services I afterwards rendered the Crown, which they blemiſhed what they poſſibly could, and not contented with their vain attempts againſt my reputation, at laſt deprived me of my Liberty by a long and hard impriſonment, and as much as was poſſible for them brought my life into danger, that they might not apprehend in me an irreprochable witneſs, of their having been too much led by their paſſions and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, and to them ſacrificed the glory and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Cardinal <hi>Mazzarin</hi> and his Family.</p>
            <p>In this very inſtant I met an occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what fruit I was to expect of ſo much pains and hopes (ſo juſtly grounded) to have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Cardinal <hi>Mazzarin,</hi> the good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Sollicitation of the late Biſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> now Cardinal of Saint <hi>Cecilia,</hi> and the Popes favour, by the ſurpriſing news which came to <hi>Rome</hi> of the tumults in <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and revolt of <hi>Naples</hi>; where <hi>Maſaniello</hi> was head. I will not enlarge my ſelf to the particulars of a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſo fatal to <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo extraordinarie; All <hi>Europe</hi> hath been ſufficiently informed, and I reſolved in theſe relations to ſpeak of no more than I am my ſelf concerned in, leſt I ſhould be obliged to too great a Volume, not pretending to the Hiſtorian, which would be as troubleſome, as unſuitable to my humor and qualitie: In theſe Diſorders I ſuppoſed I might find fair Opportunities of acquiring glory, and contributing to the advantages of <hi>France,</hi> which hath ever been my prevailing Paſſion, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ambitious and zealous (as I ought) for that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57207:17"/>
Crown to which I have the honor to be born a Subject, perſwaded I could no ways better employ my life than for the good of my Country, and prejudice of its enemies. Being one Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning retired with the Baron of <hi>Modene,</hi> in whom I had very much confidence, and who was at that time Gentleman of my Chamber, I diſcovered my thoughts to him, ordering him to ſeek out Captain <hi>Peronne,</hi> brother of <hi>Dominico Perronne</hi> the famous Bandite, and chief of the Confidents of <hi>Maſaniello,</hi> whom he brought to me in the Morning; Him I deſired to find out his brother, and perſwade him that in ſtead of the Cruelties he exerciſed in <hi>Naples,</hi> burning the houſes, and goods of Monopoliſts, demanding Exemption from Cuſtoms and Impoſts, he ſhould rather think of ruining the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> naturally vindicative, and under whom the revolters would never find ſecurity or pardon, that he ought therefore to ſeek the ſuccour and protection of ſome power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Stranger; That there was not any in the World ſo confidently to be depended on as <hi>France,</hi> who ever gloried in aſſiſting the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed that had recourſe to her, without any other intereſt than the reputation acquired by ſo generous actions. That the <hi>Catalonians</hi> were faithful witneſſes of this, as well as a great part of the Princes of <hi>Germanie.</hi> That he could not doubt of her power by Land and Sea, which made her redoubted and reſpected through the World. That I would undertake to negotiate in behalf of the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> all Supplies and Aſſiſtances they ſhould deſire, and for effecting this, would
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57207:18"/>
render my ſelf into their hands an Hoſtage. Beſides I would labour reuniting the Nobility with the people, (without which all attempts that could be made for Libertie would prove vain) ſo depriving their Enemie of all poſſibility of continuing in that Kingdom, his principal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port conſiſting in the Nobility; That my name and the Family of which I deſcended would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much to ſo great a deſign, I engaging my ſelf in the intereſts of the whole Kingdom as intirely as if I were a Native.</p>
            <p>He went away (ſatisfied and won by my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) chearfully to undertake this important Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, as well affected as inſtructed for what he was to do. But as misfortune would have it, his brother being ſlain, at his arrival he was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and conſequently impriſoned: nothing diſcour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe unlucky beginnings in ſtead of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, animated me to an enterpriſe that appeared more glorious in the proſpect of ſo many perils and difficulties. The arrival at <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Don Pepe Caraffa,</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Metalone,</hi> with ſome other Gentlemen that had made their eſcape from the Caſtles of <hi>Naples</hi> where they had been long detained Priſoners with great rigour and ill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ge, gave me hopes of making uſe of their reſentments, for effecting that with the Nobility (whom I know to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57207:18"/>
by continual grievances) which ſo many accidents had hindered me from bringing about with the people: My endeavours proved not ſucceſsleſs, and having intirely gained him, he reſolved to hazzard his return, there to ſpeak with his brother, and the reſt of his friends and kindred, and oblige them to embrace the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſerving me, and revenging themſelves. But the peoples averſion for the Nobility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing by artifices of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he became an unhappy victime as well to it as to the hatred of Cardinal <hi>Filomarini:</hi> Soon after his arrival, having perceived his hopes and mine fruſtrated, he was maſſacred with unheard-of cruelties, his body torn and dragged through all the Streets: <hi>Maſaniello</hi> having been treated in the ſame manner. After this I ſent a young Captain, Grand-Child of <hi>Cicio Arpaia,</hi> the peoples Elect, to treat with him, who was abſolute Maſter, and of greateſt credit in the Citie. This unhappy Meſſenger met the ſame fortune with the former, falling into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whoſe diſtruſt augmenting by diſcerning my perſiſtance in endeavouring by all ways to concern my ſelf in their diſorders, kept ſo ſtrict a guard on the Paſſages, that a <hi>French</hi> man ſervant to <hi>Monſieur Deſſinay</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Avignon,</hi> who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to me during my ſtay at <hi>Rome,</hi> a Youth witty and reſolute, (whom I ſent by Land, under pretence of liſting himſelf in their ſervice as a <hi>Bourgundian,</hi> to give me account of thoſe I had diſpatch'd formerly, of whoſe ſad fates I was yet ignorant) was taken near <hi>Gaeta,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57207:19"/>
whither he was brought, though after a cunning diſcharging himſelf of his Papers, from whence (having ſuffered the torture ordinary and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary) he was releaſed, with Command on pain of death to avoid that Kingdom: Finding by his return that none of thoſe I formerly ſent had ſucceſs, I thought my ſelf obliged to try For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune again; and (two young reſolute <hi>Italians,</hi> whom I gained with Money, proffering to run the Extremeſt hazards for me) ſhe yielded to my importunity, and began to be leſs contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicio</hi> of <hi>Arpaia</hi> received my Propoſals with much content, imparted them to his friends and heads of the people, who hoped <hi>Naples</hi> ſhould recover her deſired Liberty, by the aſſurance of aſſiſtance from <hi>France,</hi> I rendering my ſelf their hoſtage, and they in my perſon obtaining a Leader, to whoſe birth and name all would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit without jealouſie: which was no leſs than neceſſary, the Nobility of the Countrey being ſo vain and haughty, that every one of them, (eſteeming himſelf worthy the Command) would refuſe to obey any of their own Nation, or yield him advantages above the reſt. A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity appearing to take off the reſpect (which through the higheſt of the Sedition) was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> I conceived the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt way to engage them to reject his yoke, and advance to a diſtance might render them irreconcileable, was The Propoſal of forming themſelves into a Republique, which muſt needs prove an agreeab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Lure: the Nobility by it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the principal ſhare in the Government,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57207:19"/>
after the Example of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to exclude them in imitation of the <hi>Switzers.</hi> So both parties flattering themſelves with hopes of obtaining their deſires, would joyntly endeavour the Extirpation of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> after which it would be eaſie to change the Government without giving any jealouſie of <hi>France,</hi> which I repreſented to them as obliged to their aſſiſtance, onely, by its intereſt of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them from <hi>Spain,</hi> as it had done formerly for the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who had at laſt obtained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and independence.</p>
            <p>And to teſtifie the zeal I had to ſacrifice my ſelf, and hazard all for their ſervice, that I would pretend nothing from them, but the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for my ſelf and Succeſſors that was granted to the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> in the United Provinces, which they have continued hitherto with ſo much ſplendor and honor.</p>
            <p>The Title of Republique (of which I was the firſt Propoſer) dazeled their eyes immediately, and from that day was the onely Diſcourſe of <hi>Naples:</hi> My proffers were received with open arms, and they ſent me word, that though all things ſeemed calm at preſent, ere long they ſhould again take arms, the Conditions granted by the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> being ſo diſadvantageous to <hi>Spain,</hi> that they could not be ratified by its Councils, wherefore the reſentments of that vindicative Nation were to be expected at the firſt arrival of its forces; The Vice-roys faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in yielding to all demands, proceeding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from want of power to juſtifie a refuſal;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57207:20"/>
that I was therefore beſought in the name of all the people to negotiate for them the protection of <hi>France,</hi> and its ſuccors when time ſhould ſerve, and to be my ſelf in a readineſs to come and take the command of their forces, upon the firſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, which muſt needs happen very ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then I ſhould be ſought to by Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſent expreſs. I was over-joyed at ſo handſome an opportunity of ſerving the King, and becoming by the effects of my own induſtry and addreſs able to propound to him ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous a deſign, which I alone was in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to undertake and execute. I diſpatched therefore an expreſs to Court, with Letters for the King, Queen Regent, the late Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Mazzarin:</hi> and encharging my late brother the Knight of <hi>Malta</hi> with what he was to negotiate on my behalf, I ſent him this following Inſtruction.</p>

                     <p>FIrſt, he is to repreſent, that happening to be here at the time of the revolt of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> I ſuppoſed it to concern the Kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to gain a partie there, which having
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57207:20"/>
made known to the Ambaſſadour, and more particularly to the Cardinal of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cicilia,</hi> they not onely teſtified their approbation, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gave me aſsurance, that in the ſervice I endeavoured to render <hi>France</hi> I ſhould be aſsiſted by its Credit and Forces, in caſe I could negotiate any thing conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that having been ſo happy as to make ſuch a party as might aſſure me of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I could not neglect giving notice of it, that I might receive Orders what to do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and know if I might be allowed ſuch aſsiſtance as ſhould be neceſſary for executing the enterpriſe.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, that however the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of affairs were ſuch, that ſeveral men, (and I perhaps more than any other) might be flattered with hopes of a ſettlement to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as advantageous as ſolid, I was not capable of that thought, nor ever to entertain any like it, whileſt the King ſhould with reaſon pretend ſo juſt a conqueſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that finding the people of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> abſolutely reſolved to free themſelves from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tyranny, and (after the Example of <hi>Holland</hi>) enjoy the Libertie they ſhould acquire, I believed <hi>France</hi> would Conſent, that ſeeing a poſsibility of ſuch place as is poſſeſsed by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57207:21"/>
in the United Provinces, I might endeavour to obtain it; becauſe, beſides the advantage <hi>France</hi> would receive by depriving its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of this famous Kingdom, peradventure my addreſs and diligence might acquire me ſuch eſteem amongſt the people, that I might prevail with them (if weary of their own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) to ſubmit themſelves to our Crown, under which I might in ſuch caſe juſtly pretend to be Viceroy.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, that I have the more reaſon to hope ſuch a conſent in regard the attempt is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hazardous, that onely my ſelf dare venture on it, becauſe whoſoever does ſo, muſt caſt himſelf into the hands of thoſe people, without other aſſurance than their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, without any Forces of his own, or Places of ſtrength, and without being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the landing any Strangers, till they conceive them needful and demand them: The confidence I have that my Perſon will not be diſagreeable to the Chiefs of them, does the more eaſily engage me, beſides the hopes that the Protection of <hi>France,</hi> and friendſhip of the Cardinal will not ſuffer me to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: and that when I have been ſome time there I ſhall have acquired credit to make me afterwards ſubſiſt ſecurely.</p>
                     <p>He ſhall adde that the heads of the people
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57207:21"/>
having ſent me an expreſs to invite me to this reſolution, I do very ſhortly expect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with power to agree on conditions, they being reſolved at the time that the ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what was granted them by the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy ſhould arrive from <hi>Spain,</hi> in caſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of their Articles, to take offence and make uſe of that pretence for a ſecond ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and attempting Liberty: and in caſe of condeſcention not to be ſatisfied, but ſeek ſome other cauſe of Complaint, though of the former there is little appearance, it not being to be credited that Caſtle <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Elm</hi> ſhall be put into their hands, as the Governour hath gon about to perſwade them. And if the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this people for me, whom they know not, ſeem ſtrange, he ſhall reply it is acquired by ſome friends I have amongſt them, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually do me good Offices on account of the care I have had here to careſs and win all of that Nation, beſides the diſtruſt of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent General <hi>Don Franciſco Toralte,</hi> and all the Nobility. There remains no more but to deſire him to be very careful to obtain for me (that which is moſt abſolutely neceſſary) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion to accept the imployment offered, an Order, (in caſe I ſhall need it, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my paſſage) to ſome Ships or Gallies to accompany me, and aſsiſtance of money, as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57207:22"/>
on mine own particular I will raiſe all I poſsibly can; and, I conjure him to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat the Cardinal for paying my Penſions, and ſome other Summs due from the Crown, and to aſſure him, that as ſoon as the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger I expect ſhall arrive, I will with all diligence diſpatch an expreſs, to give him a particular account of the Propoſals.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57207:22"/>I formerly communicated to the Kings Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters all particulars, that they might write confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably: And, whether it were, that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled their thoughts, or really eſteemed me ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of renewing the troubles which ſeemed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed in <hi>Naples,</hi> they approved the reſolution I had taken, incouraged and preſſed me to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; with aſſurance, that I ought not to doubt of all neceſcary ſupplies, ſince I undertook the greateſt Service could poſſibly be render'd <hi>France,</hi> by making ſo powerful a diverſion du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her War with <hi>Spain</hi>; of which, ſhe would well know how to make uſe, and find her advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in the prejudices of her Enemy, whom ſhe muſt needs over-power with her Forces, when he ſhould be depriv'd of thoſe he drew from ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent a Kingdom, which ſupply'd him with more Men, Money, Ships and Gallies, than all his other Dominions; that therefore, nothing was to be omitted, in order to diſpoſſeſs him of that Crown, and that it little imported by what meanes. That I was looked on as very fit for the enterpriſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, that without conſideration of danger, would ſacrifice and hazard all for Glory; that, in like manner, time would be gained to the Court for taking its meaſures, which would venture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but my Perſon, whoſe loſs would be little conſiderable. But, in caſe I eſcaped, and could embroile Affairs, any Conditions might be made, the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> being once engaged, and become irreconcileable: and afterwards, making uſe of my Labour and Induſtry, it might at leiſure be reſolved, to ſuffer me to perfect this Conqueſt,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57207:23"/>
or Retire; to eſtabliſh, or ruine me, either of which would be ſtill in their power.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal of St. <hi>Cecilia,</hi> the onely perſon I could depend on, well knowing that the reſt of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> were my Enemies, on account of the ſervice I had done him, by which they loſt part of their truſt and credit, undertook to ſend to his Brother the Memorial hereafter inſerted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied only by a word or two, referring the reſt to what ſhould be diſcerned by its peruſal.</p>
            <p>But before I go further, I hold it very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to reconcile an appearing contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my Inſtruction and Diſcourſe, and to clear my ſelf from the greateſt imputation hath been laid to me, that I ſollicited nothing but Money; as if I thought my ſelf capable of ſtanding on my own bottom, and ſought no other aſſiſtance, out of an affectation of independence. The firſt is eaſily anſwer'd; When I demanded permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Court to undertake this Enterpriſe, if I had let it appear, that I had no other cabal in <hi>Naples,</hi> but what I my ſelf had gained; and, that in ſtead of their having ſent for me, it was I that offer'd my ſelf to go, I ſhould have been look'd on as Chimerical, and no reſolution would have followed, in a time, when all <hi>Italy</hi> thought the Diſorders quieted, my ſelf alone, by ſecret correſpondences, being aſſured the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: Beſides, that choice might have been made of ſome other to head this Enterpriſe, (with which I moſt earneſtly deſir'd to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, it being as full of danger as glory) had they not thought it unavoidable to leave

me the Conduct: So that it was both more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and more to the purpoſe, to make the Anſwers I received paſs as Propoſals, and the perſons I employed as deputed from that People; for which I ought not to be blamed, it being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten neceſſary to uſe addreſs and diſſimulation towards thoſe we deſire to ſerve, to engage them, when we apprehend their irreſolution: beſides, that propoſing nothing but the hazard of mine own Perſon, without reflection on the Kings Authority, I aſſured my ſelf my proffer would not be rejected, which would give me op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Acting without conſtraint, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiating without obſtacle, and gain me the eſteem of the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> ſeeing me in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to ſerve them, by the Kings conſent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: and, that conſequently to me would be directed Commiſſions for what ever was to be treated with them, which might no longer paſs through other hands; neither could they have thoughts of employing any other in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I by this meanes having all at my diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal: This, being well conſider'd, will paſs for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs no wayes blameable.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond Objection: It is yet eaſier to demonſtrate the Reaſons that obliged me to the conduct I follow'd, and make appear, that I was decried without ground, and that my Enemies maliciouſly endeavoured to make uſe of it, that I might be abandoned, and reſponſible for the ill ſucceſs of an enterpriſe, in which I have ſo comported my ſelf, that my actions being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively examin'd, and my memorials peruſed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57207:24"/>
without preejudice, it muſt needs be granted, that humanly ſpeaking, more than I did, could not have been done; and, that it was never known before, that one Man alone, could, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſtoniſhment, ſo long ſupport the burthen of Affairs ſo embroiled, reſiſt the whole power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that of the United Nobility of a great Kingdom, &amp; redreſs ſo many Diſorders without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſupplies; thoſe I juſtly expected being not only refuſed, but vaunted, and made appear onely in order to diſhonour, and ruine me; and had no other effects but to deſtroy that for which I had laboured, retard all that my addreſs and diligence had ſet forward, and manag'd to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and to encourage my Enemies and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, by all wayes, to attempt againſt my life.</p>
            <p>It is certainly admirable, and without example in Hiſtory, that, in the midſt of Aſſaſſinations, and Tumults, without any in whom I could put confidence (not excepting my own Domeſtiques, who, for the moſt part, ſerved me not according to my intentions; nor thoſe, that had engaged themſelves to follow my Fortune, who failed of their duty; and, as little the Miniſters of a great Kingdom, for whoſe Service I Acted, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the moſt to my ruine; or the Court, whoſe Orders were detained from me, and which was prepoſſeſſed by reports as malicious as falſe: Or a People Vain, Cruel, and Seditious, I made War without Powder, Ammunition, or Money, with new-raiſed and ill-armed Forces, without Canon or Baggage: and yet cauſed a City to ſubſiſt five compleat Moneths, the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57207:24"/>
of which were fortified, and in the hands of the Enemy, Block'd by Sea with a powerful Fleet, and Beleaguer'd by Land with an Army ſtrong, both in Horſe and Foot, Proviſions cut off on every ſide, all Elements contrary, continually batter'd by three Caſtles; notwithſtanding all which I maintained a famiſhed People in Reſpect and Obedience, put an end to their Diſorders, Murthers, and Plunderings, re-eſtabliſhed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Juſtice, and at laſt repoſe and tranquillity, in a place, where, before my arrival, innocent blood inceſſantly flowed about the Streets; Violence was Authorized, Burning and Pillaging Houſes not only tollerated, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, with ſuch fatal and Tragical events as could not be beheld without compaſſion, horror and aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>Did not conſideration of the ſafety of many heads that are dear to me, oblige me to ſuppreſs the greateſt part of my moſt ſecret negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I could diſcover That would convince my Enemies, and thoſe that envy me, and make me appear to the eyes of all Europe, not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent but glorious, in having by Miracle as new as ſurpriſing, raiſed force out of weakneſs; and perſecuted by all the World, and deſtitute of all aſſiſtance, my ſelf alone brought ſo difficult an enterpriſe to ſuch perfection, that the Conqueſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>: and conſequently the deſtruction of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, (of which it is the moſt ſolid foundation) failed, on no other account, but that I was envied the glory of it, and could never obtain ſo much as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57207:25"/>
for taking in the leaſt fortified place; which, might I have had, it would have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to have compleated ſo extraordinary and glorious a worke, which I undertook without any other intereſt than to injoy the honour of it, after which I could have died joyfully, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that through all Poſterity my memory ſhould be glorious. But, my ambition giving place to my friendſhip, I will not, to defend my ſelf, bring them into the leaſt danger, and reſolve (by publiſhing nothing, but what I may declare without their hazard) to ſuffer my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to be condemn'd by ſuch as (never weighing the labor and conduct, made uſe of) Judge of things by their ſucceſs, and have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſteem nor contempt for any, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their good or evil Fortune. I hope I may be eaſily pardoned this digreſſion, which I could not poſſibly omit, and on which perhaps the diſpleaſure to ſee my ſelf blamed without cauſe, hath too long detained, and tranſported me to too great heat and reſentment.</p>
            <p>To returne then to that which I promiſed to make underſtood, I muſt ſay, that having at that time no other favour to pretend, but leave to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the offer was made me, to Negotiate with the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> and devote my ſelf to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſacrifice my ſelf to their intereſts, and recovery of their Liberty, I demanded nothing but Money, becauſe it was then the only thing neceſſary to render me conſiderable amongſt them, and put me in a condition to be uſeful to their aſſiſtance: Beſides, that they had informed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57207:25"/>
me, that they wanted only a Head to eſtabliſh Order amongſt them, that they might advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly make uſe of all thoſe things, which (to invite me) they pretended they had in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance; that they apprehended all Forrain Powers, and that I ſhould have given them diſtruſt, in providing my ſelf of that which they demanded not of me, and that if I had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to go to them, without Forces that ſhould not have depended on their Authority, or the ſupport of a powerful Army, I ſhould probably have given them jealouſie, that under pretence of defending them, I intended to ſubdue them to <hi>France,</hi> That it was neceſſary to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of their Armes before any farther Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, having to do with irreſolute People, engage them to advance ſome ſteps before they themſelves perceiv'd it: That, having a forme of Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> it was they that muſt renew the War; That it would have ſeemed, that <hi>France</hi> had ſollicited them to a new Inſurrection, which I perceiving muſt infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow, thought it was beſt to ſtay for it, that neceſſity and apprehenſion of ruine opening their eyes, might force them to have recourſe to the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protection that could be preſent and uſeful to them, that ſo upon their applications, the King might have opportunity of making ſuch Conditions as he beſt liked; that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they ſhould apply themſelves to me to mediate for them; and that I ſhould have loſt their good opinion, if I had done it of my ſelf
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57207:26"/>
without their inſtruction; and laſtly, that my buſineſs being to ſatisfie a multitude, every particular of which hath a different ſenſe, it is nice and dangerous to make advances, ſuch affaires being often ruin'd by precipitation; that, having patience, I ſhould ſee time inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lead them to the point I deſir'd: which failed not to happen two Moneths after, no more than the preſſures wherewith by their order I ſollicited the arrival of the Fleet, which had ſo little effect, and the ſupplies I in vain pretended, of Men, Victuals, Powder, Artillery and Money; all which ſhall be juſtified hereafter.</p>
            <p>I am yet (that I may rectifie ſome diſorder which appeares as to time) to tell you that it is true, that the Cardinal of <hi>Aix,</hi> who had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Title of Saint <hi>Cecillia</hi> was not a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal when I made my firſt diſpatch: but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, he was ſo within a very ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, long before my embarquing for <hi>Naples,</hi> and his promotion then reſolved on, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to divide the negotiation I had made in what related to him, I thought it a very ſmall fault to give him the quality of Cardinal by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. Having made appear that this was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a miſtake nor default of memory, I returne to my ſtory by the Letter he writ to Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> his Brother, to accompany the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial I put into his hands.</p>

               <head>Memorial.</head>
               <p>THe People of <hi>Naples,</hi> unable any longer to ſuffer the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tyrannies, apprehending ſevere Chaſtiſement for the attempts they have already made towards repoſe and liberty, and, finding no ſecurity in the conditions propoſed to them, are at laſt reſolved intirely to caſt off the yoke, to be enfranchiſed, and become their own Governors in forme of a Republique. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible, that without a head (after the ſame manner as is uſed in <hi>Holland,</hi> from which that Countrey derives ſo great advantages) it is impoſſible for them to maintain themſelves: And having already learned to their coſt, that they cannot chuſe any in their own Countrey ſo unbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſed, as not to be liable to corruption, or that (the natural jealouſie of the Nation conſider'd,) ſhall not acquire as many enemies as emulators, have reſolved to chuſe a ſtranger to run their fortune with them, who can expect no ſecurity amongſt them, but in the fidelity of his Services. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being accidentally at <hi>Rome,</hi> hath ſeemed to the chiefeſt and moſt intelligent, a Perſon very proper to render them ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Service; and that the rather, in regard his birth exempts him from the emulation ſeveral of that Nation might have for another: that none will make difficulty of obeying him; nor can any ſuſpect a perſon of his quality capable
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57207:27"/>
of corruption or weakneſs, to this purpoſe the Duke hath been ſent to with notice, that they would give him more particular information by an Expreſs, which he daily expects, charged with ſufficient power and inſtructions to treat, and make conditions, but (reſolved not to engage himſelf in ſo great a deſign, though uſeful to the intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> without the Kings Permiſſion) he offers, in caſe his Majeſty approve it, to run the hazard of this buſineſs, and ſacrificing himſelf for performance of ſo eminent a ſervice, to employ his life for the advantages of the Crown, of which (in caſe of Conſent) he alſo hopes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and to be aſſiſted with whatever he ſhall ſtand in need, but above all with a quick diſpatch, which is abſolutely neceſſary; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Naples</hi> deſiring to make an attempt with their utmoſt force the next moneth, which is the time the ratification of the Articles agreed on with the Viceroy is to arrive from <hi>Spain,</hi> or they to become ſenſible of its refuſal. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> moſt humbly deſires that all may be kept very ſecret, to prevent the ruine of ſuch, whoſe friendſhip and eſteem for him is all their crime.</p>
               <p>After theſe diligences, whileſt I expected the Courts anſwers, I thought fit to drive the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on farther with what ſtrength I could, and to this purpoſe ſent to <hi>Don Franciſco Trealte</hi> General of the Arms of the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> to diſcover whether his imployment would not claſh againſt my Pretences, and whether he would not make difficulties of obeying me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was reſolved to go through with the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57207:28"/>
and whether he had not ſome ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>? He received favorably the perſon I ſent to him, promiſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy in the Negotiation, which he faithfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and returned, that he ſaw little aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the vain and impetuous humour of the people he ſerved, that (their diſunion from the Nobility conſidered) little good could be done, without an expedient to put an end to it. But if a French fleet might appear in a condition to land Forces and Supplies of all things neceſſary to furniſh the Town with Victuals and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he thought the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might eaſily be driven away, the great averſion of the whole Kingdom as well Nobility as People, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral wearineſs of their Government conſidered. That if I came to head this enterpriſe he would very willingly receive my Orders, underſtanding what was due to my name and family, for which he ever had much reſpect; That there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to be treated on with him, I was onely to make ſure of Supplies, and cauſe the fleet to appear: but above all to have a care of dealing with <hi>Signior Octavio Marquis,</hi> who was a Perſon timerous and irreſolute, and that concerning himſelf in their affairs, kept ſtill a ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Viceroy.</p>
               <p>Neither did I omit to hold particular Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with all the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> that were in <hi>Rome,</hi> careſſing them what I poſſibly could, to the end that although they proved not uſeful to my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, they might at leaſt by ſpeaking well of me to their Countrey-men, by their Letters, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57207:28"/>
reports of thoſe that went home, make me known and acquire me Friends and Credit. I employed part of the night to give audience, to all that demanded it, to bring me news, and thought not the time loſt when after the harken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to twenty impertinents, I met one from whom I gained any light. <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay</hi> was importuned with many fabulous relations, and intelligences brought him every moment; There arrived not a Marriner, that to get a reward, did not give him ſome account of the diſorders, and ſome fained to be come expreſs that had never been out of <hi>Rome.</hi> And they often brought him, what had been ſpoken in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Popes with-drawing roome, at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew de la val,</hi> and the <hi>Minerve</hi>; and ſome that knew nothing but what had paſſed through twenty ſeveral mouths, writ Letters, and dated them at <hi>Naples,</hi> to get the credit of perſons well informed, and that had great Correſpondencies, though their moſt important ſecrets were drawn from Vulgar report. His humor naturally neither free nor obliging, people ordinarily went ill ſatisfied from him, to give me account of all they had told him; ſo that amongſt many triffles I ſometimes learned things he vainly ſought to conceal from me, and I took great care to pleaſe and humor every body, that I might be informed of all, and gain the general inclination of the <hi>Neapolitans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt this great number of intelligencers there was at <hi>Rome</hi> one <hi>Lorenzo Tonti,</hi> of mean Birth, but quick wit, who by many intrigues ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57207:29"/>
made himſelf agreeable to the Earl of <hi>Monterei,</hi> and finding the way to live by this induſtry, forſaking his handicraft trade, gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence for Money, and receiving often recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, began to live at his eaſe on what he had ſpared; but his Patron being out of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and returned to <hi>Spain,</hi> he choſe to reſide at <hi>Rome</hi> as a ſecure and pleaſant retreat, being a place where with a very moderate expence one may live honorably. He had applyed himſelf to follow Prince <hi>Ludoviſio</hi> the Popes Nephew, where he practiſed the Artifices and Subtleties he had learned in <hi>Naples,</hi> and attained the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the School of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; by his means his brother in law <hi>Augustino Lieto,</hi> a young man witty and of an active and turbulent humour, had obtained a Company, in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Calabria,</hi> which gave him the title of Captain.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Perſons muſt not be forgotten, each of them having acted a conſiderable part; the firſt with all Induſtry endeavouring wayes of making himſelf conſiderable, and ſome innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to occaſion them, became one of thoſe diſperſers of news, that write to all manner of people to procure anſwers, which ſometimes they make themſelves, and read in all Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, after having digeſted them into Order, and by this means are welcome to the Miniſters of Princes, and ſuch others as are Curious, of whom they obtain Gratifications. He ſpent his idle hours at <hi>Rippa,</hi> where the <hi>Feluccaes</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and all others from Sea come
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57207:29"/>
a ſhore where he made much of the Mariners, and gave them Wine, pumping from them what he could to make his Court to the Marquis of <hi>Fontenai:</hi> And underſtanding that I endeavored to have a ſhare in thoſe diſorders, he came every night to inform me what he had learned, holding this correſponce with me (as he ſaid without the others Knowledge, finding me very ambitious to do ſomething high and conſiderable for the ſervice of <hi>France,</hi> he imagined he ſhould draw great recompences from me, and ſo by me or <hi>Monſieur de Fontenai</hi> make his fortune.</p>
               <p>He writ very ſolicitouſly to all parts that he might be the better inſtructed, and gain credit with more ground and appearance, and at laſt by his addreſs bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me neceſſarie, to the Agent of the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> to the Ambaſſadour and my ſelf. He gave me hopes of obtaining for me the command of the Army, and I on my part aſſured him of my acknowledgements, and to make his brother in law Captain of my Guards, the more to win thoſe of the Country, by entirely putting my ſelf into their hands, entruſting my Perſon to a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> and taking off the Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my employing <hi>French</hi> men in the moſt conſiderable charges of my Family: this was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for getting footing amongſt them, till authoriſed by my actions, I might afterwards alter it, and take ſuch courſe as I judged moſt honorable and moſt ſafe. I gave not yet ſo great truſt to him, that I neglected o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her correſpondences, or whatever elſe might contribute to the deſign I had propoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:57207:30"/>I diſpatched Captain <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> at his return from whence he made me a report of its condition, either true or fabulous. It is very certain that the little addreſs of thoſe that commanded, their too great confidence ill grounded the incapacitie as well as malice of ſeveral of them in a ſhort time changed the face of affairs, ruined the foundations I had laid, and loſt all hopes of farther advantages to the people by depriving them of thoſe they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in their hands, which having been well managed, nothing could have been more eaſie than to drive away the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> take the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadels of the Town, and generally all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of the Kingdom, without one ſtroke ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or ſhedding one drop of bloud, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unprovided of all things neceſſary to defence. Very evil Council was followed during the Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Arms, to ſupply all places with Victuals, Powder, and other Ammunition; ſuppoſing by it to teſtifie their reſpect to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and oblige him to ratifie the Conditions agreed on with the Viceroy, which were too much to their advantage to be confirmed: this yet they were perſwaded to by ſome of their Chiefs, gained by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they (to their coſt) not in the leaſt ſuſpecting them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> of whom I ſhall often ſpeak, who ever played the Traytor with great addreſs, having maliciouſly, the ſooner to conſume the Corn which remained, ſufficient for four or five Moneths Proviſion, cauſed Bread to be made, weighing fourty five ounces, and ſold for the ſame
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57207:30"/>
price, as that had been which weighed but 25, and alſo waſted the ſtock ordained for ſupplying that which ſhould be drawn from the Publique Granaries, worth a hundred thouſand Crowns, in Liberalities he diſtributed amongſt the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Officers of greateſt Authority, (he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the charge of Commiſſary-General of the Proviſions) in ſuch manner that at my arrival I found but very little, and no money at all to buy more.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Auguſtin</hi> gave me account, that at the laſt Muſter there appeared one hundred and ſeventy thouſand men in Arms, active, reſolute, and ready for all Enterpriſes, how dangerous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and that the five or ſix hundred horſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready raiſed, by making uſe of thoſe that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Coaches, in leſs than eight days might be made up five or ſix thouſand. That reckoning what had been preſerved of the Plunder, Jewels, Plate, and ready Money in the Banks, belonging to Perſons either declared or ſuſpected Enemies, there might eaſily be amaſſed three or four mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Gold: That there was great quantity of Powder, beſides that three hundred workmen daily wrought in making more: That they had Magazins of Match, Bullets and Salt-peter, that they had ſecured all the Copper, and ſuch other Mettal that could be found in the Town for caſting Artillery, beſides fourty Pieces mounted in the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Tower, and at the entrance of all Streets and other avenews, by which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might attempt; That the whole Kingdom was in Arms as well as the City, and beſides Corn

for ſix Moneths Proviſion in the Granaries, they might have from the Countrey, which was of their Partie, what they pleaſed, and in ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance as could never fail them, That the enemy had not Forces ſufficient to block the Paſſages, or hinder its tranſport, That they had no need of Strangers, which would give a jealouſie to the people, who out of apprehenſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſubject to a new Authority, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile themſelves to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſuppoſing, that (in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of obtaining the liberty they pretended, and for which they were ſo well reſolved to die) they ſhould only exchange their Chains for new ones, which perhaps would prove more heavie: That if there ſhould happen any diſcourſe of another forein Dominion, many different Cabals would be formed, which would joyn themſelves with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Nobility, to oppoſe that Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſhould ſeem likely to prevail over the reſt. That they wanted nothing but a head to teach them to fight, and eſtabliſh order amongſt them; That if their Forces and what elſe they had in their hands were well managed, they would ſuffice, not onely to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of that Kingdom, but to make war upon them in their own Countrey, and take from them <hi>Sicilie</hi> and <hi>Sardinia</hi> re-united in the intereſts of <hi>Naples.</hi> That this would be the work but of one Campagna, and the Liberty of the Town but of a few Weeks; That they looked on me as a Perſon capable of actions ſo eminent; and that in fine they ſent not for me to a combat, but to victory and triumph, without toil or peril, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57207:31"/>
to make me the moſt glorious of men, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their Liberty, and freeing them from a ſervitude they had ſo long ſuffered under with ſo much regret and Impatience.</p>
               <p>Knowing the vanity of the Nation I did not give any firm Belief to all thoſe things, yet I could not perſwade my ſelf but there was ſome ground for them, neither could I doubt of the truth of a part, in which yet I was diſabuſed in a very ſhort time; but not till I had ſo farre engaged my ſelf, that I could not with honour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline undergoing the hazard of the enterpriſe. Let all men judge, whether after ſuch hopes, I muſt not neceſſarily be very much ſurpriſed, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the place I found an entire want of all things, and that I had onely my ſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on.</p>
               <p>In the mean time by the return of my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs I received news from Court, and Letters from Cardinal <hi>Mazzarin,</hi> which animated and enflamed me more. He ſaid that ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger appearing in the deſign I propoſed, he durſt not adviſe me to it; but if I reſolved to run the hazard, I had the Kings leave, and ſhould be aſſiſted with all things neceſſary, towards which I had no more to do but apply my ſelf to the Kings Miniſters at <hi>Rome,</hi> and take my meaſures conjoyntly with them, to whom he writ to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I underſtood notwithſtanding that at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of my Expreſs, I was looked on as Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, all advices from all parts importing, that the diſorders of <hi>Naples</hi> were ended; That
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57207:32"/>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> reſolved to ratifie what had been demanded, and conſented to by the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> deferring their revenge and reſentments to a time leſs dangerous, in which they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their ſatisfaction without hazarding any thing; which would be after the concluſion of the Peace, then treated on at <hi>Munſter</hi> with much earneſtneſs. I endeavoured by all manner of ways to underſtand what paſſed and was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of at the Ambaſſadours, and amongſt the Cardinals of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, of which I had moſt exact intelligence, either by Spies, whom I had hired, or by women; and I found that my Perſon gave them greater apprehenſion, than all the Preparatives of <hi>France.</hi> And one day meeting the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> accompanied by four or five Cardinals, I perceived, that (after my ſaluting them) they beheld me very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and their Converſation became more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. That Evening one of the beſt Voices of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom I often went to hear ſing, with whom Cavalier <hi>Lodi</hi> Chamberlain to Cardinal <hi>Montalte</hi> (who had great power over the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Maſter, and knew all his ſecrets) was deſperately in love, having learned of him the particulars of that diſcourſe, for which I had ſo great curioſity, gave me account of it, and told me that that Company diſcourſing of the affairs of <hi>Naples,</hi> (which were the principal ſubject of entertainments in <hi>Rome</hi>) Cardinal <hi>Albornos</hi> ſeeing me paſs by cried out, that if the King their Maſter muſt looſe the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> I alone ſhould do him that miſchief being capable of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57207:32"/>
greateſt undertakings, and qualified to become the head of the revolted, who wanted nothing but a perſon to lead them on to the moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate attempts, and by eſtabliſhing Order amongſt them, let them know their own ſtrength, with the weakneſs of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> To this ſome of the Company having replied, that I was not ſo greatly to be apprehended, minding ſo much my pleaſure, he ſmiled and told them that Duke <hi>Doria</hi> had the ſame opinion of the Earl of <hi>Lavagne,</hi> who the night after made himſelf Maſter of the Town of <hi>Genova,</hi> and had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſo difficult an enterpriſe, had he not been unfortunately drowned in paſſing to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the laſt Galley: that I came not ſhort of him either in Ambition or Courage, that I ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed him in Birth, and deſcended of a Family ever ready to execute the higheſt and moſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous enterprizes; and to conclude, if <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> muſt be loſt, in his opinion, it could not be by means of any other, and added that if they made ſure of me, he would be reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the Conſervation of that Kingdom. That <hi>France</hi> gave him no apprehenſion, but on the contrary he ſhould gladly hear her fleet was under ſail, and arrived in the Haven of <hi>Naples</hi> before that of <hi>Spain</hi>; Its appearance (by reaſon of jealouſie of the <hi>French</hi> power) being the beſt and moſt aſſured way for putting end to the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that kept the people from Reconciliation. This he confirmed with ſo many Reaſons, and ſo refined Politicks that all the Company concurred with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:57207:33"/>This Relation fortified my hopes, and I was confident ſo intelligent a Perſon ſpoke not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, and that my deſign was more eaſie than I imagined it, he having Informations which I came ſhort of. I therefore reſolved to go no more abroad by night, and commanded my Officers carefully to viſit what I was to eat and drink, being in danger of aſſaſſination and poiſon. About this time a <hi>Sicilian</hi> propoſed to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>de Fontenay</hi> a deſign on the Iſle of <hi>Lipari,</hi> extolling the importance of the poſt, and the facility it would give to make advantage of the revolt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> beſides that it would not be unuſeful for encouraging that of <hi>Naples.</hi> He ſent him to me to examine his overture (perhaps repenting to have too lightly engaged with me in the affairs of <hi>Naples,</hi> whoſe execution he thought too eaſie, and therefore rather wiſhed in other hands than mine) imagining I might make an exchange, and apply my ſelf to a preſent attempt, rather than to one which appeared at a greater diſtance. I immediately ſuſpected that this man was ſent to me by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who might flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſame opinion, or that they would inſinuate him into my acquaintance to ſerve them as a Spie, or to be employed on ſome attempt more dangerous. I heard notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that he had to tell me, ſlighting the offers he made, this Iſle being neither well enough for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified nor of ſufficient conſideration, I told him if he had nothing elſe to treat with me, he might cauſe himſelf to be ſuſpected by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and too lightly hazard his life if he came any more to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:57207:33"/>A few days after we had advice of the arrival of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, full of Souldiers, and with them the Perſon of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria.</hi> The people made a deputation to him, and too eaſily believed he brought the Ratification of what had been granted them by the Duke of <hi>Arcos:</hi> and that the King his father ſent him to give greater authority to the Promiſes of preſerving their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and more punctual executing all that had been agreed in his name: But the joy that appeared at his arrival was ſoon over-ſhadowed, when two days after, landing his Forces, the Canon of the Caſtles and whole Fleet diſcharging againſt the Town, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> furiouſly entered, every man with a Sword in one hand and a Torch in the other to confound all in bloud and fire. The conſternation of this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe was very great amongſt the people. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little come to themſelves they all took Arms, and vigorouſly oppoſed their Enemies, who fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be over-power'd by the multitude, were contented to have poſſeſſed all the eminences, and entrenching there, to turn their aſſault to the defenſive.</p>
               <p>By this time the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> perceived, but too late, that they had been betrayed, and ſuffered themſelves to be lulled aſleep, in too great a neglect of the Protection of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours were moſt neceſſary, in ſo preſſing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; they repented that in teſtimony of their Zeal and Fidelity for <hi>Spain,</hi> they had provided the Caſtles with Victuals and Ammunition, which were now employed in a war againſt them, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57207:34"/>
to batter down their houſes. They a hundred times called thoſe men Traytors that hindered the firing of the mine under Caſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Elmo,</hi> which had certainly gained that poſt, which as the ſtrongeſt and higheſt about the Town, did them moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. They were ſenſible of the neceſſity they had of a Head of Birth and Conſideration, (begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to diſtruſt <hi>Dom Franciſco Toralte</hi>) and how uſeful the Protection of <hi>France</hi> would be to them, and the need they had of her Fleet to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt that of <hi>Spain,</hi> which being in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven blocked the Town, and cut off its Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Sea, and conſidering all that was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to their defence, they found very little Corn, leſs Powder, and that they were indeed unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of all things fit for reſiſting their enemies. This deplorable Condition obliged all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Kingdom to declare againſt the City, and the Nobility that had hitherto conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued quiet, leaving it, in obſervance of the Order of <hi>Dom John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and the Viceroy, retired to take Arms, and all Gentlemen as farre as their Credit and Forces would extend, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured at their own charge to make Levies of Horſe and Foot, to form an Army, and come and beſiege them by Land.</p>
               <p>This people, that refuſed ſuccours, and thought they ſtood in need of no man, now begged it of all the World, and publiſhed a Manifeſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the unfortunate Condition to which they were reduced, and ſeeking to move Compaſſion throughout all Chriſtendom, made a lamentable Relation of their adventures, how that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57207:34"/>
their Zeal and Fidelity to the ſervice of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Promiſes had been made, and Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations agreed with them, in contempt of their ſincerity and too great confidence, they had been aſſaulted with unheard of cruelty, their City three days and nights battered by the Canon, to deſtroy it and bury them in its ruines: That they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conjured all Kings, Princes, Potentates and Republiques to take pity on them, by ſending them Supplyes and Aſſiſtances to reſiſt ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Enemies that pretended to be their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and help to free them from ſlavery and oppreſſion. They ſent away to <hi>Rome</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to move the Kings Miniſters to procure them his Protection and Succour, conjuring me to come to them, and moſt earneſtly preſſing the ſending the Fleet, beſought me to become their Solicitor. No day paſſed in which there arrived not ſome Meſſenger from them with new demands; <hi>Tonti</hi> was very much taken up with introducing theſe new Envoyes, and I writ a Letter to the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> to whom, to humour them, I gave the title of <hi>Republique Royal,</hi> which I ſent by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who was detained in his Paſſage by the Gallies of <hi>Genova</hi>; but having happily about him his Commiſſion for Captain in the Regiment of <hi>Calabria,</hi> and ſhewing it to the Duke of <hi>Turſi,</hi> ſo well perſwaded him that he was going to do his duty in that charge, that he ſuffered him to go on his Voyage, and carry news from me which was received with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible joy and applauſe.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Ambaſſadour, Cardinals
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57207:35"/>
of the Faction, and the Kings other Miniſters held a Council (to which I was called) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what was to be done in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, where it was reſolved to ſend an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to Court, to give advice of what paſſed, to preſs earneſtly the equipping and ſending away the Fleet, on which I was to embarque as ſoon as I ſhould hear of its arrival at <hi>Portolongone.</hi> And to make it appear that ſuccours were demanded by the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> themſelves, it was held neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſend into <hi>France</hi> a Carmelite called <hi>Peter de Juliis,</hi> to repreſent their Neceſſities, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore Aſſiſtance and Supplies, he having been ſent us from <hi>Naples</hi> to that purpoſe, they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it would take well to have all this demanded by one of their own Nation. That above all, the ſhipping of a conſiderable body of Infantery was necceſſary, to land, if it ſhould be deſired, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, Money, and ſome Veſſels laden with Corn, that ſo being in a poſture of ſupplying all their wants, Conditions advantageous to the Crown might be negotiated with them.</p>
               <p>All this while there were continual Skirmiſhes in <hi>Naples,</hi> and the people thinking it poor to ſtand onely on the defenſive, deſigned to retake ſome of the Poſts the Enemies had gained from them. The unfortunate <hi>Dom Franciſco Toralte,</hi> Prince of <hi>Maſſe,</hi> thought beſt to begin by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacquing the Cloyſter of S. <hi>Clare,</hi> a place moſt important, as being in a Manner in the middle of the Town. His Wives affection occaſioned his ruine, for detaining him with her the greateſt part of the time, out of apprehenſion of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57207:35"/>
dangers he was to undergo ſhe increaſed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt had formerly of him, he but rarely appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the people, who imputed this retirement, ei- to a neglect of their ſervice, or ſome ill incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and correſpondence; this cauſed murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings againſt his conduct, and deſigns againſt his life, which his preſence might eaſily have diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated. He had cauſed a mine to be made, which failing of the entire effect was expected from it, rendered him reſponſible for the bad ſucceſs, and it was rumored he had cauſed part of the Powder to be taken out and Sand put in its place. The flight of <hi>Octavio Marquies</hi> fortified the ſuſpitions that were againſt him, ſuppoſing it to have been contrived between them. Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to let paſs the firſt furie of the multitude, by concealing himſelf, with hope that afterwards his Juſtifications would be heard more favorably, he was ſo diligently ſought after, that the place of his retreat was at laſt diſcovered, from whence being led and immediately encompaſſed by the rabble, being a comely Perſon and of Quality, Witty and naturally Eloquent, he made them a diſcourſe of his whole Conduct and the Services he had rendered them, in which he was ſo favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably heard, (having many friends, and a general eſteem and affection) that he had in a manner ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured himſelf, and mollified and perſwaded all about him, when <hi>Gennaro</hi> coming in, cried out he was a Traitor, that he ought to be beheaded and his body dragged through the Streets; This being ſeconded by the exclamations of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zares,</hi> who ſought nothing more than ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57207:36"/>
that ſentence (as unjuſt as violent) was immediately put in Execution; They cut off his head, and tore out his heart, which in a Silver Baſon were carried to his Wife, his body being miſerably dragged through the Streets; and by the menaces theſe Raſcals made to burn in their houſes whoever ſhould oppoſe them, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi> was tumultuouſly proclaimed General, in recompenſe of ſo brutiſh and outrageous an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Carmelites</hi> tower (with whoſe guard he had been entruſted ever ſince the beginning of the revolt, becauſe he was Captain of the Trained Band of that Quarter, having his Gun-ſmiths ſhop over-againſt the gate of it) contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much to authoriſe his power, and ſecured him of a Retreat the moſt conſiderable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant of the Town againſt tumults, and ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts as might be made upon his Perſon. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Anthonio Brancacio,</hi> a perſon of years and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and an old enemy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by whom he had been ill uſed without occaſion, was choſen Major-General.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Augustin</hi> found all theſe alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at his return, and addreſſed himſelf to him as well as to <hi>Genaro,</hi> to preſent my Letter, ſhew his Commiſſion, and the Proffers I made of ſuccours from <hi>France</hi>; This old Gentleman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to comply with the brutality and ignorance of <hi>Genaro,</hi> ſo vigorouſly urged my Election, that all the people concurred with incredible joy, and deputed <hi>Niccolo Maria Mannara</hi> (a young man of an active ſpirit, and but lately come into the World) to bring me the peoples diſpatches,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57207:36"/>
companied by <hi>Aniello Falco</hi> (an old Advocate, to whom they had given the charge of General of the Artillery) and ſome others, by whom they alſo ſent Letters to the Marquis of <hi>Fontenay</hi>; Captain <hi>Auguſtin</hi> came back with them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with what had been reſolved.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the Prince of <hi>Maſſa,</hi> but much more of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) to diſsipate the ſuſpitions were had of him, with ſo much Juſtice, drew up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation which the People of <hi>Naples</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Publiſhed, by which, on pain of death, it was forbidden to acknowledge the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or obey his Orders, with Command to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none but thoſe of the Republick, in whom alone the Soveraignty ſhould from that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; and by this diſguiſing his ill intentions, put himſelf in a condition ſecurely to continue his Treaſons, whoſe practice he failed not in to the laſt, though he eſcaped not (after divers years re-eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) the juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ordinarily received by Traitors in ſtead of recompence.</p>
               <p>The Deputies being arrived to offer me the Command of their Forces, I refuſed them Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but wiſhed them to carry their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches to Monſieur <hi>de Fontenay</hi> the Kings Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and that I would not ſpeak with them but when he ſhould be preſent, that ſo I might be the better Authorized, in negotiating only according to the Orders of his Majeſties Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they the more obliged to procure me Supplies, and I the better enabled to negotiate
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57207:37"/>
the Conditions, without which I would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Enterpriſe. As ſoon as he had heard them, and read their Letters, he ſent to deſire the Cardinals of St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Cecillia, Theodoli</hi> and <hi>Veſini,</hi> of the Faction of <hi>France</hi> to come to him, with whom, as alſo with the Abbot of St. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> he held Council, on ſo conſiderable an occaſion. At length ſending the Sieur <hi>Luſarchi</hi> his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to let me know they were with him, and had ſomething of Importance as well to the Kings ſervice, as my Intereſt to communicate to me, I went to know what they had to command me, Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> having acquainted me that I ſhould hear from them His Majeſties Intentions, and that complying with their Opinions, I ſhould regulate my ſelf by their Advice, in a buſineſs of ſo great difficulty. They told me the occaſion of the arrival of the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Deputies, and the eſteem of that Republick for me, making choice of me for their General, and Defender of their Liberty: That it was an Honor (though juſtly due to my Merit and Birth) envied by many Princes; and that beſides the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Services in ſuch an employment I might render <hi>France,</hi> for which they well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood my Zeal and Reſpect, I was in a way to become the moſt glorious Perſon of this Age, by the Actions I was to undertake, by how much the more extraordinary, ſo much the more glorious. I anſwered, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born to no other purpoſe but to employ my Life for the Crown, I was ready to hazard all without conſideration of the Perils into
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57207:37"/>
which I went to precipitate and expoſe my ſelf, though not ignorant of them. That my ruine would be inevitable if abandoned, but that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in the protection of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> in their good Offices and Mediations, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment <hi>France</hi> had to aſſiſt me in a deſign in which I engaged only to manage it to her glory and advantage. Every one of them with emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation aſſured me of all ſuccors neceſſary, The Cardinal of St. <hi>Cecillia</hi> told me, he would ſecure me, I ſhould want nothing: that his Brother and himſelf had too great Obligations to me, ever to prove ingrateful; and, that I ought to put an entire confidence in their friendſhip.</p>
               <p>After this Monſieur <hi>de Fontenay</hi> ſent for the Deputies of <hi>Naples,</hi> who at their entrance ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed themſelves immediately to me; but, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pointed out to them the Cardinals, whom they ought firſt to ſalute, they performed that Duty, and then turning to me, Saluted me on the Knee; refuſing to ſpeak to me otherwiſe: I had much ado to make them ſtand up till I told them I would not hear them in the other poſture. They made me a Speech to repreſent the unjuſt uſage the City of <hi>Naples</hi> received from the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; that againſt a Zeal, Fidelity, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, unſhaken by all the Tyrannies they had continually exerciſed on its inhabitants, they at laſt practiſed the higheſt infidelity, by aſſaulting them, without any new Subject of diſcontent, at a time when they thought themſelves in a well eſtabliſhed Peace, deſtroying the City with Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of all the Artillery of their Ships, Gallies
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57207:38"/>
and Forts, and entring with all their Forces with Torches in their hands, to put all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to the Sword, and burn all the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; that this proceeding ſo injuſt and violent, had ſo far diverted their inclinations, that they were reſolved to break the Chain and acquire Liberty by forming themſelves into a Republick, for the ſecure eſtabliſhment of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, that ſtanding in need of a Head for their defence, and to Command their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the People had appointed them in its Name to come and caſt themſelves at my feet, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure me to become their Protector, and take upon me the ſame Authority in the City of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and the whole Kingdome, as hath been, and ſtill is enjoyed by the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countreys:</hi> That they did not believe they could reaſonably caſt their Eyes on any other; not only in reſpect of my reputation, eſteem, and merit, but out of a juſt reſentment and acknowledgement of the Favors I had done them, and the zeale where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I had engaged my ſelf to ſerve them, and negotiate neceſſary ſupplies; and that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the eſteem <hi>France</hi> had for me, I ſhould be as a Sacred Pledge, to oblige her to their Defence and Protection with all her power: But, that one of the principal Motives of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me for their General, was my Birth, derived from a family that was ſo conſiderable to them, that its Memory was with the greateſt affection imprinted in the hearts of all its inhabitants, as well as its Armes on all Publick Edifices, whoſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57207:38"/>
Foundations were the eternal markes, as well of the Piety as Magnificence of my Predeceſſors. That they believed me too generous to refuſe to ſuccor them, that they had many Armes to reſiſt their enemies, but wanted a Head to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Diſorders, to teach them how to fight, and quickly put them in a condition, not only to defend themſelves, but drive the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> out of their Countrey: That there would be no want of Soldiers when they ſhould be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd, and that I ſhould find none that would not chearfully die under my Command, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſhed his blood to defend his Country, and acquire me honor.</p>
               <p>After this they preſented the Letters they had for me; but, ſtepping back, I told them, That it was to the Ambaſſador and Kings Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters there preſent, to whom they were to apply themſelves, becauſe that I (having the honor to be born his Subject) could not without his permiſſion and command engage my ſelf in a forrain Service, eſpecially in one ſo conſiderable, to which I muſt reſign, not onely the remainder of my life, but alſo my Succeſſors, and that cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing (as it were) to be any longer a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and become a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> ſuch a reſolution was not in my power, owing an abſolute obedience to whatſoever ſhould be ordained me in his name. Monſieur <hi>de Fontenay</hi> then told me, that I ought to accept the Offers made me, ſince the King had not only given me leave, but thought himſelf obliged by it: and that he had Order to tell me. That Sacrificing my ſelf for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57207:39"/>
the Service and Defence of the Common-wealth of <hi>Naples,</hi> I teſtified my zeal and paſſion for his Crown, to which I could not render any ſervice more agreeable, profitable, or important.</p>
               <p>Then turning my ſelf to the Deputies, I told them, That after the permiſſion given me, I joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepted the honor done me by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique, in making choice of me for their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and Protector of their Liberty: That I would keep alive an eternal acknowledgment of a favour ſo extraordinary and little merited. That I would endeavour by my zeal and fidelity to make amends for my incapacity; That I would never forſake them, till I had obtain'd them repoſe and liberty, that I would expoſe my ſelf to all perils, hazarding my life, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the laſt drop of my blood, whenſoever their Intereſt or Honor ſhould be concerned. After this I received their Letters, which I think fit to publiſh here, to make appear, that I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert nothing in theſe Memorials, of which I have not the juſtification ready.</p>

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57207:40"/>After peruſal of theſe, I told them, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Devoted my ſelf to the Service of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Naples,</hi> by the Charge they had offer'd me in its Name, and which (with ſubmiſſion to the Kings good pleaſure) I accepted, with as much ſatisfaction as reſpect and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was but reaſonable they ſhould give me account of the preſent condition of Affaires, and acquaint me with all their neceſsities, that I might begin to demand on their behalves, all ſuch aſsiſtances as they ſtood in need of, and become their ſollicitor as well to the Court as the Kings Miniſters.</p>
               <p>The Deputies told me the Tragical accident of the Gallant, and too unfortunate Prince of <hi>Maſſa,</hi> the Diſorders and Confuſions that reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the City, for want of a Perſon of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Conduct ſufficient to redreſſ them; that the whole Kingdom at the arrival of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> throwing down their Armes, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning their Party, followed that of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; That they received no more ſuccors from abroad, the paſſages being obſtructed on every ſide, and all the Countrey Enemie, except ſome neighbouring Towns and Villages, that ſeemed yet inclinable to them; but the fame of my arrival would alter all: And that they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not but at the appearance of a Chief of birth and reputation, all would take Courage, and wearied by ſo cruel and inſupportable Tyrannies, after their Example uſe all poſsible endeavours towards Liberty: That they were unprovided of Corne for more than ſix weeks or two moneths,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57207:41"/>
with ſmall hopes of any from the Countrey, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by my Valor a paſſage might be open'd to that purpoſe. That although many particular perſons had well profited by Plunder, yet every one concealing his Treaſure, they had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to help themſelves; That the Banke could not be touch'd without raiſing a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sedition, all parties, as well enemies as friends, being concerned in the preſervation of that which had ever been Sacred and Inviolable; that to make uſe of the Churches Plate, was to draw on their heads the Vengeance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and indignation of <hi>Rome:</hi> That the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the reſt of their moſt invenom'd and formidable Enemies, Armed, and got a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back through the whole Realme, that they might contribute to their Oppreſsion, and revenge themſelves for the Affronts and Outrages done to the moſt conſiderable of that Body, by pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their Houſes, and cruelly Maſſacring the Prince of <hi>Maſſa,</hi> Don <hi>Pepe Caraffa,</hi> and ſome others: That they ſtood in need of Powder as well as of wherewithal to make it for want of <hi>Saltpeter</hi> being obliged to conſume a great quantity continually, in Attacques and Defences of the ſeveral Poſtes, and the frequent Skirmiſhes made night and day; That the People, as a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of zeal and fidelity to their King (ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſome corrupted perſons) had, in time of the Truce furniſh'd the Caſtles with Victuals, and Ammunition: That the ſame fault had been committed through the whole Kindom, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Fortreſſes that were before unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57207:41"/>
of all things, hoping, by it, the more eaſily to obtain Ratification of the Articles concluded with the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi>; and ſo, having disfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed themſelves of thoſe things they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had in abundance, they were reduced to the preſent neceſsity, That the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships and Gallies cut them off from the Sea, by which they heretofore received their ſubſiſtance: That they had Multitudes of Men; who, if well Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and Diſciplin'd, being zealous and brave, might undertake great things; That at the laſt Muſter there were found above one hundred and ſeventy thouſand Armed men, well reſolved to die for their Countrey. That, by this Diſcourſe, I could (better than they) judge what was neceſſary for them; and laſtly, that the courage of all the Inhabitants began to fall, and could not be raiſed but by my preſence: That they therefore beſought me to haſten my Voyage all I poſsibly could, and preſs their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, without which they could not evade the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of the Town, and conſequently of the whole Kingdome.</p>
               <p>This true relation cauſed me to make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion on the dangers into which I went about to precipitate my ſelf: But, not valuing my life, and reſolving to ſacrifice it for the intereſts of the Crown, addreſsing my ſelf to the Kings Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, I let them underſtand that I was not at all diſcouraged by news ſo ſurprizing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all that had till then been reported: That it concerned them to conſider, whether the King would engage his Forces in an enterpriſe of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57207:42"/>
ſo much difficulty, that in caſe he would, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to run the hazard; But that they as well as I might foreſee, that to abandon, was to expoſe me to eternal infamy and inevitable ruine; and that it was neither juſt nor reaſonable to engage me too lightly where the reputation of <hi>France</hi> was ſo farre concerned. With one Voice they anſwered, that I ought to doubt nothing; That the Supplies ſhould be ſo ſudden and conſiderable, that in the Execution of ſo glorious a deſign, I ſhould neither meet the difficulties nor dangers I imagined: And going about to convince me of this by many reaſons, I replyed, It was to no purpoſe to alledge them; That I was not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could vainly flatter my ſelf: That I perceived well what was to be feared, but that difficulties and dangers in ſtead of diſcouraging animated me more; that my Confidence in their promiſes, and that which I had in the protection of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Mazzarin,</hi> joyned to my Paſſion (with loſs of my life) to contribute to the advantages of <hi>France,</hi> would make me affront death, and all manner of difficulties; and that I required them to be witneſſes of the fidelity and zeal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I contemned not onely my ſafety, but alſo my honour, when it might be uſeful to ſuch a purpoſe. That they muſt needs concur with me, that I was (peradventure) the onely man in the World capable of undertaking ſo dangerous a Commiſſion, the very apprehenſion whereof might make the moſt hardy and reſolute tremble. They ſeemed convinced of this, and to advance and ſettle ſo great an affair, aſſured me, That I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57207:42"/>
needed onely demand what I deſired, that they had Commiſſion and power to grant it; that on this I might depend, the Kings Promiſes being ſecure and inviolable.</p>
               <p>I demanded the Fleet to wait on my Orders, as ſtrong in Ships and Gallies as poſſible might be; two hundered thouſand Crowns ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in expectation of a larger ſupply; four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot ready to land at my firſt demand; fifteen hundered horſemen with Saddles, Bridles and Piſtols to be mounted at <hi>Naples,</hi> the like furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for two thouſand horſemen I intended to raiſe there; Pikes and Muskets for twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot; twelve Pieces of Canon, 60000 weight of Powder with Match and Bullet proprotionable, and, at the leaſt, four Ships laden with Corn; that, thus provided, I would be reſponſible for the ſucceſs of this great deſign, and for depriving the King of <hi>Spain</hi> of the Crown of <hi>Naples</hi> in a very ſhort time. All of them in the Kings name gave me poſitive aſſurance. Afterwards I gave Letters to <hi>Nicolo Maria Mannara</hi> as did alſo <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay,</hi> that he might render account to the Republique of the happy ſucceſs of his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I charged him alſo to let them know that I prepared for my Voyage to go and ſerve them, and that, as ſoon as the Fleet ſhould be arrived at <hi>Protolongone,</hi> I would embarque without loſs of time, to carry with me all ſupplies that ſhould be neceſſary for them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Tonti,</hi> to let <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay</hi> ſee he had no dependance on me, but on <hi>France</hi> and him alone, hoping ſo either to

credit himſelf the more, or that this miniſter would procure him ſome conſiderable Penſion from the Court, and a ſumme of ready Money for himſelf and friends, with whom he held cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, as he pretended, at a great expence, Or to diſcover, as he endeavoured to perſwade me, whether his pretences to me were ſincere and veritable, propounded to him to move that ſome perſon of quality, as the Earl of <hi>Harcourt,</hi> or Marſhal of <hi>Meilleray,</hi> might come with the Fleet, that ſo it might be in his choice, either to entruſt this enterpriſe to me, or put it into their hands if they ſhould ſeem more agreeable; the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> being in ſo great a neceſſity of ſupplies, that provided they might receive them, they would very little trouble themſelves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider by whom. But, whether it were that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Condition of affairs, he imagined them too hazardous to expect that any but my ſelf would run their fortune; or that he thought me too farre engaged, to ſuffer with patience an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to take my place, being unwilling lightly to offend a perſon of my Condition, He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it would be unreaſonable, after having gone on ſo farre with me, to change thoughts and enter on a different conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tonti</hi> came with great haſt to court me with this anſwer, and to make appear to me as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervice, the artifice he had uſed to diſcover whether they were real in my concernments; After which he deſired me, when I ſhould write to the Court, to recommend the Services of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and brother in law, and procure them Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57207:44"/>
and ſome conſiderable ſumme to reward their Friends and Correſpondents, that they might by intereſt allure many more <hi>Neapolitans</hi> to the ſervice of <hi>France,</hi> acquire Creatures, and form a powerful Cabal, which in time and place might be diſpoſed of to ſerve her faithfully and contribute to her advantages.</p>
               <p>For my own part I had no other thoughts than to fit my ſelf for my departure, and provide all things neceſſary that I might embarque as ſoon as the Kings Fleet ſhould be in a Condition, and place convenient to receive and tranſport me; And knowing I could not undertake this voyage without Money, I uſed all endeavours to get it. I ſent for all the <hi>French</hi> Merchants, to draw from them the greateſt ſummes I could, giving them Security and Bills of Exchange payable at <hi>Paris.</hi> My misfortune would ſo have it, that the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> having taken upon him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Kings armies in <hi>Italy,</hi> and formed great deſigns, and high enterpriſes, wanted it as well as I; in ſo much as that he might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed at the appointed time, the Kings Miniſters had given them order not to part with what they had in their hands: which obliged me to apply my ſelf to the Cardinal of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Cicilia,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Fontenay,</hi> to get them permiſſion to treat with me: who thereupon ſent for the <hi>Sieur Philip Valenti,</hi> and told him he would do the King acceptable ſervice, and a kindneſs to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Mazzarin,</hi> in furniſhing me with 4000 Piſtols on Bills of Exchange which I would give him, for whoſe payment they would be Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57207:45"/>
the Crown undertaking to ſatisfie in caſe my Family ſhould delay him. He kept this ſumme readie for me in Gold, to deliver it at my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for fear I ſhould ſpend part of it before I left <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo oblige them to ſupply me with more, it being impoſſible for me to go without Money, and the neceſſity of affairs being ſuch that they could not paſs me by, nor retard my voyage without entirely ruining them.</p>
               <p>I cannot here forbear mentioning the genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a woman (though not very pertinent to the Subject I am ſpeaking of) who hearing of the care I took to provide Money for this enterpriſe; (now no longer a ſecret in <hi>Rome</hi>) brought me all that ſhe had in plate and jewels, and ten thouſand Crowns in Obligations on the Bank, which with thanks I refuſed, it being all the wealth ſhe had acquired by the induſtry and travel of many years.</p>
               <p>I reſolved to ſend to the late Dutcheſs of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> my mother, a Letter of Attorney for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of my whole eſtate, thereby to engage her more powerfully to my aſſiſtance, deſiring her to diſpoſe of all for furniſhing me with the greateſt ſumme ſhe poſſibly could, becauſe on ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply depended my eſtabliſhment or ruine.</p>
               <p>I was daily in continual Conferences with the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters and Cardinals of that Faction, to determine with them of all that was to be done for the ſervice and advantage of the Crown; but though I preſſed them concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct I was to follow, and demanded what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions they had for me? whether after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57207:45"/>
gained eſteem in <hi>Naples,</hi> on pretence of Eſtabliſhing their Republique I ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour an inſenſible traverſing their inclinations towards the King? it being impoſſible that the Nobility and People, as much ſeparated by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as affection, could ever ſo unite as to form the body of a Common-wealth, and govern themſelves, without being weary at laſt, and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Maſter, this unquiet and turbulent Nation having never been under any other Government than that of a Monarch, and (their natural jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie one of another conſidered) could never be at reſt but under the command of one alone. This was granted, but (apprehending it dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to propound to a violent and ſeditious people, a forein power, which they ever appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended) he told me, that the choice was to be left to themſelves of their form of Government and Maſter. The imagination alone that the King had any thoughts of becoming ſuch, would gain their hatred in ſtead of their friendſhip, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their Reconciliation with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; That on the other ſide the <hi>Pope,</hi> without whoſe authority no innovation could be made in that Kingdom, (he being Lord Paramont) might enter into alliance with the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to oppoſe it, fearing leſt <hi>France</hi> having gotten ſo firm a footing, might at laſt attempt to ſubdue the whole. That it would be a ſufficient advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the King, to cut off from <hi>Spain</hi> ſo potent a Kingdom, from which it derived its principal forces, and that by the loſs of it <hi>France</hi> would be as much raiſed above her as by a conqueſt:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57207:46"/>
that beſides this, ſuch perſons of that Countrey as ſought an innovation, to advantage themſelves by the honours and imployments of the Kingdom, by Governments of Towns and Provinces, which they had hitherto with regret ſeen in the hands of Strangers, would apprehend to be nothing the better, but rather that they ſhould be impoveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ruined, by the enriching other Countries with the tranſportation of their wealth. And laſtly reuniting to the enemy all ſuch as on any other grounds were againſt it, the party would be ſo much weakned it could not long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
               <p>That for ſuch powerful reaſons I was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to diſſipate all I poſſibly could the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they might have of any ſuch thought, giving out that <hi>France</hi> never acted but on Principles of Generoſity, altogether diſ-intereſſed, to relieve the oppreſſed, and procure the Liberty of thoſe that languiſhed under the tyranny of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; That the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at what price ſoever, were to be driven out of that Kingdom; that it was no matter what means were uſed towards ſo great a work; That the King would aſſiſt what reſolution ſoever ſhould be taken; That he had formerly conſented to the crowning Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> in the enterpriſe that was managed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſiege of <hi>Orbitelloy.</hi> That it was indifferent to him who ſhould profit by thoſe revolutions, and that whoſoever fortune favored ſhould have his ſupport, alliance, and protection, and that in this manner, without giving envie or enmitie to any, he ſhould reap greater advantages by the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57207:46"/>
                  <hi>Neapolitans</hi> than if they became his ſubjects: That he had formerly refuſed to verifie in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the uniting <hi>Catalonia</hi> to his crown, that he might not eternize the war, and deprive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the means of giving Peace to Chriſtendom when he ſhould think fit: That therefore they had neither Orders nor Inſtructions to give me; that I might (according to time and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures) act as I conceived moſt to the purpoſe; that I could not render a more important ſervice than the ſetting <hi>Naples</hi> at liberty, and depriving the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of that crown.</p>
               <p>After this the Cardinal of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Cicilia</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing with me to a Window, to ſpeak private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, told me; that I was not to have any Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Maſter <hi>de Fontenay,</hi> who was neither his friend nor mine, that he had no part in the ſecrets of the Cardinal his brother, of whoſe friendſhip and protection he aſſured me, in order to the great Obligation he had to me: That I ſhould confidently undertake my Voyage, in which I ſhould want nothing: That I ſhould be aſſiſted with Men, Money, Ammunition and Victuals, with a powerful Fleet, compoſed of many good Ships and Gallies, and to conclude, that <hi>France</hi> would abandon all other deſigns to ſupport me with her whole Forces.</p>
               <p>We parted after many embraces, equally ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with each other, he to write his Letters, of which he expected a ſucceſs as favourable, as I thought I ought to attend from mine.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57207:47"/>
to draw up the Letters of Attorney and other Commiſſions neceſſary for negotiating at Court, and with my Relations, according to the reſolutions I had taken, and ordering him to cauſe to be ſent me what Money he could raiſe, as the uſe fulleſt ſupply for preſervation of my life, and execution of my deſigns; I yet detained him ſome days, that he might take with him advice of the Bills of Exchange I was to draw on <hi>Paris,</hi> and carry certain news, as well of the condition of my affairs, as of the prefixed time for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, being withal deſirous that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches of the Cardinal of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57207:51"/>After the reading of which Letter, the ſaid <hi>Nicolo Maria Mannara</hi> told us, that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs in <hi>Naples</hi> was changed much for the worſe, ſince his laſt Voyage: that by artifice of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> different reports were every day caſt abroad, to the wonderful conſternation of the people; firſt, they endeavoured to perſwade them they ſhould receive no ſuccours from <hi>France,</hi> then that I never intended to come and head their Armies; and that my deſigne of expecting the Fleet to embarque on, was but a Specious pretence to free my ſelf from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement I had made, and the word I had too lightly given of coming to ſerve them; I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they would be abandoned, and that there was too little honour to be acquired, and too much peril to be undergone in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. That <hi>Lewis de Ferro,</hi> who had taken upon himſelf the quality of Ambaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> had offered them, in the Kings name, a million of Gold, fifty ſhips of war, thirty Gallies, ten Veſſels laden with Corn, fifty pieces of Canon, twelve thouſand foot, and four thouſand horſe, with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition ſufficient for above two years: That I was coming to put my ſelf into their hands as Hoſtage for all theſe things, and that he would give himſelf up as priſoner to ſecure them with the price of his head, in a word making ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Propoſals, as appeared incredible and ridiculous. That <hi>Gennaro</hi> was accuſed to have been too eaſily perſwaded of theſe chimerical ſuccours: That the people loſt all hope of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and their ſpirits were ſo dejected, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57207:51"/>
they were ready to throw down their arms (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more courage to defend themſelves) that they might no farther exaſperate the <hi>Spaniards</hi> againſt them; And although the apprehenſion of their revenge were very great, many perſons flattered themſelves, that they might eſcape it, ſuppoſing the puniſhment would fall onely upon the leaders. That many Cabals were already formed in the Town. That the rabble were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to make parties in the Streets to murmure. That nothing was heard but cries and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in a word, all poſſeſt with deſpair and deſolation. That notwithſtanding all this, it was generally believed that at my appearance amongſt them, they would recover their wonted vigour and courage, being by it confirmed that <hi>France</hi> would not forſake them, leſt ſhe ſhould ſo expoſe a perſon of my birth and conſideration; that they would yet take Patience for fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, but in caſe the Fleet appeared not by that time, they would yield, reſolved to defend themſelves no longer, and ſeek their own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in delivering up their Leaders.</p>
               <p>This news ſurpriſed us all, well knowing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility (what diligence ſoever could be uſed) of the Fleets preciſe arrival within that time. For (beſides that the equipping at <hi>Toulon</hi> was not yet compleated) had it been ready to ſet ſail, the incertainty of the winds, and perils of Navigation, (the Winter ſo far advanced,) would not admit a fixt day for its appearing before <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Mannara</hi> was ſenſible of the truth of what we ſaid, but withal repreſented, that having to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57207:52"/>
do with a multitude, turbulent, ſeditious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, it was impoſſible to ſway them by reaſon, That they muſt be convinced by ſomething pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and effectual, becauſe timorous and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous perſons are not eaſily encouraged, That my preſence alone could have ſo great effects, and that during the joy conceived thereupon, it would be eaſie to make the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> nay even the women take arms in order to the moſt deſperate attempts. That their hatred to <hi>Spain</hi> might cool, but never be extinguiſhed, and that there was none that would not (under my command) expoſe himſelf to death, and ſhed the laſt drop of his bloud for the ſafety and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Country. We reſolved to diſpatch at that very inſtant an expreſs, to haſten the coming of the Fleet, and I offered to go the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to <hi>Portolongone</hi> to attend it, and embarque as ſoon as it ſhould appear, gaining ſo three or four days time, that would have been ſpent in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me notice of its arrival, and my Journey af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receipt of the advice; And that if there were any other poſſibility of my getting to <hi>Naples,</hi> I would make no difficulty of any hazard thereby to re-incourage them, wiſhing rather to die than ſee the loſs of ſo favourable a conjuncture (which could never afterwards be recovered) for rendering to <hi>France</hi> ſo important and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſervice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mannara</hi> anſwered that if I would take ſo brave a reſolution, it was eaſie for me to enter <hi>Naples,</hi> in ſpight of any hinderance from the Ships and Gallies of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, that there
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57207:52"/>
were ſmall Feluccas ſo light and nimble, that neither Gallies nor Brigantines could overtake them, of which there was already experience, not one of thoſe which had been ſent ſince the arrival of the enemies fleet being loſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther going or coming; That if I would make uſe of them, he would ſend that very night for a number ſufficient to take me in with all my train, and that they ſhould arrive within three dayes.</p>
               <p>The Cardinals began to look one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, uncertain what reſolution I would take, too clearly diſcerning the danger, it being very hazardous (though I eſcaped the enemy) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my ſelf to the fury of that Sea, the Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof is more to be apprehended than of any other Coaſt of the Mediterranean, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Moneth of <hi>November,</hi> the time in which there ariſe in the Baies, wherewith it abounds, moſt furious tempeſts. <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay</hi> ſeeing the neceſſity of my paſſing, and not venturing to counſel me directly to it, ſaid, that in effect theſe Feluccas were ſo happy, and their Mariners of ſuch experience, that there was little peril in truſting to them, and that the paſſage was ſo ſhort, that taking a ſeaſonable time (which they well underſtood) there was ſcarcely any thing left to fortune. I ſmiled and looking upon him, told him, that if he deſired to have me attempt this paſſage, he had no more to do, but to tell me that it was uſeful to the Kings ſervice, and that I could not do any thing more agreeable, profitable or advantageous to <hi>France</hi>;

If ſo, never any man expoſed himſelf to greater and more evident danger than I was ready to undertake that inſtant, becauſe I gloried in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the peril and contemning it, and that the facility of enterpriſes deprived them of their rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. I told him finally that to ſerve the King I feared nothing, but would venture all with joy, and preſently ordered <hi>Nicolo Maria Mannara</hi> to ſend for Feluccas, and to let the people of <hi>Naples</hi> know, they ſhould ſuddenly ſee me amongſt them, armed for their defence, or I would die on the way. He then fell on his knees to give me thanks in the name of the people, to whoſe protection I was going, and particularly of <hi>Gennaro</hi> whoſe life I ſaved, it being impoſſible for him to preſerve it above a very few days, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs my preſence freed him from the danger he was expoſed to, and which was decreed againſt him, in caſe the Fleet appeared not in fourteen days, or if my arrival were delayed. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour thanked me in the Kings name for the zeal and paſſion that obliged me to ſo frank a hazarding my ſelf for the intereſts of his Crown, and aſſured me to recommend my reſolution according to its merits, it being indeed very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary: The Cardinals as ſurprized made the moſt obliging expreſſions, and flattering me on the action I undertook ſo generouſly, aſſured me that by it I ſurpaſſed all the Hero's of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and tranſcended thoſe of ancient <hi>Rome.</hi> I was told afterwards by the ſame deputy that they wanted Powder in <hi>Naples</hi>; and therefore reſolved to take with me all I poſſibly could, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57207:53"/>
he aſſured me that with my preſence, and this preſent ſupply, thoſe of <hi>France</hi> with the arrival of its Fleet would be expected patiently. I preſſed an immediate diſpatch of the poſt they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſend to haſten it, it being but reaſonable that my ſo reſolute embarking my ſelf on the Feluccas, ſhould rather advance than retard its diſpatch, ſo to leave me the leſs time in that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into which I ſo voluntarily caſt my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Whileſt <hi>Mannara</hi> went to write to <hi>Naples,</hi> the Kings Miniſters and I fell into diſcourſe, and they not forbearing to commend me; I told them, that if what I went about were an action ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, it could not fail of acquiring me great credit and authority in the opinion of the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> and that when I ſhould be eſtabliſhed by other as important ſervices, which I hoped very ſhortly to render them, I ſhould be in a condition to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to any thing, and they of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting nothing of my Propoſals: that then I might negotiate their reſigning themſelves to the King, and that I would cauſe ſo ſudden a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſuch a reſolution, that the Pope and the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> what jealouſie ſoever they conceived, ſhould want time to oppoſe it. They anſwered me as they had done before at our other Conferences, that the King was ſo farre from any ſuch thought, that he would not be ſo much as believed capable of it; that there was too little to be got, and too much to be hazarded by ſuch a propoſal. That the choice of a maſter was to be left to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and to fortune. That all (the <hi>Spaniard</hi> excepted) were
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57207:54"/>
alike to <hi>France,</hi> that nothing more was to be thought on than the driving out him, (as they had formerly ſaid, and the reſt to be left to time and hazard.</p>
               <p>I propoſed afterwards to contrive the Election either of the Kings brother, or of the (ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed) Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi>; They told me the laſt was old, incommoded by the Gout, and of little activity; that he loved repoſe, and would never quit <hi>France</hi> to raign in a Kingdom where the Crown was ill ſetled, and where he muſt be forced to be continually with his ſword drawn to ſupport it. That for the Kings brother, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy would hinder the people from fixing their thoughts on him, ſince many years muſt paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could be in a condition to protect or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them. I anſwered that his few years were in my opinion to his advantage, that by being bred up in the Countrey he would acquire its faſhions and cuſtoms, and ſo would afterwards paſs rather for a Native than Stranger. That du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Minority I might govern under him, which would be done eaſily and without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> having been ſome time accuſtomed to live under my command, and to receive my orders. To conclude, that I aſſured my ſelf (in caſe they approved this buſineſs) I ſhould with time bring it to effect. They told me they had received no orders in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; that they durſt preſcribe nothing to me not knowing the Courts intentions; that there was no more to be thought on but to gain the people liberty, and let them afterwards embrace
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57207:54"/>
ſuch form of Government as beſt pleaſed them; that what reſolution ſoever they took, the King would approve it, being reſolved to protect them without intereſt. What inſtructions then (ſaid I) have you to give me? I deſire good and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Orders, that I may in nothing diſpleaſe, but ſerve the King as much to his content as I hope to do to his advantage. They anſwered, manage well the war, and drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and for all elſe, regulate your ſelf as you ſhall judge to beſt purpoſe, and as you ſhall find good or evil Conjunctures. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after your arrival draw out 6000 foot and 2000 horſe to poſſeſs your ſelf of ſome poſt, which opening the way from hence to <hi>Naples,</hi> will give us eaſie convenience of correſponding, that we may act in Conſort, receiving often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from each other. We have only two advices to give you; the firſt, That you yield no precedence to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> what buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſoever you negotiate with him, and the other, That you never looſe the reſpect belongs to you; the multitude often abuſing the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Governours; and when one is ſo unfortunate as to fall into contempt, it is very difficult to riſe again; we muſt not therefore ſuffer to be dallied with, nor make our ſelves too common. Theſe were all the Inſtructions I could obtain from the Kings Miniſters: and ſince my departure, not receiving any other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it is an injury to tax me, that I would have made my ſelf independant, ſince I never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any other thought, but to pleaſe and ſerve
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57207:55"/>
the King, and in ſpight of all the troubles that have in his name been ſet afoot againſt me, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued firm in my reſpect and fidelity, and (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely abandoned, as I have been) choſe rather to hazard my life and liberty, than accept the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous offers his enemies made me, as ſhall appear in the Continuation of theſe Memoires.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I reſolved to ſend away the <hi>Sieur de Tilli,</hi> to the end he might ſolicite all ſuccours I wanted, and follow the Negotiation with which I had encharged him: promiſing to ſend a poſt after him, (which I did,) to overtake him on the way, and aſſure him of the day of my embarking, not ſuffering him to depart till he ſhould have ſeen me at ſea. I appointed him to paſs by <hi>Provence,</hi> and from thence ſpeedily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>Rome</hi> part of the Money I had deſigned for my expence, and for paying all my debts, leaving for ſecurity the greateſt part of the Family I had, with order to my Steward not to go from thence till he ſaw every man ſatisfied, and preſently after to come to me; ſince out of the ſumme I received from <hi>Valenti</hi> I could not take ſo much as would be neceſſary for it.</p>
               <p>Although the Arrival of the <hi>Sieur de Tilly,</hi> and all effected by it, happened not till long after my coming to <hi>Naples,</hi> that I may not confound the Coherence of my Narration, I think beſt to place it here. He was received with much Joy by all my relations, and with aſſurances that I ſhould be aſſiſted with whatever was neceſſary, and that all ſhould be hazarded rather than I want any thing. Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> prepared by his brothers
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57207:55"/>
diſpatches, received him very favourably, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commended and approved my zeal and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, promiſed I ſhould be ſupplied with all things, that he would take a particular care of it, and make it his own buſineſs. That I ſhould have aſſiſtances greater and with more expedition than I expected; in ſhort, he found the Court in as favourable inclinations for me as I could deſire. My relations cried me up the honour of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and the moſt glorious of all thoſe that had hitherto born our name, and ſupported it with ſo much ſplendor and reputation: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe fair Promiſes, and high and great expectations which never had effect, I was at laſt unhappily abandoned by all the World.</p>
               <p>I thought fit before my departure to ſound the Popes inclinations, and ſee if the friendſhip he had promiſed me were firm and ſolid enough to prevent his oppoſal of my deſigns: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conſideration of <hi>Spain</hi> would not hinder him from being favourable to me, by concerning himſelf in an affair whoſe good or evil ſucceſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended much on the part he ſhould take, by the balance his authority would give to ſuch ſide as he ſhould diſcourage or protect. I ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand audience, which he granted me with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, out of the curioſitie he had to know the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of all that had been negotiated. I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him an exact account of all that had been treated on to that time, and deſiring his Councel touching the conduct I was to follow, he told me I ought to let looſe the reins to the carriere of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57207:56"/>
my good fortune, which he deſired to ſee eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with ſolidity, and minded me, that having many things to fear, I ought to have a continual diſtruſt, and my eyes ever open, not neglecting or contemning the ſmalleſt things, which might all be of concernment to me, ſince no miſadventure could happen to me which would coſt me leſs than my life; that I ſhould not depend on the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> reſiding in his Court, the greateſt part of whom were not my friends, and who in order to their own advantages would give out, that by their negotiations and addreſſes, they were the authors of all the good events procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by my diligence and danger: That in caſe I found it eaſie to cauſe the whole Kingdom to revolt, they would attribute it to the diſpoſition of the time, and the general hatred of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government; that they would perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that any other as well as I might have done the ſame; and by this elevating their hopes, would uſe their endeavours to blaſt my fame and obſtruct the eſtabliſhment of my authority; That unknown to me they would manage ſecret negotiations, and form a hundered cabals contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to me, endeavouring to maintain diviſions to profit by them. That they would cauſe the Fleet to appear without ſending me aſſiſtance, cauſe ſupplyes to be ſhewn but not delivered, to the end that the deſpairing people might by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be compelled to caſt themſelves into the arms of <hi>France,</hi> and ſubmit to her. That this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which they would not fail to undertake, would deſtroy the buſineſs, and precipitate me,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57207:56"/>
knowing as he did the nature of that people, who are much greater enemies to the <hi>French</hi> than <hi>Spaniſh</hi> authority, becauſe of the violent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous humor of our Nation, and that onely from this might ariſe the deſolation of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the re-eſtabliſhment of all things in their firſt condition; That I ought to diſtruſt equally both crowns, of which the leaſt ſuſpected would do me moſt miſchief. That the difference between the Nobility and People would hinder all my Progreſſions; that I ſhould be able to effect nothing till I had reunited them, that this ought to be my onely care and principal employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which if I could compaſs, the conqueſt of that Kingdom was infallible; That he could aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me that the Nobility were more incenſed and more deſirous of Liberty than the people, though they diſſembled their true reſentments: That all <hi>Italy</hi> would oppoſe the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>French,</hi> and would be favourable to that of a particular Prince; That on this foundation I was to build my hopes, and regulate my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: That he loved not the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo much as was imagined; That he would look on all as an indifferent father, without concerning or declaring himſelf on either ſide. That the rigors and vexations under which that whole Kingdom long groaned, had drawn down the indignation of Heaven, the effects whereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps were now at hand; That divine vengeance though ſlow, never fails of arriving at laſt; and that I ſhould have a care to avoid the ſnares would be laid for me on all ſides, that I ſhould
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57207:57"/>
meet them at every ſtep I made; that I was to avoid them by Prudence, of which I had great need in an enterpriſe of ſo much difficulty and glory; That he offered me his Prayers, which he would continually pour out for the preſervation of a perſon ſo dear to him, and for whom he had the ſame tenderneſs a father hath for his beloved ſon: and at parting, after he had given me his bleſſing, embracing me with tears in his eyes, told me, That he was indifferent who hereafter ſhould preſent him the white Nag, which he would as willingly receive from my hand as any other.</p>
               <p>I beſought him yet to hear a word I had to ſay to him, (which I thought neceſſary, the better to ſound his intentions, and diſcover his moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts) and expreſſing my acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his many favours during my ſtay at <hi>Rome,</hi> and giving him a thouſand thanks, I aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him that if he had any deſign of making ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the preſent revolutions, and reunite <hi>Naples</hi> to the Papacie, which by very good right belonged to it more than to any whoſoever, I was ſo much devoted to his ſervice, that I proffered my interpoſal and aſſiſtance, deſiring no other recompence than the glory of ſerving him; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which I thought to find great facility, in the preſent diſpoſitions of the Nobility and People of that Kingdom. He thanked me for my good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and told me, he was now too old to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect time for ſo great a deſign; That it would be the ruine of his family, and draw more envy, and powerful enmity againſt his Relations, than they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57207:57"/>
would be able to ſupport themſelves againſt, after his death. That the example of <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth made him wiſe: and in fine, that he would not begin ſo great a work to leave it imperfect: That his ambition was moderate, and ſought not for his Relations more than ſuch a competent fortune as they might maintain; That he was obliged to me for the kindneſs of my offer; but that he would not at all concern himſelf in any thing that was to be done, which he would look on as an indifferent Spectator; that his wiſhes ſhould be on my ſide, and that my advantages would as ſenſibly concern him as his own: and confirming all he had ſaid to me, again embraced me and gave me his bleſſing. Having kiſſed his feet I took leave, aſſuring him that as ſoon as I ſhould be departed, <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay</hi> ſhould give him an account of my paſſage towards <hi>Naples,</hi> with the knowledge, conſent, and order of the King, as he had promiſed, and punctually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the day after my embarking.</p>
               <p>That night I deſired the Ambaſſadour and the reſt of the Kings Miniſters to ſend ſome one to continue with me on their behalf to take charge of the ciphers. They propounded the <hi>Sieur de Ceriſantes</hi> for want of any other at that time capable of ſuch an employment; Having then no Secretary, and it being impoſſible for me to be without one, I deſired one of their recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: They propoſed the <hi>Sieur Fabrani,</hi> who had formerly been imployed in ſervice of the <hi>Barbarines,</hi> and principally in that of Cardinal <hi>Antonio.</hi> He followed me in my Voyage, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57207:58"/>
ſerved me, till the day of my priſon; He had good parts, but ſpoke no <hi>French,</hi> and underſtood it but indifferently, which gave occaſion to ſome complaints were made of me at Court, and at which ſuch as loved me not would have taken occaſions to my prejudice. All the diſpatches I made from <hi>Naples</hi> were in <hi>Italian,</hi> which was excepted againſt, as if I pretended to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate my ſelf from <hi>France,</hi> and make my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant, refuſing to make uſe of that Language. But it may eaſily be underſtood that this was a pure effect of neceſſity, and not of choice; the preſſure of affairs that lay on me night and day, gave me not time to write with mine own hand, and in this I was forced to eaſe my ſelf by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Sieur Fabrani,</hi> who taking only my Orders and Conceptions, to write them down, could do it in no other than in that Language was known to him; beſides all which having to do with diſtruſtful people I was forced to ſhew them all my diſpatches, which they could not have underſtood in <hi>French</hi>; This is ſo innocent and convincing that I need no longer juſtifie my ſelf of ſo frivolous an accuſation: which I touched not at firſt, but by the by to make appear, that nothing was omitted towards doing me ill offices, to which it was very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary I ſhould give no occaſion by my comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, uſe being made of a matter of ſo ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
               <p>The Feluccas being at laſt arrived, I ſeriouſly prepared my ſelf to be gone, taking leave of all ſuch perſons as I had reſpect and friendſhip for;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57207:58"/>
And the Cardinal of <hi>Eſte</hi> being with his brother the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> I writ to him, to acquaint him with my adventures, and take leave of him; being very ſorry I could not in perſon perform that duty, to which I was obliged, not onely by the relation of Kindred, and near friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, but in that (notwithſtanding my refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals out of fear of incommoding him) he had given me the uſe of his Equipage and Coaches all the while I ſtayed in <hi>Rome</hi>; I writ alſo to Cardinal <hi>Grimaldi,</hi> who was at <hi>Modena</hi> the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letter.</p>

One Evening they came to tell me of the arrival of a Felucca: my deſire of news cauſed me to ſend for the Mariners, who acquainted me that they had brought with them an old advocate called <hi>Franciſco de Paſti,</hi> to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate ſomething on behalf of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay</hi> concealed from me as well his Arrival as his Negotiation, of which I ſeemed to him to have no knowledge nor ſuſpition, learning by this what I was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him, who began with me in a faſhion ſo diſobliging, hiding from me affairs in which I had ſo great concernment. <hi>Franciſco de Paſti</hi> at his return acquainted me with all things, and I think, ſhame obliged the Ambaſſadour to make this a ſecret to me, not willing I ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how eaſily he ſwallowed whatſoever was propounded to him.

And though they were all of opinion that I ſhould embark diſguiſed; I judged it would be eaſie to kill me by the way, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not wanting Spies to give them notice of the time and manner of my departure, and therefore deſired the Ambaſſador to command all the <hi>French</hi> that were in <hi>Rome</hi> to take horſe and accompany me, eſteeming this not onely more honorable but more ſafe, becauſe I could not be attacqued but by a conſiderable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which the Pope would not ſuffer to be drawn together in his Dominions.</p>

Having heard Maſs and given Order for all that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary towards ſo precipitated a Voyage, after Dinner, quitting my Court habit, for ſuch as ſuited with a Camp, I appeared in Buff, and publiſhed to all whom the news had invited to me, that I was going for <hi>Naples,</hi> firmly reſolved either to periſh or drive thence the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Ambaſſadour carried me in his Coach as farr as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s, accompanied by the Abbots of S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>la Feuillade,</hi> and followed on horſeback by all the <hi>French</hi> that were in <hi>Rome,</hi> the horſe I was to make uſe of being led by me.

After my Devotions before the miraculous Crucifix of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, I took leave of the Ambaſſador, and getting on horſeback, my Trumpet ſounding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan my march ſtreight to <hi>Fiumicine,</hi> where ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving about two in the Morning, I viſited the Felucca's that waited for me, amongſt which I choſe the leaſt and lighteſt, the more eaſily to eſcape the enemies Gallies and Brigantines. I was accompanied by two and twenty perſons in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57207:62"/>
all, which number was made up of the Envoies of the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſome Officers, and five or ſix of my domeſticks; and Captain <hi>Andrea Portaro</hi> who commanded the Felucca, in which I went my ſelf, repreſenting that it would be over-charged if I took with me a Chamberlain and a Trumpet, I removed the latter to another Veſſel. My little Fleet was compoſed of three Brigantines and eight Felucca's, four of which were laden with ſix thouſand weight of Powder I had bought at <hi>Palo</hi> (a Sea-town belonging to the Duke of <hi>Bracciano</hi>) to carry to <hi>Naples,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been informed that the people wanted it. I carried alſo four thouſand Piſtols, which did me good ſervice, as will appear hereafter, it being the onely ſumme I could obtain from abroad, during the whole ſpace of five moneths, wherein I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained my ſelf without any ſupplies, unleſs two thouſand Crowns brought me by the remainder of the Servants I left at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> about four in the Morning I ſet ſail, the weather favourable and ſomewhat ſharp, and gave a Servant called <hi>Callet</hi> my diſpatches for the Court, with order to let them know he had ſeen me embarque, and that the next news to be expected of me was my death or arrival at <hi>Naples.</hi> About Noon we diſcovered two Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantines with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours, and preſently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them, and cauſing them to come aboard found they were <hi>Sicilians,</hi> laden with Limons and other Fruits for <hi>Rome:</hi> I could learn nothing of them, they not having touched at <hi>Naples,</hi> and let them ſteer on their courſe conditionally that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57207:62"/>
they ſhould give account to the Ambaſſador of the time and place of their meeting me. About four in the Evening I diſcovered the Iſle of <hi>Pons,</hi> from whence at the ſame time I ſaw two Gallies come forth, who made a ſmoke as a ſignal to three other that were at <hi>Terracine,</hi> who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately anſwered them, and the whole Coaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſuch ſmoke advertiſed of my Paſſage, five other Gallies lying in <hi>Gaeta</hi> made themſelves ready to oppoſe it. I preſently called together all the Felucca's, to give them order to let me go alone, forbidding them to follow me, as ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Gallies would purſue the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and mine being alone would be leſs obſerved and followed. At the ſame time I cauſed mine to ſtrike ſail, and row near the ſhore, whoſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow (night approaching) would ſecure me from being ſeen by the Gallies. The Seamen were of opinion, that coming near <hi>Gaeta</hi> we ſhould put out to Sea, but I cauſed them to ſteer right upon <hi>Rolands</hi> tower, that ſeeming a friend I might get a great way off before they diſcovered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and their Gallies could weigh Anchor. I paſſed ſo near the Caſtle, that I anſwered the Sentrie, that I was an Expreſs ſent to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, but in ſtead of coming to Anchor in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour I put off, and then the Gallies made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to follow: But a ſtrong wind ariſing, and driving right into the mouth of the Haven, hindered them, what endeavours ſoever they made, from getting out. I would have taken the advantage of this freſh gale for ſetting ſail, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57207:63"/>
getting forward, but we loſt our Maſt and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcaped overſetting.</p>
            <p>Two Waves ſplit two Rudders one after the other, ſo that being fain to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke uſe of an Ore in their ſtead, with a great deal of toil and danger, we paſſed the Bay, and were glad to find our ſelves under ſhelter of the Land.</p>
            <p>At day break we were near the Iſle of <hi>Iſchia,</hi> where the Seamen would have perſwaded me to ſeek a retreat, to paſs the day and make the eaſier entrance into <hi>Naples</hi> by night: but I oppoſed, apprehending to be diſcovered, either by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity of ſome of them, or ſome other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of accident, and ſo fall into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands without ſtriking ſtroke; Fear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them obſtinate in their opinion, I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to draw my ſword, and compel them to row. Soon after we diſcovered the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet riding before it: and that I might the better reſolve what was to be done, I moſt exactly informed my ſelf what poſts were poſſeſſed by the enemy, and inquired who was maſter of the ground, both above and below the City. Then I commanded them to ſteer right with the Admiral that carried the flag, that I might be unſuſpected and ſo gain time to paſs, before they could launch their long Boats and Shalops. When I was about twice canon ſhot from the Admiral, in ſtead of ſteering ſtreight to the Town, I took my courſe lower, towards the Greek Tower, that the Felucca's of <hi>Chiay</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Lucy</hi> might not cut off my way: and to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57207:63"/>
give notice to the Town of my arrival, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Mariners, even whileſt they paſſed through the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, to cry out that I was aboard, and ſtanding up on the poop made a ſign with my Hat, to cauſe their foot to draw out, and receive me at my landing. I was immediately purſued by all Veſſels with Oares that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my could poſſibly caſt into the Sea, and fired on by all the Artillery of the Caſtles, Haven, Ships and Gallies. I fell in with the Shore a league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Town, and ordering the Muſquetiers that were ſent to receive me, to give continual fire upon the enemies Boats, that preſſed me hard, coaſted <hi>Rieſene</hi> and <hi>Portici,</hi> and would not land till (under favour of this skirmiſh, amidſt the noiſe of all the enemies Canon) I arrived at the place of the Cavalerice, in the ſuburbs of <hi>Loretto.</hi> There leaping a ſhore, <hi>Friday</hi> the fifteenth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eleven a clock, I was received with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible applauſes of an infinite number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who having, for a good ſpace, carried me in the air, at length mounted me on a fair Courſer provided for me, on which I made my entry into the Town, where I alighted at the Church of our Lady of the Carmelites, to give thanks for the good ſucceſs of my paſſage.</p>
            <p>The joy of the people is inexpreſſible, as well as the reſpects and teſtimonies of affection they rendered me, which extended even to admiration and idolatry, burning incenſe at the noſtrils of my horſe; but that which ſeemed to me moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and of happieſt <hi>Omen</hi> was, that of ſo innumerable a multitude aſſembled to ſee my
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57207:64"/>
landing, there was not any one hurt by more than a thouſand Canon ſhot from the Caſtles, Haven, Ships and Gallies. Maſs being ended, <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s brother in law came to make me a Complement in his name, with excuſes for his not meeting me, as not thinking himſelf ſecure out of the Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites tower, where with much impatience he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended me. I went immediately and found him on a little terraſs, at the entrance of his lodging, where by a Complement, ill enough expreſſed, as farre as his ignorance and incapacity would permit, he teſtified his joy to ſee me, for had I not arrived, he was the next day to have been delivered to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and conſequently to death; of which his fortune reſpited the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution onely for ſix or ſeven Moneths. Many people were aſſembled to be Spectators of this interview, whoſe circumſtances might well enough incite curioſity. I was not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the blindneſs of the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> to have choſen ſuch a man their General; his perſon ſeemed to me ſo extraordinary that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit (with the loſs of as little time as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) to give you his picture. He was a little man, very ill made, and very black, his eyes ſunk in his head, ſhort hair which diſcovered large ears, a wide mouth, his beard cloſe cut and beginning to be gray, his voice full and very hoarſe, he could not ſpeak two words without ſtammering, ever unquiet, and ſo very timorous that the leaſt noiſe made him tremble. He was attended by a matter of twenty guards of as ill men as himſelf. He wore a Buff-coat with ſleeves of red Velvet and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57207:64"/>
Scarlet Breeches, with a Cap of Cloth of Gold of the ſame colour on his Head, which he hardly took the pains to take off when he ſaluted me; he had a Girdle of red Velvet furniſhed with three Piſtols on each ſide; he wore no ſword, but in ſtead of it carried a great <hi>Blunderbus</hi> in his hand. His firſt Civility was the taking off my Hat, and in ſtead of it cauſing to be brought me in a Silver Baſon ſuch a Cap as his own, and then taking me by the Hand led me into his Hall, whoſe doors he very carefully cauſed to be ſhut, with moſt ſtrict Order to his Guards to let none enter, leſt they ſhould cut his throat. As ſoon as we were ſeated I preſented him <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay</hi>'s Letter, with aſſurance (as I had been ordered) of the protection of <hi>France,</hi> and of the coming of the Fleet, and all ſuch Supplyes as the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> ſhould ſtand in need of towards attaining their Liberty, and deliverance from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> oppreſſion. He anſwered me with much more ſatisfaction than eloquence, and having opened the Letter I delivered him, ran it over with his eyes, and having turned upwards every one of the four ſides, caſt it to me again, telling me he could not read, and deſiring me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with its Contents.</p>
            <p>Whileſt this paſſed, ſome body knocked at the door as if they intended to break it down: this gave us an alarm, and the cry from without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> that was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſee me, the door was opened, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my ſelf to go and receive him with the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony due to his character, I was amazed to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57207:65"/>
ſee a man without a Hat, his ſword drawn, two great Chapelets like a Hermites about his neck, on the one whereof he ſaid he prayed for the King, and on the other for the People, who caſting himſelf down at his full length, and throwing away his Sword, embracing my legs kiſſed my feet; with much ado I raiſed him up, and was doubtful whether I ſhould give him <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay</hi>'s Letter, which treated him with the quality of Excellence, and the Kings Ambaſſador, ſeeing in the perſon of <hi>Sieur Lewis del Ferro</hi> rather the figure of a mad man broke out of <hi>Bedlam</hi> than of the Miniſter of a great Crown; but ſuppoſing he might have ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed good quality that I had not yet diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, conſidering the great credit he which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged me with that Letter, aſſured me he had acquired amongſt the people, I thought my ſelf obliged to deliver it, leſt I might be blamed for not executing punctually what had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned me.</p>
            <p>We heard a great noiſe in the Street, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by a tumult of ſuch people as demanded to ſee me; to ſatisfie their curioſity I went to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and <hi>Gennaro</hi> having cauſed to be brought me in two Baſons, two Bags of Money, one of Gold and the other of Silver, I caſt it amongſt the people, and whileſt they were at cuffs about gathering it up, I thought it was time to call for Dinner, having eaten nothing ſince my departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe of the roughneſs of the Sea. <hi>Gennaro</hi> made excuſes for the ill cheer he ſhould give me, not daring, for fear of poiſon, to make
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57207:65"/>
uſe of any other Cook than his Wife, as improper for that imployment as perſonating the Lady of quality. She brought the firſt Diſh, having on a Gown of Skie-coloured wrought Satin embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Silver, with a Farthingale, a Chain of Jewels, and a fair Necklace of Pearl, with Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of Diamonds in her Ears, all plundered from the Dutcheſs of <hi>Matalone:</hi> and in this ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly equipage it was pleaſant to ſee her dreſs meat, ſcoure diſhes and divert her ſelf in the afternoon with waſhing and ſmoothing Linen. I invited <hi>Lewis del Ferro,</hi> as Ambaſſador, to waſh and ſit down with us; But <hi>Gennaro</hi> told me, Sure I was not in earneſt, for he had wont to uſe him like a dog; and when I called for drink, he fetched it, ſaying, it belonged onely to him to ſerve me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his quality: He preſented me the Cup on his knees, which when I would not permit, <hi>Gennaro</hi> told me he ſerved him in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which preſently after I ſaw verified. Dinner laſted not long, and all things were ſo naſtie and unſavory, that had it not been for the Bread, Wine, Sallad and Fruit, which were indeed excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, I had run hazard of ſtarving.</p>
            <p>Ariſing from Table I deſired the Magiſtrates of the Town might be ſent for, and the Council, which, by reaſon of his incapacity, had been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to <hi>Gennaro,</hi> conſiſting of one perſon of every quarter, and called Expreſſes by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the General Officers and Colonels, with all others that had any authority, that I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my ſelf of the condition of affairs, and (without loſs of time) provide for all things
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57207:66"/>
that might be neceſſary, redreſs diſorders, put my ſelf in a condition to make a vigorous defence againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and gain time for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Fleet, and the ſuccors I had given this great City cauſe to expect from the Kings power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful protection.</p>
            <p>I found there remained Victuals for no more than twelve or fourteen days: That the Stock deſigned for buying more had been maliciouſly conſumed: That of the hundred and ſeventy thouſand men I was made believe at <hi>Rome</hi> I ſhould find in arms, there were ſcarce four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot, and three hundred horſe in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do ſervice, diſpoſed into Regiments and particular Companies, under incapable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Officers: That the reſt of the people being wearied out would no longer bear arms, and that the ſmall number imployed on the Guard, every one of his own quarter refuſed to ſtay the night on their poſt, unleſs they received daily pay; That there was no more Powder but what I brought with me; That there was no money; That the diviſion and enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Gennaro Anneſe</hi> and <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> chief of the <hi>Concherie,</hi> (accuſing each other of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and correſpondence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that not without ſome ground, as I afterwards diſcovered) was arrived at ſuch a height, that they thought of nothing but their entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keeping exact Guards againſt each other, for fear thoſe of the quarter of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie</hi> ſhould attempt on thoſe of the Market: which gave all the reſt of the Town apprehenſion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57207:66"/>
that its ſack and ruine might be the effect of this ill underſtanding, of which the enemy would not fail to make his advantage.</p>
            <p>Whileſt I informed my ſelf of the bad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which the Town of <hi>Naples</hi> was reduced, two things happened of very great conſideration, and capable to ſurprize and aſtoniſh any man, that had not reſolved himſelf againſt all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>A Butcher one of the City Captains, called <hi>Jommo Ropolo,</hi> a man ſeditious and violent, broke down the door of the chamber where we were at Council, and coming up to <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and calling him Traytor, with all his force gave him three or four blows on the neck, which was bare, with the flat of his hand, ſwearing he would cut off his head, from which nothing detained him but my preſence, and the reſpect he bore me. <hi>Gennaro</hi> caſt himſelf at his feet weeping, and embracing his knees, begged his life. I interpoſed to make them friends, and did it as having authoritie, ſending <hi>Jommo Ropolo</hi> to his quarter, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to viſit the next morning, as well as all the reſt of the City, appointing him in the mean time to keep good Guards.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as this difference was reconciled, and we had retaken our places for continuing the Council, we were interrupted again by a great noiſe of a concourſe of people with ſuch cries and lamentations as made it evident ſome notable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief had happened: It was a famous <hi>Bandite</hi> called <hi>Jacomo Roſſo,</hi> who having marched out of <hi>Naples</hi> three or four days before, with about 15
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57207:67"/>
hundred foot, and three or four hundred horſe, to keep the Town of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Anastaſio,</hi> and ſome others at the foot of the Mountain of <hi>Somma,</hi> from whence great ſupplies of Corn were had, againſt the body of the Nobility, had been ſo fiercely charged, that the greateſt number of his men were cut in pieces, and ſeveral taken Priſoners; the few that eſcaped with him, all hurt, and he himſelf with two cuts of a Sword, one on his face and the other on his head: This ſad Spectacle gave ſo great aſtoniſhment, that had not the people been encouraged by my arrival they had probably laid down their arms. The Duke of <hi>Matalone,</hi> Earl of <hi>Converſano,</hi> Prince of <hi>Ottaino, Dom Ferrante Carracciolo,</hi> and other Gentlemen, having vigorouſly purſued the rout, even to the ſuburbs of the Town, the people found themſelves ſhut up, without hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any more Proviſions from abroad; This unhappy Combat having cauſed all ſuch places as held for them to change ſide, and even thoſe who (favourable to them that very morning,) had facilitated my landing, and without whom I could not have avoided falling into the hands of the enemy. Let all men judge by this condition in which I found things at my arrival, whether I had not need of an extraordinary reſolution not to be dejected at ſo many undiſcerned accidents, finding nothing without my ſelf to depend on, being abandoned by all the world, and generally unprovided of all that was neceſſary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a place in which I was blocked up.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the Day was ſpent in Council,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57207:67"/>
every moment interrupted by the arrival of thoſe <hi>Gennaro</hi> had ſent out to plunder ſuch houſes, as he had been told would afford good booties, by concealed Plate or other moveables of value, this being his chief imployment: in the mean time leaving to chance the conduct of all other affairs, ſo that we roſe not till the night was farre ſpent, yet without my getting any better information of the condition of the Town, the force of its troops, or its neceſſities, than at the inſtance of my arrival; By this I judged I was to expect no other light than what I could gain my ſelf by care and vigilance.</p>
            <p>I paſſed the remainder of the Evening in receiving the Complements of many particular perſons without diſcovering any thing but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary confuſion, and a general incapacity in all the chiefs, whether civil or militarie. Their hatred of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was no otherways ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed than by injurious Speeches; and their wearineſs of having been ſo long in arms was ſo great, that no man would tarry all night at the advanced Poſts, unleſs very well pay'd; the richer ſort cauſing their duty to be done by poor miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretches, themſelves going home and lying at their houſes.</p>
            <p>I could not diſcover who had the greateſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the Captains of every quarter comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding without dependance on one another; and had not acquired their charges either by merit or capacity, but onely by having talked lowder and made more noiſe than their fellows: <hi>Gennaro</hi> himſelf, as much General as he was, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57207:68"/>
by no body, though feared by reaſon of the train he had acquired out of the ſcum of the people, and principally of the market-place, to whom he gave liberty to plunder. His election, neither having been made by the City-Council, nor approved by any of its inhabitants, (as all in private reported) but by five or ſix hundred bare-footed Boys, who rambling about the Town with a long Staff and Hook at the end of it with a Fagot, offered a hundred inſolencies to the Citizens, threatning to fire the houſes of all ſuch as refuſed to comply with them. Theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>azars, for that was the title this rabble gave themſelves, had a kindneſs for him, becauſe he ſuffered all manner of licentiouſneſs, even to an unpuniſhable loſs of reſpect to himſelf every moment, and becauſe they had ſeen him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder than any elſe in affronting the unfortunate <hi>Don Franciſco Toralte,</hi> whoſe body he cauſed to be inhumanely dragged through the Streets after his death. By this may eaſily be judged how farr his perſon was to be depended on, and whether I deſerved not pity to ſee my ſelf engaged in ſo great a diſorder, without knowing either whom to diſtruſt, or in whom to put confidence.</p>
            <p>It being now very late and I wanting reſt, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one retired, and I had a Supper brought as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome and diſtaſteful as my Dinner, it laſted not long, and inquiring in what part they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared me a bed, I was not a little ſurprized when <hi>Gennaro</hi> told me I ſhould lie with him; having refuſed this as much as poſſibly I could, out of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of not incommoding his wife by taking her

place, he told me ſhe ſhould lie on a Quilt before the fire with her Siſter, and that it concerned his ſafety to ſhare his bed with me, without which his enemies would cut his throat, the reſpect of my perſon being the onely means to ſecure him from that danger, whoſe apprehenſion had ſo ſtrongly prepoſſeſt him, that he awaked twenty times in the night in diſorder, and with tears in his eyes embracing me, beſought me to ſave his life, and ſecure him from thoſe that would murther him. He conducted me to lodge in his Kitchin, where I found a very rich Bed of cloth of Gold, and at the feet of it in a Cradle a little Blacka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſlave about two years old full of the Small Pox: a great deal of Plate both white and guilt, heaped up in the middle of the Room, many Cabinets half open, out of which tumbled Chains and Bracelets of Pearl and other Jewels, ſome bags of Silver and ſome of Gold half ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on the ground, very rich Houſhold-Stuff, and many fair Pictures thrown up and down diſorderly, which made ſufficiently appear what profit he had made by plundering the houſes of the richeſt and beſt qualified Perſons of the Town; though he could never be induced to aſſiſt the people with the ſmalleſt part of it, either to buy Ammunition or Victuals, for paying the Troops already raiſed, or making new Levies; This put me in a rage, to ſee my ſelf in want of every thing, and yet to have ſo conſiderable Supplies at hand, which I might make no uſe of.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide of the Kitchin were all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57207:69"/>
in great Quantity, which had been plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in ſeveral Quarters, with all manner of arms, all in an extraordinary confuſion. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and Contributions he daily received of all manner of Veniſon and wild Fowl powdered, and all the Walls tapiſtried with whatever is edible.</p>
            <p>This was the ſumptuous apartment prepared for entertaining me, and where even oppreſſed with ſleep, I thought of nothing but a ſpeedie unclothing my ſelf to get into bed. <hi>Lewis del Ferro</hi> would ſuffer none to come near to pull off my Boots, maintaining it belonged to him alone to do me all manner of Services, but I refuſed him, till <hi>Gennaro</hi> adviſing me to let him do it, cauſed his own Stockins to be pulled off to give me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which I afterwards followed without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and got into Bed as faſt as I could. <hi>Gennaro</hi> came preſently to lie down by me, and ſetting a candle on the bed, and unbinding his legg to dreſs it, I asked if he had received any wound? He anſwered, that being naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and full of humors, a Phyſitian his Friend had adviſed him to make uſe of a remedy, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to name, leſt its mention offend others ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks as much as its ſight did mine.</p>
            <p>You have heard now how I paſſed the firſt day of my arrival in <hi>Naples,</hi> and my reception, whoſe diſagreeable beginning (the firſt ſurpriſal of ſleep over) made me paſs very thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the remainder of the night, with many reflections on the preſent condition of my affairs, and the dangers I was to undergo. But at laſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57207:69"/>
reſolved my ſelf againſt all events whatever, I expected day with extreme impatience, that I might begin to work all things neceſſary as well for preſervation of the place into which I had caſt my ſelf, as my own particular, ſince my ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ruine could no longer depend on any but my ſelf, and that my ſelf alone muſt become the artificer of my good or evil fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Morning, as ſoon as I was up, I went with <hi>Gennaro</hi> to hear Maſs at the <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> who failed not (for upholding his quality of the peoples General) to take the right hand of me. <hi>Lewis del Ferro</hi> went before us bare-headed, carrying a naked Sword, and (in compliance with the <hi>French mode,</hi>) with a great deal of hair; He had a black Perriwig made of a horſes tail, ſuch as on our Theaters are worn by Furies, and inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly cried out, Let the people live, and General <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>; and tranſported either with joy or madneſs, ſtruck with his ſword all that came in his way, and hurt ſo many he had like to have made a tumult. To be quit of him I was fain to give him an Employment. I found the <hi>Carmelites</hi> at the great Gate of their Church with their Croſs and holy Water, and their <hi>Prior</hi> having made me a Speech, they began to ſing <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and I was conducted to the rail of the high Altar to hear Maſs on a Carpet was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for me, where <hi>Gennaro</hi> kneeled on my right hand. After Maſs I was reconducted in the ſame manner, with the Applauſes and Benedictions of all the people; at the Church-door ſtood a horſe readie, that I might ſee the town and viſit the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57207:70"/>
Quarters, and <hi>Gennaro</hi> having mounted a mettled Courſer, ſpurring him to come up to me, the horſe made a bound and caſt him over his ears, flat on his length at my feet; which ſome looked on as an ill <hi>omen</hi> for him: who for fear of the like, all the reſt of the way, cauſed himſelf to be held in his ſaddle by two men, and his horſe to be led by the bridle. Having paſſed over the Market-place, where a multitude of people were aſſembled to ſee me, I went to viſit the quarter of the <hi>Concherie,</hi> where I found <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> in arms at the head of his men, who after a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement made his excuſes, for not having waited on me, becauſe he never went into <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s houſe, for whom he had an extraordinary aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and as he pretended a very great affection, and reſpect for me, I told him I ſhould reckon him amongſt my friends, and that I would take a particular care of his fortune. I immediately made him Colonel of the foot Regiment I was about to raiſe in my name, and appointed him to be alwayes near me, to carry about my Orders in qualitie of Adjutant General: This I did to gain him, being one of the moſt conſiderable, and moſt followed of the people: and as well to have a nearer eye on him, becauſe of the juſt diſtruſt I had been told I was to have of him. He made great acknowledgements of theſe favours, with proteſtation to depend all his life abſolutely on my pleaſure; I preſently put him to the trial, commanding him to be friends with <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and ever after hold a good correſpondence with him; <hi>Gennaro,</hi> who very much feared him, as the moſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57207:70"/>
dangerous of his enemies, ſeemed very glad of this reconciliation, which the better to confirm, <hi>Pepe Palombe's</hi> wife being that day brought a bed, I obliged <hi>Gennaro</hi> to be Godfather. Inſtantly I cauſed all the entrenchments they had made againſt each other to be ſlighted, and ordered them to employ their Souldiers for the future againſt the common enemy only, and live with the correſpondence of good Compatriots and Brothers. This accommodation gave as great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to all the people as diſpleaſure (as I was told) to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Afterwards I viſited all the quarters of the Town, followed by above fifty thouſand perſons. <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſarie General of the Proviſions, told me, that in ſo publique a rejoycing it was not juſt that any ſhould remain in miſery, and that therefore it were good to ſet open the priſons, which was done as I paſſed before any of their gates, more particularly at the <hi>Vicarie,</hi> the ancient Palace of the Kings of <hi>Naples,</hi> where the Judges of ſeveral Tribunals aſſemble to do juſtice, and where the greateſt number of Priſoners are ſhut up; and what oppoſition ſoever <hi>Gennaro</hi> endeavoured to make, I cauſed ſuch Gentlemen to be delivered as he would have put to death, to ſatisfie his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt the Nobility: to whom I ordered the Marquis of <hi>Monte Silvano</hi> of the familie of <hi>Brancaccio,</hi> and an old Colonel of Foot called <hi>Bartolomeo Griffo,</hi> and ſome other Gentlemen, to give aſſurance in my name, that I would take an extraordinary care of the preſervation, as well of the perſons as goods of every particular, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

no other deſigne but to procure repoſe and liberty to the whole Kingdom, and that my great endeavour ſhould be to reduce things to order, which I hoped very ſhortly to effect; they returned me infinite thanks with promiſes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an eternal memory: Little elſe conſiderable happ'ning in my <hi>Cavalcade,</hi> I ſhall omit many ſmall particulars, and mention onely three things wothy to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>The firſt, that <hi>Gennaro</hi> began to ſhew himſelf diſcontented, that in all the publick exclamations, which were exceſſive, I onely was named without any mention of him, all endeavouring to expreſs as much indifference and contempt for him, as affection and reſpect for me, ſuppoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by my preſence ſecured from his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages. The ſecond, that at my paſſage through the Streets the houſes were all hung with tapeſtry, and the women at the windows who continually caſt into the Street, Flowers, ſweet Waters, and Comfits, accompanying thoſe teſtimonies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and joy with a thouſand Benedictions; The third, that the people came out of their houſes to ſpread their Cloaks and Tapeſtry under my horſes feet; and the women with perfuming Pots, the poorer ſort on tiles, burning incenſe; with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proteſtations they had no more fear ſince I was come to their aſſiſtance, and that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging me the author of their Liberty, they were reſolved to live and die with me, and to ſacrifice their lives and fortunes to my intereſt; Theſe demonſtrations of affection were in the ſame manner, with the ſame ceremonie and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57207:73"/>
paſſion continued to the day of my impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>By that time I had rid round the Town and viſited all the quarters, it was very late, and I went to dine with <hi>Gennaro,</hi> who treated me as ill as the day before. When I came to the <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> tower I found the Chamberlain of Cardinal <hi>Filomarini</hi> to complement me in his maſters name with excuſes, that ſome indiſpoſition had hindered his viſiting me, as ſoon as he heard of my arrival, and to deſire audience in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. Willing to prevent him, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner, I took a Sedan of Blew Velvet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Silver, which had belonged to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Matalone,</hi> which <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s wife made uſe of, and went to the Archbiſhops Palace, where I found in the Court all the domeſticks of Cardinal <hi>Filomarini,</hi> with the beſt qualified Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the Town, who came to receive me, he himſelf expecting me at the top of the Stairs; Taking me by the hand he led me into a very fair appartement, where we ſate down, and all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving avoided the room, and left us alone, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in private Conference an hour and half. Several Complements having paſſed on each ſide, he expreſſed a great affection for the people, whoſe liberty he hoped by the powerful prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>France,</hi> and infinitely extolled my zeal for coming to venture my life in ſo juſt a cauſe; That there could not be a ſufficient value put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my reſolution, which had contemned ſo many dangers as I was to undergo, and attempted ſo hazardous a paſſage. He repeated all that had
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57207:74"/>
happened from the beginning of the Revolutions, and blaming the <hi>Spaniards</hi> conduct, ſaid, he firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed Heaven would deliver ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and famous a Kingdom as that of <hi>Naples</hi> from the oppreſſion it had hitherto languiſhed under, and which could be no longer continued without its final ruine; That I was the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made uſe of for finiſhing a work ſo great and pious. That he, having ever had a true fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection for the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> people, thought himſelf very much concerned in their obligation to me, for undertaking their defence, offering me the aſſiſtance of his Prayers, and what-ever elſe depended on his credit, induſtrie or care. I thanked him for theſe ſo obliging diſcourſes, but underſtanding them to have more of diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than reality, reſolved to engage him ere he was aware to render himſelf irreconcileable to <hi>Spain,</hi> and conſequently to a neceſſity of making a near alliance with me: The good parts I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in him, his wit and prudence obliging me to deſire it. I agreed with him that I ſhould the next day take the oath of Fidelity to the people in the great Church, ſwearing to ſerve them with the peril of my life againſt all the World according to the Orders I had received from the King; and engaged him (though he would very fain have avoided it) to conſecrate the ſword the people was to preſent me for their defence, as a mark of authority, and of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute command they gave me over their Forces, which I accepted, and they had put into my hands. This Ceremonie was very inſignificant,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57207:74"/>
excepting in order to the deſign I had to embroil this Cardinal with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who indeed, never forgave him. Being very ſubtle, he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered my intention, but after an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate conteſtation he was forced to comply, having proteſted that without his Benediction I would not accept the Command, and that he muſt be reſponſible to the people for my refuſal, to whom it more imported that the oath I was to make to them ſhould be publick, and that my Word and Faith ſhould be depoſited with him.</p>
            <p>I took leave when we had agree'd according to my deſires, and he brought me to my Sedan, where after many reciprocal Teſtimonies of eſteem and friendſhip, I went towards the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites</hi> tower followed by the Captains <hi>Onoffri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I was willing alſo to ſee whether the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments between the Market-place and the Concheria were ſlighted according to my Orders in the Morning: which having done I returned to the <hi>Carmelites</hi> tower where I found <hi>Gennaro</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:57207:75"/>
very buſie, in putting Manacles and Fetters on the hands and feet of <hi>Lewis del Ferro,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Printed and Poſted up certain Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without his permiſſion: I would have beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Pardon, but what entreaties ſoever I could make, it would not be granted, till he ſhould have been eight and fourty houres Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the Cellar, <hi>Gennaro</hi> telling me that without ſuch frequent Chaſtiſements, it was impoſsible to prevent his extravagancies.</p>
            <p>Having been a Witneſs of this worthy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as I returned to the Hall I had notice that the Cardinal was coming to viſit me; I went to meet him, and we continued halfe an hour in private Diſcourſe, and he being troubled at what had been reſolved at our laſt enterview, endeavoured to alter me, but I perſiſting and alledging the ſame Reaſons, he durſt no longer contradict them, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way very ſollicitous how his excuſes would be received by the Vice-roy, which in the Night he ſent him by a Gentleman, who brought back Word, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him, and highly complained; that by what he was to do on the morrow, he would eſtabliſh my Reputation, and be inſtrumental to a confidence between me and the People. As ſoon as he was gone I ſupt and went to Bed, with the ſame diſguſt, and in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the day before.</p>
            <p>At my riſing on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning I was not a little joyful to ſee all thoſe that had embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued with me arrived in ſafety, not any
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57207:75"/>
of the <hi>Felucca's</hi> or <hi>Brigantines</hi> of my little Fleet miſcarrying, who, after having been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd in vain by the Enemies Gallies, after vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fortunes, and many conſiderable Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, came happily aſhore, ſome in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the reſt late in the night, though every one of them had ſteered a ſeveral courſe. Our meeting was an extraordinary ſatisfaction to all (having received no newes of each other till then) to be freed from the apprehenſions we were in four dayes together. All things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a readineſs for our going to Church, I gave notice to the Cardinal that I was taking Horſe to that purpoſe; The Houſes were hung with Tapiſtry, and a Guard of the Cittizens drawn out on each ſide the way, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at the Windows, all that were in the Town of either Sex aſſiſting, and taking pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſee my paſſage; <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s Guards march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt, and after them the Trumpets, followed by a Perſon choſen by <hi>Gennaro,</hi> who carried in a Scabbard the Sword that was to be Conſecrated, and put into my hands.

            <p>Having paſſed in this order from the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites</hi>-Tower to the great Church, with the loud Applauſes of all the People, and all teſtimonies of Affection, Reſpect, and Joy imaginable. I
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57207:76"/>
alighted, and was met by Cardinal <hi>Filomari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> at the head of his Clergy; who, after a Complement of the Obligations the City had to me for coming to undertake its defence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me into the Churches Treaſury, where he preſented me the Head of Saint <hi>Gennaro</hi> the Patron of <hi>Naplès</hi>; and let me ſee (not without Admiration) the continued Miracle of his Blood, which preſerved in a Viol, diſſolves at the approach of his Head, and as ſoon as ſeparated from it congeales again; this I then ſaw, and many times ſince, not without aſtoniſhment: from thence I went and took my place with <hi>Gennaro,</hi> on a Carpet ſpread before the High-Altar: and the Cardinal having on his Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Habit, and being ſeated in his Archiepiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Chair, <hi>Gennaro</hi> kneeling before him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him the Sword that was to be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which he drew, and after ſuch Ceremonies as the Church uſually practiſes in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of Armes, (<hi>Gennaro</hi> holding it up na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, to make it appear that the Peoples Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity reſided in him, as well in Civil as Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Affaires, and ſtanding on his right-hand) the Maſter of the Ceremonies came and conducted me to the Cardinals feet, who preſented me the forme of the Oath I was to make to the <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans,</hi> to ſerve them, my ſelf and Succeſſors, with our lives, againſt all the World, and not to lay down Armes till we had delivered them from ſlavery, by acquiring them liberty and repoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all which I pronounced aloud, laying
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57207:76"/>
my right hand on the <hi>New Teſtament</hi>; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a diſcourſe the <hi>Cardinal</hi> made me, of what Obligations my Oath bound me to, <hi>Gennaro</hi> preſented him the Sword, which he put into my hands, telling me, it was given me for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Naples,</hi> to oppoſe the violence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their Enemies would oppreſs them, and to break the fetters under whoſe weight they had ſo long groaned. He concluded, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming me Generalliſſimo of the Peoples For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Protector of their Liberties, which was followed by the Acclamations and Applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all that were preſent, who, making the Church Eccho it, carried the newes to the whole City, whoſe Inhabitants that were in Armes, teſtified their ſatisfaction by a great <hi>Volley,</hi> to which all the Artillery anſwered, this being the onely time it was fired during my aboad for want of <hi>Powder. Te Deum</hi> was afterwards Sung in Muſick, and having made one Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to the Cardinal, and another to the High Altar, I return'd to my place with the Sword in my hand, and delivered it to be held by me, by him that brought it. <hi>Maſs</hi> was Pontifically Celebrated, and when I roſe at the Reading of the Goſpel, it was again preſented me, as long as which laſted I held it up, in token of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the 0ath I had taken.</p>
            <p>All Ceremonies finiſhed, I returned to the <hi>Carmelites</hi>-Tower in the ſame manner I came from thence; excepting that the <hi>Sword</hi> was carryed naked before me, and <hi>Gennaro</hi> gave me the right-hand, and all publick Acclamations
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57207:77"/>
were redoubled. Every body went to Dinner, and <hi>Gennaro</hi> gave me one after the uſual manner. I gave order for the Magiſtrates of the Town, and all Captains and Officers, with the Council to meet in the Evening, who had beſought me to aſſign them an hour to congratulate with me, and conferre of all things neceſſarie for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Naples,</hi> and ſupplying its wants. After I had been to return thanks to Cardinal <hi>Filomarini</hi> for the pains he had taken, I viſited all the Poſts that had been fortified againſt-the enemy, and appointed the next Morning a general review of ail the Forces. From thence I went to ſee the Magazines, and took a particular account of what Ammunition and Proviſions were in the Town. Part of the day thus imployed, perceiving it late I retired to hold Council, and be readie at the hour I had appointed to all ſuch perſons as I had to do with.</p>
            <p>The firſt audience I gave to the Magiſtrates of the Town, whoſe complements I received, the Speech (for want of an Elect of the people, to which none had been nominated ſince <hi>Cicio Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paia</hi> abſented himſelf (and whoſe Office is much the ſame with that of Mayor of a Town) was made by the eldeſt of the City Captains. For anſwer I proteſted unto them that I would lay down my life for their concernments, and that I would never abuſe the authority they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, with which I held my ſelf to be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honored: and laſtly, conſulting with them by what means we might get in Proviſions, and re-eſtabliſh plenty; They told me that of Wine
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57207:77"/>
there was ſo great a quantity, that it was ſold for a Piſtol the Tun: That Butchers meat and ſalted meats were ſo farr from augmenting in price that they were fallen lower, and that in a long while no want could be of them, no more than of Poultry, and all other ſort of Victual, which would come in abundantly, as ſoon as the Countrey ſhould have knowledge that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their Forces; and that this would oblige all of them to declare: That the onely thing that was wanting, though indeed the moſt neceſſarie, was Corn, of which ſome quantity might be had, if the Stock deſigned for buying it had not been waſted: I offered them two thouſand Piſtols for their aſſiſtance in ſo preſſing a neceſſity, which I cauſed to be immediately delivered out of the Money I brought with me, till I could ſupply them with more conſiderable ſummes, or till I ſhould have forced open a paſſage whereby to receive Proviſions from abroad. We concluded that Bread ſhould be ſold ſomething dearer than the Corn coſt us, by that ſmall profit to increaſe the Stock I gave them, and that it was better to forbear leſſening the price of it at preſent, than to be afterwards obliged to raiſe it. In the mean time our Felucca's plentifully furniſhed us with fiſh, and all manner of herbs, fruits, and roots, on which the greateſt part of the Inhabitants uſually feed.</p>
            <p>The chief of the Army came afterwards to make their Complements, and having given them order to bring the next Morning at my riſing the names of all Officers, and a Roll of ſuch perſons

as were in arms in the Town, of whom I intended to take a review, they told me that powder was wanting on all their Poſts, not having where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to defend them ſhould the <hi>Spaniards</hi> make any attack that night. I inſtantly ordered ſome to be delivered, and commanded <hi>Amello Falco</hi> General of the Artillery to cauſe two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand weight to be ſent to <hi>Gennaro</hi> for defence of the tower, and the reſt to be carefully laid up, to give me an exact account, and deliver none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order under my hand, the little remainder obliging me to ſo cautious a management.</p>
            <p>Having diſmiſſed the Officers, I ſent for the Counſel, and having received and anſwered their Complements on the ſame Subject in the ſame manner, we ſate down to deliberate on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique affairs. <hi>Gennaro</hi> took his place next me, whoſe perpetual diſquiet obliged him to inceſſant riſings up to receive advice of ſome plunder was to be made, or to lay up ſuch as was brought in. He perceived us incommoded by this, (it being neceſſary to begin again all diſcourſes that every moment were interrupted) and deſired me not to mind him, his preſence being little neceſſarie, and that he complied with whatever we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve. Our beginning was the limiting his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and mine, and it was concluded that I ſhould abſolutely diſpoſe of all that related to war, and that the Officers and Souldiers ſhould have no dependance but on me alone. That he ſhould take upon him the civil Government, yet not to act any thing without advice of the Council, which ſhould be aſſembled on all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57207:78"/>
of occurrences, where I ſhould ſit Preſident, and hold the firſt place; That in caſe of my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence I ſhould receive Advertiſement of all Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations, which ſhould not be executed without my aſſent and participation. That his power in the Town, having never been owned by the reſt of the Kingdom, ſhould extend no farther; And that all Declarations, Manifeſts, and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſhould be ſent into the Provinces, ſhould be made and publiſhed in my name onely.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, it was reſolved that all Militarie Officers ſhould take new Commiſſions from me, and (the extreme want of Proviſions conſidered) that I ſhould be beſought to draw out the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt force could poſſibly be made both of Horſe and Foot, to attempt the regaining of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, of which the greater part were poſſeſſed by the Enemies, to make my ſelf Maſter of the Field, oblige the Countrey to declare for us, and open the Paſſages which were blocked up, ſo to have Communication with the reſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and principally with thoſe Provinces from which the City had wont to derive its ſubſiſtence; And when I repreſented that Levies in order to this could not be made without Money, and enquired from whence we might draw ſuch ſummes as ſhould be neceſſary, <hi>Gennaro</hi> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to furniſh us, the publike Treaſurie being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; Upon his refuſal I offered to make this expence, as farr as the little Stock I had brought with me would extend. They told me I ſhould find Arms ſufficient in the City, cauſing ſearch to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57207:79"/>
be made amongſt the Inhabitants, the meaneſt of whom had wherewithal to arm four or five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And it being repreſented that thoſe that kept Guard at the ſeveral Poſts (though with convenience enough, becauſe every one was in his own quarter) tired with this duty which they thought inſupportable, becauſe it laſted ſo long, would no more perform it without pay, it was reſolved to ſeek all expedients for a remedie, and that all ſuch as had any advice to give me in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it ſhould be heard; and that in the mean time I would not be wanting my Self to conſider of it, that ſo we might avoid the miſchief threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us by the cooling of the old hatred againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> now no longer expreſſed but in words, that ſo every one might do his utmoſt for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his liberty, eſtate, life and honour.</p>
            <p>I was alſo beſought to ſend a Manifeſt through the whole Kingdom, to declare that I came to <hi>Naples</hi> with no other intent than to procure li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and drive away the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance I brought of the powerful aſſiſtance of <hi>France,</hi> which would very ſuddenly ſend a potent Fleet, with all neceſſary ſupplies, and which, to avoid giving jealouſie, ſhould land no Forces but ſuch as were demanded, the King having no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to invade the Kingdom, or make himſelf its Maſter, but onely to deliver it from oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; it having ever been the cuſtom of <hi>France</hi> to aſſiſt without intereſt all ſuch as groaning under Tyranny have recourſe to her (this being of the higheſt conſequence to remove the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> maliciouſly infuſed into the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57207:79"/>
minds as well of the Nobility as People of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> naturally enemies to all forein dominion) and that of this no certainer teſtimony could be required than my Order to come amongſt them, and engage my ſelf in their ſervice by ſo ſolemn an Oath, which diſcharging me of all other Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, as nearly concerns me in their intereſts as if I had been born in their Countrey. They told me afterwards, that in order to my greater Authority, and to open a way for ſuch of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility as were willing to re-unite with them, by knowledge of ſome one to whom they might apply themſelves, (their vanity not ſuffering them to make any Addreſſes to <hi>Gennaro,</hi> becauſe of the meanneſs of his Birth) henceforward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and Graces ſhould be diſpenſed by me alone. Some of the moſt violent exclaimed at the word Nobility, and ſaid, they ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate them all, that it was they poſſeſſed the Countrey and cut off their Proviſions, who after having on all occaſions joyned with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> to oppreſs them, had now taken arms in order to their final ruine, that but two days ago had routed their Forces, and cauſed many families to wear Mourning for the loſs of their Relations, and particularly that the Prince of <hi>Monteſarchio</hi> had cut off their Water. Upon this diſcourſe <hi>Gennaro</hi> taking his place, propounded to go to the Cloyſter, where were four of his Siſters, and cut off their heads to ſend him as a token, or at leaſt (to be revenged on him) cauſe them to be raviſhed, and abandoned to the Skum of the people. I replyed, that was not the way to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57207:80"/>
recover the water he had deprived us of, but that I would take upon me to give him notice of the danger from which I had ſecured his Siſters, which peradventure my authority might another time come ſhort of, and that all was to be feared from an exaſperated people, whom he ought not to drive to deſpair, and that giving alarm in the Cloyſter of what theſe poor Ladies were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, they would gladly make uſe of all their credit with him, for the obtaining that which we demanded, on which depended their Lives and Honours, which he could not refuſe had he the leaſt affection and kindneſs for them.</p>
            <p>This advice was generally approved, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſuch ſucceſs as I expected; and for what concerned their great hatred for the Nobility, I gave them to underſtand that it having no other foundation than the miſchiefs already received, and which for the future they apprehended from them, to pretend to ruine, and maſſacre them as irreconcileable enemies, was to engage them to worſe, and re-unite them inſeparably with <hi>Spain,</hi> who without their aſſiſtance was not in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do us much hurt, ſince it was the Nobility were Maſters of the Field, and that cut off our Proviſions; if we could therefore once ſeparate them from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> intereſts and engage them in ours, the whole Kingdom would declare for us, After which it would be eaſie for us blocking up the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their Caſtles to ſtarve and force them to yield: and that ſo in a ſhort time we ſhould arrive at the height of our wiſhes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered from all forein power, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57207:80"/>
to form our Republique, and raiſe it up to be as conſiderable and potent as that of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All yielded to my Reaſons, and conjured me to labour in ſo important a deſign, and to this purpoſe to ſend for all ſuch Gentlemen as were in Town, to give them aſſurance of my good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and order them to give notice of them to the reſt of the Nobility. I would not make any expreſſions of my joy, for having obtained ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a point towards the Publique ſafety, and my own particular, leſt I ſhould render my ſelf liable to the peoples jealouſie, who (ever inclined to the worſer ſide) deſire that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to themſelves, and concealing my ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, replied, that underſtanding the natural vanitie of the chief of their Nobility, I knew they would become inſolent if they found themſelves ſought to, and looking on themſelves as too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, imagine we could not ſubſiſt without them, which would cauſe them to exact from us inſupportable conditions: but if they thought fit, I would let them know that but for me, their eſtates, perſons, and families were in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual danger, and that I would ſtill continue my endeavours for their preſervation; That if they thought good to joyn with us, I aſſured them they ſhould find in our Republique conditions worthy their Birth. That the common intereſt of their Countrey obliged them to this concurrence for driving away the common enemy. That they as well as the people wore Chains which were to be broken, and that when ever they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57207:81"/>
ſhould take ſo good a reſolution, they ſhould find me ready with open armes to receive them, and ſacrifice my Life for their Intereſts, which Honour, Reaſon and love of their Countrey, ought to render inſeparable from thoſe of the People.</p>
            <p>The Managing this Important Affair was left to my diſcretion, and the Council riſing, every Man retired, and having ſupped ill and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, I went to make a diſpatch, to give the Court, and the Kings Miniſters at <hi>Rome</hi> advice of my arrival at <hi>Naples,</hi> and all that paſſed ſince, and having furniſhed the ſame Felucca that brought me, favoured by the night, I ſent a ſervant called <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to ſupply the omiſſons might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in my letters, and to give an exact account of all things whereof he had been an eye-witneſs.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Fontenay</hi> had been ſo ſtrongly prepoſſeſt by the Fabulous Relations made him, of the Forces of the People of <hi>Naples,</hi> that (ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining there was no want, either of Victualls, Ammunition, Mony, or Men, but onely of a Head that with Authority, giving remedy to their Confuſions, after an eſtabliſhment of ſome Order, might make a profitable uſe of all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages) He had encharged me to draw out five or ſix thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe, to open a paſſage, and make a free cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Naples:</hi> I thought it neceſſary (by making him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the true condition of Affaires) to let him ſee the impoſſibility of executing ſo great a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57207:81"/>
Deſign, being ſo farr from it, that I was at the point of ruin, unleſs powerfully and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuccored; which obliged me to write him my wants more at large, that being ſenſible of them he might become my Sollicitor. But (whether it were that he credited more the Chimerical diſcourſes of ſome <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> or that he was ill affected towards me, the cauſe whereof I know not, or out of deſire to appear conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, by ſeeming better informed at <hi>Rome</hi> of what paſſed at <hi>Naples,</hi> then I that was upon the place; or that flattering himſelf in ſome ſecret intelligences and negotiations with perſons (though without his knowledge) employed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who decried my conduct, and gave him jealouſie of the credit I daily acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or imagining that any other might have done what I did, and perhaps more; and that I owed my Authority leſs to my own addreſs and care, then to the irreconcileable hatred the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> bore the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> on which though on a deceitful bottom, he grounded great hopes of rendering himſelf neceſſary) he began to complain of me, as if, to avoid dependance, and ſuch orders as I might too frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, I would not (by opening a paſſage) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh a more eaſie correſpondence betwixt us: and, without excuſing me, on account of the difficulties of Navigation in ſo tempeſtuous a ſeaſon, and the obſtruction of the paſſage of <hi>Felucca</hi>'s, by a Fleet compoſed of ſo many Ships, Gallies, and ſmall Veſſels with Ores, which I ſometimes vainly attempted ten dayes together,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57207:82"/>
accuſed me for not writing to him, though I omitted no opportunity, unleſs in ſuch inſtants in which only I could gain advantages, or ſome enterpriſes of war, or my abſence from Town prevented me. He detained all my diſpatches for the Court that came to his hands, all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Letters that were ſent me, in ſo much, that in five Moneths I never could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any other, hut ſuch as were brought me by ſome of my domeſticks. He gave informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to my prejudice, which I perceived at the arrival of the Fleet, by the jealouſie had of me, and the endeavours to deprive me of all credit, and prevent my performing (which I could have done without difficulty) Actions ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and advantagious to the Crown, induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Crying me down as a Perſon Chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, that ſuffering my ſelf to be blindly tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Ambition, ſought nothing but my own eſtabliſhment, imagining to ſubſiſt on my own bottom, and to ſtand in need neither of Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor ſupplies. He endeavoured in the ſame manner to poſſeſs the moſt Factious perſons in <hi>Naples,</hi> that he might render me odious. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a correſpondence with <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and in a word ſought my ruin by all manner of wayes, as if I had been the greateſt Enemy of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe intrigues I quickly diſcovered; for the greateſt part of the Meſſengers he employed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soldiers of the Garriſon of <hi>Piombino,</hi> and <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and conſequently having greater kindneſs for me than him, liſted themſelves in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57207:82"/>
the Troops I levied, and bringing me their packets, delivered them not till I had opened and ſealed them again. On the other ſide, I had taken care to win all perſons that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Gennaro,</hi> even his wife, who ſometimes furniſhed me with part of his Mony, of whom I ſhould have obtained conſiderable ſumms, had he not perceived the loſs, though he could not gueſs by whom it was taken; and ſince he could not read, there being a neceſſity he ſhould truſt ſome body, they who peruſed his Letters, gave me an inſtant account of them; By ſuch lights it was eaſie to direct my reſolutions.</p>
            <p>Though this day would have ſeemed toilſome to another, it was agreeable to me, becauſe I had employed it profitably, and in ſo ſhort a time advanced Affaires, I reaſonably thought might have proved the worke of ſome weeks: ſo that not ſtaying for Supper, which deſerv'd it not, I went to Bed, as well to repoſe, as at my eaſe to recollect what I had done, and was to do the day following, where I had found great content, had it not been for the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Company I was forced to endure. I put <hi>Gennaro</hi> in mind of his Promiſe, to give liberty to <hi>Lewis del Ferro,</hi> which he told me ſhould be done in the morning, and afterwards bidding him good-night, feigned my ſelf very drowſie, to avoid ſo unſatisfactory and irrational an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
            <p>The next morning, Monday the eighteenth of <hi>November,</hi> I aroſe very early, and went to the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57207:83"/>
               <hi>Carmelites,</hi> there at leiſure to conferr with ſuch Officers as I had appointed to meet me. They informed me of the number and importance of the Poſtes (beſides the 3 Caſtles) that were poſſeſſed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Town, what Regiments they had, as well of their own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> what Horſe, and how diſpoſed of; the names of their General Officers and Colonels, the manner of their keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Guard; what particular Officers Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every quarter, and generally of all things I was concerned to know. Afterwards they told me, That we could make ſtate of no more than three thouſand and five hundred Foot, and two hundred, or two hundred and fifty Horſe, the reſt having been ruin'd in a fight againſt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility the day of my arrival; but that in caſe of extraordinary neceſſity, I might liſt what I plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the People being all Armed, and ready for a ſudden Exploit, provided the occaſion laſted not long. They gave me the Names of the Colonels, Serjeant-Majors, and Captains, that had the Guard of the Quarters, or advanced Poſtes, who being to take new Commiſſions from me, were not backward in bringing in their Memorials. <hi>I</hi> enquired alſo after the moſt intelligent and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable perſons, to employ in making my Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, and reſolved not to loſe this Morning which I had deſigned for taking a review of all the Forces, and of all the Streets we had entrenched againſt the Enemy; to remedy what I ſhould find amiſs, and ſecure our ſelves better: Being ready to take Horſe, I was told
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57207:83"/>
the Council was aſſembled at <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s. This being contrary to the reſolution had been taken, that I ſhould be alwayes Preſident of ſuch as ſhould be held whil'ſt I was in Town, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted thither to enquire the reaſon of ſuch a Novelty, which was, that the Sieur <hi>de Ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantes</hi> had procur'd it, to give account (as he ſaid) of a Commiſſion ſent him by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Fontenay,</hi> and preſent his Letters of Credence. After his offers to the Council of the Kings Protection and aſſiſtance, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to blame my ſlackneſs, for not having attempted to open a paſſage for bringing in proviſions; and told them, That had be been in my place, they ſhould have come in abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He vaunted his former Employments, and wanting neither wit nor eloquence, had almoſt perſwaded thoſe that heard him, that he was as great a Captain, as <hi>Marquis Spinola,</hi> or the Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> impudently concluding that he was Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> and that as ſuch he participated of her truſt and ſecrets, and that himſelf alone was encharged with her Orders: pretending by this Artifice to make himſelf Camp-Maſter-General, (and to neceſſitate me not to refuſe it, having <hi>Gennaro,</hi> the Council, and People on his ſide) which he knew he ſhould never obtain from me, that looked on him as too unworthy in Birth, merit and experience for an Employment I reſerved to invite to us ſome one of the greateſt Nobility in the Kingdom, that had been a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and whoſe quality and capacity might be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57207:84"/>
more uſeful and creditable to me. <hi>Ceriſantes</hi> was the Son of a Preacher of <hi>Saumur</hi>; and the Marquis of <hi>Fors,</hi> whoſe Tutor he had been, made him Lieutenant to the Colonels Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in the Regiment of <hi>Navarre,</hi> after whoſe death he left the Employment; He had Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but was moſt extravagantly vain. A difference he had, impertinently enough, in the beginning of the Queens Regency, with Monſieur <hi>de Candal</hi> obliged him to leave the Kingdom, and go for <hi>Sweden</hi>; where Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a value for Men of parts, had ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration for him, becauſe of the excellent Latine Verſes he made, in which few of this age equalize him; having obtained of her a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for a Regiment which was never raiſed, he returned into <hi>France</hi> with the quality of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel and her Agent: but ſhe having learned how little he was eſteemed, and her ſelf on his account in ſome manner ſlighted, diſcharged him. Preſently after this he went for <hi>Rome,</hi> and giving out that his diſmiſſion happened on no other account, but the intention was diſcovered in him of changing his Religion, he ſought a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and having abjured his former belief, and daily preſenting as well to him as to the chiefeſt and ableſt of the Cardinals, excellent Latine Compoſitions, put himſelf in a poſture of pretending to ſome favour. He often viſited <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay,</hi> and made his regular Court to me, that we might do him good Offices. In this condition he was at the time of my paſſing to <hi>Naples,</hi> and when I deſired of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57207:84"/>
Ambaſſadour ſome one to keep the <hi>Ciphers</hi> (having then no <hi>French</hi> Secretarie) he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this man to me for want of another ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch an employment. The eaſineſs he diſcovered in the Kings Miniſters qualifying <hi>Lewis del Ferro</hi> with the title of Ambaſſadour, perſwaded him, that he meriting it more than the other, could not be refuſed it, eſpecially if it appeared he had gained credit enough to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome cloſe intrique, and work my ruine, which perhaps he had diſcovered they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of. I had been told too that in his paſſage from <hi>Rome,</hi> he let ſlip, to the <hi>Sieur D'orillac,</hi> a Gentleman belonging to me, (who reaſonably enough feared I might be taken Priſoner, having heard no news from me:) that though ſuch a misfortune had happened, the Kings ſervice ſhould ſuffer little by it, himſelf alone being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſupporting the weight of the <hi>Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> affairs, how embroiled ſoever, till the arrival of the Fleet.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe held with one of my Domeſticks ſufficiently diſcovers the judgement of the party. He was much ſurpriſed at my coming into the Council, where declaring that I took it very ill that they deliberated on any thing without my knowledge, they made many excuſes, that they could not refuſe receiving the Kings Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor hearing what his Ambaſſadour had to ſay to them. I ranted <hi>Ceriſantes</hi> for his inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in taking upon him that title, and threatned him with ſevere puniſhment, if in his life he any more committed ſuch a folly directly contrary to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57207:85"/>
the honour of the Crown, turning to ridiculous, in the eyes of all <hi>Europe,</hi> that character by which particular perſons repreſent Soveraigns.</p>
            <p>He went away in a great deal of Confuſion, yet he had ſo farre infatuated the whole Aſſembly by his plauſible diſcourſes, that with one conſent I was beſought to make choice of him for Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter general. This I refuſed, notwithſtanding all inſtances could be made, as of too great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to my Honour in all places where he was known: it being as important to me as to the people, to reſtrain ſuch incroachments, which would give our enemies too great advantages, and too many occaſions to contemn us. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I got on horſeback and went to make the review, which by this unexpected occaſion had been delayed: I had little ſatisfaction in it, finding (as hath been ſaid) but three thouſand and five hundred foot, and two hundred and fifty horſe, the greateſt part of whoſe Officers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw any other War than that which had been raiſed in their City ſince the firſt Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the Confuſion and Diſorder had been ſo great, that it were more ſignificant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards underſtanding the profeſſion, to forget than make uſe of what they had ſeen. I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited alſo all the Poſts that were fortified and entrenched, and though naturally I want not memory for reporting what I have ſeen, it will be impoſſible for me to recite it, the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo irregular and extraordinarie, that I muſt acknowledge I can make nothing of it. There were cuttings off at the end of every ſtreet that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57207:85"/>
fronted the enemies works. The trenches in ſome places were made of Faggots and Barrels filled with Earth, flanked onely by the houſes, in which ſometimes the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were poſſeſt of the Garrets and Cellars, and the people of the other Stories. In other places all was very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, Souldiers were placed behind Chimneys, and where the Streets were narrow, they were croſſed by Planks, which gave Communication from the Roofs of the Houſes, where for the moſt part the Gutters were made the fields of Battel. Onely the Cuſtom-houſe, the Gate of <hi>Albe,</hi> and two or three other Poſts were in a good condition, they having been accidently provided with ſome Officer that had ſerved in <hi>Flanders,</hi> at <hi>Milan</hi> or in <hi>Catalonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I recollect what I ſaw that Morning, I cannot but ſtill admire how the Town held out againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and am confident it muſt needs have been reduced before my arrival, had it not been either by reaſon of the incapacity of the greateſt part of their Officers, who obtain their Charges from the Viceroys before they have ſeen any thing, and are very ſuddenly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, by reforming many under pretence of giving them Penſions, and this in ſuch manner that in the time of the Duke of <hi>Medina de los torres</hi> one Company of foot in one day had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively ſeven Captains; or the want of reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Councils, or their fear of being over-powred by the multitude, or elſe that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Proviſions, they forbore to undertake any thing, till the Spring ſhould give them facility
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57207:86"/>
and ſecurity of Navigation, to bring them plenty, leſt they might be overcharged with too many mouths, and ſo conſume the little that remained for preſervation of their Caſtles. I added to theſe extravagant Fortifications whatever I could imagine uſeful, and made them ſecure againſt Surpriſes, unleſs by Treaſon.</p>
            <p>I began my Levies by a Company of three hundred Fowlers, who being the beſt markſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the World, I placed them on the tops of Houſes, in all the Garret windows, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Chimneys, but principally in the Steeple of the Cloyſter of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Sebastian,</hi> from whence diſcovering the backſide of the Gate of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Spirito</hi> (the moſt important of all the enemies quarters, and kept by <hi>Spaniards</hi>) they killed all Officers that went to and fro with Orders; at my hours of leiſure I went every day thither to enjoy this pleaſure, till the Canon of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Elmos</hi> Caſtle drove me away; One day <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Ognate,</hi> paſſing in Sedans, the men that carried them were killed, and they forced to make haſte to ſave themſelves afoot. Theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert fellows did them infinite miſchief, and in five moneths time knocked down an incredible number of their Officers.</p>
            <p>I gave out Commiſſions for five Regiments, of which I gave one to <hi>Sieur Perez</hi> (who had ſerved in <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and been hurt at the defence of the Cuſtom-houſe, which he kept with a great deal of honour) and who is yet with me, the others to <hi>Sieur Caſtaldo, Sieur Antonio de Calco</hi> who had been Lieutenant of the Camp-maſter
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57207:86"/>
General in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſervice, <hi>Sieur Juan Dominico</hi> an old Souldier, and to <hi>Pepe Palombe.</hi> I made one alſo of Dragoons, which having but two Companies raiſed, I gave their command to <hi>Marco Piſano.</hi> I raiſed alſo one hundred guards and three troops of horſe, all at my own expence, and appointed <hi>Onofrio Piſacani, Carlo Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardo,</hi> and <hi>Cicio Batimiello,</hi> perſons in whom I confided, to ſearch what arms were in all the houſes, and to give me account on the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place at three a clock where I would expect them. Being told of a diſorder about the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairie I haſted thither, and found <hi>Lewis del Ferro</hi> followed by Boys and others of the Raſcalitie he had drawn together, who, having brought Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, were with Chiſſels breaking down the Arms of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, which ſtood over the Gate: The people that had an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary reſpect for his memory were in a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, which I appeaſed by cauſing him to be clapt into a dungeon in Irons. I commanded the arms to be ſet up anew, and on pain of death forbad the like inſolencies, or to drag the King of <hi>Spains</hi> picture through the Streets, or ſtab it with Knives; on which account I caſhiered the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lazares, reſerving onely the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Pione,</hi> who commanded it, and had been more obedient to my Orders than the reſt, and had not only accompanied <hi>Maſaniello</hi> in the firſt revolt, but had taken the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> by the Beard; I cauſed two ſuch Raſcals to be whipt whom I found tearing with hooks the pour-traiture of the Catholike King, being of opinion
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57207:87"/>
that how fierce a war ſoever we make, we are not to forget a reſpect to Majeſty, which ought to be always ſacred.</p>
            <p>I am not inſenſible that ill offices were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be done me at Court on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though my proceedings cannot be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by perſons of Honour, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though they extremely hate our nation, not having demoliſhed that which in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Quarters of the City preſerves the memorie of the <hi>French</hi> Government.</p>
            <p>Preſently after Dinner I went to the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place to expect account of my Orders, where I met a remarkable adventure, which tended to my greater authority and reſpect. They to whom I had given Commiſſion brought me account of ſuch Arms as they had found; but a Butcher cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Michael de Santis,</hi> a man ſeditious and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, accompanied by five and twenty or thirty perſons like himſelf, who were his ordinary fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, came rudely to complain to me, that he was not uſed with ſuch reſpect as belonged to him, the ſearch for Arms having been made in his houſe as well as amongſt the other Inhabitants; I told him it had been done by my Order, and that I underſtood not on what account he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be exempted. He told me he was Camp-Maſter General. I deſired to know how long he had been poſſeſſed of that charge, and who gave it him, and whether he had ever been a Souldier? He acknowledged he had not, and that he had no experience, but that he had taken that charge upon himſelf; that he would receive
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57207:87"/>
a Commiſſion from no man, and that this was the ſlighteſt recompence the important ſervices he had rendered the people merited, for having driven the Nobility out of the Town, whoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and perſecutor he had declared himſelf. I forbad him any longer to aſſume that Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which I reſerved for a Perſon of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and that he ſhould content himſelf with the command of his Quarter: Upon which anſwering me arrogantly and with too little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, I threatned that if he perſiſted, I would cauſe him immediately to be hanged on the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that was in the Market-place. Having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn into the middle of his rabble, where he thought himſelf ſafe, he began to grumble, that I had not been above two dayes in <hi>Naples</hi> and would already play the Maſter, and bragging, that he had cut off the head of Don <hi>Pepe Caraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa,</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Matalone,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Body to be dragged through the Streets, ſaid, he would uſe me in the ſame manner, if I too much vexed him: I was then upon a black <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, very vigorous, which I ſpurred right upon him, and trampled him under feet in the middle of his Company. Suppoſing one that uſed ſo little Ceremony, would certainly hang him, poſſeſt with fear, he got on his knees and begged his life, proteſting ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have all manner of ſubmiſſion and reſpect for me: I pardoned him, but with aſſurance, that if he ſhould ever be again ſo inſolent, I would make him an example. All that were preſent ſeemed ſurpriſed at this Action, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57207:88"/>
that I apprehended not the danger to which I might have expoſed my ſelf, to whom, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I anſwered, That I had a natural contempt for the rabble, and that when God framed a Perſon of my quality, he imprinted ſomething on his forehead, could not be beheld by it without trembling.</p>
            <p>Afterwards came an Apothecary to demand Juſtice of me, becauſe the Souldiers he had till then Commanded, weary of Obeying him, had on their own Authority made choice of another Captain. I gave them a great repriment, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to obey him as they had done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: And, in anſwer to ſome Complaints they made of his ill Conduct, he impudently told me they lied. I was in choler, and perceiving that by ſuffering ſuch things I ſhould every day fall from the reſpect due to me, gave him a blow on the head with my Cane, that laid him at my feet, which he kiſſed in acknowledgment of his fault, and fearing ſomething worſe, thought himſelf happy to ſcape ſo eaſily, and that he was very much beholding to my moderation: He ſerved me well and faithfully ever after, and his Souldiers obeyed him without having any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with him, which ſeemed very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to me.</p>
            <p>The moſt preſſing Affair that lay now upon me, being to provide for the ſubſiſtence of thoſe that guarded our Poſtes, who would no longer have fatigue without pay, having thought on a hundred expedients, I fixed on one, which ſeemed the moſt ready, and moſt ſure, which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57207:88"/>
was, to appoint the Mint-Maſter, and all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, to bring me to <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s a Furnace, to try whether their Money were of the true Allay. All things being ready for this purpoſe, I went, and diſcovering the abuſe, of which this ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple never fail, threatned to hang them as Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of falſe Money; which they, not without reaſon, apprehending, I was a long while inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the entreaties of all that ſpoke for them, and made them accept it as a great mercy, to puniſh them onely in the forfeiture of their Salaries and Profits to the Publick-uſe, for as long a time as I ſhould think good.</p>
            <p>The great quantity of Plate that had been Plundered from the firſt inſurrection of <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niello,</hi> which they that were Maſters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Mony, conſider'd, we found we might make Eſtate daily, (counting one day with another) of five hundred Crowns. I appointed this ſtock for paying the Forces I had in the Town, which not onely proved ſufficient, but ſerved for thoſe alſo, which from that day to the day of my Impriſonment, I maintained in the Field, with ſuch ſucceſs as you ſhall hereafter hear of.</p>
            <p>Unwilling to continue any longer uſeleſs, and without ſome action, whoſe ſplendor might gain me reputation, I cauſed an extraordinary draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, of two thouſand commanded Foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the beſt of all the Quarters, that I might make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the intelligence I had of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies negligence on two conſiderable Poſts, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Mortelles</hi> and St. <hi>Charles.</hi> Theſe thought
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57207:89"/>
themſelves very ſecure, becauſe covered by St. <hi>Elmos</hi> Caſtle, and <hi>Lantignana</hi> and the <hi>Vomero</hi> which are (as it were) two Suburbs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving till then held for them, but now had ſent to aſſure me, they would declare for me, and take Arms on my firſt Order. I ſent them one in Writing by Serjeant Major <hi>de la Cave,</hi> who commanded a Body of ſix hundred Men, drawn from a Town of the ſame name, whoſe Inhabitants have in all Ages had the reputation of the beſt and hardieſt Souldiers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; I would not go my ſelf towards that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, leſt I might give ſuſpition of my Deſign, of which the Enemies, by their Spies, might have received advertiſement.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as it was night, I headed my two thouſand men in the Market-place, ready to March when it ſhould be time. I deſigned two attaques, one near the Cuſtom-houſe, and the other by the Cloyſter of St. <hi>Clare,</hi> to buſie and divert their Forces, by apprehenſion that I was ready to ſecond either of them, where I ſhould ſee moſt facility, and appearance of ſucceſs. The <hi>Cavaioli</hi> or men of <hi>la Cava</hi> were in the interim drawn near St. <hi>Charles,</hi> to fall on as ſoon as I ſhould give the Signal, which was a Musket three times fired; five hundred Muſqueteers of <hi>Vomero</hi> and <hi>Lantigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> were to ſecond them, and I to be at the ſame time at the head of my two thouſand men, to force the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from all they were poſſeſt of in the Town, except the Caſtles; Theſe two Poſts, when gained, playing on their rear,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57207:89"/>
and cutting off all their other quarters; which was not difficult to effect, the incapacity of the greateſt part of their Officers conſidered, and the aſtoniſhment and confuſion that would be amongſt them at ſuch a ſurprizal. A hundred men were to fall on firſt, and (ſeconded by the like number) to advance farther as ſoon as the Work they had ſtormed ſhould be poſſeſt, and in a condition to ſecure them from being cut off; the ſame thing was afterwards to be done from Poſte to Poſte: and thus, without any great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of Men, I might have ſucceeded in ſo handſome an enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>The ſignal was to be given at four in the morning, and I expecting the time with much impatience, that of my Men was ſo much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that they began the attaque two houres ſooner, before thoſe that ſhould have ſeconded them were come up, or I knew how to bring them ſuccor. The great firing I heard, ſoon gave me notice of their precipitation, I loſt no time in beginning my March, which I had but juſt done, when I had newes by an Officer, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to me in all haſte, that St. <hi>Charles</hi> was ſtormed, with the Death or Impriſonment of five and thirty Reformadoes that kept it. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of this good ſucceſs gave me a great deal of Joy, which was too much allay'd a quarter of an hour after, when I underſtood that my men, two farr tranſported, by the little oppoſition they met, going on without minding whether they were ſeconded or not, had taken
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57207:90"/>
the <hi>Morteles,</hi> and ſome other Fortified Poſtes, &amp; paſſed on to the <hi>Gardiole,</hi> and St. <hi>Annes</hi> Chappel, which are near the Vice-roys Palace, who was ſo ſurpriſed, that he abandoned it, and in all haſte made to the New Caſtle: Had my Orders been followed, ſo that I might have come timely in, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeemed driven out of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Caſtles accidentally being provided with no more then four and twenty houres Victuals, and their communication cut off. But, my men dazeled by their good fortune, fell to plunder, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter houſes; which, the Regiment of <hi>Naples</hi> perceiving, without reſiſtance re-poſſeſt the Poſtes we had gained, but diſorderly abandoned; and of three hundered men they took, they killed ſome, hanged ſeven or eight, and ſent the reſt a plentiful recruit to their Gallies.</p>
            <p>This ſenſibly touched me, and made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret the want of a Body of well-regulated Troops, who, having more obedience, would not have expoſed me to ſuch a diſpleaſure, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that we ought not to preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward till we have made our ſelves ſecure of our retreat. Vexed to the Soul by this misfortune, I reſolved not to retire, till I had attempted ſomething elſe; and to this purpoſe, having put ſuch Troops as I had with me in battalia, in the Piazza that is before Cardinal <hi>Filomarini</hi>'s Palace, I drew out two bodies, one to attaque a Work that had been advanc'd by the enemies, to the end of the Street that goes towards St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church, where they had lodged one of their moſt conſiderable bodies; the other to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57207:90"/>
to gain ground towards the bottom of <hi>Cedrangulo,</hi> where they were ſo advanced they might eaſily fall on our rear, in two or three of the moſt important places in which we were poſted.</p>
            <p>Theſe two attaques had ſucceſs, and ſeconding them often, I had the good luck to recover, in leſs then half an hour, in this laſt quarter, all the enemy had gained from the people in ſix weeks. Greater oppoſition was made about St. <hi>Maries</hi>; my Men were twice beaten back, and perceiving them fall from the vigour that firſt appear'd in them, I was forced to give them example; and followed by ſome of my own ſervants, and other private perſons, I charged the enemies ſo ſmartly with my Sword, that I drove them into the Cloyſter, and breaking through the Houſes, one after another, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a whole Street, and advanced a Trench within ten paces, though they had five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men in it. I order'd <hi>Ceriſantes</hi> to Poſte himſelf ſtrongly there, in doing which, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himſelf as gallantly as he had done at the attacque, and made it ſo defenſible, that I ever after kept it. After this I went to make place for the Cannon on the right and left hand of the neighbouring Workes, to flanke them, and lodge Musketiers; and having broke down a piece of a Wall, out of curioſity to obſerve the countenance of the Enemy, I received a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſhot below my left eye, which only razed the skin, and a little ſinged my hair, It was ſo favourable, that it ſignified nothing but to gain
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57207:91"/>
me credit and affection amongſt the People, all both Men and Women coming to ſee the mark of it, which remained eight or nine dayes, giving me a thouſand Benedictions, and conjuring me to a greater care of my ſelf, ſince loſing me they loſt all, on whom alone, next to God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended their repoſe and liberty.</p>
            <p>This little action, not ill managed, cauſed the bad ſucceſs of the morning to be forgotten; and ſeeing my Levies begin to come on, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved after a few dayes to take the field, to bring Proviſions into the Town, which neceſſity began to make murmur. All Towns and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges near the City, hearing that I commanded, had taken Armes for me, and were followed by all the Countrey (excepting ſuch places as had Garriſons) encouraged by the renown of my Perſon, and Authority of my Name as ſoon as they had heard of my arrival, and ſeen the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts I had carefully diſtributed to all parts; I ſent <hi>Jacomo Roſſo</hi> to draw together a thouſand Musketiers, and bring them to me as ſoon as I ſhould give Order, in quality of Colonel of ſuch Soldiers as ſhould be drawn out of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Villages, and employed eight or ten dayes in all things neceſſary for my taking the Field.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I made a Proclamation on pain of death againſt Plundering Houſes, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſearching for concealed Armes, Money, or other Moveables: and another, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any intelligence to give me of Treaſon, or other ſecret enterpriſes, might addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57207:91"/>
to me, with aſſurance to be well reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Accuſations, in caſe they could ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them; but otherwiſe, for want of prooffs, to be irremiſſibly puniſhed with the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties that belonged to the Crimes of which they were the informers. This was abſolutely neceſſary, for before I undertook the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was in the power of every Rogue to take away the life of the honeſteſt Man, <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro,</hi> without farther enquiry, cutting off the heads, and dragging the Bodies about the Streets of all ſuch as were but reported to hold correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with the Enemy, to contrive any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt the People or his Perſon: which kept all in a ſtrange confuſion, in a Countrey where hatreds are ſo violent, that he that hath an Enemy, muſt fear death at all times, without opportunity of ſpeaking for himſelf, and being heard in his Juſtifications.</p>
            <p>Applying my ſelf to all means of getting Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without which War cannot be made, till I could cauſe Salt-peter to be brought in from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, I went to the Powder-houſe in St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonies</hi> Suburbs, and commanded the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it to make uſe of the earth of all Stables, and other places where Salt-peter might be had, to ſpare none of them, nor the Labor of Men. Having done all that was poſſible, I could never get above four and forty, or five and forty pound a day, which I cauſed to be brought home to me, that it might be the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and none delivered without order under my hand, having perceived that <hi>Aniello
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57207:92"/>
Falco,</hi> General of the Artillery, and his Officers, made too great a profuſion.</p>
            <p>I was ſo weary of my ill entertainment and lodging at <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s, that I reſolved, till a Palace could be provided for me, to lodge at the <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> in an appartement reſerved for the General of their Order, and to be ſerved by mine own Officers, thinking it neither convenient nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to continue longer without houſe or equipage; and the patience I had for eight dayes being at an end, I told <hi>Gennaro</hi> my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, who uſed all means to diſſwade me, but in vain: ſo inviting him to Dine with me the next day, being the twenty ſecond of <hi>November,</hi> and bidding him goodnight, I went to my own lodging, to ſleep at my eaſe in a good bed provided for me; which I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done ſince my arrival at <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as I had left him he was advertiſed that at the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> was a Cheſt hid under a pair of Stairs, full of Mony and Jewels: his avarice obliged him to make haſte, and breaking down part of a Wall he perceived had been newly made up, found the Cheſt, but much to his diſcontent, filled with nothing but Chalices, and other Church-Ornaments. He ſuppoſed the Porter of the Cloyſter could give him notice of ſome other that contained more wealth, and took him home with him, and diverted himſelf the whole night in racking him with his own hand. In the morning he made me acquainted with it, and I gave him a very great Repriment, and obliged him to ſend him back with all the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57207:92"/>
booty he had made of Church-goods, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him ſo much with the puniſhment he ought to apprehend from Heaven, that being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally timorous, he promiſed no more to commit ſuch a fault.</p>
            <p>From thence we went to Maſſe together, where, having cauſed a Cuſhion to be laid for him near mine on the Carpet, I perceived ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laid on my left-hand, and demanding for whom, anſwer was made me for the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and <hi>Ceriſantes</hi> proffering to come and take that place, I ſent back the Cuſhion into the Veſtry, and told him, that if he would not become wiſer by the Leſſons I had given him, I would make him be ſhut up in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> not able to ſuffer the Honour of <hi>France,</hi> and my own Authority to be made ridiculous by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence and temerity, of which I ought to be very ſollicitous, the eyes of all Europe being fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me, to endeavour to diſcover in my Conduct any thing that might blemiſh the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſuch Actions, as I had attempted with ſo much paines and danger.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I reſolved to leave the Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> in <hi>Naples</hi> during my abſence, an underſtanding Man, and one I confided in, that he might obſerve all the motions of <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and give me notice of all ſhould be reſolved on, and endeavour with addreſs to manage Mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, ſo that all deliberations might anſwer my intention. He became acceptable to all the People, made himſelf eſteemed and beloved, and gained an aſcendant over the inclinations of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro.</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:57207:93"/>
He made uſe of all theſe advantages, to make himſelf Camp-maſter-General, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unable to ſuffer <hi>Ceriſantes</hi> to be preferred before him, or out of zeal to my Service, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf more capable of the employment, and ambitious of acquiring Honour, with his Sword in his hand, which render'd him uſeleſs in all. I had deſign'd him for, embroil'd him afterwards with me, and gave me a great deal of trouble.</p>
            <p>The People came in a Body with incredible ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations to recommend him, ſuppoſing it to be pleaſing to me to be importun'd to it: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thanks for the affection they teſtified for me, in placing ſo great confidence in one that had followed my Fortune, but that it was but reaſonable that I ſhould reſerve that place for ſome of their own Nation, ſince its honours and advantages might invite to us the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Nobility, whoſe Birth and parts might be very helpful to us; beſides, that ſo <hi>I</hi> ſhould deprive the Enemy of ſome eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe loſs would be as prejudicial to them, as his acquiſition advantageous to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> continnued firme in this intention, which <hi>I</hi> juſtified by Reaſons that admitted little reply, but he working under-hand, and perſwading them that compulſion would not be diſagreeable to me on this occaſion, <hi>I</hi> was extreamly ſurprized when in the afternoon he brought me his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for Camp-maſter-General, ſigned by <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and all the Captains of the Quarters, and heads of the People, who (he ſaid) forced

him to accept it, after his vain endeavours to be excuſed. <hi>I</hi> was troubled at this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, but, diſſembling my reſentments, told him, <hi>I</hi> was glad of the eſteem they had for him, which would give him the better opportunities of ſerving me; but, that the conſequence would be very ill, and directly oppoſite to my Authority, if the People got a Cuſtom of giving Commiſſions; <hi>I</hi> therefore ſigned one for him, and for that of the People commanded him to carry it back, and cancel it before them, which he did, very much ſatisfied, to have by ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs obtained his pretence.</p>
            <p>The Sieur <hi>de Ceriſantes</hi> impatiently ſuffering another to be poſſeſſed of the Charge he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, after ſome houres of diſcontent, put on another Face; and having heard of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of part of <hi>Calabria,</hi> which had ſent to me for a Chief to Command them, he thought he might there find ſomething conſiderable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to recompence the other loſs, and finding me out, accoſted me with very great Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Reſpect, Zeal and Fidelity; telling me, that his Fortune was in my hands, and firſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a great part of his adventures, misfortunes and voyages, acquainted me that a Lady of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was the cauſe, whom he had long loved, and was beloved again, but that coming too ſhort in birth and Fortune, he could not hope the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and advantage of marrying her; That ſhe had allowed him time to try whether his Actions and Merit could raiſe him ſo high in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Honour, that ſhe might Marry him
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57207:94"/>
without prejudice to her Reputation and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that fortune had been contrary to him on a hundred occaſions, wherein he had courted her, but had at laſt led him by the hand to my ſervice, where if I had a kindneſs for him, it was in my power to make him the happieſt of men.</p>
            <p>I hearkned to this <hi>Romance</hi> with a great deal of pleaſure, and asking what he had to pretend of me, he replied, the Government of the two <hi>Calabria's,</hi> with the Title of a Dutchie or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of ſome of the beſt Towns poſſeſſed in thoſe Provinces by ſome <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or other of the Nobility that was our enemy. I replyed, I could not ſpare him till I had ſome other to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt with the <hi>Cyphers,</hi> which poſſibly might happen at the arrival of the Fleet, or with the anſwer of a Letter I had written to <hi>Rome</hi> to that purpoſe; My reply, though very reaſonable, gave him no ſatisfaction, and going murmuring out of my Chamber, <hi>Lewis del Ferro</hi> coming in oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely, and asking me what was the matter with <hi>Ceriſantes,</hi> I thought it not amiſs to revenge my ſelf on one Fool by another, and told him what had paſſed in our Converſation <hi>Del Ferro</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently followed, with pretence that if <hi>Ceriſantes</hi> went from me, the Court <hi>Cypher</hi> ought to be left in his hand, he being Ambaſſadour: The other whoſe bloud was already heated, calling him Fool and Bedlam, refuſed to part with it in his behalf, whereupon <hi>Lewis del Ferro</hi> briskly replyed, he muſt either deliver it, or draw his Sword, <hi>Ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantes</hi> mad to ſee ſuch a Fellow in competition with him, came back, extremely tranſported, to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57207:94"/>
demand ſatisfaction for being treated with ſo little reſpect. I anſwered, laughing, that it is no affront to challenge a man, when the diſcourſe is not accompanied with Violence or Contempt, beſides that I knew not what reſpect belonged to him, nor what difference to make betwixt them; that, things well conſidered, the advantage was altogether on <hi>Lewis del Ferro</hi>'s ſide, becauſe I had order to treat with him as an Ambaſſadour, and had with my own hand delivered him <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Fontenay</hi>'s Letters, which gave him that title, and that himſelf was recommended to no other end, but to keep the <hi>Cyphers.</hi> At this he loſt all patience, ſwearing he was Ambaſſadour, and that if I did not right him on account of the affront he had received, he knew how to right himſelf. This diſ-reſpective reply obliged me to confine him to his Chamber, with order to the Captain of my Guard to ſet a Sentry at his door, and not to ſuffer him to converſe with any till I learned from the Kings Miniſters that were at <hi>Rome,</hi> in what quality they had ſent him to me, if as an Ambaſſadour, that he might receive all honours due to him; But on the contrary, if not as ſuch, I ſhould wrong my ſelf to let him pretend to be ſo; and that the honour of the Crown was too much concerned to ſuffer at the ſame time and in the ſame place two fools to uſurp that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. His paſſion being over, he ſent to begg my pardon, and conjure me not to write to <hi>Rome</hi> of what had paſſed, which would entirely ruine his fortune. I pitied, and would not undo him; but I kept him eight days in apprehenſion, by it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57207:95"/>
to rectifie his judgement and conduct. The ſame night happened an accident of which I heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing till I waked next morning; but that which ſeemed very ſtrange in it, is that I received two Letters from two ſeveral places, one over night and the other in the morning, to have a care of my Self, for endeavours were uſed to poiſon me, and that <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> had promiſed the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> to do it. A young man coming into my Kitchin a little before Supper, preſſed very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly towards the meat, which occaſioning ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion, he was turned out. He afterwards mixt with the Croud that came to ſee me ſup, and getting near the cupboard, holding ſomething in his hand, in a little Paper, offered a conſiderable ſumme of Money to a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> ſervant I had entertained after my arrival, to put it into my Glaſs when I ſhould call for drink. One of my guards having accidentally heard ſomething fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, and ſtopped him at his going out of my appartment, and carried him to the Chamber of his Captain, giving him notice of it, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told the ſame thing by my ſervant, would let me know nothing of it, till he had made a perfect diſcovery of the truth.</p>
            <p>After I was in bed they put him on the rack, where he confeſſed all, and the poiſon being found about him, it was tried on a Dog, who died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a quarter of an hour. When he was preſſed to declare where he had it, he ſaid it was given him by <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi>'s Adjutant, who was a man very intimate and much entruſted by his Colonel. In the Morning they acquainted me what had paſſed
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57207:95"/>
over night. I forbad them going ſo farre an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time, or precipitating a buſineſs of that nature without firſt acquainting me with it, and receiving my Orders. I would not cauſe him he had accuſed to be arreſted, and knowing the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> had in his quarter, thought it better to endeavour to gain than ruine him, reſolving to deal with him in ſo obliging a faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if he had any honour he ſhould ever acknowledge it, and be ever faithful to me. He came to wait on me at my riſing, and drawing him apart I ſhewed him the Letters of advice I had received, of the ill deſign was pretended he had againſt me; and cauſing the Captain of my Guards to relate to him what had paſſed, he ſaid he would be reſponſible for his friend that was accuſed; I ſeemed perſwaded of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and to put an end to the buſineſs, and more ſenſibly oblige him, commanded the Priſoner to be ſet at liberty. The report (though I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the contrary) was ſpred through all the Town, that I was poiſoned, and the people crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in multitudes to the gate of the <hi>Carmelites</hi>; demanding to ſee me. I got on horſeback to ride about the Quarters, and give them the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction they ſo earneſtly deſired; and being told that ſome on the Market-place accuſed <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> of this attempt, taking it to be neceſſary to juſtifie him, and make appear the confidence I had in him, that ſo I might entirely win him, I went to the <hi>Concheria,</hi> followed by an incredible multitude of people, and finding him at his door, told him, that coming out faſting I found my ſelf
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57207:96"/>
a little ill, and therefore deſired him to call for a Glaſs of Wine, with a Cruſt of Bread or ſome Sweet-meats; which when he had brought I drank to him, and having eaten of what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, embracing him, whiſpered in his ear, that what I had done was not out of any neceſſity of my own, but to clear him to the people, and make them witneſſes of the confidence I had in him, deſiring to continue him in the number of my friends. He proteſted never to fail in his fidelity, and to retain an eternal memorie of ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary a favour.</p>
            <p>I employed that day in viſiting the Poſts, and cauſing ſuch works as were not to my mind to be altered, ſtanding by all the while.</p>
            <p>No attacque was made either night or day, where I was not immediately preſent, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were amazed to find that not a Musket was fired, but I was preſently on the place, and ſurprized to meet continually in their way, and moſt commonly to their diſadvantage, ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours as I brought with me vigorouſly beating them back; in ſuch manner that all the time of my being in <hi>Naples</hi> I never came to blows with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out getting the better, and recovering ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table advantage from them. The people had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch affection and eſteem for me, that they thought themſelves invincible when I fought at their head; which cauſed the enemies to make it their onely buſineſs to deſtroy me, perſwaded that on my perſon alone depended their final ruine, or re-eſtabliſhment. Their poiſon having failed of the ſucceſs was expected, not onely in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57207:96"/>
that which hath been mentioned, but in two or three other attempts, they had recourſe to other ways of deſtroying me, by endeavouring to give a jealouſie of my conduct, and procuring my death by ſome ſedition or tumult. One Morning, the Market-place being full of people, where I was to reconcile a difference between two of their Chiefs, a little Boy gave me a Letter which he ſaid was of importance, and ſhifting away amongſt the Crowd, without any poſſibility of finding him, or learning of whom he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, I opened it, and ſeeing what it contained, read it aloud to the people, which in ſtead of cauſing their ſuſpition, animated their friendſhip for me, and their hatred againſt their enemies. It was directed to the Duke of <hi>Siane,</hi> ſon of the regent <hi>Capici Ladro,</hi> and in form of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to this purpoſe,</p>
            <p>That <hi>Don John</hi> had with a great deal of joy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the propoſal I made him of delivering a Poſt, and procuring his entrance into the Town, to give opportunity with Fire and Sword to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the rebellion of its inhabitants, but knowing that the goodneſs of the King his father would never approve ſo bloudie a revenge, looking upon the people as diſobedient children, whom yet he tenderly loved, and would reclaim by no other wayes but thoſe of demency, being reſolved to pardon them, he gave me thanks for my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which he was aſſured, and deſired me to continue it for a more favourable occaſion, ſince I came not to <hi>Naples</hi> without his participation, nor had undergone ſo many perils but to do him
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57207:97"/>
the better ſervice, by taking away all diſtruſt. That on his part he aſſured me that the Money I had demanded was ready, and that I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in Genoua, or any other place of which I would give intimation, That he made uſe of him, to negotiate with me being a perſon of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and my <hi>Friend,</hi> that I might repoſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confidence in it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>dull</hi> policy had no other effect than ſuch as I could wiſh, and altogether contrary to their deſign. The people murmured extremely and deteſting the malice, cried out, Long live the Duke of Guiſe our Protector, for whom we will ſpend our lives and fortunes, and ſacrifice our wives and children; and more to win them by a ſoft and compliable comportment, I granted all Pardons of Criminals that were demanded of me, and continued ſome days to do ſo, not finding in my heart to put any to death. But this people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to Bloud and Maſſacres, were deſirous of ſuch Spectacles, and finding by their diſcourſe and murmurings, that it was time to make my ſelf feared, (it being told me as I paſſed the Streets, that my goodneſs was too great in that I cauſed no executions, and that without ſuch examples I ſhould never contain within the limits of duty, ſuch as were become habituated in murders and robberies,) ſeven men having been impriſoned for ſuch actions, I cauſed them to be all hanged together, and found that this ſevere juſtice was very agreeable, and that the peoples reſpect and kindneſs for me was fortified and increaſed by it. And afterwards ſeeming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57207:97"/>
when I was deſirous to pardon, I made uſe of an addreſs which I continued to the laſt. Having notice given me of the time that a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal was to be brought to puniſhment, I orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it ſo, that I met him on the way, as if by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and (ſeeming angry that they that went before had not avoided him, but obliged me againſt my will to ſee him paſs) gave him his life at the ſuit of his Wife and Children, ſaying it was not reaſonable he ſhould die ſince his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had brought him to my preſence, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons being naturally inſeparable from the eyes of Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> thinking on nothing but his treaſon, ſecretly endeavoured to give <hi>Gennaro</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of the authority I daily acquired, to which he was very much diſpoſed of himſelf by finding a diminution of his reſpect, and <hi>Vincenzo</hi> daily complained to me of his brutality, ignorance, ſloth and avarice, which would ruine all at laſt if I took not the whole conduct upon me; he under-hand encouraging diſorders and plunders, and omitting nothing to obtain his ends. An accident happened that gave him a great deal of joy and hope, which yet brought on no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous event as he had expected: Three Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Regiment of <hi>Sebaſtian Landi,</hi> with his Serjeant Major, who had the Guard of the Gate of <hi>Albe,</hi> the moſt ſuſpitious and conſiderable of all we had, commanding the eaſieſt and moſt to be apprehended paſſage of the town (as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appear'd by the application the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made for buying it of him, by which they at
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57207:98"/>
laſt became Maſters of all, and reduced <hi>Naples,</hi> and conſequently the reſt of the Kingdom to their obedience) came to complain to me of the impriſonment of their Colonel, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them whether the enemies had made any Sallie, or there had happened any Skirmiſh, they told me no, but that <hi>Gennaro</hi> had clapt him up for oppoſing his plundering a houſe in his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, contrarie to the Proclamation I had made for prevention of ſuch violences. Going therefore to the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Tower, very much incenſed for ſo unreaſonable an action, I ſent the Serjeant Major and two of the Captains to cauſe the Guard to be doubled, leſt the enemy ſhould make advantage by this accident, and took onely one of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains with me. I found <hi>Gennaro</hi> with the Council and ſome of the City Captains, and other Chiefs of the people, who met me and rudely told me he knew what I came about, and that I was not to concern my ſelf in that affair. I went into the Hall where they were aſſembled, and uſing him with all the contempt that belonged to his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moved by a juſt indignation raiſed by his imprudence, and the hazard to which he expoſed the whole Town as well as my Perſon, without once looking on him, and walking up and down the room I told him, he knew well enough that the command of the Army belonging to me, all military perſons offending were to be puniſhed by me, and that upon any diſ-ſatisfaction he needed onely make his Complaint, and I ſhould do ſuch right as I judged convenient. That he ſhould have a care hereafter of doing as he had
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57207:98"/>
done, for I was reſolved not to ſuffer it. That I being entruſted with the ſecurity of the Town, my Honour and Life depended on it, which he ought not to hazard by his paſſion and humour. That the title of Protector was not given me to ſuffer my ſelf to be ill uſed, and contemned in ſuch a manner. That it was not juſt that a perſon of my condition, after the neglect of ſo many dangers, ſhould be every moment irrationally expoſed to ruine, where no honorable occaſion preſented it ſelf. He gave me an inſolent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which moving me to reply, that perſons ſo brutal and inſolent were not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by one of my quality, I broke my Staff on my Knee, and caſting away the pieces told him, I renounced the charge I had taken upon me, and aſſured him he ſhould be reſponſible for all ſuch miſchiefs as would infallibly follow, for the loſs of the Eſtates, and Lives of all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, the honour of their Families, the ſacking and deſolation of their City and whole Kingdom, which I abandoned to the cruel Vengeance of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> That I would immediately ſeek felucca's for my return, to leave a plate where I was ſo little valued, and where nothing could be acquired but infamy in ſtead of the honour I had propoſed to my ſelf: That I could not ſuffer a failing of the reſpect belonged to me, eſpecially by ſuch as he, and that I had a great mind before my departure to make him an example, and cauſe him to be thrown out of the Window.</p>
            <p>All that were preſent offered themſelves to perform this, he in the mean time weeping, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57207:99"/>
caſting himſelf at my feet, which he often kiſſed, begging my pardon, which was in like manner done by his Wife and Brother-in-law, with a thouſand demonſtrations of fear, and as many Proteſtations for the future to be more obedient and ſubmiſſive to me than the meaneſt perſon in the Town. All the Company on their Knees, and with tears in their eyes, beſought me to take again the command, they having no hope but in me alone, being for ever ruined if I laid aſide the defence of their liberty. I yielded to ſo many entreaties, and another Staff being preſented, accepted it as a mark of the Authority I re-aſſumed. After this I had much ado to hinder thoſe that were preſent from killing him, ſo great were their animoſities; I ſent back Colonel <hi>Landi</hi> to his charge, ordering him for the future to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to it, with the ſame punctuality, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance and zeal as formerly, of which he gave me all ſuch Promiſes, as this Obligation and the Friendſhip I had ever expreſſed for him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> at the head of thoſe of the <hi>Concheria,</hi> Matheo Damore followed by all <hi>Lavinare</hi> and the adjoyning quarters, and all thoſe of the Market-place in Arms, with loud cries and a furious tumult demanded the perſon of <hi>Gennaro</hi> to be delivered to them, that they might cut off his Head, and afterwards hang him up by the foot, by that Example to teach the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that belonged to me. I went down to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie them, which my appearance immediately did, after the aſſurance I gave them of my Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57207:99"/>
They often-times called me their Father and Defender, with tears conjuring me not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, ſince without me they could not hope deliverance from ſlavery, recommending to me the preſervation of their Lives and Fortunes, with the honour of their Families.</p>
            <p>This inſolent penitent not thinking himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, beſought me to protect him againſt the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the whole Town, and publiquely kneeled down before me to beg his Life, where I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him and commanded the people, ſince I had pardoned him and looked on him as the beſt and faithfulleſt of my Friends, to love and value him as formerly, I taking into my protection his intereſts and ſafety againſt all men. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I made uſeful to me an accident that might probably have given me much trouble and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He retired into his Tower, and I got on horſeback to ſhew my ſelf to the people, and viſit the condition of the Poſts, and vigilance of the Guards, that I might have nothing to fear in the night. As I paſſed by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Lawrence</hi>'s Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, I heard a noiſe in a Palace that belonged to a Perſon of Quality, and ſent an Officer of my Guards to enquire the occaſion, Who returned with word that fifteen or ſixteen perſons were plundering it; I commanded him to bring the chief of them to me, whom I asked whether he had not knowledge of my Proclamation, by which the pillaging of any Houſe was forbidden on pain of death. He told me Yes, but it being reported that arms were hidden there, he went to ſearch by authority of an order ſigned by my
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57207:100"/>
ſelf and <hi>Vincenzo Andrea.</hi> I demanded it, and finding my hand counterfeited, ſent for a Prieſt out of the Cloyſter to confeſs him, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, cauſed him to be hanged at the Barrs of a Window. This prompt Juſtice drew a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Benedictions on me, and ſo terrified all ſuch as till then had ſecurely committed the like out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, that no more of them were ever afterwards heard of in the Town.</p>
            <p>I very ſeriouſly applyed my ſelf to negotiate ſome intelligence with the Nobility, and ordered all ſuch Gentlemen as were in Town, to meet me the next Morning at the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> in order to a Conference I deſired to hold with them: they failed not of coming, nor I of an extraordinary careſſing them all. I told them that having come to <hi>Naples</hi> to no other purpoſe but to free all the Kingdom as well as the Town from the rigorous Domination of <hi>Spain,</hi> I thought it a happineſs to me to be in a condition to be uſeful to the Service of the Nobility, and that I was already ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompenſed for all the dangers I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, by having had the good fortune to ſecure the Houſes and Goods of many perſons of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from the fury of the people, more exaſperated againſt them by artifice of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and for want of underſtanding what was profitable and neceſſarie for themſelves than out of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular averſion. That I was very deſirous to find ways to reconcile them, ſince their intereſts ought to be one and the ſame; that they ought to be equally concerned in Liberty, which I could not acquire to the people without the Nobilities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57207:100"/>
advantage by it. That they both made up one body, in which the Nobility ought to poſſeſs the higheſt place, and preſerve the Rank and Prerogative God and Nature had given them. That a Perſon of my Quality could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget the eſteem belonged to Gentlemen, and that my actions ſhould hereafter make evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that I knew very well how to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between perſons of Birth and the Vulgar. That there was not any one amongſt them but ought to rejoyce for the falling of the authority into my hands, ſince in place of the out-rages they had formerly ſuffered, they ſhould find in me all civility, courteſie and paſſion to ſerve as well all of them in general as every one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>This Complement was as welcomely received as really and unfainedly made, and accompanied by thanks for the favourable effects they had already enjoyed, by my having freed all the Gentry from oppreſſion, and danger of the plunderings and inſolencies of the common people. To which I replyed that I had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet could merit their good opinion, but was confident that when time ſhould preſent me an opportunity to diſcover the ſincerity of my intentions, they would own themſelves to be in ſome manner obliged to me, and that though I ſhould fail of acquiring their perſons, I could not but hope ſome ſhare in their eſteem and friendſhip, and that how nearly ſoever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on <hi>Spain,</hi> it ſhould tranſport them no farther than their duty obliged them, becauſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57207:101"/>
they muſt needs yield ſomething of their hearts and inclinations to the care and pains I would take on all occaſions to do them ſervice. I then acquainted them that I daily expected the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, to depend on my Orders, provided with all things neceſſary to the enemies ruine, in which apprehending they might be involved, I conjured them to open their eyes, and provide for their ſecurity and advantage: I beſought them to make ſerious reflections on it, to give account of the true condition of affairs to the reſt of their order that were abſent, and to aſſure themſelves they might entirely relie upon me in all their Concernments; That for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, being now about ſettling the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by forming it into a Republique, they ſhould not exclude themſelves, nor ſuffer it to be framed ſimply popular, which would be much to their prejudice, and very difficult to be remedied after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; That I delayed that buſineſs, all I poſſibly could, to give them time to take a good reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That they had no longer to do with a <hi>Maſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niello</hi> nor a <hi>Gennaro,</hi> but with one that tenderly loved and valued them, and that would always preferr their intereſts above his own: that they therefore might and ought to have an entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in me. That I adviſed them to aſſemble themſelves, where I would be reſponſible they might with freedom and ſafety treat of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and take their meaſures in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures, becauſe ſomething poſſibly might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen would make it too late. I warily obſerved the Countenances of every one of them, ſo to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57207:101"/>
penetrate into their moſt ſecret thoughts; the greateſt part ſeemed chearful, ſome (as I imagined) moved by my diſcourſe, and all of them generally had ſomething of inclination and eſteem for me; the Prince of <hi>la Rocca</hi> Coſin to Cardinal <hi>Filo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marini</hi> excepted, who, though he rendered me all manner of reſpects and civilities imaginable, by his coolneſs ſufficiently diſcovered I was never to truſt him; of which at laſt I had but too great experience.</p>
            <p>I was quickly after ſenſible of the effect of this conference, which drew news from all parts, and which (after the conſideration of what I had told them) cauſed the greateſt part of the Gentry to wiſh me well, and deſire my preſervation, ſince on me alone depended their Eſtates, Perſons, and Families. I ſent a Complement to the Princeſs of <hi>Maſſa</hi> on the loſs of her Husband, which had ſo ſenſibly moved me, with offers to her Self and Children of all that could depend on my Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Credit: excuſing my ſelf that the weighty affairs that lay upon me, prevented my Perſonal paying her thoſe Civilities.</p>
            <p>I went often to Maſs to the Nunneries, where were Ladies of Quality, and viſiting them at the Grate, deſired them to ſend to their Relations all manner of Complements and offers in my name, and deſired them to give me notice of all things in which I might oblige and ſerve them: In a word, I omitted nothing in my power that tended to gain the Nobility, without whom I knew the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not ſupport themſelves, their Conjunction making their principal force, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57207:102"/>
which was moſt likely to give me danger and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. Being one day at one of the Cloiſters, I deſired to ſee the Princeſs of <hi>Sens</hi> and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to whom I made my Compliments, as to a perſon animated againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the Death of her Husband, and that by conſequence would be very glad to draw off from their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice all her Relations, and engage them with me. I thought it alſo good Policy to ſhow ſome kind of conſideration for the memory of <hi>Maſaniello,</hi> he having laid the firſt foundation of the liberty of <hi>Naples</hi>; and cauſing his Widow to be found out, who was reduced to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt neceſſity, I took particular care for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, which I continued to the time of my impriſonment; which was very acceptable to all the People.</p>
            <p>In the mean time want of Victuals neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me to hazard all for making a way for their entrance, I reſolved to take the field, and attempt <hi>Averſa,</hi> though with very great difficulty, and little hope. I prepared to March the Twelfth of <hi>December,</hi> with my Regiment Commanded by <hi>Pepe Palombe,</hi> that of <hi>Jacomo Roſſo,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of one thouſand Muſquetiers, and two others, which I afterwards gave to Sieur <hi>Peres,</hi> and <hi>de Mallet,</hi> and that of <hi>Antonio de Calco</hi>; with the Companies of <hi>Onofrio Piſacani, Carlo Longobardo</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Batimiello,</hi> making about four hundered Muſquetiers, and all my Infantry three thouſand five hundered, or four thouſand Men; of which fifteen hundered were not Armed, and the greateſt part of them without Swords, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57207:102"/>
only Staves hardened at the end in the fire. Beſides theſe, there were four or five hundered <hi>Lazares,</hi> who carried long Poles with Iron hooks, with which they pretended to attaque the Cavalry, and pull the Horſemen out of their Saddles. <hi>Aniello de Falco</hi> Commanded the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, which conſiſted of four Field-pieces, with proportionable Equipage. Having no more than four hundred pound of Powder, to make a greater ſhow I carried ſome Barrels of Sand, a <hi>Malteſe</hi> being Commiſſary. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry conſiſted of the Company of my Guardes, of that of General <hi>Cicio Ferlingere</hi> Commanded by his Lieutenant, himſelf diſabled by the gout; of <hi>Gennaro,</hi> to whom <hi>Horacio Vaſſalo</hi> was Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, thoſe of <hi>Andrea Rama, Rocco, Damiane,</hi> and the brother of <hi>Auguſtin de Lieto,</hi> who might make five or ſix hundered Horſe. The Sieur <hi>D'orillac</hi> my Servant, that was to Command my Troop of light-Horſe, did the duty of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-general of the Horſe; <hi>Philip Prignani,</hi> an Advocate, was Commiſſary General, and the whole Body under me to be Commanded by the Baron of <hi>Modene,</hi> in quality of Camp-Maſter-General: <hi>Bernardo Spinto</hi> was Judge Advocate. This little Army had its Rendezvous in a large Plain without the Gate of <hi>Capua,</hi> at the end of the Suburbs of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> where, drawn in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia, it expected me to March the Twelfth of <hi>December</hi> at two in the Afternoon; but, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable accident cauſed me to differ my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture till the next morning.</p>
            <p>Whil'ſt my Servants were yet at Dinner, I
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57207:103"/>
went into the Market-place, and while I cauſed Arms to be given to a new-levied Company of a hundred Men, I had advice, that the Enemy, (not without reaſon, ſuppoſing my abſence would cauſe ſome diſorder) attacqued the Poſtes of the Cuſtom-houſe, of St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi>-Iſle, and <hi>Viſita Pauveri,</hi> and were become Maſters, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found them unprovided, thoſe that were entruſted with. the Guard having abandoned them to go home and Dine at their own Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. I immediately ſent the Company that was upon the place, to oppoſe them, and Orders to my Servants to get a Horſeback, and continue ready to follow me, and galloped to the <hi>Capuan</hi> Gate, where I ordered the Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> to draw out five hundred Musketiers, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Anthonio de Calco,</hi> and ſent for the three hundred <hi>Cavaioles</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained (on whom I could ſafely depend, and who ſerved me with a great deal of courage and ſucceſs in this occaſion) to make all haſte towards me, and returning as ſwiftly as I went, placing my ſelf at the head of my Servants, and ſome few others the noiſe had drawn to me, making in all about forty Horſe, marched ſtreight to the Enemie; The Company I ſent out of the Market-place being not gone farr, I quickly overtook it, and having paſſed two Streets, and arriving at the <hi>Celleria,</hi> a place very ſpacious, eſpecially in that part of it which is near the Fountain of the Serpents, and as it were in the middle of the Town, I ſaw three hundred <hi>Italian</hi> Reformado's, who began to put themſelves in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57207:103"/>
order, and had their firſt Rank of <hi>Partiſans.</hi> I charged them vigorouſly, and having broken, purſu'd them as farr as the Cuſtom-houſe, and alighting from my Horſe at a little bridge I was to paſs, fell pell-mell in amongſt them, and drove them from that Poſte with a very great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they endeavoured to lodge themſelves in ſome ruines, from which I alſo drove them. All my Troopes being come up, they again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to entrench themſelves, and my Men briskly repulſed them: but the Fight growing warme, my Powder begin to fail, and I ſent for ſome to <hi>Gennaro,</hi> who ſent me a Barrel, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came, we were conſtrain'd to oppoſe with our Swords and caſting of ſtones, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts they made upon us with good Muskets, which laſted above a great halfe hour: at the end whereof, taking advantage of my want of Ammunition, they made up the Worke they had undertaken. In this extremity I gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Colonel <hi>Melone,</hi> with five hundered Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers to re-take the Iſland of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> which he did with little reſiſtance; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cauſing him to fall out into the open field, followed by three hundred with Swords in their hands, leaving the reſt to guard what had been regain'd, I ſent him to cut off the enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and endeavour to poſſeſs himſelf of the Cuſtom-houſe of Corne. I drew out <hi>Anthonio de Calco,</hi> with two hundred Muſquetiers to drive them out of <hi>Viſita Pauveri:</hi> And in the mean time went up into one of the Roomes yet in our poſſeſſion, where cauſing Oyl, which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57207:104"/>
I found in great quantity, to be made hot, breaking through a Wall, I made it be thrown upon the Enemy; and making uſe of pitch'd Ropes and Faggots, which had been reſerved to attempt the burning ſome ſhips, they could no longer reſiſt, and were forced to retreat, by which I preſerved the Town, that without my diligence and vigour had been loſt; the Enemy having entered and advanced within two ſtreets of the Market-place.</p>
            <p>Having ſecured all there, I went to <hi>Viſita Paveri,</hi> which we had re-taken, but not thinking it enough, I gained a whole ſtreet, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced a Worke as farr as the <hi>Italian</hi> Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; and finding that ſome <hi>Spaniards</hi> were Poſted in the upper Rooms of the laſt houſe, I made uſe of the Powder I had ſent for, and which was but then brought me, to blow them up, where they loſt twelve or fourteen men.</p>
            <p>In all this occaſion, which laſted above two houres, one of the hotteſt and moſt obſtinate that had been ſeen in <hi>Naples,</hi> there were but two or three ſlain on my ſide, and five or ſix hurt: and, by confeſſion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of my Priſon, they had ſix ſcore Reformadoes killed, or dangerouſly wounded, moſt of them by Swords. This action very much reincouraged the People, by whom I was received with extraordinary applauſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> taking to heart this dayes mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, attributed its effect only to my preſence, and (ſuppoſing me gone out of the Town) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to revenge themſelves in the night, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57207:104"/>
that the People, in ſtead of providing for their defence, would employ themſelves in Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, they therefore filled up the places of ſuch Officers as had been ſlain, held in readineſs a conſiderable body, and about eleven a Clock ſmartly aſſaulted the Cuſtom-houſe: But, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of what importance it was to us, on the conſervation or loſs of this Poſt the fate of the Town depending, I had viſited it about nine or ten that night, which occaſioned their find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Guards doubled and very exact, and were not a little ſurpriſed (immediately after the begining of the skirmiſh) to learn my arrival by the Souldiers Exclamations of long live his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs our Protector. This cauſed them to faint and retreat, leaſt the night might prove as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate to them as the Day; They diſcharged their choler by firing their Canon, of which they were quickly weary, finding they ſpent their Powder in vain. In the mean time, in their ſight, I finiſhed the making up our breaches, which 1 had begun before dinner, and put this Poſte in a condition to fear nothing but Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and indeed after this they never durſt attempt it. Afterwards I went to reſt, that I might be ready in the morning to order all things neceſſary for our defence, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the Council were to act, for putting all in ſo ſecure a poſture, that the enemy might attempt nothing, in the time my abſence might perſwade them they ſhould find all things eaſie.</p>
            <p>The next morning, being the thirteenth of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57207:105"/>
               <hi>December,</hi> at Day-break, I got on horſeback to viſit the Poſtes and Quarters of the Town, and leave ſuch orders as ſhould be neceſſary. I gave the Command of the Cuſtom-houſe to Colonel <hi>Melone,</hi> with a Serjeant-Major, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Souldiers under him; All the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quarters I likewiſe took under my Authority, as the Iſle of St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> guarded by a Captain, <hi>De Porto</hi> and <hi>Viſita Pauveri</hi> by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant-Major: Colonel <hi>Pouca</hi> had the Guard of St. <hi>Clare,</hi> and a Serjeant-Major of the lower end of <hi>Cedrangulo.</hi> St. <hi>Dominico Soriano</hi> was entruſted to Colonel <hi>Hannibal Brancaccio</hi>; Mount <hi>Oliveto</hi> to a Serjeant-Major; The Gate of <hi>Albe</hi> and St. <hi>Sebaſtians</hi>-Cloyſter, to Colonel <hi>Sebaſtian Landi</hi>; the <hi>Corne-Ditch</hi> to Captain <hi>Cicio Coſta</hi>; St. <hi>Dominico</hi> and St. <hi>Anielli</hi> to two other Captains. Saint <hi>Gennaroes Gate,</hi> and the <hi>Virgins Suburbs</hi> to Colonel <hi>Diego Paſſero.</hi> The <hi>Gate</hi> of <hi>Nola</hi> and its <hi>Suburb</hi> to Colonel <hi>John Dominico,</hi> that of <hi>Capua</hi> and St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs to Colonel <hi>Gaſtaldo</hi>; thoſe of St. <hi>Effremo</hi> to Colonel <hi>Dom Bernardo Caſtracucco:</hi> that of <hi>Poſilippe</hi> to a Serjeant-Major; of <hi>Foragrotto</hi> and two or three other little Towns, or rather Suburbs, to the Command of Serjeant-Major <hi>Alexio,</hi> who after the taking of <hi>Chiaia</hi> was made Colonel and Governor of it, of <hi>Cavone,</hi> to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Lombardi</hi>; of <hi>La Cellaria</hi> to Captain <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino</hi>; of <hi>La Monnoi</hi> to Captain <hi>Ignatio Spagnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olo</hi>; of <hi>La Vinara</hi> to Captain <hi>Mathew Damore</hi>; of the <hi>Concieria</hi> to <hi>Pepe Palombe,</hi> and in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to his Lieutenant; of <hi>La Sauateria</hi> to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57207:105"/>
Captain <hi>Pepo Ricco</hi>; of <hi>La Pietra del Peſte</hi> to <hi>Onoffrio Pagano</hi>; of the Market-place to <hi>Genna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s Captain of his guards under himſelf: Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning all other quarters of the Town their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Captains, and the guard of the <hi>Vicairie</hi> to <hi>Graſſulo de Roza,</hi> with the cuſtody of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the charge of head-Jaylor: giving them all ſuch Orders as were neceſſary, and wherewithal to make punctual payments to their Souldiers, out of the Stock I have already ſayed I appointed for it.</p>
            <p>All thus regulated for what concerned the Souldiery, I ſent for the Magiſtrates, and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi> being preſent, told them, That all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for preſervation of the Town would be uſeleſs, unleſs they ſupplyed the want of Proviſions, and took care that the People might live quietly, and without murmur, in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Plenty I ſhould reſtore them; which I doubted not very ſuddenly to effect, it being the onely cauſe of my taking the field: And for the Council, I conjured them to aſſiſt <hi>Gennaro</hi> with their beſt advice, obſerve narrowly his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and reſolve nothing of importance without communicating it to me. That this could no wayes retard Affaires, ſince I ſhould not go to any farther diſtance, then ſuch as admitted a mutual correſpondence twice a day. That I depended on them in my abſence; That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd us to be unanimous, our Intereſt being one and the ſame; and that the Liberty we all ſo paſſionately aſpired to, muſt be as much the Work of their Heads, as my Hands. I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57207:106"/>
recommended theſe things (beſides ſuch other as belonged to his charge of Commiſſary general of the Proviſions) to <hi>Vincenzo Andrea, Tonno Baſſo, Aniello Porcio, Anthonio Scacciaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtino Mollo,</hi> and recommended to this laſt, in whom I had entire confidence, to look after all my Concernments, to give me punctual advice of all things, and oppoſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever might be undertaken to my prejudice, which would be eaſie for him, he being a perſon very active, intelligent and dextrous, really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to me, for whom he had an extraordinary zeal and affection.</p>
            <p>All theſe but neceſſary precautions having ſpent more time than I expected, night coming on, I could do no more than take up my lodging in the Suburbs of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> to be the readier to be gone next Morning, being the fourteenth of <hi>December</hi> at day break. However I firſt took my leave and the Benedictions of Cardinal <hi>Filoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi> and viſited the holy Reliques of Saint <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro.</hi> I releaſed <hi>Ceriſantes</hi> from his Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Chamber, with permiſſion to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me into the Field: and ſending for him in the Evening, after a repriment, and advice to make a good uſe of what had happened to him, he told me, that that which ſo importunely preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to a ſudden Proviſion for his fortune was his apprehenſion leſt the Fleet might bring ſome one by the Kings order to take his place, and the <hi>Cyphers</hi> from him; which would be extremely to his prejudice, by the loſs of his Credit and Reſpect, in ſuch manner that if his fortune were
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57207:106"/>
not made before, it would afterwards be very difficult; he added, that I was in the like hazard, being employed only out of pure neceſſity for want of another, that I was not beloved; that they were jealous and diſtruſtful of my exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that I ought no leſs then he to haſten to an eſtabliſhment, ſince ſome one might come with the Fleet capable of poſſeſſing my place. I muſt acknowledge, that the often compariſon he made of him and me, was as diſpleaſing to me as it was neither juſt nor reſpective: So that I replyed, he had ſome reaſon to be troubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were a great many perſons capable of the employment he had about me, and that would accept it without conſideration, whether he were diſpleaſed or ſatisfied: but that my Birth would deterr any from diſobliging me lightly, that there were few perſons in the World qualified to take upon them my imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, how glorious ſoever, had too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Toiles and hazards. That, if my being at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> were diſagreeable to the King, and my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices ſuſpected, I ſhould be alwayes ready, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any importunity, to retire on his leaſt order: But, without that, if any one ſhould have the vanity by intrigues and cabals, to go about to diſpoſſeſs me, and make advantage by my ſpoils, as well as by my travel and induſtry, it ſhould not paſs unpuniſhed; and that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were, they ought to conſider well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they expoſed themſelves to ſuch a hazard, without bringing me an Order, to which my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57207:107"/>
and fidelity would prevent any reply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incapable of any other paſſion then that of ſerving my Maſter, and obeying his pleaſure; but that I knew very well how to vindicate my ſelf againſt ſuch as ſhould outrage me without ground or reaſon, and that I ſhould aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be much more apprehended and feared then he could be by ſuch as deſigned to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave him of his imployment.</p>
            <p>Let the World judge if this anſwer contains any thing contrary to reſpect and fidelity, yet it was imputed a Crime, and looked on as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace againſt ſuch as ſhould come to negotiate on behalfe of the Crown, were it that my words were not faithfully reported, or that they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to pervert their meaning.</p>
            <p>A few dayes after, the reality of my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions appeared, and my reſpects were juſtified by my Comportment with the Abbot <hi>Baſchi,</hi> to whom I performed continual civilities out of conſideration of the Character he bore of the Kings Envoy, though I was fully informed he endeavoured my ruine by many intrigues, nay, managed a conſpiracy againſt my life, ſerving in it the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (to whom I certainly knew him to be a Pentioner) to the prejudice of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I went, I diſpatched Commiſſions to ſeveral <hi>Banditi,</hi> who had drawn together, and deſired that they might take Armes through the whole Kingdom: theſe are a ſort of People very proper for inſurrections, but that commit
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57207:107"/>
ſo many diſorders and outrages, that they ruine all whereſoever they paſs; and who afterwards are uſually made Sacrifices to the publick ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, the affection of the People being regained at the price of their heads, after they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all ſuch ſervices as they are can b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of; They regard neither word nor oath in their capitulations, nor make any difference in the uſage of ſuch Towns and places as yield volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, or are ſtormed by force; with them the example of Fathers is to be followed, who burn the Rods after the Correction of their Children. I cauſed <hi>Papone</hi> to March by the <hi>Garigliano,</hi> with two Gentlemen of the Family of <hi>Daretzo,</hi> who in a ſhort time made themſelves Maſters of all thereabouts, and (after many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts) of <hi>Seſſa,</hi> and the Tower of <hi>Sperlonga,</hi> where Captain <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Piemont</hi> was left Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. The Sieur <hi>de Laſcari</hi> marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Fondi,</hi> of which he poſſeſſed himſelf; <hi>Marcello Turſo</hi> into <hi>Calabria, Pietro Creſcentio</hi> towards <hi>Monte Fuſcolo</hi>; The Earl of <hi>Vaglie</hi> and <hi>Matheo Chriſtiano</hi> into the Country of <hi>Barie,</hi> and <hi>Mazotta</hi> into <hi>Baſilicata, Sabato Paſtorie</hi> into <hi>Apulia:</hi> other <hi>Bandites</hi> into <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> where afterwards many other Perſons declared for us, whom I ſhall nominate and ſpeak of in time and place, <hi>Polito Pastena</hi> commanded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Salerno, Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the <hi>Vaſſals,</hi> towards St. <hi>Severino, Nocera, La Cava,</hi> and <hi>Avellino,</hi> and I ſent them for this purpoſe the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaioles</hi> that continued yet in <hi>Naples</hi>: It gave great aſtoniſhment to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57207:108"/>
attacqued on all ſides, and I drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo numerous forces, that in leſs than a Moneth the whole Kingdom declared for me, and all the Towns came in, except ſuch as had Caſtles and Citadels, and the whole Nobility was neceſſitated to have recourſe to me for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards, and ſecuring their Lands and Houſes from Plunder; in which I took all care imaginable, that I might gain them, and when they were forced to abandon all, wiſhed them to ſend People of their own to preſerve their rents and moveables: this wrought ſo much on them, that they afterwards fought againſt me, with great reſpect, and concerned themſelves in my ſafety, as neceſſary to that of their Fortunes, Wives and Children, on which account there are very few amongſt them that are not obliged to me, and that have not kept alive for me (in their Hearts) their acknowledgments and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>After three houres March I came to <hi>Juliano,</hi> a place very populous, and from whence there goes forth to take the field every year a great many <hi>Banditi,</hi> here I found five hundred good men in Armes; I made it my Head Quarter, and ſent the reſt of my Troops to St. <hi>Antimo,</hi> halfe a League diſtant, and ſcituated on a ſmall Rivolet, with Order to entrench, as I did all the avenues of my Quarter, after I had taken a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent view of them. Returning to my Lodging, I found there the Marchioneſs of <hi>Ataviane,</hi> a Lady of Quality, who came to deſire a ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, which I immediately appointed her, with
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57207:108"/>
a Coach to return, ſhe having come a Foot in very ill way, and as bad weather: Being a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and having two Sons well grown, ſhe deſired leave to ſend them to <hi>Naples</hi> to their Relations, with ſome Mony and Jewels, to which I conſented with a Paſſeport for their ſecurity, ſhe going away extreamly ſatisfied with my Civilities, and reſolved, as ſhe aſſured me, to uſe all her endeavours to gain me her friends and Kindred.</p>
            <p>I had brought with me an <hi>Augustine</hi> Frier, very well known to all the Nobility, as having been Companion to Father <hi>Andrea d' Avallos,</hi> afterwards a Biſhop, brother of the Marquiſs of <hi>Vaſte,</hi> called Father <hi>Thomas Sebaſtian,</hi> very much affected to me, and who being a man of partes, might be uſeful to me in my negotiation. He told me, there lived hard by a Gentleman called <hi>Vincenzo Carafa,</hi> a very underſtanding perſon, and great enemy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who could eaſily negotiate with the Nobility that had retired into <hi>Averſa,</hi> I appointed him to bring him to me next morning at my riſing: After this, being informed that there was a great Town called St. <hi>Ciprian,</hi> about half a League off, from whence the Enemy had received a great deal of Corn, and where yet there might remain twelve or fourteen thouſand ſacks, I ſent for <hi>Jacomo Roſſo,</hi> who, as a famous <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dito,</hi> knew very well the way, and had a great credit amongſt that People; I commanded him with his Regiment, which conſiſted of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand good Men, to March thither the next
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57207:109"/>
morning at day-break, which might eaſily be done without any fear of the Enemies Horſe, the Country being broken with Ditches, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with Trees; that without making any halt, or ſuffering himſelf to be amuſed by light skirmiſhes, or ſmall parties, which would que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs be ſent after him, he ſhould make thither as faſt as he could, and entrench himſelf ſo as to keep it, till I could convey all the Corn to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> His imprudence in not obſerving my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, engaged me the next day in a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Combat, which yet had no other effect then to gain me honor, and an opportunity which I ſo well managed, that it proved the Fountain of all the good ſucceſs that afterward arrived to me, and went very near to give an irreparable loſs to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vincenzo Carafa</hi> was with me the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at my riſing, whom (to ſecure him from ſuſpition) I had ſent for by four of my Guards; I ſhut my ſelf up with him an hour and halfe, and was aſſured that the Nobility, being greater Enemies to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> than the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, did more paſſionately deſire to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves delivered from their Government, but that their hatred for the Multitude, and their apprehenſion of becoming ſubject to them, was the only conſideration reſtrained them from attempting the ways of Liberty: I ſpoke to him all ſuch things as I thought might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and free him from his diſtruſt; very glad to underſtand my intentions, he aſſured me, I ſhould not find any of the Nobility that would
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57207:109"/>
not joyfully have recourſe to me, own me as their head, and readily obey all my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: After many embraces I ſent him to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa,</hi> well inſtructed, and well affected with a Paſſeport, under pretence of retiring with thoſe that were already there, and cauſed him to be accompanied by Father <hi>Thomas Sebaſtian,</hi> who pretended he came thither to give account to ſome of the Gentlemen of their particular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs entruſted to his managing. I very much depended on this negotiation, of which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great hopes: but, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion of <hi>Vincenzo Carafa,</hi> who was too eager and paſſionate, though ſomething was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, yet not all that I expected: He was very favourably received and heard, but open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to too many, was made Priſoner, for which I was very ſorry.</p>
            <p>I was but juſt ſet down to Dinner, when <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>como Roſſo</hi> ſent me word he had met ſome Scouts of the Enemies Horſe, and purſued them to the Portes of <hi>Averſa,</hi> where he had engaged them with conſiderable advantage; ſo as if I immediately came to him, he aſſured me of taking it. I was ſo ſurprized by this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant news, that riſing haſtily from the Table I threw it down, and cauſing inſtantly to ſound to Horſe, reſolved to hazard all to ſave him, and prevent his Regiment from being cut in pieces, it being the beſt body of Foot I had; I ſent him order to come off, whil'ſt I attacqued ſuch Troops as I reaſonably imagin'd the Enemy would ſend to meet me, to hinder my diſengaging him, &amp; cut off his retreat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:57207:110"/>I commanded the Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> to place at the head of my Quarter, which I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched, two pieces of Canon charged with carthages, and to ſend me five hundred Musquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, to ſecure all the ſtreight paſſages by which I was to retreat, and to keep all the reſt of the foot in arms in the Quarter, as well for its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, as to be ready to march where I ſhould have occaſion for them, not doubting to receive a repulſe, knowing that there were in <hi>Averſa</hi> about three thouſand horſe. I cauſed <hi>D'orillac</hi> to draw out the Horſe Guard, with orders to take a view of the enemy, to endeavour to amuſe them by a Skirmiſh, to give me immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate notice of their march, to have a care not to engage himſelf too lightly, and gain me time to put my ſelf in order of Battle in the high way from <hi>Averſa</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> which had on each ſide two great Ditches, as is uſual in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Countrey being all divided into little Cloſes, on whoſe Borders grow Fruit-trees, encompaſſed with Vines, as in many parts of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Lombardie.</hi> I left my Infantry in the places in which I thought it would be moſt neceſſary, and cauſed the Troops that were quartered in S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo</hi> to advance, to hinder my being that way cut off behind. I had ſcarce begun to put my men in order, when <hi>D'orillac</hi> having found the enemie nearer him than he had imagined, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by reaſon of the defect of his ſight, was charged by a Squadron of Horſe commanded by Captain <hi>Latin,</hi> whoſe Hat he ſhot off with his Piſtol, and turning his horſe about to retreat,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57207:110"/>
the ground being bad, fell, and was unhappily taken under him, and carried away Priſoner; ſoon after which a <hi>Spaniard</hi> called <hi>Don Diego de Halamo</hi> gave him two wounds with a Sword behind, with which he killed him in cold bloud, to the extraordinary regret of the Nobility of <hi>Naples,</hi> who abominated ſo vile an action. I ſaw the guard come back galloping, which falling on a Squadron that was before me, diſordered and reverſed it on mine. I was ſo ſtrongly ſhaken that my horſe was forced into a Ditch, the Captain of my Guards caſt on the ground, and his Hat loſt; as ſoon as I got up I was faine to fly two mile with all the reſt of my horſe, to gain ground to rally, being all that while encloſed by two Ditches that were on each ſide the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, in ſuch a manner that had the enemy made a vigorous purſuite, they might have followed beating me to the gates of <hi>Naples,</hi> without any poſſibility of my turning Head. But perceiving the enemy ſlack in the chaſe of us, I galloped to be head of theſe Runaways, and did my utmoſt endeavour with words and blows of the flat of my Sword to renew the fight. Captain <hi>Rocco</hi> ran away at the head of his Company, without looking behind him, crying out that he was very much wounded, though there was nothing of it, and riding over ſuch of my foot as he found at the head of my Quarter, entered very much aſtoniſhed. At my return I caſhiered him, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to be diſarmed, with all ſuch marks of infamy as his cowardice merited: lifting up my hand to ſtrike with my Sword an Officer I could
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57207:111"/>
no otherways cauſe to ſtand, I perceived it was <hi>Philip Prignani,</hi> Commiſſary general of the Horſe, who had a little bloud on his hand, cauſed by a ſcratch of a Nail on the Pommel of his Sadle, which he would have perſwaded me to have taken for a cut of a Sword, telling me he ſhed that bloud with joy for my ſervice, as he would do all that remained whenſoever there ſhould be occaſion, and that he was ſhot through the Reins with a <hi>Carabine</hi>; I ſent him into the Quarter to be dreſſed, which was the onely thing he deſired.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I made a ſtand in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all alone, and called out that ſuch as had honour ſhould turn to me; thirty men came in, whom having drawn up, whileſt the reſt were rallying, I with them charged ſuch of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as were in diſorder, who falling back on two Squadrons that were to be their ſeconds, broke them, whom I purſued about a mile to a little bridge where I made a halt. The Lazares ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining there was no more to be done but plunder and get Horſes, demanded my leave to do ſo, I gave it them with a very good will, deſirous to rid my hands of them, as of uſeleſs and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom fellows, I therefore told them that getting out into the Field they ſhould advance as farre as poſſible, to endeavour to fall on the enemies rear, which they imprudently doing, I attained my end, three hundred of them being killed. I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took a Lieutenant of Horſe that commanded the enemies Scouts, and who made good the rear during their retreat: him I took priſoner, proud
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57207:111"/>
to have yielded to me, and to have been deprived of his Liberty by my hand. My Runaways per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the enemies had turned their backs, and that I had vigorouſly repelled them, rallying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to march, as believing there was nothing more to be feared, when I was ſuddenly fired up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by thirty or fourty Muſquettiers, who under ſhelter of two Houſes were left to guard the bridge, they killed fourteen of the thirty that were with me, the reſt aſtoniſhed, fled, and left me with onely two perſons in my company, of whom the <hi>Malteſe</hi> Commiſſary of the Artillery was one, him I ſent to cauſe two hundred Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettiers to advance, and ſeeing fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of my ſervants coming along with Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks I met them, and drew them into the Ditches that were on each ſide of the way, forbidding them to ſhew themſelves, or fire till I gave them order; Three Squadrons of the enemy filing after each other, paſſed the bridge, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards drew up again before me, from amongſt whom the Prince of <hi>Minorvine</hi> advanced, with his ſword drawn, threatning and ranting our runaways, and ſeeing two of my footmen by me, whoſe Livery of Green Velvet laced with Gold was very remarkable, ſtruck down one cloſe by my ſtirrup with a great blow of his Sword on the head: I asked <hi>Horatio Vaſallo</hi> if he knew that ſo gallant and handſom perſon; he, miſtaking, told me it was the Prince of <hi>Torello,</hi> I then ſent him to rally his Troop, and bring it to me, and the mean while rid right up to the other, who mounted a freſh Horſe was brought him,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57207:112"/>
of a dappled gray, very beautiful, within ten paces of me, and drawing my Piſtol, called to him, Prince of <hi>Torello,</hi> whileſt your men advance and mine rally, ſince we are accidentally met, let us exchange a brace of Bullets, there is honour to be won on either ſide; but he retreated without attending me, I followed and when I came near called to him to yield to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> but looſning the rains to his Horſe, he quickly out-went mine that was almoſt tired. I would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther venture to ſhoot at ſuch a diſtance, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my ſelf in his purſuit which was too hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, he calling to his men to advance, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing himſelf at their head, to oppoſe mine which he ſaw marching towards him. I perceived ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gentlemen in his firſt Rank, by the beauty of their Horſes, and black Velvet Coats. I turned towards them, and (pickering) ſought to engage them to follow me; when they came near me I retreated twenty paces, then again wheeling and doing as before; this at laſt inſenſibly drew them into the turning of the way where I had lodged my Fire-locks, to whom I made ſign with my Hat to fire, and every one to chooſe his man which proved very fatal. <hi>Don Emanuel de Vais,</hi> Captain of Horſe, was ſhot dead, The Marquis <hi>de Paihede</hi> had his right hand ſhattered, The Marquis of <hi>Saint Juliani</hi> received two ſhots, one in his ſide and the other in his head, of which four dayes after he died; in fine ſeven of the braveſt fell; their Squadron was ſhaken and weakned by thoſe that carried off the dead and wounded, and my men recovering cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57207:112"/>
beat them back to the Bridge a ſecond time, from whence I was driven by their Horſe and ſome Muſquettiers, at whoſe head the Duke of <hi>Andria</hi> placing himſelf for their encouragement, they repaſſed the Bridge with three Squadrons, My men were again diſcouraged, and having diſcharged their Carabines, left me the third time alone in the High-way, where I thought my ſelf ſafer than formerly, becauſe of the apprehenſion my Foot gave the Enemy. However, the firſt Squadron marching in very good order to charge me, the Duke of <hi>Andria</hi> with his Sword in his hand, leading them, commanded them to halt, whether unwilling to engage, or, as he told me at our interview two days after, loth to attacque my Perſon, and bring me into a new danger; In this interim, the Foot I had ſent for being come up, after the Enemy had a ſight of them, I placed them in the ditches, and with all my horſe, now in better heart, and in a body, marched to them, and again drove them over that fatal Bridge, where the skirmiſh grew hot, and laſted more than a great quarter of an hour. In this purſuit an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers horſe being fallen, I ſaw him encompaſſed by ſome Raſcals that went about to kill him with many wounds, but hearing him call for quarter. I rid up to him, and driving away thoſe that would ſo cruelly have maſſacred him, he yielded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to me with a great deal of joy, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to one of my Guards, I ſent him to my Quarter. The reaſon of my ſo eaſie gaining this laſt advantage, was the Duke of <hi>Andria</hi>'s having gone back to draw five hundred horſe out of his
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57207:113"/>
rear to cut off my retreat. I ran very great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard in this rancontre, not ſo much from the Enemy, as my own men, who diſcharging behind me, burned my hair and feathers. <hi>Jacomo Roſſo</hi> obeying the order I had ſent him, making uſe of the Ditches and Trees that were in the fields, made a happy retreat ſtill fighting, not looſing above nine or ten men, with the like number wounded. The horſe that ſhould have cut off my retreat, meeting two hundred Muſquettiers I had to that purpoſe left on a paſſage, affrighted by their fire thought of nothing but getting back. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all which, my Men were alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their March, crying out we were cut off, in ſuch manner, that I had much ado to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, by perſwading them, it was our own Horſe of the quarter of St. <hi>Antimo,</hi> whom I had cauſed to advance in favour of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, which I had alſo ſecured by placing Foot at all paſſes. But, ſome of them perceiving this Body was greater then that I ſpoke of, I told them the Squadron that appeared had no depth, and that taking advantage of the ſhade of Trees, and night which approached, I had commanded to make a large front, in order to a greater appearance; and as ſoon as I heard that <hi>Jacomo Roſſo</hi> was in ſafety, having made this Fight only in order to that, <hi>I</hi> thought of nothing but getting off; <hi>I</hi> gave the conduct of the Rear to the Sieur <hi>de Ceriſantes,</hi> who came in very luckily, and cauſing thirty of the moſt reſolute of my Guardes to alight, they hindered the Enemy from paſſing the bridge, with order,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57207:113"/>
in caſe they were too much preſſed on, that (abandoning their Horſes, and leaping the Ditch) they ſhould retreat under ſhelter of the Trees that were in the Field; <hi>I</hi> began then to March towards my quarter, and as ſoon as <hi>I</hi> found <hi>I</hi> might with ſafety do it, cauſed <hi>Ceriſantes</hi> to come off, who joyned with me after a light skirmiſh, in which he loſt no body: Two of my Guardes were taken Priſoners, and one of them ran the ſame fortune with <hi>Dorillac,</hi> the other had the good luck to recover of a wound with a Sword given him behind at the Gate of <hi>Averſe,</hi> where I found him in the Hoſpital, when ſome dayes afterwards I became Maſter of that place. This skirmiſh laſted above three houres, with the loſs of four or five hundered of my men, but not above fifty or ſixty of the enemies. The death of <hi>Dorillac</hi> was alone to be lamented, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more advantage then prejudice by that of all the reſt, having diſcharged my ſelf of a great many uſeleſs and troubleſome perſons.</p>
            <p>I entered my quarter with very much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, left amongſt the Nobility a great eſteem and kindneſs for me, and found no other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the toil of this day, but an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hoarſneſs, occaſioned by the heate and duſt, and my calling out and tormenting my ſelf during my Mens diſorders. Coming to my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I was very much ſurprized to ſee <hi>Philip Prignani</hi> perfectly well, and enquiring of his wounds, he told me he had none but in his Coate, the Carabin-Bullet having miſſed his Body; finding that after this I had very little
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57207:114"/>
kindneſs for him, he was ſo aſhamed, that he ſerved no longer in his employment, neither would I have ſuffered it, which made him ſo much my enemy, that he ſought all meanes of doing me hurt, and making acquaintance with Monſieur <hi>de Fontenay,</hi> rendered me all ill Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices poſſible, going expreſsly into <hi>France,</hi> where he continued to do the ſame, till at the returne of the Fleet, after my Impriſonment, a Cannon-Bullet carrying away both his Leggs, puniſhed at once both his malice and cowardice.</p>
            <p>I was ſcarcely in my Chamber when the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs of <hi>Attaviane</hi> came to make her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, that notwithſtanding my Paſsport, her ſons had been impriſoned and pillaged at <hi>Naples,</hi> where they had been ſo farre from giving it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that they had inſolently torn and trampled it under feet: I aſſured her of Satisfaction, being my ſelf moſt concerned in it, and inſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched away the Marſhal general to take infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this action, with order to ſecure ſuch as ſhould be found faulty, cauſe what had been taken away to be reſtored, and releaſe the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and ſent one of my Guards to attend them to the enemies quarter. <hi>Michael de Santis,</hi> of whom I have formerly ſpoken, continued to qualifie himſelf Camp-maſter General, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no certain poſt, walking up and down ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by fourteen or fifteen raſcals, chanced to be in S. <hi>Anthonie</hi>'s ſuburbs, as thoſe Gentlemen paſſed, and fearing the Nobility as much as he hated them, ſince he could never expect they ſhould forgive the murther of <hi>Don Pepe Caraffa,</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:57207:114"/>
ſought all meanes of injuring them, and doing them outrages: He would not omit this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſatisfying himſelf, and my Paſſeport be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſented, tore and trampled it under his feet, ſaying, he received Orders from no man: He cauſed alſo my Marſhal to be ſecured, and his temerity making him imagine I ought to fear him, ſent back my Guard, to aſſure me, he would come the next day and give me account of his action.</p>
            <p>That night I diſpatched a Paſſeport to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant Major <hi>John Lewis Landi,</hi> to go next morning at day-break with a Trumpet, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after <hi>D' Orillac,</hi> and demand a Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for burying the Dead, and a Conference with ſome General-Officer, for regulating quarter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us; I ordered my Trumpet to make the Prince of <hi>Torella</hi> a Compliment, and Complaint in my Name, for ſlighting me, not believing there was honour to be acquired by engaging me, and therefore refuſing to exchange a Bullet when I invited him to it; but, that the eſteem I had for the gallant action I ſaw him perform, prevailing over my reſentments, obliged me to beg his friendſhip, being addicted with all care to ſeek that of perſons of courage and merit like himſelf.</p>
            <p>Next morning at my riſing Father <hi>Thomas Sebaſtian</hi> gave me account of the misfortune of ***, which ſenſibly ſtruck me; told me of the Faction that ſpread it ſelf amongſt all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the inclinations he diſcovered in them. which ſeemed very favourable, and gave me
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57207:115"/>
hope that I had begun to ſow a good ſeed, which being cultivated, would in time produce an advantageous harveſt.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>John Lewis Landi,</hi> and the Trumpet I had ſent to <hi>Averſa,</hi> being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, were a while detained without the Gates, till all things might be put in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture as was deſired might be reported to me; After which, they cauſed them to enter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them to the great Church, which was hung with mourning, and a great many Lights; All the Nobility and Officers of their Army, moſt of them in mourning Clokes, being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to aſſiſt at the Service was made for the Sieur <hi>D' Orillac,</hi> with the ſame Honours and Ceremonies that are due to the General of an Army. They all told my Trumpet, that by what they rendred to his Memory, they teſtified their ſorrow for his fatal accident, and their diſavowal of the brutal action of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that killed him in cool blood, after he had been taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner and diſarmed: Encharging him to make me a true report of what he had ſeen, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me that they would Treat with a great deal of civility all <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as belonged particularly to me, but that they muſt deal in a different manner with the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> People, who had uſed them ſo ill, and on all occaſions had ſo little reſpect for them, that they could Treat them no other wayes then as mad Dogs. That for the Ceſſation, they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conſented to it for two dayes, for burying the dead, though on their ſide there was but a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57207:115"/>
very ſmall number, and that thoſe on mine were unworthy of Sepulture; but that they in the Town, and I in my Quarter, would be two much incommoded by the corruption of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bodies, which, for the common intereſt it was convenient to lay under-ground. That for the Conference I demanded for ſetling Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they would aſſemble to take a reſolution, and return anſwer within two houres. That time being expired, they made choice of the Duke of <hi>Andria</hi> (after ſome conteſtation and difference in opinion) to confer with a general Officer on my behalf, whom they deſired me to nominate the next day, and to ſend ſome one to agree of the time and place of the conference, and how many perſons ſhould be brought on either ſide.</p>
            <p>Whil'ſt all theſe matters were regulating, I went to hear Maſs at the Church of <hi>Juliane,</hi> and the Curate coming to meet me, at the head of all the Inhabitants in Armes, and followed by all the Prieſts, preſented me a State, which I refuſed, notwithſtanding the immeaſurable ambition of which I have been accuſed, neither did I ever accept it during my being in that Kingdom, though very often offered me.</p>
            <p>At my return from Maſs they brought me a Spy, who, having paſſed through the Quarter of St. <hi>Antimo,</hi> came from thence to mine, where he was taken attentively obſerving all particulars, and having about him concealed Letters, I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be delivered to the Auditor-general, with Order, as ſoon as his proceſs ſhould be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57207:116"/>
made, to hang him by the High-way. After Dinner I took Horſe, to make uſe of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Ceſſation, for a diligent conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ground we fought on the day before: and whil'ſt I looked out at the Window in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of my Horſes, I ſaw <hi>Michael de San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> accompanied by eight or nine Perſons, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Court of my Lodging; he hardly gave himſelf the pains of ſaluting me, and alighting to come to me, was very much ſurpriſed, when at the head of the Staires the Captain of my guard Arreſted him in my Name, with two of his Companions, where making a ſhew of reſiſtance, and my guardes going about to kill him, ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by fear he wept, and ſuffered himſelf to be diſarmed with his followers: I cauſed them all to be impriſoned, himſelf in a Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with Irons on his hands and feet; I ſent immediately to examin him, cauſing the Pieces of my Paſſeport he had torne and trampled on to be preſented to him, he acknowledged his inſolence and begged his life, which I would not condeſcend to, reſerving him for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of diſobedience, and want of reſpect, and a Sacrifice to the Nobility, for acquiring their affection, by revenging the death of <hi>Dom Pepe Caraffa,</hi> whom he had ſo inhumanely murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whereof he continually boaſted. His Companions declared, that he alone, contrary to their ſenſe, had cauſed the Sons of the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Attaviane</hi> to be Arreſted; and that when they minded him of the reſpect due to my Paſs, he told them, He owed none, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57207:116"/>
none would pay me, and accompanying his inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and injurious Language with ſuitable actions, tore the Paſs and trod on it, ſwearing he would uſe me in the ſame manner if he had me in his power. Theſe things were juſtified againſt him not onely by them, but by two ſervants of the Marchioneſs of <hi>Attaviane,</hi> and the Marſhal general of the Army whom he had raſhly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted.</p>
            <p>I cauſed all the Money and Jewels had been taken from the Gentlemen to be reſtored, pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his companions, as guilty of no other crime but following him.</p>
            <p>The rancounter I had with him on the Market-place two days after my arrival, the arrogance of his words, joyned to the contempt and hatred he had expreſſed againſt me, made me judge he might probably have deſigned againſt my life, and that I might by him diſcover others that had the ſame intentions, I therefore ordered he ſhould be put on the Rack, which at firſt he ſuffered with ſome conſtancy, but it laſted not long, ere he confeſſed he had reſolved to kill me, and waited only an opportunity; that he had once failed in attempting it, And that his great averſion for me proceeded not from his affection to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but his rage againſt all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, whom he would gladly deſtroy even to the laſt man, and cut them in pieces as he had cruelly done the brother of the Duke of <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> being ſorry for his death on no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but that he had not done as much to him; That he looked on me as their Friend and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57207:117"/>
that would never ſuffer any Violence to be done them; and that this was the onely reaſon why he would have deſtroyed me, that he might afterwards have ſatisfied himſelf in what related to them. In two or three days time his Proceſs was finiſhed, and he condemned to be beheaded, his head ſet upon a Poſt, and his body hung by one foot, according to the cuſtom of puniſhing Murtherers and traitours. I cauſed his Execution to be deferred, in expectation of an occaſion of making uſe of it to the Nobility, and drawing ſome advantage from it.</p>
            <p>Returning then to the anſwer was brought me from <hi>Averſa,</hi> it obliged me to ſend back my Trumpet with the ſame <hi>Lewis Landi,</hi> to tell the Duke of <hi>Andria</hi> from me, that I had reſolved to have ſent the Baron of <hi>Modena</hi> Camp-maſter ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to conferre with ſuch as ſhould be nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by them, for the ſetling quarter betwixt us, but having with much ſatisfaction heard that he was pitched on for that treatie, I thought my ſelf not too good to meet in ſuch manner as we ſhould agree on, whoſe choice I left to him, ſo farre depending on his word, that I would come with a number of followers equal to his, to what place ſoever he pleaſed to appoint me.</p>
            <p>My civility was very well received, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with all imaginable gallantry. But fearing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might prevent this interview, which, if they got notice of it, would give them a great deal of jealouſie, and looking upon it as very neceſſary to the execution of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, I ordered the ſaid <hi>Landi,</hi> to a gree of the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57207:117"/>
Cloyſter of the Capuchins of <hi>Averſa,</hi> equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Town and my Quarter, that either ſide ſhould bring for their ſecurity one hundred and fifty horſe, and two hundred Muſquettiers, to guard the avenues; and that they ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Courts of Guard and Sentries to prevent ſurpriſal: that the troops of neither ſide ſhould come nearer the place where we were than five hundred paces. That each of us would come with our Swords and Piſtols, and accompanied by ten perſons, with an adjutant for carrying orders to our men, when it ſhould be neceſſary for them to advance or retreat, as we ſhould judge it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; that neither ſide ſhould bring above a dozen Lacquies for holding the horſes, and that we would meet the eighteenth of <hi>December</hi> at two in the afternoon at the appointed place. Many Gentlemen deſirous of ſeeing me were Competitors for accompanying the Duke of <hi>Andria,</hi> and after many Conteſtations the lot fell on <hi>Don Fabritio Spinell, Don Scipio Pignatelli, Don Carlo Caetano, Carlo Marullo</hi> a Knight of <hi>Malta, Don Caeſar de la Marra, Joſeph Papalette</hi> Captain of Horſe, <hi>John Jacob Affati</hi> Baron of <hi>Canoſa, Don Franciſco de Taſſis</hi> a Spaniſh Knight, and the Adjutant General <hi>Battimiello.</hi> I brought with me the Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> Camp-maſter ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the <hi>Sieur de Ceriſantes,</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade, Auguſtin de Lieto</hi> Captain of my Guards, <hi>Antonio Tonti</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Sieur Deſſinar</hi> of <hi>Avignon, Onoffrio Piſſacany, Jomo</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Apollina</hi> Maſter of my Horſe, <hi>Cicio Batti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miello, Aniello de Falco</hi> General of the Artillery,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57207:118"/>
and <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> to carry my orders, as my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutant general.</p>
            <p>The day being come of my obtaining that which I had moſt paſſionately deſired ever ſince my entrance into <hi>Naples,</hi> that I might in perſon found the thoughts of the Nobility, and face to face employ the beſt of my addreſſes for winning them to me, I prepared my ſelf with as much joy as hope, that this conference could not fail of a good effect: for I ſhould either gain them by my Civilities and Arguments, or raiſe ſuch a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of them in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as to cauſe them by diſtruſt and other ill uſage in time to force them to have recourſe to me, and caſt themſelves into my ams. I ſent for the two Officers I had taken at the laſt skirmiſh, and whom I had uſed very civilly, and after I had commended their valour, and teſtified an eſteem for them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them to take entertaiment with me, tempting them by great promiſes of advantage, but they anſwering that the fidelity of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> had been ever inviolable, and that they would die in ſervice of the King whoſe Subjects they were born, I told them that as I muſt needs love them the leſs, I could not but eſteem them the more, that it was but juſt that having been made Priſoners by my hand, they ſhould receive the advantages of my Courteſie, that they were at Liberty, and might return, and cauſing their arms and horſes to be given them again with ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I ordered them to be accompanied by a trumpet, who was to give me notice when the Duke of <hi>Andria</hi> took horſe, that I might come to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57207:118"/>
our rendezvous at the ſame time with him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſpoſed him to more willingneſs for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us quarter, by the example I had given of Civility to Priſoners of War. Thoſe men thinking they could never ſufficiently extol my bounty, ſpoke ſo much of it, that all their troops were readie to disband for my ſervice.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I ſent to view all about the <hi>Capuchins</hi> for fear of an ambuſh, and to viſit care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully their Cloyſter: I drew out all my forces both Horſe and Foot at the head of my Quarter, ſecured all paſſages that were favourable to my retreat, and kept my ſelf ready to march with the number agreed on, at the firſt news ſhould be brought me. It was not long before they came, and marching within a thouſand paces of the place of our Conference, I halted, and ſent to viſit thoſe Gentlemen, who doing the ſame to us, and being aſſured of the integrity of each other, we met, our Guards ſtaying at the diſtance agreed on betwixt us.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Andria</hi> alighted when he came within thirty paces, I did the ſame, and we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with open arms, and after many em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces and teſtimonies of eſteem and affection, He preſented to me thoſe that accompanied him, as I cauſed him to be ſaluted by all that followed me: After which he expreſſed his joy to have been made choice of for this Conference, and his obligation to me, for coming in perſon in ſtead of ſending, which was an honour he received as he ought; and of which all his life he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the memory with gratitude. I anſwered
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57207:119"/>
that underſtanding his birth and merit I neither could nor ought to do leſs, being very well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the antiquity and grandeur of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Caraffa,</hi> whoſe chief he was, and whoſe ſplendour he ſupported by his courage and virtue, and many other perfections which acquired him a general eſteem; that I with Paſſion coveted his friendſhip, and came expreſsly to beg it; He added that his curioſity for knowing my perſon had been ſatisfied two days before, when I was ſo near him with my Sword in my hand, that he eaſily then obſerved all the lineaments of my face, that honour might have been acquired by coming nearer me, but that I was ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an enemy, that his curioſity could not be ſatisfied without difficulty and extreme danger; That he had ſeen me do things ſo extraordinay, that there was no need of asking my name, ſince all the Nobility concurred with him, that it muſt neceſſarily be I, no other perſon in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable alone to continue a combat, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned (as he in the high way had thrice ſeen me) by all my troops in confuſion, without any paſſion remarkable in me but an Extraordinary fierceneſs againſt a great body of Horſe that came upon me, and indignation not to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. That if I were at the head of men gallant enough to accompany me in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers I led them to, he believed I ſhould find nothing difficult, nor that any force could be capable of reſiſting my courage. That he could not ſee me ſo ill ſeconded without ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, that he had given me ſome teſtimony of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57207:119"/>
reſpect and affection, when to prevent my death or Impriſonment (one of which could not have been avoided) I might have obſerved he came to the head of his Troops and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to halt, that they might not ſo fiercely engage themſelves againſt me.</p>
            <p>To a Diſcourſe of ſo much Gallantry I reply'd, that my reſpect for all the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Nobility had like to have coſt me dear, becauſe it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my ambition of gaining their love and eſteem that gave me courage and boldneſs, then the blood derived from my Anceſtors; and that I ſhould have been aſhamed, if at my firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance amongſt them, my Face had not been as eaſie to have been remarked as my Perſon. That the Example of what I ſaw ſo handſomely done by them, obliged me to imitate it, that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy might produce ſome kind of inclination for me. That I well perceived how he had ſought to oblige me, and acknowledged it, with deſire to preſerve its memory all the dayes of my life, though I was in no very great danger, being well ſeconded by my foot, as, to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, I had made appear to the coſt of ſome of his Comerades. To which, replying, That he was ſorry to ſee me at the head of a Rabble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of ſuch a Leader, whoſe virtues equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized his birth, and that deſerved to be better followed: I anſwered with a great ſigh, That I might eaſily be ſo, if himſelf, with the reſt of the Nobility, would reſolve to ſee me fight for their Liberty, and employ my life to deliver them from the Chaines they bore, too heavy to be ſuffered
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57207:120"/>
any longer: Perſons of their quality and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage not being borne to die ſlaves, but live with ſuch Honour, Advantages, and Prerogatives, as Heaven deſigned them to, in giving them ſo illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious extractions. He replyed, It was their Glory to ſpend their lives for the ſervice of a King, whoſe Subjects they were borne: that their fidelity made the Empire of their maſter eaſie, and that no yoke can be heavy that is born with pleaſure, and without regret; that they could not ſpend their lives better then in the chaſtiſement of a Rout of infamous Rebels, that endeavoured to ſhake a Crown, of which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour obliged all Gentlemen to be the ſupporters, and himſelf as the moſt zealous to give example to the reſt.</p>
            <p>I ſaw we engaged our ſelves too far for a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſcourſe, and hoping a more eaſie diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his thoughts in particular, making a ſign to thoſe of my Retinue to entertain his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I propoſed to him to go into the Church, where after our Prayers, we ſate down on a Bench, and began a converſation more free and more important: He told me, that with tears of blood, he lamented to ſee a Perſon, for whom he had already his heart ſo poſſeſſed with affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſteem and reſpect (of a Family not only illuſtrious, but deſcending from their ancient Kings, which obliged him to a particular venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for me, whoſe Anceſtors had ſupported the Catholick Religion in <hi>France,</hi> and by ſo many great and famous actions, acquired the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all Europe, that inheriting their
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57207:120"/>
eminent Virtues, did not onely imitate, but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs them in all endowments, ſo bountifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him by Heaven) expoſed to ſo many dangers for ſupporting the Intereſts of a revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People, Rebellious, Inconſtant, ungrateful, treacherous and cruel, that recompenced the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices done them by blood and Maſſacres, of which the Prince of <hi>Maſſa</hi> was an unfortunate exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that he ſhould in a ſingle Felucca paſs through a potent Fleet, diſdaining Tempeſts, and the fortune of the Sea in ſo dangerous a ſeaſon, purſued by ſo many Gallies, and other Veſſels with Ores, prepared for his deſtruction, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf in a place where he was to venture his life and honour, in queſt of a death as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as full of ſhame and infamy, unſeconded by a Fleet, abandoned by all but his virtue and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, without any one Man in whom to confide, or capable of eaſing or executing his high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, having Forces ſo conſiderable to oppoſe him, that the apprehenſion was able to make the moſt reſolute tremble, and whoſe adventures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled more the actions of ſome deſpairing wretch, then of a generous and ambitious Prince. That he could not think of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſorrow; that he conjured me to make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflexion, and without prejudice conſider, what I had to fear and hope. He told me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, That he perceived I flattered my ſelf with a hope of drawing the Nobility to me, which I ought not to expect; that it was true, there was not any of them that had not great eſteem, reſpect, and kindneſs for me, or
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57207:121"/>
that did not hold himſelf obliged to me for putting an end to the burning and plundering their Houſes, and protecting them ſince my arrival from the inſolencies and outrages of the Common People, or that did not attribute to my care the preſervation of what remained of their Eſtates, Relations, and the Honour of their Families, for which they would never prove ingrateful: but, that all things conſidered, I had no intereſt in this Affair, having no other ſhare but what my Command of their Forces whom I ſerved gave me, of whom I was not Maſter, <hi>Gennaro</hi> being the head, whom perſons of quality would never own: that he thought me too generous to pretend to adviſe them to it, and that they had too much vanity to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Peaſants they had till then alwayes trampled on: That this were not to acquire liberty, but become ſlaves to the meaneſt of the multitude, whoſe hands (with ſorrow and reſentment) they yet ſaw reeking with the blood of their Relations, the revenge whereof had been as certain as ready, if my arrival, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and conduct had not retarded the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the courage and reſolution I made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſupporting ſo ill a cauſe. That their Births and Honours rendring them the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the Crown of <hi>Naples,</hi> obliged them to continue their fidelity to all extremities: That I might judge of their zeal by their having formed an Army at their own charge, and carryed on the War without fear of expoſing their Families and Fortunes to the rage of the Rebels. That
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57207:121"/>
they gloried in ſpending to their laſt peny, and ſhedding to their laſt drop of bloud, to preſerve the Crown to their King and Maſter, though (to deal freely with me) they expected no other recompence than the ſatisfaction to have complied with their duty, it being moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſacrifice all, after having been ſo ill uſed and little conſidered, as they had hitherto been by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not expecting ſo much as thanks for what they did ſo frankly, and with their to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ruine, but that it was enough for them, to let all <hi>Europe</hi> ſee, that they had conſumed their Eſtates and hazarded their perſons to ſave a Kingdom whoſe deſtruction they might have beheld without crime, by not oppoſing the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, nor applying themſelves to more than the defence of their lands and preſervation of their fortunes.</p>
            <p>To conclude, that they were ſorry to ſee me every hour of the day in danger of my life, either by poiſon, aſſaſſination, or treaſon. That it would prove impoſſible for me to overcome alone ſuch oppoſitions as would daily ariſe; That I was not to depend on a people void of courage and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who, as they had done but two dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would ever abandon me, on all occaſions of warre; That queſtionleſs a falſe account of the peoples forces had been given me at <hi>Rome,</hi> or I had not come to their ſervice; but that he doubted not that having diſcovered ſuch mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious artifices as were made uſe of to engage me, I had a hundred times repented to have ſo eaſily caſt my ſelf into the middeſt of ſo infamous a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57207:122"/>
rabble. That I ought to conſider that upon the firſt ill ſucceſs, for which (according to their cuſtome) they would make me reſponſible, or at the firſt ſedition incited by ſome fool or mad man, whoſe credit ſhould cry louder than that of others, they would cut off my head, and dragge me through the Streets; That he very well knew that in two or three rancounters they had already loſt their reſpect to me, and though I then found a remedy in reſolution and courage, I ſhould not perhaps have alwayes the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune though the ſame heart, and whenſoever ſhe failed me, I ſhould infallibly looſe both my life and honour. That he came expreſsly to repreſent all theſe things to me in the name of the Nobility, and to offer me (in caſe I reſolved to retire to <hi>Rome</hi>) to accompany me in a body thither: that as my Servant he adviſed me to this reſolution, ſince I could not nor ought not to fancy any eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment by the people, capable only of tumults and ſeditions: Revolutions of Monarchies, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of Governments being effected by the Nobility, who could never be favourable to the hopes wherewithal I perhaps flattered my ſelf, my obligation to and dependance on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, preventing their uniting with me, who on my part would not think my ſelf beholding to them for my eſtabliſhment, whoſe firſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been layed by the people. I began with my thanks for, the good Counſels he gave me, as well in the Nobilities name as his own, which yet I had no inclination to follow, neither could I do it with reaſon and honour: I told him alſo
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57207:122"/>
that I hoped he had ſo good an opinion of me that he did not expect it; that I had not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted ſo hazardous a paſſage, to looſe the glory it acquired me, and make that ſeem an action of imprudence, which I had undertaken with ſo much honour and reſolution. That I found nothing in <hi>Naples</hi> that ſurprized me. That I foreſaw all the dangers to which I expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſelf, and fancied greater difficulties than I had met withal. That honor cannot be obtained without danger, that my Paſſion for the ſervice of the Crown to which I was born a ſubject, armed me againſt all. That I had calmely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all the good and evil ſucceſſes of fortune, and ſought all means of advancing the one and remedying the other, and that caſting into one ſcale the honour and glory I ſhould acquire, and into the other all manner of dangers I was to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, I found my ſelf ſo animated and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in my deſigns, that nothing in the world was capable of making me forſake them. That I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged not ſo lightly as he might imagine; That if I had alone in a <hi>felucca</hi> croſſed through the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, and contemned ſuch perils as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other might with reaſon have apprehended, it was not that like a fabulous Knight errant, I thought to defend a people againſt ſuch puiſſant forces by Land and Sea as I was to combat, and alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer a great Kingdom, but having been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the people of <hi>Naples</hi> were diſcouraged, I thought good to enter to animate them, and gain time for the arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, with all ſuccours neceſſary not onely for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57207:123"/>
of the Town, but for driving the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> out of the whole Kingdom, which I thought ſpeedily to effect. In a word (I told him) I had provided for all things; a potent Fleet was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and at preſent under ſail to attend my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whoſe arrival the Winds alone were able to retard, you will ſee it, ſaid I, very ſuddenly ſink and burn that of <hi>Spain,</hi> it is furniſhed with all things neceſſary, whereas the other is intirely unprovided. It convoys me ſhips laden with Corn, Ammunition, Artillery and Money: it brings a great body of foot that I may land ſuch numbers as I ſhall think neceſſary: and a great many horſemen, whom when I have mounted, nothing can prevent my being maſter of the Field, I am willing to give you and the reſt of the Nobility notice of this, that you may perceive I am not chimerical, and that without vanity I may boaſt, to be ready to give the Law, and not receive it. I am ſorry for your blindneſs that provide not for your ſelves, and fear, if you open not your eyes to ſeek your ſecurity, leaſt you be irreparably involved in the ruine of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Do not fancy that I endeavour to engage you on precipices, I love you too well. I would have you make reflexions, but neither reſolve nor execute, till you ſee all that I have told you made good. If you continue united to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the Forces of <hi>France</hi> joyning with the people will declare againſt you; the Eſtabliſhment of a popular Republick may be taken into conſideration, which will trouble you, and being once excluded you will never recover
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57207:123"/>
the Rank and Authority you may now reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expect. You may anſwer me that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this project is very difficult as long as you oppoſe it: which I ſhall grant you, and more, that poſſibly you may prevent it: but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done without great effuſion of bloud, the deſtruction of your families and ruine of your eſtates, with the deſolation of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which you will make a Stage of war per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for many ages, whereas reuniting both the bodies of the State in the ſame intereſt, as it is unnatural for them to be divided, liberty and enfranchiſement from the tyrannous dominion of <hi>Spain</hi> will be the work but of a few weeks: And as you are to receive greater advantages by it then the common people, it is but reaſon that you take your ſhare of the pains and travel, neither would it be honourable for you to leave them all the glorie that you might acquire all the profit; In ſuch a caſe none but my ſelf would have any thing to pretend, having the command of their Forces in my hand, which I will ſhare with you now, that I may do the ſame hereafter by ſuch advantages of fortune as will follow it. Do not imagine that I would by this perſwade you to caſt your ſelves at their feet, I hate the multitude too much, and love perſons of quality too well to be capable of ſuch a thought. If the authority of <hi>Gennaro</hi> offend you, you ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be rid of him, for I give you my word that at my return to <hi>Naples</hi> I will take it from him, and you ſhall underſtand it to be wholly in my hands; I promiſe you that I will
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57207:124"/>
not be there eight days before you ſhall hear that I am maſter, and no orders but mine ſpoken of: Matters are ſo well diſpoſed towards this, that no man is in a condition to oppoſe it; I have ſo farre gained the affection of the better ſort, and am ſo much feared by the vulgar, that I am more abſolute than you formerly ſaw <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niello.</hi> When affairs ſhall be in this condition, if you think good to have recourſe to me, you ſhall alwayes find me ready with open arms to receive you, with all manner of ſervices and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of eſteem and friendſhip; and to remove all unwillingneſs, know that I am an enemy to diſorder, inſolence, and tumult; that I will cauſe them to ceaſe, and re-eſtabliſh repoſe and juſtice, cauſe to be given to perſons of Quality the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that ſuits with them, and hold the vulgar in ſuch contempt, ſubjection and dependance as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it, and in which it was ever held before the revolutions. I will puniſh all Incendiaries, and ſuch as are accuſtomed to plundering houſes, I will ſacrifice to the reſentments of their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all ſuch as have dipped their hands in the bloud of the Gentry, to put a beginning to which I keep in irons <hi>Michael de Santis,</hi> who cruelly maſſacred <hi>Don Pepe Caraffa</hi>; I will ſacrifice him to you and your family, and before ſix dayes are over, you ſhall ſee his head on a Poſt at the gate of <hi>Averſa,</hi> and his body hung by one foot on a tree on the High-way ſide. Theſe are the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies I will give you of my credit and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well as of my affection for the Nobility, and the deſign I have of ſeeking your good will,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57207:124"/>
by rendring you all manner of ſervice; hoping withal when you ſhall ſee ſo many things ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected more for your intereſt than mine own, you will conſider your condition and prevent your being involved in the ruine of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and labour, as prudence ſhall require, to make your advantages by them.</p>
            <p>Afterwards I told him that I commended his zeal and fidelity for <hi>Spain,</hi> though it would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly be rewarded with ingratitude, that they might aſſure themſelves all ſervices they did for her would be reputed as crimes, becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Politicks of her Miniſters would oblige her to deſtroy thoſe ſhe could not recompence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their merits, and whoſe reſentments ſhe muſt afterwards fear, which would reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly draw on her hatred and ingratitude. That it was much eaſier to cauſe the ruine of a Kingdom than to preſerve and maintain it againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Heaven and general Revolutions, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not run a hazard of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the humours of the Nobility, who might at their pleaſure deprive them of the Crown they had with ſo much Generoſity and Courage ſupported; That they knew very well there was not any that had not been ſtabbed in his boſom, and highly outraged by their injurious uſage. That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not think themſelves obliged by their arming, nor aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen bling ſo conſiderable troops for them, which had hitherto prevented their being driven away, and preſerved them all their Garriſons; that all this would be attributed to their hatred againſt
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57207:125"/>
the common people, and revenge for their inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in plundering their houſes, and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bloud of their Relations ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſpilled. In a word, that the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> fears all, and is obliged by nothing, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes but never rewards; looks on all as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies whoſe power gives jealouſie, apprehends Revolutions, and ſtudies to deſtroy all that are capable of making them, and out of its natural diſtruſt applies it ſelf to prevent thoſe it takes to be in a condition to do hurt, if they have a mind: That I was ſorry to ſee all the Nobility in this danger, and him as moſt powerful and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, more than any other. That he was to underſtand he ſhould make himſelf criminal by great and generous actions, and that his ruine as well as that of all his Companions was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable, becauſe they ſhould either be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly involved in that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or moſt certainly deſtroy themſelves in ſettling the others affairs, and re-eſtabliſhing their authority, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being able to ſecure them againſt their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt and ſeverity; That no faults were venial with them; that whatſoever gives them jealouſie (often raiſed on no foundation) they call deſign and treaſon; that they ſhould be looked on as more guilty than the revolted people, by oppoſing their inſolencies, and endeavouring, as they did, to ſettle the general diſorders of the Kingdom, &amp; prevent its total ſubverſion. That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſſimulation was too well underſtood to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in, and that after many fair words and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious appearances, the time would come when
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57207:125"/>
they ſhould feel the effects of their cruel Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes, without knowing how to avoid them.</p>
            <p>He reliſhed all my Arguments, and could do no leſs then yield to them; anſwering that he had very well conſidered all I had ſo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly repreſented, but that he would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as he had begun, and even to death comply with his obligations: the greateſt you have, ſaid I is, the preſervation of your Country, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting it from final ruine, and the whole Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and your own particular Family from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſerably: and you will be blameable to eternity; if having it in your power to prevent ſo many miſchiefs as threaten you, you obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw on your head Famine, War, Murthers, Conflagrations and Plunderings, and ſo become the deſtroyer of your Country, when you may make your ſelf the reſtorer. You began not the inſurrection, but not being able to allay it, you ought to make uſe of it for procuring repoſe and liberty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> alone will be blamed for this Revolution, their injuſt and violent conduct ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving acquired the general hatred of the People, and their negligence and weakneſs depriving them of the meanes to ſecure themſelves from their reſentments, ſo that you abandon them not till they had firſt abandoned themſelves and you, to the violence and brutality of a deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multitude. Are you obliged to impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the behalf of thoſe who have ſuffered themſelves to be over-powered for want of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57207:126"/>
and precaution againſt a miſchief, one may ſay they wilfully pulled on their own heads, ſince after ſo many reiterated advices, they would not change their conduct? Can you alwayes maintain at your own charge the Troops you have raiſed in a War that probably may laſt long? You will ſoon be exhauſted, receiving no rents from your Lands, which I ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have a power to ſecure from ſpoiling, nor your houſes from demoliſhing, when ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate againſt all reaſon, and contrary to your own Intereſts, you ſhall continue in Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me: and when neceſſity ſhall compel you to lay them down, you will be undone, and become inconſiderable to each party, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a condition to aſſiſt, nor prejudice. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent by prudence this inevitable inconvenience, by which you will loſe your reputation and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. I demand not your joyning with me, it would not become you to do it ſo lightly, nor me to propoſe it, ſince I have a particular care of your honour. I would have you firſt ſee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what I have promiſed: you will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do well to go every one home for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your Eſtates, and gain time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the courſe of Affaires, and make uſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> them to your advantage. I ſhall have great cauſe of ſatisfaction in you, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> none of Complaint, when you let them know, you have done all that was poſſible for them; that you have raiſed and maintained Forces at your own charge, which for want of Money you can no longer keep together; That you
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57207:126"/>
go home to endeavour to raiſe more, and ſeek to preſerve that little of your Fortunes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, having ſpent the reſt in their Service. I will not only give you ſafeguards, but the Command of your Towns to ſuch as you ſhall nominate; ſince under the Conſtellation that now predominates, the ſmalleſt Village muſt have a Captain and make War. I will prevent all talke of a Republick, till ſuch time as you ſhall be in a capacity of entering upon that part of the Government that belongs to you, and of giving your opinion for the manner of eſtabliſhing it.</p>
            <p>My opinion ſaid he (and all the Nobilities) is, that a Republique being no wayes ſuitable to us, we neither can, nor ought to hearken to it; we will never ſuffer the People to ſhare the Authority with us; and we are naturally of an humour ſo turbulent and vain-glorious, that it is impoſſible for us to look one upon another in an equality of power.</p>
            <p>There will infallibly ariſe Diviſions, Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and hatreds, to the ruine of the Country: We are born under Monarchy, and cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without a King; A Soveraign Authority muſt be Guardian of our repoſe and quiet, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie our Diſſentions, and reconcile our Enmities, to this Nature and Education incline us, which ſuppoſed, we muſt of neceſſity reſolve to loſe our lives and fortunes, for continuing us under our Kings Authority how violent ſoever, we are habituated to it, and believe that of <hi>France</hi> would not be more moderate, and that we
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57207:127"/>
ſhould not gain, but might poſſibly loſe by the Exchange: We ſhall ſtill ſee our Countrey at the feet of ſtrangers, our Employments, Offices, and the Government of our Towns and Provinces in their hands, our VVealth will as formerly be tranſported into another Countrey, which will be enriched by our Impoveriſhment, and we ſhall ſtill be enforced to Court and kneel to a Vice-roy, of no greater birth than our ſelves. By this you may perceive we ſhall no wayes better our condition; beſides, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> humor ſuites more with ours, the <hi>French</hi> being too airy for People ſerious and jealous as we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are.</p>
            <p>I replyed, That he had no reaſon to diſtruſt <hi>France,</hi> who contributed her aſſiſtance and power to give the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> liberty, without other intereſt then the Glory of ſucco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the oppreſſed, as ſhe had done to the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> that had recourſe to her Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and deprive her Enemies of a Crown from whence they derived the beſt of thoſe Forces that reſiſted her Victorious Armes:. That the King two well underſtood his Intereſts to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be their Maſter, by which he might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly incurr their hatred, but moſt certainly the jealouſie of all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who would on that account enter into a League againſt him, ſo as he ſhould by it draw great inconveniences on himſelf without any advantage; That doing the contrary, he ſhould win the hearts of all, as well Nobility as People, by driving away their common Enemy, and afterwards leaving them to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57207:127"/>
the liberty of chuſing ſuch a Maſter as ſhould beſt pleaſe them, if it be ſo that they cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one, who ſhould be obliged to depend on him for his ſupport, ſo that their common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſhould alwayes unite their Naval Power, which would be in a condition to ſubdue that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> enfeebled by all acceſſions that had been made to <hi>France</hi>; and to take from the whole Kingdom the diſtruſt they might have of ſo potent Succors, the Fleet ſhould alwayes lie ready to attempt whatſoever I ſhould judge advantageous, without landing any thing, or any man till I demanded it; that this was the Order wherewith I had a particular charge to acquaint them: ſo that himſelf and all his friends ought to be ſatisfied and perſwaded, that if they muſt change Maſter, it ſhould be for no other then ſuch as themſelves made choice of, which might be one of their own body, if ſuch a one could be found, for whom the reſt of the Nobility had eſteem enough, to obey him without repining: That if they deſired a ſtranger, we had two Princes in <hi>France,</hi> one the Kings Uncle, moſt diſcreet and prudent, who loving repoſe, would be very ſollicitous to preſerve it to them; the other his Brother, yet a Child, of great hopes, who by being bred amongſt them, and ſeaſoned with the humors and cuſtomes of their Country, it would be as if they formed a King after their own Model, which is no ſmall advantage. That if any particular reaſon thwarted their choice of one of theſe Princes, <hi>Italy,</hi> or at leaſt the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> might preſent others; and that whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57207:128"/>
they ſet on their Throne, ſhould be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, approved, and aſſiſted by <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He told me, There was no need of ſeeking them a Maſter, ſince they had one already, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom they hoped to continue, and to which end they would ſpare no endeavours; but if any of the Nobility ſhould be convinced by my reaſons, which he acknowledged to be powerful, he would not be the firſt in ſuch a compliance, nor till it ſhould be made apparent to all the VVorld, that he was compelled to it by inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity, as being out of condition of doing otherwiſe. That if they muſt reſolve to ſubmit themſelves to another, it could be to none of their own Country, ſince every man would in ſuch a caſe pretend, not as believing himſelf to merit it, but that he might not give place to any of his Companions, whoſe exaltation he would never ſuffer. For the two Princes I had propounded, they were no wayes proper for them, the firſt being incommoded with the Gout, and of little activity, they ſtanding in need of a Prince vigilant and vigorous, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the liberty he ſhould acquire them: for the other, beſides that he was too young to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne them, the King his Brother dying without children, or they failing, they muſt become uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> the onely thing they feared, nothing being capable to make them take Armes contrary to their duty, but the hope of freeing their Crown from dependance on any other. He told me afterwards, That they had no great inclination for the Princes of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57207:128"/>
that they ſhould rather make choice of a meer ſtranger, the gallantry of whoſe actions had acquired their eſteem and affection; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered nothing to this Diſcourſe, it being too complaiſant and flattering. After this he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me if the Credit I had amongſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gave me any hopes, and whether I thought the Crown of <hi>Naples</hi> might ever depend on their ſupport, favour, or election: if ſo, that I extreamly miſtook, becauſe the Nobility would periſh in oppoſal of all their determinations, would never have dependance on them, nor ſubmit to the Authority of a man, that ſhould owe his Fortune to them, and might believe himſelf obliged to them for it.</p>
            <p>I anſwered him, That my ambition was too moderate for ſo high imaginations, that I was not ſo vain to flatter my ſelf with expectation of a Dignity I was unable to ſupport. That I would not ſo expoſe my ſelf to fortune, whoſe inconſtancy I too much apprehended, neither was I deſirous to mount to a height, a fall from whence might coſt my honour and life, or, where the laſt of theſe being preſerved to me by an extraordinary effect, I muſt paſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of it in eternal ſhame and ſorrow; but if, (contrary to my expectation,) <hi>I</hi> ſhould ever attain any advantage, I would receive it from none but the Nobility, that I might owe it to them, and be by it engaged to uſe my uttermoſt endeavour to reſtore them to their wonted ſplendor, and the Vulgar to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance and ſubjection wherein God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57207:129"/>
had placed them, and reaſon required they ſhould continue. That I would endeavour to revenge them of all outrages had been done them, and ſeverely and exemplarily puniſh the Authors. To conclude, that I would pretend to nothing high and glorious, but by the Duke of <hi>Andria,</hi> to whom only I would be obliged; that, if I ever came to attain the firſt place in his Country, the ſecond might be his, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with him and his friends all Honors, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Profits, and Governments of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>He returned me his thanks, but aſſured me, That he neither believed, nor wiſhed matters ſhould ever come to ſuch a paſs, perſwading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf I ſhould never get Forces ſufficient to drive away the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that he doubted not but that the Nobility had enow, as well as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient courage and fidelity, to preſerve to the King their Maſter a Crown he had inherited from his Anceſtors, and to which Heaven and their Duty had made them Subjects.</p>
            <p>I beſought him, conſidering the inclination I had to do them all manner of Services, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with their reſolution, in caſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity compelled them to take any, and I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give him notice of the arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and the ſupplies I expected; and when I ſhould have deprived of all Authority <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and the other heads of the People, who were ſo odious to them, and taken on my ſelf the management of all Affairs, to remove the difficulties that interpoſed betwixt them and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57207:129"/>
their intereſts: and after a thouſand Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of friendſhip, and as many embraces we went out of the Church to meet the company, where we returned to a Converſation leſs ſerious and more gallant.</p>
            <p>I asked him in preſence of all thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if the brave Cavaleer I remarked in the skirmiſh two days ago were not the Prince of <hi>Torello,</hi> whoſe Gallantry gave me a great eſteem for him, yet againſt whom I thought I had ſome cauſe of complaint, becauſe of his refuſal to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change a Bullet with me, when I invited him to it, as if he thought there had not been honor enough to have been acquired in that ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contre.</p>
            <p>He told me, it was the Prince of <hi>Minorvine</hi> who had beſought him to make me his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and excuſes, for not accepting a combat that would have been ſo glorious to him: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that he had already fired both his Piſtols, his unwillingneſs to engage me by reaſon of the approach of his Troops (whom he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain,) and the Cowardice of mine (who in ſtead of ſuſtaining the ſhock would undoubtedly have fled and abandoned me, as he had ſeen them do before) forced him to refuſe the honour I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prounded, by which I ſo highly obliged him that he ſhould never looſe the memorie but remain my ſervant all the days of his life I received this Complement with ſuch acknowledgements as its gallantry merited, and beſought him to tell him in my name that he very much obliged me, and that I thought I had eſcaped a very great danger,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57207:130"/>
it being in my opinion extremely hazardous to encounter a perſon of his Valour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Fabritio Spinelli</hi> ſaw amongſt my Horſes a gray Courſer he very much eſteemed, and that had been taken out of one of his Houſes by ſome Troops that ſerved the <hi>People,</hi> I offered to reſtore him, which he would not accept, ſeeming very well ſatisfied, that he was in my hands: And the Duke of <hi>Andria</hi> told me that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> being naturally diſtruſtful, would have been jealous of his receiving ſuch a courteſie from me. He looked on a bay Horſe of mine as very ſuitable to a Set of Coach-horſes he had of the ſame height and colour, which I offered and he refuſed for the ſame reaſon his Camerade had done the other: and I commending a dapeled gray of his breed, on which he came, he very much preſſed me to accept him, I thanked him, but would not propound a truck with mine, to which he would have been willing, becauſe it came in my head to ſend it to him the next Morning, which I did by a Trumpet, with the other to <hi>Don Fabritio Spinelli,</hi> who returned them with this Meſſage, that I did not treat them as my Friends and Servants, becauſe there was as much malice as generoſity in the preſent I went about to make them, and it looked as if I intended to raiſe a jealouſie of them, ſo to compel them, out of apprehenſion of the danger to which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them, to ſeek their ſafety with me.</p>
            <p>Many obliging Diſcourſes were made on each ſide, after which, the night approaching cauſed us to ſeparate; I perceived that by this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57207:130"/>
I had gained much on their inclination and friendſhip, which might in time produce good effects. And though the principal cauſe of it was to ſettle quarter betwixt our Forces, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely forbore ſpeaking one word of it, to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the greater jealouſie of ſo long and ſecret a conference, where nothing was mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the ſubject that cauſed it to be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; this punctually ſucceeded as I imagined: and thoſe Gentlemen returned ſo well ſatisfied with me, that they expreſſed it to all the reſt of the Nobility in terms ſo obliging and affectionate, that it was out of queſtion that I had won their hearts.</p>
            <p>At my return I heard the joyful news of the arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, the more acceptable in that it had been reported, that the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, which I ſaw before my eyes, the day before my departure, breake in pieces two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> veſſels in the road of <hi>Naples,</hi> had ſcattered and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral of our Ships. The people were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at its appearance, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as much ſurpriſed, who expected it not, taking it at firſt for ſupplies ſent to them, and which they every day looked for.</p>

important and eaſie attempt was not made, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could never have recovered; but this I can ſay, that in the time of my impriſonment they acknowledged they never were ſo near ruine, which they could not have avoided if ours had come on: all that were aboard our Fleet grant this, yet none can alledge a reaſon or excuſe for this fault, nor can tell to what to attribute it.</p>
            <p>The next Morning at my riſing, the Abbot <hi>Baſqui</hi> came to me, and having delivered all the diſpatches he had for me, which aſſured me of the ſatisfaction, the news of my paſſage had given the Court, and that in Confirmation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes I had made to the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> of the protection and powerful aſſiſtance of <hi>France,</hi> the Fleet was ſent to ſupply us with whatſoever we ſhould deſire, and land whatever we ſhould have occaſion for, whither Men or Ammunition; he at laſt proffered me the account of what he brought along: and coming to particulars, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him with what Money we ſhould be ſupplied, and deſired that ſome body might be landed to take charge of it in the Kings name, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it according to my Orders, aſſuring him that it ſhould be managed with all care, and that I would not ſuffer any unprofitable expence to be made. He told me there were five hundered thouſand Livers, but that not being able to touch at <hi>Genoua</hi> to receive it, they had onely the Bills of Exchange, ſo that I was to take it upon my credit in <hi>Naples,</hi> and that it ſhould be punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reimburſed at <hi>Genoua</hi> on ſight. I anſwered
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57207:131"/>
that what he propounded was uſeleſs, becauſe in a Citie where diſorder had ſo long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, all men had concealed and hid their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and that, had it been poſſible to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered any, I ſhould have made an advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſe of it, and the Fleet have found me in a much better condition, that we muſt therefore immediately diſpatch away ſome ſhips to fetch it, becauſe it was the thing the moſt neceſſary, and of which we had greateſt want. Then I asked if they had brought any Corn, he told me no, but that order was left to lade ſome Veſſels in <hi>Provence</hi> which would ſuddenly arrive, and in ſuch manner that we ſhould have enough: I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked what foot they could land us, and he told me as many as I ſhould deſire, I demanded ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, he thought it too many. I reduced my ſelf to four, afterwards to three, then to two thouſand five hundered; and two thouſand; at laſt I fell to eighteen hundred, on which number we agreed, and which he ſaid might be landed without disfurniſhing the Fleet. I expected a good number of horſemen to mount in <hi>Naples,</hi> but I was fain to content my ſelf with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Queens Guards, which had formerly belonged to the Duke of <hi>Breze,</hi> and that of <hi>Monſieur de Manicamp,</hi> there being no other perſons fit to be employed on horſeback.</p>
            <p>I had demanded fourſcore thouſand weight of Powder, but was fain to be content with fourty, which were promiſed me with Match and Bullet proportionable. I had alſo deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Pikes and Muskets for Foot, Sadles, Bridles
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57207:132"/>
and Piſtols for two thouſand horſe, but would have abated one half. And whether it were they had not time to ſhip them, or had forgot them, they told me they had brought none. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to land me ten Pieces of Ordnance. At laſt having acquainted the Abbot <hi>Baſqui</hi> with the condition of all affairs ſince my arrival, and given him account of my Negotiations with the Nobility, whoſe re-union with us was ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and which I held infallible, as ſoon as they ſhould hear I had received ſo powerful ſuccors, and that the Fleet was at my diſpoſal; He told me the Fleet and all the ſuccours were ſent to the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> and were to obey him that commanded them, and that had the principal authority in the City. I replyed that was I, ſince the ſupplies and command of the Fleet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to War, and the people had given me the ſame command over their Armies, as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had over thoſe of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi>; and more the title of Protector of their Liberty, with the diſpoſal of all Military affairs which depended on me alone. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that <hi>Gennaro</hi> was chief and <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> and that <hi>France</hi> taking him to have the abſolute power in the City, he could addreſs himſelf to no other. I alledged his incapacity, want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and ſmall credit. That he medled with little or nothing, beſides that it was unſafe to truſt him, he having evermore ſome ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the enemie, and ſuffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be guided by unconfiding perſons; in a word, that I had acquired the truſt and eſteem
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57207:132"/>
of all the people, of whom I diſpoſed according to my pleaſure.</p>
            <p>When (ſaid he) you ſhall have made appear your abſolute authority in the City, that you are Maſter, and your Orders onely obeyed, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes ſhall be made onely to you; but till then I muſt of neceſſity negotiate in the name of the King with him that hath hitherto ſeemed to have the greateſt command. I aſſured him he ſhould be ſatisfied the next Morning, and that returning to lie aboard, I would give him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it by a Gentleman I would ſend to thoſe that commanded, to complement their arrival<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inform them of the condition of affairs, demand the ſuccours of which we were agreed, and I wanted; deferring it till I could do it in my own name and the peoples, as the head of them, having deprived <hi>Gennaro</hi> of his authority, that to this purpoſe I would return to <hi>Naples</hi> as ſoon as I had dined.</p>
            <p>I then commanded <hi>Pepe Palombe, Onoffrio Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacani, Carlo Longobardo,</hi> and <hi>Cicio Battimiello,</hi> as perſons in whom I confided, and that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the execution of the deſign I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, to march thither with their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and leaving the reſt of the troops under the command of the Baron of <hi>Modene,</hi> I orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to continue the blocking up of <hi>Averſa,</hi> by keeping poſſeſſion of the Quarters I had taken of <hi>Juliana</hi> and Saint <hi>Antimo,</hi> with charge to give me notice of all alterations that ſhould happen, and to attempt nothing without my Orders, which I would punctually ſend him every day:
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57207:133"/>
after Dinner I went to <hi>Naples,</hi> where I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with extraordinary applauſes, my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and credit having been augmented by the fame of the paſſages of the skirmiſh of <hi>Averſa,</hi> and by the exceſs of joy in which I found the whole Town, for the arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and performance of the Promiſes I had made in the Kings name of a powerful and ſpeedie ſuccour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gennaro</hi> was overjoyed, not ſo much with the ſhare he took of that of the Publick, but out of hopes of re-eſtabliſhing his authority, by the aſſiſtance and ſupport the Abbot <hi>Baſqui</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him, who made it his great buſineſs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite us, and diſorder the Town, in ſuch manner as became a Spie and Penſioner of <hi>Spain,</hi> which he was, though entruſted, in quality of Agent, with all the affairs of <hi>France.</hi> I called for a freſh horſe and immediately viſited all the Poſts, to ſee their condition, and take account of all that had paſſed in my abſence.</p>
            <p>Afterwards I commanded <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> and <hi>Mathaeo d' Amore</hi> to be in arms next Morning in their quarter by nine a clock, and <hi>Onoffrio Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacani, Carlo Longobardo, Cicio Battimiello, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitain Cimino, Ignatio Spagnuolo</hi> and <hi>Graſſullo de Roſa,</hi> to be at the ſame hour in <hi>Battalia,</hi> at the heads of their Companies in the Market-place. The Council having acquainted me with all that happened whileſt I was out of Town, I prayed them to come to me in the Morning between eight and nine, that I might communicate to them an affair of extraordinarie Concernment,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57207:133"/>
and <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> having, as he uſed to do, entertained me with diſcourſe of the ignorance and brutality of <hi>Gennaro,</hi> which diſordered all, and would cauſe the final ruine of the people, if (out of Charity) I took not the entire autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into my hands, with the conduct of all affairs; ſuffering my ſelf to be a good while preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſeemed at laſt to be perſwaded, and to take my Reſolution out of Compliance with his thoughts, ſo to engage him the more firmly to ſupport a deſign of which he believed himſelf the Author, and to which he ſuppoſed he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me the firſt incouragement. I bid him good night, and that he ſhould not fail to be with me betimes in the Morning, that I ſtood in very great need as well of his Council as Credit for putting in execution what I had undertaken, and of which he had cauſed me to reſolve. After Supper I went to Bed to repoſe in expectation of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which was to open the moſt happy and glorious day of my life, as I ſhall ſhew by what I attempted with ſucceſs, and by the ſolid eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Sovereign Authority, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the day of my Impriſonment, with greater reſpect and ſubmiſſion of the people of <hi>Naples</hi> than they ever ſhewed to the perſon of any of their Kings.</p>

            <p>THe Twentieth of <hi>December</hi> I roſe at day-break, and having heard Maſs, ſhut my ſelf up with <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi>; we conferred of the meanes I was to uſe for compleating ſo great and important an enterprize as that I had reſolved to execute. The Council waited on me, whom I let under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That the incapacity, ignorance and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of <hi>Gennaro</hi> ruin'd all; that he minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Plundering and Robbing the whole City; that it was high time to put an end to thoſe Diſorders: and, that now our Succors were arrived, and we had power in our hands to go ſeriouſly to worke for eſtabliſhing repoſe and liberty, we were to apply our ſelves to it with all our might, and regulate all things in ſuch a manner, that the order and good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which we ſhould cauſe to be obſerved in the Town, might begin to gain us credit, and acquire us ſome reputation throughout <hi>Italy,</hi> which was very neceſſary for us, to the end, that making appear we acted no more tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, we might be conſidered as perſons ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bringing to perfection ſo great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a deſign, as that of freeing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples</hi> from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tyranny;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57207:135"/>
That we could not drive them out, without gaining to us the Nobility, who alone were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of maintaining them, and of oppoſing with their credit and power whatſoever we could undertake againſt them. That I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that all Gentlemen were very well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards me, and confided in me; the main reaſon that prevented them from decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for us, being their averſion for ſubmitting to <hi>Gennaro</hi> and others of the People, for whom their contempt and hatred were ſo violent, there was no way of overcoming it; That this obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was to be removed, after which we ſhould find all eaſie, by placing the Authority in the hands of a perſon for whom they had eſteem, reſpect and affection, and that could ſecure them againſt the apprehenſion of being any more liable to the affronts and violences of the Vulgar: That theſe weighty reaſons made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to undertake the conduct of all Affaires, and to lay on my own ſhoulders the whole burthen of the Government, though I very well underſtood the toils and perils to which I expoſed my ſelf: but, ſeeing no other means of delivering the Kingdom from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and that my endeavours would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe without ſucceſs, my affection to the People of <hi>Naples</hi> made me reſolve to ſacrifice my life to the dangers of War, Poyſon, Aſſaſſination, Tumults and Seditions, to the envy of many perſons, and the rage of ſuch others as <hi>I</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to contain within the limits of reſpect and fear, not ſuffering any more the inſolencies
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57207:135"/>
and violences they had been wont to practice, that all might enjoy repoſe and liberty.</p>
            <p>Upon all which I deſired them freely, and without any by-reſpects to give me their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, being reſolved to acquieſce in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions whatſoever they might be. They were all unanimous, and did not only approve my reſolution, but with one voice beſought me no longer to delay the putting it in execution; that being at the brink of ruine, and no ſafety viſible without this expedient, they and the People, for whoſe good intentions they would be reſponſible, were reſolved to ſpend their lives and fortunes for the eſtabliſhment and preſervation of my Authority.</p>
            <p>Seeing things in ſo fair a way, I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Officers to be at the head of their Men in the Market-place; and all Captains of the ſeveral quarters of the City to aſſemble the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to attend my Orders: I ſent the Sieurs <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio Scaccia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ento,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtino Mollo,</hi> to go in the Peoples name and mine to <hi>Gennaro,</hi> to give him thanks for the pains he had till then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in maintaining the Town, and preſerving it in ſo good a condition, free from the cruel and violent Dominion of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; but, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now time to eſtabliſh Order in <hi>Naples,</hi> and finiſh what had been begun ſo happily, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture having not given him an intellect and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity ſufficient for the ſupport of ſo weighty Affaires, General Applications had been made to me to undertake them; That it was time for him to think of repoſe, after having laboured
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57207:136"/>
ſo long and uſefully, in recompence whereof we offered him the Government of the New Caſtle as ſoon as we ſhould be Maſters of it, the Title of Duke or Prince of one of the beſt Towns that ſhould be confiſcated, and Fifty thouſand Crownes Revenue to him and his Succeſſors: That nothing ſhould be done without his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; That he ſhould have the ſecond place in the Government and Councils, where, in my abſence, he ſhould be Preſident; That, in conſideration of the great number of enemies he had made in the time of his Adminiſtration, he ſhould be allowed Guards, and permitted to carry them about with him for his ſafety. That if he ſeriouſly conſidered theſe offers, he ought to be well ſatisfied in the acknowledgments of his Services, think it a happineſs to ſee his fortune ſo well eſtabliſhed and himſelf diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the burthen of Affairs, of which he was not capable, and rejoyce to be ſecured from ſo many perils and accidents which had hitherto threatned him, by an honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of that Authority which the People for very important reaſons, could not, nor ought not any longer to ſuffer in his hands; that, if he did not this voluntarily, all meanes would be uſed for compelling him to it; that we ſhould be ſorry to have recourſe to violence, and to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to endeavour his ruin as an enemy, and diſturber of the Publick quiet.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen repreſented all this to him, with a great deal of eloquence and efficacy; but he, whoſe timerous nature would on his
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57207:136"/>
knees have accepted ſo advantageous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he had alſo oftentimes ſought, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſupported by the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and animated by the conference he had held with the Abbot <hi>Baſqui,</hi> inſolently reply'd, That he would continue Maſter, and knew very well how to maintain his Authority and Power. This Anſwer being brought me, I preſently got on Horſeback, followed by my Servants and ſuch <hi>Frenchmen</hi> as I had about me, the number of whom was increaſed by the Sieurs <hi>de Mallet</hi> and <hi>Villepreux,</hi> Captains in the Regiment of <hi>la Motte,</hi> Perſons of Merit and Valor, who were come from the Gariſon of <hi>Portolongone</hi> with Letters of Recommendation from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Fontenai</hi> for employment; by the Sieurs <hi>de Beauvais, de Apremont, de La Serre,</hi> and the Knight <hi>de La Viſelette,</hi> (ſome of which came from <hi>Rome,</hi> and others from <hi>Venice,</hi> whom the deſire of ſerving in our War, and following my Fortune, had invited) and accompanied by <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> and the chief of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, came into the Market-place; where, having Commanded ſilence, I propounded all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before alledged, and demanded, Whom they would have Command in <hi>Naples, Gennaro</hi> or my ſelf; they anſwered with great Cries, That they would no more hear of <hi>Gennaro,</hi> a man brutal and incapable; that they would live and die under me, to whom they had ſo eſſential Obligations, and by whoſe means alone they expected to obtain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and Liberty: This was followed by a
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57207:137"/>
General ſhout in my favour, and with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Exclamation of, Long live the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> our King; we will have none but him, nor ever own any other.</p>
            <p>I cauſed the noiſe to ceaſe, telling them, My Ambition was more moderate, that the time of making themſelves a Maſter was not yet come, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> muſt firſt be driven away; that ſo precipitated a reſolution would infallibly cauſe their Ruine and mine, by drawing on me the envy of all Europe, and depriving us of all the Supplies we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which were ſo neceſſary for us; rhat rather then conſent, I would Ship my ſelf on the Fleet and be gone; that I aimed at nothing but doing them ſervice, and Sacrificing my ſelf to free them from ſlavery, without pretending any other recompence, then what I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from ſo great and worthy an action: From thence (very much ſatisfied in their affection) I went into the <hi>Concheria, Lavinare,</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all the Quarters of the Town, where all paſſed after the ſame manner, and in a faſhion yet more obliging.</p>
            <p>The great round I was fain to make cauſed me to come very late to the Convent of Saint <hi>Lawrence,</hi> where all deliberations are made that concern the Affaires of the Kingdome; I cauſed the Bell to be immediately Rung, to Aſſemble the Magiſtrates, the Military and City Captains, and the Council: When they were come together, I told them I had ſent for them, not to ſeek of them the Authority, and abſolute
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57207:137"/>
Command the People with one Voice had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conferred upon me; but, to advertiſe them, that, having accepted it, they ſhould publiſh it to all men, forbidding them, on pain of their lives, to receive or acknowledge any other Orders then mine: That I would like a good Father Protect all ſuch as ſhould comply with their duty, and faithfully obey me: As, on the other ſide, I ſhould not fail to puniſh all thoſe that for the future failed of the reſpect they owed me.</p>
            <p>After this I diſmiſſed them; and was told that <hi>Gennaro</hi> made a great Commotion amongſt the inferior ſort of People, perſwading them, that I took upon me the Command at the arrival of the Fleet, on purpoſe to put the Town into the hands of <hi>France</hi>; and that under pretence of gaining them Liberty, I only went about to change their Fetters, and impoſe heavier then the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had hitherto detained them in. Night being too farr advanced to go to appeaſe this Tumult, accompanied as uſually with inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and diſorder, I deferred it till the morning, and in the mean time ſent to <hi>Gennaro,</hi> to conſider well what he did; that at Ten a Clock I would go to Maſs at the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> and if by that time he reſigned not his Authority into my hands, I would have his head cut off, and ſet on a Poſte in the Market-place, and would hang his Body by one foot on the Gallows that is in the middle of it: then going to bed, I with extraordinary impatience expected day, to finiſh what I had ſo happily begun.</p>
            <p>In the mean while there was great running to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57207:138"/>
and fro, and many Cabals were made, which I nevertheleſs diſſipated with much facility. I aroſe very early, and many Gentlemen of the moſt conſiderable of <hi>Naples</hi> came to wait on me, amongſt others, <hi>Mazillo Caracciolo, Marco Antonio Brancaccio,</hi> and <hi>Bartholomeo Griffo,</hi> whom I intended to make Colonel of my Guards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a perſon of Quality, and an old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, of great merit and experience, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zillo Cracciolo</hi> Camp-maſter-General, who was very well born, and of great ability, that had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Armes all his life with much honor, and an irreconcileable enemy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by whom he had been very ill uſed: but, the People ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a diſlike of them, this intention had no effect, I thinking fit to have ſome reſpect for their averſion; But, I kept ſtill near me old <hi>Marco Antonio Brancaccio,</hi> whoſe Counſels I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on all important occaſions, which ever ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded well, deriving many advantages from my confidence in him.</p>
            <p>About eight a Clock I went to Maſs, after which I ſpoke to the People, who heard me fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably, and by their Anſwers, Cries and Acclamations appeared yet more affected to and more reſolved to make me their King, then over-night; I with the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſſwaded them, tel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing them, I was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to retire, and abandon them, if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in that thought. I got on horſeback to go to St. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> followed by above twenty thouſand People, where I heard the Magiſtrates of the City, and the Council were aſſembled, that
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57207:138"/>
being the uſual place where they are wont to deliberate, and making a ſtand under the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the room where they were at Council, I ſent the Captain of my Guards to enquire what they were doing, and let them know that having acquainted them with my intentions, it was to very little purpoſe for them to imagine they had any thing to determine on; That all the people had owned me, by whoſe general acclamations they might eaſily underſtand their pleaſure; That if they went about to caſt in any difficulty or qualification, I had no more to do but looſen the reigns to the people, whom I had much ado to reſtrain from throwing them all out at the Windows. They demanded a little patience, by which I ſhould be ſatisfied of their obedience and zeal, and immediately after they brought me the reſult of their Conſultations, ſigned by all that were preſent, by which they declared me Duke of their Republick for five years, with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and ſovereign power, which was approved by the conſent and applauſe of all the people.</p>
            <p>After this I went into the Market-place, where I found five or ſix thouſand Mutineers in Arms with a ſtrange tumult, I rid up to them and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what obliged them to ſuch a diſorder: they anſwered that <hi>Gennaro</hi> had told them, I undertook the authority to no other end but to reſign it to <hi>France,</hi> and that I took poſſeſſion of the Kingdom in the name of the King, intending to land all the troops that were aboard the Fleet, to deliver the Town to them, to which they would never give their conſent, being deſirous of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57207:139"/>
an entire Liberty, and to ſee their Country without dependance on any other: that they would not ſuffer themſelves to become ſubject to another Nation, the chief occaſion of their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Arms, having been to drive away the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> that they might be free, which could not be by their ſubjection to the <hi>French,</hi> whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion would be equally rough and inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; that they ſought protection and ſuccours, but not ſubjection; and when they deſired aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, they thought it ſhould have been given them without any other intereſt then the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebliſhment and ruine of their enemies. I endeavoured to diſabuſe them, and rectifie this miſtake which had no foundation, telling them that <hi>France</hi> had no ſuch intention, that of this I was ſufficiently aſſured, having received Orders to engage the contrary (as I had already done) and that Commiſſions were not given to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of my Quality to be afterwards diſavowed, by giving the lie to ſuch things as they had been commanded to declare in behalf of a Crown, ſo exact in executing whatſoever it poſitively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſo religious in obſerving its faith. That I was a pledge they ought entirely to truſt to, and that I would never have accepted the title of Protectour of their Liberty to become inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the loſs of it.</p>
            <p>Anſwer was made that they ſhould have no ſuſpition nor diſtruſt of me, were I not born a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> but that they had reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om a perſon that muſt preferre the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of his Country above all other concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57207:139"/>
I anſwered them, that what they doubted was not the intereſt of my Country, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that I embraced none but theirs: the Oath I ſo ſolemnly made at my acceptance of the command of their Armies having diſcharged me from all others, making me ceaſe to be any longer a <hi>Frenchman</hi> and become a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> of which they needed not doubt, ſince I did it not without the permiſſion and order of my King, who then diſcharged me of what I owed to him by his approbation of my engaging my ſelf in their ſervice. One of the moſt mutinous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting to tell me, that I could not ſeparate my ſelf from my affection to my Country, where I had my Birth, I replyed I was born in the <hi>Felucca</hi> that brought me to <hi>Naples,</hi> beyond which I took cogniſance of nothing. This anſwer being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſo agreeably ſurpriſed them, and was ſo welcomely received, that they made a great ſhout, and cried out altogether that they would live and die with me, and reſolved never to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any other Maſter.</p>
            <p>From thence I went to the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> where I found <hi>Gennaro,</hi> who aſtoniſhed at my good fortune, and looking on himſelf as without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or partie, waited for me at the Church-gate; well informed of all that had paſſed at Saint <hi>Lawrence,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtins,</hi> and the Market-place: He fell on his Knees before me to begg pardon, beſeeching me to grant him the advantages I had offered him over-night, and caſting his ſtaff at my feet, which I ordered him to re-aſſume in quality of my Lieutenant, made a renunciation of his
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57207:140"/>
power before publick Notaries, which we both of us ſigned on the rail of the high Altar, cauſing the chief of thoſe that were preſent to ſign alſo as witneſſes, after which <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung, and we heard Maſs together; at his deſire I cauſed an inſtrument to be drawn up of all the Priviledges and Advantages I had granted him, and with a thouſand acclamations and ſhouts of joy, returned into the Convent, and carried him to Dine with me in my apartment. At the end of which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zillo Caracciolo,</hi> repreſenting that the Kings breed of Horſes was entirely ruined, I gave him order to return all Mares that had been taken away, in which I was ſo punctually obeyed that very few were loſt, and that they might be afterwards preſerved with greater authority, I made him Maſter of the Horſe, a charge time out of mind poſſeſſed by thoſe of his family, and particularly by the Marquis of Saint <hi>Eraſmo</hi> his Uncle, which afterwards obliged him to be more aſſiduous about my perſon. I then ſent for <hi>Angustino Mollo</hi> a famous advocate, and great friend of the Nobility, having managed the affairs of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of them, and ordered him to give them notice of all theſe good ſucceſſes, of the arrival of the Fleet, and that they ſhould now have the ſatisfaction of making no addreſſes but to me alone, who had the abſolute authority and might call my ſelf Maſter, that therefore they needed no longer apprehend the inſolencies of the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, having in me a Protectour not only powerful but ſo great a friend to their Intereſts. After this I cauſed Letters to be written to all parts of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57207:140"/>
Kingdom, and Manifeſts to be ſent to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, with ſuch ſucceſs, that very ſhortly after, in a manner all the Towns, except ſuch as had Gariſons, ſent to aſſure me of their obedience, and expreſſed extraordinarie Joy, that they were to own no other authority but mine, which I took all the care imaginable to render juſt and acceptable, ſtudying to oblige every body, and acquire a general eſteem and affection, in which I had very happy ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>I cauſed to be prepared a great preſent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of all manner of refreſhments, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever could be found in a great, rich and proud City, that had yet for ſome Moneths ſuffered by Revolutions and War, with which twelve <hi>Feluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>'s were laden, to ſend to thoſe that commanded the Kings Fleet, with account of the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Naples,</hi> the renunciation made to me by <hi>Gennaro</hi> of his authority, my eſtabliſhment in it by the general conſent of the people, and the title that had been given me of the Duke of the Republick, with that of Protectour of its Liberty, and <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of its Armies; on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I could no longer doubt but the Fleet was to receive my Orders, ſince the Abbot <hi>Baſqui</hi> had aſſured me, they were to be received from no other but ſuch a perſon as ſhould be head of the people, and abſolute maſter of the Town; that this diſcourſe obliged me to attempt what I had ſo happily effected, and to eſtabliſh my authority on the ruines of that of <hi>Gennaro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sieur de Taillade,</hi> to whom I had given his Commiſſion, was alſo to make my Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57207:141"/>
to the Generals and all particular Officers, and to preſs in my name the landing all ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours as two or three days before I had agreed on with the ſaid Abbot <hi>Baſchi</hi>; but I was forced to deferre his departure by the Fleets removal out of ſight of the Town to burn, as it did, five ſhips of the enemy that rid at anchor under <hi>Castelamare,</hi> the Commanders ſeeking by this little action, to efface the ſhame of not having at their firſt arrival taken or deſtroyed the whole Fleet of <hi>Spain,</hi> as they might eaſily and without hazard have done, if they had pleaſed: which would have put an end to all, and compelled the Viceroy and all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to yield to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being generally unprovided of all things, and after ſo conſiderable a loſs out of poſſibility of receiving any ſuccours from abroad. They now ſhipped what men they could, and weighing anchor went to fight the <hi>French,</hi> who had wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglected to conquer them when they were in no condition to defend themſelves: in fine the fight began which laſted five or ſix hours, but without any conſiderable advantage on either ſide, nothing being done but firing their Canon without boarding, of which I will not trouble my ſelf to make the recital, its particulars being known, and I reſolved to relate nothing but what I am my ſelf concerned in. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> retreated, one part of them to ſhelter themſelves under <hi>Caſtello de l' Ovo,</hi> and the other to anchor in the Haven of <hi>Baia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Kings Fleet returned within ſight, I ſent the <hi>Sieur de Taillade</hi> to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57207:141"/>
of the Commiſſion I had given him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in my name the fourty thouſand weight of Powder had been promiſed me, with the reſt of the Ammunition, the landing eighteen hundred foot, ſuch of the Queens Guards and Regiment of <hi>Monſieur de Manicamp,</hi> as they had given me hope of, to mount on horſeback, and for recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ten pieces of Canon, for which I had cauſed Ponts to be made at the point of <hi>Poſilippe.</hi> All theſe things they conſented to, but performed not. I alſo encharged him to deſire the Generals and chief Officers of the Fleet to come aſhore where I would entertain them at Dinner, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with them of all ſuch things as we were to do by conſent, eſpecially of an attacque upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who had not forces ſufficient to man all their forts; ſo that either they muſt abandon their ſhips, or elſe would become ſo weak in both places by dividing their power, that they muſt neceſſarily looſe the day, with their Fleet and all they were poſſeſſed of in the Town, if by Sea and Land we fell upon them at one and the ſame time. But as Land conduct muſt be regulated with reſpect to Sea affairs, which depend on the wind, I would expect a ſignal from the Fleet, and be in a readineſs to fall on as ſoon as I ſaw it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for fight.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sieur de Taillade</hi> returned with many fair words and promiſes, of all I had ordered him to demand in my name, and the Abbot <hi>Baſqui</hi> came to me accompanied by Father <hi>de Juliis,</hi> for a more particular regulation of all affairs with me; I received them joyfully, expecting to find
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57207:142"/>
an entire ſatisfaction in this Conference, but I diſcovered that he ſought nothing elſe but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of complaint againſt me, and that there was no intention of giving me ſuccours. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to land the troops which I moſt earneſtly deſired, but demanding Money without which they would not onely be uſeleſs, but altogether prejudicial and deſtructive, he anſwered he had none to give me, becauſe the Bills of Exchange upon <hi>Genoua</hi> could not as yet be complied with. I told him if the troops were landed without Money to pay them, it would be impoſſible for me to contain them within the Bounds of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and that imagining themſelves to be in a conquered Countrey, and a new War, I ſhould not be able to prevent their plundering and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious living, Souldiers being kept in order by puniſhment onely, which cannot be inflicted when they are unpaied; and that ſo their inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and exceſſes would not onely incite the hatred of the Countrey againſt the <hi>French</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but having to do with a cruel and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous people, finding themſelves ill uſed by thoſe from whom they expected aſſiſtance, they would cut all their throats and mine amongſt the reſt, and ſo we ſhould become an infallible means of re-eſtabliſhing the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> authority.</p>
            <p>To prevent ſuch an inconvenience, I told him I knew very well there was great gaming, and a great deal of Money in the Fleet, and that it would be eaſie to make a purſe of two thouſand Piſtols, with which I would be ſatisfied in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of greater ſummes, and that being able
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57207:142"/>
to pay the men I demanded eight or ten days, I would endeavour in that time to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the Town, and poſſibly might take one of the three Caſtles, and by buſying all their forces on Land make them leave their Fleet ſo diſarmed that it might be all burnt or taken. He anſwered me, that the Fleet came away in ſuch haſte, that all were in ſuch a manner unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that he could not ſupply me with ſo much as a hundred Piſtols, to which I replyed, it being ſo, he needed not think of landing any troops, ſince I could well enough ſubſiſt without them, and would have patience till he cauſed Money to come, without which, in ſtead of getting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by their landing, I ſhould looſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>France,</hi> beſides that it would infallibly coſt me my life, and procure the enemies ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages as they were not in a condition to hope for.</p>
            <p>From this anſwer occaſion hath been taken to complain of me, and to ſay, that I refuſed the ſuccors were offered me, that I might have no dependance on <hi>France,</hi> ſuppoſing I could ſubſiſt without her. But let ſuch as will take pains to conſider theſe things without paſſion judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my comportment, or the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they dealt with me were more blameable.</p>
            <p>After this I demanded Powder, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it, and ſending <hi>Felucca</hi>'s to fetch it, they returned them with ſix and thirty Barrels, thirty of which were for <hi>Gennaro</hi> to ſupply the <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> Tower, and onely ſix for me, giving me hope of the remainder of the fourty thouſand weight,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57207:143"/>
which I never could obtain. For Artillery my Ponts were not well enough made to ſatisfie the Officers of the Fleet, who ſaid, they could not hazard the Canon in them till they were mended, which I cauſed to be done but to no purpoſe. For Bullets and Match there was not any more mention made of them.</p>
            <p>The Abbot <hi>Baſqui</hi> propoſed to me to go aboard the Fleet to ſpeak with the Generals, which, beſides that I could not do it with honour, a Governour never going out of a place that is beſieged, being entruſted with the ſafety of the Town, the command of the Gariſon, and an authority over the whole Countrey, it had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been handſom nor reaſonable, that I ſhould have hazarded the loſs of <hi>Naples,</hi> whileſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wind might have hindered my return to remedy the diſorders my abſence ſhould have cauſed; the reſpect of my perſon and preſence alone maintaining a turbulent and ſeditious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in duty and obedience. But had I wanted all theſe reaſons, he made his propoſal to me in a faſhion ſo farre from being perſwaſive, that it tended rather to give me diſtruſt and jealouſie: ſo that I perceived he had no other end than to do me ill Offices, by giving out (as he did at his return) that I had not onely refuſed all the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances propoſed, but that I declined all corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence and commerce with the Officers of the Fleet, and he was beſides ſo malicious that he cauſed me to be told by Father <hi>de Juliis,</hi> as a friendly advice, that I ſhould have a care how I went aboard the Fleet, ſince there was an
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57207:143"/>
order and deſign to arreſt me. The ſame father, by the ſame inſtigation, gave out, that he had diſcovered that I had an intention at the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment I would have made at <hi>Poſilippe,</hi> to have detained the Officers that ſhould have come aſhore as hoſtages, till ſuch time as they ſhould have given me the aſſiſtance I had demanded, and they promiſed me; This artifice was made uſe of to break all Communication between us, by which we might have diſcovered all the deceits of this Gallant; and by it I was ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in what I well enough underſtood before, that he was a Spie and Penſioner of <hi>Spain:</hi> of which I believe, every man that attentively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders his comportment is perſwaded as well as my ſelf, and judges him rather to have been a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> than <hi>French</hi> agent, but I have more ſolid proofs. For the Nobility ſending to know whether the Fleet had order to depend on me, and that if ſo, they would declare for us, and I returning anſwer it had, he went the ſame night to <hi>Gennaro,</hi> to give him aſſurance they were to obey none but him, which the next day he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, to ruine my deſigns, and cauſe all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to re-engage in the ſervice of <hi>Spain,</hi> rather than become ſubject to the inſolence and bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Gennaro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing happened which had like to have made me looſe all patience; two ſhips laden with Corn coming to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were taken by our Fleet within our ſight, at which I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely glad, believing Heaven had miraculouſly ſent them to relieve our neceſſities, but they
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57207:144"/>
were carried to <hi>Portolongone,</hi> and we put off with ſlight excuſes, and hopes of their return from day to day. Their malice went yet farther, for the Abbot <hi>Baſchi</hi> telling me the Fleet wanted Biſcuit, and deſiring me to furniſh them till the arrival of that they expected from <hi>Provence,</hi> and with it plenty of Corn for us: though I had but three weeks Proviſion, I cauſed half of it to be baked, which being done and it become in a manner uſeleſs, he left it on my hands, telling me a ſhip had lately brought ſome to the Fleet, ſo that now they had no occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>After this he made me a very ridiculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to give the Protection of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> to the Cardinal of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Cecilia,</hi> to which I anſwered that I was too great a ſervant of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> his brother, to conſent to a thing ſo contrary to his honour, which would make him the ſcorn and table-talk of <hi>Rome,</hi> by becoming Protectour of a Republick could paſs for no other than chimerical, becauſe as yet but onely in Idea. He perverted alſo this judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwer, and made uſe of it to ſpread abroad that I was not onely the enemy of <hi>France,</hi> but of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> and his Family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> a cloſe adherent to <hi>Spain,</hi> conſpired with him to lay a ſnare for me, which I preſently diſcovered and avoided; it was that to ſhew the abſolute eſtabliſhment of my autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I ought to coin Money, and not ſuffer that of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to be any longer current, that ſo they might render uſeleſs the little Money I could make my ſelf maſter of. I ſeemed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57207:144"/>
this advice, and cauſed ſome Silver and Copper to be coined, but with this precaution, that in a thouſand Crowns not above fifty bore the ſtamp of the Republick, the reſt that of <hi>Spain,</hi> but with a date of the former year: On which account they ſought to prejudice me, but my reaſons appeaſed a little tumult that was raiſed on this occaſion, and thought it beſt to forbear a vanity that might put us in a condition of ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>They ſought to bring another inconvenience upon me, from which I freed my ſelf with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and vigour. <hi>Gennaro</hi> followed by a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous rabble came tumultuouſly to demand of me the pardon of <hi>Michael de Santis,</hi> who was very much beloved in the town, for the agreeable ſervice he had done the multitude, during the firſt tumults, in cutting off the head of <hi>Dom Pepe Caraffa,</hi> and cauſing his body to be dragged about the Streets, repreſenting to me, that if I put him to death, it would be thought that I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed him to the reſentments of the Nobility, for whom I ſhould expreſs ſo great an affection that it would make the people deſpair. I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that his puniſhment was important towards the ſupporting my authority, his temerity and inſolence having been too exceſſive and publick to be paſſed by. He told me his pardon was ſought by them all, and that the refuſal of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt they were ſo zealous in would cauſe a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſurrection. I replied, that I was not of an humour to be compelled to any thing, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof would be dangerous, that I
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57207:145"/>
would accuſtom the people to bear me more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and come on their knees to begge ſuch Graces as they ſought of me, and not fancy they ſhould oblige me to a condeſcention by fear; that this too bold proceeding ſhould haſten his death, contrary to my intention, for if they had gone to work more moderately, and with greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, I would have given them his life. That I valued not tumults, having credit and reſolution enough to appeaſe them, continue the Town in its duty, and cauſe ſuch to be puniſhed as went about to make any commotion, and that if I heard but the leaſt murmuring, I would cauſe the Gallowſes of the Market-place to be furniſhed with the moſt violent and mutinous. That they ſhould learn to know me better, and the manner of applying themſelves to me, and calling one of my Guards, I, in their hearing, commanded him to carry order to <hi>Bernardo Spirito,</hi> the Auditor general, to cauſe <hi>Michael de Santis</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and immediately after executed on the High-way that goes to <hi>Averſa,</hi> and to ſet up a Poſt there, and place his head upon it, and hang his body by one foot on a tree, with an inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I had cauſed him to die as a perſon ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and bloudie, a diſobeyer of my orders and contemner of my authority. This was punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally executed to the great ſatisfaction of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, whoſe affection for me was much increaſed by the exact performance of my promiſe, and my care to revenge and content them, after which diſmiſſing thoſe that came to plead for him with ſo much inſolence and imprudence, I rid up and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57207:145"/>
down the Town to ſee what effect the menaces had been made me might produce; but I found the ſame teſtimonies of affection and reſpect that were uſual, without any mans daring to complain or open his mouth on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>A while after the Abbot <hi>Baſchi</hi> viſited <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro,</hi> whom he thought incenſed by the little value I had for him and his interceſſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with him the means of ruining me, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him in order to it the aſſiſtance of <hi>France,</hi> and the re-eſtabliſhment of his Authority. They admitted none to this ſecret Conference but <hi>Tonno Baſſo,</hi> and ſome others of their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, with Doctor <hi>Franciſco Pati,</hi> a man of whom they had no jealouſie, who at <hi>Rome</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my privity, two days before my departure, agreed with <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay</hi> to have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> tributary to <hi>France,</hi> and had ever after held a ſecret correſpondence with him.</p>
            <p>About five next Morning the ſaid <hi>Franciſco de Pati</hi> came to demand audience of me, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting himſelf on his Knees at my bed-ſide, gave me account of all particulars that had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Gennaro</hi> and the Abbot <hi>Baſchi,</hi> what he had negotiated with <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay,</hi> and generally all the ſecrets of their correſpondence, of which he promiſed me punctual advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the future, deſiring, in recompence of this important ſervice, the charge of Preſident in the Chamber of accounts: The Abbot <hi>Baſqui</hi> coming to viſit me at my riſing, I told him I was very much ſurpriſed at the manner of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57207:146"/>
which could be no other if he were paid by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and intended their ſervice. At this he was out of countenance and changed color, and began to enter upon many juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with a thouſand proteſtations of affection and ſervice; to which I replyed, that he ſhould not deceive me by fair words, that though I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him to have great abilities, he came ſhort of that; and was of too heavie a Phiſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie to over-reach me, that though I believed he had ſtudied <hi>Machiavel,</hi> if I entered into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of wit with him, it ſhould be with ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Politicks, that I would in two hours give him ſuch Commentaries, as he ſhould not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret with ten years ſtudy. He told me he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood nothing of all this diſcourſe, which I was willing to explain to him, by declaring that I had notice of his moſt ſecret intrigues, his negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and their deſigns againſt my authority, libertie and life, which he impudently attempted to deny. But he was altogether out of countenance, when I gave him the particulars of all that had paſſed, of the means they intended to uſe for putting their intentions in execution, and nominated to him all perſons that had knowledge of this plot; he ſeemed very much diſturbed, yet fortified himſelf on the negative, but was entirely confounded when I declared to him that I was informed of all theſe things by <hi>Franciſco de Pati,</hi> and told him the recompence I had given him for ſo eminent a ſervice, and that if he deſired it, I would ſend for him to juſtifie all to his face. His ſpeech failed him, and he was
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57207:146"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o poſſeſt by fear, that he thought his life at an end, but I recovered him by aſſurance that I bore ſo great reſpect to his Character of the Kings Agent, that whatſoever he had attempted againſt me, in ſtead of reſentments he ſhould receive from me all manner of Civilities and Services. That I would oblige him to acknowledge that I had greater zeal, paſſion and fidelity for the ſervice of <hi>France</hi> than himſelf, ſince his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours tended all to the re-eſtabliſhing the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ruining an enterpriſe ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the Crown, by contriving the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the moſt zealous, faithful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed ſervant it ever had, and that in deſpite of all his malicious artifices I would continue ſuch, reſolved to ſacrifice my life for its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and glory: that I was aſſured ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous proceedings would be diſavowed, and that it was not by the Courts orders that he acted in ſuch a manner: and that there was no need to have recourſe to ſo extraordinary wayes for overthrowing my fortune, and oppoſing my eſtabliſhment, for if the Court had any diſtruſt of me, or would not have me continue any longer at <hi>Naples,</hi> on the firſt order ſigned by his Majeſty, or the leaſt ticket under the hand of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> I would go away without conteſt, to give account of my actions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the glory of obeying and complying with my duty, to the higheſt and moſt ſolid eſtabliſhment I could expect from Fortune. He was ſorry to find me ſo ſubmiſſive, becauſe he wanted a pretence to prejudice me: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57207:147"/>
dealt ſo ill with me, he was careful not to give a true account of my conduct; but on the contrary did me all the ill offices he poſſibly could, to prevent my being aſſiſted, and cauſing me to be abandoned by all, ſo to haſten the ruine of a perſon he had too highly offended to expect any pardon, and that would ever be an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable witneſs of his infidelity to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He continued two days in <hi>Naples</hi> after this, in which he neglected not the purſuit of his deſigns, as will appear by the remainder of this diſcourſe. He plotted to cauſe me to be killed in a popular commotion, and agreed of all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of doing it, with <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> and others of that Cabal; would have me looked on as the tyrant of <hi>Naples,</hi> rather than as the reſtorer of her Liberty, and in caſe he failed in this, which he thought the handſomeſt way of doing it, that ſo he might ſeem unconcerned in an accident, which would be attributed onely to the fury of an outrageous and tumultuous multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he reſolved, caſting off his mask, to cauſe me to be poniarded by a conſpiracie of ſeventeen perſons, the heads of whom were <hi>Tonno Baſſo, Salvator de Gennaro,</hi> and <hi>Petro Damico</hi>; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them that as an enemy of <hi>France</hi> I was the cauſe the people received no ſuccours from thence, which would ſupply all their wants abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly as ſoon as it ſhould have knowledge of my death, and that without this the Fleet had order to abandon them. I had ſome jealouſie of this plot, and engaged two perſons, who ſeeming very much diſſatisfied and animated
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57207:147"/>
againſt me, had admittance into all their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and gave me punctual advertiſement of all reſolutions that were taken.</p>
            <p>That very night they drew a great many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into arms in the Market-place, and ſent a like number into the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Cloyſter where I lodged, and I was ſurpriſed to ſee (whileſt I was in conference with the Abbot <hi>Baſchi</hi>) the Magiſtrates of the Town and <hi>Council</hi> come in, who demanded to ſpeak with me of an affair of the higheſt conſequence for the publick good. <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> having met them as if by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>Tonno Baſſo</hi> was their ſpokesman, a man eloquent, hot headed, and violent. He told me the people had ſatisfaction in my conduct, with a very great ſenſe of the extraordinary ſervices I had rendered them; but the eſtabliſhment of a Republick being ſo neceſſary, he beſought me to lay the firſt foundations; That I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the qualitie of Duke, and General of their Forces, with the title of Protectour of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which I had ſo well deſerved, but that it was time to form a Senate, without whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and deliberation nothing ſhould be acted or undertaken; for whileſt the whole authority was in my perſon alone, I ſeemed either a King or a tyrant; that the jealouſie of this would draw upon me the hatred of all men, becauſe it would look as if I had rather a deſign to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the City and Kingdom than to deliver them from Captivity.</p>
            <p>This captious diſcourſe ſurprized, but did not aſtoniſh me, and cauſed me in an inſtant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect

all that my intellect could furniſh me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which was augmented by the neceſſity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately freeing my ſelf from ſo dangerous and ſlippery a precipice, there being much to be apprehended on either ſide, ſince if I refuſed what was ſo preſſingly demanded of me, I could not eſcape death by diſcovering an intention to become a tyrant, and if I yielded to what was deſired I ſhould afterwards be but a ſhadow without credit and without power. All had their eyes fixed on me, expecting my reſolution with impatience, not imagining that being ſo unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, I could take any advantageous to me, nor avoid a danger ſo evident, and in a manner one and the ſame to which ſide ſoever I inclined. I anſwered them ſmiling, that I thought my ſelf extremely happy, in that the ſervices I had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto endeavoured to render the people were acceptable, but that my ſatisfaction was redoubled, to ſee the paſſion with which they endeavoured to form themſelves into a Republick; that they might recollect that I was the firſt propoſer of this manner of Government, and which I moſt earneſtly deſired to ſee effected as the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous reſolution we could take. That to this no man alive ſhould be more forward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on its eſtabliſhment depended the repoſe and liberty of the Country. That we were ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſult and act in order towards it, but that all <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> eſpecially, having their eyes upon us, we ought to proceed with ſo much juſtice and reaſon, that at leaſt we might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ridiculous, great affairs depending much
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57207:149"/>
on reputation, which ought in ſuch a manner to be husbanded, that nothing might be done from which the enemy ſhould derive advantage, who would carefully obſerve all our ſteps, to make uſe of all our failings, which could not be ſlight, our ſafety or ruine depending on our good or evil conduct; That there were ſeveral ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks, and that we ought very ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, before we made our choice, which of them would be moſt advantageous to us, and moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the humour and diſpoſition of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. That popular Government had ſomething pleaſing, but was not without defects; That both Town and Country were certainly moſt inclined to it, but yet the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> numerous in Nobility, generous and haughty, and that had hitherto had ſo great a ſhare in the Government, I held it very dangerous to exclude them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe deſpair reconciling them to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, we ſhould not without a great deal of difficulty reſiſt their united powers; That their number being ſo great we could neither drive them all out, nor deſtroy them; That none of them were without many friends and dependants, by whoſe means they would cauſe dangerous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions amongſt us, and give birth to ſo many diſturbances as entire ages would not be able to overcome; That deſpairing people are to be feared above all other, who would leave nothing unattempted for preſervation of their honors, lives and eſtates, that we were to fight againſt a renewing <hi>Hydra,</hi> That I could not diſcern what ſhould oblige us to precipitate our ſelves into ſo
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:57207:150"/>
many perils, not onely difficult but impoſſible to be maſtered, which would draw on the enmity of <hi>Rome,</hi> which we ought ſeriouſly to conſider, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in a Government where the <hi>Pope</hi> was the ſupreme Lord, a general ſubverſion could not be made without his participation and conſent, which we ſhould never obtain, by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition would be made by the Intereſt of ſome of the Nobility, nearly allied to ſeveral of the moſt powerful Cardinals, and principal Lords of that Court; That this manner of Republick would never ſuit with us, it being more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to weaken the <hi>Spaniards</hi> than fortifie them with thoſe whoſe valour and conſideration made up all their power, and who no leſs weary than our ſelves of their cruel dominion, would have no other thoughts (when ſafely they might) then to act conjoyntly with us towards repoſe and liberty, and employ againſt thoſe that equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppreſſed us, their lives and fortunes to free themſelves from the tyranny they had ſo many years languiſhed under. That therefore I thought we ought to endeavour to regain the Nobility, by letting them underſtand they may find advantage and ſecurity with us.</p>
            <p>My reaſons were applauded by all, and all granted they were not to be excluded from the Government, and that a popular Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by the difficulty of its eſtabliſhment, would haſten our deſtruction. I told them there appeared to me no leſs inconvenience, ſhould it conſiſt of the Nobility onely, who would tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the people, having too freſh a remembrance
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57207:150"/>
of the outrages received, ſeeing its hands yet ſtained with the bloud of their Relations; That they would never forget the plundering their goods, burning their houſes, and laying waſte their Lands, but would employ the credit and authority ſhould be ſetled on them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar revenges, That in this manner the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might indeed be ruined, but the people would acquire only Chains in ſtead of the Liberty pretended to, and be treated with greater cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than they had ever been by the enemies, for whom they had ſo great horrour and averſion. They all cried out with one voice that this would be ſo farre from giving eaſe, that it would adde to their ſufferings, and was therefore to be no more mentioned; but that they ſhould ſettle in the choice of a mixt Republick, in which the Nobility and People ſhould have equal authority. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that I ſaw yet many difficulties, becauſe we could not of our ſelves take a reſolution of eſtabliſhing it, without firſt conſulting the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, having firſt ſeparated them from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and reunited them with us, it being unjuſt (Heaven having beſtowed upon them ſo many advantages above the people) that the people ſhould give them the Law, and without them form a Government, in which they ought to have the beſt ſhare. That therefore before any thing were concluded on, we ought to give them notice of what we were about to do, that their intereſts might oblige them to come and give their opinions in an affair in which they were principally concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:57207:151"/>They then told me that as Duke of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique I ſhould write to ſummon them to come and deliberate of the Government we were to ſet up, and to conſider together the readieſt and ſecureſt ways for reſtoring Peace and Liberty to the whole Countrey. I am ready, ſaid I, to do all that you ſhall order me on this occaſion, but I fore-ſee ill conſequences upon this reſolution, which may become troubleſome to you, and which I hold my ſelf obliged to repreſent, that you may not hereafter reproach me to have brought upon you ſuch inconveniences as I ſhall have much ado to free you from; We ſhall give the Nobility too great preſumption by addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſelves to them as neceſſary: all of that body will believe we diſtruſt our ſelves, as unable to reſiſt our enemies, unleſs ſupported by their valour and authority, and ſo ſuppoſing we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without them, they will hold the Knife at our throat, and exact ſuch conditions as we cannot with honour, nor ought not to grant them, of which the refuſals exaſperating them againſt us, will more ſtreightly unite them with our enemies, whileſt they imagine us at the point of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>My opinion therefore is that a Manifeſt be publiſhed, by which I will declare, that having been choſen Duke of the Republique, I with open Arms attend all ſuch as will have recourſe to me: that this title as well as that of Protector of their Liberty, as ſtreightly engages me to the intereſts of the Nobility as people, That I have a like conſideration for them, yet with reſpect to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57207:151"/>
the diſtinctions of their Births and Qualities, and like a good Father, though I tenderly love all my Children, put a difference between the reſt and him that hath the Priviledge of Elderſhip; In this manner I invite all to apply themſelves to me, reſolved to treat them according to their different merits, and give to all, in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I intend of a Republick, the Qualities and Advantages that Deſcent and Vertue ought to regulate, ſo impoſing conditions upon ſuch as preſent themſelves, in ſtead of receiving any from them; And as the Nobility are to be looked upon in three ſeveral Conſiderations, we on like manner muſt govern our ſelves in ſeveral manners; There are ſome Gentlemen that have lived well with this City and with their Tenants, and that by their diſcreet Comportment have gained the general eſteem and affection, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do too much towards the advantages and good uſage of ſuch; there are others that have gained the affection of the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> and yet wracked and tyranniſed their tenants, ſuch muſt be obliged to change conduct, and a good underſtanding muſt be made between them and their tenants, leſt by gaining the former we looſe the latter, and interpoſing my authority, muſt engage them to a punctual performance of what ſhall be promiſed on either ſide; The third ſort alike odious as well in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as the City, by reaſon of a continued violent and outrageous Comportment, are not neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to be excluded from all hopes of pardon, for that would of neceſſity compel them to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57207:152"/>
an inſeparable Conjunction with our enemies; it will therefore be better to oblige them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves for a time, leaving to them the injoyment of their eſtates, not recalling them till they have ſuffered a kind of baniſhment, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of their faults, which ſhall be longer or ſhorter according to the probability of their amendment.</p>
            <p>Every part of this diſcourſe had its applauſe, and I was beſought to act conformably to it as ſpeedily as could be poſſible. I undertook it, but repreſented that it would require ſome time, precipitation rather ruining than advancing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this nature. <hi>Tonno Baſſo,</hi> having as the reſt, approved my diſcourſe, told me, there was nothing more juſt nor reaſonable: but as the eſtabliſhment of a Republick muſt neceſſarily be a work of time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he thought it neceſſary to begin immediately to form a Senate; I ſmiled at this and gave him to underſtand, that a Senate being the body of a Republick, the eſtabliſhing the one was no leſs than the eſtabliſhing the other, That we were firſt to conſider in what manner it ought to be regulated, of what number of Senatours it ſhould conſiſt, and how many from every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; whether every Town ſhould have one, and how many the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other things that could not be determined on a ſudden; and beſides that, he knew that to lay the lighteſt tax upon the Country, the Votes of the Peers and Towns were neceſſary, that that of <hi>Naples</hi> alone conſiſted of ſix Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Nobility, and thirty two Ottines of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57207:152"/>
the People, without which it was imperfect; That to deliberate on an affair of the preſent impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſuch a general aſſembly was much more neceſſarily to be called, which for the preſent was abſolutely impoſſible to us.</p>
            <p>He could not deny what I had ſaid, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propounded to make Vice-Senators for the preſent; I told him it had never been heard of to conferre the exerciſe of ſuch charges as were not in nature; but that I perceived (judging me incapable to govern without Council) all his diſcourſe tended to no other end than to form me one, by which he moſt ſenſibly obliged me, ſince I loved not to ſtand ſecurity for ſucceſſes, and was very glad to have others to eaſe me, and capable of giving me good advice. That we ſhould therefore conſider the number firſt of this body, and who ſhould nominate them, and to avoid all diſpute about words, let them if they pleaſed make uſe of that of Vice-Senators; but that it was to be feared leſt the Kingdom would not ſubmit to the authority of ſuch as ſhould be nominated only by the City, and without their participation, and that <hi>Naples</hi> would not looſe the prerogative of being the firſt, every Town pretending particularly to make it ſelf an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Republick, and onely confederate with it. All which I ſpoke not without grounds, having in my Pocket two Letters which I ſhewed them, the one ſubſcribed the Republick of Saint <hi>Severino,</hi> and the other the Republick of <hi>la Cava.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They all began to murmure and cry out, I had
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57207:153"/>
very much reaſon, but <hi>Tonno Baſſo</hi> growing hot and obſtinate in his opinion, I once again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, who were theſe Vice-Senators to be, and who was to nominate them; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me impatiently, that they which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the body of the Council ought to make this nomination; I told him I thought it more reaſonable to be done by the Magiſtrates of the Town, and the Captains of the Quarters. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, not without tranſport, that the Magiſtrates of the Town were not to meddle with affairs of ſuch a nature, their authority extending no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to regulate the price of Proviſions, and maintain Plenty. I admire, ſaid I, that you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the power of thoſe from whom you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive your own; you have been nominated to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and ſerve <hi>Gennaro</hi> as a Council, becauſe of his incapacitie, and his imployment being at an end yours is ſo in like manner; we are now upon a matter of greater importance, and our buſineſs is to enquire whether the Magiſtrates will make new nominations, or by confirming you, deſign you to the employments in queſtion. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute grew hot between the Council and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the Town, to ſuch a height that had it not been for the interpoſal of my authority they had doubtleſsly come from words to blows. They beſought me to put an end to their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and to regulate their pretenſions, I told them I held my ſelf incapable of determining a matter ſo important, and that I might diſoblige none, I would have the Magiſtrates of the Town on one ſide, and ſuch as pretended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

of the Council on the other ſide, give their Reaſons in writing to four of the ableſt Lawyers, who, well verſed in the Cuſtoms of the Country, what was practiſed before it was a Kingdom, or in the inſtant of ſome Revolutions, as that which happened a hundred years before about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, having well ſtudied the caſe, ſhould give me their opinions, which I would afterwards determine, ſince each of them had referred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to me; to this they agreed, and I nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to this effect <hi>John Camillo Caracciolo, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio Scacciavento, Auguſtino Mollo</hi> and <hi>Aniello Porcio:</hi> I then demanded in whoſe hands the authority ſhould reſide in the mean time? They all replied, in yours. Of whom then ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Council, ſaid I, for I will not govern with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, not eſteeming my ſelf ſufficiently capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated for it? you need it not, they replyed, for you underſtand more than all of us. I excuſed my ſelf, telling them, that having to do with a people diffident and hardly to be ſatisfied, I would not expoſe my ſelf to their diſpleaſure, nor give them jealouſie of my authority, beſides that I could not my ſelf alone ſupport the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of ſo many and great affairs, that I came amongſt them to ſerve them without any ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of commanding, longer then I ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to them, or in any other manner than ſhould ſtand with their good liking, and that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſuffer perpetual diſquiet by continual jealouſies that had no foundation, I would retire, and therefore deſired my Paſs while the Fleet was in a condition for my re-imbarking, there

were immediately outcries in the Room where we were, afterwards in the Halls, and then in the Market-place, That the people were loſt if I abandoned them, that they neither had hope nor confidence in any elſe, that they deſired not that I ſhould take advice of any body ſtanding in no need of it; and to conclude, that they would obey none but me, and that I ſhould command as Sovereign, ſince they owned me for their Maſter.</p>
            <p>I pacified all by complying with the pleaſure of ſo many people, and the better to diſcover their thoughts appointed all to aſſemble the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their ſeveral Quarters, where I intended to go to learn them.</p>
            <p>The Abbot <hi>Baſqui,</hi> after his leaving my lodging, had conference with the Conſpirators, who being enraged to have failed of their deſign, and to ſee with what addreſs I had avoided ſo dangerous a ſnare as they had layed for me, and that my authority was the more confirmed, and themſelves entirely excluded from the part they pretended in the Government, met in a Church to reſolve of poniarding me: but not coming to a reſult either of the time or place for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their enterpriſe, they referred their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the night following: And in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Abbot <hi>Baſqui</hi> coming to take his leave of me, that he might return to the Fleet, there to expect the ſucceſs of his Conſpiracie, not thinking himſelf ſafe in <hi>Naples,</hi> where my power would not be able to prevent his being torn in pieces by the people, his deſign failing, and he diſcovered
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57207:155"/>
to be the author; but I detained him to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all that ſhould paſs in the Town.</p>
            <p>I went through all the Quarters, where having openly declared, what had paſſed overnight, and deſiring the ſenſe of the people, he was very much ſurpriſed to hear them with one voice declare, that it was their will I ſhould be abſolute Maſter, and that I ſhould act with Sovereign power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding my permiſſion to take and drag through the Streets all ſuch as pretended to oppoſe. This was followed by a general exclamation, that they would never own other authority than mine, that to make me Duke of their Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick was too farre below my deſerts, that they would therefore have me their King. This I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as I had twice done before, and on the ſame account, threatened to leave them, and ſhip my ſelf on the Fleet, if they continued obſtinate in that which was ſo unreaſonable, and out of ſeaſon. Then calling me their Father, Defender, and Protectour of their Eſtates, Lives and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, they with exceſſive Teſtimonies of reſpect and affection proteſted to live and die with me, and that they would neither be ſparing of their own bloud, nor that of their wives and children in order to ſerve me, or advance the leaſt of my Intereſts.</p>
            <p>The Abbot <hi>Baſqui</hi> was amazed at the great eſteem I had acquired in ſo ſhort a time, and to ſee all the houſes in a moment hung with Tapiſtry for my Paſſage, Flowers, Sweet waters and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits caſt from the Windows, Cloaks and Tapiſtry ſpred under my Horſes feet, Perfumes and Incenſe

burned before me, Men, Women and Children giving me thouſands of Benedictions, and ſuch Teſtimonies as were eaſily diſcerned to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, and to have nothing of flattery or diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. He ſaid he could never have believed what he had ſeen, I deſired him to give a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful account of it, and to let me underſtand the intentions of the Court; telling him that I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the inclinations of the people at my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that in a ſhort time by my addreſs and diligence I hoped to be able to put the Crown of <hi>Naples</hi> on the Kings Head, or he not accepting it, on his Brothers or Uncles, and I conjured him to ſpeak freely to me, to ſo important an affair, ſince I neither had nor ever ſhould have any other deſign than to make thoſe of <hi>France</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual whatſoever they might be. He aſſured me he had no inſtruction relating to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that all that he knew was that the King pretended nothing more than to ſee the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> driven out of <hi>Naples</hi>; they looſing the Kingdom, it was indifferent to him into what hands it fell, becauſe he ſhould from that derive a ſufficient advantage. I know not whether he was no better informed of the deſigns of <hi>France,</hi> or whether he would open himſelf no farther to me, that he might have ſtill pretence to complain of my conduct; but this is a great truth, that I could neither from him nor any of the Kings Miniſters reſiding at <hi>Rome</hi> ever learn in what manner they deſired I ſhould comport my ſelf. So that they neither can nor ought with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to blame my actions, which they would never regulate.</p>

               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:57207:156"/>His fear that I might comply with the Officers of the Fleet, and give them particular informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all, obliged him with all poſſible care to prevent the landing of the Gentleman the Duke of <hi>Richelieu</hi> ſent to complement me, to which purpoſe he cauſed him to be moſt ſollicitouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained aboard another ſhip, that he might not return to the Admiral till the Fleet was ready to ſet ſail, which evinces that it was not my fault that I had no correſpondence with the officers, which I earneſtly deſired.</p>
            <p>They ſent me word that for want of water they ſhould be forced to ſet ſail, if I provided them not, wherefore I preſently ſent them eight <hi>Felucca</hi>'s to fetch it, but this number being thought inſufficient, they took ſo ſlight a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to go for <hi>Portolongone,</hi> having done no other thing but expoſed me to a thouſand dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, from which, I may ſafely ſay, I eſcaped not without a Miracle, and had I not before eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed an extraordinary confidence in the people, I ſhould have been torn in an hundred pieces, when they found themſelves fruſtrated of all the ſuccors I had given them cauſe to hope, with ſo great probability, for which I was ſecurity, yet there remained now no more but my perſon alone to aſſiſt them.</p>

took two ſhips laden with Corn in my ſight, and ſent them to <hi>Portolongone,</hi> refuſed me the little Money I demanded for cauſing thoſe troops to ſubſiſt, whoſe landing I preſſed with ſo much importunity, furniſhed me with no more but ſix Barrels of Powder, and gave me no manner of aſſiſtance but by the arrival of the Knight <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> the Baron <hi>de la Garde,</hi> the Knight of <hi>Gent, Souillac, de Glandeveze,</hi> Baron <hi>Durand,</hi> Saint <hi>Maximin,</hi> afterwards Quartermaſter of my Guards, and <hi>Beauregard</hi> an Officer belonging to the Artillery, and uſed all poſſible endeavours to prevent the coming of theſe to me. I leave it to be judged if an other man, ſeeing himſelf ſo wretchedly abandoned, would not have loſt all courage as well as all hope? And whether I ſtood not in need of an extraordinary reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to reſiſt ſo ſpightful a fortune, and of as great addreſs to ſecure my ſelf from ſo apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? Notwithſtanding all which, this deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition renued my vigour, and ſeeing that all depended on my perſon, I employed my ſelf with ſo much care and fervency, that I did not onely avoid my own ruin, but came very near cauſing that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which will appear to ſuch as attentively read the remainder of theſe Memoires, whoſe verities are ſo extraordinary they will to many ſeem fabulous.</p>
            <p>I ſent next Morning for the Magiſtrates of the Town, and thoſe which till then had formed the body of a Council, and told them I had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that ſome amongſt them conſpired againſt my life, and had by night aſſembled themſelves
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57207:157"/>
in a Church to deliberate on ſuch an attempt; That being unwilling to dip my hands in bloud, I pardoned them with all my heart, conditionally that they repented, and took a different conduct, but if they obſtinately perſiſted in that wicked deſign, they ſhould feel the effects of my juſtice and rigor, ſince they neglected thoſe of my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and clemencie; with the aſſurance I gave them not onely to blot out of my memory ſo deteſtable a deſign, but neither to affect nor value them the leſs for the future; All were ſurpriſed at ſo great a moderation, thoſe that were guilty ſaid little, the reſt beſeeched me to nominate and puniſh them ſeverely, they being unworthy of pardon; and that if my goodneſs permitted me not to do it, I ſhould leave them to the people, whoſe ſeverity would terrifie all perſons capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch treacheries, and that ſuch an example was due to the publique, in whoſe name they conjured me to it on their Knees, I anſwered that if the Confederates in ſo black a reſolution had any honour left, they would be moved by my Clemency, and become affectionate and faithful to me, but if they perſiſted they would tire my patience, and I ſhould cauſe them to be puniſhed according to their deſerts.</p>
            <p>The night following they met again in another Church to conſult a ſecond time on their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. The next Morning I ſent for the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and told them the ſame things I had done the day before, that their ingratitude had wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me, and having pardoned them twice, if they a third time fell into the ſame fault, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

in the World ſhould be capable to ſecure them from my juſt revenge; In ſtead of altering their deſign, they contented themſelves to change the place of their meeting, of which having notice, I inſtantly ſent Officers of my Guard to ſecure them, and two of the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, for ſo many they were, demanding to be brought to me, that they might declare the whole Conſpiracy, I ſent for them, where caſting themſelves at my feet, they begged their lives, and gave me account of all they knew.</p>
            <p>By their Confeſſion I was informed that the Abbot <hi>Baſqui</hi> had told them I was an enemy to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> that I came to <hi>Naples</hi> not onely without its participation, but contrary to its orders, and that I was the cauſe the people received no ſupplies, that for this only reaſon the Fleet had neither landed Men, Ammunition, nor Artillery, and ſent to <hi>Portolongone</hi> the two ſhips laden with Corn, that had been taken in ſight of the Town. That others were ready to be ſent from <hi>Provence</hi> with all manner of Supplies, as ſoon as they ſhould have rid <hi>France</hi> of an enemy and rebel, and their City of a Tyrant, who under pretence of procuring them Repoſe and Liberty, endeavoured nothing but to gain credit amongſt them, that he might afterwards the more eaſily oppreſs them, and obtain the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority: That deſire to be aſſiſted with all things neceſſary to drive away the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> made them reſolve to remove the onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, that deprived them of the ſupport and protection of <hi>France</hi>; that their deſpair, by
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57207:158"/>
ſeeing themſelves abandoned; and the aſſurance of receiving all manner of ſupplies in abundance, had cauſed them to ſwear my deſtruction and undertake to ponyard me. That there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen in the Conſpiracy, but that <hi>Tonno Baſſo, Salvator de Gennaro,</hi> and <hi>Petro d' Amico</hi> were the moſt violent, and the heads of the enterpriſe; That there was beſides theſe a Prieſt called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millo Todino,</hi> and a Notary called <hi>Caldedino,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming afterwards all the reſt, which I remember not, it being ſo long ago; but that for themſelves they ever abominated this action, concealing their own thoughts to diſcover thoſe of others, and afterwards to give me account of all; that I might remember I had ordered them to ſeem diſſatisfied with me, and to engage amongſt ſuch as were ſuſpected to be ill affected. I did not onely pardon, but acknowledged my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to them, for freeing me from ſo great a danger, which in time and place convenient I would remember and reward. I then cauſed Paper and Ink to be brought them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to write down what they had declared to me, and ſubſcribe it: after which I ſent them Priſoners to the Vicary, and ordered the Auditor general to take the examinations of the reſt, and to confront them with thoſe two which I had pardoned, putting them on the Rack onely for forms ſake, to make their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions authentick, according to the cuſtom of the Country. The Confederates being all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them, reproched by their Conſciences, they neither made an abſolute denial, nor entire
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57207:159"/>
Confeſſion. Account was brought me of all that had paſſed, and conſidering the conſequence of this affair, and that theſe wretches would not fail to introduce <hi>France</hi> into their Confeſſions, and impute to its orders that which proceeded onely from the malice and diſloyalty of the Abbot <hi>Baſqui,</hi> I commanded the Auditor General to give the Heads of the Conſpiracy the torture or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary, and when they began to confeſs, cauſe the Notary, and other Officers of Juſtice, to avoid the room, and write their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions with his own hand, that they might be kept ſecret, ſo to conceal from the people all they ſhould ſay of <hi>France,</hi> which might produce ſome bad effect, by the pretence that ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this diſhonorable action, ſo contrary to the humour and cuſtoms of that Country, and of which the Abbot <hi>Baſchi</hi> was the onely author, being capable of and accuſtomed to the like villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and having undertook this to ſerve <hi>Spain</hi> advantangeouſly, by diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57207:159"/>
in Juſtification of the action, and to make it appear neceſſary, and undertaken only in order to the ſervice of <hi>France,</hi> and advantages of their Countrey, which could on no other account obtain ſuch ſuccours as were neceſſary for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Repoſe, Liberty, and Enfranchiſement from the oppreſſion of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; And that having acted on no other account but that of affection to his Country, it muſt needs have been glorious to have taken away the life of a tyrant and diſturber of the publick quiet. I ſent preſently to ſeek this Manifeſt which was brought me, to the ſame ſenſe and in the ſame manner expreſſed as he had told us. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the reſt of the Conſpirators were conformable, but to avoid effuſion of ſo much bloud, I expoſed none but the three Chiefs to the rigor of Juſtice, cauſing the reſt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Priſon, till I got opportunity of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſending them by Sea out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; The Wives and Relations of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned came with their hair diſheveled, and tearing their faces with their nails, according to the cuſtom of the Country, to move me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and caſt themſelves at my feet to beg their pardons, which I refuſed and could not have made good, though I had inclined to it, the people were ſo incenſed againſt them; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reiterated their attempts two or three days together, without obtaining any thing, they at laſt beſought me that execution might not be made in publick. I ſeemed unwilling to grant this, and ſuffered my ſelf to be a while impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57207:160"/>
to it, though I had before reſolved it, to prevent their publiſhing at their death, (what the Abbot <hi>Baſchi</hi> had falſly informed them of) that I was an enemy to <hi>France,</hi> and the cauſe ſhe ſent no ſupplies, and that it was for her ſervice, and with her participation that they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to poniard me; which I knew to be falſe, and was unwilling it ſhould be believed, or indeed ſuſpected. As ſoon as their heads were cut off they were ſet upon Poſts in the Market-place, and their bodies hung naked by one foot, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary puniſhment of Traitors, with inſcriptions importing that they had been executed as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, diſturbers of the publick quiet, and Conſpirators againſt me. This cruel Spectacle was very ſatisfactory to the people, and their joy was no leſs to ſee me delivered from ſo great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, which gave them ſo much horrour and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, as redoubled their affection and kindneſs for me.</p>
            <p>After this I diſpatched the <hi>Sieur de Taillade</hi> to Court, to give account of ſuch Negotiations as I had gone through, of the poſture in which I had put all affairs, of the demands I had made of ſuch ſuccours as the Fleet might have provided me with, of which I had received an abſolute refuſal; of the ill comportment of the Abbot <hi>Baſqui,</hi> of the convincing proofs I had that in ſtead of ſerving <hi>France,</hi> he had done nothing elſe but ſupport the intereſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and endeavour my particular ruine as well as that of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Country depending on it, of the Commotions he had incited to deſtroy me, of the artifices he uſed
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57207:160"/>
for attaining his end, of the ridiculous propoſal he made me concerning the Cardinal of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Cecilia,</hi> of his obſtructing the Reconciliation with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and in fine, of his Conſpiracy for killing me, with the Cauſe I had to complain of my ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs endeavours towards a correſpondence with the Officers of the Fleet, the want of which was maliciouſly imputed to me, as well as the omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they made at their arrival of deſtroying the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, which might have been effected with as much eaſe as little danger, laſt of all I mentioned their abandoning me after they had conſumed half my Proviſions, without ſupplying me with one grain of the lading of two Veſſels of Corn, they took from the enemy in my ſight, which had incenſed the people to the height of rage, and would have cauſed me to have been miſerably maſſacred, had I not been poſſeſſed of ſo great a credit amongſt them, that I could aſſure my ſelf to continue our affairs without falling into a worſe condition, till the return of the Fleet: That I beſought Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> on whoſe Friendſhip and Protection I thought I might ſecurely depend, to diſpatch immediately to me conſiderable ſupplies of Corn, Men, Money, Artillery, and Ammunition, without which it was impoſſible for me to ſubſiſt any longer; but if I might receive them I would engage to render the King ſervices more important than were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from me, and in a ſhort time deprive <hi>Spain</hi> of the Crown of <hi>Naples.</hi> I gave him very exact Inſtructions of all he was to negotiate on my behalf with the ſaid Lord Cardinal, and my
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57207:161"/>
Relations, whom I encharged him to preſs to ſupply me with Money, as ſpeedily and largely as was poſſible, becauſe on it depended my ſafety or ruine. Above all I commanded him to ſollicit Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> to ſend Inſtructions how I was to comport my ſelf, that I might not fail of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his Orders, and teſtifying by a blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, my fidelity, zeal and reſpect for the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> I ordered him to paſs by <hi>Rome</hi> to communicate all things with <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay,</hi> and deliver him my Letters.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Christmas</hi> Holy-days the <hi>Banditi</hi> I have formerly mentioned, encouraged by the hope I had given them of taking <hi>Averſa,</hi> and preſence of the Army, fought with greater vigor and to better purpoſe. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> attributed to my care and vigilance whatſoever happened to their diſadvantage, and thought my conduct had a greater ſhare in my ſucceſſes than my fortune.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Monteſarchio</hi> ſick of a quartan Ague went home ſome days before he had been ſuſpected to hold correſpondence with me, which yet was no other than his acknowledgements, for my having ſaved his Siſters from the peoples fury, and permitted him to live at quiet in his houſe; Their jealouſies increaſed when retiring into <hi>Apulia</hi> for ſome particular affairs, to ſecure his houſe from being pillaged in his abſence, I ſent a Commiſſion to one of his ſervants to command not only it, but all the <hi>Militia's</hi> of his other Lordſhips. In this manner I dealt as often as poſſibly I could with all the Nobility, to preſerve them their Eſtates, gain their good will by ſuch a
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57207:161"/>
Protection, and increaſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſtruſt of them, from which I expected very happy Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
            <p>I was likewiſe informed that <hi>Polito Pastena</hi> had poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Salerno,</hi> and marched to attacque <hi>Scafatta,</hi> whoſe Conqueſt would be of extraordinary importance to me, by making me maſter of the River of <hi>Sarno,</hi> and the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Wind-mils that made the Enemy ſubſiſt, in the Caſtles and Quarters they were poſſeſſed of in the Town, receiving all their Meal from thence. I was alſo told that <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Avellino,</hi> and raiſed Men for more conſiderable enterpriſes. <hi>Paponi,</hi> who till now had done nothing but run up and down the Country, and plunder on the banks of <hi>Garillano,</hi> accompanied by the two Brothers of <hi>Daretzo,</hi> had taken the Towns of <hi>Seſſa, Itri,</hi> and the Tower of <hi>Sperlonga,</hi> a Poſt very conſiderable, as being on the Sea-ſide. The <hi>Sieur de Laſcaris</hi> Nephew of the great Maſter of <hi>Malta,</hi> whom I had ſent to him, took in the City of <hi>Fondi,</hi> and this little body of an Army became conſiderable enough to be maſter of the Field, and in ſuch a manner block the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> that it cut off its correſpondence with the reſt of the Kingdom, and prevented its receiving any more ſuccors by land. <hi>Pietro Creſcentio,</hi> with ſeven or eight hundred men he had drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aſſaulted <hi>Montefuſculo,</hi> the Capital City of the Province that bears that name, and Seat of a Preſident, which is the title they give to gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Provinces, whom he forced to quit it,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57207:162"/>
and took it in a very ſhort time, his troops aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting from day to day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sabato Paſtore</hi> gave me advice from <hi>Apulia</hi> that he was ſo ſtrong that nothing could reſiſt him in the field from executing ſome conſiderable deſign, and I ſent him order to march ſtreight to the City of <hi>Fogia,</hi> a place famous for its fare, worth ſix hundred thouſand Crowns revenue, which conſiſts only in the Toll of Cattle, which paſs the Winter in the Plains of <hi>Apulia,</hi> and in the Summer go to ſeek their Paſture in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> of this he poſſeſſed himſelf in a very few days, and afterwards of the Cities of <hi>Luſcietae</hi> and <hi>Troia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one part of <hi>Calabria Truſſardo</hi> having made himſelf ſtrong began to be feared, and forced ſome places of importance, that made difficulty of declaring with us: and another part of the ſame Province demanded a Commander in Chief and ſome <hi>French</hi> Officer with him: I ſent a young advocate called <hi>Paris,</hi> a man of reſolution and vigor, accompanied by the <hi>Sieur de la Serre,</hi> who was no leſs ſucceſsful than others that in other places fought under my Commiſſions. In <hi>Baſilicata,</hi> and the land of <hi>Barri,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Vallio</hi> and <hi>Matheo Chriſtiano,</hi> drawing people together, made conſiderable Conqueſts, amongſt others of <hi>Altamura, Matera, Gravina, Caſſano,</hi> and <hi>Bitento.</hi> The <hi>Banditi</hi> began alſo to ſtir in <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> and many perſons ſent to deſire Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of me; The ſucceſs of my own men was no leſs fortunate; but as it arrived latter, I deferre it to be ſpoken of in its time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:57207:162"/>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> daily receiving ſo bad news, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſeriouſly to apprehend their ruin, ſeeing all things ſucceed ſo happily with me, that I effected whatſoever I undertook, and imagined they could no longer put confidence in the Nobility, with whom they were jealous I had a very good underſtanding, and particular correſpondence. To confirm them more in this opinion the Duke of <hi>Vairana</hi> caſting off his diſguiſe, ſent to deſire of me a Commiſſion for Camp-maſter General in the Country of <hi>Lavoro</hi> bordering on the <hi>Popes</hi> territory. The Duke of <hi>Vieteri,</hi> whoſe lands lie near <hi>Salerno,</hi> did not ſee how he could preſerve them without joyning with me, and arrived about this time at <hi>Naples</hi> to aſſure me of his ſervice and obedience. Many other perſons of high Birth and the moſt wealthy of the Kingdom, whoſe names it would be too tedious to particulariſe here, having withdrawn themſelves into the City of <hi>Benevento,</hi> ſent expreſsly to complement me in very obliging terms, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> moſt vehemently reſented.</p>
            <p>I thought I was not to continue idle my ſelf, and drawing troops together in the City, whom I cauſed to be met by the <hi>Militias</hi> of <hi>Nocera</hi> and <hi>la Cava</hi> ſent to attack the Greek Tower, which the Enemy had regained from us; it was taken in four and twenty hours, and from thence I ſent to beſiege the Caſtle of the Annunciation, giving the command of that Leager to Colonel <hi>Mello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>; The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſending to its aſſiſtance the Galley of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> the ſlaves that were in it revolted, took the Captain priſoner, and ran
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57207:163"/>
it aſhore in the place where three days before that of <hi>Tereſia</hi> had done the ſame thing. This Caſtle held out three days, which reſiſtance vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, I reſolved to go thither in perſon, but at my arrival found the enemy had abandoned it in the night. Having taken the <hi>Annunciato,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called the troops that had beſieged it, to ſend them away the next day to attempt <hi>Caſtelamare,</hi> by which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> received their Proviſions, not getting any thing from <hi>Capua,</hi> and <hi>Gaeta,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo unprovided that from thence nothing could be expected. But <hi>Melloni</hi> being very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in <hi>Naples,</hi> where he did the duty of Camp-maſter General, being the eldeſt of our Officers, I gave this imployment to the <hi>Sieur de Ceriſantes,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Commander having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of me. He took upon him the conduct of this little body, which being drawn up ready for march mutinied, and demanded Mony. I ſent to promiſe it and appeaſe the diſorder, but the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers forgot their reſpect for him, threatning to kill him if he preſſed them any farther. He came to acquaint me with it that I might redreſs it. I went immediately, and perceived the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers at my coming up to them blow and cock their matches, who preparing to fire upon me, preſented their Muſquets; I fiercely demanded who they were that diſtruſted my Promiſe, and refuſed to obey me; One of them firſt anſwered that he was one, and the reſt generally did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the like, I ſpurred right up to him and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my ſword through his body killed him. Are there any more, ſaid I, deſirous of dying by my
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57207:163"/>
hand? a Camerade of the others ſaid, Yes, he was; I replyed, You deſerve it not, but ſhall ſuffer that of the Hang-man, and ſeiſing upon him cauſed him to be diſarmed, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion taken by the Regiments Chaplain, made him be inſtantly hanged on a tree. The reſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at my Reſolution, layed down their arms and begged pardon. I then commanded them to march, and ſhewing them Money that I had brought for them, told them that as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their diſobedience they ſhould receive none in three days. After which I went along with them a quarter of a League, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Town, where I drew out ſome men to ſeiſe <hi>la Cerra,</hi> a Paſs of very great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to us, and ordered <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> to attacque the Town of <hi>Nola,</hi> which yielded in few days, ſending to make capitulations with me, which the ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, for which, as well as for his many other crimes, he was ſometime after puniſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gennaro</hi> and <hi>Vincenzo</hi> uniting, made uſe of this favourable conjuncture to ſet on foot the moſt dangerous encumbrance I met with whileſt I was at <hi>Naples,</hi> from which, having freed my ſelf with vigour and addreſs, I drew ſuch advantage from it as augmented my reputation. They cheriſhed underhand the averſion the raſcallity had for the better ſort of Citizens and civiler people, who by reaſon of the inſolencies ſuffered from them, juſtly hated them. The later of theſe by whom the greateſt part of the Virgins ſuburbs was inhabited, were called <hi>black Cloakes,</hi> and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57207:164"/>
the ordinary ſort of people took the name of <hi>Lazares</hi> at the beginning of the Revolutions, as the Revolters in <hi>Flanders</hi> formerly had done that of <hi>Beggars,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Guienne</hi> that of <hi>Eaters,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Normandy</hi> of <hi>Barefeet,</hi> and of <hi>Beauſſe</hi> and <hi>Soulongne</hi> of <hi>Wooden Pattins.</hi> Theſe <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zares</hi> that day which was the moſt glorious of my life, grown inſolent by our good ſucceſſes, went into the Virgins Suburbs peopled by thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or fourty thouſand inhabitants, to demand Money (on occaſion of the publick joy,) of the <hi>Black Cloaks</hi> with great inſolence, and a Gentleman anſwering that their pillagings had not left them in a Condition to beſtow libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, one of the rabble replied, he ſhould give him ſomething or he would pull off his beard, and attempting it, the Gentleman killed him with a Poniard, and got into his houſe, Theſe <hi>Lazares</hi> enraged at the death of their Companion, ſent preſently for aſſiſtance to the Market-place, and the other Quarters, from whence there came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning three or four thouſand people, and a furious skirmiſh was begun, yet with diſadvantage to the <hi>Lazares,</hi> who, beſides the body that made head againſt them in the ſtreet, were fired on out of the Windows. News of this being brought me as I roſe from Dinner, my firſt care was to ſend to double our Guards, fearing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not let ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>p ſo handſome an occaſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of our diſorder: And then I ſent <hi>Onofrio Piſacani</hi> with his Company to endeavour ſome means of remedying this unlucky accident. I haſtened after my ſelf followed by my Guards
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57207:164"/>
and three or four of my Servants, having diſpoſed all the reſt on our ſeveral Poſts, to be ready for whatſoever might happen, and to ſend me notice. I took along with me <hi>Mazillo Caracciolo</hi> Maſter of my horſe, who might do me good ſervice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſcreet perſon, beloved and eſteemed by all the Citizens, and capable of prevailing with thoſe of that Suburb, and the Nobility inhabiting it. I wore that day a Suit of the Italian faſhion, the onely one I made during my whole reſidence, which for want of Cloth not to be had in the Town, was of green Grogram of <hi>Naples</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Gold, which being very glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and remarkable, was neceſſary to make me diſtinguiſhed at a diſtance. At my arrival I found <hi>Onofrio Piſacani</hi> hurt in the hand by a Muſquet ſhot, who told me there was a ſtrange diſorder in the Suburb, that he had cauſed the gate of the Town to be ſhut, to prevent the great concourſe of people, which coming from all parts, increaſed the tumult, and rendered it more difficult to be appeaſed. I made a ſign with my hand to the people, who flocked together to hear me, and that I might put an end to the difference, forbad, on pain of life, that whole day to pronounce ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the words, <hi>Black Cloaks</hi> or <hi>Lazares,</hi> to mention treaſon or call any man rebel, all which would only have tended to a greater exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mens minds.</p>
            <p>I had ſcarce given over ſpeaking when I ſaw four or five Raſcals dragging a Chirurgion, who, very unluckily for him, wore black that day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Profeſſion, and calling him rebel,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57207:165"/>
traitor, and <hi>black Cloak,</hi> went about to kill him before my face; whileſt he caſt himſelf at my ſtirrup very much affrighted, a Butcher with a great Knife coming to cut his throat, I broke my Cane with a blow I gave him on the head, which laid him along at my feet, another crying out that the people would not ſuffer themſelves to be treated in ſuch a manner, I rid over him, and ſending them both to priſon, threatned to have them hanged before night. I had another Cane given me, which I broke upon other Mutineers, doing the like till I had diſpatched four, which allayed the tumult, and brought all the <hi>Lazares</hi> to begg my pardon on their Knees. At laſt cauſing the City gate to be opened, and leaving a guard upon it, I took along with me <hi>Mazillo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racciolo,</hi> Father <hi>Capece,</hi> and two or three Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to carry Orders, and coming into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs found the <hi>Lazares</hi> and <hi>black Cloaks</hi> fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, two or three thouſand men on either ſide; I called out to the people to make me way, and paſſing through the midſt of them, placed my ſelf between the two bodies, making ſign with my Hat to cauſe them to give over firing, which was done immediately, and with ſo great reſpect, that without any more acts of hoſtility, they with great attention hearkned to what I had to command them. Taking hold of the occaſion I told them, that with much ſorrow I perceived that all the pains I could take for reuniting the better and meaner ſort of people proved vain, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

one and the ſame intereſt obliged them to one nd the ſame inclination; that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion concerning them both, they ought both to have the ſame deſires of deliverance, and both joyn their endeavours to mine, that they might obtain liberty, and their ſidings being the greateſt obſtacles I met withal, put an end to them, to which I had till then vainly endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, by repreſenting their intereſts, to which they ought to ſacrifice their animoſities, if they loved their Country; but now in fine perceiving my reaſons and admonitions to be ſo little valued, I muſt neceſſarily have recourſe to more violent remedies to contain them within the bounds of their duty, and that I was ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this laſt diſorder, that I would uſe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt rigour by a great example to prevent any other of ſo dangerous concernment, of which the enemy would not have failed to have made ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage without the preventions I had made uſe of. I commanded two Wheels and four Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſes to be ſet up in the middle of the Suburb, by the puniſhment of ſuch as ſhould appear to have been the cauſers of this Commotion to terrifie others: at the ſame time I ordered all the <hi>black Cloaks</hi> to withdraw into the Convent of Saint <hi>Mary</hi> of Health, and ſent <hi>Mazillo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racciolo</hi> and Father <hi>Capece</hi> my Confeſſor to go with them to take particular information of what had paſſed, and of the beginners of this diſturbance, and to bring me account of it, after which I would declare my farther intentions. I was immediately obeyed, and they all went
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57207:166"/>
toward the place I had appointed them, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forbidden both ſides, on pain of their lives, to commit any act of Hoſtility: From them turning to the people, I gave them a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priment, for having undertaken to right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſtead of applying themſelves to me for Juſtice, by it hazarding the whole Town had I not provided againſt all attempts that might have been made, whileſt every man was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in his particular revenge, abandoning the publick defence to ſatisfie private animoſities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then demanding that they which began the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult might be delivered into my hands in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their puniſhment, it was found they were all ſlain, chance having become their executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I ſent an order to <hi>Aniello Porcio</hi> Auditor general to take informations on all ſides, that I might after order what I ſhould judge neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. I cauſed the gate of the Town to be opened and the people to return, enjoyning all to retire to their dwellings, and lay down their Arms, which was done in a moment, and then ſhutting the Gate, left my Guards there, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly forbidding any to be ſuffered to return into the Suburbs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazillo Caracciolo</hi> and Father <hi>Capece</hi> came to render me account of what they had done amongſt the <hi>black Cloakes,</hi> to whom I preſently went, to give them alſo a repriment, but different from that of the common people, telling them I was much ſurprized at this tumult, expecting more diſcretion from people of quality, of whom the greateſt part were Gentlemen; That under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57207:166"/>
the inſolence of the <hi>Lazares</hi> they ſhould not have concerned themſelves with them. That they ought to have retired into their houſes, and given me notice of the diſorder, without taking arms againſt thoſe that had not any; That I would preſently have come in and done them juſtice, cauſing the greateſt mutineers of that rabble to have been whipped through the Streets. That I beſought them for my ſake to be more diſcreet another time, and that I would have a particular care to ſecure them from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies. That if there were any amongſt them affected to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their inclinations better, which being uſeleſs to his ſervice, onely brought them into danger, hazarded the honour of their families, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the plundering their houſes, from which I would ſecure them, provided that by too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet a zeal, they diſcovered not themſelves ſo farre as would bind up my hands, and deprive me of occaſions of ſerving them according to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and that ſince the preſervation of my perſon was neceſſary to all they held moſt dear in the World, they ought ſeriouſly to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it, and not every day expoſe me to new dangers, their Lives and Honours depending only on my Protection; of which ſince my arrival they had ſeen ſo many teſtimonies in ſo many different rancounters.</p>
            <p>They heard me with as great patience as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and proteſted never to loſe the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Obligations to me, and that owing me all, they would employ all they had in the World
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57207:167"/>
for the ſafety and preſervation of my perſon, for which they would offer up their Vows and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers continually. In effect although moſt of them were concerned in the re-eſtabliſhment of <hi>Spain,</hi> the greateſt part of their revenues being ſettled on the taxes, and that they had a deadly hatred for the common people, who had ſo earneſtly ſought their ſuppreſſion, and highly affronted them, they were ſo ſenſible of the obliging way I made uſe of in what concerned them, that not only they and their whole Families mentioned me in their Prayers, but conceiving their ruine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from mine, they moſt ſollicitouſly watched for my ſafety, diſcovering to me all Conſpiracies were made againſt my life, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing me of all ſuch deſigns of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as might be dangerous to my perſon. I gave them aſſurance they might every one go home and continue there without fear, ſince I took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me their Defence and Protection.</p>
            <p>Preſently after I got a horſeback, and rode about the Suburbs, to ſee all things ſetled in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and ſecurity, and gallopping as faſt as I could towards a Street where I heard a Muſquet fired, I met a Gentlewoman weeping, who caſting her ſelf on her knees before me, demanded juſtice for the death of her brother, whom a Souldier belonging to a Company I had met in that Street, had killed with a Muſquet ſhot as he ſtood at his Window; I demanded of the Captain who it was that notwithſtanding my prohibition had ſhot, it having been done not farre from him, and he replying he knew not, laying hold on his Belt
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57207:167"/>
I cauſed him to be diſarmed, and delivered him to one of my Guards, telling him his life ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the fact of his Souldier, and commanding Father <hi>Capece</hi> to alight to confeſs him, I ſent for the Hang-man, whom I had cauſed to be brought into the Suburbs, by the terrour of his preſence, to hold all in reſpect and duty. The Captain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted begged his life, with aſſurance that he would deliver the Souldier that was guilty, which he did immediately, and the truth of it being confirmed by other teſtimonies, I made the Captains arms be reſtored him, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him as ſoon as execution ſhould be done, at which I would have him be preſent, to return with his Company into the Town. The Criminal after his Confeſſion having been hanged by my order at the barrs of the Window of the deceaſed, his death was immediately revenged, and his ſiſter (as much as poſſibly could be) comforted by ſo ſpeedy juſtice. At laſt having rid round the Suburb, and hearing a noiſe in a houſe in a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane, I haſtened thither, and ſaw Serjeant Major <hi>Gennaro Griffo,</hi> Son to the old Colonel <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew Griffo,</hi> of whom I have formerly ſpoken, whom eight or nine raſcals armed, ſome with Poniards, and ſome with great Knives, dragged on the ground; others the mean while ſetting their ſwords at his breaſt, ready to kill him with many wounds, I commanded them to leave him and be gone, but ſeeing that in ſpight of my order they perſiſted, I leapt from my horſe with my Sword in my hand, and having entered the houſe l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ied about me, to cauſe them to let him
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57207:168"/>
go The poor Gentleman caſting himſelf at my feet beſought me to ſave his life, I embraced him with my left arm, and with the right put by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral thruſts the raſcals made at him in my arms, which without extraordinary good fortune had ſlain him with me. I puſhed him into a low Chamber, and going out in purſuit of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, overtook him that had made the laſt thruſt, which I had put by, and which had paſſed two foot beyond my body, I made ſo violent a thruſt at him that I caſt him down two paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from me, my ſword having bended even to the Hilt without entring, by lighting on a place (happily for him) where one of the skirts of his Buff Coat hung over the other; and getting haſtily up he ran away with his Companions, whom I followed laying upon them with my ſword till I came to the great Street of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urb, where I found fourteen or fifteen hundred men in arms, who having paſſed through other Gates of the Town came together on the rumor of what paſſed in the Suburb. I threatned to have them ſeverely puniſhed for returning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my order, and commanding them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to return into the Town, whoſe Gate I had cauſed to be opened, I wondered to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they durſt not go and asking the reaſon, they told me they were affraid I would ſtrike them with my Sword: I ſet its point on the ground, and leaning upon it, gave them my word not to ſtrike them, if they obeyed me. They threw down their arms, and falling on their Knees begged my pardon. By this teſtimony
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57207:168"/>
of Submiſſion I judged I might yet do ſomething more, and ſending one of my Guards for <hi>Gennaro Griffo,</hi> let him know he ſhould come on my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role, and that it concerned his ſafety ſo to do. At his arrival I took him by the left hand, and turning to the people, ſaid, Look on this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I affect and value him, and have taken him into my Protection, in ſuch manner that if any of you diſ-reſpect or injure him, the whole world ſhall not ſave the party offending from hanging; Where are thoſe that even now would have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him? let them come forth, I will pardon them for his ſake, but I will have them beg it of him on their Knees, and come and kiſs his feet; This they did with all imaginable teſtimonies of repentance and ſubmiſſion. Then embracing him, I told him in all their hearing, he might reſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure at home, and that if any hereafter gave him the leaſt offence, I would ſo ſeverely puniſh it, that the Example ſhould make all the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect him. He withdrew with many acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements of his obligation to me, and very much ſatisfied in ſo good a Protectour I got on horſeback again, and cauſing all the people to return into the Town by Saint <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s Gate, made it be ſhut again, and fetching another round about the Suburb, finding all things quiet returned by the Gate of <hi>Capua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was no ſooner in the Town but I heard an alarm at one of the Poſts, whither I made haſte. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſuppoſing me wholly taken up in pacifying the diſorder they heard was in the Virgins Suburb, thinking to make advantage by
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57207:169"/>
my abſence, intended to attempt ſomething about the Quarter of Saint <hi>Clare,</hi> but they found themſelves much deceived when by the cries of all the Souldiers of Long live his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> our Protectour, they were aſſured of my Preſence, which obliged them to retreat without any more firing.</p>
            <p>At my coming home I found the Wives and Siſters of thoſe wretches I had ſent to priſon, who with diſheveled hair and tears in their eyes implored their pardon. This day had been ſo glorious, and I was ſo well pleaſed that I could refuſe nothing, I therefore readily granted their requeſts, and that very inſtant ſent to give their Husbands and Brothers liberty, on condition they ſhould afterwards be more diſcreet and reſpective. My thoughts highly ſatisfied with ſo glorious a day, I went home to refreſh my ſelf after the toil it had given me, and to conſider all night at my eaſe what I was to do next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and the better to eſtabliſh Government and Order in the Citie, I began ſuch a manner of life as I thought neceſſary to it, which will appear very rational though difficult to practiſe by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons leſs vigorous and laborious than my ſelf, which none could have undergone to whom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had given a leſs able body.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I aroſe in the Morning, whileſt I dreſſed me, I took account of all that had paſſed at our attacques in the night, and the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable perſons of the Town informed me of all diſorders that required redreſs, and gave me their opinions concerning all that was to be done in
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57207:169"/>
the day; After that I placed my ſelf in my Hall under a State, leaning againſt a Table, to give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular audiences, my Suiſs Guards ſtanding on each ſide to ſuffer but one at a time to approach me, that ſo they which ſpoke to me might nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be interrupted nor over-heard, a Gentleman ſtanding by me, into whoſe hands I gave all the Petitions were preſented me, having eſtabliſhed the order of making addreſſes by writing, to avoid confuſion and help my memory, hearing nevertheleſs what every one had to ſay, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving preſent anſwers to all affairs whoſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would admit them; from thence I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Maſs in a Sedan, every <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> to our Lady of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> and on other dayes to ſuch other Churches where there were ſome particular ſolemnities, or to ſuch Cloyſters of Nuns where Ladies of Quality reſided, by their means to hold correſpondence with their Relations, to know of them what I might do for their ſervice, acquire their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and engage them in my Concernments by the care I took to oblige them on all occaſions. By the way I cauſed my Sedan to ſtop, whileſt I ſpoke with all ſuch as had any thing to ſay to me: women came with Suits, which I either granted or refuſed, according to equity, without delaying them, and moſt commonly having a Pen and Ink carried along to write anſwers on Petitions, I did it as often as I could poſſibly. I gave out over night where I intended to go to Maſs next Morning, that Ladies of Quality might repair thither, they not coming home to me, it being
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57207:170"/>
contrary to the cuſtom of the Country. After Maſs was ended, I ſpoke to them to know if they had any thing to pretend of me, and having heard them one after another, I ſigned on the Rails of the Altar ſuch diſpatches as they deſired, for their Husbands, Brothers, or Kinſmen; At my return, whileſt my meat was ſerved up, I again gave audience to all that pretended to it, and then went to Dinner, during which my Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick played which was of the beſt in <hi>Europe.</hi> It was often interrupted either by ſuch as had ſome intelligence to bring me, or ſome other thing to ſay, or for the ſigning diſpatches. When I roſe from table I called for my horſes, and till my ſervants had dined continued to give audience: As I rid I ſtayed my horſe at the corner of every Street, where I ſaw people gather together, to hear all complaints that might be made me, and inform my ſelf of all neceſſities, that I might ſupply them; in this manner I rid about the Streets, which I found always hung with Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and perfumes were burned, as I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related, and as ſoon as my Pictures could be had I ſaw them erected at all turnings of the Streets under States with perfuming pots before them. I viſited without failing all the Poſts, and gave all neceſſary Orders. Afterwards I rid out of Town to take the air, and moſt commonly to <hi>Poggio Reale</hi> where the Gardens and Fountains are the moſt delicious of the World: Otherwiſe I cauſed my horſes to be ridden in my preſence, and many times mounted them my ſelf. Towards Evening I went homewards, hearing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57207:170"/>
by the way with all that were deſirous of it. When I came home I again gave audience, which being finiſhed, the Officers commanding the ſeveral Poſts and Quarters came for Orders, and Tickets for receiving Powder, which I gave according to the occaſion I found they had of it. The Knight <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> in whom I had an entire confidence, diſtributed it to them, having put it into his cuſtodie after I found that <hi>Aniello de Falco</hi> General of the Artillery was too free of it, not knowing how to refuſe any that demanded it, and after diſcovery of ſo great abuſe in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that it was ſometimes ſold to the Enemie.</p>
            <p>The City Magiſtrates came every Evening according to the Order I had given them, and I then conferred with them of all means for making the people ſubſiſt, and ſupplying them with all things neceſſary. Wine of which we had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance was ſo cheap that the beſt coſt but two pence a quart, which made a very good amends to the people for all ſuch other Proviſions as were leſs plentiful. Butchers meat was ſold for two pence a pound, only <hi>Veal</hi> which is there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted moſt delicate for three pence; and in like manner Gammons of Bacon, Lard, and other Salt-meats; We had from the Country ſo great plenty of Fowl and Veniſon that they bore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no price. We had great abundance of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons more delicious than thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> In ſhort, bread excepted, which was ſomething dear, all things neceſſary not onely to eating but feaſting were cheaper than in any other
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57207:171"/>
place in the World, and we had extraordinary fair and delicate fiſh at very low rates. I took ſo exact care of preſerving our Corn, that I reſolved every night with the Magiſtrates the weight and price of the bread that was to be ſold next day, appointing what Corn ſhould be ſent to be ground, and what quantity of Meal diſtributed amongſt the Bakers, ſuffering nothing to be drawn from the publick Granaries without Tickets under my hand: and to avoid diſorder and confuſion, I appointed what Ovens ſhould bake for the Souldiers, leaving all the reſt to the uſe of the Inhabitants of the Town. At night the Bakers paid in the price of the Corn that had been taken out of the Granaries; and the Mony was laid up to buy more, and ſome Loaves of thoſe that were to be ſold were brought me that I might ſee whether they were according to the weight and quality ordained. We never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fruit, roots and herbs, and having great quantity of <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, it was mixed amongſt the courſer Bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the poorer ſort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bought the cheaper. Beſides all which, the Country people after we became maſter there, brought Bread to ſell in the Town every Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For Oats and Forrage for our Horſe we never were in any great want of them.</p>
            <p>The Regulating of all theſe matters belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the City Magiſtrates, I ſpent part of the Evening with them, after which I retired to my Chamber, where ſometimes going into my bed to refreſh my ſelf, I cauſed ſome Officer of the Exchequer, a civil and criminal judge, with ſome
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57207:171"/>
one of the Council of Saint <hi>Clare,</hi> to give me their opinions on the different Subjects of the Petitions that had that day been preſented me, which I ordered to be read before me. This ſometimes imployed me two or three hours; for I never paſſed any by without a grant or a refuſal, cauſing a Liſt of all ſuch as had been preſented to be hung up in the Morning at my Secretaries Office, where every one might ſee whether his buſineſs had ſucceſs or failed, and this with ſuch punctuality, that I never delayed any to another day. But for my refreſhment in ſo great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, we drank all ſorts of iced waters which are made better and more deliciouſly in <hi>Naples</hi> than in any other part of <hi>Italy:</hi> afterwards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing the Magiſtrates I called for Supper, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſome with whom I was moſt intimate and familiar, to divert and entertain my ſelf with them. After I had ſupped, walking about my Chamber, I had all the diſpatches I had that day received out of the Country read, appointing anſwers, and in my preſence cauſing extracts to be made of the principal Matters: My Letters were drawing up all night, and as ſoon as I waked in the Morning brought me to ſign. But for what concerned my Negotiations with the Nobility, that I might keep them ſecret, I ſhewed no man the Letters I received, and writ all anſwers with mine own hand. Three hours of the night were uſually paſſed before I went to bed, and I appointed my Chamberlains to wake me, to ſpeak with all ſuch as had any thing to ſay to me, which uſually happened five or ſix times
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57207:172"/>
in a night: but conſidering the Condition I was in, I thought I ought to neglect nothing, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that amongſt many uſeleſs Relations, I might poſſibly learn ſomething of Importance. And of what age, quality, or ſex ſoever the parties were that deſired to ſpeak with me, they had an immediate admittance. This was the manner of my life, and I may ſafely ſay, that during the ſpace of five moneths, I neither eate nor ſlept in quiet.</p>
            <p>I was deſirous to remedy the confuſion cauſed in the Town by the idleneſs of ſuch as bore arms, the inſolencies which Souldiers going up and down in troops might the more eaſily act, the inconveniencies cauſed by the ſhops being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſhut up, the neceſſity to which handicrafts people were reduced for want of work, and the tyranny exerciſed on the poor Citizens, by ſuch as ſold Proviſions with their arms lying by them: to which purpoſe I made Proclamation, and cauſed it to be poſted up at the Corner of every Street, commanding all Artificers to return to work in their Callings, and all Tradeſmen to open their Shops: forbid all Souldiers to go up and down the Town in bodies, to carry any fire arms, or beat Drums, unleſs at the hours of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Watch, and all Officers to be followed by their Souldiers in Arms when they went about their particular buſineſs, or to buy any thing, but eſpecially when to ſpeak to the Magiſtrates, or ſollicite and receive their pay: that no Butchers, Bakers, or others ſelling Proviſions ſhould have any fire or other Arms about them, or upon
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57207:172"/>
their Stalls, whileſt they ſold their ware, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints having been made that ſome of them had been ſo inſolent, as to exact on poor people, forcing them to take ſuch things as they liked not, and at rates they had not agreed on, as alſo all fraud in weights and meaſures, and enhancing the Prices ſet by order on all Proviſions; and this on pain of death.</p>
            <p>This Proclamation was ſo exactly obſerved, that from that day the City of <hi>Naples</hi> enjoyed more repoſe and quiet, than it had ever done in time of the moſt ſettled peace: All ſhops were opened and furniſhed with all manner of Ware; Traffique went forward with as much ſecurity as liberty; no theft was committed, no arms ſeen, nor noiſe heard. Artificers gained their livings by their work as before the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all people lived with greater eaſe and tranquillity than ever. That order the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could never eſtabliſh in the time of their moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Authority, and which I cauſed to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at the very inſtant of declaring my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſurpriſed all the World, who could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it poſſible, and drew from all a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and affection.</p>
            <p>Things were in this condition when the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> that ſought to deſtroy me, by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring every day to raiſe ſome new Commotion, made uſe of the Duke of <hi>Turſi,</hi> whom they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as very conſiderable amongſt the people, for carrying on ſome enterpriſe. He applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a Serjeant Major called <hi>Alexio,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the credit of the Popes <hi>Internuncio</hi>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:57207:173"/>
for gaining him a Prieſt, called <hi>Joſeph Scopa,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a meeting with him: of which an account being given me, I could hardly perſwade my ſelf, that a perſon of his age and condition could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſuffer himſelf to be tranſported to ſuch an exceſs, by an inconſiderate zeal for <hi>Spain,</hi> which would not have been excuſable in a young man.</p>
            <p>Theſe two perſons aſſured me he would not fail to be at the rendezvous appointed, and that they had already diſcovered he had an intention to propound a deſign upon my perſon, and at the ſame time to give the enemy an entrance into the Town; That they had well laid their plot, and aſſured me the next day, which was the fourth of <hi>January,</hi> to bring me his head. I forbad them on pain of death, to injure his perſon, and told them I would have nothing to do with their buſineſs, unleſs they could deliver him to me in perfect health; but above all that they ſhould be very careful to diſguiſe nothing, nor engage my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role for the Duke of <hi>Turſi</hi>'s ſecurity, whom I eſteemed too prudent to put himſelf into their hands on any other account, or truſt perſons that had no character to make authentick the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they ſhould give him. I gave them leave to take all their <hi>Meaſures</hi> againſt the next day in the afternoon, and appointed them to come at my riſing and receive my farther Orders, and give me account of all they had negotiated They came punctually at the hour, and told me that the Duke of <hi>Turſi,</hi> with the <hi>Internuncio,</hi> his grand-child the Prince of <hi>Avella,</hi> and <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi>'s Secretary, would be at three of the Clock
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57207:173"/>
in the Church of the Fathers of <hi>Luca,</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>Chiaye:</hi> they deſired men to lie in ambuſh, and would be reſponſible upon their Lives to bring me within two hours the Grand-father, Grand-child, and <hi>Don John</hi>'s Secretary, and poſſibly himſelf, who they were told would be perſonally at this Conference. I commanded them above all to be careful no way to offend the perſon of the <hi>Internuncio,</hi> which ought to be ſacred as well to them as me, for on the Popes being for or againſt us abſolutely depended the ruine or eſtabliſhment of our affairs.</p>
            <p>At the hour appointed the Duke of <hi>Turſi</hi> came with his Grand child the Prince of <hi>Avella,</hi> about eighteen or nineteen years of age, and <hi>Don Proſpero Suardo,</hi> a Gentleman of much wit, and a great Enemy of the people; word was ſent me that <hi>Don John</hi>'s Secretary was gone to fetch his Maſter, who, the reſt told them, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to come, to confirm all ſuch advantageous conditions as he had promiſed in behalf of the people, and that if I would have a little patience they might take him priſoner with the reſt. I judged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would never conſent to his hazarding himſelf ſo lightly, and that to do ſomthing more extraordinary we ſhould looſe the opportunity already in our hands, I therefore ſent them word they ſhould content themſelves with the perſons of the Duke of <hi>Turſi,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Avella,</hi> and <hi>Don Proſpero Suardo,</hi> and fearing the peoples inſolence, and that ſome of the Plot might be barbarous enough to kill them by the way, I ſent the Company of my Guards for their
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57207:174"/>
Convoy, with three Sedans to bring them more at their eaſe, and ordered the Captain to make them a Complement on the occaſion of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and bring them to me to the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> where I would expect them. The Duke of <hi>Turſi</hi> did not very handſomely receive my Civility, more troubled at his own imprudence, to have in ſuch a manner rendred himſelf into the hands of the people, than at his impriſonment; and very much tranſported with heat enough told <hi>Augustine de Lieto</hi> that when with his Gallies he met him paſſing in a <hi>Felucca</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> had he believed him engaged in my ſervice, he would have cauſed him to have been hanged at the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of the Admiral. The people were all in arms as he paſſed by, and he was ſhewed the Shambles provided with meat in abundance, great quantity of Wild-fowl, Poultry and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon, and in the Market-place Tables of Bread, which ſeemed the remainder of what had been ſold all day; all which ſtruck him to the heart having ſeen nothing but miſery and poverty amongſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He found a foot-guard drawn up before the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Cloyſter where I lay, my Suiſs on each ſide the Stairs, and my other Guards in the Hall, being returned from waiting on him, and five and twenty footmen, every one a torch of white Wax in his hand, my apartment richly furniſhed and full of lights. I cauſed him to be met at my Stair-foot by thirty Gentlemen; and Fifty Officers, my ſelf ſtaying for him in my Hall, with <hi>Gennaro,</hi> ſome of the Nobility, all the Heads of the people, and the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57207:174"/>
chief Officers of the Army: I received him with all kindneſs and honour imaginable, leading him into my Chamber, where being ſeated, we entered upon very ſerious diſcourſe, which began by a Complement I made him, relating to his misfortune, telling him that all that wore ſwords were ſubject to the like accidents, which ought neither to aſtoniſh nor ſurpriſe a perſon of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and diſcretion as he was. That whatſoever advantage I might derive from his captivity, I could not avoid being ſenſible of his affliction, which I would endeavour to mitigate by all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities and ſervices poſſible; that I aſſured him of receiving from me ſuch uſage as I my ſelf would wiſh, if misfortune had put me in his place: but if I might freely expreſs my thoughts without offending him, I muſt needs tell him I could not have believed that a perſon of his years and experience would have entruſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the hands of a Prieſt and a Souldier of fortune, to whoſe word ſo much confidence ought not to be given, becauſe, beſides that they have not enough of honour to keep it, they come alſo ſhort in credit, not being in a condition ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently elevated to enable them to comply with it, nor to give aſſurance for performance though deſirous of it. That ſome days were paſſed ſince their acquainting me that they had treated with him, which they would not have continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my permiſſion; and that without any deſign of repreſenting to him the Obligation he had to me, I muſt needs acquaint him that their firſt intention was to have cut off his head and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57207:175"/>
brought it to me; that abhorring this propoſal I forbad them to attempt any thing againſt his life, for which their own ſhould be reſponſible, but if they could bring him to me without any farther prejudice to him, I approved their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and would recompence it as a remarkable ſervice; but on the other ſide, what profit ſoever our party might receive, by depriving our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of a head ſo able for Councel, and a perſon ſo capacitated by valour and experience to render them conſiderable ſervices, I would rather let them enjoy him, and looſe all the advantages I might obtain by his impriſonment, than ſee him whoſe merit, birth, vertue, and honour, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me not onely ſo great eſteem, but veneration for him expoſed to any danger on my account. He thanked me for ſo obliging a diſcourſe, and acknowledged he had very lightly expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and plaied the part of a young man, but that he would have hazarded much more for the ſervice of his King, and that having to deal with a faithleſs and rebellious people, it was neceſſary to ſacrifice himſelf, ſince there was not a man in the Town capable of giving him aſſurance, beſides my ſelf, to whom he had no reaſon to make his overture, the principal point of his negotiation being againſt me, as againſt the moſt dangerous enemy of <hi>Spain</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on whoſe misfortune or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity depended her good or evil ſucceſs. You ſee (I replyed) the particular care heaven takes of my preſervation, ſince it ſo ſeverely puniſhes deſigns againſt my perſon: he told me he found it to his coſt, but that I was too generous to wiſh
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57207:175"/>
him harm, for endeavouring by all means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Crown on the head of a Maſter, to whoſe intereſts his honour, duty and inclination ſo powerfully engaged him. That he pitied me for having concerned my ſelf in an enterpriſe that muſt needs at laſt ruine me, and that would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably coſt me my life and honour. That a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my quality and merit ought indeed to ſeek occaſions of imploying his courage, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch Gallant actions as I daily did, but that ſhould be more juſt and honourable, and in a better cauſe. That he was aſhamed to ſee one, that ought to be at the head of Royal Armies, (the Command whereof could not be wanting to me, which ſide ſoever I would follow, whether <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi>) become the leader of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted people, that ſuch an imployment, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of me, would blaſt all the glory I could ever acquire, by actions never ſo extraordinary, and that in the attempts I made I was to fear all, and had nothing to hope for. That the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy was ſo powerfully eſtabliſhed, and firmly ſupported, that none could ever expect to ſhake it unpuniſhed, that if the Conſequences of my good fortune extended ſo farr as to diſturbe her, ſhe would ſend ſuch Forces both by Land and Sea as would ſoon over-power me; That my ambition had already given ſo great jealouſie to <hi>France,</hi> that I was to expect no more aſſiſtance from thence, that the departure of the Fleet made this apparent enough, which refuſed to land me any ſupplies, and choſe rather not to deſtroy the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, which with eaſe and without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57207:176"/>
it might have done, than to gain a Victory would have been uſeful to my eſtabliſhment. That the deſigns of <hi>France</hi> tending onely to poſſeſs her ſelf of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſhe gladly ſaw the people deſtitute of all aſſiſtance, that neceſſity and deſpair might oblige them to caſt themſelves into her arms That I ſhould be conſidered as her greateſt enemy, my particular intereſt obliging me to oppoſe her advantages, and looking upon me as her main obſtacle, ſhe would by all manner of ways endeavour my ruine, as I might have perceived by the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy carried on againſt me by one of her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. That the people which now obeyed me with joy, would forſake me as ſoon as fortune ceaſed to be favourable to me; That good events being the cauſes of their affection, the contrary would render me not onely odious but criminal; that they would make me reſponſible for the firſt ill ſucceſs; That the Example of the Prince of <hi>Maſſa,</hi> muſt needs give me continual apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that I was daily expoſed to poiſon, aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſedition, and that he better than I, underſtanding their humour to be diſtruſtful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, turbulent, and cruel, aſſured me that in recompence of all the ſervices I had done them, I ſhould not at laſt avoid being torn in pieces and dragged through the Streets; That by ſuch a bloudie ſacrifice they would hope to appeaſe the indignation of <hi>Spain</hi>; that there were in the Town perſons diſcerning enough to judge they muſt one day return to the obedience of their firſt Maſter. That the civiller and better ſort of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57207:176"/>
people were already convinced of this truth, and as ſoon as the eyes of the reſt ſhould be opened, they would have recourſe to their Kings Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, the effects of whoſe bounty they might (when they pleaſed) enjoy, for which he would be reſponſible, and his head the ſecurity: That the care I took to prevent aſſaſſinations and Plunderings would deſtroy me, ſince the rabble finding no more profit in rebellion would be weary of the toil of it, and of bearing arms without reward for their labors, and the firſt to ſubmit, as ſuppoſing they had nothing to fear, being a victime unworthy their maſters Juſtice, who having contempt for them would be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the puniſhment of ſome of their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. That the Nobility, without whoſe reuniting I could never effect any thing, whoſe honour was equal to their birth, would never be enticed from their duty, and would have an eternal hatred for me, looking on me as their Countries tyrant, and an ambitious Prince that would attempt the Sovereignty, that prevented their revenging themſelves on the common people, for plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their houſes, maſſacring their Relations, and all other outrages received from them. That the long friendſhip he had formerly for my deceaſed Father, and now for me, obliged him to conjure me ſeriouſly to take care of my ſelf, as being nearer a Scaffold than a Throne, that as I had juſt cauſe to complain of <hi>France</hi> for abandoning me, ſo onely <hi>Spain</hi> could give me ſatisfaction, if I would have recourſe to her, and that he would be reſponſible, that as ſhe had moſt powerfully
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57207:177"/>
aſſiſted my Predeceſſors in the time of the League, if I had any thoughts of revenge, as to ſpeak freely the uſage I had received muſt needs incite me to it, I ſhould find conditions of the higheſt advantage. I replied that as I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed matters the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were in greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers than my ſelf, that I had already deprived them of Correſpondence with any part of the Kingdom, and conſequently cut off their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which I knew they wanted, and we in few days ſhould abound with: that in a ſeaſon ſo contrary to Navigation bad weather would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their receiving any by Sea. That they had been about to have abandoned all that they were poſſeſſed of in the Town, and the Caſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for want of wherewithal to maintain them, that they had been reduced to ſo great extremity, that Proviſions remained for no longer than four and twenty hours, had not the Galley ſo fortunately ſupplied them; that ſuch Miracles were not ſeen every day. That though they had a powerful Fleet, he knew well it was uſeleſs for want of Marriners and Souldiers, of whom they had not enow to man their Poſts. That their Gallies being by his impriſonment deſtitute of a Commander, and none to be found of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſufficient for ſupplying his place, they could do little or no ſervice. That the <hi>French</hi> Fleet would quickly return its Officers with ſo poſitive Orders, that they would not fail of their duty, nor any more (as they had done) let ſlip an occaſion of deſtroying the Fleet of <hi>Spain,</hi> which would eaſily be recovered, ſince at their return
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57207:177"/>
they would find it more weak and leſs provided than before. That I had ſent a Gentleman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France</hi> to give account of all that had paſſed, of which they had but confuſed notions; That I was aſſured of all manner of ſupplies, that the Fleet went away only to water, and joyn with a conſiderable number of ſhips that were arming in <hi>Provence,</hi> and that it would ſuddenly return by the one half ſtronger than before. That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed me many Ships laden with Corn, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and Souldiers to be landed, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three Weeks were paſſed I ſhould have a conſiderable body of <hi>French,</hi> and the beſt Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of our Kingdom, to land when I ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, and in ſuch part as I ſhould judge convenient. That the Court was too well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in my zeal and fidelity for the Crown to diſtruſt me, and that I acted not but according to the inſtructions I received. That the King had no thought of invading the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> but would give its people all manner of aſſiſtance, without other intereſt than that of protecting ſuch as apply themſelves to him, as he had moſt gloriouſly made appear in ſo many parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> that he would ſatisfie himſelf in dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of a Kingdom they had ſo long a time tyranniſed, and leave to the choice of thoſe of the Countrey what Government they would erect, and what Maſter ſubmit to, if they judged it neceſſary to have one, and would own and ſupport with all his power, whomſoever they ſhould raiſe to their Throne; that he would give no jealouſie to <hi>Italy,</hi> his deſigns tending only
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57207:178"/>
to its repoſe and liberty. That the ſuppreſſion of his enemies ſufficiently elevated his power, and he would gain enough by an alliance with all thoſe Sea and Land Forces they ſhould loſe with the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which were the moſt conſiderable that had oppoſed the courſe of his Victories. That his Gallies would find little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> now they had loſt ſo conſiderable an Admiral as the Duke of <hi>Turſi:</hi> and that for what concerned my ſelf who was more obedient than in former times the Baſhaws of <hi>Turkie,</hi> he doubted not of my bringing him my head with the account of my actions at fight of the firſt Order he ſhould ſend me. That the ill Conduct of the Abbot <hi>Baſchi</hi> was not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Court, no more than the Conſpiracy he made againſt my life. That our Nation never contrived ſo horrid deſigns, which its generoſity could not put in practice. That he, much better than my ſelf, underſtood what <hi>Genius</hi> inſpired that Gallant, becauſe he was a Pentioner of <hi>Spain,</hi> that this truth ſhould ſuddenly be made very apparent, and I blamed to have let him go unpuniſhed, which he ſhould not have done but for my reſpect to his Character. That the power of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy was no longer to be apprehended as formerly, that it was exhauſted both of Men and Money, and could onely make a feeble defenſive War in <hi>Flanders, Catalonia,</hi> and the Dutchie of <hi>Milan.</hi> That he ſhould quickly hear of the Siege of <hi>Cremona</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi>'s declaring for us, and that he attacquing them as vigorouſly there as I did in this Country,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57207:178"/>
they would be in no condition to make reſiſtance. That I was already Maſter of the Field through the whole Kingdom, and that I would ſuddenly be ſo of the City and its Caſtles. That I had ſo many Forces diſperſed in ſeveral Quarters, that whenſoever I pleaſed to give them a rendezvous, I could draw together above twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men. That the enemies no longer daring to appear were blocked up in their fortifications, which muſt of neceſſity fall ſhortly into my hands, becauſe unprovided of all things, and without men enow to defend them. That the people of <hi>Naples</hi> were no longer cruel nor turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; that I had brought them to my lure; That my care had reduced them to ſo good order and diſcipline, that in ſtead of inſolencies and tumults, nothing appeared but reſpect and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; That I was ſo farr from fearing them that they feared me, and the conſiderable ſervices I had rendered them had ſo highly recommended me, that my power was eſtabliſhed upon the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal affection and eſteem. That my authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was queſtioned by none, and that nothing was diſputed in <hi>Naples,</hi> neither were there any Conteſtations amongſt the people, but who ſhould teſtifie moſt reſpect to my perſon, and greateſt ſubmiſſion to my Orders. That the rabble had forgot their outrages and plunderings, and the better ſort acknowledged themſelves indebted to me, for preſervation of their fortunes, and the honor of their families, and had a greater zeal, reſpect, and affection for me than the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zares</hi> themſelves; and for the Nobility he had
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57207:179"/>
not perhaps penetrated to the bottom of their thoughts, nor diſcovered what was in their hearts, and that I well perceived he was ignorant of my intrigues, ſecret negotiations, and the meaſures I had taken with them; That they could not much longer keep <hi>Averſa,</hi> whoſe loſs would be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the disbanding of their Troops, and then the greateſt part of thoſe Gentlemen would go to their houſes, which would very much alarm the diſtruſtful humour of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> After all this I left him to judge by my whole diſcourſe whether I ought to hope or fear; That for a Throne I had never aſpired to it, and for a Scaffold I was ſecure enough from it, and in a condition to make whomſoever I pleaſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend it.</p>
            <p>He ſeemed much ſurpriſed at what I had told him, and returning to his firſt ſubject asked how I would diſpoſe of him? Keep you ſafe, ſaid I, and entertain you with all civility imaginable. But in what, replied he, can a man of fourſcore years old be uſeful to you? Conſidering the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity you are in, a ranſom would be of more advantage, of which if you will treat, you ſhall be punctually paid in <hi>Genoua</hi> the ſumm we ſhall agree on. None can be high enough, ſaid I, to get out of my hands a perſon of your Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and I can make ſo great advantages by you, that what neceſſity ſoever I have for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it is to no purpoſe to propoſe it, ſince I leſs value a Million than the having you in my power. He conjured me at leaſt to take Compaſſion of the youth of his grand-child, the ſole hope of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57207:179"/>
his Family, and his only Heir. You are a man, ſaid I, of a <hi>Romane</hi> Conſtancy, I can diſcover no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing weak about you but in this particular, of which I muſt make uſe, and he being ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ſacred a pledge, I will not part with him, ſince your years conſidered, you may ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly die, and then your impriſonment will be uſeleſs to me. He beſought me to let them both go on their Parole, which I was very farr from conſenting to, their preſence being neceſſary to me for many reaſons, particularly on conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that I expected my brother the Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> who, ſhould he unfortunately light into the hands of the enemie in his paſſage, I ſhould be very glad to have an exchange ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem him. What means is there then, ſaid he, ſighing and with tears in his eyes, to get Liberty for my ſelf and grandchild? There is but one, ſaid I, which I will not adviſe you to, nor durſt propound to you, if there were not an example for it in your own family, and that of one of the greateſt men of his time; That you do as did <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Doria,</hi> who in the ſight of <hi>Naples,</hi> left the ſervice of <hi>France,</hi> with all his Gallies, and turned to <hi>Spain,</hi> do you the ſame; he thought himſelf neglected, of which you may with greater reaſon complain, who have been ſo ſlightly expoſed for the intereſts of their Crown. Ah! he cried out, you know me not, I will ſuffer a thouſand deaths rather than be guilty of ſuch a weakneſs, and though I moſt tenderly love my Grand-child, I would with my own hand cut his throat, did I believe him capable of ſuch a thought, and I at
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57207:180"/>
this inſtant lay my curſe upon him, if in his whole life, for what cauſe ſoever, he ſeparate himſelf from the ſervice of the King my Maſter. You compelled me, ſaid I, to give you this affliction, but I freely tell you, there can be no other price of the liberty of two perſons ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>Upon this I ſtood up, and ſuppoſing he might have need of reſt, would have left my appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, which he would not accept, how much ſoever I preſſed him to it; but he beſought me that he might lodge in ſome other Cloyſter, where he might be more in repoſe, and free from the diſturbance of the People and Souldiers that had continual recourſe to me. I ſent preſently to have the Generals lodgings made ready for him in the Covent of Saint <hi>Laurence,</hi> and ſending for a Coach he was very glad to retire. I ſent him Linen by two of my Chamberlains, with order to ſtay and attend him; I drew out fifteen of my Guards with an Officer to ſecure him, and commanded a <hi>Polonian</hi> Gentleman that belonged to me, and ſpoke very good <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> to continue near him, and having a continual eye over his actions, prevent his having communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with any, and to ſuffer none to ſpeak with him without my Order. The Officer of my Guard was punctually to obſerve all ſuch Orders as the <hi>Polonian</hi> Gentleman ſhould give him in my name. For <hi>Don Proſpero Suardo</hi> I ſent him to the Vicai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to be ſhut up and treated as the other Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, becauſe that very night he attempted to negotiate with ſome perſons he met. The Duke
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57207:180"/>
of <hi>Turſi</hi> would by no means ſuffer his Grand-child to be ſeparated from him, and therefore cauſed him to lie in his own Chamber, though I had ordered another to be prepared for him. My Officers immediately carried them a Supper, but the good old Mans heart was ſo oppreſſed, that he eat nothing but a little fruit and a few ſweet-meats, and drank a Glaſs of water cooled with ice: Neither would he pull off his Clothes to go into the Bed, but caſting himſelf upon it paſſed the night without ſleep in great diſquiet.</p>
            <p>In the Morning I ſent to viſit him, and enquire of his health by the Knight <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> and to know if he would hear Maſs, if ſo, to accompany him, and tell him that if he would take the air in the afternoon, I would bring my Coach and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to divert the diſpleaſure of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After this Complement he preſented him from me twelve Baſons of fruits and preſerves, ſome fowl, a wild Boar and other Veniſon that had been ſent me out of the Country; I alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to be told, that if he deſired to cauſe any of his ſervants to come and attend him, he might do it, and write about his particular affairs; and becauſe he was my Priſoner, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into his poſſeſſion all ſuch revenues as he had in the Kingdom, which I had cauſed to be ſequeſtred, whileſt he was in Arms againſt me. He writ ſome Letters to <hi>Genoua</hi> to his Relations, and one to his Steward to ſend him a Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain and a Cook, which I ſent away as ſoon as I had peruſed them. He went to Maſs, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from whence, ſeeing a great many people
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57207:181"/>
gathered together, he began to make them an exhortation of the fidelity they owed to <hi>Spain,</hi> but was quickly interrupted by thoſe that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him on my behalf, who immediately brought him back into his apartment, and ſent me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of what had paſſed. As I went to viſit him after Dinner, ſome of the people (very much ſcandalized at his proceeding,) asking to what end I went to him, he not meriting that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, nor to give me ſo much pains, I ſent the Knight <hi>De Fourbin</hi> to tell him that by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet zeal, he had deprived me of the liberty of waiting on him, and ſince he abuſed that which I had with ſo great civility allowed him, if he were not afterwards more diſcreet, he would force me to put an end to it, and cauſe him to be ſhut up. And indeed ſuch as loved me not, and ſought occaſions to do me hurt, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſpred about the Town, that his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was an artifice of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to give me an opportunity of negotiating with them without diſtruſt: for this cauſe I never ſaw him any more all the time he remained my Priſoner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gennaro</hi> and <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> ſeeking nothing more than to cauſe diſturbances raiſed a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on occaſion of the rumors, which, as I have ſaid, were ſpred abroad, and of which they were the authors. A great many people gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to go to Saint <hi>Lawrences</hi> Convent, and cut off the Duke of <hi>Turſi</hi>'s head: I made haſte, and my preſence quickly diſperſed them: being returned to the <hi>Carmelites, Gennaro</hi> came to make me a moſt honorable Propoſition, that to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57207:181"/>
ſatisfie the people in their jealouſie of the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of the Duke of <hi>Turſi,</hi> which he thought was by conſent, I ſhould ſacrifice him to that diſtruſt, and with him the Prince of <hi>Avella</hi> and <hi>Dom Proſpero Suardo,</hi> cauſing their heads to be publickly cut off in the Market-place, That ſuch a Spectacle would be more agreeable to him, and give him greater joy, then the return of the French Fleet, and landing all ſuccors they ſtood in need of. I was ſurpriſed at his brutality, and anſwered him, that did not his ignorance excuſe him, I would cauſe him to be puniſhed for daring to propoſe to me ſo infamous an action; That if hereafter he were not more diſcreet, than to mention ſuch a thing to me, I would not pardon him, but make him underſtand that I loved not to ſhed innocent bloud, but onely that of perſons convicted of crimes; that this indeed might have become him or <hi>Mazaniello,</hi> who acted onely as beaſts, without juſtice, reaſon or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Next Morning I ſent the Knight <hi>de Fourbin</hi> to Complement my Priſoner, and enquire of his health, with Order, if he would comport himſelf more prudently than the day before, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him to Maſs: He promiſed it, but not able to forbear preaching to the people, I no more ſuffered him to go abroad; and in the afternoon cauſed him to be removed to the Palace of the Marquis of <hi>Terracuſe,</hi> which I had ordered to be very handſomly furniſhed. The Prince of <hi>Avella</hi> naturally of a better temper than his Grandfather, made many inſtances to him of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57207:182"/>
the indiſcretion of his zeal, by which they loſt the Liberty I had granted them. The Duke of <hi>Turſi</hi> ſent to demand my permiſſion for his Steward to come to him that he might ſend him to <hi>Genoua,</hi> for which I gave him a Paſs, as alſo for the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Lands, with whom he was to regulate domeſtick affairs, provided he ſpoke not to them but aloud, and in preſence of the Knight <hi>de Fourbin</hi> and his Keeper. He ſent me word that the Marquis of <hi>Vaſto</hi> his Nephew had given him a pied Courſer, the beautifulleſt of the whole Kingdom, which was at one of his Houſes, which I ſent for and cauſed to be brought him, ſuppoſing he intended to preſent him to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> but he ſent him to me, and deſired me to keep him for his ſake; I accepted him kindly, though to ſay the truth, he gave me but what was mine own, for before my Order to fetch him, he had been taken by ſome of my Officers that had ſent him to me.</p>
            <p>The ſixth of <hi>January</hi> in the Morning came one of the enemies Trumpets, with the Baron of <hi>Batteville</hi>'s Paſs, to deſire that I would permit <hi>Don Pedro de la Molta Sarmiento,</hi> chief Steward of <hi>Don John</hi> to come and viſit the Duke of <hi>Turſi</hi> and Prince of <hi>Avella</hi> in his Maſters name, who had as great kindneſs for the Grandchild as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the Grandfather, that had been aſſigned him by <hi>Spain</hi> for a Councellour and Inſtructor, as a perſon in whom they much confided, and of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great experience. I gave all Orders neceſſary for his reception, and to have him brought to me, being very careful to make it appear to him, that
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57207:182"/>
we wanted nothing, but on the contrary had very great abundance. He gave me thanks in his Maſters name for the good uſage of my Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which he beſought me to continue, which would lay an Obligation on him in particular, their perſons being very dear to him. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made me many Complements on his own part, and told me he had received many Civilities at <hi>Bayonne</hi> from my deceaſed father, (whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant he was ever after) at the time when he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the Duke of <hi>Vzede,</hi> at the mariages of the Queen mother and late Queen of <hi>Spain.</hi> He deſired leave to acquit himſelf of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which I gave him, conditionally that he ſhould return to me before he went away. I cauſed him to be accompanied by the Knight <hi>de Fourbin Onofrio Piſacani,</hi> and two other of greateſt Reputation amongſt the people, to be witneſſes of the Converſation of this viſit, which paſſed publickly, onely in condolings of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and offers of all manner of Services. When he came back to me, I mentioned to him the good Condition we were in, of which he was a witneſs, and of which I deſired him to make a true Relation. I aſſured him that I had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the ſpeedy return of our Fleet, which would perform its dutie better than formerly, having very preciſe Orders, letting him alſo know that I was not ignorant of the neceſſities they on their ſide ſuffered. I told him that did I not doubt his Maſter would impute it rather to Vanity than Civility, I would ſend him every day ice, fruits, all manner of herbs, wild fowl, ſweet-meats,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57207:183"/>
new bread, excellent wines, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other delicacies. He went away very well ſatisfied with the Civilities he received from me, which, as I was told, at his return he highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it being neceſſary to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all mens ſpirits, dejected by the Fleets abandoning us, and ſo ſtrange a deprival of all expected ſuccours, I applied my ſelf to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very extraordinary, and contrived wayes of bringing Proviſions to the Town, the want whereof grew ſo great, that every Morning cries were heard in ſeveral parts, <hi>Bread</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi> But my preſence prevented theſe diſcontents from ariſing to a Tumult, the people after I had ſpoken to them ſtill crying out, that having ſeen me they thought no more of Bread.</p>
            <p>By the Correſpondencies I held in <hi>Averſa,</hi> I underſtood there was a diviſion amongſt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, of whom the greateſt part thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring, weary of carrying on a war at their own charge, and ſo exhauſted of Money, that for want of Pay they could no longer keep their Troops together, nor prevent their disbanding. There happened alſo a great quarrel between the Earl of <hi>Converſano</hi> and <hi>Don Vincenzo Tutta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> Commander of the body of the Nobility, which went ſo farre that every one ſided, and in fine, reſolved no longer to obey him; the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were therefore forced to take his charge from him, and leave the choice of another Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to the Nobility, which yet was not made till ſome time after. I made an advantageous
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57207:183"/>
uſe of theſe diſorders, and to give a pretence for abandoning <hi>Averſa,</hi> to ſuch as deſired to retire, I ordered the Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> to ſend five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Muſquetteers to poſſeſs <hi>Luſciano,</hi> and three hundred to <hi>Marchianiſa,</hi> to ſhut them up more cloſely, and by a Poſt I took near <hi>Voltorno,</hi> cut off their Communication with <hi>Capua.</hi> I ſent alſo a hundred Muſquetteers to take in the Tower of <hi>Patria,</hi> a place famous for the retirement of <hi>Scipio</hi> in the time of his misfortune, commanding them to intrench themſelves ſo very well in thoſe three Poſts that they might keep them. The March of theſe Troops gave ſo great apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Nobility that were aſſembled in <hi>Averſa,</hi> that after a long Conſultation they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to quit it, and retreat to <hi>Capua.</hi> This was a mortal, blow to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> becauſe I became Maſter of a Town full of Corn, deprived them of the ways of getting any by Land, obliged almoſt all the Nobility to retire to their houſes, and freed my ſelf of a body of an army, the onely one that kept the field for them. I drew alſo great advantages from the jealouſie this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion gave the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of all the Nobility, not attributing it ſo much to neceſſity, as to ſecret Negotiations and Correſpondencies they thought I had managed. This opinion of theirs being very uſeful to me, I endeavoured to confirm it by all manner of Probabilities.</p>
            <p>This Miracle wrought by Heaven in my favour, ſo neceſſary to encourage the people, and comfort them after the going away of the Fleet, happened on <hi>Twelfe Eve.</hi> I received the news about ten
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57207:184"/>
in the forenoon with extraordinary joy, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral applauſes of the whole City; it was height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by circumſtances not a little ſatisfactory to me, becauſe the march of my Troops gave ſo great terror to the body of an Army, I held, as it were, beſieged, though very much ſtronger than we, that it abandoned the place at day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, in ſo great diſorder that it left behind nineteen foot Colors, and ſome Cornets, of which I made uſe with great modeſtie, making no triumph in <hi>Naples,</hi> nor carrying them thither, not ſo much becauſe they had been taken without a fight, as in regard they were Troops particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging to the Nobility, to whom I ſought to be favourable in all things, to oblige them by this moderation, (ſince to have done otherwiſe would not have been to much purpoſe,) and free them of part of their ſhame and reſentment; That which ſeems to me moſt remarkable, and will appear very extraordinary, is, that in the ſpace of twenty days I made my ſelf Maſter of a great Town, ſupplied <hi>Naples</hi> with Victual, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed an Army of near four thouſand horſe, and almoſt the ſame number of foot, encloſed in a Town which I could only block at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, having my ſelf but four thouſand foot, of which fifteen hundred were without arms, and five or ſix hundred very bad horſe, with four pieces of Canon, and only four hundred pound of Powder: In which condition yet I ſtruck a terrour in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and reduced them almoſt to utter ruine.</p>
            <p>I preſently ſent Orders to the Baron of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene</hi>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:57207:184"/>
to cauſe Proclamation to be made, that on pain of death none ſhould plunder any houſe in <hi>Averſa,</hi> whoſe inhabitants had ſo willingly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Gates to us, and inſtantly gave us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the enemies retreat; to cauſe account to be taken of the Corn, and ſo good order to be held, that at my coming thither on the ſeventh of <hi>January</hi> in the Morning there might be no complaint. I could not go the ſixth, becauſe of the arrival of <hi>Don Pedro Sarmiento,</hi> whom I could not delay, becauſe I had ſent him a Paſs, and was deſirous to be preſent for preventing any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, or the holding any Conference with him.</p>
            <p>I imparted this good news to Cardinal <hi>Filo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marini,</hi> that he might in the afternoon ſing <hi>Te Deum</hi> in the great Church, and our joy was publiſhed through all the Town by ringing of Bells, the little Powder we had not allowing it to be done with Canon, Vollies or Fire-works. The late dignity I had acquired obliging me to ſomething more of State, I took horſe to ride to the great Church, attended by my Guards and ſome Gentlemen that applied themſelves to me, by all <hi>Frenchmen</hi> that belonged to me, all Officers of the Army, and City Captains, with other of the moſt conſiderable Citizens, my Company of Switzers going before, which though it ought to have been a hundred could as yet be made but fifty, this being the firſt time it marched. <hi>Te Deum</hi> ended I rid about the Town to ſhew my ſelf to the people, and aſſure them that ere four days were paſſed they ſhould ſee abundance
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57207:185"/>
of, Corn in their City, and enjoy the effects of my Negotiations and Addreſs. That we ſhould ſhortly receive very powerful ſuccors; but that, in caſe of delay, I would put them in a condition to attend them with patience, and reduce the enemy to greater neceſſity than we were ever in; that we could now juſtly ſtyle our ſelves Maſters of the Field, ſince there was no army that durſt appear before us. My diſcourſes were hearkned to with very great ſatisfaction; The confidence and affection for me was in ſuch a manner aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that it had been very unſafe for any to have diſputed my authority, I paſſed the reſt of the day in viſiting all the Poſts, and the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſending diſpatches through the whole Kingdom, that I might take advantage of the zeal this good news generally incited:</p>
            <p>On <hi>Twelf day</hi> I was advertiſed that day Troops committed diſorders on <hi>Averſa,</hi> and Complaints being, made me I promiſed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to go thither the next Morning, to cauſe reſtauration of whatſoever had been taken away; and give Exemplary puniſhment to thoſe that had diſobeyed my Proclamation, that none for the future might dare the like inſolence. I took horſe early, and came to <hi>Averſa</hi> about ten a Clock; The Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> with the greateſt part of the Officers met me; He was very much ſurpriſed that I appeared ſomewhat cool at his arrival; and told me it ſeemed I had but little Joy at the good ſucceſs of <hi>Averſa;</hi> which ſecured me from the danger to which the departure of the Fleet expoſed me, and put my affairs in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57207:185"/>
poſture, gaining me honour, and cauſe to hope well. I anſwered, that being to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe no body, owing ſo happy an event to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune alone, my joy was but moderate, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by my ſorrow for my Souldiers diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that in contempt of my Proclamation, had plundered thoſe that ſo kindly received them into their Town, and the negligence of my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers that neither prevented nor puniſhed it. He replied, that no cauſe had been given for complaints, and that he knew not any that had not exactly contained themſelves within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of their duty. I am not pleaſed, ſaid I, to hear Guilty perſons excuſed, when their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is neceſſary to the eſtabliſhing my honour and authority, I ſhall very well diſcover the truth of all, and owing juſtice to thoſe that ſeek it of me, will cauſe my ſelf to be beloved by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Town, and feared by the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>And the Examples I will make before I go from hence, ſhall cauſe my Orders to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after exactly obſerved by all my Troops. After this I entered the Town very much diſcontented, and went to the great Church to hear Maſs. The Clergy received me at the Gate with the uſual honours, and afterwards ſang <hi>Te Deum.</hi> At my coming out of the Church, a Prieſt caſt himſelf at my feet, to demand Juſtice for plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Linen of the Hoſpital of the <hi>Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciati.</hi> I ordered him to name thoſe that were guilty of it without any fear, which having done I ſent preſently to ſecure them, and cauſing their houſe to be ſearched the Linen was found, which
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57207:186"/>
I made immediately be reſtored. After this a woman all in tears preſented her ſelf; crying out, She was undone, and all that ſhe had taken from her; I aſſured her that if ſhe knew the thieves, they ſhould be immediately puniſhed. She pointed to one that by chance ſtood very near me, whom catching by the Belt I diſarmed, and put into the hands of my Guards, to carry him to priſon. The Canons oppoſed, telling me the Church ought to be a Sanctuary; I anſwered, not for ſuch actions, that if I ſuffered the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Souldiers, and my Orders to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed without puniſhment, I could ſecure no houſe, nor the Churches themſelves; that they ought therefore to reſerve their Interceſſions and Priviledges for worthier occaſions, where pardon might not draw on ſo dangerous conſequences. From thence I went through the whole Town to view it, and as I received Complaints, ſent the Souldiers to priſon. Coming to the Biſhops Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace where Dinner was provided for me, I ſent for <hi>Bernardo Spirito</hi> the Auditor General, and commanded him to have Gallowſes ſet up in the principal Streets of the Town, and one before the Gate of the Hoſpital of the <hi>Annunciata,</hi> and cauſing five Souldiers that were Priſoners to be confeſſed, ſee them inſtantly hanged for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, no more formality being neceſſary, ſince the Proclamation they had heard condemned them. The Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> carrying part of my Company to dine with him, I bid him take care that execution were done before I took horſe to return. Many of the Town came to ſee me
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57207:186"/>
dine, whom I careſſed all I poſſibly could, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Gentry, of which there are many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and of the moſt ancient of the Kingdom, who, according to the cuſtom of <hi>Italy,</hi> dwell in Cities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After Dinner I cauſed an account to be brought me of what Corn was found in the Town, with the names of the Proprietors, and the Rates they would ſell it at, of which having agreed, I forbid the carrying any of it to any other part but <hi>Naples,</hi> and the ſelling it to any but my ſelf, promiſing punctual payment: and for that which the enemies had amaſſed to make their Troops ſubſiſt, ſending for Mules and Horſes to the Neighbouring Villages, I appointed three hundered to be laden and ſent me the next day to <hi>Naples.</hi> Having regulated all as I ought I called for my Horſes to return, and going down met on the Stairs the Baron of <hi>Modene,</hi> who came from Dinner followed by a great many Officers, I asked if execution had been made according to my Orders; He anſwered, he knew not, and that he could not willingly cauſe poor Souldiers to be hanged on ſo ſlight occaſions, ſuppoſing it inconvenient to diſpleaſe them, our preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity conſidered; to which I briskly replyed, that he ſhould have done better to have obeyed me, than by ſo great indulgence for them, have left their diſorders unpuniſhed, I regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating my ſelf by particular Maximes, on which he had not reflected as I had done. He ſaid he would obey me in all things, only in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought me to diſpenſe with him, for he could not find in his heart to puniſh thoſe wretches for ſo
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57207:187"/>
ſmall a matter; Reſolved to ſatisfie the people, and diſliking replies, it belongs not to you, ſaid I, to judge whether I have reaſon or no, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conteſtation to do what I command you, of which if you fail I know very well how to make my ſelf obeyed, and teach you what belongs to the duties of the charge. He went away ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what concerned with the rigor wherewithal I treated him, yet without complaint or murmure. The whole Town of <hi>Averſa</hi> gave me a thouſand Benedictions for this ſevere juſtice, was intirely ſatisfied, and loſt all apprehenſion of injury from my men for the future.</p>
            <p>Sending afterwards for the Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> I ſignified my regret to have uſed him ſo roughly in publick, but that he had forced me to it, by a too light confidence in the kindneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I had ever teſtified for him; that I ſhould have hearkened to his remonſtrances had he made them in private, but that our Souldiers might take advantage by his diſcourſe, perhaps ſo as to become more licentious. That a Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter General was to ſuppreſs not authoriſe their exceſſes, which he in ſome manner ſeemed to do. That pardons were alwayes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the General, and not from any that was ſubordinate. And that another time he ought to be more conſiderate, becauſe being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſomewhat cholerick, I might be in an humour not to paſs matters by ſo eaſily; and that it belonged to him to give example to all others of acquieſcence in my Orders. That he well knew the confidence I ever had in him, and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57207:187"/>
the particular affection I had on all occaſions made appear. That he ſhould govern himſelf with greater Caution, and not compel me, do what I could to the contrary, to undo him. I commanded him to be very careful to prevent any diſorder in <hi>Averſa,</hi> and to innovate nothing without my participation, to cauſe the Corn very carefully to be preſerved, and none of it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported without my Orders, which he might twice a day receive, as well as in four and twenty hours my returns to all intelligence he ſhould give me: that in the Morning at day break he ſhould ſend away the three hundred Mules laden with Corn, after which embracing him, and the reſt of the Officers of the Army, and chief of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants I took horſe for <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time being good natured he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gave too great credit to perſons ill affected towards me, who ſought to exaſperate, and taking advantage by his diſcontent, to ſeparate him from my intereſts. They inſenſibly engaged him to actions that ruined him, the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of my humour conſidered, what care ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I took to preſerve him to me, of which his evil fortune ſuffered him not to make advantage. He had a Secretary called <hi>Pepe Caetano</hi> capable of all manner of Knaveries; A Colonel called <hi>Antonio Calco,</hi> a good Souldier, but who having learned his Profeſſion amongſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had ſtill a kindneſs for them, and ſome intention to do them ſervice; a Colonel of Dragoons called <hi>Marco Piſano,</hi> who could not overcome the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to punderings and inſolence, to which
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57207:188"/>
he had been accuſtomed the long time he was a <hi>Bandito; Andrea Rama,</hi> a Captain of Horſe; who continued ſtill the humors of a catchpole which he had been in <hi>Naples</hi> before the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And the Cavalier <hi>Michellini</hi> his adjutant, a perſon of wit and intrigue, that continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned my deſtruction, by it to give advantage to Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> in his Pretenſes to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> having ſecret and particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to him. The poor Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> placing all his confidence in thoſe dangerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſtudying onely to make himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by careſſing the Souldiers, and feaſting the Officers, found himſelf precipitate ere he was aware, by being too eaſily ſwayed by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and giving them ſuch liberty that many things were done in his name, not only prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to me, but to the whole party, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me to puniſh them, without any poſſibility of preventing his being involved in their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, though in effect he was not culpable. It is eaſily imagined in what manner I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Naples,</hi> by reaſon of the advantage the taking of <hi>Averſa</hi> brought us, and the great ſuccors we might draw from thence, having found there above thirty thouſand charges of Corn.</p>
            <p>The eighth of <hi>January</hi> the three hundred Mules laden with Corn arrived, which cauſed an exceſſive joy in <hi>Naples,</hi> where no more remained then four or five days Proviſion. I met this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy and led it into the Town my ſelf: And coming from <hi>Cappo de Chino,</hi> as farre as which I
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57207:188"/>
was advanced, a thing very extraordinary happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which was ſeen by three thouſand perſons with me. At four in the afternoon a Star appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my left hand, as great as one of the moſt prodigious Comets, and ſeemed no higher ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated than they are uſually, it ſtood a quarter of an hour without motion, and then falling with extraordinary ſwiftneſs, and traverſing towards my right hand, ſtopped in the middle of the way juſt over my horſes head, and then ſeparating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three great flames, rejoyned about thirty foot from ground, and falling vaniſhed. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie was the ſubject of much diſcourſe, but very few explained what it might ſignifie. I with much diſpleaſure underſtood that the Baron of <hi>Modene,</hi> by advice of the perſons already named, and a too paſſionate zeal, had turned out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa,</hi> five and thirty Families, ſuſpected to hold correſpondence with the enemy, the greateſt part of them of the Gentry (and this by impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the people to whom he thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give ſatisfaction) and withal ſequeſtred their Eſtates. I had compaſſion on their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, they caſting themſelves at my feet, and ordered their re-admiſſion, which I gave them in writing, ſigned by my hand; forbidding the Baron of <hi>Modene,</hi> under pain of my diſpleaſure, to do any more the like without my participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and particular order, commanding him to ſend the heads of their accuſation, with the informers, that I might take time for examination of this buſineſs, which ſeemed of high concernment. They returned very well ſatisfied with me, and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57207:189"/>
eſpecially with an order I added to all ſuch as had in their hands any thing of theirs, to return it within four and twenty hours, on pain of their lives; and told them that upon notice of the leaſt delay, I would go my ſelf to ſee juſtice done them, and give exemplary puniſhment. The ſame Marchioneſs of <hi>Attaviana,</hi> of whom I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken, ſent to complain to me, that her houſe had been plundered, with the particulars of what had been taken away: I gave in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half the ſame Orders, and under the ſame penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that ſhe might be righted. But neither ſhe nor the Exiles found the diſpatch I deſired, and being impatient of delay (the Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> acting ſlackly in it, by reaſon of his intereſt in his Officers exactions, who being powerful in our Troops, he thought he ought not to diſpleaſe them) I writ him a thundering letter, by which I let him underſtand, that if my Orders were not obeyed that very day, I would ſend <hi>Aniello Porcio</hi> whom I had made Auditor General in place of <hi>Bernardo Spirito</hi> (whom I neither found vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nor reſolute enough) to undertake this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and give me information of all that had paſſed; and that two days after I would go in perſon, to make examples of ſuch as ſhould be convicted, without exemption or conſideration of any. That which had been omitted on my firſt Order, was now immediately performed out of apprehenſion and reſpect of my humour natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imperious and impatient of neglect of my Commands. And as I had little ſatisfaction in their manner of proceeding, I ſuppoſe they had

not much in mine, and that they could hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear murmuring in private, becauſe they obeyed me without pretending to juſtifie themſelves, or alledging Reaſons.</p>
            <p>A little after this, I gave the Government of <hi>Nola</hi> to <hi>Sieur Antonio Tonti</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> near which place there happened a Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh between the Nobility and ſome of our Troops, which I had cauſed to be ſtrengthened with the <hi>militia's</hi> of the neighbouring Towns, where <hi>Don Ferrante Caraciolo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Caſtello de Sangre,</hi> a Perſon of great power and highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt the People, whom he ever treated with much rigour, was ſlain, with a ſon of the Earl of <hi>Converſano,</hi> and another of the Prince of <hi>Ottaino</hi> of the Family of <hi>Medici,</hi> which cauſed their men to retreat and afterwards disband. In five or ſix days time we received from <hi>Averſa</hi> above a thouſand Load of Wheat, which as much aſtoniſhed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as the ill news that came to them from all parts; They no longer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any Proviſions from the Countrey, and a Tempeſt ſome days hindering the Navigation of their Gallies, caſting away one with three ſmaller Veſſels laden with Proviſions, had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to what would ſupply them onely four and twenty hours. They looked on themſelves as loſt, when a Gally laden with Meal arriving as by miracle, freed them from this Extremity, to which they were afterwards twice reduced. Theſe good ſucceſſes much rejoyced the people, and gave them hope of a ſpeedy liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gennaro</hi> that loſt no occaſion of endeavouring

my ruine, having notice of all that had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and the Baron of <hi>Modene,</hi> and that he was very ſenſibly concerned, hoping to make ſome advantage by his diſcontent, ſent a Prieſt called <hi>Don Carmine Castelli,</hi> in whom he had an intire confidence, to offer him his ſervice, and propoſe to him, that if he would engage with him, he ſhould under him command all the Forces of the Kingdom, being reſolved to ſend me into <hi>France,</hi> and again take the authority upon himſelf, which he could eaſily do at the return of the Fleet, if he could but be aſſured of our Troops, having in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it a very good underſtanding with the Kings Miniſters that were at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> would not hear of this, but anſwered, that when he knew I was no longer ſatisfied in his comportment, he would go home, and give me advice of it by <hi>Pepe Caetano</hi> his Secretary. <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi> finding he could not engage him in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, endeavoured to give me a jealouſie of him, with falſe information that they were agreed, and held ſecret conferences; which was malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſeconded by <hi>Auguſtino Lieto,</hi> who thought, the other being removed from me, he ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards enjoy a greater ſhare in my truſt; Not diſcovering this contrivance, I had ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of him, which <hi>Aniello Porcio,</hi> Auditor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, endeavoured all that he could to fortifie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it his buſineſs to give me jealouſie of all <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> being himſelf a creature and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of <hi>Spain,</hi> as he publiſhed after my impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for which he was well rewarded.</p>
            <p>A great deal of Corn came every day from
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57207:190"/>
               <hi>Averſa,</hi> and thinking it neceſſary to ſupply the charge of the peoples Elect, long vacant by <hi>Cicio</hi> of <hi>Arpaia</hi>'s abſenting himſelf, choice was made of <hi>Antonio Macella,</hi> an underſtanding and rich man, born in <hi>Procita,</hi> who joyning with <hi>Vincenzo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea</hi> and <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and holding ſecret Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the enemy, gave me encumbrances I had much ado to overcome, as in its time I ſhall make appear. After this I cauſed Papers to be ſcattered amongſt the enemies, in order to debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their men, promiſing a Piſtol to every Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that forſook them, employment to ſuch as would ſerve, and Paſſes to thoſe that were willing to retire. Two hundered came to us in eight days time. They made report of the extremity of their ſufferings, and ſhew'd me a piece of their Bread, very black, and full of Sand, and indeed ſo bad that I could not imagine how it ſuſtained them, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but nine or ten ounces a day. Amongſt this number of deſertors a matter of ſixſcore deſired to ſerve me, which I diſtributed amongſt the body to keep them aſunder, except ſixty <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi> which I put into the Colonels Company of my Regiment, till I might get a number ſufficient to form a body. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were very much concerned to hear on our Poſts in the night their Language ſpoken, and invitations to run away, by repreſenting the neceſſity they ſuffered, and the abundance that was amongſt us. That which I thought moſt pleaſant, was that they which were with us called the other the Rebels of the people of <hi>Naples.</hi> Their moſt prodigious ſufferings were every day more and more confirmed, by our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57207:191"/>
ſometimes ſix or ſeven of thoſe wretches, who having loſt the ſhape of men, went out of their Quarters to eat Graſs like beaſts, of which ſome burſt, when (having come to us) they had filled their bellies. This disbanding more and more increaſed, and ſo farr that apprehending they might be met with as they went away, and ſtopped to ſtrengthen the Garriſon of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> and ſome others of the Kingdom, I ſhut up in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairy all thoſe that would not take entertainment with us; There was amongſt them a <hi>Portugeſe</hi> of ill meen but good wit, who by my Order going over to the enemy never came back without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching five or ſix of his Companions, and one time brought me ſeventeen; in this he had ſucceſs nine or ten Voyages, but being at laſt diſcovered, by imprudently opening himſelf to a Serjeant, he was hanged, which broke off this little commerce, and for a while prevented the deſertion of their Souldiers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> now gave themſelves for loſt, and reſolved to abandon the Caſtles, and retire to <hi>Gaeta,</hi> and the other Forts of the Kingdom, in expectation of ſuccors from <hi>Spain,</hi> and Proviſions from <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Sicilia,</hi> from whence came three Veſſels laden with Corn ſo opportunely, that at that time they had not wherewithal to ſubſiſt above three or four days. This great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity put them upon all contrivances to oblige me to go out of <hi>Naples,</hi> believing my preſence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to be the cauſe of all their ſufferings, and that my addreſs, vigilance, and ſecret negotiations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to this unhappy condition. An acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:57207:191"/>
of which I made the beſt advantage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled their jealouſie of the Nobility. The Duke of <hi>Andria</hi> having been with <hi>Don John</hi> and the Vice-Roy, to get leave to go home, ſent a Prieſt, in whom he had confidence, to fetch him two thouſand Crowns he had left in <hi>Naples</hi> with one of his friends, and ſome Stuffs to make him Clothes. As he returned with all theſe things he was taken and brought to me, as alſo ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters found about him. After many enquiries of his Maſters health, I ordered him to make him many Complements in my name, and cauſed the Money and Stuffs to be found out and reſtored without loſs of any thing, telling him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a great many, purpoſely that it might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come publick, that I would my ſelf correſpond with his Maſter, and all Perſons of Quality that had affairs in the Town, or any thing to pretend there, and that no man ſhould better nor more readily acquit himſelf of all their Commiſſions, deſiring nothing ſo much as to ſerve them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my ſelf more in their intereſts than in my own particular. I gave him two of my Guards for his convoy, and cauſed him to paſs in ſight of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to whom this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding gave ſtrange ſuſpitions, ſuppoſing it to be the conſequence of a particular friendſhip I had made with him at our Conference. He pretended himſelf much obliged to me, but ſtayed but little with the Vice-Roy, who was in a mind to have ſecured him; which yet he durſt not do, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that by means of the intereſt his Birth and Merit gave him amongſt the Nobility, his
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:57207:192"/>
impriſonment would be followed by a general Declaration in my favour: but this became ſo fixed in the thoughts of that revengeful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful Nation, that on doubt of ſome corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with me at my laſt journey, a few days after my return, they cauſed him to be miſerably ſlain.</p>
            <p>One Morning, <hi>Don Carlo Gonzago,</hi> who kept very near me to get an employment, demanded if he might ſpeak freely to me; which having promiſed, he told me, that a very honeſt man, a friend of his, intruſted with Credentials not to be diſowned, had deſired him to come and found me, whether I would hear a propoſal in behalf of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> on condition nevertheleſs that if I liked it not, I ſhould not enquire his name; to this he cauſed me to make Oath, which I religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved. I was willing to hear him, that by the largeneſs of their offers I might judge of the extremity they were reduced to. They were to give me <hi>Finale</hi> and the other places of <hi>Toſcanie</hi> in Soveraignty; with the Principalities of <hi>Saler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, Piombino</hi> and <hi>Portolongone</hi>; for attacquing which they would ſupply me with ſufficient For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, beſides all ſuch as my intereſts could draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> if I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. That they would make what they offered me worth three hundred thouſand Crowns a year, for which I ſhould have ſufficient ſecurity; and when I ſhould be out of danger of expoſing my ſelf, I ſhould be umpire between them and the People; and knowing the Pretences I had by my Great Grand-mothers mother to the Dutchy
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57207:192"/>
of <hi>Modena,</hi> they would procure me to be put in poſſeſſion of it by the Emperour, who ſhould ſend an Army out of <hi>Germany</hi> to joyn with that of the Dutchie of <hi>Milan,</hi> and that to revenge themſelves of the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> they would abandon all affairs in other places, and give me the command of ſuch Forces, that I ſhould find very few rubs in my way, <hi>Italy</hi> having no cauſe to be jealous if I ſought to make good the right I had to that Sovereignty.</p>
            <p>I anſwered, ſmiling, that he had done me a pleaſure to make me underſtand by his diſcourſe, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſo near ruine, that I would proſecute them the more vigorouſly, and that though my own were infallible, I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall from my fidelity to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> nor attacque its Allies, and that I would moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerve the Oath I had made to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Naples,</hi> never till death to lay down the Arms I had taken up for their Liberty: that I was not offended with him for what he had undertaken, knowing that his friendſhip for me was the cauſe of it, and that being an enemy to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (as I had been informed) they having ever uſed him ill, and detained him ſo long time Priſoner, I was aſſured he had an averſion for this imployment, and that he was too much a man of Honour, to adviſe me to fail of my duty, and betray thoſe I was obliged to ſerve: That he ſhould give thanks to his friend in my name, and aſſure him I would never enquire after him.</p>
            <p>The Town the mean while was divided into ſix factions, which obliged me to be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57207:193"/>
ſcrupulous in my conduct, leſt, whil'ſt I inclin'd to one, the reſt might joyn with our enemies, which would have infallibly ruined me: but I had influence over all thoſe ſeparated intereſts, without diſcovering my own thoughts, and kept ſo good correſpondence with them all, that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to concur to the execution of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, which was not difficult. The firſt of theſe factions was that of <hi>Gennaro</hi> and the rabble, which ever ſince their hatred of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had been ſo habituated to the plundering of Houſes, and all manner of inſolencies, that they could not now forbear them. Theſe people were enraged againſt me, becauſe by my puniſhing ſuch actions, they were forced to obſerve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions I made: but they hoped for ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and revolution, little caring from whence it came, nor who had the advantage of it, provided they might rob and murther with impunity, being ſo accuſtomed to bloud, that they preferred the pleaſure of ſhedding it above all other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. They continued an irreconcileable hatred againſt the Nobility and civilized people, whom they feared, becauſe they had ſo often and highly affronted them, they could expect no pardon. I kept this ſort of people low, and was their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital enemy, believing that if I permitted diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, I could not ſubſiſt long, I yet indulged them by the care I had to ſupply them with all things neceſſary to life at eaſie rates.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was that which deſired to ſubmit to <hi>France,</hi> made up for the greateſt part of Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who hoping to make their fortunes by our
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57207:193"/>
Nation, and enrich themſelves by our expence in Clothes, and all ſuch other things with which we are wont to furniſh our ſelves more than other Nations, and pretending to no Offices nor Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, apprehended not ſubjection to foreign Dominion; deſiring that rather than any other, becauſe by it they expected more profit. I hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored all that were of it, ſeeming to have no other thought, nor to labour to any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but as I deſired to continue in their good opinion, I was alſo to be careful to keep ſecret that pretence, that I might not reunite all other parties to joyn with our enemies, which muſt firſt be driven away: after which it would be eaſie to attain our ends.</p>
            <p>The third was compoſed of Monks and Prieſts, and others of the devouter ſort, who deſired the reuniting the Crown of <hi>Naples</hi> to the Papacy; this I let them underſtand was my principal end; that I was of a Family highly Catholick, very much devoted to the Pope, with whom I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſecret Meaſures, and made ſo near a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction that he was well ſatisfied of my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; That they ought to concur with me to drive away the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and keep their thoughts very ſecret, leſt we might meet obſtacles, by the confederacy of thoſe which deſired the contrary, and I promiſed that as ſoon as we had overcome our enemies, we would ſubmit our ſelves to the authority of the Church.</p>
            <p>The fourth was more eaſily managed than the reſt; for deſirous of a King, and ſignifying that they had made choice of my perſon, they were
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57207:194"/>
ſenſible of the neceſſity of Secrecy, and the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they had for me, ſecuring them of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements, they were altogether guided by my Directions, and acted nothing but by my Orders. This Partie conſiſted of ſuch as aſpired to the honours and grandeurs of the Kingdom, every one according to his Quality, who reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never to become ſubject to a forein Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, deſired no money might go out of their Countrey, imagining this the only way to enrich themſelves, and re-eſtabliſh traffique, and that a King whom they had choſen, for his own intereſt and preſervation, would have no other Countrey but his Kingdom, nor any confidence, love, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination but for his Subjects.</p>
            <p>The fifth Faction was of thoſe that deſired a Republick, of whom the greateſt part under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not what they ſought, mightily taken with the word, which they ſcarce knew how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, imagining they ſhould be ſubject to no body, and that the meaneſt of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould have credit and power equal with the richeſt and beſt qualified: I perſwaded them that ſuch an eſtabliſhment was my prevailing paſſion, that I looked on ſuch a ſtructure with affection and delight, as the workmanſhip of my hands, ſince I had been the firſt propoſer of it; and that the Dignity of Duke, to which they had raiſed me, gave me the firſt place, the principal authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and all the Honours of a Sovereign. I moved them to conſider how much it concerned us to conceal this deſign, that we might not incite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us all that were contrary, and that as ſoon
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57207:194"/>
as ever the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were driven away, towards which we muſt with hazard of our lives uſe our utmoſt endeavour; This form of Government would in a manner eſtabliſh it ſelf, none being excluded, and every man in a poſſibility of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantages and ſecurity, and making his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by it, of what quality or profeſſion ſoever he might be. In this manner every one of the five factions took me to be of their partie, and changing like a Camelion, according as I ſpoke to one or the other of them, concealing my own thoughts, I diſcovered theirs, to get light, and take unerring meaſures.</p>
            <p>The laſt was of ſuch as were addicted to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> intereſts by reaſon of thoſe themſelves had on the Gabels, where lay the beſt part of their Eſtates; I gave them hopes of preſerving them in caſe of a ſubverſion of the Government; and minded them that a greater jealouſie being had of them than of others, they ought to be more careful of their conduct, ſince the leaſt of their motions would be made criminal: Theſe were obliged to me for preſerving their fortunes, and the honour of every one of their Families, whereof I aſſured them to take a particular care, provided they did nothing to deprive me of the means of protecting them. I commended their zeal and fidelity, and told them I affected and eſteemed them more than the reſt, becauſe they were perſons of more honour. Theſe were very ſollicitous for my ſafety, which they thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to their own, and their ruine being infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible on the leaſt revolution, being hated by the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57207:195"/>
common people, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having no jealouſie of them, they gave me notice of all conſpiracies againſt me, and all other enterpriſes, fearing my fall and their own with me, if the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs were dubious. Theſe were the men that ſerved me to moſt advantage, and which I inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly united to the fourth faction, becauſe they reſolved, if they muſt loſe their old Maſter, to have no other but me. Thus I made advantage of the variety of mens inclinations, governing all theſe Cabals, every one in a particular manner, and with ſuch addreſs that none of the reſt had the leaſt ſuſpition of it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time as all the Paſſages of my life have made me appear of an amorous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, all the Beauties of the Town, and ſome Ladies of Quality, ſought to engage with me in correſpondencies of Gallantry, ſome ſet on by the enemy, to get ſome tie upon me, others by the Nobility to diſcover whether they had any thing to fear from me for the future, that Nation being naturally jealous, and apprehending on this account the humour of ours; others ſtimulated by their own inclinations, and advice of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, to make advantage by their acquaintance with me, and hoping to govern me by it. But I ſhut my eyes and ears againſt ſuch charming Baits, being ſenſible that to juſtifie what was paſſed, I muſt ſtand more on my guard than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, and be more vigilant over my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were penetrated by all the World. My conduct hath given the lie to all the falſe reports were raiſed of me, for I refuſed all rendezvous
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57207:195"/>
that were appointed, nay, to receive particular viſits at home, of perſons that would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to engage me in all manner of hazards, and which one may aſſuredly ſay were worth enjoying. One adventure happened to me which will not be impertinent to relate; but I muſt firſt tell that being no longer in apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the popular tumults of the Market-place, I thought I ought to quit that neighbourhood, and lodge nearer the heart of the City, that I might be readier to tranſport my ſelf to all parts where my preſence ſhould be neceſſary. I made choice therefore of the Palace of <hi>Don Ferrante Caraciolo,</hi> one of the faireſt of <hi>Naples,</hi> which I cauſed to be magnificently furniſhed, where I appeared with more Grandeur, and all my Court with greater ſplendour. It is ſituated before the Church of S. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Carbonnare,</hi> where is the Tomb of King <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> and Queen <hi>Jane</hi> his ſiſter, the Founders of that Convent, one of the faireſt and moſt ſumptuous edifices of <hi>Italy.</hi> Before this Palace is a <hi>Piazza</hi> large enough to draw up four thouſand men in <hi>Battalia;</hi> here I ever after held my Reſidence. The day after I was ſetled there, going to Maſs at the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> where many Ladies were aſſembled according to cuſtom, and amongſt the reſt an <hi>Advocates</hi> daughter with her mother, about ſeventeen years of age, one of the moſt beautiful Creatures of the Town, as ſoon as I was on my Knees ſhe aroſe, and coming bluſhing to make me a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom curtſie, preſented me an embroidered Prayer-book, and afterwards retired. Maſs being
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57207:196"/>
ended, her mother preſented me a Petition which I granted, and ſigned on the Rails of the Altar. About ten a Clock at night ſhe was brought to my Palace in a Sedan, and ſent in word by one of my Chamberlains, that the Party that in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had given me a Prayer-book, was come to deſire a private audience according to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: I ſent her word that I was too farr enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in buſineſs to entertain her as I deſired, that I thanked her for her good inclinations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her to continue them, and leſt ſhe ſhould meet any ill accident going home, cauſed her to be attended by two of my Guards. I ſpoke not of this adventure that I might not prejudice her Reputation, and had the like Moderation on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other occaſions, that I might not for a little Gallantry, which could not have been concealed, loſe the good opinion I had taken ſo great pains to acquire, thinking my ſelf obliged to give Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Diſcretion to all, it being my continual endeavour to cauſe others to obſerve it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves within the limits of their duty.</p>
            <p>One Morning giving audience according to my cuſtom <hi>Onofrio Pagano</hi> Captain of <hi>la Pietra del Peſce,</hi> a man very inſolent and intimate with <hi>Gennaro,</hi> that never had any kindneſs for me, accompanied by a Fiſherman, of ſuch humour as himſelf, that was his <hi>Alfieres,</hi> turning angerly every way, brutiſhly told me, it was ſtrange I could not be ſpoken to without being heard and crowded, which obliged me to command my Swiſſe Guards to make place, and ſuffer none to come near, that audience might be private, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57207:196"/>
un-interrupted: his <hi>Alfieres</hi> would needs come on, and one of my <hi>Swiſſes</hi> ſtopping him, he gave him ſuch a blow with his fiſt on his Stomack that he fell on the ground. This impudence angered me, and going to him I ſtruck him on the head, which was bald, with my cane, in ſuch a manner, that I laied him all bloudy at my feet. His Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in an arrogant tone told me my Guards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be as inſolent as thoſe of the Vice-roy. I anſwered him fiercely, that I would make him know what was due to me, and that as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſhould be given to my <hi>Switzers</hi> when they were about my Perſon, as had ever been born to the Vice-roy of <hi>Naples:</hi> then commanding his Enſign to be ſent to Priſon, I ſwore to hang him without mercy. Their inſolence was immediately changed to ſubmiſſion, and falling on their Knees, they both begged my pardon, and that wretch his life which I refuſed, and he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Vicairie. Whileſt I was at Maſs, his Wife and Children with diſheveled hair came to beg his life, which I pretended to refuſe, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themſelves to the Ladies to intercede for them, at their Requeſts I granted what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and conditionally that afterwards he ſhould be more reſpective, ſent immediately to give him Liberty; this they promiſed for him, and went away very well ſatisfied. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon being at the Gate of my Palace expecting my Horſes to ride abroad, the People's Elect, who ſought nothing more than to embroil me, came in a great heat to tell me he would no longer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his office, becauſe it expoſed him to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:57207:197"/>
and that my Proclamations were ſo little obſerved, that one of the City Captains of the Suburbs of <hi>Loretto,</hi> who came followed by thirty Souldiers to ſpeak with him about buſineſs, had injured him in words, and his Souldiers preſented their Muſquets at him: I promiſed to do him ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the fellow at that inſtant paſſing before my door, with the ſame train, I asked him, if he had not notice of the Prohibition I had made on pain of death, to lead Souldiers in Arms about the Town, unleſs at the hours of ſetting the Watch, and eſpecially to go to the Magiſtrates followed by them; He told me, Yes, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of credit in his Quarter he might do what he pleaſed, upon which having cauſed him to be diſarmed and carried to Priſon, I returned to my lodging, to ſpeak about buſineſs with the Peoples Elect, and entertain <hi>Marco Antonio Brancaccio,</hi> that was come to viſit me. I was ſcarce entered into my Chamber when a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people aſſembled tumultuouſly in the <hi>Piazza,</hi> and above a hundred of the hotteſt came up my ſtairs, making a great noiſe in my Hall; and crying out, they muſt needs ſee me. I went to them and asked what they deſired of me, they told me that the people having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that I had impriſoned one of their Leaders, demanded his Liberty. I ſaid that to come in ſuch a faſhion was not the way to obtain favours of me; That this might have done well with <hi>Mazaniello,</hi> or <hi>Gennaro,</hi> but that neither my humour nor Quality could ſuffer it, and that it ſhould coſt their Camrade his life. That I
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:57207:197"/>
would have no Addreſſes made to me but on the Knee, and by Supplication; Three of the Ring-leaders arrogantly told me, the people would not have him die, and would take Arms to prevent his execution. I drew my ſword and being about to run it into the belly of the moſt inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, he fell on his Knees and weeping beſought my pardon. I told them all that to let them ſee I feared them not, he ſhould be hanged immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and turning to one of my Guards, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to give order to the Auditor General to cauſe him at that inſtant to be led to puniſhment, and ſee him hanged in the middle of the <hi>Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,</hi> and told the other Mutineers they were the cauſe of his death, for otherwiſe I would have pardoned him, and that I would therefore have them aſſiſt at his execution, and be reſponſible that there ſhould be no commotion: I will take horſe (ſaid I) immediately, and if I do not find my ſelf obeyed, or hear the leaſt murmuring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come back, I will cauſe you all to be hanged. They went away very ſubmiſſive and much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and a little while after I went to ſee what paſſed, and found all things quiet, and my Orders executed, and they that ſeemed moſt incenſed, coming to me, ſaid, You ſee how we have obeyed you, and there hath not been the leaſt diſorder. I was ſatisfied, and told them, Now you know me, learn that I may be moved by Supplications made with reſpect, but am ever inexorable to the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; go and be wiſer another time, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand better what you owe me, and what I very well know how to oblige you to pay me. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57207:198"/>
I viſited the Town and all the Poſts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to end the day at home in my ordinary Imployments. I ever comported my ſelf in ſuch a manner, that tumults ſerved onely to adde to my reſpect and authority</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Gennaro, Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> and the Peoples Elect, endeavoured ſecretly to cauſe more Inſurrections, ſuppoſing that though I appeaſed many, it was impoſſible but at length I muſt ſink under ſome one; By new rumours which they every day ſpred abroad, they incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the rabble againſt the Duke of <hi>Turſi,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed that I was on no other account ſo careful of his preſervation, but becauſe he was neceſſary to my ſecret Correſpondencies with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and my Negotiations with them. Very few days paſſed in which I was not obliged to go to his lodging, and drive away the multitude which ſwarmed about it with deſign to do him miſchief. I was weary at laſt of this perpetual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and that I might provide the better for his ſafety, and free my ſelf from diſtruſting it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved him to a houſe behind my Palace, to the end that if the <hi>Corps de guard</hi> at his Gate was not ſtrong enough to ſecure him from popular tumults, I might reinforce it with that which was before my Palace, and which had order to march at the leaſt noiſe ſhould be heard. One day ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Knight <hi>de Fourbin</hi> to viſit him, he made great complaints of the <hi>Polonian</hi> Gentleman, who on all occaſions was very inſolent. My Guards confirming this, to ſatisfie him, and puniſh the others imprudence, I cauſed the <hi>Pole</hi> to be ſent
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57207:198"/>
to Priſon, and placed in his Room the Baron <hi>de la Garde,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Provence,</hi> in whoſe Diſcretion and Vigilance we had both of us great cauſe to be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>I am deſirous here to juſtifie my ſelf of an accuſation, that my want of Money conſidered, I took not the advantage of his Ranſom, which for two Reaſons I omitted, the firſt is that I thought it beſt to keep him, to have an exchange ready for my Brother, in caſe he ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately taken in his journey to me. The ſecond, that making his offers to pay his Money at <hi>Genoua</hi> and no where elſe, I ſhould have had too great trouble in ſending for it, Navigation being very hazardous at that time of the year, that I had no Gallies, and thought it not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to venture ſo conſiderable a ſumme in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucca's,</hi> and more that he would not pay the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney till he ſhould be arrived in <hi>Genoua,</hi> and was a man likely enough to lay a deſign to take it back again upon the way from thoſe I ſhould entruſt to bring it to me.</p>
            <p>I was afterwards blamed that I had not ſent him to <hi>Portolongone,</hi> becauſe he and his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child would have been conſiderable enough to have redeemed me out of the hands of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> when a while after I was ſo unfortunate as to fall into them. My enemies, that never loſt any occaſion of doing me hurt, would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly accuſed me, that rejecting all dependance on <hi>France,</hi> I did not enough confide in her to put ſo conſiderable Priſoners into her hands: Had I been willing to have done this it was not in my
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:57207:199"/>
power, becauſe of the neceſſity of my expectance of the arrival of the French Gallies, there being no poſſibility of ſending him by Land, and through the Popes Territories, and as little of hazarding him on <hi>Felucca's,</hi> which might eaſily have been taken by the enemies Gallies or Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantines, neither could I truſt Marriners, who might be corrupted with the temptation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their fortunes, or according to the bloudy inclination of vulgar <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> murther him and his Grandchild, when they ſhould be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger awed by my Preſence. All which reaſons ſeriouſly conſidered, make it appear there was no more ground for blaming me on this occaſion, than on the reſt, wherewith on ſo ſlender proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities they ſought to do ſo ill Offices.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> perceiving ſo little ſucceſs in the attempts they had made upon me, the extremity of their affairs cauſed them to have recourſe to all manner of ways to preſerve themſelves from ruine, and they conſulted the Nobility for reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to ſo preſſing miſchiefs: They ſent likewiſe to Cardinal <hi>Filomarini</hi> for his Counſel, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring with <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> founded <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and all of them made this reſult, that the people having an extraordinary hatred and diſtruſt for the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> all that had paſſed being laid at his door, and the authority taken from him, and put into the hands of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> a good effect might be produced: That the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his quality, and of the affection the King his Father had for him, would obtain credit to whatſoever he ſhould promiſe on his behalf,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57207:199"/>
it being to be judged, he ſhould not be diſavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that a young and ambitious Prince, that was ſo ſollicitous a purſuer of honour, would be a religious obſerver of his Word, and facilitate all things, that he might by any conditions how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous ſoever, preſerve to <hi>Spain</hi> a Crown that ſeemed already loſt, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hoping that if they could once diſarm the people, and put an end to their ſeditions, they ſhould in ſuch a manner fortifie themſelves, that they might in time re-eſtabliſh their power, and reſtore all things to their firſt condition, and obſerve no more of their promiſes than ſuch as they liked, eſpecially after the peace with <hi>France,</hi> towards which their Miniſters at <hi>Munſter</hi> uſed all poſſible endeavors. Though the execution of this deſign followed not till ſome time after, yet its Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Projects being now ſet afoot, I thought it not amiſs to anticipate the relation a few days.</p>
            <p>The Nobility entruſted the Prior <hi>John Baptiſta Caraciola</hi> a Knight of <hi>Malta, Don Diomede <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That his perſon ſo courteous
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57207:200"/>
and agreeable, would win the hearts of all men, as well as his birth cauſe all manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and that none would apprehend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of a Father, whileſt ſo dear a ſon me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated his affairs, and demanded favours would be joyfully granted, to gain him greater affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and authority: and that this being the laſt remedy for Preſervation of <hi>Spain,</hi> their opinion was it ought to be made uſe of, ſo to oblige all to comply with their duty; That the Duke of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos</hi> being unfortunate, would be eaſily made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear guilty; that he could never regain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation he had loſt; That the rcſentment of all that was paſſed would eaſily light upon him, that to diſpoſſeſs him, though by his own conſent, would look like a puniſhment, which would ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the people, and calm their rage, which uſually ceaſes, as ſoon as a ſubject is held out on whom to divert it, and that they would then without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, give a more favourable ear to Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when in ſtead of puniſhments, no mention ſhould be made but of Clemency, Pardon, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable Uſage.</p>
            <p>One Morning whileſt I was at Maſs at the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites,</hi> a Prieſt was brought to me, one of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Filomarini</hi>'s Domeſticks, who had been taken returning from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Quarters, with ſeveral Letters from his Maſter and others. He told me his Maſter had ſent him about particular buſineſs, eſpecially to put an end to ſome diſorders happened amongſt religious Perſons, and that he came from the <hi>Internuncio,</hi> to whom he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered certain diſpatches from <hi>Rome.</hi> The people
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57207:200"/>
was not ſatisfied with theſe poor excuſes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to take heat, were ſo farr tranſported as with great exclamations to ſay, they would kill the Cardinal in his Palace, ſince he betrayed them and held correſpondence with their enemies. I read ſome of the Letters, and judging, that what advantage ſoever I might receive by letting looſe the reins to the peoples fury, and quitting my ſelf of ſo dangerous an enemy, the conſequences might be very bad, and the death of a Cardinal exaſperating the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> would acquire the Popes indignation, with Cenſures, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, and interdictions againſt the whole Town, which by troubling the ſcrupulous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the people of that Countrey would very much alienate their inclinations from us. That our enemies might make uſe of this, and would rejoyce in the death of a Cardinal, in whom they had no entire confidence, and of whom they made uſe out of meer neceſſity. I reſolved therefore to ſecure him from violence, and endeavour abſolutely to gain him, by ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential an obligation. Therefore making a ſign to the people to hear me, I told them; You un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, my friends, that the Cardinal our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop ever tenderly loved us, as a true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Father: that he hath given us teſtimonies of this upon all occaſions, that he ever diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the tyrannical proceedings of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who incapable of pardoning him, continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour his deſtruction, of which they would enjoy the advantage, and make us bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the indignation and Reſentment of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:57207:201"/>
What hath now happened is no more than one of their uſual Artifices, imagining that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration we would ſuffer our ſelves to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to that which would entirely ruine us: let us avoid this ſnare they have ſo cunningly and maliciouſly laid; I underſtand the Cardinals inclination for us, which he hath often declared to me, let us love and reſpect him as we ought, and diſtruſting the malice of our enemies, do the contrary of all they expect: They would have us deſtroy him, let us endeavour to preſerve him to us in their deſpite, and diſcovering to him their enterpriſes againſt his life, encreaſe his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for them, and his friendſhip to us. I will go and inform him of all and you ſhall ſee, that I will deal in ſuch a manner with him, as to gain us the friendſhip of <hi>Rome</hi>; let us then retort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that <hi>odium</hi> they pretend to caſt upon us. The people having ever had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary affection and reſpect for him, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived it in the hearts of them all, who unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly cried out, We own him for our Father, and inſtead of killing him as the enemy would have us, we will love him more. He ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected us, and never gave us occaſion to diſtruſt him, give him this aſſurance in our name, and that we will revenge him on the horrible perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> againſt whom for his ſake we will make war without Quarter, and not put an end to our reſentment till we have the life of the laſt <hi>Spaniard</hi> that ſhall remain in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Leaving the people in the humour I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:57207:201"/>
into them, I went to him taking along with me all the Letters, ſending him word by a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that I was coming about an affair of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary importance. I met him as he came from ſaying Maſs, and being ſeated and the Chamber door ſhut, that we might not be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nor over heard, told him, My Lord, you may judge whether my friendſhip be uſeful to you, ſince had it failed, you had not been alive at this preſent. I come from appeaſing the people ſo incenſed againſt you, that if my credit and diſcourſe had not pacified them, they had come tumultuouſly to kill you, and drag you about the Streets. It is happy for you that the authority is no longer in the hand of a <hi>Mazaniello</hi> or <hi>Genna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> but in a mans of my condition and inclination, that have all manner of reſpect for the Papacy, and Veneration for the Purple inveſts you, with eſteem and affection for your perſon, and that being paſſionately deſirous of your good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will make uſe of all manner of endeavours to merit it by ſerving you. This diſcourſe made him tremble, and drew tears from his eyes, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported partly by fear and partly by gratitude, he was ready to caſt himſelf at my feet. You ought, ſaid I, to concern your ſelf in my preſervation, for whileſt I live you need fear nothing. I have allayed the ſtorm that threatned you, and I will bring you anon the beſt of the people to aſſure you of the general affection and reſpect of the Town. I cannot but tell you that you were ſo near ruine, that none but my ſelf could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it ſo eaſily and ſucceſsfully. One that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:57207:202"/>
to you was taken bringing you Letters; for your ſake I cauſed him to be diſmiſſed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, but it is juſt that you give me ſome light of your Negotiations, and it is unreaſonable that I ſhould continue in danger, becauſe I have ſaved you from it. I very well perceive theſe Letters treat of ſomething elſe than affairs of Friers, and this Cloyſtera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Canting is only to conceal conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Correſpondencies and Negotiations. Theſe words <hi>General, Provincial, Prior</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> are appliable to more eminent Perſons, and it is not the <hi>Surplice</hi> nor Myſteries of Religion that are here intended; you ought not to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, but to deal with me more frankly and confidently, becauſe my eyes are too open to be eaſily lulled aſleep in matters of ſuch importance, which concern no leſs than my honour, liberty, and life.</p>
            <p>At laſt we read together all the Letters, of which I demanded the explication. After a long amuſing me by inconſiderable juſtifications, and frivolous excuſes, he was forced (finding I would not be ſo impoſed upon) to make me a general confeſſion, and acquaint me that the renunciation of the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> and putting the authority into the hands of <hi>Don John</hi> was in agitation, and that his ſenſe thereupon being demanded, he had frankly given it. That as Archbiſhop he thought himſelf obliged to employ his utmoſt endeavors to appeaſe the diſorders of his Dioceſe. That the tyranny of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and rage and brutality of the people, had always equally diſpleaſed him, that he thought by this means Peace and Quiet
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:57207:202"/>
might be eſtabliſhed, and that caſting back the <hi>odium</hi> of all that was paſſed upon the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> and imputing to him the ill conduct of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the violence of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, more credit would be given to the word of a young Prince, authoriſed by his fathers affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that would concern himſelf to make good the Pardons, and maintain the Priviledges he had promiſed, That the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> now ſo near its ruine, would be by him preſerved, at what price ſoever; that any conditions might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, to which he would moſt joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully condeſcend, that he might not loſe all by pretending to too much. That I could not blame his proceedings, ſince I would doubtleſsly do the ſame my ſelf were I in his place; and for what concerned me, that my conduct had been ſo obliging and prudent, that his firſt thoughts had been to provide for my ſafety, and that it was but juſt to have a care of the Preſervation of a Perſon, to whom both Town and Countrey owed the Eſtates of the moſt conſiderable, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of all Families, ſince at the day of my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, devaſtations, plunderings and murthers ceaſed, I having eſtabliſhed greater order and quiet, than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could ever do in their higheſt proſperity.</p>
            <p>I anſwered him that this ſo vindicative Nation would not change its inclinations with the change of a Governour, that Lions, though tame, are ſtill to be apprehended. That we could have no more confidence in <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> than in the Duke of <hi>Arcos:</hi> that we very well underſtood
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57207:203"/>
Reſolutions were not taken by particular Perſons. That nothing was done but by order of the Councils, whoſe Maximes changed not. That their puniſhments were nothing the leſs to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for being delayed, becauſe they never failed to arrive at laſt. That I had made the <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi> too ſenſible of theſe Verities, to ſuffer themſelves to be lulled aſleep or ſurpriſed, that they could neither enjoy Repoſe nor Safety as long as one <hi>Spaniard</hi> was left in the Kingdom, that affection to his Countrey ought to inſpire him with the ſame thoughts, that his ſervices would at laſt be recompenſed with ingratitude, that recourſe was had to him out of meer neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that the intereſt he had amongſt ſome of the people would be imputed to him as a capital crime. That he would one day ſuffer on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, never being able to obtain an entire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor (the advances he had already made conſidered) eſcape the revenge of an incenſed, cruel, and bloudy Nation. That I would gladly adviſe him to concern himſelf no more (as he had hitherto done) in all their Negotiations, where he could not obſerve ſo juſt a counterpoiſe but one or the other party being ill ſatisfied, and jealous of him would equally put him in danger of his life, which I had now ſaved, but perhaps another time ſhould not be able to effect. That I conjured him no more to expoſe himſelf to ſo great danger, but to ſit ſtill in expectation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens diſpoſal of all things, it being to no purpoſe for him to go about to oppoſe its decrees.</p>
            <p>He promiſed to make a good uſe of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57207:203"/>
and never forget the obligation he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged he had to me, but all his life concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in my ſecurity and advantage; I told him he might very eaſily give me a convincing teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of this, by diſcovering to me what perſons of the Town I might confide in, and whom I was to diſtruſt. I cannot, ſaid he, break the Oath of ſecrecy I have made, beſides that poſſibly you would not believe what I ſhould tell you. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, ſaid I, I have preſſed you too farr, and I underſtand well enough on whom to fix my ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitions, and I earneſtly beſeech you to comport your ſelf ſo, that they may never ſettle on you. He gave me all aſſurances poſſible, and I left him, thinking I had done enough, by preventing him (out of conſideration of the hazard he had run) from maintaining afterwards any ſuſpicious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies, which he a while forbore, if he did not exactly obſerve all he had promiſed me.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon I carried to him ſome of the principal Citizens, who acquainting him with the danger he had eſcaped told him what I had done in order to it, and aſſured him that this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had augmented the peoples confidence and friendſhip for him, and redoubled their hate and reſentments againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> By this he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood how powerfully I could divert mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations by my addreſs and credit.</p>
            <p>The great want of Proviſions amongſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> made me reſolve to cut off all poſſibility of their receiving any by Land, yet I apprehended leſt deſpair might oblige them to attempt to clear the way of <hi>Capua,</hi> from whence they might eaſily
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57207:204"/>
paſs to <hi>Puzzolo,</hi> but their way from <hi>Puzzolo</hi> to <hi>Naples</hi> was cut off by the Village of <hi>Fora Grotta,</hi> in my poſſeſſion, of which I thought they might ſometime or other make themſelves Maſters, if I had not the Tower of <hi>Pied de Grotta,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Suburbs of <hi>Chiai,</hi> which, of all thoſe of the Town, only held for them. In order to this, the tenth of <hi>January,</hi> I walked to the Convent of <hi>Camaldolis,</hi> ſeated on a hill, from whence I could at my eaſe conſider all that Suburb, and the Tower I deſigned to cauſe to be attacqued next Morning. The Proſpect of this Convent is one of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt in the World, but that which beſt pleaſed me was that after a diligent obſervation of the ſituation and avenues of the Tower of <hi>Pied de Grotta,</hi> a Paſs ſo neceſſary for my deſcent into the Suburb, I perceived the enterpriſe to be eaſie, provided it were vigorouſly attempted. At night I ſent for <hi>Jacomo Roſſo,</hi> and commanded him to take three hundered men of his Regiment and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque it. It is an antient <hi>Roman</hi> building, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to a Convent of Friers, and near <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Tomb, where ſomething very remarkable is to be ſeen; the Tomb is of white Marble, with a Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Arch, on the top of which, time out of mind, a Lawrel hath ſprung out of the Marble, without any earth for its preſervation; and the old one withering ſome years ſince, nature produced an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as if to eternize the memory of ſo great a Perſon by the Prodigy of a Lawrel, whoſe Branches have in all times been made uſe of, as well to crown the heads of Poets as Conquerors.</p>
            <p>The attacque of the Convent and of this Tower
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57207:204"/>
were vigorouſly made and ſeconded, from eleven in the forenoon till three after Dinner, when the Garriſon ſeeing no appearance of ſuccor, and that the Gate was fired with pitched faggots, yielded to diſcretion. There marched out ten <hi>Spaniards</hi> and twenty <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> commanded by a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Captain; The <hi>Spaniards</hi> I ſent Priſoners to the Vicary, and the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> took conditions with me. This having facilitated the entrance of the Suburb of <hi>Chiai,</hi> I commanded Serjeant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Alexio,</hi> (that had taken the Duke of <hi>Turſi</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner) with three or four hundred men drawn out of <hi>Vomero,</hi> and <hi>Lantignano,</hi> ſeconded by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Matheo d' Amore</hi> chief of <hi>la Vinara,</hi> which conſiſted of near upon two hundred good men, to attacque the Convent of S. <hi>Leonard,</hi> where above ſixſcore men kept Garriſon commanded by <hi>Joſeph Riva, Paulo Fioretti</hi> (who became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that famous <hi>Bandite,</hi> that having drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſeven or eight thouſand men, in the year ſixteen hundred fifty five, made all the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> tremble, and gave ſo great apprehenſion too to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) and Colonel <hi>Onofrio de Scio.</hi> The fight was hot, and laſted an hour: fearing the enemy might attempt to relieve it with <hi>Felucca</hi>'s, this Poſt being of extraordinary importance, and the Sea about it not deep enough for Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, I commanded twelve well provided <hi>Felucca</hi>'s to begin a little Sea-fight by beating back ſuch of the enemy as preſented themſelves, the advantage of which was entirely on our ſide. I had ſent <hi>Pione</hi> Captain of the <hi>Lazares</hi> with thirty of his men to carry <hi>Faſcines,</hi> and ſerve as <hi>Pioniers</hi> at this little
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:57207:205"/>
ſiege, who beginning to fire the Convent on all ſides, the beſieged having no hope of relief, nor able to defend themſelves any longer, were forced to yield to diſcretion: The Souldiers I divided amongſt my Troops, and the Officers tarried with me till I might have Imployments for them.</p>
            <p>By the taking this conſiderable Poſt, ſtanding on the Sea-ſide, and whoſe ſituation makes it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſtrong, and eaſie to be defended, I became Maſter of all the Suburb of <hi>Chiay,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo ſtreight'ned, that they had no more commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication by land with the reſt of the Kingdom. My men encouraged by this good ſucceſs advanced to the very Gate of <hi>Chiay,</hi> where finding a weak Guard they charged it ſo ſmartly, that they beat the men back and entered pell mell amongſt them. They were in a condition to have purſued their Victory to the middle of the enemies Quarters, if the Baron of <hi>Batteville</hi> had not come in with a conſiderable body of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> foot, and reformed Officers. A skirmiſh began which laſted three quarters of an hour, the advantage inclining ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to one ſide ſometimes to the other: but at laſt my men were fain to give way to the greater number, and retreat to the Convent of S. <hi>Leonard,</hi> and the Palace of <hi>Don Pedro de Toledo,</hi> which we kept to the laſt. This was one of the remarkableſt and beſt fought actions that happened in <hi>Naples</hi> during all the Revolutions.</p>
            <p>The next day I viſited theſe two Poſts and walked in the Garden of the Prince of <hi>Biſignano,</hi> one of the moſt pleaſant of <hi>Italy,</hi> by reaſon of its abundance of <hi>Orange</hi>-trees, very much ſatisfied
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:57207:205"/>
in the acquiſition of this Suburb, as well by reaſon of its ſo greatly incommoding the enemy, as of its fair and delicious Walks. The Garriſon I left there began a chaffering with the enemy, which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage I made by it obliged me to allow, which laſted till the Baron of <hi>Batteville</hi> diſcovering it, broke it off, by cauſing two or three of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to be hanged. It was an exchange of Turnips and other roots for Powder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their extremity of miſery, for this ſmall refreſhment, giving us all that was delivered to them for guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Poſt.</p>
            <p>About this time a Phyſitian propoſed to me an enterpriſe upon <hi>Pitzo Falcone,</hi> which I eſteem more than the Caſtles, it being ſeated on an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, perpendicular almoſt on every ſide; it commands the new Caſtle, and <hi>Caſtello del Ovo,</hi> and with its Canon flanks all the Vice-roys Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. This I looked on as a very handſom deſign, but having well examined it found the execution ſo dangerous and difficult, that I thought not fit to attempt it. In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Cellamare, Achilles Minutalo,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar Blanco,</hi> the firſt Decon, and the two others members of the Collateral Counſel, ſent to me for ſaveguards for preſerving ſuch houſes as they had in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Quarters, foreſeeing that I ſhould quickly be maſter of them, ſince they could no longer defend nor continue in them, being unprovided of Victual, and their Souldiers become ſo feeble by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery endured, that they hardly had ſtrength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any duty; I was well pleaſed at this news, learning by it the extremity to which I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57207:206"/>
them, and my joy was augmented when two days after the ſame Prince of <hi>Cellamare</hi> a Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſe, very much addicted to his intereſts, fearing he had ill employed his Money in buying the charge of Poſt-maſter General of the Kingdom, the revenue whereof is very great, ſent to deſire of me the Confirmation of it; of which I gave him hope, provided I might be informed by him and his two friends of all that paſſed in the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Council. And indeed after this I had punctual advertiſement of what was done there either by them or other ſecret correſpondencies I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated.</p>
            <p>The Nobilities Army being in a manner all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed, and the few Gentlemen that continued together in <hi>Capua</hi> unable to ſuffer the command of <hi>Vincenzo Tuttavilla,</hi> made continual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, having a very great averſion for him. The Vice-roy therefore and Collateral Council re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to diſmiſs him, and leave the Nobility the choice of ſuch a General as ſhould be pleaſing to them, who by his intereſt might hinder the falling off of the reſt, and cauſe to return to him a good part of ſuch as had retired to their houſes. They all concurred to obey <hi>Don Lewis Poderico,</hi> whoſe Prudence and Valour had acquired him a general eſteem. This choice was approved by all men, and recruited the body of their Troops before almoſt reduced to nothing, and that in horſe and foot could make but fifteen hundred men. In fifteen days time they made it up three thouſand, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> giving them order to cauſe Corn to be ſent from <hi>Capua,</hi> they refuſed to obey it, that
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57207:206"/>
they might not disfurniſh themſelves of the little that remained, ſcarcely ſufficient to make their troops ſubſiſt; this obliged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſend to them the Baron of <hi>Goeſlan</hi> with the <hi>Burgundian</hi> horſe, they having no more Provender nor Forage, and deſirous to diſcharge themſelves of ſo many mouths, being reduced to the laſt extremity. Being very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to make advantage of all conjunctures, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated an intelligence with a Serjeant and three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers, to deliver me the Poſt of <hi>Donna Aluina.</hi> An agreement was made for five hundred Crowns, of which I payed them two by advance. The day that this enterpriſe ſhould have been put in execution, the Serjeant either repenting of his treaſon againſt his Nation, or deſirous to keep to himſelf all the Money he was to ſhare with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, went to the Baron of <hi>Batteville,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered all, after aſſurance of indemnity, and to inherit the Spoils of his Camrades. The day the Poſt was to be delivered, the Baron came thither, having cauſed the Traitors to be hanged, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted reformado Officers in their places, who ſpoke with one I had ſent to diſcover, whether it was eaſie to execute that which had been contrived. They ſhewed him the weakneſs of the Guard, which <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teville</hi> had cauſed to draw off, ſtanding behind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered with two hundred reformado's. I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted the facility that appeared in the buſineſs, and the negligence of the Guard on ſo conſiderable a Poſt; yet I cauſed the Troops to march at the hour appointed, and the diſguiſed Souldiers having them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves begun to ſlight their works, I cauſed them to be narrowly obſerved by him that had treated with
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:57207:207"/>
the former in my behalf, who brought me word that theſe were new faces, whereupon I ordered them at our arrival to be fired on, that their deceiving me might be puniſhed by their deaths. <hi>Batteville</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the alarm was received by my men with a great Volley, and perceiving by their not advancing that he was diſcovered, made it his onely buſineſs quickly to make up his breaſt-work, a skirmiſh fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for about half an hour of little loſs or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to either ſide.</p>
            <p>A lay brother of the Convent of <hi>Sancta Maria la Nova,</hi> one of the moſt conſiderable of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Poſts, came to propoſe to me a deſign of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing it by introducing Souldiers through the Formal: this is a certain Aqueduct which paſſes under all the Streets of the Town, carrying Water to the Houſes and Convents. I ſent a Perſon of Truſt to diſcover whether this were feaſible, where he was ſhewed a place would receive two hundred men, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court of Guard, ſo weakned by hunger, and tired by continual duty that they could hardly ſupport themſelves. As misfortune would have it, an old Frier that could not ſleep, having by chance ſeen this young Brother bring a ſtranger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Conduit of the Cloyſter, gave notice of it to <hi>Don Alvaro de la Torre,</hi> Lieutenant of the Camp-maſter General, who having cauſed him to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, by force of torment made him confeſs all he had negotiated; Not coming to me next Morning, nor hearing any thing from him in three dayes, I gueſſed my buſineſs was diſcovered, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to get information of it, learned that they had put him to death, and that I had failed in one of the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57207:207"/>
handſomeſt and moſt important Negotiations that had been managed in <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I reſolved to give alarms on all ſides three or four times anight, to tire out the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom I knew to be very much enfeebliſhed by fatigue and want, which reduced them ſo low that they could no longer handle their arms, nor take alarms. By this means I hoped one day to ſurpriſe them, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the negligence to which I had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed them. But ſeeing nothing at preſent could be done in the Town, I reſolved to attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abroad, and commanded <hi>Jacomo Roſſo</hi> to go to <hi>Puzzoli,</hi> the inhabitants having let me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Garriſon was weak, and that being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded, though but ſlightly, they could cut all its throats, and let us into the Town, which would give me a facility to attacque the Caſtle of <hi>Baiae,</hi> of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importance, by excluding the <hi>Spaniſh fleet</hi> from that Haven, that of <hi>Naples</hi> being ſo open that ſhips cannot ride there in ill weather. He marched with three thouſand men, and the Townſmen beginning a Skirmiſh with their Garriſon, the Marquis of <hi>Fuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calda,</hi> entered in his fight with conſiderable Supplies, which obliged my men to retreat after a light Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. Perceiving enterpriſes of warre not to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed very happily with me, deferring them, I had recourſe to addreſs and negotiations, and cauſed the Governour of <hi>Baiae,</hi> an old and covetous <hi>Spaniard</hi> to be ſounded, who ſenſible of the ill condition of the affaires of his Nation, hearkened to my offers, and after many Meſſages to and fro, in which I ſpent fifteen days, agreed to deliver me the place for twelve hundred Piſtols; At the ſame time I treated
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57207:208"/>
to poſſeſs my ſelf of the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> (where <hi>Monſieur de Fontenay</hi> had been tampering before) for a hundred thouſand Livers. Wanting Money for two ſo important enterpriſes, I gave him advice of it, that he might have theſe two ſummes in a readineſs. But believing his own intrigues better than mine, he returned no anſwer, and theſe gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the mean time the taking in of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable places of the Land of <hi>Lavoro,</hi> and Frontiers of the Eccleſiaſtical Dominion, opened us a way to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made it ſo free, that the Meſſenger paſſed twice, and amongſt others brought me the Knight <hi>des Eſſars,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Cauſans,</hi> the <hi>Sieurs de Beauchamp, de la Breche,</hi> formerly Captain of Horſe in the ſervice of Pope <hi>Vrbain, de Miniere, de Graville,</hi> the Baron <hi>de Rouzou,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Chabans,</hi> the <hi>Sieurs de Canherou, du Fargis, du Chalar,</hi> with ſeven or eight other Officers and their Servants.

ſtately Cavalcade, accompanied by all thoſe that could get horſes to follow him; and ſhewing himſelf in all the Quarters, viſited the Caſtles and Poſts, of which we had notice by Acclamations, Vollies, and Fire-works, that continued all Night. He afterwards cauſed a Manifeſt to be publiſhed, imputing all effects of the ill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the pride and avarice of the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> promiſing a general Pardon to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with the preſervation of their Priviledges, and not only the Confirmation of ſuch Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as had been made with them, but an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to their advantage, for which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to be ſecurity, omitting nothing that might unſettle their reſolutions. He writ alſo to Cardinal <hi>Filomarini,</hi> the Elect of the People, <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> and many other of the moſt powerful of the Town, the greateſt part of whom brought me their Letters unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken open; but <hi>Gennaro</hi> ſaying nothing of his, he whom he had intruſted with reading it to him, immediately gave me account of it, of which for ſome dayes I took no notice, to ſee what he would do; till wearied by his ſilence, one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he came to me, telling him I wondered he made a ſecret of ſo important a Diſpatch as he had received, he went immediately and fetched it, ſaying he had forgot to bring it ſooner, though his intention was to have done ſo; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted this bad excuſe, but afterwards obſerved him very narrowly, as one that held ſecret Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies with the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:57207:210"/>Two dayes after a Gentleman, that was a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cardinal <hi>Filomarini,</hi> who (though of the Spaniſh Faction) was my particular friend, never concerning himſelf in any thing that was contrary to me, and that had ſo much kindneſs for me, that he had given me very conſiderable intelligence of deſigns againſt my life, which I alwayes found to be true; coming to viſit me, told me, that if I would allow him liberty of ſpeech, he would acquaint me with ſomething of very great concernment. I heard him, and he repreſented, that having conſidered how I was abandoned, he looked on me as loſt; that the People hearkened after an accommodation, if which muſt be, it was beſt to do it my ſelf; for if it ſhould be concluded without my privity, the firſt condition would be my death, ſince it could not be done ſecurely whileſt I was alive; but that if I pleaſed, I might be the Mediator and Moderator of it, and find my advantages in it: that if what had been already propoſed came ſhort of my ambition, beſides the inveſtiture of the Dutchy of <hi>Modena,</hi> which ſhould be given me by the Emperour, <hi>Spain</hi> would furniſh me with Forces ſufficient to put me in poſſeſſion of it. He told me I might have the ſoveraignty of the two <hi>Calabria's</hi> if I pleaſed, all the ſtrong places of which ſhould be put into my hands, and that I ſhould have for ſecurity the Pope and Colledge of Cardinals, and ſuch of the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> as I would make choice of. I made a faint refuſal, ſeeming to be obliged by his good inclination; ſuppoſing by ſuch a diſſimulation ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57207:211"/>
to diſcover all deſigns that were in the Town, and all perſons inclined to an accommodation. The Peoples Elect, two dayes after came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me that the Town began again to want proviſions; that the People was weary to have continued ſo long in Arms without making any advantage; that the ſuccors of <hi>France</hi> being ſlow and incertain, and its Fleet likely enough to do no more at its ſecond arrival than formerly, it was to be apprehended, that <hi>France</hi> was glad of the extremity they were reduced to, that ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair might oblige them to caſt themſelves into her arms; to which that Kingdom would never conſent: more diſliking the French than Spaniſh Government. That he thought it beſt to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Propoſals of Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who, he was aſſured, would be more willing to treat with me than any elſe, and that it would be more ſafe for him to do ſo, becauſe otherwiſe my credit might interrupt all he ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. That the People freely put all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments into my hands, becauſe they could never diſtruſt my Conduct; that I might obtain good effects by a perſonal Conference, of which though I failed, the common hatred for <hi>Spain,</hi> which every day became cooler, would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled by it: And that in ſuch a Treaty (beſides the honour to have uſefully ſerved the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> by freeing it from utter deſtruction) I ſhould find for my ſelf eſtabliſhments capable of ſatisfying my ambition. That to this purpoſe a Truce of three dayes was to be made, and if I conſented to a Conference with Don <hi>John</hi> of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:57207:211"/>
               <hi>Auſtria,</hi> it would be accepted, he being very paſſionately deſirous of it; and that I being the more able and of greater experience, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of ſuch an interview would be certainly on my ſide.</p>
            <p>As this Diſcourſe ended, <hi>Gennaro</hi> came in and propoſed a Truce and Conference, by which I diſcovered the bottom of their thoughts and their ſecret Correſpondences, and in my heart ſwore the death of them both; but I concealed it, thinking it too hazardous openly to attempt their puniſhment, and anſwered them, that I attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their diſcourſe, more to their zeal for their Countrey, than their friendſhip for the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, whoſe humor (as arrogant in proſperity as ſubmiſſive in misfortune) I perceived they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not. That their promiſes ought not to be depended upon, nor we to be lulled aſleep with their fair words: That we could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, how after a condeſcention to advantageous Capitulations, their Fleet arriving and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited, inſtead of the Ratification they had given cauſe to expect, by ſo many ſolemn Oaths, they attempted to burn and ſack the Town, and put all its inhabitants to the Sword; that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations were not any other wayes moderated than by the extremity to which they were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and that coming ſhort of power to oppoſe their deſtruction, that was ſo near at hand, and ſo inevitable, they had recourſe to Artifice. That we could not truſt them: That they brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed nothing but revenge, though their Cruelty diſguiſed it ſelf under the appearances of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:57207:212"/>
and Moderation. That their two Perſons would be made the firſt Victims to their Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: That for my own part I reſolved moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly to obſerve what I had promiſed, either to die with my ſword in my hand, or drive them out of the Kingdom, and procure it that liberty of which it had given me the Title of Defender: I therefore exhorted them to follow me in ſo juſt a deſign, which would prove more eaſie than they could imagine. That I was clear-ſighted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to aſſure them of this, and would never willingly ſuffer the People to be impoſed upon; that I would unſeel their Eyes, to give them a clear Proſpect of what they were to fear, and what to do for their ſecurity and quiet; and that I declared to them, that I would look upon all ſuch as afterwards hearkened to any Propoſal of the Enemy (all whoſe offers ought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted) as Enemies of their Countrey, and that I would perſecute to the uttermoſt, and inflict Capital Puniſhment on any that for the future ſhould make ſuch diſcourſes to me as they had done. That I pardoned the indiſcretion of their zeal, that had ſo groſly abuſed them; but in caſe they reſolved to continue my friends, they were to comport themſelves more prudently, and have more fidelity and affection for the good of their Countrey. That I would advertiſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all that had paſſed, but with ſo much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſhould need to fear nothing, nor be ſuſpected of Treaſon and Correſpondence. They gave me thanks, acknowledging I was more diſcerning than they, and that nothing was
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57207:212"/>
more juſt or true than what I had told them; and that convinced by my reaſons, they heartily deteſted the malice of the Spaniards, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction they would for the future, purſue with hazard of their lives, and be ever ready to ſhed their blood for the Publick and defence of their Liberty.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were gone away I ſent for the Chiefs of the People, and gave them an account of this Conference. They ſeemed as much to approve my Conduct, as to be diſſatisfied with that of <hi>Gennaro</hi> and the Peoples Elect: <hi>Vincenſo Andrea</hi> more crafty and more cloſe, appeared not at all in theſe matters; but I held him not therefore to be the leſs dangerous. I gave charge to all thoſe Chiefs (every one in his Quarter) to inform the People of what I deſired they ſhould know; to obſerve carefully all the motions and actions of thoſe that had given us ſo juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion, and emploied ſuch as I moſt confided in, attentively to watch and give me advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all deſigns of the Enemy, who (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) would ere long ſet on foot ſome enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. I cauſed a vigilant Eye to be held on all that came from them by our Poſts to return into the Town. One morning I had notice (by means of my intelligence amongſt the Spaniards) that little Scutcheons of their Arms were to be diſtributed to all ſuch as were affected to their intereſts, that they might know one another, and joyning, fall upon our rear, in two or three attaques they intended to make, for facilitating their entring the Town, and revenging at their

pleaſure the ſedition and diſobedience of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. One morning at day-break, a Gardiner was taken about the Gate of <hi>Medina,</hi> coming from their Quarter with a great Firre-Box un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Arm, which having cauſed to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I found it full of little Scutcheons of the Arms of <hi>Spain,</hi> about the bigneſs of the Palm of a Hand, and queſtioning him what they meant, he told me he knew nothing. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him very much aſtoniſhed, I gueſſed the matter, and that they muſt neceſſarily be Tokens, by which thoſe of the Spaniſh Party might know one another; as Straw had in like manner been made uſe of, on the day of the diſorder and burning the Town-Houſe of <hi>Paris.</hi> I ſent him to the Vicary, and ordered the Auditor Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to go preſently thither and put him on the Rack. He confeſſed what I had ſuſpected, and accuſed a Prieſt and two others of diſtributing the like Scutcheons. I cauſed the Prieſt to be ſecured, the other two going away to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and a great number of the like implements being found in their Houſes. They were of that ſort of men that being unmarried, wear little Caſſocks, and have their Heads ſhaved, to exempt them from ſubjection to the Ordinary Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and be liable to that alone of the Nuncio; where their wicked practices find great impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Eccleſiaſtical Juſtice being leſs ſevere than the Secular.</p>
            <p>The Prieſt, under torment, confeſſed the ſame thing the other had done, and this being an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of very great conſequence, I reſolved to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57207:213"/>
have it examined and determined in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and to this purpoſe ſending for the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor General and three of the ableſt Advocates in the Town, in whom I had confidence, cauſed the two priſoners to be brought me in Sedans, they not being able to go by reaſon of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they had ſuffered. I examined them my ſelf, and they confeſſed they had already diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted a great many of theſe Scutcheons, and that more would yet be brought. That Twenty thouſand men would wear them in their Hats or on their Breſts, and that on the day appointed at three in the morning, the Spaniards intending to attaque three or four of our moſt important Poſts, all of their party ſhould with ſuch Badges come in to the Allarme, and charge our men in the rear; by which means they hoped to enter and poſſeſs themſelves of the Town. I demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who were the Heads of ſuch as were thus to be employed? and they anſwered, that knowing they were to die, they would not diſcover the particulars of the enterpriſe, that they might not cauſe its failing, ſince all they could ſay would not ſave their lives; and that by the ſucceſs of the deſign they hoped to be revenged, and ſerve their King: on which account they would die joyfully. I ſent them back to Priſon, and after Conſultation of what was to be done, they were condemned to die; but that firſt of all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor General ſhould endeavour by force of Torments, to get greater light of ſo dangerous a Conſpiracy; and that they ſhould be racked (according to the uſual Saying of that Countrey)
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57207:214"/>
               <hi>tanquam Cadaver</hi>; and even to the point of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Torture. They were almoſt torn in pieces, yet would confeſs no more than what they had done at firſt, and the next morning were hanged in the Market-place, with ſome of the Scutcheons about their Necks. At the Gallows they began to preach to the People their return to the obedience of <hi>Spain,</hi> which haſtened their execution.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, their Conſtancy (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon) much diſquieting me, I cauſed exact ſearches to be made in all ſuſpected Houſes, and in the greateſt part of the Convents, but no more Scutcheons were found, nor any body that would carry the Arms of <hi>Spain.</hi> This had like to have cauſed great diſorders, and they that ſought occaſions of plundering, ſpread reports that Arms were concealed in many places; that under pretence of ſearching Houſes they might rob them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gennaro</hi> acquainted me that in the Convent of the <hi>Jacobins</hi> of St. <hi>Mary de la Sanita</hi> men lay concealed in Cellars wiih a great many Arms, to furniſh the <hi>Black Cloaks</hi> of the <hi>Virgins Suburbs,</hi> and that ſearch ought to be made. The People was diſturbed at this news, and <hi>Gennaro</hi> offered himſelf (accompanied by the rabble) to make the Viſit. I inſtantly underſtood his meaning, and the danger, leaſt the animoſities between the <hi>Black-Cloaks</hi> and <hi>Lazares</hi> ſhould again bring upon us the ſame inconveniences, which I once before found ſo much trouble to remedy. I went therefore my ſelf after dinner, forbidding
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57207:214"/>
on pain of death any to go before, or follow me, ſuch as I made choice of excepted. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Matheo D' Amore</hi> with his Company to poſſeſs himſelf of the Gate of <hi>St. Gennaro,</hi> and to ſuffer none of what quality ſoever, to go into the Suburb.</p>
            <p>After Dinner I took Horſe followed by my Guards, and commanded <hi>Pepe Palombe, Carlo Longobardo, Onoffrio Piſſacani, Cicio Battimiello,</hi> and <hi>Peppo Ricco,</hi> all Perſons of Credit amongſt the People, and in whom I confided, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me; and as I paſſed by St. <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s Gate I took with me <hi>Matheo D' Amore,</hi> and coming to the Convent of <hi>Santa Maria de la Sanita,</hi> having made my Guards ſecure the Gate, I went in and told the Father Prior and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial (who was at that time there to viſit) the intelligence <hi>Gennaro</hi> had given me, and the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I had diſcovered in a great many, under ſuch a pretence to plunder their Convent, which had obliged me to come in perſon to prevent any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; but that they might be free for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the like accuſations, which I looked upon as falſe and malicious, it was neceſſary that the Father Prior ſhould ſet open all places of the Convent (even to the Granaries and Cellars and other more private) to the above-named per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom I had brought along to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and whom I would cauſe to be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Captain of my Guards, to hinder any thing of inſolence. All the Keys were brought, and a general ſearch being made, nothing ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious was found, nor ſo much as one Fire-arms.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57207:215"/>
I returned very well ſatisfied, and commanded thoſe that had made the ſearch, to give the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple account of what they had ſeen; and ſwore in their preſence, that if for the future any falſe informations were brought me, I would cauſe ſuch to be ſeverely puniſhed, as could not juſtifie their reports, without which we ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in an extraordinary confuſion.</p>
            <p>At my return home, having paſſed part of the Evening in my uſual emploiments, <hi>Graſſulla de Roza</hi> Head-Jaylor, came to acquaint me that he had diſcovered a great Conſpiracy, and ſecured ſuch as were concerned in it, to the number of thirty, by carrying them priſoners to the Vicary. I pardon, ſaid I, on account of the indiſcretion of your zeal, the action you have done; but if you ever hereafter ſecure any without my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, your life ſhall anſwer it. He replied, he thought the buſineſs of great importance, and doubted the parties accuſed might have eſcaped, if he had delay'd to ſecure them; that he would be wiſer another time, and never afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like, ſince it was diſpleaſing to me; but that nothing could be more certain than this Conſpiracy: and after nomination of all the priſoners, he told me he had brought the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former with him. I conſidered the Names, and having obſerved amongſt them thoſe of the two perſons (which accepting indempnity) had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to me the enterpriſe of <hi>Tonno Baſſo</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my life; I ſuppoſed his Confederates whoſe lives I had ſpared, and who ſtill remained priſoners in the Vicary, might have a great hand
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57207:215"/>
in this, and that the intelligence given me was an effect of their revenge, and perhaps of their money.</p>
            <p>I ſent for the Informer, and conſidering him ſeriouſly, obſerved ſomething in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that gave me a very bad opinion of him; I therefore commanded him to tell me the truth, without diſguiſing any thing, telling him I ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his accuſation to be falſe, and that he was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with money, and that I had ſufficient proofs of it; that he ſhould have a care, for he was never in greater danger of his life; that in caſe he could make good his report, he ſhould be very well rewarded; and thoſe he accuſed (though I took them to be honeſter men than himſelf) ſeverely puniſhed; but on the other ſide if there were falſity and malice in the caſe, I would cauſe him immediately to be hanged. That he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well whileſt his life was yet in his hands; for if he told me not the truth before he went away, all the World ſhould not ſave him. I perceived he was ſurpriſed, and preſſing him home, he caſt himſelf at my feet, and begging his life, promiſed to diſcover all he had done. He then declared that a Notary called <hi>Calderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> priſoner in the Vicary, as one of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates in the attempt <hi>Tonno Baſſo</hi> would have made on my life, and another priſoner convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the ſame Crime, had given him a hundred Crowns to accuſe all thoſe whom <hi>Graſſullo de Roza</hi> had impriſoned; ſuppoſing that (as it had been in the time of <hi>Mazaniello</hi> and <hi>Gennaro</hi>) to accuſe them would be enough to cauſe their

deaths without any farther enquiry. I cauſed Paper and Ink to be brought him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to write and ſubſcribe all that he had told me, and let him know, that if he would enjoy the benefit of the Pardon I had granted him, he muſt juſtifie (without wavering or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back) to the faces of thoſe that had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him money, all that they had negotiated with him. I returned him to Priſon, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Auditor General to bring the two perſons he had accuſed face to face with him, and that his Teſtimony might be more valid, to put him on the Rack, yet without winding it up or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to ſuffer any torment. <hi>Calderino</hi> and his Companion had nothing to alledge, and fear of Torture making them confeſs their Crime, and ſubſcribe the Depoſitions of it, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed all on the Rack, which they afterwards ſuffered: of which as ſoon as the Auditor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral had given me account, I ſent to free the Priſoners, not thinking it juſt, that perſons, of whoſe innocence I was aſſured, ſhould lodge in the Jail. The two that were guilty, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die, and hanged the next day before the Gate of the Vicary, every one with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on his Breaſt, <hi>Falſe Witneſſes and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers of the Publick Quiet.</hi> This ſpeedy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice drew on my Head a thouſand Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, prevented falſe accuſations for the future, and revenge and envy from expoſing the lives of the innocent to danger, as they had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sovereign Authority came into my hands.</p>

               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:57207:217"/>The day after another Execution was made, which out of reſpect to Formalities I could not prevent, though looking on it as unjuſt, I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it unwillingly, and have ever had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe on occaſion of it. It was the death of a wretch that accuſed Colonel <hi>Melonne</hi> and <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> of Correſpondence with the Enemy, which I ever ſuſpected and at laſt diſcovered, but too late; I put him into the hands of Iuſtice; and failing to prove what he had declared, he was hanged.</p>
            <p>The Enemies Fleet disfurniſhed of Mariners, wanting carining, and ſupplies of Proviſions, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mienta</hi> its Admiral repreſented that theſe things could not be made good at <hi>Naples,</hi> and that it muſt of neceſſity ſet ſail for <hi>Spain.</hi> On this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a great Council was aſſembled, which found the inconveniences very great what reſolution ſo ever ſhould be taken; becauſe that by a ſtay they ſhould remain altogether unprovided, and their ſhips, become heavy by their foulneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable; and on the other ſide, by going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they ſhould be reduced to the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; wanting where withal to keep the ſea open from whence they received all their ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and part of their Gallies being gone with the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> no Naval Forces would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with them. The Baron of <hi>Batteville</hi> was of Opinion that the Fleet ſhould Winter at <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina,</hi> but <hi>Pimienta</hi> ſtill inſiſted for its return to <hi>Spain</hi>; it being impoſſible, in a ſhort time, in any other place to ſupply and repair it. His Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prevailed, and Don <hi>John</hi> conſenting to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:57207:218"/>
the Gallions ſet ſail with a very fair wind in the beginning of <hi>February.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Spaniards could not be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nor more near, ſince deprived of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by land with the reſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the arrival only of twelve French ſhips cutting them off from ſea, they were driven to have thoughts of abandoning all, which was thrice reſolved in their Council, and that they ſhould capitulate with me, that when they had forſaken the Caſtles, they might retreat to <hi>Gaeta</hi> and other maritime places, to attend ſuccors from <hi>Spain,</hi> and the return of their Fleet in the Spring; which at the time of their re-taking the Town they were alſo reſolved to execute, if the purchaſe of one of our Poſts had not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, or if they had been beaten off at their entrance: they preſſed therefore all of their party to make all poſſible attempts, which gave me a great deal of trouble and care.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Nobility to preſerve themſelves from being involved in their ruin, proteſted, that being intirely waſted by carrying on a War at their own Charge, as they a long time had done, they could no longer continue the expence, but muſt neceſſarily take ſome reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and enter into a nearer Correſpondence with me. The Spaniards ſenſible of the juſtice of their pretence, deſired their patience till the end of <hi>March,</hi> by which time the Fleet was to return; and the Nobility in teſtimony of their fidelity to the utmoſt extremity, promiſed to hold firm all the Moneth of <hi>April,</hi> but on the

firſt of <hi>May,</hi> neceſſity diſpenſing with the Oath they had taken to ſerve and obey them, they muſt do what ſhould appear neceſſary for their preſervation; I was advertiſed of this, and that preciſely on that day they would declare in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of me, or ſooner, if leaving the Town I would march into <hi>Apulia</hi> and head them; or in caſe the French Fleet returned, or I made my ſelf Maſter of the Caſtles; ſo that there was an extream impatience on all hands of the ſucceſs of affairs, and on which ſide Fate and Fortune would declare. I earneſtly preſſed the return of the French Fleet, and the journey of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Knight of <hi>Maltha,</hi> that I might leave him to command in <hi>Naples,</hi> and go my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Field, to joyn Forces with the Nobility, and returning from thence make the laſt attempt towards the Enemies deſtruction.</p>

               <hi>Gennaro Anneze</hi> all this while holding ſecret Correſpondences with Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every night ſent to him, of which I had punctual notice by thoſe I had gained about him; who having read all Letters he received, gave me account of them: being certain, as I was, to diſcover all his intrigues, I diſſembled with him, waiting a convenient time to ruin him, when I ſhould ſee him at the point of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting ſome Deſign. His Negotiations never arrived at any Concluſion, become ſenſible of the ſweetneſs of power, and his ambition ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated him, that the firſt Point of his Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ever was, to continue Head of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to have Fifty thouſand Crowns Revenue,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57207:219"/>
with the Title of a Dutchy or Principality, and to be the next Perſon to the Vice-Roy, to have Guards and be attended by them, to ſecure him from his enemies, and preſerve his life with his authority. The Spaniards diſcerning he had not credit enough to put the Town into their hands, and reduce the People to their obedience, went on ſlowly with him, amuſing him by great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, that he might on ſome occaſion be uſeful to them, principally for an attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my life; in order to which nothing was ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſuppoſing that while I lived I would croſs all their Deſigns, and that after my death all would be eaſie; their ſafety or ruin depending on my fall or preſervation.</p>
            <p>I was moſt ſenſibly afflicted, to learn by the Letters he received from <hi>France</hi> and the Kings Miniſters at <hi>Rome,</hi> that they looked upon him as ſo faithfully addicted to the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> that by his means only they expected all the advantages they pretended by the ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Naples</hi>; which he ſought to perſwade that I oppos'd by my particular ambition, and that my endeavors tended only to my own eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment and exaltation; ſo great Credit was given to all his fabulous relations, that the truth of mine was diſtruſted. The Miniſters at <hi>Rome</hi> perſwaded themſelves that my jealouſie of him, which was ſo juſtly grounded, aroſe only from my Opinion of his near Dependance on <hi>France,</hi> and that by it he prevented my being ſupplied. This prepoſſeſſion cauſed all ill offices imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be rendered me at Court, where I paſſed
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57207:219"/>
for a perſon that affected independance; that ſlighted all that contributed not towards making my fortune, and that endeavored to drive away the Spaniards on no other account than to raiſe my ſelf to their Throne. His power was not apprehended ſo much as mine, becauſe they thought he might more eaſily be dealt with, his low birth and little wit making him ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of diſſimulation, malice, or ambition. <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> much abler than he, ever obliged him to cauſe me to be ſuſpected, ſo to prevent my ſupplies, and compel the People by ſeeing themſelves abandoned) to ſubmit to their former bondage.

            <p>Many diſpatches from <hi>Rome,</hi> which acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally fell into my hands, diſcovered theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues to me, and to my ſorrow made me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He thought himſelf better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in <hi>Rome</hi> than I that had ſo near a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of theſe affairs, that laboured in them continually, and was expoſed to all imaginable dangers, without any thanks for my endeavors and all the perils I every hour underwent. He boaſted his Negotiations, which ruined all, and attributing to the Peoples animoſities and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:57207:220"/>
averſion for their antient Tyrants (though theſe languiſhed and were expreſſed only by injurious words) all our ſucceſſes, looking upon me as a happy Fantoſme, that contributed nothing but my preſence to my good fortune, and did no more than what any body elſe in my place might have done; whileſt <hi>Gennaro Anneze</hi> though ſo great a Traitor, paſſed for a faithful and good Frenchman, and I, whoſe reſpect, paſſion, and fidelity, were no wayes to be ſhaken, for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer and enemy of my Countrey.</p>
            <p>After my coming from Priſon, I was told by the deceaſed Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> that the Court had been either ill or not at all informed of what paſſed at <hi>Naples,</hi> but that above all he was ſurpriſed at their blindneſs in what concerned <hi>Gennaro</hi>; when by irreproachable Witneſſes I proved his perfidiouſneſs. I brought him from <hi>Spain</hi> the Baron of <hi>Batteville's</hi> Memorial print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Madrid</hi> after my impriſonment, in which (pretending recompence of his ſervices from the Catholick King) he alledged as moſt important, his ſecret Negotiations with <hi>Gennaro</hi> before my arrival at <hi>Naples,</hi> and all the while I continued there; particulariſing ſeveral advices of what he had managed and undertaken againſt me for the ſervice of <hi>Spain</hi>: and then Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> blamed me that whileſt it was in my power I had not as well puniſhed him as the Abbot <hi>Baſqui,</hi> againſt which I had nothing to pretend for my ſelf but my reſpect to <hi>France,</hi> which would have made an ill conſtruction of my intentions, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed me to have ſacrificed her Creatures to my
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57207:220"/>
Intereſts; and from thence have taken occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to have abandoned me. I thought I owed this Digreſſion to my honour, to diſabuſe the World of all the falſe reports that have been ſpread abroad concerning me. But returning to my Narration, I muſt diſcover a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſnare laid for me, from which I freed my ſelf by immediate preſence of mind, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs very extraordinary. <hi>Gennaro,</hi> by advice of <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> having raiſed a Tumult on pretence of the kindneſs I had for the Nobility, ſent fourteen or fifteen hundred men, which drew up in Battalia in the Piazza that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Pallace, which fifty or ſixty of the moſt factions entered, accompanied by a Franciſcan Lay Brother, who demanded to ſpeak with me, about Nine or Ten a Clock at Night. I gave him Audience, and he began to expatiate on the Nobilities ill uſage of the People, of whom ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had ſuffered much in <hi>Apulia</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; that all of them ought to be made a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to their reſentments, eſpecially the Prince of <hi>Monteſarchio</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Troya</hi> his Brother, for whom he thought I had particular conſideration; finding his diſcourſe to be very ſeditious, and tending only to incite the rabble againſt me, I led him to the far end of my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that none might over-hear-us. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to convince him by reaſon, repreſenting that if I did not ſeparate the Nobility from the Spaniards (which could not be done but by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes and all manner of good uſage) the ſtrength of their union, would be ſo conſiderable, we
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57207:221"/>
ſhould not be able to ſtand againſt it. This dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Frier raiſing his voice, in a very inſolent tone told me, that my kindneſs for the Nobility was very well underſtood, who being much dearer to me than the People, I intended to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up to their animoſities, as I had already ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed <hi>Michael de Santis</hi> to the revenge of Don <hi>Pepe Caraffa</hi>'s Kindred; and that ſince I would not ſend an Order to <hi>Sabbato Paſtore</hi> to cut the throats of the Prince of <hi>Monteſarchio</hi> and his Brother (which he might eaſily do) and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bandites to maſſacre all the Gentlemen they could meet with in the Kingdom, I declared my partiality for them, and conſequently my ſelf to be the moſt dangerous enemy of the People; becauſe I abuſed the Authority they had given me for the others deſtruction. I anſwered him, That ſuch a violence could not be without much danger, but that I aſſured him I would puniſh all the inſolent, and ſuch as tyranized or oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe of our Party. He grew hotter, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his hand in his Pocket to take out ſome Letter he had received, I perceived that all that were in my Chamber were moved, and near a Tumult, and looking on it as a Plot to kill me, and that nothing but a pretence was wanting, with my left hand, I ſeiſed that of his that was in his Pocket, and taking him by the throat with my right, cried out, <hi>Ah Traytor do you attempt upon my life, Guards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Guards! Auſtin de Lieto</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, I put him into his hands, and bid him ſearch him, telling him he had a Knife in his Pocket, which he was drawing to thruſt into my

The Captain of my Guards cauſing him to be ſearched in my with-drawing Room, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Knife in a Sheath, with a round Handle and a little Guard like a Dagger, was found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him; which being publickly ſhewn, they that were preſent, would have immediately thrown him out at the Window: but I told them it was of concernment to have him exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and brought to his Trial, to know who had engaged him to ſo deſperate an attempt; and calling for Pen and Paper, writ to Cardinal <hi>Filomarini,</hi> That unwilling to enroach upon the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, I ſent a Frier to him that would have ſtabbed me; that I beſought him to caſt him into a Dungeon, ſuffer him to ſpeak with no body, and care to be taken that he might not eſcape; to the end that ſo black an attempt might not paſs unpuniſhed, and that his Confederates might be diſcovered: that I hoped this from his goodneſs, which my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the Church might very well pretend to. Cardinal <hi>Filomarini</hi> exactly performed what I deſired of him, it being the leaſt he could do on account of the ſo late Obligation he had to me, for ſaving him from fury of the People; the conſideration of the danger he thought I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, augmenting his affection and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for me. My addreſs gave ſorrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to thoſe that had ſworn my deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſo well laid their deſigns, that they thought it impoſſible for me to eſcape them.</p>

            <p>Next morning going to Maſs at the <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> I gave Order to the Knight <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

cut off his Head, and the noiſe obliging me to return, tell me, that they had puniſhed his Treaſon agrinſt the People, and the Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies he held with Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi>; that this ſhould be juſtified by the Letters would be found in his Lodging, the Captain of his Guards having diſcovered to me the place where he had locked them up.</p>
            <p>This Plot ſo well laid, had not failed of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but for the diſloyalty of a Frenchman cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Baron of <hi>Rouvrou,</hi> who advertiſed him to have a care of himſelf, become jealous of ſome paſſings to and fro that he had obſerved; and becauſe ſome that were of the Plot whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed It will not be impertinent to give here the Character of this man, that what he did may be underſtood to be the effect of a black malice and not of imprudence. He was a Gentleman of <hi>Normandy,</hi> of as great wit as little judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, very extravagant, naturally as great a Cheat as Gameſter, and that would not want money, by what means ſoever he came by it, his Father not furniſhing him to his mind; he had neither Honour nor Conſcience, yet was couragious and reſolute. At the Siege of <hi>Aire</hi> he had been a Captain in the Regiment of the late Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> where after having loſt all his Equipage at Dice, he played away his Company; and apprehending the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Marſhal of <hi>Meillerai,</hi> coming in the night to viſit his Guard, which was on an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced Poſt, he went over to the Enemy and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf: where giving out that his affection
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:57207:223"/>
for me had obliged him to ſeek me, and follow my fortune, the Cardinal Infant ſent him to me. My misfortune and dependance on the Sedan Party, having engaged me in the ſervice of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in quality of General of the the Emperours Forces, he gave me advice of the retreat of the Marſhal of <hi>Meilleray,</hi> who having already ſlighted his circumvallation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be gone as ſoon as the place ſhould be taken. His intelligence found to be true, we marched with all diligence (forſaking the Heights about <hi>Teroane,</hi> where the Imperial and Spaniſh Armies had encamped, to prevent a Convoy and the conjunction of a conſiderable body led by the late Marſhal of <hi>Geſvre</hi>) that we might fall upon the rear of the French, which might eaſily have been done, but for the precaution of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, who poſting themſelves on an eminence, the day was paſſed over in a very hot Skirmiſh inſtead of a General Combat, which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards would not hazard: The Cardinal Infanta's ſickneſs, which at laſt proved mortal, having obliged me to retire to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> on occaſion of diſputes about the Command, <hi>Rouvrou</hi> followed me thither; but committed ſo many diſorders, that I was fain to ſend him away: he paſſed at laſt into <hi>England,</hi> where his ill Comportment cauſed him to be put in Priſon, with very great danger of his life. A year after he returned into <hi>France,</hi> his Treaſon unpardoned. One day in time of the Queen Mothers Regency, being in her Cabinet, talking with the Marſhal of <hi>Meilleray,</hi> we ſaw him come in, of which the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:57207:223"/>
Marſhal intended to give the Queen notice, that he might be arreſted and puniſhed; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him for my ſake not to do it, to which he conſented, on condition he ſhould never afterwards appear before him. I went to him and gave him notice of this, with advice to go to his Houſe, there being no ſecurity for him at Court. A little while after his return into <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> (it being impoſſible for him to continue long quiet) he brought himſelf into farther troubles, by cudgelling a Perſon of Quality of the Long Robe, out of jealouſie of a Woman, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt occaſion of offence. At the requeſt of the Earl of <hi>Menfreville,</hi> my particular Friend and Kinſman, I gave him a retreat in <hi>Meudon,</hi> unwilling to have him near me in <hi>Paris</hi>; where not thinking himſelf ſafe, by reaſon of the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions made againſt him, he deſired my Letters to my Brother, whom the General Citation had obliged to go to <hi>Malta</hi>; out of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the Turks would come and beſiege it.</p>
            <p>He went away with my Letter, and ſtaying at <hi>Rome,</hi> made uſe of it to coſen the Cardinal of <hi>Valence,</hi> and deſiring Audience of the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour in that Court, told him he durſt not ſtay in <hi>France,</hi> that he had wandered three years, and that his preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity compelled him to have recourſe to his Generoſity; the Earl, a Perſon of great Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, cauſed immediately a thouſand Crowns to be given him: he got ſomething alſo of the Cardinals <hi>Montalto, Albornos,</hi> and others of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57207:224"/>
that Faction; believing the miſerie he ſuffered was on account of his ſervices to <hi>Spain.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made up a conſiderable ſumme, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled the World, to practiſe his wonted Cheats in other places; and hearing that I was at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> he came to me, having firſt agreed with the Spaniſh Miniſters for Fifty Piſtols a Moneth, of which he received two Moneths advance, to be their Spie upon me; perſwading them I had great confidence in him. They ordered him to make acquaintance with <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and engage with him, which it was happy for him I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered not till I was a Priſoner: Being taken with me, he unhandſomely bragged he would ſoon be at liberty, and full of money, no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er concealing his diſloyalty, and cauſing all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther French Priſoners to be ill uſed; but being no more in a condition to do the Spaniards ſervice, becauſe too well known, he was caſt into Priſon, where he continued three or four years, with greater reſtraint and more narrowly obſerved than any of my followers. It was well for me that I knew and diſtruſted him at laſt, for he had otherwiſe done me a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; towards which his good will was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all occaſions.</p>
            <p>About this time a Gentleman of <hi>Genoua</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>John Grilli,</hi> rich and powerful, deſired of me a Commiſſion to command in the Plain of <hi>Sorriento,</hi> where his Eſtate lay; and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Town that bears the ſame Name, if he could take it; it being a place from whence the Enemy got part of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments:
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57207:224"/>
offering to make Levies and carry on the War at his own Charge. This is one of the moſt agreeable and delightful Countries of the World, the beauty of its Proſpect and Sweetneſs of its Air having invited <hi>Tiberius</hi> (when to refreſh himſelf after the weighty Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and the Government of the Empire, he abandoned himſelf to pleaſure) to make choice of it; retiring a nights for greater ſecurity to <hi>Capri</hi> a little Iſle, in a manner deſart, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommendable by Quails, which are taken in ſuch abundance that they raiſe the Revenue of a Biſhoprick; which gave occaſion to all the Hiſtorians of his time to ſpeak ſo much of the pleaſures of it. In a few dayes he drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Body conſiderable enough to take the Field, and oblige all the Towns and Villages thereabouts to declare for us. He ſent me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of this, with a Preſent of all delicacies produced by this Fertile Countrey; amongſt which its Calves are eſteemed the beſt and moſt delicious of all <hi>Italy.</hi> Afterwards he marched with three Pieces of Ordnance to beſiege the Town of <hi>Sorriento,</hi> but having none with him but Militia's and new raiſed Troops, that wanted good Officers, as he himſelf did Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Capacity to make War; when he had reduced the place to great extremity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attacqued by Three hundred Spaniards from <hi>Caſtelamare</hi> under Command of Colonel Don <hi>Gaſpar de Sultas,</hi> and the Lieutenant of the Camp-Maſter General Don <hi>Michael de Almey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> (the beſieged making a Sally at the ſame time)
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57207:225"/>
his men were aſtoniſhed and fled, and the Siege was raiſed with the loſs of his Artillery; yet he omitted not to rally his Troops and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Maſter of the Field, the Spaniards return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Caſtelamare,</hi> out of apprehenſion that their abſence might give <hi>Ceriſantes</hi> an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to take it, whom I recalled, finding he undertook nothing conſiderable; diſpoſing the Troops he commanded, part of them to <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> and part to <hi>Polite Paſtena,</hi> who continuing to make himſelf feared in the hither <hi>Calabria,</hi> reduced it intirely to our obedience; and having taken a Caſtle belonging to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs <hi>de la Bella,</hi> one of the beſt Horſemen of all the Nobility, found there twenty Horſes, of which he ſent me ſix the beſt and beautiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt that could be ſeen.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Fontenay</hi> omitting no occaſion of negotiating in <hi>Rome</hi> with all Neapolitans that were there, of whom the greateſt part were of the Province of <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> thought (with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough) that ſomething conſiderable might be attempted there, and to this purpoſe writ to deſire Commiſſions of me (which I ſent) to diſtribute to ſuch perſons as he ſhould like of; and as he thought it neceſſary to encourage and regulate the Natives of the Countrey by oldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Officers of Experience, he aſſembled as many as poſſibly he could, and ſent for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders the Marquiſs <hi>Palombara</hi> of the Family of <hi>Savelli,</hi> and <hi>Tobias Pallavicini</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Genoua,</hi> who had ſerved as a Field-Marſhal in the Kings Armies; encharging them very
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57207:225"/>
ſtrictly to receive no Orders but from himſelf, and to have no correſpondence nor dependance on me. But being Perſons of Honour, they gave me notice of it, ſuppoſing themſelves obliged to an entire ſubmiſſion to him by whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions only they were to fight. Many Banditi in this Province declared, of whom the moſt famous were <hi>Antonio Siſti, Martello,</hi> and <hi>Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia Ferro</hi>; and of the Nobility the Duke of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelnovo,</hi> Baron of <hi>Quinzio,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Bugnagno,</hi> the Baron <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo Alfiere,</hi> with his Brother, the Abbot <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparo, Hieronimo Castiglione,</hi> and ſome others, that cauſed almoſt the whole Province to revolt, took <hi>Chieti, Civita di Penna, Celano,</hi> and to the very Gates of <hi>Aquila,</hi> except the Caſtle and Fortreſs of <hi>Peſcara</hi>; all which was not done without much time. <hi>Julio Pezzola</hi> a famous Bandite, that ever followed the Spaniſh Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, having received ſome diſſatiſfaction from Don <hi>Michael Pignatelli</hi> Preſident of that Province, held Correſpondence with the Kings Miniſters at <hi>Rome</hi>; from whom having received Letters directed to me, he ſent them by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, that I might give the more credit to him, and offered me (in order to revenge himſelf on his Enemy) to ſurpriſe and take him with the Caſtle of <hi>Aquila,</hi> and to come himſelf to me with Three hundred Banditi, men reſolute and capable of all Enterpriſes. But being in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual diffidence, fearing his diſ-ſatisfaction might be but a pretence, on which the Spaniards thought to joyn him and his men with me, to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:57207:226"/>
kill me; I made very much of his Meſſenger, and returned Anſwer that the reputation he had acquired in <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> and his perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Countrey, made him more uſeful in that Province than with me; that he ſhould without loſs of time endeavour the ſurpriſal of the Caſtle of <hi>Aquila,</hi> which if he could effect, I gave him the Government of it, and all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, Lands, and Revenues he ſhould pretend to; ſuppoſing by this to diſcover the bottom of his thoughts, and that if he treated with me without diſsimulation, he might do me important ſervice and I hazard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>In the mean time no day paſſed in which there came not from <hi>Averſa</hi> many mules laden with Corn; and when I had drawn away the fifteen thouſand load the Enemy had amaſſed for their proviſion, I thought beſt to employ the money we had received for the bread, that had been ſold to buy the remainder of the Corn that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to particular perſons. But I was very much ſurpriſed, when taking account of it, I found one half leſs than I had left in the Town at my being there two dayes after it had been put into my hands: and that under pretence of coming to ſell it at <hi>Naples,</hi> a great deal had been conveyed away by paſſes, and as ſome endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to perſwade me ſold, to the Enemy. This cauſed the people to murmure, getting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, what care ſoever I took to conceal it. I ſent then to the Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>nce of communicating ſomething of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:57207:226"/>
with him, he preſently came, and leading him into my Cabinet to be more private, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him that my long knowledge of him would not permit any ſuſpicion of his correſpondence with the enemy, nor of his being capable of fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his fidelity to me; but that upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and cries of the people, I was obliged to inform my ſelf how our Corn came to be waſted; in which I could not imagine him to be any waies faulty, becauſe I did not only look upon him as a perſon of Honor, but would engage for his being ſuch if need were; and that he underſtood too much to be ignorant to what dangers want of proviſions muſt neceſſarily expoſe my ſelf and him. He anſwered, that he had been no leſs ſurpriſed when he found the Corn ſo much diminiſhed: but that I might conſider, that the Town of <hi>Averſa</hi> (being very populous) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Troops he commanded there, had conſumed a good part: that the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Towns and Villages had by my permiſſion carried away ſome which tended to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the bread made of it having been ſold in <hi>Naples.</hi> I replyed that theſe things might cauſe ſome, but not ſo great a diminution, but that I verily believed his paſſes had been counterfeited, and that his Officers had ſuffered greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities to be carried away than he allowed of; that his Secretary being a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> and having the reputation to be covetous, might be faulty, whom, to ſet him right in the opinion of the people, I reſolved to ſend to priſon, and caſt the fault there, (if any was) it not being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57207:227"/>
that I was aſſured of his own integrity, but neceſſary that ſuch ſuſpicions of the Common people, as the better ſort would never entertain of him, ſhould be removed.</p>
            <p>This propoſal ſeemed hard, ſince his Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary could not be accuſed without ſome reflexion on himſelf. I anſwered, that in preſſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities we are ſometimes forced to abandon our Infantery, and afterwards made him ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reproaches, (yet in an obliging faſhion) of what had diſpleaſed me in his conduct, which I rather imputed to the niceneſs of my humor than his fault, that ſince he underſtood me ſo well I prayed him for the future to let nothing be done (though of the ſlighteſt concernment) without my participation and order. That he might aſſure himſelf I continued my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted friendſhip and confidence in him, which nothing ſhould remove, provided that on his ſide he took ſome care to preſerve it: that he ſhould return to <hi>Averſa,</hi> and uſe all poſſible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to find out the cauſe of the waſte of our Corn; that he was too good, and ought by my example to learn to be more ſevere, ſince in matter of command we are to conſider no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but do juſtice (without reſpect of friend or foe) to all that merit either reward or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That we ought never to ſuffer Orders to be neglected or diſputed: that this was my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and opinion, which I thought very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that he ſtould act on this foundation, and then aſſure himſelf that nothing ſhould make a difference between us, how active ſoever malice
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57207:227"/>
might prove in order to it. Though <hi>Gennaro</hi> and I were upon very ill terms, yet formalities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing between us, I did not forbid him to ſee him, and (his endeavours moved by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> tending to diſſatisfie all that had dependance on me, or give me jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of them ſuppoſing me to be naturally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfull) he craftily cauſed me to be told that the Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> had viſited him, with long diſcourſe and many compliments, ſo to make me ſuſpect that they had made a combination, which I afterwards found was not ſo, but had been maliciouſly given out and ſeconded by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine de Lieto,</hi> in order to the deſignes I have formerly mentioned.</p>
            <p>The ſecond of <hi>February</hi> being <hi>Candlemas</hi> day, having given the charge of Rector of the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the Incurable to Father <hi>Capece</hi> my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, he deſired me I would hear Maſs there (which being the firſt time he was Pontifically to celebrate) and order my Muſick to attend; There was a great concourſe of people and many Ladies. This Solemnity was very great, but that which made it moſt agreable to me, was the news brought me at the end of Maſs, that the Admiral Gally of <hi>Naples</hi> was come in to us: She as well as the reſt of the Gallies was very ill provided, and <hi>Gianettino Doria,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Squadron of <hi>Naples,</hi> and ſince his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers impriſonment, all the reſt that ſerved <hi>Spain,</hi> having gone aſhore at <hi>Puzzole</hi> with all his Camerades, and greateſt part of the Officers, to hear Maſs at a Church of our Lady of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:57207:228"/>
the Slaves ſeeing ſo fair an opportunity to revolt, killed their Boatſwain, and forcing ſuch Officers and Soldiers as remained abord to guard the Gally, to leap into the Sea, carried her away, and run her aſhore at a place called <hi>la Gayole:</hi> I ſent immediately to endeavor to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her, ſhe being the beſt and faireſt that was in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> but being extremely brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by her ſhock againſt the land, I was fain to let her be broken in pieces, being othewaies uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. All the Slaves had their chains taken off, and the Turks having ſome days wandered about the Town, I drew them together, with ſuch as belonged to two other Gallies that had rendred themſelves to us, to preſerve them to be made uſe of when I ſhould be in a condition to ſet out any Gally of my own, and that they might not be idle the mean while, I made a Company of a hundred and fifty Turks, and appointed one <hi>Salem</hi> belonging to the Admiral to be their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. They were luſty and ſtout, and apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if they ſhould be taken, to be returned to the Oar, fought againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible ardor and animoſity, in ſuch manner that this Company alone did me more ſervice than any four of the beſt in <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had attempted nothing in a long time, and was now wearie of remaining uſeleſs, &amp; ſuffering the Enemy to be quiet. Inſtead therefore of ſmal attacques I reſolved to make a general one, and at once endeavour to become Maſter of all the Poſts the Enemy held in the Town, and force them to ſhut themſelves up in the Caſtles. To
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57207:228"/>
this purpoſe I gave order to <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> to bring me all the Banditi he could draw together, and to <hi>Polito Paſtena</hi> to do the like, and to the Inhabitants of <hi>la Cava</hi> and <hi>Nocera</hi> to joyn me with the greateſt number poſſible, chuſing the tenth of <hi>February</hi> for my rendezvous.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, to wearie the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and by continual fatigue make them unable to fight, I gave them every night two or three al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms' and as many in the day, at ſuch hours as I thought they repoſed; which added to their want of proviſions, brought them ſo low, that in all probability I was like to have them good cheap on the day of my attaque; in order to which I expected the arrival of the Banditi, and all the Troops I had ſent for to execute this grand deſigne. Hearing every day of <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s Commerce with the Enemy, and he perceiving mine and the peoples jealouſies, ſought to amuſe us by a falſe appearance of fidelity. He came therefore to give me notice that he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a plot of ſome of his men to deliver the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Tower to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The next day he cauſed <hi>Labati Gennaro, Franceſco Gior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dano,</hi> and his Brother, called <hi>Don Felice Giorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> though a Prieſt, to be hanged; accuſing them of correſpondences, in which himſelf was moſt concerned, and conſequently onely guilty. I did not yet accept this as current, neither did it abate my diſtruſt, being too well informed of all that paſſed; but it ſerved him to pacifie the people, who perſwaded by it of his good intentions, on the advanced Poſts called out in the night to
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57207:229"/>
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and asked why they came not to the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Tower, where they were expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and ſhould find ſuch entertainment as their Confederates had already met with.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, there happened a little diſorder before my Palace, which was inſtantly remedied A Colonel called <hi>Caſtaldo,</hi> a brutal and violent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſon, diſcourſing with a Captain cloſe by the <hi>Corps de Gard,</hi> heated by words that paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, gave him a box on the ear, which the Captain (accompanied by another that was his Camerade) unable to ſuffer, drew his ſword, and mortally wounded the Colonel in his thigh. The Guard immediately endeavoured to ſecure them, but their reſiſtance making a noiſe, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at the Window, I ſaw what paſſed, and above a hundred perſons with their ſwords drawn; I went down and inſtantly cauſed the two Captains to be diſarmed, and brought into my Palace, where I found the Colonel dying, the wound having happened on the crural vein: the ſuddenneſs of his death freed him from the puniſhment his inſolence deſerved. I cauſed the two Captains to be confeſſed, and a Scaffold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for cutting off their heads in the ſame place where they had been unmindfull of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they owed me. Many applications were made for their pardon, on pretence that a box on the ear deprives a Man of Honor of all conſideration: but I judged an example neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for containing others within the bounds of their duty, and preventing the like inſolence for the future, which any where elſe than within
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57207:229"/>
ſight of the <hi>Corps de Gard</hi> had been excuſable. <hi>Diego Perez</hi> their Colonel, repreſented to me that theſe two Captains being gallant men and of experience, might do me uſeful ſervice at the Attaque I Intended to make, but I continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, and cauſed them to be brought upon the Scaffold, and their eyes blinded. Execution being ready to be made, <hi>Mazillo Caracciolo</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting himſelf at my feet, begged their lives in the name of all the Gentlemen end Ladies of the Town: I told him, that vnable to refuſe any thing to interceſſions ſo dear and conſiderable, I pardoned them, and after a great repriment ſent them to be let blood, of which they had need.</p>
            <p>The Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> three or four dayes after his return to <hi>Averſa,</hi> ſent me word that matters had not been ſo much amiſs as I had been informed; whether it really was ſo, or that being of a good and eaſie nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would not accuſe his chief Officers, leſt I ſhould puniſh them, knowing my ſeverity ſeldom pardoned ſuch faults, eſpecially when made in contradiction of my orders, and as well for fear of a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our Army, which obliged him to conceal what he had peradventure diſcovered. I reſolved to ſend for him, that informations concerning the waſte of our Corn might be taken in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the whole Town (which was to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ſome appearance of Juſtice) crying out againſt it. He reſolved to obey and come to me; and I was told that <hi>Antonio de Calco, Marco Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſano,</hi> and <hi>Andrea Rama</hi> (fearing that if I took
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:57207:230"/>
the command from him, I might give it to ſome body that would be more ſevere, and not allow them ſo much liberty) taking leave of him, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him he ſhould ſpeedily return to head them, becauſe they would not obey any other, and that they had credit enough amongſt the Troops to oblige them to what they pleaſed, and compel me (willing or unwilling) to continue him in his employment, all of them uniting to depend on his fortune; that in caſe I ſhould be ſtill reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute to take it away, they would carry their men to the Enemy, being aſſured to be followed by them whitherſoever they went. The Officers took this laſt reſolution (which they confeſſed at their deaths) amongſt themſelves, and would not communicate it with him for fear he ſhould acquaint me with it; but having given credit to the relations, made me (on ſo probable appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances) that the agreement had been made on the day of our attacking the Poſts, which touched me very ſenſibly (though with great diſpleaſure) I reſolved to ſecure him,</p>
            <p>The Tenth of <hi>February</hi> in the Afternoon, <hi>Polito Paſtena</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> having left their Troops on their March, came to me, and after many civilities and aſſurances of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of the important ſervices they had rendered me, I carried them with me to <hi>Pog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio Reale,</hi> whither the beauty of the day invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to take the air. They preſented me their Chief Officers, whom I was very careful to careſs; and each of them having given me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of what they had done ſince their taking
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57207:230"/>
Arms on my behalf, I acquainted them with my deſign to make a general aſſault on all the Enemies Poſts, at once to make my ſelf Maſter of all the Town, and finiſh an affair I thought laſted too long.</p>
            <p>Towards Night I returned to employ that Evening as I did others, and having diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all buſineſs, ſhut my ſelf up in my Cabinet, to reſolve the manner of executing my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and putting the Orders in writing: which were, That Colonel <hi>Diego Paſſero</hi> falling out of the Cuſtom-Houſe, ſhould aſſault the Corn Office with Five hundred men, ſeconded by the like number of <hi>Nocera,</hi> commanded by their Officers under the Conduct of Colonel <hi>Landerio.</hi> That <hi>Diego de Soriento</hi> from <hi>Porto</hi> and <hi>Viſita Paveri,</hi> ſhould attacque <hi>Santo Bartholomeo,</hi> with the Five hundred men of <hi>la Cava,</hi> which he commanded as Serjeant Major, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Three hundred men deſigned for the guard of thoſe two Poſts, and two Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies each of them a hundred men, of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the People. That the Serjeant Major that kept <hi>il Fundo de Cedrangulo,</hi> and he that commanded in <hi>Cirillo,</hi> ſhould make two falſe attacques to amuſe the Enemy. That Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Pouca</hi> ſhould attempt the Poſt of <hi>Santa Chiara,</hi> with his Regiment, ſeconded by ſix Companies of the People, each of them One hundred men. That Colonel <hi>John Dominico</hi> ſhould attacque the Convent of <hi>Donna Aluina,</hi> with Three hundred men of his Regiment, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the reſt and three Companies of the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57207:231"/>
People. That <hi>Santa Maria la Nova</hi> ſhould be attempted by a hundred commanded men drawn out of the Troops of <hi>Polito Paſtena,</hi> ſeconded by a like number of the Forces of the People; of whom <hi>Mellone,</hi> Camp-Maſter General by Commiſsion, ſhould have the Command. That <hi>Polito Paſtena,</hi> with the Fifteen hundred of his men that remained, ſhould attacque Mount <hi>Olivetto</hi> and two other adjoyning Poſts, with ſuch numbers as he ſhould judge conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; cauſing them to be ſeconded by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder. That Colonel <hi>Landi</hi> with his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould amuſe the Enemy by falſe attacques about the Gates of <hi>Alba</hi> and <hi>Spirito Santo:</hi> That the Peoples Captains ſhould do the like on all Poſts where they commanded, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Gate of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> That Colonel <hi>Hannibal Brancaccio</hi> ſhould fall upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my about <hi>Santo Dominico Soriano,</hi> with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and cauſe the ſame to be done by the Company of Turks at <hi>Sangue de Chriſto.</hi> That at the Gate of <hi>Medina, Mattheo d' Amore, Carlo Longobardo,</hi> and <hi>Onoffrio Piſſacani,</hi> whoſe three Companies might make Five hundred men, ſhould make a <hi>Scalado</hi> with thirty Ladders, the Town walls thereabouts not being above eight foot high. That they of <hi>Lantignane</hi> ſhould give the hotteſt alarme they poſsibly could. That Colonel Don <hi>Bernardino Caſtro Cucco</hi> with his Regiment, ſhould by way of <hi>Vomero</hi> aſſault the Out-works of the Caſtle St. <hi>Elmo.</hi> That three attacques ſhould be made towards <hi>Chiaya,</hi> each of them by Five hundred men,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57207:231"/>
one at <hi>Santa Maria Parede,</hi> by commanded men of the Body belonging to <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> the other at St. <hi>Carlo</hi> and <hi>Les Mortelles,</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Diego Peres</hi> commanding at them both; and the laſt at <hi>Gli Angeli,</hi> a Nurſery of the Jeſuits, commanded by Colonel <hi>Alexio,</hi> and ſeconded by a Thouſand men of the ſame Troops, of whom <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> and Colonel <hi>Titus de Fuſco</hi> his Coſin ſhould take care. A Thouſand men were to continue as reſerve, from whom I would ſend ſuccors as I ſhould judge neceſſary; theſe were to ſtand in <hi>Battaglia</hi> behind the Pallace of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Gravina,</hi> where I would be my ſelf at day-break; it not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Musket-ſhot from any of the three at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques, who were equally within ſight of the Terrace of the ſaid Pallace. That the Horſe I had ſhould ſtand by Squadrons on the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, or before <hi>Porta Reale,</hi> that they might enter the great Street of <hi>Toledo,</hi> or puſh up to the Piazza of the Pallace, as ſoon as the way ſhould be opened. In all probability no reſiſtance could have been made to the execution of ſo great a Deſign (all things having been ſo well diſpoſed of) had my Orders been followed, my men done their duty, and my Officers been all faithful.</p>
            <p>Having in ſuch a manner diſpoſed of all things, I went to Bed to take ſome reſt, believing I ſhould have toil enough the day following. I roſe betimes, and after giving Audience went to Maſs, then taking Horſe, I viewed all the Troops that were come to me from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57207:232"/>
which I muſt acknowledge to have been the beſt I ever ſaw; eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples.</hi> They were Three thouſand and five hundred men, of whom the oldeſt came ſhort of five and forty years, and the youngeſt was above twenty. They were all tall and well made, with long black hair for the moſt part curled, Coats of black Spaniſh Leather, with Sleeves of Velvet or Cloth of Gold, Cloth Breeches with Gold Lace, moſt of them Scarlet, Girdles of Velvet laced with Gold, with two Piſtols on each ſide, a Coutelas (hanging at a Belt ſuitably trimmed) three fingers broad and two foot long, a Hawking-Bag at their Girdle, and a Powder Flaske hung about their Neck with a great Silk Ribbon; ſome of them carried Fire-Locks and others Blunderbuſſes: they had all good Shooes with Silk Stockings, and every one a Cap of Cloth of Gold, or Cloth of Silver of different Colours on his Head; which was very delightful to the Eye. <hi>Polito Paſtena</hi> had not above Two thouſand men, having left the reſt to guard <hi>Salerno</hi>; they were as proper men as the other, though not ſo well clad. They of <hi>Noce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> and <hi>La Cava</hi> which were between a thouſand and twelve hurdred men, though leſs fine, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more like Soldiers: They ſeemed indeed very couragious and reſolute, and had very fair and good Arms, every one of them carrying a Fire-Lock five Foot and a half long, and good Swords, which they knew how to uſe upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion I was very much ſatisfied in this review, and made no queſtion of being next day the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:57207:232"/>
Maſter of <hi>Naples.</hi> I ſent them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves, their Quarter being ready provided, and ordered them to be ſupplied with all things neceſſary. I returned to dine, and afterwards taking Horſe viſited all the Poſts, where I left in writing the Order of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque I intended to make next morning at break of day; having commanded all the Troops to march at Two after Midnight, and be ready to fall on, at the Signal I ſhould give by ringing all the Bells of the Town, eſpecially thoſe of St. <hi>Lawrence.</hi> I lodged at <hi>Marco de Lorenzo</hi>'s, to order all things in the Suburb of <hi>Chiaya,</hi> and to lie near the Pallace of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Gravina,</hi> where I intended to be before day.</p>
            <p>The Twelfth as ſoon as it was light, I made all the Bells be rung, and cauſed the Attacques to begin. <hi>Diego Paſſero</hi> advanc'd to the <hi>Corn-Office</hi> and entered it, but the Cannon of <hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Novo</hi> and the Haven cauſed him for want of earth to abandon it and retreat. <hi>Diego de So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riento</hi> with the <hi>Cavaioli,</hi> made himſelf Maſter of St. <hi>Bartholomeo,</hi> where the Italian Play-Houſe is, and keeping it till I ſounded a retreat, then fired it. They that made falſe Attaques, were ever engaged in a hot Skirmiſh, and gave all the diverſion and obtained all the effects I expected from them. <hi>Pouca</hi> attacqued St. <hi>Clare</hi> but faintly, and meeting ſome little reſiſtance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated without doing any thing. <hi>John Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> did not much better at <hi>Dona Alvina,</hi> and all that paſſed was a very eaſie skirmiſh. <hi>Mellone</hi>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:57207:233"/>
(who betraied us) would not make himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Santa Maria la Nova,</hi> which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards diſcouraged began to abandon. <hi>Polito Paſtena</hi> having ſtormed the firſt Entrenchment of Mount <hi>Oliveto,</hi> kept it not, his men taking a fright; and his Lieutenant, after poſſeſsing himſelf of an adjoyning Poſt, being too much advanced and not ſeconded, was taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, wounded by a Musket ſhot in the leg, of which he died three dayes after. The Turks did well, but ſeeing themſelves abandoned, and that <hi>Hannibal Brancaccio</hi> for want either of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience or courage retreated, were forced to do the like. <hi>Mattheo d' Amore, Carlo Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardo,</hi> and <hi>Onoffrio Piſacani</hi> cauſed their Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be fixed, four of which overcharged, broke under the weight, being too weak, as the other were too ſhort; ſo that their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good intentions became uſeleſs. Don <hi>Bernardino Caſtro Cucco</hi> took in a Half-Moon of Caſtle St. <hi>Elmo,</hi> on that ſide that is towards <hi>Chiaya. Diego Peres</hi> was Maſter of <hi>Santa Maria Parede</hi> and St. <hi>Charles,</hi> and going about to cauſe the Banditi of <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, they caſt themſelves on their Bellies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a Wall, whither I ſent the Knight <hi>de Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> to cauſe them to march; who gave them a hundred blows with his Cane, not ſparing the Officers; yet could by no means make them ſtand up. <hi>Alexio</hi> took <hi>Gli Angeli,</hi> which a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick fear cauſed him afterwards to abandon. The Baron <hi>Durand,</hi> the Sieurs <hi>Glandevez</hi> and <hi>de Villepreux</hi> took a Pallace defended by Germans,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:57207:233"/>
and were all three hurt; <hi>Villepreux</hi> under the Eye by a ſhiver of a Window, <hi>Glandevez</hi> by a Musket through his Thigh, and <hi>Durand</hi> in the Leg; they yet brought me two or three Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
            <p>All this while I did my uttermoſt for refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my attacques, and cauſing the Troops that were to ſecond them to advance, and ſending the Knight <hi>de Fourbin</hi> to cauſe <hi>Titus de Fuſco</hi> to march, it was impoſſible for him to oblige him to it; <hi>Fuſco</hi> laying the fault on his Captains, they on their Alfieres's, and the Alfiereses on the Serjeants, and was fain to drag all the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers one by one to poſſeſs a Pallace the Enemy had abandoned. Caſtle St. <hi>Elmo</hi> all this while continually ſhot at the Terraſs, where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my could diſcern me giving Orders. They killed ſome near me, at which vexed, I drew out Three hundred men to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Out-works; which were preſently carried, and my men advanced as far as St. <hi>Martins</hi> Cloiſter, and lodged themſelves there. The Spaniards became ſo tired by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reſiſtance in ſo many places, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan every where to give ground; when they were re-encouraged by the coming in of a great ſuccor of ſuch as defended the Poſts of the Town; <hi>Mellone, Polito Paſtena,</hi> and the other Officers being gone off either as Traitors or as Cowards: <hi>Batteville</hi> preſently made towards us with the Reformado Officers and a Body of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, to retake the Poſts we were poſſeſt of, without which they had been abſolutely loſt;
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:57207:234"/>
becauſe we had cut off their Correſpondence with Caſtle St. <hi>Elmo,</hi> and were Maſters of all their Quarters, coming on the backs of the Poſts they had advanced towards the Town. The Fight began to be hotter and more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and <hi>Diego Peres</hi> was ſhot with a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket through the Neck, and being brought to me, I cauſed him to be dreſt in my preſence, and the Bullet to be taken out, which was only covered by a thin skin on the ſide where it had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ceriſantes</hi> came to me ſmiling, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much ſatisfied that I had not the ſucceſs I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; ſaid, you have no good Officers, and will do nothing without me: I will bring all into order, and certainly ſtorm the Works the Enemies yet defend. I anſwered him angerly that he ſhould conſider that men that boaſt like him, and have ſo great a contempt for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ought either to make good their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or die. He inſtantly went on, and either his heat or ſome other preſsing neceſsity enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to put down his Breeches behind a Wall, a Musket Bullet carried away his great toe; which gangrening, he died three dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and that his vanity might continue to the laſt, he made a Will and me his Executor, leaving in Legacies and to Pious Uſes above Twenty five thouſand Crowns, though he was not worth a Cardecu in all the world.</p>
            <p>Our affairs were not yet in ſo bad a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but if <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> had marched with his men, and but made a ſhew of ſeconding the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:57207:234"/>
attacques, the Spaniards had abandoned all and retired to <hi>Caſtello Novo,</hi> and the Poſt of <hi>Pitzo Falcone</hi> there to have capitulated, as they ſince acknowledged to me. I ſent him Order for this by the Sieur <hi>de la Bottelerie</hi> one of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutants; but inſtead of it, he fell upon the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of <hi>Chiaye,</hi> and eſpecially on that of the Prince of <hi>Monteſarchio,</hi> which his Banditi be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to plunder; and being told that I would not ſuffer ſuch a diſorder, but would come in perſon to remedy it, he inſolently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he brought not his men to fight, but to plunder <hi>Naples</hi>; of which if the Duke came to hinder him, he would cauſe his Head to be cut off, and putting it in a Baſon, ſend it as a Preſent to Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Mad at ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent an Anſwer, I could not forbear to ſay that four and twenty hours ſhould make appear whoſe Head ſtood faſter on its ſhoulders, his or mine. I was ſorry for this raſhneſs, judging it fit for me yet to diſſemble with him; and at the ſame time hearing that <hi>Polito Paſtena</hi>'s Banditi committed diſorders in the Town, plundering all where they came, I cauſed a retreat to be ſounded: after a very obſtinate fight for the ſpace of three hours, wherein yet there were not Three hundred men killed or hurt on both ſides, the Adjutant of the Regiment of <hi>Diego Peres</hi> being taken priſoner, they pretended to hang him; but I ſent them word I would do the like with the Adjutant of Colonel <hi>Cicio Poderico,</hi> that we had taken, and they were exchanged three dayes after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:57207:235"/>The Baron of <hi>Modene</hi>'s ill fortune would ſo have it, that not having followed me, <hi>Auguſtin de Lieto,</hi> in order to what I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, told me he had learned that he had in that time viſited <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> and <hi>Gennaro</hi>; this gave me a jealouſie that was increaſed by the arrival of Father <hi>Capece</hi> and Cavalier <hi>Michelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> who rallying my misfortune, told me laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you ſee what it is to want the Baron of <hi>Modene,</hi> without whom you can do nothing conſiderable, as the People perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I turned my back to them without any Anſwer, reſerving my reſentments for a better occaſion. I then ſent Order to <hi>Polito Paſtena</hi> to draw his Banditi out of the Town, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them in St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Suburbs, and to return to <hi>Salerno</hi> next morning at day break. He went immediately away, without ſaying any thing, and left <hi>Gennaro</hi> ſixty of his Banditi to ſecure him, and undertake what he ſhould pleaſe to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. All went about to perſwade me that the People looking upon me to be reſponſible for this bad ſucceſs, my life was in danger; and that I ought not to return to <hi>Naples</hi>: I ſlighted thoſe vain terrors, reſolved to return as I did that Evening; and to make it believed that I had a conſiderable deſign to execute that Night, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all that could carry Arms to be at Eight a Clock in the <hi>Piazza</hi> before my Pallace and in in the Street of <hi>Saint John de Carbonara.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> in the mean time came to me to the Pallace of <hi>Gravina</hi> with extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, and told me that his men not being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:57207:235"/>
to fight in a Town, he reſolved to lead them again into the Field, to conquer <hi>Apulia</hi> and all the reſt of the Kingdom; and to this purpoſe demanded a Patent as Vicar General, with power to give Commiſſions to general Officers, Governors of Towns and Provinces, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all Confiſcations of the Goods of the Nobility. I told him he ſhould have it with all my heart, and that he ſhould go home with me, that I might diſpatch what he deſired; and to prevent his mens diſorders in the City, that he ſhould ſend them into the Suburbs, where they had quartered the Night before, to be in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for their March in the Morning. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to obey me, and taking Horſe I returned to <hi>Naples,</hi> where I was received by the People of both Sexes, with greater Acclamations and more Teſtimonies of Reſpect and Affection than formerly, Lights being placed every where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Paſſage; all crying out that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood very well that I had been betrayed, that I was to be careful of my ſafety, and cauſe Traitors to be ſeverely puniſhed. Perceiving by this that nothing could loſe me the Peoples good Opinion, my diſcontent ceaſed, and my hopes augmented; but looking upon my ſelf as ſtill in extream danger, I thought I was to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by addreſs to free my ſelf from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> the mean while inſtead of ſending his men to refreſh, kept them ſtill in Arms, and poſted them in the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places of the Town, himſelf having a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference two hours together with <hi>Vincenzo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea</hi>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:57207:236"/>
and <hi>Gennaro.</hi> Coming to my Pallace, I found all the World alarmed, as well <hi>Lazares</hi> as <hi>Black Clokes,</hi> at the Orders I had indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to every Body to take Arms; repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, that whatſoever my Enterpriſe were, if I brought them to engage in the Night, their animoſities againſt each other conſidered, it was to be apprehended that they would fall foul one of another; and theſe two parties coming to blows, which might infallibly happen, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy would eaſily prevail over both. I ſeemed to yield to their reaſons, and extreamly to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that by too great a complacency for them, I loſt the handſomeſt and moſt infallible Deſign I could ever undertake; that when I cauſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to be ſounded, it was not out of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of the cowardiſe or infidelity of my men, but upon advice that at Midnight two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Poſts would be put into my hands, which would eaſily make me Maſter of the whole City, the Enemies being weakned by their wants, and ſo tired with the fight of the day, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning themſelves to ſleep all Night, they would not be able to take Arms. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, they perſiſting in their Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I ſuffered them all to go to their ſeveral Quarters, with Order to continue all Night armed, to reſiſt the <hi>Banditi</hi>; who intended ſome diſorder, and perhaps to plunder the Town. I kept no more of my Guards about me than the number that were alwayes accuſtomed to paſs the Night in my Hall.</p>

               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:57207:236"/>As theſe things paſſed, two Deputies of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> came to demand Juſtice of me for the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their Town by <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Capitulations, without obſervance of any of the Articles I had granted them, when they ſo franckly rendred themſelves; believing I could do them Juſtice, now I had him with me. A Woman alſo caſt her ſelf at my feet, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that taking a liking to her Daughter of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſixteen years of age, and one of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Town, whom he ſaw as he paſſed by her door, he had ſent fifteen or ſixteen of his men, who took her away by force, and brought her to his Lodging, that he might raviſh her. I told her her Daughters honours was ſafe enough, if all its danger were on his ſide; that ſhe ſhould content her ſelf and go home, and be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to come to me as ſoon as I ſhould ſend for her. I ſaid the ſame to the two Deputies of <hi>Nola,</hi> and going into my Cabinet writ three Notes, one to the Auditor General, to go to the Vicary with a Confeſſor and the Hangman to execute what I ſhould command him; two others to <hi>Onoffrio Piſacani</hi> and <hi>Carlo Longobardo,</hi> with Order to be both of them with Fifty Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers of each of their Companies and two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans, at the Back-Door of the Garden of my Pallace; where they ſhould receive farther Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>By this time <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> was come to me with Six hundred of his beſt men, of whom he left Three hundred to be Maſters of the <hi>Corps de Garde</hi> at my Gate, Two hundred to poſſeſs
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:57207:237"/>
the Court of my Pallace and the Stair-foot, and a Hundred in my Guard-Chamber, that had every one of them Six Fire-Arms. One of my Servants came to me very much alarmed (as ſuppoſing me loſt) to give me notice. I ſmiled and told him it was the beſt News he could have brought me, then calling the Captain of my Guards, and giving him his Orders, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him with twelve of his men to poſſeſs the foot of a private Stair, by which was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from my Cabinet to my Secretaries Office, and to make a ſign to me of the arrival of <hi>Piſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani</hi> and <hi>Longobardo</hi> at the place I had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> came into my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, followed only by his Coſin <hi>Titus de Fuſco,</hi> whom he would have his Camp-Maſter General, and accoſting me with a ſmile, demanded all the favours already mentioned, adding the Confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Eſtate of the Prince of <hi>Avellina,</hi> whoſe Tenant he was born, and whoſe Title he deſired to take upon him. I told him I admired his modeſty, that would be ſatisfied ſo eaſily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo important ſervices as he had rendered me; that I had ſuch eſteem and affection for him, that I could refuſe him nothing; that I would diſpatch for him all he deſired, and in ſuch form as he beſt liked, at which he ſeemed to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well contented; within himſelf attributing all theſe obliging words to exceſs of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he had given me. <hi>Auguſtino de Lieto</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſign to me that all that I had ordered was in readineſs, I told <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> that to the end his Commiſſions might be to his mind, it
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57207:237"/>
would be beſt that he went and dictated them himſelf; and calling <hi>Inocentio</hi> the Chief Clerk of <hi>Hieronimo Fabrani</hi> my Secretary, I commanded him to give Order that <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> ſhould be obeyed as my ſelf, and all that he deſired di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched for him, in ſuch form as was moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to him. <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that all went ſo well to his mind, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by <hi>Titus de Fuſco</hi> his Coſin, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Captain of my Guard, went down towards my Secretaries Office, but as ſoon as they were at the Stair-foot, the Guards that waited for them, laid hold upon them, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Daggers at their Breſts, threatned that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt noiſe they would kill them. They begged they might not be put to death without Confeſſion, and were anſwered that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I ordered were not ſo ſudden, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the formalities of Juſtice. They ſuffered themſelves to be led away without any reſiſtance or words to the Back-Door of my Pallace; where they were put into two Sedans that ſtood ready for them, and carried to the Vicary, guarded by a hundred Musketiers appointed for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I ſent immediately to the Woman whoſe Daughter he had forced from her, and to the two Deputies of <hi>Nola,</hi> to go to the Vicary to depoſe againſt him. As ſoon as he and his Coſin came thither, the Auditor General cauſing them to be ſtript, in order to their being put on the Rack, they caſt themſelves on their Knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, begging they might not be tormented,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:57207:238"/>
and confeſſed more Crimes than were ſufficient to hang a hundred men. At the appearing of the Woman, he confeſſed he had forced away her Daughter, who was ſtill at his Quarter, but that no violence had as yet been uſed toward her, having deferred it till his return from my Pallace. At the appearance of the two Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Nola,</hi> he acknowledged he had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their Capitulations, and had plundered their Town. His Coſin being found to have a ſhare in all his miſchiefs, and confeſſing them in like manner with him, they were both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die, and delivered to two Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; after which expecting Execution, they were ſurpriſed to ſee themſelves expoſed to the Torture ordinary and extraordinary which I cauſed to be given them. Amongſt the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they confeſſed, that they came to <hi>Naples</hi> only to plunder it, and not to ſtorm the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Poſts, not deſirous to ſee ſo ſudden an end of the Kingdoms diſorders; that when they threatned to cut off my Head and carry it to Don <hi>John,</hi> they really intended it, in caſe I went about to hinder them from plundering, expecting a very conſiderable reward from the Spaniards for ſuch a Preſent; that they thought by ſuch a menace to have terrified me in ſuch a manner, that I ſhould have refuſed none of their Demands; that the Authority of Vicar General, to which he had pretended, would have given him opportunity to have ſecurely drawn to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the money of all the Provinces, and the ſack of all the Kingdom: after which my Head ſhould
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57207:238"/>
(at his pleaſure) have purchaſed his Pardon of the Spaniards, or elſe he would have retired with what he had gotten, to ſuch part of the World as ſeemed ſecureſt for him; that diſtruſt of my ſecuring his Perſon, prevented his ſending his men out of the Town as I had ordered; that he detained them, expreſly to terrifie me, and made himſelf Maſter of my Pallace, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel me to ſuch Condeſcenſions, as he knew I would never willingly yield to; that in caſe of refuſal he had reſolved to have ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me, of which he had agreed (before he came to me;) with <hi>Gennaro</hi> and <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo Andrea</hi>; that before the attacque of the Poſts he had ſent an Old Woman to Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to know what he would give for my Head.</p>
            <p>He afterwards confeſſed Crimes, Sacriledges, and Abominations ſo horrible, that the reading his Depoſitions amazed me. I cauſed him to be queſtioned about his plundering the Caſtle of <hi>Avellina,</hi> cauſed an Inventory to be made of all he had taken thence, and the names of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to which he had tranſported it, and where he had beſtowed that which in the Morning he had taken out of the Pallace of the Prince <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſarchio,</hi> and other adjoyning Houſes; which he confeſſed was at his Quarter to be packed up and carried away next Morning, with all elſe that was good in the Town, which he owned he intended to have plundered before his departure. The Auditor General perceiving no more could be drawn from him, cauſed him to
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:57207:239"/>
die, with his Coſin, and preſently ſent me word of it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving asked my leave to return to the Army, I bid him have a little patience, and I would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch him at Night. And <hi>Antonio de Calco, Marco Piſano,</hi> and <hi>Andrea Rama,</hi> having been deputed by the Garriſon of <hi>Averſa,</hi> to deſire me to ſend them back their Camp-Maſter Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in whoſe place no other would be pleaſing to them, the Sieur <hi>de Mallet</hi> commanding du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his abſence. I told them I would do reaſon to their demand, but that they ſhould expect a while; that I had extraordinary News to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with, which was that I had ſecured <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> and afterwards cut off his Head, demanding their Opinions, and whether they did not believe I had done well? They anſwered yes, but looking upon one another ſeemed very much ſurpriſed. Cauſing a Servant to take two Lights, I went into the Hall, demanding of all I found there, what their buſineſs was ſo late? They told me, they waited for their General. I told them that muſt be whomſever I ſhould ſet over them; becauſe I had cut off the Head of <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> for the many Crimes he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and they not being much better, ought to apprehend the like puniſhment; but that if they would promiſe me to change their manner of life, and become better, I would willingly pardon them, and cheriſh them as a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does his Children. They fell all on their Knees, and beſought my pardon; after which
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:57207:239"/>
I commanded them to retire, and let their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions know, that not one of them ſhould be in the Town next Morning at Eight a Clock, on peril of their lives; and that they took care they carried not the leaſt plunder away with them. All this was ſo punctually obſerved, that they left behind them all that they had taken, which I cauſed to be rendered to the Owners, after it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to whom every thing belonged. I ſent then two of my Guards to reconduct the Maid that had been forced away, to her Mother; no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence having been acted againſt her.</p>
            <p>The Captain of my Guards had cauſed a great many Sedans to be brought to my Stair-head, as I had ordered, and going into my Cabinet, I told the Baron of <hi>Modene,</hi> and thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him, that it was too late to diſpatch them, that they ſhould therefore return in the Morning; that I had done enough that day to oblige me to go to reſt. As he paſſed through my Hall, he was arreſted by the Lieutenant of my Guards, and <hi>Antonio de Calco, Marco Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſano, Andrea Rama,</hi> Cavalier <hi>Michellini,</hi> the Sieur <hi>Deſinare,</hi> and his Secretary, by other of my Officers; and carried all Priſoners to the Vicary. I writ a Note to Cardinal <hi>Filomarini</hi> to acquaint him, that having cauſed my Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Father <hi>Capece,</hi> a man turbulent and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to be arreſted, I ſent him to his Priſon, that I might in nothing encroach upon Eccleſiaſtical Juſtice; deſiring he might be kept cloſe priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without converſing with any. Finding the Confeſſor in my Chamber, I made him a relation
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:57207:240"/>
of all that had paſſed. He was very much ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when he heard the Baron of <hi>Modene</hi> was Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, told him he needed not think it ſo ſtrange ſince himſelf was partly the cauſe. He went about to juſtifie himſelf by plauſible diſcourſes, which I interrupted and reſerved to the next day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great deſire as well as great need to go to bed. As he went out of my Hall at the Stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head the Captain of my Guards ſecured him, (at which he was much ſurpriſed) and putting him into a Sedan, ſent him to the Priſon of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick, accompanied by the Enſigne of my Guards, with the Note I had written to Cardinal <hi>Filomarini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ended the day of the attacque of the Poſts, which I may ſay was very great and very extraordinary, not ſo much for what happened on it, as what followed, my eſcaping by my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and addreſs ſo many different dangers, and my ſo boldly and ſubtilly making my ſelf Maſter of a man, that thought my fortune and life in his hands.</p>
            <p>Next morning the heads of thoſe that had been executed were ſet upon the Poſt in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, and each of their bodies hung by one foot, with an inſcription importing, That they had been convicted of Murthers, Sacriledges, Rapes, and burning houſes; of correſpondence with the Enemy, and attempts on my perſon: that they had broken the Capitulation made with the City of <hi>Nola,</hi> refuſed to fight out of cowardize, and deſigned to plunder <hi>Naples.</hi> Their Treaſon publiſhed, the people ran in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:57207:240"/>
to ſee them, ſo abominating them, that they could hardly be hindred from tearing their bodies in pieces. And as I returned from Maſs over the Market-place, I received a thouſand Benedictions, the people kiſſing my feet, and making (if it were poſſible) greater teſtimonies than uſual of reſpect and affection: ſo that by means of this unlucky ranconter, and of our ill ſucceſs in the attacque of the Poſts, I ſaw my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority increaſed, with greater affection for me, and more hatred of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This may make appear how great my fortune was, ſince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my misfortunes proved advantageous to me.</p>
            <p>I next of all ſent away the Auditor General to take information of the waſte of the Corn of <hi>Averſa,</hi> and the ill comportment of the Officers; and it being neceſſary that its government ſhould be provided for, I gave it to <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> on pretence of confidence in him, to abſent him from <hi>Naples,</hi> where his negotiations with the Enemy gave me jealouſie, and place him where he could do me no hurt, and where I could cauſe his comportment to be more narrowly obſerved, leaving him only a ſhadow of authority. I gave <hi>Calco</hi>'s Regiment to the Sieur <hi>de Beauvais</hi> a French Gentleman; and to <hi>St. Maximin</hi> (afterwards Quarter-maſter of my Guard) a gallant Soldier, and very faithful, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the ſame Body, and two others to two other Frenchmen: leaving this Regiment, which I made up eight hundred men, in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there. I cauſed all the reſt of the Troops to march out, whom, under command of the Sieur
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:57207:241"/>
               <hi>de Mallet,</hi> in quality of Serjeant Major General of the Army, I ſent to <hi>St. Maries</hi> a league from <hi>Capua.</hi> I ſent <hi>de Fargis</hi> with a ſufficient Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to <hi>Caiaſſa,</hi> having on the other ſide of it <hi>Marchianeſe</hi> and <hi>Luſicano,</hi> which I had fortified with the Tower of <hi>Patria,</hi> expecting only the arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Gallies to make my ſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Caſtle Vulturno,</hi> which though not very ſtrong, being ſeated at the mouth of the river, might be relieved by Sea: but I cauſed continual cruiſings to be made, to hinder the paſſage of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, which might eaſily by ſea be tranſported to the Enemies from <hi>Capua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> wants increaſed daily, getting no ſubſiſtance but what was brought them from <hi>Caſtelamare</hi> by their Gallies, who could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes paſs by reaſon of ill weather, and were ſometimes a fortnight ere they returned, which reduced the Caſtles and Quarters of the Enemy to the utmoſt extremity: and when the weather was fair, the Gallies were ſo ill manned, that cauſing them to be followed by Brigantins and Fellucca's with Soldiers, they made no voyage without great hazard, being forced to make uſe of the Citizens (for the moſt part uſeleſs) inſtead of Souldiers: they therefore preſſed their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents to an attempt on my perſon, it being the only way left for their preſervation.</p>
            <p>The Nobility was in the mean time very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, ſome of them having poſſeſſed themſelves of Towns, and the enmity between the Duke of <hi>Martina</hi> and Earl of <hi>Converſano,</hi> rendring them uſeleſs, moſt adhering to the latter, they buſied
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:57207:241"/>
themſelves only to oppoſe one another, inſtead of application to their common intereſt: but their jealouſies, which increaſed every day, were attributed to my ſecret correſpondencies, and it was thought that thoſe that retired to fortified places, or raiſed forces, did it that they might make more advantageous conditions with me, in which perhaps men were not very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after the attacque of the Poſts I went attended only by my Gards and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques to give God thanks at our Lady <hi>de l' Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> a place of great devotion, to ſee the miſchief had been done by the laſt eruption of <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> and to conſider the miracle of the deluge of flames came from it, and made towards the Sea, which ſeparating rejoyned after having left that little Chappel, as if in an Iſle, though the natural channel, formed by the manner of the hils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, muſt needs have ruined and carried it away. At my return I went to refreſh my ſelf at the houſe of <hi>Caſpero de Romero,</hi> whoſe Garden is the moſt delightful of thoſe parts. <hi>Gennaro</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was there, came preſently thither with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to kill me, followed by a hundred and twenty Banditi; but whether it were that my time was not yet come, or that he wanted reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for ſo bold an attempt, I happily ſecured my ſelf, and he with no leſs fortune avoided the ſnares I had laid for him, which according to probability was impoſſible. I diſcovered him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way at a great diſtance, and left but few of my Gards without the Gate, placing all the reſt
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:57207:242"/>
within the Court, where they appeared not, I ſent the Captain of my Guards to receive him, who having brought him into the houſe, cauſed the door to be ſhut, not ſuffering above three or four to enter with him. In the mean time I ſent order to <hi>Onoffrio Piſſacani</hi> and <hi>Carlo Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardo</hi> with their Companies to poſſeſs St. <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalenes</hi> Bridge, by which probably he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Theſe were men I confided in, and his enemies, and of the greateſt credit in the Town, that might have killed him without danger, or any diſtruſt that it was on my account, but only becauſe of his correſpondence with the Enemy. There was another way by which he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Town by the Gate of <hi>Capua,</hi> where by my order <hi>Mattheo d'Amore,</hi> and <hi>Cicio Batimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ello</hi> expected him with their Companies to the ſame purpoſe. I led him round the Garden, and then going with him to a Terrace on the top of the houſe, where there is the moſt agreeable proſpect of the world, he became pale and very much ſurpriſed to find himſelf ſo ſlightly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied amongſt thirty Centlemen that belonged to me, and as I conceived repented to have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded himſelf ſo lightly. Seeing thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him with their arms in their hands, I told him they ought not to be in that poſture in preſence of my Guards, and that he ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to lay down their arms and go off; the fear that poſſeſſed him making him very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, he called to them to do the one and the other, which was immediately performed. All that belonged to me, ſucceſſively asked me if
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:57207:242"/>
they ſhould kill him or caſt him off of the Terraſs, which had been performed at the leaſt ſign I could have given. I poſitively forbad this, and out of two conſiderations. The firſt that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very apparent that I was the Author of his death, the Kings Miniſters perſwaded of his good intentions to ſerve the Crown, and believing he loſt his life on that account, and that I ſacrificed him to my ambition, would have taken occaſion to have done me bad offices, hinder the return of the Fleet, and ſuccors. The other that I had not confidence enough in the courage of my Guards, for a hundred and twenty Banditi appearing, and he perhaps having more which I had not diſcovered, the hazard would have been too great; believing it might bee done more privately, and that his death would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible at his return. After two hours diſcourſe, which as much as poſſible he could, he ſought to abbreviate, and I to prolong, that ſuch as I had ſent to way-lay him might certainly be arrived, we parted; he took horſe very glad to be out of my hands, and reſolved (as he afterwards made apparent) never to truſt himſelf in them again. Being very unreſolved what way to paſs, at laſt riding round about a great Marſh, he reentred <hi>Naples</hi> by the Gate of <hi>Nola.</hi> After my diſcovery of this I had not time enough to ſend to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him; and in this manner both he and I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of our deſign. Sending before to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whether any ambuſcade were in my way, I returned home by the Bridge of <hi>la Magdalena,</hi> where I found <hi>Piſſacani</hi> and <hi>Longobardo</hi> mad to
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:57207:243"/>
have loſt ſo handſome an occaſion, which we muſt with incertainty wait for another time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> came to me in the Evening to tell me that their time being expired, a new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection was to be made of Captains of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that it was of very great importance to make a good choice; I anſwered him, That by the Capitulations made with the Duke of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos,</hi> the nomination belonged to the People, and reſolved not to infringe any of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, I reſerved to my ſelf only the right of excluding ſuch as I had cauſe to ſuſpect. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that it belonged to me alone to make the choice, and that in the morning he would bring me three Breviates of the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> by which I might evince he had done the like, after he had ſigned the Articles that left this to the People. I appointed all thoſe I confided in, to bring me the Names of all the Pretenders, that we might carefully examine who were moſt proper for us. He failed not to preſent me in the morning the three Breviates he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and employed all the reſt of the day in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Cabals and incenſing all men againſt me, by repreſenting to them that I played the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and uſurping an abſolute Authority, acted as a Soveraign, without any conſideration of the Peoples advantages; depriving them even of thoſe the Spaniards had allowed them: he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by this means to have cauſed me to have been ſlain in a Commotion, not doubting but the Breviates he had delivered me, would have incited me to a Conteſtation that my Authority
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:57207:243"/>
ought not to be leſs than that of a Viceroy. In the Evening having cauſed a great many People to draw together in the Piazza before my Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, he came to me at the head of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, having caſt off his diſguiſe, to declare himſelf; but I had luckily ſuch friends about me, as were not ſuſpected, who having greater cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit than he, did me good ſervice on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He told me, that the People very much admired that I made Captains of the Quarters on my own Authority, the Election belonging to them; that nothing could more highly offend them than to deprive them of a Priviledge for whoſe preſervation they had taken Arms; that I ought to conſider well, that this deſtroyed the Cities liberty inſtead of reſtoring it; making me appear rather its Tyrant than Protector. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſcovered his deſign, becauſe if I fell from what I had pretended, the thanks would have been his, and perſiſting, he hoped to have cauſed me to have been ſlain by the People. I anſwered him calmly, that I could not have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined his malice ſo black, nor his impudence ſo great; that he ought to recollect, that when he ſpoke to me of this affair, I told him I would meddle no farther in it but to exclude ſuch as we confided not in, and that inſtead of leſſening the Peoples Priviledges I pretended to augment them, daily hazarding my life for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and liberty of <hi>Naples</hi>; ſo far I was from thought of oppreſsing it: that he ſhould recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that he had told me of how great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it was that I made the Choice of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

of the Quarters, to avoid the diſorder and misfortune that might follow, if any amongſt them ſhould be ill affected or hold Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Enemy; and that to let me ſee that none could juſtly take offence at my making the Nomination after the example of the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> whoſe power was not equal to mine, he himſelf had brought me three Breviates, which (taking out of a Book where I expreſly kept them in readineſs) I ſhewed to all the World; which was by it ſufficiently convinced, as well of his malice as my innocence. All that were affected to me, began to cry out, That it was very hard that I ſhould be ſuſpected and calumniated without cauſe; that the People ought to look upon me as their Father, being ſo tenderly affected towards them, and daily expoſing my ſelf to ſo many dangers on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half to procure them liberty and quiet; that they could not therefore have too great reſpect or compliance for me: to this there was the general aſſent of all that were preſent. <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo Andrea</hi> perceiving matters went not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his expectation, craftily diſſembling, told me, He had delivered the words he had been encharged with, but that never having had the leaſt diſtruſt of my proceedings, he intended to have publiſhed my Conduct to the People, and their Obligation to me, for leaving that to them, which I might with ſo much reaſon have pretended to, by the example of the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> his Breviates, which he himſelf had brought to me I replied, That I was moſt

               </gap>enſibly obliged to him on two accounts, the firſt for having given me opportunity to ſatisfie the publick of the ſincerity of my proceedings; the ſecond, that he had diſcovered his ſubtilties, which I freely pardoned; but that I aſſured him I would another time ſtand better on my Guard, and uſe greater precaution, when he propounded any thing to me, or when I had any affair to treat with him about.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I beſought thoſe that were aſſembled, ſince they were a number capable of proceeding to the Election, to do it in my preſence, that I might (at leaſt) give my ſenſe for the excluſion of ſuch perſons as I ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſpect or diſlike. They all made proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they preſented me their Votes, and beſought me to nominate ſuch as beſt pleaſed me, with aſſurance that they would all ſubmit to it. I thought good to make a civil uſe of their reſpect, and taking a Liſt of the Pretenders, read all the Names<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and (the Friends I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand prepared, excepting againſt all ſuch as they knew I diſliked) writ before them ſuch as had a general approbation, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well ſatisfied with the Election. Then I took out of my Pocket my own Liſt of ſuch perſons as I thought fitteſt for us, and reading it to them, they found it agreed with the choice they themſelves had made. On this occaſion I expreſſed a great deal of joy, that all our intentions were ſo good, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by their being ſo conformable. I put the Liſt into their hands, that they might cauſe
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:57207:245"/>
an Act of the Nomination to be drawn up in the uſual Forms; and at parting deſired them all (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in his Quarter) to let the People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the manner of my proceeding, and the cauſe they had to approve my Conduct.</p>
            <p>This malicious ſubtilty of <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> inſtead of ruining, having augmented my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and loſt him his; he was afterwards as much diſtruſted by all the World as he had juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been by me. Remorſe of Conſcience gave him ever after continual apprehenſions. He durſt no longer go abroad in the Evenings, nor eat nor drink in my Pallace, as he formerly uſed to do, equally fearing Sword and Poyſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible that he deſerved death in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſoever it might be given him. He never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſpoke of buſineſs to me but in publick, and (when poſſible) out of my Pallace, we being equally cautious of each other, and each of us deſigning to prevent the other.</p>
            <p>Next day about Noon the Citizens complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that the Butchers, contrary to my Proclamation, kept Arms on their Stalls whileſt they ſold their meat; affronting the inhabitants, and cauſing them by force to take that which they deſired to be rid of, in ſuch quantities and at ſuch price as they pleaſed. I preſently ſent and ſecured one, who having committed more inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies than the reſt, had not only given ill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but ſtruck a Tradeſman that had refuſed to buy ſomething that pleaſed him not, or that he thought tainted. The reſt of the Butchers mutinied and took Arms, of which having
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:57207:245"/>
notice, I ſent <hi>Mattheo d' Amore</hi> with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to poſſeſs himſelf of one of the Streets that went to the Shambles, and <hi>Onoffrio Piſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani</hi> and <hi>Carlo Longobardo</hi> with Two hundred Musketiers of the other. I preſently went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther followed by my Guards, and cauſed Six-ſcore Butchers to be diſarmed, and tied two and two, and in that poſture led through all the Town, ſwearing that if I hanged not all of them, the tenth man at leaſt ſhould become an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Their Wives came and caſt themſelves at my feet to beg their pardons, which I a great while refuſed, but at laſt condiſcended that none but he that had committed the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence ſhould die: but I was moved by the tears of his Wife and five or ſix little Children, who begging only his life, and that I ſhould cauſe him to be puniſhed in ſuch manner as I thought fit; I contented my ſelf to have him whipped about the Streets, followed by all his Companions tied two and two as I already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. His Family gave me thanks as for the greateſt Clemency I could have uſed, and this exemplary puniſhment had ſuch an effect, that after it none had ever the inſolence to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my Edicts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> ſtill contriving my ruin, made uſe of an artifice, againſt which he thought it impoſſible for me to ſecure my ſelf. He came to me accompanied by the Prince of <hi>La Rocca</hi> a Coſin of Cardinal <hi>Filomarini,</hi> moſt paſſionate for the intereſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſerve which he never neglected any occaſion. He
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:57207:246"/>
was that year <hi>Graſſiero,</hi> which is an imployment that gives him authority over all that concerns Victuals, and is exerciſed every year alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively by a Gentleman and Gownman. They told me great abuſes were committed by the inhabitants of the Villages about <hi>Naples,</hi> who every day brought plenty of Bread to ſell; but held it at ſo high rates that the people ſtarved. They told me this muſt neceſſarily be moderated, or the Town could not ſubſiſt. I quickly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how malicious this Propoſal was, becauſe by refuſing a Regulation I ſhould incur the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hatred, and if I ordered it, no more Bread would be brought from the Countrey. I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to diſcover the malice, and bid them draw up a Proclamation, which I would publiſh. This having been done, no more Bread came to Town; and the next day I was told that the rabble in all Streets cried out, <hi>Bread or Spain.</hi> I immediately took Horſe, and ſhewing my ſelf in all the Streets, my preſence cauſed this noiſe to ceaſe; and I promiſed them all that before night they ſhould have plenty, informing the People of the deſign to have famiſhed them: then ſending my Guards to all the Villages, I commanded the Countrey people to bring in all the Bread they could, which they ſhould ſell at their own prizes. Three hours after ſo great a quantity came in, that during all the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo much was never ſeen together. I had a thouſand benedictions from them all, which were redoubled by the expedient I found to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Breads being ſold too dear, which was
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:57207:246"/>
by forbidding any to be carried back; and that all day they might ſell it at as high rates as they could, but that all that remained at night ſhould be confiſcated. In this manner hope of profit made it come in from all parts, and the Citizens not being too haſty to buy, but ſtaying till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night, obliged thoſe that ſold it to take a reaſonable price. This Order ſucceeded ſo well, that I cauſed it to be obſerved ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Intending to viſit the Countrey, and fearing leaſt in the mean time the Spaniards, very well informed of what paſſed, ſhould make ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in my abſence, I ordered <hi>Onoffrio Piſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani, Carlo Lombardo, Cicio Battimiello,</hi> and <hi>Mattheo d' Amore,</hi> to make continual rounds through all the Poſts, to re inforce and ſecond ſuch as might be attacqued. The laſt of theſe going to the Gate of <hi>Medina,</hi> and finding the Enemy ſallying repelled him briskly, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging too far, and perceiving he was cut off, caſt himſelf and his Company into a ſtrong Houſe, in which he defended himſelf above two hours; but his powder failing, he found he could no longer reſiſt, and reſolving to die, refuſed Quarter: of which as ſoon as I had notice, reſolved to ſave ſo gallant and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a perſon, I commanded the Guard of my Pallace to run and diſ-ingage him; but I found no Officer to whom to give my Orders, the Captain being accidentally abſent: but Colonel <hi>Diego Peres</hi> (this being the firſt time of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming abroad after his hurt, which was not yet
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:57207:247"/>
healed) thinking I would not ſend him, out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his weakneſs, went down Stairs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying any thing to me; and taking his Sedan, cauſed himſelf to be carried thither; where his courage ſupplying his want of ſtrength, drawing his Sword, and creeping as well as he could, he not only diſ-ingaged <hi>Mattheo d' Amore,</hi> but ſtruck ſuch a terror in the Spaniards, that they abandoned all the Poſts they held on that ſide, he advancing to the Court of Guard of the Vice-Roys Pallace; which I could not have believed, had not the Spaniards themſelves acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to me in the time of my impriſonment. I ſaw then the return of two perſons that were very dear to me, and to whom I was obliged for their valour and zeal to my ſervice: I failed not (by careſſing them) to ſignifie the eſteem I held them in, and my joy, that Heaven had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them to me.</p>
            <p>I was very glad that Bread (though dear) was plentiful, but <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> would have deprived me of this ſatisfaction, by making it uſeleſs to me; and did his beſt that the money I had coined, by his advice might be no longer cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; a great deal of it having already paſſed, and being in the hands of poor people in a ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving condition. But this was eaſily remedied by a Proclamation that none ſhould refuſe it on pain of death. I was ſo abſolute and ſo much feared, that none durſt diſobey my Orders; they which did ſo, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remiſſion, immediately puniſhed. Thus his ill deſignes came ſhort of effect, and the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:57207:247"/>
miſchief was prevented almoſt before it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
            <p>There were no more diſorders heard of in the Town, no robberies, burnings of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor any other violences; but I ſatisfied not my ſelf with that which ſeemed ſo little to me, though any body elſe would have believed they had effected impoſſibilities; and I reſolved to re-eſtabliſh Juſtice, and make appear that I knew how to erect her Throne in the midſt of a Civil War, and the Noiſe of Arms. I aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſuch as had formerly been Judges or were perſons capable of it, and in two dayes ſettled the Exchequer, where I made <hi>John Camillo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racciol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Preſident, a man of great experience, and the fitteſt of all others for that Employment, and <hi>Franciſco de Pati</hi> to aſſiſt him, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the advice he had given me of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Abbot <hi>Baſqui</hi>; and appointed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers neceſſary for that Court. I reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Council of <hi>St. Clare,</hi> formed the Civil and Criminal Vicary, ordered the Judges to wear their Robes, and not fail daily to aſſemble at the Tribunals; and all buſineſſes of this nature were ſo carefully managed that more Law-Suits were decided and terminated in two moneths, than had been formerly diſpatched in ten years, and with ſo great equity and punctuality, that all Sentences and Decrees made during my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, were valid afterwards, without any pretence and leſs reaſon of appeal from them; which gained me ſo much eſteem, that as long as <hi>Naples</hi> ſtands, my memory will be honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:57207:248"/>
The ſame of this went through all <hi>Italy,</hi> cauſing admiration that in a time of ſo great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and a place of ſo much confuſion and diſorder, I could in ſuch a manner regulate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; of whoſe effects I quickly became ſenſible. But that which obliged the Judges to be ſo exact in their duty, was that every Wedneſday and Saturday I took an accompt of all their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and finding a Sentence defective or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputable, I cauſed a rehearing in my preſence, and none was put in execution till I had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and approved it. Twice I altered what they had done, and gave Sentence my ſelf with Soveraign Authority; which appeared to be ſo juſt and reaſonable, that none could object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what I had declared: which was put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution after my impriſonment.</p>
            <p>That I might get greater light of all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies practices, I ordered <hi>Auguſtino Mollo,</hi> and two or three of his friends, whom I could truſt, to ſend to deſire the Viceroys leave to accept the Charges I had given them; by this means aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the Enemies confidence in them, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them the more eaſily to give me good and certain intelligence: and in like manner, by my Order, they ſometimes acquainted him with my ſecret intentions, when they were ſuch as I thought it an advantage to me to diſcover them to him. This proved very uſeful, but cauſed the ſaid <hi>Mollo</hi> to be ſuſpected of Correſpondence, and made the People jealous of him: but I muſt needs give this Teſtimony of him, that no man in <hi>Naples</hi> ſerved me more faithfully; having
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:57207:248"/>
diſcovered two or three Conſpiracies againſt my life, and ſecured me from many dangers that without his counſel (which was ever ſucceſsful to me) I could not have avoided.</p>
            <p>The Nineteenth of <hi>February,</hi> the Spaniards received great mortification, and my ſelf and People extraordinary joy, by the arrival of Don <hi>John</hi> of St. <hi>Severine,</hi> Earl of <hi>La Saponara,</hi> and afterwards Prince of <hi>Beſignano,</hi> chief of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt and nobleſt Family of the Kingdom, and whoſe grandeur could not be ſuppreſt by the perſecution of many Kings; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> who cauſed two and twenty of it at once to be ſlain in the Caſtle of <hi>Laina,</hi> (whither they came on his Parole) incenſed by their having drawn into the Field in eight dayes Eighteen thouſand Foot, all of their Tenants, and in four and twenty hours Seven thouſand Horſe, by them to have ſecured themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his oppreſſion. As he paſſed over the Market-place, the People ran to kiſs his feet, and I received him with open arms; he brought me the beſt News imaginable, which was the general diſſatisfaction of all the Nobility, who expected only the example of ſome of the chief of their Order to follow it; and very few or none at all being comparable to him in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages either of Birth or Riches, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be the firſt in demonſtrating his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Countrey, by hazarding his life to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond my good intentions, and contribute to its repoſe and liberty. He told me he came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Orders, and obey them with as much
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:57207:249"/>
ſubmiſſion as fidelity; that his Family had been the laſt that followed the fortune of that of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> from which being well informed that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, he came to reverence in my Perſon the Blood of his ancient Kings; ſince whoſe time the Countrey had been ſo cruelly oppreſſed by Tyrants, whom he reſolved to ſuffer no longer; that perſons of his quality ought never to loſe occaſions of breaking their Fetters, when Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Fortune gives them means to do it; that the Spaniards had done all that tended to the Kingdoms deſtruction; that he abandoned them not, till they had abandoned themſelves; and that neither reaſon nor honour obliged the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to ſuffer themſelves to be involved in their ruin, ſince all things well conſidered, they were rather Uſurpers than lawful Maſters; that being well informed of the condition of their affairs, he perceived their ruin to be infallible, being in a general want of all things and no ſuccors to be from any part expected; that nothing was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful towards compleating ſo great an enterpriſe as mine, which I had carried on with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and good conduct; but (beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the French Fleet) the poſſeſsing my ſelf of one of the Caſtles of <hi>Naples,</hi> and then the Firſt of <hi>May,</hi> when the Nobility ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged from their Oath of Fidelity, by the Proteſtation they had made, they would moſt certainly declare with us, for which he could be reſponſible, by the certain knowledge he had of their intentions; and that then the ruin of the Spaniards was infallible: that beſides this
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:57207:249"/>
there was another way to the ſame end, more ſpeedy and no leſs ſafe, which was, that aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the Town I ſhould march into <hi>Apulia,</hi> the fitteſt place for a rendezvous, becauſe in the middle of the Kingdom; that as ſoon as I ſhould be there all the Nobility would come in to me, and place me at their head; that I ſhould then immediately raiſe a great Army, with which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Naples,</hi> I might at once deſtroy the Enemy there; that by this means I ſhould free the Nobility from diſtruſt, who, coming to me, would ſuppoſe they re-united themſelves with the People, whereas they deſired I ſhould owe my fortune to them alone; that apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fortified places of the Kingdom ought to give me no trouble, for they were entirely unprovided of all things neceſſary for defence; beſides that, there was not one of them, in which ſome Gentlemen had not intelligence and credit enough, to become Maſter: that I had nothing to do, but let a little time paſs, after which I ſhould neither want Money, Men, nor Proviſions; that on the Five and twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> the Cuſtom-Houſe of <hi>Foggia</hi> would pay me down in ready money Six hundred thouſand Crowns; that if I would make him Preſident of the two <hi>Calabria</hi>'s, he doubted not in leſs than three weeks to draw together Six thouſand Foot and Two thouſand Horſe, and to deliver me in Silk, Salt, and Oil, the value of more than a Million of Gold; that for Corn I ſhould find in <hi>Apulia</hi> and <hi>Baſilocata</hi> more than was neceſſary to ſupply the Town of <hi>Naples</hi> two years; and
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:57207:250"/>
that in a word he would be reſponſible for the Conqueſt of the Kingdome: that there needed only a little time and patience to ſee the effect of the Mines which were almoſt ready to be fired.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs his Diſcourſe charmed me, and that I uſed all endeavours to give him teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of my acknowledgements, and how much I thought my ſelf obliged to him. I told him his arrival aſſured me of the Nobilities declaring, whoſe intentions I never diſtruſted; though I ever thought ſuch an example as his neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ſuch as were yet irreſolute; that I doubted not to ſee him quickly followed by all perſons of quality that remained; that this was not the firſt time that the Family of St. <hi>Severine</hi> had influence over the whole Kingdome; that I ever held it in very great eſteem and Veneration, and ſhould be unworthy the Family of <hi>Anjou,</hi> from which I deſcended, if I had not an hereditary affection for it; that I was yet more engaged by his handſom manner of proceeding with me, for which I would never prove ungrateful; and that I would never pretend a fortune, but on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſharing with himſelf and friends, all its advantages; that I was well informed of the extremities the Spaniards were reduced to, whom I could no longer fear, and now I had him on my ſide, contemned; that aſſuring my ſelf of all he had told me, I (with pleaſure look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Conqueſt of the Kingdom, as in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perfected, and the deſign I had undertaken of giving it liberty as infallible, yet without any
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:57207:250"/>
other intereſt, than the glory to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed towards it with peril of my life, that ly I ſhould afterwards die with ſatisfaction, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing my memory would be eternal, I (by his aſsiſtance) becoming the moſt illuſtrious Perſon of my time; that I expected the return of the French Fleet with as much aſſurance as impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, after which the taking of the Caſtles and driving away the Enemy would be no longer a buſineſs; that my intention had ever been to have gone into <hi>Apulia,</hi> to aſſemble the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he had adviſed me, and would do it as ſoon as my Brother the Knight of <hi>Maltha</hi> ſhould arrive, whom I intended to leave in <hi>Naples,</hi> which I ſhould infallibly loſe if I abandoned it, though I valued it not but in regard of reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being certain to re-take it without difficulty, as ſoon as I ſhould appear before it followed by the Nobility; that with a very good will I gave him the Charge of Preſident of the two <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria</hi>'s, and what ever elſe he ſhould deſire of me, which was indeed only to preſent him what his own credit and declaration for me put me in a condition to diſpoſe of. He tarried but two dayes with me, ſo great was his impatience to bring to effect all the advantages he had given me hope of. He deſired ſome French men might go with him, and I gave him the Baron <hi>Durand</hi> and two or three others, with Don <hi>Carlo Gaeti</hi> (whom with the Dutcheſs his Wife I afterwards ſaw here) for Commiſſary General of his Horſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:57207:251"/>Whilſt he acts in <hi>Calabria,</hi> it will be beſt (not to interrupt the dependencies of my diſcourſe) to return to what paſſed with me in the mean time, and relate the order I ſent to the Sieur <hi>de Mallet,</hi> to poſt himſelf on the <hi>Voltorno,</hi> ſo to ſtreighten <hi>Capua,</hi> by cutting off its Navigation on this River, and Communication with the Sea. He ſent three hundred men towards <hi>Gracianiſa,</hi> to entrench themſelves on the River ſide, who diſlodged ſome Troops they found there, and <hi>Dom Lewis Poderico</hi> having made an ineffectual attempt upon him, returned with greater force, and cauſed ſome foot to fall on, which was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly beaten off: but having made a ſhew of retreating, he returned to the attacque an hour after; and for encouraging his Foot, cauſed two or thrve hundred horſemen to alight, which after a skirmiſh of half an hour, forced my men to retreat, with the loſs of thirty or forty ſlain on the place. Thus we loſt that Poſt which we had kept three dayes, and the Enemy underſtanding its importance, cauſed it to be fortified and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched in ſuch a manner, that the difficulty of retaking it, cauſed us to loſe the thought of it.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after, a furious Skirmiſh happened near St. <hi>Maries</hi> of <hi>Capua,</hi> which laſted two or three hours with equal advantage to either ſide, The Sieur <hi>de Mallet</hi> unable to imagine on what account <hi>Don Lewis Poderico</hi> had cauſed him to be engaged, as ſoon as it was at an end, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that while he amuzed him by this Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, he had cauſed the Mills of <hi>Morrone</hi> to be
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:57207:251"/>
burnt, ſuppoſing we ſhould have been more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded than we were by it.</p>
            <p>The next day the Sieur <hi>de Mallet</hi> ſent me word that <hi>Don Lewis de Poderico</hi> had intimated to him that he deſired a perſonal Meeting, by my permiſſion, which I granted, with order to ſound him as much as poſſible, and ſeek as well to diſcover his thoughts as thoſe of the Nobility that were with him in <hi>Capua.</hi> Each of theſe endeavoured to gain the other by many propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals and advantageous offers: and after a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of two hours parted without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding any thing but a ſettlement of quarter between them, with many expreſſions of recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal eſteem and kindneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the mean time percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Troops very much weakned, reſolved to reform them, but changed his thoughts when he found all his Officers ready to mutiny, and wanting money as well as victuals, which was neceſſary to prevent his mens disbanding, he was fain to melt his Plate, to give them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſatisfaction by that ſmall aſsiſtance. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> having no intimation of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been declared Viceroy in place of the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> who he knew could no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at <hi>Naples,</hi> and was become uſeleſs to his ſervice, by reaſon of the general diſtruſt and contempt of his perſon, ſent him order to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and to the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in his place in quality of Viceroy.

            <p>He took up at <hi>Genoa</hi> two hundred thouſand Crowns on his own credit, putting it abord the Galley of Captain <hi>John Andrew Brignolle,</hi> and ſome little Corn on another, himſelf alſo going abord, and intending for <hi>Gaeta,</hi> from whence he diſpatched <hi>Dom Antonio de Cabrera</hi> to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> to acquaint him with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, and the choice had been made in <hi>Spain</hi> of his perſon. <hi>Don John</hi> was ſurpriſed at this news which he little expected, but comporting himſelf with much diſcretion, concealed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, and at his arrival on the ſecond of <hi>March,</hi> received him with as great demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of joy, as if he had come on ſome other account then to diſpoſſeſs him of his authority. I expected that an emulation between them would cauſe a diviſion, by which I hoped to make advantage; but whatſoever their thoughts were, they concealed them with ſo great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, that nothing appeared. The Earl of <hi>Eril, Don John</hi>'s high Steward, returning from <hi>Madrid,</hi> whether he had carried the news of the Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> his renunciation, and the poſſeſſion <hi>Don John</hi> had taken of the Viceroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, brought with him a Confirmation of his Authority, and an Order to the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> not to ſtir from <hi>Rome</hi>: but having already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his Charge, he would not reaſſume it, reſerving only the badges and appearances of the ſupreme authority, with the quality of Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary in all Italy.</p>
            <p>The arrival of this new Miniſter troubed
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:57207:253"/>
me, apprehending his wit and active ſpirit, and being (to my diſpleaſure) ſenſible that Heaven hath ſeldom failed of a miracle in favour of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> when at the point of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The arrival of theſe two Gallies preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the effects of the deſpair the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were reduced to, by bringing money enough to pay their Troops a Muſter, and ſome little corn, no more being left than was ſufficient for four dayes.</p>
            <p>Reports beginning to be ſpred through all <hi>Italie</hi> of our Enemies wants and weakneſs, of the diſſatisfaction of the Nobility, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my authority, all Princes thought it time to take their meaſures; and as there are but very few of them that have not ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Revenues in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> they begin to apply themſelves to me for their preſervation, with good words and wiſhes, but no aſſiſtance. My friendſhip was ſought after, and adviſes were ſent me; and this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar from a perſon very powerfull and well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that I ſhould uſe all means to rid my hands of <hi>Gennaro,</hi> who betrayed me, and was alone capable of precipitating me from the height to which fortune had raiſed me. The beſt of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> the greateſt part of their fortunes lying in this Kingdom, had recourſe to my protection, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying themſelves to be much concerned in my ſucceſſes, and aſſuring me that whatſoever I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from that Republick ſhould be granted me. The Cardinals and other great perſons at <hi>Rome,</hi> moved by the ſame intereſt, ſent me daily
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:57207:254"/>
proteſtations of their friendſhip and ſervice. Nay Prince <hi>Lodoviſio</hi> himſelf, as zealous as he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> made applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me, fearing the loſs of his Principality of <hi>Venoſa,</hi> which cauſed me to judge that he looked on my affairs as in a ſucceſsful poſture. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable <hi>Colonna</hi> offered me, that if by ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation I would ſecure to him an equivalent of what he had in <hi>Sicily,</hi> he would come and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe under me the Charge of Conſtable of the Kingdom. The Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> ordered their Reſident to demand Audience of me (with I thrice gave him) and to compliment me on the happy ſucceſs of my Enterpriſe, which I ought to compleat by following my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, with aſſurance, that were it not for the preſſures that lay upon them by reaſon of the Turkiſh Warr, they would as well aſsiſt me with money as vows and prayers, conjuring me, (as ſoon as I ſhould arrive at a ſettlement, which they hoped to ſee very ſodainly) to permit them to make Levies in this Country to ſerve them in their preſent neceſsity, and ſecure Candie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the attempts of the Infidels.</p>
            <p>The Pope believing, that at the arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would be forced to leave all, and informed that orders to that purpoſe were already come, and that they were to attend the Succors of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Gaeta</hi> and other Maritime Towns, and that this reſolution had twice arrived at the point of being put in practice, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>France</hi> making advantage by it, would poſſeſs it ſelf of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> This
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:57207:254"/>
giving him an extraordinary jealouſie, obliged him to flatter and incourage my ambition, by repreſenting that if I had thoughts of aſſuming the Throne, of whoſe aſcent I wanted but one ſtep, all <hi>Italy</hi> would aſſiſt me; for whoſe liberty and my preſervation he would make a league; and that to teſtifie the affection he had for me, he ſhould think himſelf obliged to more than counſels and prayers; and if I undertook this glorious deſign, promiſed to inveſt me, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lend me three hundred thouſand Crowns. Not tranſported by vanity I anſwered him, that his affection layed infinite obligations upon me, that time would inſtruct me what ſhould be fit for me to do after the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould be driven away; but that in the mean time I did not only accept the money he was pleaſed to promiſe me, but (being in extreme want of it) moſt humbly beſought him to ſupply me with it ſodainly, after which I aſſured him he ſhould quickly ſee compleated the deſigne I had undertaken, and advanced ſo farr contrary to the opinion of all the world. He reiterated his proffers, but the money came not, only his bare advice that I ſhould not forget what he told me at parting, with advertiſement to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt all mankind, and above all equally to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and have a great care of the ſecurity of my Perſon. All things encouraged my hopes, and made me judge my ſelf nearer the haven than I had thought, ſince the world ſeemed ſo throughly perſwaded of my good fortune, and the enemies ruine. Theſe

appearances gave me ſome proſpect of good ſucceſs, and I thought ſo intelligent and well informed perſons, as all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not in ſuch a manner on my conſideration, without diſcovering at a diſtance, what the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrance of the affairs that lay upon me hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me from diſcerning ſo clearly. I therefore thought I was to be more carefull of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and to conſider as well my own actions as theirs I was jealous of, without neglect of the ſmalleſt matters, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being ſo near their ruin, would leave no wayes unattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for procuring mine.</p>
            <p>My juſt apprehenſion of <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s practices, made me reſolve to diſpatch him at the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and to that end to endeavour to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs my ſelf of the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Tower. And doubting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might by money get ſome of our Poſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which for five moneths toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been commanded by the ſame perſons, which muſt needs diſcover to them who were corruptible, I put the people in mind how much thoſe perſons muſt neceſſarily be wearied by ſo long a continuance in armes, that therefore they ought to have reſt, and their fidelity and courage be reſerved for important enterpriſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obliging them to continual fatigue. My pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was received with incredible applauſe, and they reſolved to put the Guard of the Town into my hands, and truſt their ſafety to me, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing me to make ſuch levies as I thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and nominate the Officers, and they would find arms for the Souldiers I ſhould liſt. I had
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:57207:256"/>
already a ſettled Stock for their ſubſiſtance, and wanted money only for the Levies, which could amount to no great ſum. I had 20000 Crowns at <hi>Rome,</hi> which I reſolved to ſend for by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine de Lieto,</hi> to whom I gave eight Felucca's well armed. He provided for his departure, but was hindered by ill weather till the tenth of <hi>March.</hi> He had enriched himſelf by many moveables which he intended to take with him, as Pictures, Plate and other goods of value, and as perſons of low birth are moſt eaſily tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vanity, he would needs take with him a great Train and Equipage, with part of my Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and inſtead of a ſpeedy return, ſtayed to divert himſelf at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhew his ſplendor and magnificence, which proved the cauſe of my ruin; for if I had received my money time enough, after my Levies had been compleated, I would have changed the Guards of all the Poſts every night, by drawing of lots, by which means it would have been impoſſible for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to have taken any certain meaſures ſince they could not foreſee who they were to deal with. I now wanted not good and experienced Officers; for beſides many <hi>Frenchmen</hi> which came daily to me, moſt of the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> that ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Flanders, Catalonia,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> ran away, and came to me in Troops; and (had not my ruin been ſo ſodain) not one of them would have continued in thoſe Armies.</p>

About ten a Clock at night <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtino Mollo</hi> brought to me Captain <hi>Ignatio Spagnuollo</hi> to acquaint me with <hi>Vincenzo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea</hi>'s Order to him to be ready with his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. which conſiſted of Three hundred Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, to kill me the next morning in my Pallace; that the reſolution had been taken, but he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me of his fidelity, and that he would keep his men in Arms, to march whitherſoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them.</p>
            <p>The Tenth in the morning I viſited all the Town, to take cognizance of whatſoever was in agitation, and perceived the People ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what altered, by the apprehenſion had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them of my deſign to plunder and abandon
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:57207:257"/>
them. I diſabuſed very many of them, and ſent Orders to <hi>Auguſtin de Lieto</hi> not to ſet ſail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he received an important diſpatch from me, which I would go about immediately after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Whileſt I was writing, <hi>Hieronimo Fabra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> my Secretary, came in great diſorder to tell me, that there was an inſurrection, and above Four thouſand men in Arms in the Market-place, all whoſe talk was of coming to cut off my head in my Pallace. He was enraged to ſee that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of concerning my ſelf at this advice, I laughed at it as a trifle: another perſon came immediately to confirm it with no leſs diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and apprehenſion than the former: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called for Horſes, and ſending for the Knight <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> gave him Order to go to the Market-place, and ſee what paſſed, and carefully obſerving the countenances and actions of all, take notice what Leaders appeared at the Head of theſe Mutineers, and what he could hear them ſay. I called for Boots, but my ſervants were in ſuch diſorder, they knew not what they did, and ſought all up and down for what they had in their hands. By that time I had put on my Boots, the Knight <hi>de Fourbin</hi> came to tell me that Five or Six thouſand men were in Armes in the Market-place, and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi> and <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> at their Head; that they were much incenſed, and continually cried, <hi>God and the People.</hi> This News pleaſed me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing of <hi>Spain</hi> being intermixed, I knew it was no more than a Commotion, which my preſence would eaſily pacifie. He haſtened
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:57207:258"/>
me to go down and take Horſe, that I might be in a condition to appear and defend my ſelf.</p>
            <p>At the arrival of the Mutineers, I heard a great noiſe before my Pallace, and looking out of my Window, ſaw all ſuch of the People as had no Arms run away for fear, and made a ſign with my Hat to them to ſtand, crying out, That it was nothing but a little diſorder, which I would inſtantly remedy. I went down and mounting a great and fiery Courſer, took with me fifteen of the beſt Musketiers of the Guard, which that day was of <hi>Diego Peres</hi> his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he himſelf went along, and I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to keep ſtill before my Horſe, to do what I ſhould appoint him: I then ſent to all our Poſts, that care might be taken of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and that they might be very vigilant, to prevent the Enemies taking advantage by the greatneſs of the diſorder was likely to be in the Town: afterwards I marched, and had hardly gone Two hundred Paces, when, hard by the Gate of <hi>Capua,</hi> over againſt a Chappel called St. <hi>Catharines,</hi> I perceived <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> with his Sword drawn, on an <hi>Iſabella</hi> coloured Horſe with a white Mane and Tail, which <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito Paſtena</hi> had given <hi>Gennaro,</hi> who was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe himſelf at the Head of the Mutiniers on a Black Courſer, continually crying out, <hi>God and the People.</hi> As ſoon as I came within Thirty Paces, I fired upon them, minding my Musketiers to take good aim, which they performed ſo ill, that none was either ſlain or
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:57207:258"/>
hurt; yet <hi>Vincenzo</hi> and <hi>Gennaro</hi> ran inſtantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: the laſt of theſe regained the Carmelites Tower, where he ſhut himſelf up with ſo much fear, that he appeared no more that day, nor ſuffered any to enter; the other by the ſwiftneſs of his Horſe got to the Market-place, from thence to ſeek a ſecure retreat. I immediately rid up to this revolted People, and asking them who had cauſed them to take Arms, and on what pretence? they told me they had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that I intended to go away and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them to the fury of the Spaniards, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me all that was rich and precious in their Town: I replied, They might have eaſily obſerved, in the time I had been amongſt them, that avarice was not my vice, of which they ſhould never have a pretence to accuſe me, but if they thought me guilty, and gave ſo eaſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to Traitors, that cried me down, in order to their immediate deſtruction, or were diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with my Conduct and Service, they might have let me know it without coming tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to murther me; and that having Felucca's ready at <hi>Poſilippo,</hi> and the wind favorable (if my misfortune rendered me diſagreeable to them) I would embark immediately, and they ſhould afterwards become ſenſible whether <hi>Gennaro</hi> and <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> (who had a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient influence over them to cauſe them to take Arms againſt me) would prove more faithful and uſeful to them, and whether they were able to ſave them from the revenge and cruelty of the Spaniards, prevent the plundering and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:57207:259"/>
their Houſes, ſecure the honour of their Wives, and preſerve their lives, as well as their Childrens, as I had to that time done; or aſſure them of the liberty and quiet I promiſed them, if they would afterwards have more kindneſs for me, a greater ſenſe of my ſervices, and leſs confidence in Traitors, that ſought my deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, only in order to reduce them under the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Tyranny.</p>
            <p>All theſe Mutineers were mollified by my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and cried out, They deſerved not the affection I had for them; that they would all die for me, and that all ſuch as loved me not, or refuſed to obey me, were to be dragged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Streets and hung up by the feet. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me then, my friends, ſaid I, and let us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether pacifie the diſorder of the Town, I will eſtabliſh quiet, and employ the remainder of my life, to obtain you a laſting freedom from oppreſſion. I kept on towards the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, followed by them all with a thouſand benedictions and acclamations of God and his Highneſs, without once mentioning the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to make it appear that they looked on my intereſts as the ſame with their own.</p>
            <p>Coming to the Market-place I ſpoke much in the manner I had done before, to ſuch as I found there, which was heard with the ſame demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of reſpect and kindneſs. <hi>Onoffrio Pogane,</hi> one of the highlieſt affected to <hi>Genna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> and all others that I ſuſpected, was brought to me with twenty Rapiers points at his breaſt, and I made his Company lay down their
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:57207:259"/>
Armes, after a ſevere reprehenſion for his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſed them to take them up without my Order, and for his having been one of thoſe that marched at the head of ſuch as came to attempt my life; giving me ſome marks of his penitence, or rather of his fear, I pardoned him, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to go to his Quarter, and take care that all might be peaceable.</p>
            <p>As I went out of the Market-place, I ſaw a great concourſe of people come the length of a Street, and perceived it to be the Peoples Elect, who with as many as he could draw together, came to joyn with <hi>Gennaro</hi> and <hi>Vincenzo.</hi> He was carried in an open Sedan with his Sword drawn, and inſtead of appeaſing the Tumult, endeavoured by his diſcourſe to make a new Commotion. His ſurpriſal at meeting me was great, and augmented when he ſaw all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions joyn with thoſe that followed me, and cry out, more than the reſt, <hi>God and his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> The people looked upon me, and by a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their hands demanded my permiſſion to cut off his Head, and drag him about the Streets, but I by another ſign let them know I would not have it done; and perceiving him a little come to himſelf, asked him what he pretended? and whither he went? He told me, that having heard there was a diſturbance in the Town, he went to ſeek me to receive my Orders, and know what was to be done. I then appointed him to cauſe all the Inhabitants to lay down their Arms, and aſſemble the Magiſtrates at St. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> and from thence come home to
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:57207:260"/>
me, to know what I would command him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The Knight <hi>de Fourbin</hi> meeting <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> preſenting his Piſtol to his Breaſt, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Who he was for? the other anſwered, For God and the People, and this being that which was ordinarily ſaid, he durſt not fire; but thought to bring him to me, which the other apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſcaped by the ſwiftneſs of his Horſe. It was my misfortune that I had not enough open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf to the Knight <hi>de Fourbin</hi> in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, who apprehending I might blame him for uſing any violence without order, failed of ridding me of the moſt dangerous Perſon of <hi>Naples,</hi> and whoſe death was the moſt neceſſary to me.</p>
            <p>I afterwards rid round the Town, which my preſence and diſcourſe quieted, and returning to <hi>Porta,</hi> I was told that ſome were intrenching themſelves at <hi>La Pietra del Peſce, Onoffrio Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gano</hi>'s Quarter; I ſent two young men, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, called the <hi>Riga</hi>'s, that were well beloved in the Town, to tell the Captain, that if as I came that way I found not the Trenches ſlighted, or if I perceived the leaſt murmure or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, I would cauſe him to be hanged by the foot. He obeyed my Orders with all marks of reſpect and entire ſubmiſſion. Thus leaving all quiet, I returned to my Pallace, there to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Peoples Elect, with the Captains of the Quarters, whom I had commanded to come thither, to hear from me what they were to do on an occaſion ſo difficult and dangerous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:57207:260"/>This great Tumult vaniſhed like a Fire of Straw, and as it began without occaſion, ended without effuſion of bloud, though in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, its conſequences were likely to have been very fatal. The Peoples Elect coming to me, followed by all the Captains of the ſeveral Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Magiſtrates of the City, I complained of his proceeding, and that his endeavours had tended more to incenſe than appeaſe the People; telling him that if for the future any ſuch diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances happened, he was to know of me how he ſhould comport himſelf and receive my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; that the buſineſs being ſo well paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I would once again give Teſtimonies of my Clemency, but they ſhould be the laſt; for at the next diſturbance that happened I would make exemplary puniſhments. After he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes beſought my pardon, he alſo begged it for <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> to which at the requeſt of the Captains of the Quarters, I condiſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with ſecurity to come and acknowledge his fault, and caſt himſelf at my feet. He came preſently after, and falling on his Knees before me, at firſt pretended to juſtifie himſelf and make excuſes, but afterwards acknowledging that his Crime deſerved the ſevereſt puniſhment, proteſted, that in conſideration of his life that I had given him, he would afterwards be the moſt faithful and ſubmiſſive of all men. I told him he was to thank the Magiſtrates of the Town that had interceded for it; for whom I had too great a reſpect to deny them any thing: that his attempt upon my life merited the moſt
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:57207:261"/>
cruel puniſhments; that he ſhould take are of his future comportment, that no faults of his could be pardonable after ſo many relapſes, and that he ſhould be mindful of the teſtimonies he had received of my goodneſs, and of his own ingratitude and obſtinate malice; that I would watch him narrowly, very well underſtanding all his deſigns and intrigues, and that the leaſt falſe ſtep ſhould expoſe him to be puniſhed as a Diſturber of the publick quiet, a Traytor to his Country, and Correſpondent of its Tyrants: afterwards beginning to rally with him, I advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him never to take Arms, ſince he carried his Sword ſo unhandſomly, that he ought no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>I ſent to <hi>Gennaro</hi> to come to me on my Parole, and that he ſhould make haſte whileſt I was in the humor of pardoning. He was willing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey me, but fearing the People would tear him in pieces by the way, ſent to deſire my Guards for a Convoy, which was no more than neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Women railing at him, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People every moment ready to fall upon him. At his arrival he fell on his Knees before me, and kiſſed my feet, weeping and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, being naturally very timorous; I let him continue a good while in this poſture, unable to ſay any thing more to me, than conjure me for the ſake of our Lady of the Carmelites and St. <hi>Gennaro</hi> to ſpare his life, embracing my Knees with all his ſtrength. At laſt I cauſed him

to ariſe, with aſſurance that I had forgot all his Crimes, and that he needed fear nothing, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he became more faithful and more diſcreet for the future. I reproached him that he could not deny that had not my arrival at <hi>Naples</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, he had been put to death the next day; that this was the third ſedition I had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him for; that he had ſeveral times intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attempt againſt my life, and that I knew the occaſion of his coming to ſeek me at <hi>Jaſper de Romero</hi>'s; that I was not ignorant of his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Enemy, all particulars whereof I could tell him; that I had informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Negotiations with <hi>France</hi> to ruin me, by which he had hindered me from being aſſiſted, and the People ſupplied; that himſelf ſhould be judge what his ingratitude for me, and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to his Countrey merited.

commanded <hi>Mattheo d' Amore</hi> to march thither with his Company, and <hi>Gennaro</hi> to ſend order for his reception; for ſecurity of which I kept him with me, till I ſhould have notice that I was obeyed. Thus I drew from this ſedition an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of my credit, and poſſeſt my ſelf of the moſt important Poſt of the Town. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theo d' Amore</hi> ſending me word that his Company had admittance, I diſmiſſed the Magiſtrates and <hi>Gennaro,</hi> who never afterwards came at me, alledging for excuſe that he was no longer ſafe in the Town, that the People (on occaſion of this laſt Tumult) had ſuch a hatred for him, they could neither ſee nor hear him named without horror.

of Troops. The Twelfth of <hi>March</hi> Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was publickly made in the Market-place, with general applauſe, and their Eſtates being confiſcated, I uſed all endeavour to diſcover the money they had offered me, but they had hid it ſo well I could get no news of it, and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing belonging to them, but a very fair and good Horſe, which I gave the Knight <hi>de Four-bin,</hi> that was killed under me the day I was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards reduced to extreameſt want, not having Victuals ſufficient for their Troops and Garriſons of their Caſtles, deſirous to free themſelves of all uſeleſs mouths, permitted all people that lived within their limits, to go to us; by which means ſo many arrived in the ſpace of two dayes, as made a great diſcovery of the general inclination, We did our ſelves prejudice by the reception of ſo many perſons, who muſt otherwiſe have eaten upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: but after two dayes refuſal, we not being in ſo great ſcarcity, I had compaſſion for ſo many people periſhing by hunger, and at the requeſts of their friends and relations received all that came, becauſe being of that Countrey, the Spaniards had ſo great hatred for them, that they would gladly have ſeen every one of them exterminated. I now thought my affairs in ſo good a condition, that (with a little patience) I might aſſure my ſelf to ſee them arrive at a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py concluſion.

hundred and fifty thouſand load was provided in <hi>Apulia,</hi> and fourſcore thouſand in <hi>Baſilica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> on which a moderate price was ſet; but there being ſome difficulty for bringing it to me by reaſon of the Town of <hi>Ariana</hi> that lay in the way, I endeavoured to become Maſter of it, which proved eaſie, by a Treaty with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs of <hi>Bonalbergo,</hi> which (to my great ſorrow) proved fatal to him: He ſent a Friar to aſſure me of his ſervice, and propound the beſieging it, that delivering it to me, he might become my Priſoner of War, and that afterwards being ſet at liberty on his Parole, never any more to bear Arms againſt me, he might unſuſpected paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Calabria,</hi> and making his friends and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons declare, poſſeſs himſelf of the greateſt part of the ſtrong places of that Province, where he had very great credit, being rich, and of the Noble and Ancient Family of <hi>Spinelli.</hi> The joy I received at this welcome News may eaſily be imagined.

            <p>Two dayes after the priſoners were brought me, the two <hi>Cavaniglia</hi>'s bound, the others not ſo, becauſe Children.

not being more ſenſibly concerned. The poor youth, very handſom and very witty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo well theſe teſtimonies of my kindneſs and ſorrow, that he promiſed never to forget them, but to remain all his life inſeparable from my intereſts. After ſome dayes I returned him to his Grandmother, the Princeſs of St. <hi>George,</hi> that ſent for him; and I muſt confeſs that one of my greateſt regrets during my impriſonment, was that I wanted time to puniſh the Authors of ſo horrid a Cruelty, on which account whileſt I live nothing can comfort me.</p>
            <p>The Banditi giving me new diſturbances by the like actions through the whole Kingdom, I reſolved to take an opportunity to diſcharge my ſelf of all their Leaders; who by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and plunderings, made uſeleſs all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to gain the Nobility, as ſoon as any of whom ſeemed affected to me, they ſought to diſguſt them by ill uſage. <hi>Polito Paſtena</hi> was one of the forwardeſt on ſuch occaſions, not deſiring the Kingdoms ſettlement, knowing that then he might no longer rob with impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor continue his Authority in <hi>Salerno,</hi> and all the farther Principality, where he reigned as Soveraign. I had given the Duke <hi>de la Rocca</hi> ſafe-guards for ſome of his Lands, which he ſlighting, ſent to plunder, as incenſed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had been made to me. I writ him a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſomething blunt, to which he ſent me an Anſwer by a Prieſt, whom I immediately asked if I had been obeyed, and he going about to make excuſes in his Friends behalf, I refuſed to hear
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:57207:265"/>
him, and tore the Letter he brought me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reading it, telling him angrily that I admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no reply to my Orders, but would have them executed punctually and ſpeedily: <hi>Polito Paſtena</hi> it ſeems will be independant and play the little Soueraigne (ſaid I)? tell him from me that if he continues, I will teach him his duty, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him according to his deſert: He ſhall find no ſecurity againſt my power and reſentment in <hi>Salerno,</hi> nor amongſt his Banditi, to what part ſoever he retires I will find wayes to come at him, and be as certainly Maſter of his head as I was of <hi>Paul</hi>'s of <hi>Naples.</hi> But if for the future he become more ſubmiſſive and obedient, I will cheriſh and conſider him as formerly, and give him more Authority and Credit than ever. His Meſſenger carried him back this Anſwer, which made him tremble, notwithſtanding his great confidence; which I perceived by his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cauſing inſtantly to be rendered all that had been taken away, and without reply or delay complying with all I ordered him ever ſince. The diſſimulation of his diſcontent diminiſhed it not, but obliged him to a nearer friendſhip with <hi>Gennaro.</hi> He ſent him a diſpatch to be conveyed to the French Miniſters, offering them, in caſe they would ſend the Fleet to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerno,</hi> to put it into their hands, and to draw together all the Banditi of St. <hi>Severine, La Cava</hi> and <hi>Nocera,</hi> to the number of Six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men. This cauſed the misfortune of the enterpriſe of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> of which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards having notice by this diſpatch (which fell
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:57207:265"/>
into their hands after my impriſonment,) at the arrival of their Fleet, they poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Angri,</hi> which is the paſs of the Mountains, and by it preventing the meeting of the forces of the three Towns above-mentioned, cauſed him to diſtruſt ſome treacherie, ſince nothing they had given him hope of had been performed. This obliged him to reimbark with a great deal of haſte, and but little honour, of which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but acknowledge my ſelf to have been very glad, to ſee that (with all this powerful corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies, the Kings Fleet, and a conſiderable Body of men to have landed) he could effect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, whereas I alone, and without any aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſubdued a great Kingdom, and ſubſiſted five moneths, though my Conduct was decried, and I deprived of the honour of an atchievment ſo extraordinary and incredible.</p>
            <p>The Peoples Elect continuing his correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Enemy, I reſolved to puniſh him, but it being dangerous to do it publickly, and by the hand of Juſtice (the authority his Imployment gave him conſidered) I reſolved on an indirect way towards it, which ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with ſuch adreſs as ſhould give no cauſe of ſuſpicion, and his death ſeem the effect of a popular Tumult.

him, that they reſolved immediately to cut off his head, which I expreſly forbid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to cauſe him to be ſecured that very day, and to bring him to his Tryal, and cauſe him to dye by Law, it being of great concernment to draw from him by force of torments, the names of all ſuch of the Cabal as correſponded with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> After this I ſent them away re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending ſecrecy: and deſirous to make uſe of ſo favorable a Conjuncture, commanded <hi>Cicio Battimiello</hi> and <hi>Peppo Ricco,</hi> Perſons reſolute and faithful, and fit to execute an affair of this nature, to dine in that Quarter to keep the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor warm, and to have ſome ready to follow them at the hour I ſhould intimate. When I roſe from dinner I was told there was ſome diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in <hi>Porto,</hi> and that the Inhabitants took arms. I went immediately thither, where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tumult, I asked the reaſon, they told me that having diſcovered more treaſons of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Elect, they could no longer ſuffer him, and reſolved to go to his houſe and cut off his head, and drag his body about the Streets. I forbid them to undertake any ſuch violence, which as long as I commanded in the Town ſhould not be ſuffered, cauſing them to lay down their arms; and whilſt I was on the way home, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Batimiello, that went along to wait on me thither, to return and make them reaſſume them, and go and execute their deſign, of which I could not be ſuſpected after having appeaſed the diſorder: that he ſhould loſe no time, becauſe I was informed that <hi>Onoffrio Pagano</hi> was with
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:57207:266"/>
him, who I was deſirous ſhould run the ſame fortune.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I came home, I went into my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet to entertain <hi>Marco Antonio Brancaccio,</hi> with whom I had not a quarter of an hours diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe before my Servants came to tell me, that a great noiſe was heard of abundance of people that had tumultuouſly flocked about my Palace. Looking out at the Window I perceived them, carrying a head on the point of a Pike, and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a naked body by one foot, the boyes having torn off the clothes by the way, I called to them to ſtand, and asked what ſpectacle that was? They told me it was the body of <hi>Antonio Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zella</hi> the Peoples Elect, and that his head that was carried on the Pike: <hi>Cicio Batimiello</hi> and <hi>Peppo Ricco</hi> marching amongſt the formoſt, I asked them how they durſt take the boldneſs, after the prohibition I had made, to undertake ſuch an action, for which I had a great mind to cauſe them to be hanged: Falling on their knees they begged my pardon, and my leave to come ſecurely to me, which I granted them. They came up to my Hall, whether they brought <hi>Antonio Mazella</hi>'s two Brothers-in-law bound, telling me that after I had appeaſed the Tumult of <hi>Porto,</hi> they had advertiſement of a new treaſon of the Peoples Elect, and of a conſpiracy of his againſt my life, which was to be put in execution the next morning. That incenſed by this they had immediately puniſhed him, apprehending that my over great clemency would have pardoned him; that they willingly ſubmitted to what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:57207:267"/>
I pleaſed to inflict upon them, and would die contented to have given a teſtimonie of their affection to me and their Country: I pardon ſaid I the indiſcretion of your zeal, but if you ever do the like I will make you ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that none in <hi>Naples</hi> ſhall afterwards dare ſuch an attempt. For terror to others I commanded his head to be ſet on a Poſt in the Market-place, and his body to be hanged on one foot; One of his Brothers-in-law I cauſed to be diſcharged immediately, being aſſured of his fidelity, and the other (to exempt him from fury of the people) I ſent to the Vicarie, and two dayes after ſent him a paſs to go whether he pleaſed, provided he left the Town.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were very ſenſibly concerned at this tragedie, loſing by it a Perſon they very much depended on. <hi>Gennaro</hi> was moſt furiouſly alarmed at it, and to avoid the like, reſolved to embark with all his treaſure on a Felucca, and retire to <hi>Venice.</hi> I cunningly ſent him Maſters of Feluccas that pretended to ſerve him, but that letting me know the time of his departure would give me opportunity to ſeiſe upon him with all his wealth, which would have ſupplied my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and in a few dayes have made an end of our buſineſs; and ſurpriſing him in the very act of abandoning the Town, and carrying away the beſt things that were in it, I might have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to have been hanged with the general applauſe of all the people. He could not have avoided this ſnare that was ſo handſomely laid for him if the Baron of <hi>Rovrou,</hi> a diligent Spie
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:57207:267"/>
upon all my actions, that he might give him an account of them, had not told him that I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſecret Audiences to Mariners, of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jealous, he ſo particularly informed himſelf, that he diſcovered they were the ſame he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to embark with, which made him aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the deſign he thought to have put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the next morning. This diſcovery driving him to deſpair, obliged him to ſend one he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in to conclude ſomething with <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> and the Viceroy, of which being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Auguſtino M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>llo,</hi> I thought I ought to rid my hands of him at what rate ſoever: but this was not eaſie, he never going out of his Tower, and being on that account ſecure from being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as the Peoples Elect had been, neither could any thing be undertaken againſt him but by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen force, and great effuſion of bloud, his party within being equal to my Garriſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſtino Mollo</hi> to free me from this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, came at night and told me, I have brought you that will free you from <hi>Gennaro:</hi> his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons merit death, and in what manner Juſtice be done on him is not very conſiderable: look on this Vial ful of ſo clear and beautiful water, in four dayes time it will puniſh all his infidelities; the Captain of the Guard ſhall undertake to give him, without his diſtruſt, it having no taſte at all. On the next day, which was Friday, he cauſed him to drink it all at dinner; but whether the doſe was too weak, or that having eaten no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but cabbage dreſſed with oyl (which is certainly a great antidote) he fell a vomiting
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:57207:268"/>
immediately, which freed him from a danger ſo evident, and that appeared ſo certain. He eſcaped with a head-ake and pain in his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach for four or five dayes, without any ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the matter. I diſcovered ſome abuſe in my Secretaries office, of which complaints had been formerly made, and a diſpatch I had there refuſed, being a fourth time preſented to ſigne amongſt ſeveral other Papers, I ſent for <hi>Hieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Fabrani</hi> my Secretary, and after a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priment threatned to hang him if he ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the like fault. He layed the blame on his Clarks, whom I cauſed to be all immediately turned away (exept <hi>Innocentio</hi> in whom I had a great deal of confidence) ordering him to ſeek others, aſſuring him that another time his Clarks ſhould not excuſe him, but his own perſon be reſponſible. Underſtanding that in the time I had been at <hi>Naples</hi> he had gained forty thouſand Crowns, I asked him to lend me twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, promiſing to pay him out of the money I had ſent for to <hi>Rome.</hi> He told me that report was ſpread abroad to do him a bad office, and that he had no money, the contrary of which was very hard for me to make appear, he having hid what he had gained, the greateſt part of it in Religious Houſes, that he might ſend it to <hi>Rome</hi> at the firſt opportunity. His avarice cauſed my ruin; but he himſelf went not ſcotfree, it coſting him not only his wealth but his life, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in the time of his impriſonment diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he writ to <hi>Cardinal Mazarin</hi> (his Letters having been taken at <hi>Rome</hi> and returned to the

Viceroy by Cardinal <hi>Panſirolle</hi>) cut off his head: he gave intelligence of the facility of ſurpriſing <hi>Caſtello novo</hi> at the return of the Fleet by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation he had managed.</p>
            <p>The trial of the Priſoners of the Garriſon of <hi>Averſa</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Modena</hi> went forward: I had ſet it a foot to ſatisfie the people, though I reſolved when a handſome occaſion ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, to ſend the Baron into <hi>France,</hi> finding him to be innocent, and guilty of no other crime but the misfortune that oppreſſed him by reaſon of his good nature which betrayed him to faults, though his intentions were alwayes good.</p>
            <p>A <hi>French</hi> Phyſitian that belonged to me, being convicted of many pilferings and cheats, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (becauſe he was my domeſtick) to have him hanged for an example; but the women of the Town perſiſting many daies to beg his pardon, I could not at laſt refuſe them; I therefore kept him in priſon till I could find convenience of ſending him out of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The peoples affection for me increaſed daily, with their joy and the Enemies deſpair at the arrival of corn from <hi>Apulia,</hi> the firſt Convoy bringing three hundred Mules, the ſecond three dayes after five hundred, which ſtill continued augmenting till Thurſday in Paſſion-week, when there came fifteen hundred, which made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve on the firſt of <hi>May</hi> to abate the price of bread, to what it had been at in the moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful times. I would not at once let the rates fall ſo low, leſt I might afterwards be obliged to raiſe them, and that I might get ſomething
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:57207:269"/>
above the price it coſt me, toward a Stock of two hundred thouſand Crowns, which had wont al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be kept in a readineſs to ſupply the Magazins. Beſides that there muſt be a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſumm to make the firſt purchaſes; I thought therefore of an expedient, which was to demand a liſt of the names of a hundred of the beſt Merchants in the Town, repreſenting to them, that if want of proviſions ſhould once again imbroil us, they would be the firſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, becauſe their houſes and eſtates could not eſcape plundering. That to avoid ſuch an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, every one of them ſhould lend me a thouſand Crowns, and that for ſecurity of this money, they ſhould nominate any two of their number to keep the Keys of the Granaries, and repay themſelves as the Corn ſhould be vended; that in this manner they would run no hazard, and fifteen dayes return them the whole ſumme, and I gain fifty thouſand Crowns, by ſelling it for a third part more than it coſt. This was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally approved, and to put it in execution with greater order, I cauſed <hi>Donato Grimaldi</hi> to be made the peoples Elect in the place of <hi>Antonio Mazella,</hi> to the ſatisfaction of all men, he being a very rich Merchant, and a very honeſt man, not ſuſpected of any correſpondence with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, who in the mean time uſed all poſſible endeavours to avoid their ruine that appeared ſo near, and incited by deſpair, laid hold on all appearances that preſented to them. They ſent Gallies to endeavour to retake the Tower of <hi>Sperlonga,</hi> And drawing out of <hi>Gaeta Don Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:57207:269"/>
de Verrio,</hi> that commanded in the Town, with part of the Garriſon, cauſing likewiſe the Troops of <hi>Capua</hi> to march, ſent the Prince of <hi>la Rocca Romana,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Minorvina,</hi> to block it on one ſide, and our <hi>Banditi</hi> after the defeat of <hi>Papone,</hi> not daring to ſtand in the field againſt them, they about the end of <hi>March</hi> retook <hi>Fondi</hi> and <hi>Sperlonga,</hi> without much reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>St. Severin</hi> made a conſiderable progreſſion in <hi>Calabria</hi>; and at laſt becoming Maſter of the whole Province, drew together the Troops he had promiſed, laid up Oil, Salt and Fiſh to the value of a million of Gold, and made great proviſion of Saltpeter and Powder, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting an occaſion to draw me into <hi>Appulia,</hi> that he might come thither to me, and bring all thoſe things with him. He made the <hi>Baron Durand</hi> Governor of the Principality of <hi>Stiliana,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing daily in ſtrength, had taken <hi>Tordamare,</hi> a very important Poſt in <hi>Baſilicata.</hi> A little diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der happened, to which I gave remedy that very inſtant. <hi>Sabbato Paſtore</hi> having drawn men out of the Garriſons of <hi>Lucera, Foggia,</hi> and <hi>Troya,</hi> for a conſiderable enterpriſe, the Princes of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſarchio</hi> and <hi>Troya,</hi> the Garriſons of thoſe three places being weak, ſurpriſed them in his abſence; of which receiving advice I ordered him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, where he found them abandonned by the Nobility that retired on the news of his coming back. But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are very diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, imagined that their hatred for him was the cauſe of their taking in theſe Towns, and their
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:57207:270"/>
affection for me of their quitting them, at my requeſt, and on aſſurance of ſatisfaction on all occaſions of complaint they thought they might have againſt him; and knowing that I had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret correſpondencies with the Nobility, they oftentimes ſuſpected ſuch things as neceſſity compelled them to do, to be effects of their kindneſs for me. I ſought not to diſabuſe them of this error, which was advantageous to me, it giving occaſion of a perpetual jealouſie that made them diſoblige perſons of quality, who, what ſervices ſoever they rendred them, could not ſecure themſelves from it.</p>
            <p>The whole Kingdom inclined to me, and I every day heard of ſome or other that came in; ſo that I wanted nothing but our Fleet or the arrival of my brother the Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> to end all in a day. I continually watched oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of all deſignes that ſeemed attemptible; and having ſent to diſcover the condition of the Cuſtom-houſe of Oil, and finding the enemie had no body in it, I thought of an invention very extraordinary. I cauſed a way to be made under ground from a remote and abandoned Garden, near the Convent of <hi>St. Sebastian.</hi> Men continually wrought upon it, and carrying away the earth by Sellers, in ten dayes I had made a Mine of fifteen hundred paces, wide enough for two men to paſs a breſt, which led to the Ciſtern of Oil, the Stones of which wall I cauſed to be three or four dayes bathed with Vinegar and Brandy, which by this means ſoftned, and as ſoon as rubbed, fell in pieces, without any
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:57207:270"/>
noiſe, and might be thrown down without any violence. Things thus diſpoſed in order to the execution of my enterpriſe, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having no diſtruſt, nor any body elſe knowledg of it, ſuch as wrought in the work excepted, I went thither to bring two hundred men into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern of oil, and from thence into the Court of the Cuſtom-houſe, drawing afterwards the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber into the Ciſtern, and all along the paſſage, men readie to ſecond them, and then falling out of the houſe to attack the reare of the gate of <hi>St. Spirito,</hi> the poſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Reformadoes, and the moſt conſiderable they had. In the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza</hi> before that gate I had drawn up three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe, followed by two thouſand foot who entring by the ſtreet of <hi>Toledo,</hi> were to march right to the Viceroy's Palace (a general alarme being the mean while given in all the Quarters) of which (whileſt all was in this diſorder) I might poſſeſs my ſelf without reſiſtance. I had daily aſſurance that they ſuſpected nothing, never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard the men work: that by a hole which looked into the houſe, we might perceive there was no body in it, and the Spies. I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them let me know they were in great ſecurity. The day before I intended to fall on, a young and very fair Nun that had a Brother with the Enemy, perceiving men work, and not underſtanding to what purpoſe, deſired to give them notice of it, and having writ a little note, ſhe went up to the wall of <hi>St. Sebaſtian</hi>'s Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to throw it to them, but an unfortunate Musket-ſhot killing her dead, the note was found
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:57207:271"/>
in her hand and brought to me, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to haſten the execution of my deſign. The night of the twentieth of <hi>March</hi> ſeemed very favorable, being dark and rainy, with ſo much wind, that no other noiſe could be heard. My Horſe and Foot being drawn in <hi>Battalia,</hi> I went to viſit this Cave, and having cauſed the men appointed for it to enter, made the wall be broken down and fall on. We had an alarm by a Soldiers Bandeliers taking fire, all the chargers whereof burning made a great deal of noiſe; but underſtanding what was the matter, it only gave occaſion for laughter, I went to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the Mine, and hearing knocking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove my head, liſtened and perceived we were diſcovered, which was clearer to me when through a hole I ſaw two hundred men in the Ciſtern of Oil, that expected us with a great deal of impatience. I then retreated, and by two holes they had made they fired two Muskets I was informed a few dayes after that this deſign had been diſcovered to them but three hours: I employed the remainder of the night to fill up this paſſage, that the Enemy might not make uſe of our work againſt us: and I was very much troubled after twelve daies labour to have failed (by reaſon of the treaſon of a Captain) of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my ſelf maſter of all the Enemies Quarters, which had been eaſie and infallible as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves afterwards confeſſed to me.</p>
            <p>They began to form new Conſpiracies againſt my life, and by aſſiſtance of <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> laid a deſign which they ſo cunningly carried on,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:57207:271"/>
that I could not poſſibly have avoided it, had it not been diſcovered to me. The twenty third of <hi>March</hi> in the morning <hi>Auguſtino Mollo</hi> came to me at ſix a clock, and brought with him a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian</hi> Gentleman, an underſtanding and reſolute perſon, whom the Duke of <hi>Medina de los Torres,</hi> when he was Viceroy, cauſed expreſly to come to <hi>Naples</hi> to receive a Commiſſin to purſue the Banditi. He was an acquaintance of <hi>Vincenzo Andrea,</hi> who out of his confidence in him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the ſecret, of which he came to give me an account, which was, that <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> had ſent to <hi>Don John</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Ognate,</hi> to ſettle conditions and rewards on <hi>Cicio de Regina,</hi> a Captain in the Regiment of <hi>Sebaſtiano Landi,</hi> who commanded the Gate of <hi>Alba,</hi> and other his accomplices, who were to ſhoot me the five and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> as I heard Maſs in the Church of the <hi>Anonciata</hi>; and that if I carefully obſerved <hi>Gennaro Pinto</hi> (Son of the Maſter of the Poors Bank) all Inſtructions and Orders would be found about him, the conduct of this buſineſs being entruſted to him, as a perſon of wit, and friend of <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi>; and he aſſured me to acquaint me as ſoon as he could inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf further. I gave all Orders neceſſary for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Traitor at his coming back from the Enemy, but in vain, he (inſtead of coming by land) returning in a Felucca; and landing at a little Sally Port at the foot of the wall of <hi>la Pietra del Peſte.</hi> The ſame Gentleman gave me notice of his return, and that all having been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, the attempt was to be made in the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:57207:272"/>
Church of the <hi>Anunciata</hi> at the time of Maſs, and that <hi>Cicio de Regina</hi> was the chief of the Conſpirators as he had before acquainted me. On the morning of this important day I gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to all ſuch as I had confidence in to be ready to march with their Companies on my firſt order. <hi>Cicio de Regina</hi> poſted all his Confederates, of which I had notice, having cauſed him to be very diligently obſerved. When I was almoſt ready I ſaw him come into my Chamber, and (fixing my eyes upon him to ſee if I could diſcover any thing extraordinary in his countenance) asked if he deſired any thing of me. He preſented me a memorial which I attentively read, and told him, your demand is almoſt impoſſible to be granted, and I have refuſed it to many very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable perſons, but I know not how to deny one I ſo much affect, and that is ſo zealous and faithful in my ſervice; then taking a pen I writ a favourable anſwer on his requeſt: Is there any thing elſe, ſaid I, that you deſire for your ſelf or friends? for you can ask nothing that I will not readily grant you. He anſwered there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I embraced him twice or thrice to ſee if my kindneſs would cauſe any remorſe, but could not perceive any alteration in him: and asking whether I went to Maſs to the <hi>Anunciata,</hi> and would go preſently abroad; I told him I went immediately to my Sedan; I will therefore make haſt (ſaid he) to attend you with my friends. I conſidered whether I ſhould beſet the Church, and take him with all his Confederates in it, but loth to ſhed blood there, and imagining they
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:57207:272"/>
would not ſuffer themſelves to be taken without reſiſtance, I went to maſs to the Carmelites; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſomething to be happend that obliged me to ſpeak with <hi>Gennaro,</hi> I commanded <hi>Sebaſtiano Landi,</hi> to keep near him all day, and bring him to me at night, and having an eye upon him, cauſe him to be ſecured if he attempted to eſcape, I ſent for the Auditor General to come to me in the evening, and <hi>Regina</hi>'s Colonel having brought him thither, I let him know I would not ſee a Murtherer and a Traitor, and ſent him to the Vicarie. I asked his Colonel whether he had kept him company all day, and whether he had obſerved any thing extraordinary in him; he told me no, but only that he had made a ſtand under a Porch to make water, where he thought he threw down ſomething, and ſet his foot on it to tread it into the dirt. I ſent to ſearch, and Papers of a very diſpleaſing ſent were brought me. I opened them, and found a Letter to me from <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> unſealed, by which he let me know that the money he had promiſed me was ready at <hi>Genoa,</hi> and that he thanked me for my good will; but that the King his Father, loving the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> though rebellious, yet his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, could not reſolve to enter by the two Poſts I offered to deliver him, to confound all in blood and fire, he having received expreſs order to treat them with all mildneſe and clemency, the King aiming at nothing elſe but to reduce them to their obedience, and pardon their ſedition: Four of theſe Letters had been diſtributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Conſpirators, to the intent that the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:57207:273"/>
firſt of them that could approach my body after my death, ſhould pretend to find it in my poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and by reading it prevent the reſentments of the people. I ſent the Auditor General to put him on the rack, and as ſoon as he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to confeſs to ſend every body out of the room, and write his depoſitions himſelf, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to gain time he would ſeek to concern many conſiderable perſons in his crime, and perhaps ſome of the Nobility: but my ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Maſter of his Confeſſion I might pardon whom I pleaſed, and declare nothing publiquely but what I thought fit. At firſt he denied all, but yielding to the violence of torment, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the artifice of the Letters I have mentioned, that his attempt on my life might paſs unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that making uſe of the general conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he might work on the people to encline to <hi>Spain:</hi> That he was to be rewarded with ſix thouſand Crowns, and a Troop of horſe in the Province of <hi>Monte Fuſcolo</hi>; the orders for which were to be found in a Convent he named, as well as the Nun that had the keeping of them: Sending to ſearch I found them in the following termes.</p>

            <p>Theſe two Papers made a clear diſcovery of the whole enterpriſe, and he gave a particular relation of the manner in which he pretended to execute it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had cauſed thirty or forty Officers to come diſguiſed into the Town. <hi>Don Antonio de St. Severin</hi> when I was Priſoner at <hi>Capua</hi> told me, that he lay ready with fifty men to have fallen out of ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning houſes where they were concealed, to ſecond the Conſpirators and help to make their retreat: But ſeveral perſons of quality have aſſured me he was not there, and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported this out of vanity, to ſeem more zealous for <hi>Spain,</hi> and avoid ſuſpicion of correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie with his Brother <hi>Don John de St. Severin</hi> that commanded for me in <hi>Calabria,</hi> and the Priſoner mentioned nothing of it. The Marquis of <hi>Monte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ilvano</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Brancaccio,</hi> was to have ſent in his Servants and Arms, having forgotten that my arrival at <hi>Naples</hi> freed him from the Vicarie, and the hands of <hi>Gennaro.</hi> But this lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no particular obligation, his liberty having
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:57207:274"/>
been acquired by the common good fortune of all the Priſoners, he did not perhaps think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very much obliged to me for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ottaviello Brancaccio</hi> was one of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and the Priſoner accuſed many others, and amongſt them ſome I very much loved and eſteemed, whom he named to prolong his life, by the confuſion ſuch depoſitions might bring upon me. Thirty Conſpirators were to have been in the Church with Blunderbuſſes, poſted round about the Seat provided for me, and that the leſs notice might be taken of them, they were all at once to fire upon me, at the time of the Elevatton of the Hoſte, when all mens eyes would be fixed on the Prieſt, and the ſound of the Bell was to be the ſignal for diſcharging. <hi>Cicio de Regina</hi> and the reſt that were to be nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt me, had each of them a letter, which he that could firſt approach my body, was to make a ſhew of taking out of my pocket, and amuſe the people by reading it to them whileſt his Confederates made their eſcape. I cauſed him to be condemned, and keeping the informations by me, ſent for <hi>Marco Antonio Brancaccio,</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Marquis of <hi>Monte Silvano, Seignour Joſeph Brancaccio,</hi> and another of the ſame name, with <hi>Seignora Cicia Piuſſa</hi> his Mother, and all the reſt of the Nobility whom this Traitor accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and reading his depoſitions told them, that looking on the Neapolitan Nobility, as incapable of ſo black an attempt, I would not have them ſo much as ſuſpected, but though they had been concerned in it, I too much affected them to dip
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:57207:274"/>
my hands in their blood, and in their preſence burnt the informations. I ſent preſently to ſet at liberty two Servants of the Marquis of <hi>Monte Silvano,</hi> and concealed all the Blunderbuſſes that belonged to him, (on the moſt of which his arms were engraven) ſo to ſtifle all jealouſies that might be had of him, and deſired his Mother and Uncle to bring him to me at night, which they did: I told him, that though I had a pretence of accuſing him of ingratitude on account of having preſerved his life and liberty, of which <hi>Gennaro</hi> would have deprived him the day after my entering the Town. I ſhould ſatisfie my ſelf in this little reproach, knowing that ſhame and remorſe of conſcience, are the greateſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a perſon of honor like himſelf can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly undergo. That I forgot what he had done, and pardoned his contributing, by his Arms and Servants, to the aſſaſſination of a Prince that loved him, and was his benefactor. That I imputed this to exceſs of zeal for his Kings ſervice, which yet he ought to have regulated better, and moderated more in what concerned me, but that I would lay no puniſhment on him, but inſtead thereof give him all teſtimonies of affection and confidence. That I begged his friendſhip, with aſſurance that when he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it, I might more ſafely depend on it, than on that of any other of the Nobility. This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity moved him, and caſting himſelf at my feet, he promiſed never to loſe the memory of ſo great and extraordinary an obligation, and that he would employ his life in ſeeking occaſions
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:57207:275"/>
of ſacrificing it, in teſtimony of his gratitude. I affectionately embraced him, and told him, that what had paſſed ſhould never be any more men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſince from it I derived the advantage of acquiring a perſon of his courage, birth, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: I offered (in caſe he would ſtay with me) to look on him as the beſt of my friends, and give him any imployment he ſhould pretend to, and that if fortune ever put into my hands the diſpoſal of the great Charges and Governments of the Kingdom, he was only to intimate which of them would beſt accommodate him, which I aſſured him on my word I would poſſeſs him of with a very good will.</p>
            <p>This manner of proceeding ſo contrary to the Maxims of the Spaniſh Policy, increaſed the Nobilities affection and eſteem for me, and ſo ſenſibly moved him, that he embraced my knees, and made his acknowledgments in terms ſo reſpective and paſſionate, that I perceived there was no diſſimulation in them, and that I had intirely gained him: but he repreſented to me that the Peoples animoſities would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual danger to him whileſt he ſtayed in the Town, and therefore beſought me to ſuffer him to leave it, ſwearing never more to draw his ſword againſt me; and that as ſoon as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality took horſe to follow my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he would not only himſelf be one of the firſt, but endeavor to engage his friends and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. I then ſent four of my Guards with an Officer, to conduct him ſafely to one of our advanced Poſts, that he might from thence
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:57207:275"/>
paſs to the Enemy. His Mother and Kinſmen made ſo paſsionate and grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that I want words to expreſs them, and I doubt not but as long as he lives, and in what part of the World ſoever he reſide, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in his heart on my behalf a great deal of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, eſteem, and gratitude.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Ottaviello Brancaccio,</hi> a perſon whom poiſons and aſſaſsinations, in which he had been concerned through the whole courſe of his life, had rendered odious to all his relations (he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſhonour of his Family) as well as to the People, I uſed all endeavours to get him into my hands; being a moſt fit perſon to be made an example of with univerſal applauſe. But all the care I took to this purpoſe proved in vain, he eſcaping with the reſt of his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</p>
            <p>The next day, which was the Twenty ſixth of <hi>March, Cicio de Regina</hi> was ſacrificed in expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his deteſtable Crime. He was drawn on a Sledge to the Market-place, attended by my Guards, to prevent his being torn in pieces by the way, and his body hanged by one foot after his head had been cut off, and ſet upon the Poſt in the Market-place. The rage of the multitude, even of Women, was ſo great, that they tore him with their teeth, and the Children ſucked his blood.</p>
            <p>After this I ſhewed my ſelf to the Town, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations and benedictions being redoubled on my account, as well as imprecations againſt the Spaniards. Their condition at this time ſeemed
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:57207:276"/>
altogether deſperate; having neither Victuals nor Credit, nor ſcarely any Troops, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed daily; but a ſhip which unexpectedly came to them from <hi>Malaga,</hi> brought them Four hundred men, commanded By Colonel Don <hi>Alonzo de Monroy.</hi> I on my ſide heard good News every day: All the Towns of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> particularly <hi>Meſſina</hi> and <hi>Palermo,</hi> ſent me aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that they reſolved to follow the example and fortune of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and I received a Letter from the King, by which he congratulated my advantages, and the Peoples Election of me to be Duke of their Republick. I was promiſed the return of the Fleet, which I might expect daily, with Gallies accompanying the Ships, ſo that I could diſcern nothing to be feared, and much to be hoped; and was more confirmed by Cardinal <hi>Filomarini,</hi> who viſiting me on the Eight and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> as ſoon as we were alone in my Chamber, made me a long diſcourſe of the miſeries of a Civil War not yet near an end; of the dangers I had already eſcaped and was yet to undergo: of the jealouſies <hi>France</hi> had of my exaltation, the uncertainty of her ſuccors, and of the arrival of her Fleet, though ſhe gave me daily hope of it; with the aſſurance of the return of that of <hi>Spain,</hi> with conſiderable forces; and how much better it were, by laying hold on a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opportunity, to apply my ſelf to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and ſecure fortune, though ſome-wayes moderated, than to glorious and high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, attended alwayes by much hazard,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:57207:276"/>
and moſt commonly by few or no advantages or profits. I gave ear to all theſe plauſible diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without interrupting him, to diſcover to what ſo long an Oration tended, which ſeemed to have been very ſtudiouſly premeditated: My ſilence encouraged him, and thinking me waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he told me, My Lord, you have it now in your power to make your ſelf the happieſt man of this Age, reſtore quiet to this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Kingdom and all <hi>Italy,</hi> with peace and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to this City, and a ſolid eſtabliſhment to your ſelf, capable of ſatisfying your ambition, which is not only ſo high, but ſo well grounded, that it were not reaſonable to offer to a Perſon of your Birth and Merit, any thing below a Crown; and I am now to preſent one to you: This is no illuſion nor artifice to deceive you; I have Commiſſion from the Pope, Colledge of Cardinals, and all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to tell you they will be ſecurity for the performance of what I am entruſted to propound to you. Firſt of all the Spaniards make you the ſole Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of this Kingdoms differences, for ſettling whoſe Peace, and eſtabliſhing whoſe Crown, which hath been long tottering, they will be obliged to you alone. They will give you <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> the ſtrong places of which (during a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Arms) they will put into your poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; till which be performed, you ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue here in arms, and endeavour to regulate all the affairs of this Kingdom: If what be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to you, be not ſatisfactory, your ſelf
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:57207:277"/>
ſhall make conditions: and if the Spaniards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not what they have promiſed here, you can come from thence with greater force to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt this People; by which both they and you are ſecured, all hazard and dangers remaining on the Spaniards ſide.</p>
            <p>I asked him ſmiling, Whether he were ſure that all he promiſed would be made good? he told me yes, of which if I deſired Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he would ſhew me good Authorities, he not being a perſon to engage in any thing light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor to expoſe himſelf to the hazard of being diſavowed. My Lord, ſaid I, after all theſe fair Propoſals, I expected you ſhould have demanded of me Paſſes for the Spaniards to go away in ſafety, and my Parole (they leaving me the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> in which they can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger maintain themſelves) to ſuffer them peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to enjoy <hi>Sicilia</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of driving them from thence; which I muſt have taken ſome time to have conſidered, before I could have reſolved on; ſuch a Propoſal had been reaſonable and handſom, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change you offer, I ſhall not eaſily condiſcend to. I know to what extremities they are reduced, I expect the French Fleet in a very few dayes, I have Proviſions in abundance, and for more than two year; the Nobility is ready to declare for me, all Provinces apply themſelves to me, and know not what other courſe to take. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſix weeks be over I ſhall receive Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crowns from the Cuſtom-Houſe
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:57207:277"/>
of <hi>Foggia.</hi> I have the value of a Million of Gold, in Silk, Oil, and Salt, drawn from <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria.</hi> I have in all parts above Five and twenty thouſand men, which I can draw together in eight dayes, with great quantities of Powder and Salt-Peter. You may therefore tell them the Conqueſt of this Kingdom is compleated; that this <hi>Campania</hi> will with eaſe make me Maſter of every part of it, by the end of which I will not leave them one ſingle Caſtle; that the next <hi>Campania</hi> I will drive them out of <hi>Sicily</hi>; after which I will not ſatisfie my ſelf by taking <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> from them, but ere two years be over leave them nothing in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>; that all this and more is to be feared from a man, that alone and without any aſſiſtance, hath reduced them to the preſent extremity; and that if they deſire to purchaſe my friendſhip, it muſt be on other conditions than thoſe you have offered me; that nothing can draw me off from the intereſts of <hi>France</hi>; that I will periſh a thouſand times rather than ever prove unfaithful to her; and to conclude, that I love honour too well, to do any thing that may be blameable; and that if I be liable to the temptation of a Crown, it muſt be of a better Kingdom than <hi>Sardinia,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He anſwered, That he was very ſorry to find me ſo much led aſide by my own opinion; and had great apprehenſions for me. I replied, What remains there for me to fear? Can my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies employ againſt me any thing more than Fire, Sword, and Poyſon, which they have
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:57207:278"/>
ſo often unſucceſsfully made uſe of? Indeed my Lord I never forſake a handſome undertaking, when I am once engaged in it; I can but die, and am prepared for it. At my firſt arrival at <hi>Naples</hi> I reſolved either to periſh or deprive them of its Crown. Events are in the hands of God, let him diſpoſe of all according to his pleaſure, and how fatal ſoever the concluſion prove, I will ſee it come without fear or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet; there is no more therefore to be ſaid: and thus our Converſation ending, he returned home, and I went to Maſs, my thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually applied to finiſh what I had ſo happily begun.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> hearing that I had news of the ſpeedy return of the French Fleet, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that (theirs not arriving time enough to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it) they ſhould be cut off from receiving any proviſions by Sea, thought he was to uſe all endeavours to keep <hi>Puzzolo,</hi> on whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation the Caſtle of <hi>Baiae</hi> depended; which having a free Communication with <hi>Capua,</hi> might ſend him refreſhments, if he could force the Suburb of <hi>Chiay,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>La Grotta,</hi> and the Tower of <hi>La Piede de Grotta.</hi> He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked foot on three Gallies, and taking the Baron of <hi>Batteville</hi> with him, viſited <hi>Puzzolo,</hi> and re-inforced the Garriſon, and paſſing to <hi>Nicita,</hi> left a hundred men there, judging rightly that the French Gallies could not ride ſecurely before <hi>Naples,</hi> till the Spring ſhould be more advanced, nor find any ſafe Harbor,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:57207:278"/>
but between the Iſland of <hi>Nicita</hi> and the Point of <hi>Poſilippe.</hi> This put into my head a deſign to attempt it, which I executed a few dayes after.</p>
            <p>In the mean time whileſt <hi>I</hi> was paſſing the Evening of the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> according to my Cuſtom, in anſwering ſuch Petitions as had been preſented me that day, my Servants came to advertiſe me that ſomething extraordinary appeared about the Moon; the curioſity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it might be, obliged me to walk out upon a Terrace that was on the top of my Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, where I could diſcern (the weather being fair and clear, and the Moon right over our heads) a black Circle about a foot broad that environed her, all parts of it equally diſtant from her body; and whoſe Circumference was ſo large, that it ſeemed to encompaſs all my Pallace. Some told me this was a bad Omen, and that they were afraid it portended my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment; I doubted the ſame thing, but concealing my ſuſpition, told them, that the black Circle repreſented the Crown of <hi>Naples</hi> (no longer in its ancient luſtre and beauty, and which the Spaniards ſhould quickly loſe) that it appearing over my head, and vaniſhing (as it did) ſoon after, ſignified that the loſs they were about to make ſhould be to my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>Next Morning as ſoon as I waked, notice was given me that <hi>Cucurulle</hi> the greateſt Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger of <hi>Italy,</hi> deſired to ſpeak with me. I

cauſed him to be admitted, and to ſit down by my Beds-ſide, and he told me, that the Stars having ſignified to him that fortune that had hitherto been ſo favourable to us, began to turn to the Spaniards, he came to deſire my paſs and leave to retire, becauſe as a Student he ſought only repoſe, and avoided all places where he apprehended tumults and diſturbances. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to what he demanded, and queſtioning him about my fortune, he told me that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Sun and Mars threatned me with a very great danger, and were it not that ill influences are mitigated by good ones, that (being the worſt imaginable) had directly ſtruck at my life; but that the Sun in this my revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being in the Tenth Houſe of his Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, caſting a trine Aſpect on the Moon in the Firſt Houſe, mitigated the malignity; and that Mercury having a Sextile of Venus in the Eighth Houſe of Death, ſecured me from any that ſhould be violent; that this therefore was no more than a menace, but that I could not avoid impriſonment, ſince Mars at the time of my Birth was in the Twelfth Houſe, which is a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I anſwered him that this unhappy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, tending only to threaten, and not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my life, I thought its malignity paſſed over the Tenth of <hi>March,</hi> when I ſecured my ſelf from that great Commotion; or at leaſt on the Twenty fifth, when I eſcaped the Conſpiracy of the <hi>Anonciata.</hi> I wiſh it prove ſo with all my heart, ſaid he, but I am afraid that before eight
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:57207:280"/>
dayes paſs you will be a Priſoner; and I diſcern this ſo clearly, that I would venture all I have in the World that it falls out ſo. I have a reſpect (ſaid I) for Aſtrology, but knowing it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, I pleaſe my ſelf with all it tells me to my advantage, and take no alarme at the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils with which it menaces me; and ſince wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudence are more potent than the Stars, I believe I may by precautions avoid the miſchiefs wherewithal they threaten me. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you therefore not to endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſe me, becauſe I am reſolved to believe I have nothing more to fear and very much to hope for. If my wiſhes may have effect (ſaid he) my Opinion ſhall prove erroneous, and yours veritable; but give me leave to retire, and be pleaſed to ſign the Paſs I preſent you: I did what he deſired, and embracing him bid him farewel.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things paſſed, <hi>Vincenzo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea</hi> ſeeing no way to avoid his ruin but by mine, endeavoured it by all means, and durſt no more appear in the Town, hearing of the Order I had given to ſearch him every where, and bring him to me alive or dead, as one of the Principal Confederates of <hi>Cicio Regina,</hi> whom he had corrupted, negotiated his reward, and engaged to attempt my life. <hi>Sebaſtiano Landi</hi> that commanded the Gate of <hi>Alba,</hi> tired by the delay of the French Fleet, which appeared not for all the fair promiſes, wanting money, yielded to ſollicitations, and promiſed to deliver
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:57207:281"/>
the Gate of <hi>Alba</hi> for Five thouſand Crowns. This Treaſon ſurpriſed me, having no ſuſpition of it, he being a perſon I leſs diſtruſted than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>Naples</hi>; having obſerved him to be more zealous, careful, and vigilant in the guard of his Poſt than any other: He could never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of any negligence, and was not only very punctual in his Guards, but kept all his men in ſuch a continual readineſs, that at any hour either of day or night, he had two or three hundred fitted to march whither ſoever I commanded them. <hi>Vincenzo Andrea</hi> having agreed of all things with him, gave advice to Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi>; and <hi>Auguſtino Mollo</hi> having told me that ſome new deſign was on foot, I took ſo much pains to diſcover it, and carefully to obſerve all ſuch as came to our Poſts from the Enemy, that cauſing one called <hi>Ferraro,</hi> who came from them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to be followed, he ran into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins, from whence (finding himſelf purſued) he eſcaped by a back door, which was an effect of my evil fate; for had he been taken, I had made a diſcovery of an enterpriſe the Spaniards undertook out of deſpair, and had avoided the impriſonment wherewithal <hi>Cucurulle</hi> ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively threatned me.</p>
            <p>The Thirtieth of <hi>March</hi> an Expreſs diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Marquiſs of <hi>Velade</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> was brought to me, and I opened his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which imported that all the Neopolitan
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:57207:281"/>
Troops, ran ſo faſt from their Colours, that he could make no ſtate of them; that the Viceroy ſhould therefore endeavour to ſend him more, for elſe it would be impoſſible for him to take the Field, or reſiſt the attempt <hi>France</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make on the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> at leaſt without he ſent him money; that he had not wherewithal to pay his Troops that were ready to mutiny; that ſince the laſt <hi>Campagna</hi> he had received nothing of the Sixty thouſand Crowns a Moneth, that <hi>Naples</hi> had wont to furniſh for preſervation of that Dominion; which being the only Stock he had to maintain the War, he looked on himſelf as loſt without a ſudden reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. I was very glad of this good news, and thinking to give a mortal blow to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> and the Viceroy, by acquainting them with an extremity they knew not how to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (being themſelves generally unprovided of all things) after I had read the Letters I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the Bearer, and let him paſs, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their deſpair, by the knowledge they would find I had, that inſtead of hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſupplies, ſuccors were ſo preſsingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them. They then thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves irrecoverably loſt, and I believed my enterpriſe would quickly be perfected, by the arrival of our Fleet or my Money from <hi>Rome,</hi> either of which had ſecured me from the traiterous ſale of the Gate of <hi>Alba,</hi> which it was impoſsible for me to prevent, having no intelligence of it. I was not ſo blind but I perceived

               </gap>omething was in agitation, which I was very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nduſtrious to diſcover, but in vain. I knew <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenzo Andrea</hi>'s Meſſages ſent by <hi>Gennaro Pinto,</hi> and <hi>Ferraro,</hi> both of which twice eſcaped my hands by miracle; but humane prudence cannot prevail againſt the Decrees of Heaven.</p>
            <p>My intelligence in the Collateral Council, and the Spies I kept amongſt the Enemies ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me faithfully, informed me of a <hi>Junto</hi> (a word the Spaniards uſe for their more ſecret Councils) of War and State that had been held, where all expedients that might probably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ruin were propounded. The firſt was to endeavour to become Maſters of the Town by ſtorming one of its Poſts, which yet appeared impoſsible without ſome Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the Viceroy pretended not to have any; and if this advice ſhould be followed, that very little was to be left to hazard, but that at the firſt oppoſition they ſhould entrench them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without advancing any farther, for fear of being over-powered by the multitude, to whom their forces, not being numerous enough to reſiſt, muſt of neceſsity give place; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was to abandon the Poſts they held in the Town, and (leaving ſome few men in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) to take the field, ſending order to all the forces they had in the Kingdom to joyn with them, and cauſing the Nobility to take horſe, to ſtarve me, by cutting off my proviſions; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving me of all communication, and blocking all the paſſages of <hi>Apulia,</hi> from whence came
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:57207:282"/>
to me ſecurely and without any need of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, as much Corn as I had occaſion for, they themſelves in the mean time being blocked up and in a ſtarving condition. But this ſeemed very difficult to be practiſed, it being doubtful whether the Nobility would obey their Orders, having already made proteſtations of their inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of continuing the War any longer, having neither Money left nor Credit; otherwiſe this expedient ſeemed the beſt and ſureſt, they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving I wanted forces, eſpecially Horſe, to dare to venture out of <hi>Naples,</hi> and give them battel; the inhabitants of that City being good to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Houſes, and fight behind Walls, but not at all fit nor capable to march out and hazard a battel in the Field againſt diſciplined and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Troops. The third, which ſeemed the moſt ſecure, was (leaſt our Fleet ſhould cut them off from Sea, they not having Ships nor Gallies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to engage it, and having no expectation of the return of their Fleet to them in this laſt extremity) to uſe their utmoſt endeavour for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Suburb of <hi>Chiay,</hi> and taking <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero,</hi> with the two Villages of the <hi>Grotta,</hi> ſo to free the paſſage to <hi>Puzzuolo,</hi> which having communication with <hi>Capua,</hi> proviſions might be brought them by land, and all that could be had from <hi>Sardinia, Genoua,</hi> and the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Dominion, landing at <hi>Gaeta,</hi> might be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence to <hi>Capua,</hi> from <hi>Capua</hi> to <hi>Puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zolo,</hi> and from <hi>Puzzuolo</hi> by way of <hi>Chiay</hi> to their Quarters, without any hindrance by our

Army; that by this means they ſhould prevent our attempting <hi>Baiae,</hi> which they could relieve at their pleaſure; beſides all which, the ſeaſon not being yet favourable for Gallies, that thoſe of <hi>France</hi> either would not come, or coming, being unſecure in the Bay, would be forced to retire, wanting both the Haven of <hi>Baiae</hi> and the ſhelter of <hi>Nicita,</hi> of which I ſhould be deprived when they had fortified theſe Poſts. Theſe three deſigns were long deliberated on without any reſult, but plurality of Voices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the laſt; and all the reſolution they took was (in caſe ſuch of the three as they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted ſhould not have ſucceſs) to blow up the Caſtles, and retire to <hi>Capua, Gaeta, Iſchia, Baiae,</hi> and other Maritime places, which they would garriſon with ſuch Troops as they had, and there attend ſupplies from <hi>Spain,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Fleet.</p>
            <p>I received the news of this with a great deal of joy, and conſidering the three Propoſitions, judged the firſt impoſſible, our Poſts which they had ſo often in vain attempted, being ſo well fortified and in ſo good a condition, that I thought I had nothing to fear on that account, not ſuſpecting any Treaſon, nor ſeeing any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it. The ſecond ſeemed no leſs ſo, being aſſured the Nobility would no more take horſe againſt me, believing the Spaniards ruined, and that to arm in their behalf, was to expoſe themſelves to the entire loſs of their fortunes, by making of none effect their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:57207:284"/>
with me; that they would therefore content themſelves to ſit ſtill in expectation of what the Moneth of <hi>April</hi> might produce, to declare on the Firſt of <hi>May,</hi> as they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, on that ſide that ſhould ſeem ſtrongeſt and moſt ſecure. And I thought they would certainly fix on the laſt of the three, which I admire they were ſo long ere they reſolved on; there being no other means of getting Proviſions, and rendering our Fleet uſeleſs: I thought alſo that I was (without loſs of time) to attempt <hi>Nicita,</hi> that I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all pretence of retarding the return of our Gallies, when I ſhould have a ſecure Haven to preſent them. Having ſeriouſly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the neceſſity of inclining to this reſolution, I applied my ſelf to nothing elſe but to put it in execution.</p>

            <p>FRiday the third of <hi>April</hi> I went to viſit the Poſts, cauſed all to be added that I judged wanting, and made them ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible, that Women might without danger have kept them againſt forces much ſtronger than thoſe of our Enemy. I enquired of all Officers what they ſtood in need of, gave them Powder enough, and three dayes advance for ſubſiſtance of their men; recommending to them to be exact in their Guards, and ſerve me with the ſame affection and fidelity they had to that time teſtified, and then thought I might go out of <hi>Naples</hi> without apprehenſion or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger during my abſence. The Gate of <hi>Alba</hi> above all the reſt ſeemed ſo well fortified, that I did not judge any poſsibility of attempting it; and Colonel <hi>Landi,</hi> whom I ever found the moſt careful, faithful, and zealous of my Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſo well confirmed my confidence of him, that I ordered him ſtill to keep men in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as he had wont to do, to ſecond all other Poſts, as they might have occaſion to be re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, after which I went home very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied

Sending for the Peoples Elect, and Captains of the City Quarters, I ordered them to increaſe the weight of Bread and diminiſh its price, ſo to ſecure my ſelf againſt any tumult or ſedition, by contenting the People; and to give me ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy notice of the leaſt alteration that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. I commanded <hi>Onoffrio Piſſacani, Carlo Longobardo, Cicio Battimiello,</hi> and <hi>Mattheo d' Amore,</hi> to viſit our Poſts twice a day, and to be ready to march with their Companies at the leaſt alarme; to make re-inforcements whereſoever they ſhould be neceſſary. I charged <hi>Auguſtino Mollo</hi> to hold a vigilant eye over all <hi>Gennaro</hi>'s actions, to obſerve his Correſpondence with the Enemy, and to give me notice of all that paſſed in <hi>Naples.</hi> I provided Powder (of which I had lately received ſome quantity) for my march the next day, with four Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and five or ſix hundred foot, choſen out of the beſt I had in the Town.</p>
            <p>Saturday the Fourth of <hi>April,</hi> after dinner, I cauſed my Foot and Artillery to march, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken leave of Cardinal <hi>Filomarini,</hi> and made my Prayers before the Head of St. <hi>Genna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> and kiſſed the miraculous Viol of his blood, took Horſe, and followed by my Guards, marched right to <hi>Poſilippo,</hi> and from thence, till my Troops arrived, took a view of the Iſland of <hi>Nicita</hi>: I obſerved there was a Tower in the midſt of it that contained the greateſt part of its Garriſon, and between the Iſland and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:57207:286"/>
on a Stone Arch, or rather the point of a Rock, a Houſe called the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> where ſuch as come from places ſuſpected of infection are obliged to continue forty dayes; that near the Haven there were five or ſix Houſes, in wihch the Enemy had poſted five and twenty or thirty Musketiers, and two Field-pieces, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent landing; that the arm of the Sea between <hi>Niſita</hi> and the Point of <hi>Poſilippo,</hi> which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>de Coroglio,</hi> was not above two hundred pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces over, I reſolved to place two Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non at this Point, by means of ſuch a Battery to diſlodge the Enemy that was poſted in thoſe Houſes, and in Felucca's paſs over ſuch men as I ſhould command to attempt a landing. I cauſed alſo another Battery of two Pieces of Cannon to be made lower at the Sea-ſide, to beat on the Flanck of thoſe Houſes, and drive away the Musketiers that defended the paſſage.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as my men arrived, I ſet them to work on theſe Batteries, and leaving enough to guard my Cannon, night coming on, and no attacque to be made without Felucca's, I order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all to be in a readineſs againſt next morning, contenting my ſelf for that night to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged the Enemy from the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thirty Musketiers there. I went afterwards to ſup and lie at <hi>Poſilippo,</hi> all the inhabitants whereof I commanded to be ready to march with their arms, in caſe of an alarme; having intelligence that the Enemies that night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make themſelves Maſters of <hi>Vomero.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:57207:287"/>The next morning having ſent for ten armed Felucca's, my Cannon played from both Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries at day-break, which had not been fired above twenty times over, before they diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the two Field-pieces the Enemy had in the Iſland. They ſuffered much by my Artillery, which beat down all thoſe little Houſes, and overthrew their <hi>Corps de Gard</hi>: perceiving them in diſorder, I ſent thirty men in Felucca's, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to land under favour of my Cannon, and the continual fire of thirty Musketeers I had lodged in the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> and others from the Point of <hi>Coroglio</hi>: They found ſome reſiſtance, and inclining to come back again, I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sieurs <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Amour</hi> and St. <hi>Andre Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied,</hi> Cornet and Quarter-Maſter of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Light Horſe, with thirty French Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to force a Landing, cauſing them to be followed by thirty or forty Musketeers; St. <hi>Amour</hi> had his right arm broke by a Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, of which he died four dayes after, and two or three of the Horſemen were wounded; but St. <hi>Andre Clapied</hi> leaping aſhore with his Sword in his hand, followed by his men, after a Skirmiſh of half a quarter of an hour, drove the Enemy from thoſe Houſes Being thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Maſter of the Landing place, I ſent an hundred and fifty men to paſs over, who forced the Enemy to retreat to the Tower that is in the middle of the Iſland, to which they had made ſome ſlight Out-works, which were ſtormed with very little reſiſtance: I cauſed my men to be ſeconded, and we lodged at the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:57207:287"/>
foot of the Tower with ſmall loſs. I ſummoned thoſe that were in it, but expecting relief, they refuſed to parly, pretending themſelves to be reſolved and in a condition to defend it.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Gennaro</hi> ſent me a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and his deſires to learn the condition of my little Siege, but not ſo much out of curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this, as to get aſſurance whether I would come back to <hi>Naples</hi> that night, that he might give the Enemy notice, with whom holding Correſpondence, he knew they were to have a Poſt delivered them, and that they would endeavour to enter the Town, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of it. I told his Meſſenger that I hoped to take <hi>Niſita</hi> in two hours, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to return. <hi>John Battiſta Tiradani</hi> Pay-Maſter of my Troops in place of <hi>Nicolo Maria Mannara,</hi> whom, after the death of <hi>Pietro Creſcentio</hi> his Kinſman, I had ſent to command the <hi>Banditi</hi> he had aſſembled in the Province of <hi>Monte-Fuſcolo,</hi> gave me notice, that he had heard at Cardinal <hi>Filomarini</hi>'s, that the Enemy were about ſome attempt, but could get no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular information what it might be, which perſwaded me they would ſeek to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of <hi>Vomero,</hi> and obliged me to a reſolution of ſtaying where I was, that I might be the readier to oppoſe them. Preſently after I received a Note from <hi>Auguſtino Mollo</hi> in the following terms: Naples <hi>concerns you more than a barren Rock, make haſte back or you will loſe it, the Enemy having reſolved to make ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt this night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="500" facs="tcp:57207:288"/>I ſent anſwer I would not fail to return, and ordered him to give out ſo; then I ſent the Knight <hi>de Fourbin</hi> thither to viſit all the Poſts, and ſend me account of their condition, and in caſe of appearance of any alteration, to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe me of it. That he ſhould in the mean time tell every body that I would be there within two or three hours, by ſuch an expectation to keep them to their duty: The people having ſo great a confidence in me, that they thought my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence could remedy any diſorders, and that all muſt of neceſſity prove advantageous to them when I was upon the place. I then cauſed the Tower to be undermined, and attempted to ſet fire on the gates with Bavins, upon which they that were in it demanded to treat, and ſent out hoſtages. The Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> ſent a Gally to relieve them, but the men it would have landed were beaten back by mine, and hearing no more ſhooting went home thinking the Iſle already loſt. The Hoſtages preſented to me deſired they might have good conditions, and I gave them all they pretended, which was that they ſhould march out the next morning at eight a clock, with arms and baggage, provided they were not relieved in the mean time by a Body able to force my men and raiſe the Siege, towards which they were not to contribute, it being neither permitted them to take up arms, nor ſhoot during ſuch a Combat: They were allowed to give the Viceroy intimation of theſe Capitulations, and to that purpoſe I was to ſuffer whomſoever they would encharge with ſuch a Commiſſion to paſs

to him, but I cauſed the Meſſenger to be detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all night at my lodging in <hi>Poſilippo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was then in very great incertainty whether following the advice received from <hi>Auguſtino Mollo</hi> I ſhould return to <hi>Naples</hi> and leave the Officers of <hi>Nicita</hi> in this condition, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended my reſolution till I heard from the Knight <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> ſuppoſing it might be the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies cunning, by falſe alarms to make me give over my Enterpriſe; I therefore reſolved to lie all night in my Batterie, to prevent the arrival of any relief, judging the taking of <hi>Nicita</hi> to be of great importance. I know not whether I ought to impute this reſolution to good or evil fortune, and the more I conſider, the leſs able I I find my ſelf to determine it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gennaro</hi> weary to be any longer incertain of my reſolution, ſent a ſecond time to endeavor to diſcover it, and I was told, in my impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that as he deſired not my return, leſt my preſence might hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their enterpriſe, ſo he wiſhed it that he might certainly kill me, intending at the firſt alarm to ſend ſixſcore Banditi, who pretending to rally about me, ſhould ſhoot me in the fight. Half an hour before day I diſcovered two Gallies making towards <hi>Nicita,</hi> whom I ſaluted with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, which I levelled and fired my ſelf, ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, that one of them being ſhot through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween wind and water, was fain to go off to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and the other had three or four ſlaves killed. I cauſed the Guns to be immediately charged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and did them miſchief with two other ſhot,

which made them turn back, and perſwaded me that <hi>Nicita</hi> was mine, after which nothing could retard the arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, ſince the excuſe of the Gallies wanting a Haven could be alledged no longer.</p>
            <p>The Knight <hi>de Fourbin</hi> had ſent me word in the mean time, that he found all our Poſts and Guards in a better condition than uſual, that our men were all in armes and very reſolute, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the Gate of <hi>Alba,</hi> where Colonel <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtino Landi</hi> appeared more zealous and active than ever; the Captains <hi>Onoffrio Piſſacani, Carlo Longobardo, Mattheo Damore,</hi> and <hi>Cicio Batti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miello</hi> had gone Petrouils the greateſt part of the night through the whole Town: this very much troubled the Enemy, and cauſed them to reſolve if the Rounds continued an hour longer, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the execution of their enterpriſe to another time. But as ſoon as they had notice that they were given over, and by that time <hi>Fourbin</hi> had given me account of the good condition of all things (which very much ſatisfied me) they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Gate of <hi>Alba.</hi> Part of the wall had for eight dayes together been continually waſhed with Vinegar and Brandy, that it might at once be reverſed as it was, and a breach made ſufficient for horſe to paſs; all this was done without noiſe, and <hi>Landi</hi> keeping continually thereabouts, to prevent his mens ſuſpecting any thing (ſo that I could have no intelligence of it) the Enemy entered, and became Maſters of three works without any alarm but at the laſt, where a Captain being killed, the Souldiers that ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:57207:290"/>
fired only three Muskets. As ſoon as the Enemy got into a broad Street they drew up in battallia, and marched ſtreight to <hi>St. Aniello,</hi> which they poſſeſſed. I will not trouble my ſelf to relate the order of their march, nor in what manner they became Maſters of the whole Town, it not being my buſineſs, and they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more than enough divulged it in all their relations: I ſhall only tell that they gave out that I had agreed with them, and was at that inſtant with <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> My abſence made many believe this, by which the People became dejected in ſo extraordinary a manner, that none of them went about to make defence. They continually cried out, Peace! Peace! no more Taxes: Let <hi>Spain</hi> live, and <hi>France</hi> and the ill Government die: and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their handkerchiefs, the women out of the windows anſwered with napkins, and every mans buſineſs was to hide himſelf. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſet Guards in all parts of the Town, and marched to the Vicarie to make themſelves Maſters of it; <hi>Vincenzo d' Andrea</hi> placing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at their head; their next buſineſs was to poſſeſs themſelves of my Palace, where ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was made by my Domeſticks; I cannot forbear to relate here the reſolute action of a young French Tailor, who having fortified himſelf alone in my Chamber, perceiving the door to be broken open upon him, ſhot dead Captain <hi>Don Joſeph Moya</hi> that entered firſt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards giving fire to a barril of powder he found there, he blew up the Roof with ſeven or eight
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:57207:291"/>
of the Enemies, and afterwards leaping out of a window broke both his legs, of which he died two or three dayes after for want of looking to. My Palace was plundered, and the Knight <hi>de Fourbin</hi> having taken horſe at the alarm, and noiſe of the bells of <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> cauſed to be rung as ſoon as they entered, went to get together what men he could, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one called <hi>Chuſin,</hi> to tell me what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who was taken by the way, before he came to me: He met only <hi>Cicio Battimiello,</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four and twenty men that went to guard the Duke of <hi>Turſi,</hi> who was eſcaped before they came, and gotten to <hi>Don John</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Avella,</hi> who received them with much joy, and great teſtimonies of eſteem and friendſhip. <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timiello</hi> with his men got behind a little wall that ſerved as a breſt-work, and the Knight <hi>de Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi>'s horſe falling under him, he forſook him, and before he had gone a hundred paces met a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallion of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and a Squadron of horſe that demanded who he was for, he anſwered the People and his Highneſs, and endeavouring to fire his Piſtols, they both miſſed, whilſt nine or ten Muskets were diſcharged againſt him, one whereof wounded him in his thigh; a Surgeon that had followed him from his lodging ſeeing the Enemies in ſo great numbers ran away, and he perceiving himſelf to be alone and wounded, got to the Arch-biſhops Palace, where finding the door open, he bolted it after him. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> went about to fire it, but a Prieſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in accidentally opened it for them, <hi>Fourbin</hi>
               <pb n="505" facs="tcp:57207:291"/>
then going about to defend himſelf with his Sword, the Officers offered him quarter, which (being ſurrounded with a hundred men) he was forced to accept of. <hi>Matheo d' Amore,</hi> gallant and faithful, with thirty Souldiers of his Company ran valiantly to the alarm, and meeting three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Spaniards,</hi> gave no anſwer to their <hi>Who are you for,</hi> but <hi>his Highneſe and the People,</hi> and refuſing quarter (crying out he would die for me and his Country) was ſlain fighting, after he had been wounded by ſeven or eght Musket-ſhot; a death too glorious for a man of ſo mean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent.</p>
            <p>All their Troops being by ſeveral paſſages ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Market-place, <hi>Don John</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> prayed Cardinal <hi>Filomarini,</hi> that was come to them, to go to <hi>Gennaro,</hi> and give him their parole for his ſecurity, and the punctual performance of all that had been promiſed him, and ſending three hundred men to poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Carmelites Tower, in this manner recovered <hi>Naples,</hi> without reſiſtance, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without any any effuſion of blood, incited by deſpair, which caſt them upon an enterpriſe, of which they expected not any good ſucceſs, reſolved (had it failed) to have abandoned the Caſtles the next day, and have retired to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rime Towns there to wait for ſupplies from <hi>Spain,</hi> having proviſions left them but for four and twenty hours, and no hope of relief from any part. This they often acknowleged to me in the time of my impriſonment.</p>
            <p>Whilſt all theſe things paſſed I (without any
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:57207:292"/>
knowledge of them) attended the marching out of the Garriſon of <hi>Nicita,</hi> till the Adjutant of <hi>Landi</hi>'s Regiment came to tell me that the Poſt of <hi>Alba</hi> was taken, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entred the Town; which he did ſo loud, and in ſo deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an accent, that I had like to have cauſed him to have been killed to prevent his diſcouraging my Troops, as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> did at the Battail of <hi>Newport,</hi> to him that in the morning brought him news of the defeat of his Van. I immediately ordered Colonel <hi>Meloni</hi> to draw off the men I had in the Iſle of <hi>Nicita,</hi> and put the reſt in order to follow me, going before my ſelf to ſee if there were any poſſibility of giving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to ſo great and unexpected a miſchief. I croſſed through the Town of <hi>Poſſilippo,</hi> where I found all the Inhabitants in tears and a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal aſhoniſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cauſed them to recover their courage, and reaſſume their arms, and marching towards <hi>Vomero</hi> perceived the Souldiers had abandoned ther Poſt, and prepared to be gone: and they ſeemed to me to conſult whether they ſhould not fire upon me. I rid up to them, and demanding whither they went, they told me they thought of nothing but ſecuring themſelves ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were become Maſters of <hi>Naples.</hi> I told them it was a falſe report, and commanded them to their quarter; that there had indeed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſome diſorder in the Town, but that I was going to put an end to it by my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Upon the firſt report I had ſent the Sieur <hi>de la Bottellerie,</hi> one of my Field-Adjutants to
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:57207:292"/>
ſee what paſſed, and return to give me account, to which purpoſe I ſent two of my Guards with him, that he might diſpatch them one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, till he himſelf had made a nearer diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the matter: He paſſed by the Schools, and advancing as far as <hi>St. Gennaros</hi> Gate, perceived a Battaglion of the Enemy, and that all the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Suburbs had already rendred to them; in his return to make me this ſad report, his bridle was laid hold on, and his Cane ſnatched from him; but making his way with his piſtol in his hand, he haſtened back to me as faſt as his horſe could run, ſeeing in his way the heads of my two Guards that he had ſent before him. I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him that I could not that way get into the Town, and met <hi>Marco de Lorenzo,</hi> that had great kindneſs for me, who cried out poor Prince flye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are loſt, you have been betrayed, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are Maſters of the Town, I go home to endeavour to ſecure my houſe from plundering, then weeping and embracing me, galloped away.</p>
            <p>The Knight <hi>des Eſſars</hi> propounded to me me to return to <hi>Poſſilippo,</hi> there to get Felucca's to carry me to <hi>Rome.</hi> I looked angirly on him and told him, till now I ever thought you my friend, but I find the contrary: there remains no more to be thought on, but to die with our ſwords in our hands; and I ſwear that if any be hereafter ſo bold as to mention an eſcape to me, I will run my ſword through him. I ſtruck into the field to fetch a compaſs about the <hi>Virgins Suburbs,</hi> and endeavor to get into the Town
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:57207:293"/>
by the Gate of <hi>Nola,</hi> and paſſing a deep way between two high banks, ſaw a very ill looking fellow on the top of one of them, with fourteen or fifteen Muskteers, who asked me for his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not knowing me becauſe my Cloak was thrown over my face. I asked what his buſineſs was with him? he anſwered, pay him my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and kiſs his feet: I replied he was coming behind, and kept on my way: the fellow ſoon after ſeeing a Captain of horſe called <hi>la Breche,</hi> with a Buffcoat, and Sleeves and Breeches em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with gold, cauſed five or ſix Muskets to be fired at him, by which both he and his horſe were killed. Having recovered the plain, I rid ſtreight to the gate of <hi>Nola,</hi> which I found to be in the Enemies poſſeſſion, and turning towards the entrance of <hi>St. Anthonies</hi> Suburb I met two Gipſies, who told me that the Gate of <hi>Capua</hi> was not only taken, but that I ſhould find Musketeers at the Barricado that was at the entrance into the Suburbs. I reſolved to ſee whether they told me truth, and was quickly confirmed by a voley as ſoon as I came near it. I thought it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Enemy might not be advanced ſo far as the Market-place, and that paſſing through the Suburb of <hi>Loretto,</hi> and entring by the Gate that is under the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Tower, by rallying ſome of the people, I might either die at their head, or repell the Enemy, cauſing by my preſence all the Inhabitants to take arms, and the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation of the whole Town to ceaſe, by means of their confidence in me: but coming to the Suburb of <hi>Lorettto,</hi> I ſaw ſeven or eight <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
               <pb n="509" facs="tcp:57207:293"/>
Colours planted on the top of the <hi>Carmelites Tower,</hi> by which underſtanding my misfortune to be irrecoverable, I reſolved to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards St. <hi>Maries</hi> of <hi>Capua,</hi> to diſ-engage the Sieur <hi>de Mallet,</hi> and rallying all the Troops he commanded, endeavour to paſs the River <hi>Voltorno</hi> near <hi>Caiazzo,</hi> where I had a Garriſon, to go from thence into <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> to joyn with the Troops that carried on the War there by my Commiſſions.</p>
            <p>Some Neapolitans propounded to me to take the way of <hi>Benevento,</hi> from whence I might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards paſs to any part of the Realm I ſhould chuſe, but I was not of this Opinion, judging that the Enemies had poſſeſſed themſelves of the Streights of <hi>La Cerra,</hi> by which they might probably expect I would paſs. All that were with me began by degrees to go away and ſhift for themſelves; the Abbot <hi>Laudati</hi> was ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to provide himſelf of a ſafe retreat; <hi>Jomo St. Apollino,</hi> the Maſter of my Horſe, returned to <hi>Naples,</hi> on a very fair Courſer he rid, hoping not only to obtain indempnity but a good recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by preſenting him to Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</hi> My Neapolitan Guards ſlipped away one after another, after they had thrown their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours into a Ditch; and before I had rid two Leagues, one half of the Sixſcore Horſe that had attended me, left me.</p>
            <p>Coming in ſight of <hi>Juliana,</hi> I thought not good to take the way of <hi>Averſa,</hi> diſtruſting <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> that was Governor; and having left my men about five hundred paces from <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
               <pb n="510" facs="tcp:57207:294"/>
whileſt I rid alone very well mounted to enquire whereabouts I might paſs a little Brook, I heard the noiſe of a fierce skirmiſh, and met the Nephew of <hi>Jacomo Roſſo,</hi> who told me that his Uncle a ſworn enemy of <hi>John Andrea,</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and Head of the People of that Town, a man couragious and reſolute, was gone with ſeven or eight hundred men he had drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to kill him, he having revolted to the Enemy; that his Uncle had already forced two Houſes, where he had ſlain ſome of thoſe that oppoſed him, and amongſt the reſt cut off the head of Captain <hi>Tullo, John Andrea</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law, whom he had beſieged in his Houſe, which he vigorouſly defended. I told him that I was very glad his Uncle in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner executed my Orders, that he ſhould make ſure to take him dead or alive, that he might be puniſhed for his many Crimes, making a ſhew that he acted by my Order, and the other (of whoſe fidelity I was aſſured) in oppoſition to me. He asked me if the report were true that the Spaniards were Maſters of <hi>Naples,</hi> of which they had notice by the ringing of all the Bells of the Town. I told him it was true that by means of ſome Correſpondence, they had been let in at the Gate of <hi>Alba,</hi> and advanced as far as the Schools; but that I arriving with Troops from <hi>Poſilippo,</hi> had beat them back, and forced them to forſake the Town, with loſs of many of their men; for joy whereof I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Bells to be rung. He asked whither I went? I anſwered him that the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:57207:294"/>
greateſt part of the Garriſon of <hi>Capua</hi> being marched out on ſome enterpriſe, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple taking arms had driven the remainder into the Caſtle; that they had ſent me word of this, that I might come and take poſſeſſion of the Town, which they would not deliver but into my own hands, for fear my Troops might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome violences, which my preſence would prevent; that for that reaſon I came ſo ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied, that I might arrive the ſooner; and ſince I intended not to go to <hi>Averſa,</hi> where I knew I ſhould be obliged to ſtay ſome hours, I told him he would do me a pleaſure to ſhew me where I might paſs the River. He pointed to a little Village on my right hand, where was a Bridge hard by a Mill. I ordered him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Uncle with the good news I had told him, and returning to my men, went forward, very glad to have been informed of the way I was to follow.</p>
            <p>As I paſſed through this little Village, I was met by a Countryman that knew me, who preſently carried news of it to <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Averſa,</hi> which perſwaded him of the truth of the report that the Spaniards had entred <hi>Naples</hi>; he therefore writ immediately of it to Don <hi>Lewis Poderico,</hi> that commanded in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua,</hi> and that if he ſent to ſecure the paſſages of <hi>Voltorno,</hi> he muſt needs take me Priſoner, that being the way I took for my eſcape; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs I was fain to take to avoid paſſing by <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> gave him time enough to ſend this diſpatch by an Officer he confided in, accompanied by
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:57207:295"/>
three other perſons. As ſoon as I got into the great rode to <hi>Capua,</hi> diſcovering at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance four men a horſe-back that went before me, I took along three of the beſt mounted of my followers, and having commanded them, (obſerving me very well) to do in all things like me, galloped after and quickly over-took them, and my ſelf riding ſide by ſide with the Officer, each of my followers in like manner accoſted his man. I enquired what news at <hi>Averſa,</hi> and after a little diſcourſe ſurpriſing him, clapped my Piſtol at his head, and commanded him to alight, every one of my followers doing the like to every one of his Companions; I made him confeſs that <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi> had ſent him to Don <hi>Lewis Poderico,</hi> with Letters, which he delivered to me. As ſoon as the reſt of my men came up, I cauſed all the four to be ſearched, to ſee if they had any more Letters than thoſe they had given me. I would not ſuffer them to be killed, but to prevent their carrying any news of me, cauſed them to be bound hand and foot, and thrown into one of the Ditches on the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-ſide. I commanded ſuch of my men as were worſt mounted to take their horſes, and cauſing thoſe that were left to be ham-ſtringed, rid towards St. <hi>Maries</hi> of <hi>Capua</hi>; being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the news of the ſurpriſal of <hi>Naples</hi> could not be arrived there, and that I muſt needs ſee and ſecure any Meſſenger that ſhould paſs by to carry it.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I came within a quarter of a league of St. <hi>Maries,</hi> I ſent the Sieur <hi>de Bottillerie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:57207:295"/>
to deſire the Sieur <hi>de Mallet</hi> to meet me, becauſe I had ſomething of very great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nnce to acquaint him with. He could not ſo readily obey this Summons, by reaſon of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot Skirmiſh at that time between our Horſe and thoſe of <hi>Capua.</hi> The Sieur <hi>de l' Iſola</hi> a Neopolitan, that had quitted his employment in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> to come to me, hoping to obtain pardon by bringing news of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, being mounted on a very fair Courſer of mine, leaped a great Ditch that was on the left hand of our way, and deſired my permiſſion to ride up to two of the Enemies Centries, which appeared on a little Hill, which I granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would have been to no purpoſe to have forbidden it. He was the cauſe, by the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he gave, that Horſe were ſent to follow me, and Orders to all Villages on my way, to take arms againſt me; and that the Prince of <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> was ordered with his Company of Dragoons to poſſeſs himſelf of the Paſs of the Ferry. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronimo Fabrani</hi> my Secretary, went into St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of <hi>Capua</hi> ſo affrighted and beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that it was very diſcernable he brought ill news.</p>
            <p>The Sieur <hi>de Mallet</hi> at our meeting acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me that our Troops being engaged againſt the Enemy, it would be very hard to draw them off, without obliging them to follow me; that it was therefore beſt whileſt they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, to get over by the Ferry before it were ſeiſed on. I commanded two Captains of Horſe that accompanied him, whoſe Troops were in
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:57207:296"/>
their Quarters, to cauſe them to mount and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me; and the Sieur <hi>de Mallet</hi> ſerving us for Guide, we took the way to the River. As we came near the Caſtle of <hi>Caſerta</hi> I perceived a Squadron of Horſe come out of a Wood that was on our left hand, and immediately put all the men I had with me in order, who made not above five and forty or fifty Horſe, the reſt having left me; and perceiving the gray horſe I rid to be weary, who at his beſt was not very fleet, I gave him to the Baron of <hi>Rouvron,</hi> and taking another on which he rid, very good and extraordinary ſwift, rid up to view the Squadron that came towards us. As ſoon as I came within thirty paces of it, the Officer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards me with his hat in his hand, telling me that was the Company of <hi>Cicio Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingere,</hi> General of our Horſe, whoſe Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he was, who had commanded him to take horſe according to my Orders, and that he came to know what I had to command him. I told him he ſhould follow me as a Rear-Guard. This Company had already revolted from us, and the Officer advanced to me on no other account but to prevent my ſeeing an Adjutant of the Enemies called <hi>Battimiello,</hi> who rid at its head, but at my approach fell back into the firſt Rank.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I was returned to my men, I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to march, and after half an hour (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending a very ſteep and ſtony hill, hard by a Village called <hi>Morana</hi>) heard ſome behind me cry <hi>Kill, Kill,</hi> and looking back, perceived that
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:57207:296"/>
the Company that brought up my Rear charged me with Sword and Piſtol, diſcovering three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Squadrons of Horſe on the top of the hill, I called to my men to gallop as hard as they could out of that narrow and difficult way, to gain a Medow I ſaw at the foot of it, where caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off my Cloak I drew them up, and charging the Enemy that purſued me diſorderly, routed them, and whileſt they rallied having diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great Ditch about a thouſand paces from thence, we leaped it and placed ourſelves in a Body on the other ſide, charging the Enemy as he attempted to come over to us, and having diſordered them in the like manner as before, we got over another Ditch, this Countrey being cut off by frequent Ditches and Torrents, ſtill turning head as ſoon as we had paſſed any of them, and having diſordered the Enemy get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to another; in ſuch a manner making our retreat three quarters of a league. At laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Bank covered with ſtubbed Wood, where we muſt needs fall into a File, and having on our left hand a Hedge lined with thirty Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, I thought that coming hindmoſt I could not eſcape their Volly; wherefore caſting the Bridle on my Horſe neck, and taking my two Piſtols in my two hands, I rid right up to them, to cauſe them to fire with greater precipitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſucceeded according to my expectation, for firing all at once and very high, the Bullets paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over my head, hurting only two of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of thoſe that rid laſt and one horſe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this we advanced another half league, the
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:57207:297"/>
Enemy ſtill preſſing upon us, and we defending our ſelves as before: In the mean time the Countrey was raiſed, by ringing the Bells of all the Villages, and the Countrey people poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves of all Paſſes, we could neither come near hedge nor buſh without being fired on. We were to paſs through a Medow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with a little ditch, and a hedge lined with Countrey people, which was very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; the men had lain under contribution of the Sieur <hi>de Mallet,</hi> and knowing him and calling by his name, deſired him to come and alight and ſpeak with them. He pray'd us to ride on as faſt as we could, whileſt he amuſed them, and (a grey Mare he rid being very good and very ſwift) overtook us. The Horſe that followed us, told all the Countrey people they met that we were French Traytors, that were making our eſcape after we had plundered the Countrey, that they ought not to give us Quarter, and commanding them to fire upon the Sieur <hi>de Mallet,</hi> that rid from them as faſt as he could, they broke one of his Mares legs, which fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he finding no poſſibility of recovering himſelf. Hearing this, I cried out, it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome to ſuffer ſo gallant a man to be loſt, that had ſacrificed himſelf for us, and that ſuch as had honour ſhould follow me to diſ-engage him, which I did with but five to accompany me; when I came within twenty paces of him, the Knight <hi>de la Viſſeclette</hi> ſeeing him on the ground without motion, told me he was dead, and that therefore it was to no purpoſe for us to
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:57207:297"/>
hazard our ſelves, and that we loſt a great deal of time. The Country people having indeed gained time to charge again, fired upon us and hurt ſome of our horſes, and mine amongſt the reſt; I know not whether it was by a ſhot of the Carabine of <hi>Viſconti,</hi> Lieutenant to the Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſiers of <hi>Don Diego de Cordoua,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Enemies Scouts, or by a Musket-ſhot of thoſe Country people.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs here relate the propoſal made me by the Marquis <hi>de Chaban</hi> and the Knight <hi>de la Viſſeclette</hi> to ſtay both of them to make good ſome of the Paſſes, to gain me time for my eſcape: Though they preſſed this very much I would never conſent, and told them that I had not ſo great a value for my life, as to preſerve it by the abandoning two ſo brave and generous perſons, and that I would either die with them, or they ſhould eſcape with me.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Country being very much incloſed with ditches and hedges lined with Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers, we were fain to paſs through a diſcharge they made upon us. The Baron of <hi>Rovrou</hi>'s horſe was ſhot through the rains, which obliged him to leave him, and creeping into a hedg cover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over with leaves, and almoſt enterr him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to avoid the Country people: The Sieur <hi>de Graville</hi> received a bullet on the crupper of his Saddle, that ſo much drained his rains, and made ſo great a confuſion, that he a great while thought he had been ſhot. The horſe of the Sieur <hi>Miniere,</hi> a young man of <hi>Paris,</hi> fell into a ditch, and his Maſter uſing no endeavor to get
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:57207:298"/>
him out, followed us a foot with ſo great appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, that he became diſtracted, and (nothing prevailing to recover him) died mad: He cried out to me that the enemie purſued him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought me to command ſome one or other to alight and give him his horſe: I told him all the curteſie I could do him was to cauſe another to take him up behind him; which I commanded the Sieur <hi>de Bar</hi> to do, who rid a great bay Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the race of the <hi>Stilliani.</hi> The horſe of the Sieur <hi>de la Chaiſe</hi> being ſhot, fell, but he raiſed him again by ſpurring him in the buttock, and leaping upon him endeavored to follow me. Then the Sieur <hi>de Mareſts,</hi> one of the Canons of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Liege,</hi> my Almoner, came up to me to know if I would be confeſſed: I anſwered him it was too ſoon, and that I had yet a great many other things to do. A black Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh horſe of the Knight <hi>des Eſſars</hi> had loſt all his ſhooes, as his Maſter ſaid, by riding ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to diſcover the paſſes. We were now come to the Marſhes, and wanted but a quarter of a league to the river and ſafety; our Troop by reaſon of ſuch as fled and died could not make above five and twenty horſe, when mine was ſhot into the body with a Musket, which made him fall to the ground, yet I got him up, but found he had not ſtrength to ſupport himſelf. Turning then to my Company, I told them, you ſee Gentlmen we can do no more, all our horſes are lame or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red let us joyn in a Body and dying handſomely, ſell our lives as dear as we can; we are purſued by five or ſix hundred horſe, all the wayes are
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:57207:298"/>
flanked by foot, and all the paſſes cut off: then turning to the Sieur <hi>de la Chaiſe,</hi> go ſaid I and demand of the Enemies if they will give us good quarter, if ſo, we muſt accept it, if not, let them know they ſhall not kill us ſo eaſily as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. He had no ſooner ſpoke to them but they cried out <hi>All manner of civiltiy and good quarter.</hi> I asked if there were an Officer, becauſe I would not yield to any other. <hi>Viſconti</hi> a Lieutenant of Cuiraſſiers advancing to ſpeak to me, a Country fellow, fired his Musket within ten paces of me, crying <hi>No quarter.</hi> I would have rid up to him with my ſword, but my horſe was ſo weak that he ſunck into the mire, and I had much adoe to get him out; the Country fellow ran into a Wood, and <hi>Viſconti</hi> firing his Carabine at him miſſed him. Coming back to me we began to parly, when two men arrived, one of them on a gray horſe with a black Velvet Coat, the other in Mourning on a bay. <hi>Viſconti</hi> told me that one of them was <hi>Carlo de Falco,</hi> and the other <hi>Don Fernando de Montalvo,</hi> Couſin to the late Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>St. Juliana,</hi> ſlain at the skirmiſh of <hi>Averſa</hi>; that they were both Captains, and therefore his authority ceaſed. I offered them my Sword, but they told me they had too great reſpect for me to diſarm me, and that they would have preſented me theirs, if mine had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been loſt or broken. I offered them my Piſtols, which they refuſed, telling me they would not take them till I alighted. But each of them deſiring ſome token that I had rendered my ſelf to them, I gave them two ribbands out of
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:57207:299"/>
my hat, one green, the other Iſabella. I deſired them to ſecure ſuch as were with me from being ill uſed or plundered, which was punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. They took only their Swords, and not viſiting their pockets they might have kept their money, had not they themſelves very much preſſed an acceptance of it. The Knight <hi>des Eſſars</hi> had a Croſs of Diamonds worth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns, which he let fall into the field, and was very much troubled next morning after he had ſent to ſeek it to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Baron of <hi>Gouland,</hi> Colonel of the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundian</hi> horſe, came in quickly after, with <hi>Don Proſpero Tuttavilla,</hi> who commanded the Party; as alſo <hi>Don Joſeph Caetano,</hi> and three or four other Gentlemen, who offered me many civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with another horſe, mine own being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſtand any longer. I gave them thanks, telling them, that he had done me ſo good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that I ſhould be glad not to a light from him, but that he might die between my legs; that my haſte was not ſo great to go to priſon, and that how preſſing ſoever their occaſions might be I knew they would not leave me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. They could not forbear laughing at this anſwer. The Knight <hi>de la Viſſeclete</hi> mounted on a vigorous Courſer which he had preſented me, and I refuſed, becauſe he was reſtie, and would never leave his company, told me (whilſt I was in the middle of theſe Gentlemen) that as long as he thought my life in danger he forſook me nor, and ſtaid to have died with me; but ſeeing that ſecured, and thinking he might be more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:57207:299"/>
to my ſervice at libery than in priſon, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to eſcape, and ſpurring his horſe, which contrary to cuſtom ſtarted freely, and with an incredible ſwiftneſs, though followed by above fifty horſemen eſcaped them, and alighted a league off, where he cut off his hair, and getting to a Convent of Capuchins, put on one of their habits which was charitably given him, and in that equipage had the good luck to get to <hi>Rome.</hi> Three other perſons that attempted the ſame thing were ſlain by the Peaſants. I was brought to <hi>Capua,</hi> with the Sieur <hi>Marſilli,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Bollonois,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Scopa</hi> an Italian Prieſt, that had cauſed the Duke of <hi>Turſi</hi> to be taken, with ſeventeen Frenchmen, who were the Knight <hi>des Eſſars,</hi> the Baron <hi>de Cauſans,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Chabans, de Canherou, de la Chaiſe, d'Eureux, de la Botelerie, de Souillac, de Bar, de Beauchamp, Larche, de Graville, de Minieres, Compagnon</hi> my Steward, <hi>Deſmareſts</hi> my Almoner, <hi>Branion</hi> my Surgeon, and <hi>Dominico</hi> my Chamberlain.</p>
            <p>After we had rid a league, thoſe Gentlemen asked me if I would drink, and eat a bit of bread with ſome fruit, which I readily accepted being very dry. <hi>Joſeph Scopa</hi> ſenſible they ſpared him but in order to hang him, with an hundred Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins that he had about him deboiſed a <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Horſeman, that willing to go for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was glad of ſuch an occaſion, and faithfully conducted to <hi>Rome.</hi> We heard a noiſe in a Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and as ſoon as the dore of it was opened, (not without great joy) I ſaw the Sieur <hi>de Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> come forth, whom believing dead I had moſt
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:57207:300"/>
paſſionately lamented, as one that had endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſave my life and liberty. I tenderly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, the Gentlemen whoſe Priſoner I was doing the like, having had a very great kindneſs for him ever ſince the Conference they held with him. I deſired to hear his adventure; and he told me that his horſe having been kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and falling upon him, he counterfeited himſelf dead to eſcape the furie of the Peaſants, till ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Officer of his acquaintance paſs by, he rendred himſelf to him, who brought him to the place where we had found him. We paſſed the way in diſcourſe very gallant and pleaſant, <hi>Don Joſeph Caetano</hi> going before with a naked ſword, and cauſing all the Peaſants to crie <hi>Viva la Spagna:</hi> I could not but vex my ſelf to hear theſe Raſcals lament they had miſſed carrying my head to <hi>Naples,</hi> imagining to have gotten a conſiderable ſumme for it, though it made my il fortune very ſupportable, in that I was fallen into the hands of people of quality.</p>
            <p>By that time I came within a mile of <hi>Capua</hi> it was night, where I found <hi>Don Lewis Poderico</hi> with torches and a Coach to receive me; he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to meet me, and as I did the like, my foot was no ſooner out of the ſtirrup but a trembling ſeiſed my horſe, after which he fell dead at the Boot of the Coach. Many embraces having p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between us, we took Coach, and I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into <hi>Capua,</hi> not as a Priſoner, but with all honors I could have expected if I had made my entrance as Maſter of it. Monſieur <hi>de Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derico</hi> brought me to his Houſe, before his door
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:57207:300"/>
I found a Company of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> foot; he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me the Captain, and afterwards all the Gentry and Officers of his Troops, and having brought me to my Chamber, cauſed the Captain to ſtay at the door, that he might not be troubleſome: he asked whether I would ſup privately or in company, and leaving it to his choice, he ſaid if it were acceptable to me, the chief of the Nobility would be overjoyed to wait on me. After this he told me he thought I would be glad to enjoy ſome privacy and refreſh my ſelf, that if I would write any Letters concerning my particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he would ſend them away that very night by an expreſs, to what part ſoever I deſired; then taking his leave, and none but Frenchmen remaining with me, he ſent me Paper and Ink, and ordered a fire to be made: and as ſoon as he came down cauſed to be proclaimed, that all Frenchmen that could be met with ſhould be brought to <hi>Capua,</hi> not miſuſed nor ſtript on pain of death: he ordered a liſt to be taken of all Priſoners, and lodged the Gentlemen amongſt the beſt of the Nobility, and the reſt by billet, allotting each of them a Centry to follw them, that ſo they might viſit one another, and come to me as often as I pleaſed. Every man ſought to give good entertainment to his Priſoner, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with emulation who ſhould pay them grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reſpect and civility. As ſoon as I found my ſelf alone, my firſt care was to burn a Letter I had received in the morning, which if taken would have coſt the lives of many perſons of quality, and which I durſt not tear leſt the
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:57207:301"/>
pieces might have been recollected. Then I writ to <hi>Rome</hi> for money, with the account of my misfortune, and ſome Letters into <hi>France,</hi> after the ſtile of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt when he was taken priſoner at <hi>Pavia,</hi> that I had loſt all but my life and honor. I ſent them open by the Knight <hi>des Eſſars</hi> to <hi>Don Lewis Poderico,</hi> with my ſeal to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe them when he ſhould have peruſed them, but he would not look on them, and immediately ſealing them, ſent them away by an Expreſs to <hi>Rome.</hi> We uſed the Paper that remained to make Lampoons on our misfortune, and ſuch as had ſhewn moſt fear: all that were taken with me can bear witneſs, that no alteration could ever be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in my countenance, neither in my retreat, whilſt I was taken priſoner, nor during the time I was at <hi>Naples,</hi> the different accidents of my good or evil fortune never giving me any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, acting continually with as much tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity as if I had been no wayes concerned: which is rather to be attributed to a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, than to a conſtancy of reſolution that armed me againſt all events.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Don Lewis Poderico</hi> ſent to know whether he ſhould not incommode me by a viſit, and having returned, that he ſhould do me a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great favour, he came followed by many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality: he firſt ſignified his ſorrow that his reſpects were to be paid me on ſo diſpleaſing an occaſion, and that he was no leſs ſenſible of my misfortune than I could be my ſelf; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that men that wear ſwords, being ever liable to ſuch accidents, ought not to be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:57207:301"/>
at them: that good and ill ſucceſs depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more on fortune than merit, perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and courage that are above her ſhould never be concerned in her inconſtancy: that my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſorrow for my impriſonment was, that I was no longer in a condition to be uſeful to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Neapolitan Nobility, which I prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red above my own, and that my only conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the good uſage I received from them, being naturally pleaſed to have obligation to perſons I eſteemed, and paſſionately deſired to ſerve. Some of the Company replyed, that though I was to be pittyed, they themſelves were much more ſo, becauſe my loſs of liberty brought them into fetters, much heavier than they had ever been loden with. <hi>Don Lewis Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derico</hi> interrupting this diſcourſe, told me, That having received no order from <hi>Naples</hi> to ſecure me, nor yet any advice of what had happened, at the time of my arrival at St. <hi>Maries</hi> of <hi>Capua,</hi> if I had ſent him a Trumpet to have deſired to paſs into the Popes Territorie, he ſhould not only have granted it, but himſelf with all the Nobility would have accompanied me thither, and after he had given me his word, no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould have been ſufficient to have made him break it. We had notice that Supper was ſerved in, which obliged us to go and take out places.</p>
            <p>All were very pleaſant at Supper, and now and then rallyed the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> whom I excuſed on pretence of their natural inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and declaring my true meaning, ſaid, that
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:57207:302"/>
though I had a kindneſs for them, my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ever was to have reſtored order, and brought them under the authority of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as they had been formerly, and as was juſt and reaſonable: that my preſent misfortune happened to me becauſe ſo few Gentlemen had declared on my ſide: That I had ſo great a value for thoſe of that Kingdom, that I aſſured my ſelf if I could once have appeared at the head of them, I ſhould no longer have apprehended the power of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor have feared all <hi>Europe</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. All thoſe Gentlemen obliged by my eſteem and good opinion returned their thanks, as well for my care in preſerving their Eſtates and Houſes from plundering, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their relations from the peoples inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies during the time of my command. After this, glaſſes were called for, and my health cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly drunk, and our wines being the beſt in the world, we ſat long at Table, with a great dealth of mirth, freedom, and reciprocal teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of eſteem and friendſhip. Some of them told me, that ſince my life and honor were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, I was to hope, that fortune who is only conſtant in inconſtancy, (her diſpleaſure being now over) would become favorable to me: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that this world being fitly reſembled to a Play, the firſt Act of mine was begun with a good cudgelling, as is ordinary in <hi>Italian</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; but that I hoped I might come again upon the Stage with different ſucceſs, and before I died make my ſelf conſiderable in <hi>Europe,</hi> by acquiring ſome eſteem, and perhaps ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:57207:302"/>
Theſe diſcourſes held on both ſides, with very little circumſpection, were reported to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who interpreting them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their jealous humor, redoubled their ſuſpitions of a very great underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and the Nobility; which went ſo far, that they believed they had twice aſſembled to deliberate whether they ſhould ſet me at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and whether it were not their intereſt, as ſoon as the French Fleet ſhould arrive, to declare and place me at their head? This was often told me in the time of my impriſonment as well at <hi>Gaeta</hi> as in <hi>Spain,</hi> and I in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to diſ-abuſe them of an imagination as ridiculous as improbable.</p>
            <p>After Supper they all brought me to my Chamber, where new diſcourſe began, and rallying Don <hi>Lewis Poderico,</hi> I told him I was to make him many excuſes, for having ſo long delayed the delivery of a Letter I had for him, and more for the boldneſs I had taken to open it, which yet might be pardonable in a perſon naturally of ſo great curioſity as my ſelf. I then gave him <hi>Pepe Palombe</hi>'s Letter that was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, which I had taken from his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on the way. He read it aloud, and ſmiling told me, he expected not that I ſhould have been the Bearer of ſuch news; that that of my retreat had been brought him by one called <hi>l' Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>la,</hi> thinking ſo to ſave his life, which he the more deſerved to loſe, by being unfaithful to both ſides; that he had been an Officer in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> which ſervice he deſerted on report
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:57207:303"/>
of the diſorders of <hi>Naples,</hi> and went to me, whom now he had betrayed, that he might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain return to the ſervice of <hi>Spain</hi>; but it being juſt to take advantage of treaſon without loving the Traitor, he had accepted his intelligence, which yet ſhould not ſave him from hanging, ſo to revenge both of us; me of a Traitor, and himſelf of a Runnaway. This had a general approbation, and there was not any in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that did not ſolicite his execution inſtead of interceding for his pardon.</p>
            <p>After this ſomething happened very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; <hi>Hieronimo Fabrani,</hi> my Secretary, of all the men in the world the moſt avaricious, more concerned for the loſs of his money than liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and almoſt diſtracted, beſought me in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all thoſe Gentlemen to write to deſire Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> to cauſe twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Chequines that had been taken from him, to be reſtored I anſwered him laughing, that before I ſo far hazarded my credit, I thought beſt to try him in ſomething of leſs importance, becauſe I loved not to expoſe my ſelf to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of a denial; but that to deal freely with him, I thought his fear had made him mad, ſince he forgot that ten or twelve dayes before, when I would have borrowed only half this ſum, which might have ſecured us both againſt our preſent misfortune, he told me he had no money, and believing he durſt not tell me a lie, I ſuppoſed what he told me at preſent was the effect of a frenſie. He took a great deal of pains to perſwade me the contrary, but I ſtill
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:57207:303"/>
perſiſting, he conjured me at leaſt that his Tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and other Moveables might be reſtored. I let him underſtand that my credit could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo tar, becauſe the Moveables and Tapiſtries coming to be owned by the Proprietors, none would for my ſake be ſo unjuſt as to detain them from them. He went away murmuring in great diſcontent, and all things ſeeming to contribute to our mirth (though there was little appearance of any cauſe for it on my ſide) we were ſurpriſed to ſee coming out of a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing room the Sieur <hi>de Miniere</hi> ſtark naked, his hair tied up on the crown of his head like a bunch of Herons feathers, with a red ribband, his Boots on his ſhoulder like a Knapſack, falling on his knees before me, his fear (which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned) having turned his brain: I asked what he ſought of me in ſuch an equipage? He anſwered that deſiring to be my Chief Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, he came to take his Oath in ſuch manner as the Romans did to their antient Emperors. This though pleaſant, moved compaſſion, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the effects of fear of death in weak heads. I deſired care might be taken of him, and that he might have a Bed. <hi>Fabrani</hi> whoſe drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was not overcome by the diſpleaſure of his loſs, leaning againſt a Table, fell on the floor, ſo heavily, he might have broken the boards, which was another cauſe of laughter. Don <hi>Lewis Poderico</hi> told me, that it being late, he feared the like might happen to him or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Company, that it was therefore bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bid me good night, than give a new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

for laughter; and going away, our priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners alſo went every one to his lodging, none of my ſervants ſtaying, but ſuch as were to lie in my with-drawing room.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I was in Bed, the Spaniſh Captain that guarded me, deſired to ſee me and bid me good night, that he might be ſure he left me in my Chamber, after which he locked the door. I had toiled very much all day, and not ſlept the night before, which now recompenſing I awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not till Nine next morning As ſoon as I was deſirous to riſe, the Captain opened the door, to bid me good morrow, and ſee me in my Bed, afterwards going out to leave me to my liberty. Don <hi>Lewis Poderico</hi> ſent to enquire of my health, and whether it would not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to viſit me as ſoon as I ſhould be ready, ſending me linnen and a Coat, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I had nothing on but Buffe in which I had been taken, and the weather being yet cold. A little after he came into my Chamber, with the Prince of St. <hi>Severe</hi> his Nephew, the Prince <hi>de Forina,</hi> the Marquiſs <hi>de la Bella,</hi> the Prince <hi>de Supina</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Prince <hi>de Chiuſana,</hi> Don <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Caraffa,</hi> Don <hi>Joſeph Caetano,</hi> Don <hi>Caeſar de Capua,</hi> and many other Gentlemen. He asked if I would go to Maſs, whither they would all accompany me, cauſing the Spaniſh Guard to ſtay behind as unneceſſary, whileſt ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality went with me. All the French Priſoners came to me, and we went to a Church hard by, where I received all Honor and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities I could have expected if at liberty, and
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:57207:305"/>
all about me ſeemed rather perſons that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to make their Court to me, then ſuch as had a care to guard and ſecure me.</p>
            <p>After Maſs and a Walk I was brought home, and Monſieur <hi>Poderico</hi> having drawn me aſide, told me, that care ought to be taken of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my life, the worſt being to be diſtruſted from the cruel and jealous humor of the pani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; that the Nobility were too much obliged, and had too great eſteem and affection for me, to ſuffer me to run any hazard; that they would aſſuredly all rather periſh, than let me continue in danger: but that I muſt be helpful to my ſelf, and ſeek to get time, the beſt remedy on ſuch occaſions; that I was therefore to expreſs great diſſatisfaction againſt <hi>France</hi> for having aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned me, with equal intention to revenge my ſelf: that I muſt make a ſhew of engaging with <hi>Spain,</hi> and above all ſeek to perſwade them of my Title to the Dutchy of <hi>Modena,</hi> and that I doubted not to be able to recover it, if I might be ſeconded by their forces, and inveſted by the Emperor: that their hatred for that Duke (greater than for me) joyned to their deſire of being revenged on him, would oblige them to hearken to my Propoſals, which I was to be ſure to make conſiderable enough, to da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the eyes of Don <hi>John,</hi> a young and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince, and of the Viceroy, naturally a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Negotiations, ſo to oblige them to ſend sn account of my Offers to <hi>Madrid,</hi> which would gain much time, the firſt fury of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments being alone to be apprehended, as
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:57207:306"/>
in the Caſe of Mareſchal <hi>de Strozzi</hi> in the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His advice ſeemed good, and I deſired him to write to <hi>Naples</hi> that ſome body might be ſent to hear me, becauſe I had matters of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary importance to deliver. He diſpatched a Meſſenger immediately, and we had news next morning that the Biſhop of <hi>Averſa,</hi> a perſon of wit and capacity, Brother of the Prior of <hi>La Rocella,</hi> and of the Houſe of <hi>Caraffa,</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to confer with me. I dined alone that day, he excuſing himſelf by reaſon of the many affairs that preſſed him, and the Orders he was to give after ſo great a change of fortune. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving repoſed a while after dinner, ſome of the Nobility came to entertain me, and falling into diſcourſe of what had paſſed, and of their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and mine, we engaged ſo far, that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon a very conſiderable Negotiation, from which I might aſſuredly have drawn great advantages; when a Spaniard came in, whom I ſaw not, my back being to the door; but one of thoſe Gentlemen preſſing my foot, I inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed diſcourſe; which yet I could not do ſo handſomly, as altogether to prevent ſuſpicion: going out he immediately writ to the Earl of <hi>Ognate,</hi> that after I had ſo long maintained the People in rebellion, I ſought to debauche the Nobility, in which (if ſome ſpeedy prevention were not uſed) it was to be feared I might have ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>In the evening the Prince of <hi>Avellina</hi> came to ſee me, and return me thanks for the care I
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:57207:306"/>
had taken in preſerving the plunder of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and for puniſhing <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> who born his ſubject, had committed all imaginable inſolencies againſt him. I told him I was ſorry I could not render him ſervices more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that in my preſent condition, all I could do for his intereſts, was to adviſe him to make haſte to <hi>Naples,</hi> to ſave his Moveables, which I had carefully gathered together; but being laid up in my Pallace, the Spaniards would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly plunder it: on which account I very much lamented, that my intentions for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what belonged to him, gave occaſion for its being more expoſed to hazard. He thanked me, and taking my counſel, went away immediately to give order in his concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>After this the Prince of <hi>la Rocca Romana</hi> came to ſee me, whoſe company was very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable; for he was a great talker, and all his diſcourſe conſiſted of proteſtations of fidelity for <hi>Spain,</hi> with recital of his ſervices to that Crown, and his joy to ſee heaven declared in favour of it. After a very ſlender complement relating to my misfortune, he took his leave.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards in the mean time aſſembled, to deliberate what reſolution was to be taken in my behalf. Opinions differed. All the Members Of the Collateral Council voted my death, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this reaſon, that I had acquired ſo great credit, and ſo general an eſteem as well amongſt the Nobility as People, that it was to be feared that as long as I lived, the Kingdom could never
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:57207:307"/>
be well ſettled, and that the recovery of my liberty would again embroil all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that malecontents would alwayes keep alive in their hearts a ſecret hope, which fomenting the ſeeds of rebellion that remained, would produce effects on the firſt occaſion; that underſtanding the natural clemency of their King, they could do him no better ſervice, than to deprive him of the means of making uſe of it towards a Perſon ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and where its conſequences might be ſo fatal; that by this they ſhould free him from the importunities of all the Princes and Potentates of <hi>Europe,</hi> to whom I appertained by Blood, Alliance, or Friendſhip, who would certainly intercede for my life and liberty; that I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended ſo near a Throne, that my ambition could not be ſatisfied with any eſtabliſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; and that <hi>Naples</hi> had come too near my heart, to be ever forgotten by me: that as long as I lived, I would aſpire to the poſſeſſion of a Crown I thought I had loſt only by the effects of hazard and misfortune, and that I had look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as mine own: that the proceeding of the Marquiſs of St. <hi>Cruce</hi> in the Caſe of the Mareſhal of <hi>Strozzi</hi> in the <hi>Terceras</hi> was to be followed; that this execution was not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, leaſt <hi>France</hi> ſhould render it impoſſible, by avowing my actions and laying claim to me, as a perſon ſent by her; and that had acted only by her Power and Order: that they ought to mike no difficulty of following the example <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Anjou</hi> made of <hi>Conradin,</hi> and that by the counſel of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Fourth:
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:57207:307"/>
that if ſuch a proceeding ſeemed cruel, yet it would be very ſafe; and that when the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a Kingdom comes into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the moſt violent reſolutions are beſt: that beſides all this, my death would ſerve as a great example, to deterre and prevent ambitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from concerning themſelves in the inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Provinces, to which the Spaniſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy might be more liable than any other, having ſo many different Nations under its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and its Dominions ſo extended, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and at ſo great a diſtance from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Zeal for their Countrey inclined them not ſo much to this, as their ſhame of having had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to me for preſervation of their Eſtates and Charges, and their having held Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies with me, they thought could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be kept ſecret, unleſs by my death, and the removal of an irreproachable witneſs of their infidelity and treaſon.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide the Duke of <hi>Turſi</hi> that owed me his life, thought himſelf bound in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to requite me, by ſaving mine, and to that purpoſe alledged all the reaſons that Policy or Morality could ſuggeſt. They were ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Don <hi>Melchior de Borgia,</hi> who being my Kinſman (he by the Duke of <hi>Candie</hi> deſcending from Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by <hi>Lucretia de Borgia</hi> his Daughter, married into the Houſe of <hi>Ferrara</hi>) thought himſelf on that account en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in honour to preſerve me: he therefore omitted nothing to that purpoſe, embracing my
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:57207:308"/>
intereſts with all imaginable zeal, in it comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his natural inclination, which is ſweet and obliging. Theſe were perſons of another manner of conſideration and credit than thoſe of the Collateral Council, both of them of the Council of State of <hi>Spain,</hi> and deputed by the Catholick King as Councellors to aſſiſt Don <hi>John,</hi> by whoſe advice he was to regulate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to do nothing without their. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation; they added that if they were to be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by examples, the moſt honourable, and ſuch as had the beſt and moſt general reception in the world were to be followed: that the Marquiſs of St. <hi>Cruce</hi> was much blamed, and that his violence and precipitation might have coſt <hi>Spain</hi> very dear, had not troubles aroſe in <hi>France,</hi> which ſecured it from her reſentments: that the cruelty of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Anjou</hi> had been very much condemned, and blaſted the high reputation his Valour had acquired him, of which he repented at leiſure, by the bloody war that action drew upon him, which he was ready to ſink under; that in the end he loſt all <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and the head of his own Son (without a miraculous eſcape) had payed for that of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin</hi>: that the authority of Pope <hi>Clement</hi>'s counſel cannot juſtifie it, he having been a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared enemy to <hi>Conradin,</hi> whoſe reſentments and power he apprehended, and whom over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living but a very few dayes, his death ſeemed an extraordinary puniſhment of heaven for ſo violent a counſel; that the Hiſtory of <hi>England</hi> offered another manner of example of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:57207:308"/>
the Third, who by his Clemency acquired a reputation that will laſt as long as the world: The Lord <hi>Percy</hi> being in rebellion againſt him, <hi>Archibald Dowglas</hi> on his own account, and without the authority of the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> his Soveraign, entred <hi>England</hi> in Arms in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his revolted friend, beat up King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> his Quarters in a morning, and forced him to ſhift for himſelf bare-foot; but the King in that great battel he won againſt him, by which he re-eſtabliſhed his Crown, having ſtruck him from his Horſe with his Lance, and taken him priſoner, after a ſevere puniſhment of his rebellious ſubjects, his Council being of opinion that he ſhould cauſe <hi>Dowglas</hi> to die, as a particular perſon that unowned by any Crown, had come to foment rebellion in his Kingdom; that great and wiſe <hi>Edward</hi> anſwered, that not being born his ſubject he had no lawful autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over him, that his death would be a poor revenge, and blemiſh the glory of his victory, and that judging by the hurt he had done him, how much he might be capable to ſerve him, if he became his friend, he reſolved to give him liberty, which he did, deſiring his friendſhip, and tenderly embracing him, with high commendation of his vertue and courage; an action certainly well-becoming a moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prince, and that raiſed him in honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all his Contemporaries: they adviſed them therefore without paſſion to conſider which of theſe two examples was to be imitated by ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent a King as their Maſter, who feared nothing

from any private perſon, whom his generoſity might for ever engage to him, beſides the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the admiration of all <hi>Europe.</hi>

            <p>The Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> ſubtil and politick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the firſt Opinion, which he fortified by many reaſons; but would not take the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of it on himſelf alone: beſides being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in love with Negotiations, he thought nothing could be loſt by hearing what I had to ſay, which could not cauſe any long delay, and after examination whether my Offers were of greater or leſs importance to their Monarchy than my death, either would be in his choice, as abſolutely depending on him; and he ſo highly ſatisfied himſelf that hazard recovered <hi>Naples,</hi> that he would not lightly hazard his reputation, nor do any thing that might appear blameable; it being an ordinary Maxime amongſt the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, <hi>That time and patience never prejudice af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which precipitation often ruins.</hi>

            <p>Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> a young Prince, brave and generous, ſuffering himſelf to be led by his own inclinations, joyned with thoſe that had honour on their ſide, making a long and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcourſe, ſuch as could not have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from his youth, but rather from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon grown old in affairs, that having fixed all his thoughts on glory, governs the advantages of his Nation by high and ſplendid proceedings. He ſaid, That the actions he had ſeen me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, having gained me his eſteem, he could not hinder his affection from joyning with it; that he could not (without too ſenſible an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)

ſee a Prince (whom it was in his power to ſave) die miſerably: that he ſhould think this not only infamous to himſelf, but contrary to the honour of the King his Father, who might draw greater advantages from my life than puniſhment: that ſuch a Clemency would draw on his head a thouſand Benedictions, and the applauſe of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and that he could never find a ſubject that merited it more than I, and that in my perſon alone he might oblige all the Princes to whom I was related: that it would be injurious to the Spaniſh Monarchy to diſcover to the eyes of all the world, that ſhe ſacrificed my life to her ſecurity; that ſhe was too well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed to be any ways ſhaken by any private perſon; that we lived not in the Age of Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when a Knight Errant by his perſonal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was able to deſtroy Kingdoms: that I were indeed an enemy to be apprehended, if I had the diſpoſal of the power of <hi>France,</hi> but that ſhe had ſufficiently diſcovered that ſhe would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contribute to the exaltation or eſtabliſhment of my fortune: that ſhe abandonned me at a time when without danger ſhe might have deprived them of a Crown; and that it was very apparent ſhe choſe rather not to weaken her enemies than to ſuffer me to profit by their ſpoils; that he ſaw great advantages in this ſo extraordinary Maxime, becauſe <hi>France</hi> alone being unable to make conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable and remote Conqueſts, and that People ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improper to conſerve them, <hi>Spain</hi> needed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear the ſeditions nor revolts of any of her Dominions, time being alwayes favourable to

her; beſides that her ſubjects would never be forward, to flie to a protection, that in this conjuncture ſhewed it ſelf, ſo uſeleſs; and that no Princes would thence-forward engage in the concernments of a Nation that would not ſuffer them to help themſelves, and that looked with envy on the advantages acquired by ſerving her, though at the coſt of the enemy: that judging my thoughts by his own, he believed me incenſed by the refuſal of aſſiſtance in ſo glorious an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and ſo far provoked, that I breathed nothing but revenge, nor deſired to preſerve my life, but in order to it: that his Opinion was that this was to be fomented, and endeavours uſed to gain a perſon that might be ſo conſiderable to them: that the greater my ambition ſeemed, the greater confidence they ought to have in me, for perceiving <hi>France</hi> would never give me wherewithal to ſatisfie it, I would inſeparably engage my ſelf to <hi>Spain,</hi> who at its own charge would aſſiſt me with all things neceſſary to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it: that they ought not to ruin me on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my having concerned my ſelf in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of <hi>Naples,</hi> beauſe it is honourable for a couragious Prince to ſeek his advancement, which he cannot do with greater reaſon and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice than amongſt the enemies of his Countrey: that he could not blame that in me which he would have practiced himſelf, if he had been in my place, and that it cannot be imputed a Crime, to ſeek to acquire a Crown, from a Monarchy oppoſite to that to which we are born ſubjects: that he diſcerned nor the reaſon why particular
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:57207:310"/>
actions when glorious, ſhould paſs for more cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal than general ones, being as uſeful and ſometimes more to the advantage of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: and that thoſe he had ſeen me do, being ſo eminent, obliged him to wiſh me well, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt to love vertue even in the perſons of thoſe that fight againſt us, and which for that cauſe we hate: that he thought himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to exempt me from this number, and having made appear by his diſcourſe how eaſily and ſafely I might be gained, he ſhould preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the ſervice of the King his Father, if he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not his uttermoſt endeavours towards it: that by what I had done without ſupplies and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, might eaſily be gathered what I could do in my Countrey amongſt my Relations, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Power, and animated by a ſpirit of revenge, in a Kingdom ſo turbulent and ever ready for revolutions: that his opinion was not only for ſaving my life, but giving me liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: that having honour, I would queſtionleſs become faithful to <hi>Spain</hi> the remainder of my dayes, receiving ſo conſiderable and undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved favours from her, <hi>France</hi> inſtead of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing my ſervices having ingratefully aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned me: that their hatred and animoſities for the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> were much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than for me, who after the ſo good u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the King his Father, without any cauſe of complaint, or dependance on or engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any other, had proclaimed war againſt them voluntarily, and attacqued the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> for enlarging his own Territories; but
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:57207:311"/>
that things were very different on my ſide; that I was born a Frenchman; that war had been proclaimed between the two Crowns, and was not brought by me to <hi>Naples,</hi> that came thither only to ſeek my fortune, by aſſiſting ſuch as had already taken arms againſt the profeſt enemies of my Countrey: that it was good policy to revenge our ſelves of one enemy by the hand of another, and that I might moſt fitly be made uſe of againſt the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi>; that the Emperour had cauſe enough to diſpoſſeſs him by the Imperial Ban; and my inveſture in that Dominion being procured, to give me forces ſufficient to puniſh him, which he himſelf could not do without provoking the oppoſition and jealouſie of all <hi>Italy</hi>; that this policy would ſeem new to all the Council, but we muſt change according to Occurrences, and when it ſhould be examined without prejudice, he thought it would find a general approbation, without the contradiction of the King his Father. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſuſpended the opinions of all the Council, it was not followed becauſe too favourable to me, neither durſt any perſiſt in that which was contrary, two Councellors of State having vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the preſervation of my life: The reſult therefore was to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for the advice of the Cardinals of the Spaniſh Faction, and to determine nothing concerning me till the receipt of their Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marco de Lorenzo</hi> in the mean time to teſtifie his zeal for me, reſolved to hazard a meſſage to get news of me, and ſend me an account of
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:57207:311"/>
what paſſed in <hi>Naples,</hi> he entruſted this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to a Muſician he had, who had the cunning (for all my Guards) to get to me in my Chamber, where he told me, that the Town made no oppoſition to the entry of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> nor durſt take arms, becauſe of the report induſtriouſly ſpread abroad that I had made an agreement with them; of which when they came to be diſabuſed by the news of my impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, the publick ſorrow and deſpair was unimaginable: that though the inhabitants were not yet diſarmed, the intention was to do it: that they were flattered by many fair promiſes, with hope of the confirmation of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and exemption from Taxes: but that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing all thoſe advantages, they had unanimou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly anſwered, That having ſo eſſential Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to me, they could not look on my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nor the great peril to which my life was expoſed, without a moſt ſenſible concernment, and that therefore renouncing all other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the people were ready without conteſt to ſubmit to whatſoever the Viceroy ſhould pleaſe to impoſe upon them, provided I might be ſet at liberty, and that they would freely ſacrifice their lives and eſtates, with their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to my intereſts. The concernment of the City of <hi>Naples</hi> for my impriſonment, and my fidelity to them, were great conſolations to me: And though I apprehended my life to be in a great deal of danger, this relation was very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, and I deſired the Meſſenger to aſſure his Maſter of my acknowledgments, and to tell
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:57207:312"/>
all his acquaintance that my misfortune afflicted me on no other account but in that it prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from delivering them from oppreſſion, according to my promiſe and moſt earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon the Biſhop of <hi>Averſa</hi> was brought to me by Don <hi>Lewis Poderico,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the complement, to which my condition obliged a perſon of his generoſity, we took Chairs, and having cauſed all to avoid the room, he told me, That in order to my demand that ſome body might be deputed to hear the Propoſals I had to make, Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and the Viceroy had given him Commiſſion for it: that he had accepted it with joy, as an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of doing me effectual ſervice, that I might at leaſt aſſure my ſelf of this, that it could have been put into the hands of no perſon of better intentions, and that he would employ the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of his care and addreſs, to free me from my misfortune, or at leaſt to conſolate it.</p>
            <p>I told him that I came not to <hi>Naples</hi> without the participation of <hi>France,</hi> and the aſſurance that it was the beſt ſervice I could poſſibly render her: that a reſolution had been taken that I ſhould have embarked on the Fleet and commanded it, ſo to carry the people all the aſſiſtance they had deſired but that the extremity to which they were reduced not permitting them to tarry ſo long, the French Miniſters at <hi>Rome</hi> had preſſed me to hazard that paſſage, which ſucceeded not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great deal of toil and danger: that I
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:57207:312"/>
would without regret have ſacrificed my ſelf for the intereſts and glory of the Crown to which I was born a ſubject: that the King had not only approved my reſolution, but had by his Letters teſtified an extraordinary obligation to me, with aſſurance that he would aſſiſt me with all things neceſſary, and ſend me a potent Fleet, with men, ammunition, money, and victuals: after all which the envy and malice of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or rather the treachery of a Penſioner of <hi>Spain,</hi> had cauſed me to have been miſerably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned; but thinking my life could not be ſpent better than for the advantages of my Countrey, neither my courage nor good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions became leſs on that account; and he might probably have heard what offers I had refuſed, it being impoſſible for me to be biaſed from my duty: that all my endeavors were recompenced with a Priſon: that by ſo unjuſt and hard uſage I was diſcharged both in the ſight of God and men of all Obligation and Allegiance: that my reſentments were as great as juſt: that I would therefore caſt my ſelf abſolutely under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and into the intereſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> who, by what I had done againſt her, might eaſily judge what I could undertake againſt <hi>France,</hi> (even at the point of an inſurrection) when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by her power: that I had friends and relations very much diſſatisfied, who would concern themſelves in the wrongs I had received, my fidelity having been diſtruſted, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the Crown neglected, only in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to deſtroy me: that in ſome Provinces I had
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:57207:313"/>
powerful Confederates: that I had ſome Towns in my own poſſeſſion, and could engage others very conſiderable, it being now become a cuſtom rather to ſerve our friend than our King; that I offered in order to my revenge, to make uſe of whatſoever was in my power: that none could be more fit to puniſh the Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena,</hi> againſt whom they were more juſtly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated than againſt me: and to make appear that I would be very ſerious in this Engagement, (if they thought fit to make uſe of and put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in me) I would begin by the pacification of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> the infallible wayes to effect which I underſtood: that my Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals carried their ſecurity along with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being a priſoner my life was to be reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them: then deſcending to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of what I have reported, they appeared ſo advantageous to <hi>Spain,</hi> that he aſſured me they would be received with open arms, and that he thought I ſhould obtain all manner of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and my liberty, which he would go and endeavour with a moſt zealous application and affection: that he hoped to bring me anſwer in three dayes if I ſtayed ſo long at <hi>Capua,</hi> or elſe with Don <hi>Lewis Poderico</hi> come to me to <hi>Gaeta,</hi> if the reſolution of conducting me thither ſhould have effect.</p>
            <p>My life being concerned, I omitted nothing that I thought might flatter the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and made the ruin of <hi>France</hi> appear ſo eaſie, that (they being ſoon perſwaded of what they deſire, to which their natural vanity, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:57207:313"/>
of other Nations and all power but their own, inclines them) I perceived my Propoſals would be ſent to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where matters never being readily determined on, during an infinite number of <hi>Junto</hi>'s and a great deal of time, I might ſet ſo many hands on work towards my preſervation, that my life would be ſecure, fearing only the firſt heat, which cooling, I could have no apprehenſion of their cutting off my head at the end of three moneths. Having thus gotten time I entertained hope.</p>
            <p>The Expreſs ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> being arrived there, the Cardinals of the Faction of <hi>Spain</hi> and its Miniſters aſſembled often to deliberate on an affair of ſo great importance: the Pope ſo tenderly affected me, that he wept at the report of my misfortune, and knowing that my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt danger lay in being diſowned by <hi>France,</hi> (Monſieur <hi>de Fontenay</hi> giving out that my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings had been with his participation, but not by his Order, ſuppoſing this would haſten my ruin, of which he was deſirous, to quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of an enemy his Conduct had diſ-obliged, and that could never pardon him; as indeed my reſentments could not have been overcom but by the mediation of perſons of very great power, whom I valued ſo much I could deny them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, with the conſideration of an alliance he made into a Family I particularly love and eſteem; with which yet I complied not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very great difficulty and conteſtation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my ſelf.) ſent for Cardinal <hi>Albornos,</hi> and told him he wondered to hear that <hi>France</hi> had
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:57207:314"/>
not only abandoned me, but that her Miniſters diſowned all that I had done for her ſervice and by her order, though her Ambaſſadour the day after my embarking, came in the name of the King to acquaint him with it, and to aſſure him that I ſhould be powerfully aſſiſted, and that a Fleet was making ready in <hi>Province,</hi> to be ſent with all manner of aſſiſtance to me; which he offered to juſtifie to him, ſuppoſing he durſt not deny what he had acquainted him with, at an extraordinary Audience which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly deſired to that purpoſe: He ordered him to write this into <hi>Spain,</hi> and to let them know that he concerned himſelf in the preſervation of my life, as much as if I were his Nephew: and not ſatisfied to have told the ſame to all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals and Miniſters of that Faction, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to write to <hi>Naples</hi> that nothing ſhould be attempted againſt my perſon without the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Catholick King; himſelf diſpatched an Expreſs to him in the moſt obliging and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing terms imaginable, begging my life, as the greateſt and moſt ſenſible favour he could poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> (alwayes in a perfect tranquility) is a place where affairs are more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively conſidered than in any other part of the world, and where greater reſpect is had to the conſequences of them; theſe Cardinals ſollicited by all their Companiors, who had a great deal of kindneſs for me, became very moderate, and writ to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> in ſuch a manner as I my ſelf could wiſh. This gave <hi>France</hi> time not
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:57207:314"/>
only to own what I had done, but to threaten the like to all the priſoners in her hands, or that ſhe ſhould take afterwards, if my life were attempted. All the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> to whom I have the honour to be related, concerned themſelves for me. And the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> hearing of my misfortune, told the Archduke and the Earl of <hi>Fuenſaldagne</hi> very ſmartly that he would never ſerve thoſe that ſhould dip their hands in the blood of his Family: that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he had done the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted conſideration might be had of his mediation, and my life be granted him, which he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as the greateſt recompence he could pretend to: he repreſented the ſame at <hi>Madrid</hi> by the Captain of his Guard, whom he ſent expreſly thither.</p>
            <p>Theſe powerful Mediations, with the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals I made to ſerve <hi>Spain,</hi> obtained ſuch effect as I could wiſh, judging, that ſince Kings ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to Clemency, he of <hi>Spain</hi> would never command my execution, when it was become apparent to all the world that it depended only on his will, and could not be done but by his particular Order. Orders for my removal to <hi>Gaeta</hi> were brought to <hi>Capua,</hi> but deferred till they ſhould have choſen a perſon to take charge of me, and had provided a Galley to tranſport me.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Lewis Poderico</hi> brought me to the <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries,</hi> where all the Ladies and people of the Town crowded to ſee me, with extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of kindneſs and ſorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="550" facs="tcp:57207:315"/>On Eaſter-Day I heard Maſs and did my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions in the great Church, where ſomething very pleaſant happened to me. I made my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the Sieur <hi>de Marests</hi> my Almoner, and accuſing my ſelf to have put many perſons to death, to which perhaps I had been more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by conſideration of my own ſafety, than zeal for juſtice; he anſwered in choler, I was at <hi>Naples</hi> with you, and know you cauſed not enough to die, and can bear witneſs that had you not ſpared ſo many, we might have been there ſtill, and not priſoners here. I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that this anſwer, which I expected not from a Confeſſor, made me ſmile: as ſoon as I came home I told it to the company, who after having a while laughed at it, declared their opinions that he had told me the truth.</p>
            <p>My familiarity with the Nobility, and their friendſhip for me, which was daily augmented by converſation, made the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſome bad effects of it, not looking upon them as very well affected to him, and therefore he reſolved to ſuffer it no longer. He ſent an Order that none ſhould particularly, nor with ſo much liberty viſit me. He entruſted the Prince of <hi>La Rocca Romana,</hi> in whom he had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary confidence, to command a little body, without any dependence on Don <hi>Lewis Poderico,</hi> which ſo much offended him, that he quitted the imployment he had till then mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and on Monday morning came to tell me, that he was very ſorry he was no longer in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſerve me, his authority being at an
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:57207:315"/>
end; that he was to put me into the hands of Don <hi>Caeſar</hi> of <hi>Capua,</hi> Governor of the Town, of whom yet he could give me aſſurance, being a very worthy perſon and his particular friend, and one from whom I ſhould receive all manner of civilities, and then went away for <hi>Naples,</hi> to complain of his uſage, which ſeemed very much to diſcontent him. Three dayes after, they carried me and all the reſt of the priſoners to Caſtle <hi>Voltorno</hi> (where I was to meet a Galley to tranſport me) in Coaches, the greateſt part of them drawn by Oxen, in regard of the bad way: I was guarded by a Troop of Horſe that, as ſoon as they had delivered me at Caſtle <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torno,</hi> were to return all night.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Lewis Poderico</hi> having diſpatched his buſineſs at <hi>Naples,</hi> and received Order to draw out all the Troops he had left in <hi>Capua,</hi> and march inſtantly into <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> to drive from thence <hi>Tobias Palavicini</hi> and the Marquiſs <hi>de Palombara,</hi> who commanded in that province, and reduce it to obedience; a Burgundian, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to the Camp-Maſter-General, took charge of me. At my arrival I found that the Galley that ſhould take me in, was not come, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of bad weather, which hindered it two dayes longer; during which time I had no other Guard but a Foot Company, the greateſt part of the Soldiers being Burgundians, Lorrainers, and Frenchmen; and what I thought ſomething extraordinary, a Soldier ſtanding Centry at my Chamber Door, ſpeaking French to me, told me he was of <hi>Joinville,</hi> offering all he poſſibly
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:57207:316"/>
could do for my eſcape, telling me that the greateſt part of the Company being Lorrainers, he was confident they would gladly do the like, and that all his Camerades having been taken priſoners and liſted at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt their wills, would be very glad to forſake the ſervice. I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him as ſoon as he ſhould be relieved to found the inclinations of his companions. Two hours after he came to tell me in their names, that I might aſſure my ſelf of them to what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſoever I pleaſed, and that if occaſion were I might make uſe of their arms: that which I thought moſt ſtrange was, that the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Camp-Maſter-General continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly railed at the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by whom he ſaid he had been ill uſed: that he came ſo ſhort of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for thirty years ſervice, that he had hardly bread to eat, and that he ſought only a good occaſion to retire. He endeavoured very ſollicitouſly to inform himſelf whether I had any money at <hi>Rome,</hi> hoping to make his fortune by me; this was reported to me by all he talked with, and afterwards confirmed by his helping <hi>Compagnon</hi> my Steward to make his eſcape, for fourteen or fifteen Piſtols worth of trifles he had about him. He permitted me to walk by the Sea-ſide as far as a little Chappel of our Lady of great Devotion, about a quarter of a league from Caſtle <hi>Voltorno,</hi> followed only by four Musketeers, though we were two and thirty pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, all French, except the Sieur <hi>Marcili,</hi> who was an Italian. This number was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented from <hi>Capua</hi> during our ſtay here, the
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:57207:316"/>
Baron of <hi>Rouvron, de Fargis</hi> Governour of <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azzo, Beauvais</hi> Colonel in <hi>Averſa,</hi> St. <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> Captain of Foot, and others having been brought in after Sieur <hi>Poderico</hi>'s Proclamation, of which I have already ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Some of our People walking on the Haven ſaw there ſix Felucca's provided with Sails, Oars, and Rudders, of which they preſently gave me notice. The Sieurs <hi>de Mallet</hi> and <hi>d'Eureux,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded my eſcape, which, after having brought a little victuals aboard, might be done in an hours time. The Sieur <hi>D'Eureux</hi> a good Seaman, that had a long time commanded as Lieutenant of one of the Gallies of <hi>France,</hi> aſſured me that putting off at the beginning of the night, which we might do without oppoſition or difficulty, he would land me the next morning in the Popes Dominion. The eaſineſs of this deſign diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging my attempting it, and recollecting the Spaniards ſubtilty in preventing the people of <hi>Naples</hi> from taking armes, and defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that night they made themſelves Maſters of the Town, I could not imagine it poſſible for them to be guilty of ſuch negligence as to leave things in a condition of giving me ſo much faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to get out of their hands; and that therefore many people would perſwade themſelves that this was a connivence, and done expreſly, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the order given to the Troop of horſe that conducted me to <hi>Caſtle Voltorno,</hi> to return as ſoon as they had ſeen me there, and the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in Garriſon there a foot Company of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers, Burgundians,</hi> and <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> whom I
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:57207:317"/>
might eaſily debauch, and make uſe of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the delay of the Gally that was to carry me to <hi>Gaeta,</hi> and of thoſe Felucca's. I thought theſe things would ſeem ſo probable that I ſhould find it difficult to juſtifie my ſelf, and that they which had prevented my being aſſiſted would endeavor (in excuſe of their evil conduct by which I had been abandoned) to perſwade all the world of them. That it would be impoſſible for me to put this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion out of the heads of the people of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the greateſt part of <hi>Italy.</hi> I reſolved therefore what danger ſoever I might undergo, rather to continue Priſoner, than to get my liberty ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, and by a way that might give ſome jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie that I had not acted with fidelity and honor. I think very few perſons in the world have done as I did. but I am ſo ſcrupulous on ſuch occaſions, that I cannot ſuffer the leaſt ſhadow of diſtruſt. I conjured all my Camrades to make their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, it being unreaſonable they ſhould ſuffer for my obſtinacy and nice humor. Their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity ſuffered them not to abandon me, but they uſed their utmoſt endeavors (though in vain) to convince me, by repreſenting that time and my actions would ſufficiently juſtifie me, and that I had acquired too high an eſteem to be loſt ſo eaſily, neither could any part of it be hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by making uſe of a favorable occaſion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me by heaven and my good fortune, which once loſt was irrecoverable. I continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by all theſe reaſons, and notwithſtanding the tediouſneſs of my ſufferings, when I make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon it, I cannot repent my doing as I

did, to have preferred my honor before my life and liberty.</p>
            <p>Next morning the Spaniſh Galley appeared, but the ſhallowneſs of the water not ſuffering her to come near the land, ſhe kept her ſelf about two hundred yards at Sea, and <hi>Dom Alvaro de la Torre</hi> Lieutenant of the Camp-maſter-General, with ſome Reformadoes came aſhore in the boat to receive me. All my company and Servants were moſt ſenſibly afflicted: They had been told that I ſhould have been allowed the choice of eight or nine perſons to have taken with me, to have kept me company at <hi>Gaeta,</hi> and a great emulation aroſe who ſhould make up that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but <hi>Alvaro de la Torre</hi> ſoon put an end to it; for after a very ſlender Complement in the name of the Viceroy, he told me he had order to take but two perſons along with me, namely a Chamberlain and a Cook; but having no Cook, and the permiſſion being for two, I deſired it might be a Gentleman and a Chamberlain. He rudely anſwered it could be no more than one of them, and the Knight <hi>des Eſſars</hi> being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come into the Boat, unwilling to oblige him to go out I took my place, and they rowed off, all whom I left on the ſhoar deſpairing of ever ſeeing me again, by their cries and tears expreſſed ſo much ſorrow, that I was more ſenſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at it than at the unfortunate condition to which I found my ſelf reduced, A Capuchin was ſeated next me, which I looked on as a bad omen: and I over-heard a Spaniſh reformed Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain called <hi>Ambroſio Fermandez</hi> ſay it was ſtrange
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:57207:318"/>
they ſuffered me to live ſo long, which I could never forgive him to this day. I continued a while ſilent, making reflexions on my preſent misfortune. <hi>Don Alvaro de la Torre,</hi> naturally very uncivil and very indiſcreet, applyed himſelf then and ever after to give me all diſcontent ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, of which taking little notice I began to rally, in which he interrupted me to tell me, that the Councel had aſſembled twice to deliberate of my life, and had not <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> oppoſed it, (my death being neceſſary towards the ſettling the affairs of <hi>Spain,</hi> and reeſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its authority in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>) I had already mounted a Scaffold to puniſh my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence for pretending to a Throne: that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of this was deferred till the return of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> for the opinions of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Cardinals of that Faction; that I was therefore to prepare my ſelf for all events. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him laughing, that it was happy for me that his opinion had not been demanded, ſince I perceived it would not have been favorable; but that my head was too well ſettled on my ſhoulders, to be ſhaken by the humor of private perſons, and that the blood of thoſe of my qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity uſed not to be ſhed without the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preciſe order of Kings.</p>
            <p>This entertainment, not very agreeable, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not till we came to the Gally, which did not ſalute me, and into which they cauſed me to aſcend not only without ceremony, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civility, the Spiniards uſing very little with Priſoners of what quality ſoever. As ſoon
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:57207:318"/>
as I came into the Cabbin, they ſeated me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Capuchins, who buſied themſelves to entertain me with ſuch diſcourſe as is uſually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to perſons that are to prepare for death: yet all thoſe Ceremonies gave me no alarm, they ſeemed too affected to be much apprehended, and I only told them with a ſmile, that at that time all things were ſo indifferent to me, that I was incapable of fear: That in ſpight of my Enemies nothing ſhould make me ſad, and that my life being in the hands of God, I would make no inquiry into the duration of it: but of this I was reſolved, that whilſt I could preſerve it I would make it as agreeable and pleaſant to me as poſſibly I could.</p>
            <p>The Knight <hi>des Eſſars</hi> ſomething more appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive than my ſelf, was not at his eaſe, the Companion of the Capuchin that entertained me telling him, that my life was at an end, and that he being a Switzer, and on return to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, would willingly take upon him to go into <hi>France</hi> to carry my laſt Teſtament to my relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He could not hear this without extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary concernment, and came to tell me of it with a great alarum; I anſwered; (burſting out into laughter) that he was very ſilly to contribute to the diverſion of thoſe people, that ſtudied all our poſtures, to deride afterwards the weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we ſhould diſcover, and turning to <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco de la Cotera,</hi> Captain of the Gally, told him, Sir, our diſcourſe is very ſerios for perſons that have not dined, I fared very ill at <hi>Caſtle Voltor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and am very hungry, and you will do me a
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:57207:319"/>
kindneſs to let me have ſomething to eat. Such perſons as I, accuſtomed to travel the world are not baſhfull, but freely demand what they have occaſion for: he gave order, and quickly after Dinner was brought in. Being a perſon of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor he told me he had ſuch an eſteem for me, that he could not ſee my ruin without ſorrow, and that he was obliged to wiſh me well, by reaſon of the acquaintance I formerly had in <hi>Flanders</hi> with his Brother <hi>Don Pedro de la Cotera,</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of foot and Governor of <hi>Gueldres,</hi> and on that acount to acquaint me with the danger I was in, from which yet I might eaſily free my ſelf, by appearing very much animated againſt <hi>France,</hi> and reſolved to embrace the intereſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> which would make great advantages by acquiſition of ſuch a perſon, whoſe courage and addreſs might be very uſeful to her. I thanked him for his good advice, and told him, that what he had mentioned was not only my greateſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but that it had been already propounded to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> and the Viceroy. He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glad of it, and aſſured me, (that being ſo) not only of his confidence of my obtaining liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but eſtabliſhing a glorious fortune.</p>
            <p>After dinner going upon the Deck, I began to put in practiſe what he had ſo kindly adviſed me to; which I looked upon as the general ſenſe of their whole Nation, ſo many perſons having agreed in it. As ſoon therefore as I returned to the Company, I ſaid that notwithſtanding the great hatred I perceived they had for me, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was more obliged to me than to
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:57207:319"/>
any other perſon in the world, for having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſo floriſhing a City as <hi>Naples</hi> from ſack and fire, and preventing that whole Kingdomes being plundered of all its wealth, towards which I had laboured more ſucceſsfully than all his Miniſters, that I would yet do more by making it peaceable to him, which would be very eaſie for me, and impoſſible for any other. That it was but reaſonable that in order to ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a ſervice he ſhould grant me his protection, and revenge me of <hi>France</hi> for having abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and thwarted my fortune, which would have raiſed me to be the moſt glorious perſon of my age had I received the leaſt aſſiſtance: That I therefore deſired nothing ſo paſſionately as to kindle a fire there by an Inſurrection, which would not be difficult to me. This diſcourſe met a general applauſe, and the greateſt part of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards having very little knowledge of the affairs of the world, and being eaſily flattered by what appears advantageous to them, they ſeemed already perſwaded of the ruin of <hi>France,</hi> and looked upon it to be in my power. This was ſo agreeable to them that I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they began to uſe me with ſomething leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civility.</p>
            <p>By this time we arrived at <hi>Gaeta,</hi> where land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they put me into a Sedan and carried me to the Caſtle, with Guards round about me, who took an exact care to let none come near me, and prevent me from ſeeing, or being ſeen. As ſoon as I came thither they brought me to the Chappel, and from thence up a pair of ſtairs, as

I aſcended which, I would have turned into an appartment on my left hand, but I was told it was higher, but ſeeing no ſtairs I went out upon a Terraſs, which they cauſed me to paſs over, from whence by a little Gate I mounted a very dark pair of ſtairs, where I found another little Terraſs fourteen or fifteen foot broad and twice as long, where they placed nine or ten Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers; but I could ſee no Chamber, till in a corner they opened a great iron gate which I had not perceived, which with another that was within it, and a grate, gave me entrance into a Tower, whoſe walls might be twenty or two and twenty foot thick, and whoſe Windows could be approached no nearer. This was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable appartment they had provided for me: There was an ugly Bed without Curtains, and Sheets on it, in which a Coſin of <hi>Maſſaniello</hi>'s, whom they had hanged five or ſix dayes before, had lain two moneths. I deſired clean ones might be brought, which they refuſed, telling me I was but too well, and that a man that had ſo few dayes to live ought not to be ſo curious, I only laughed at this bad entertainment: the thing that alone ſeemed inſupportable to me, was that at the Beds-head ſtood a great pot full of filth, which had not been emptied in three Moneths: I deſired it might be carried away, the ſtink being ſo abominable that it overcame me: I was told, that they would ſee what might be done next morning, but for that night they would not meddle with it. The Capuchin I had ſeen in the Boat preſenting
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:57207:321"/>
himſelf at the gate of the Tower, the Knight <hi>des Eſſars</hi> took alarme, and asked what it meant, and was told it was to confeſs me, and ſeeing him accompanied by an Officer of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorca</hi> of very bad meen, he took him for the Hang-man, and in diſorder cried out to me we are now ruined; Let them alone (ſaid I) to act their farce, they ſhall not have the pleaſure of affrighting me. I was guarded by four Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Captains, and as many Alfieres and Serjeants relieved every day. One Captain and two Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieres (one of which was Don <hi>Alvaro</hi>'s man, whom he had appointed to ſerve me) with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, never ſuffered me to be out of their ſight, and lay in my Chamber. I told <hi>Franciſco de Herrera,</hi> who as the eldeſt took the firſt Guard, that perceiving I was to tarry long, I would not afflict my ſelf, nor give thoſe that loved me not occaſion to rejoyce at my melancholy, but would ſeek my diverſion by all wayes, and to that purpoſe deſired him to do me the favour to help me to ſome Books. He told me they had none in <hi>French,</hi> but anſwering him, that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Italian</hi> and underſtanding <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> I ſhould be ſatisfied with one in either of thoſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages: He ſent to ſeek, and the firſt that was preſented to me was in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and the Title, <hi>A Preparation to well dying:</hi> I returned it to him without looking any farther, as ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in no preſent need of it, nor being devour enough to pleaſe my ſelf in ſuch contemplations, and prayed him to help me to ſome Comedies or Hiſtories: They brought me that of <hi>Naples,</hi>
               <pb n="562" facs="tcp:57207:322"/>
and my natural curioſity obliging me to look on what is marked in a Book, I found where a leaf had been turned down at a great print of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading of <hi>Conradin,</hi> and laughing at all theſe affectations, told them they had done me the greateſt pleaſure imaginable, that I had heard his tragical adventure ſpoken of, but ignorant of its particularities, ſhould be very glad to learn them. I laid up the Book in a corner of the Tower, and asked for Supper, that I might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards lie down to reſt. A moſt wretched Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was brought me, that my entertainment might be ſuitable; it was a piece of meat drie and burnt, and I think had been purpoſely drawn through the aſhes, a ſtinking ſalad, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned as I thought with the Oil of the Lamp of the Chappel; the bread was very dry and muſty; for deſſert I had two wrinckled apples and nuts; the wine onely was paſſable: that which I eat did not over-charge my ſtomach. The naſtineſs of the Bed permitted not unclothing, I only cauſed my Boots to be pulled off, and after they had brought an ill-favoured Quilt for the Knight of <hi>Eſſars</hi> and the Captain that guarded us, they ſhut the two iron gates upon us, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great noiſe of locks and bolts. I believe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man would hardly have ſlept in ſo bad a Lodging, and near ſo ill ſcents, but my weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs preventing any great reflexion, I ſlept till day entring at the windows awaked me.</p>
            <p>Next morning about ten a clock, Don <hi>Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro de la Torre</hi> came to me, and asked if I would go to Maſs? which having accepted, he brought
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:57207:322"/>
me to the Chappel and afterwards returned me to my Lodging. As we paſſed over the Terraſs I deſired him that we might walk there till Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner time, which he refuſed, permitting me on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſtay and take a little air, on that that was before my Chamber-door. I continued there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an hour, encompaſſed by the Officers of the Guard and nine or ten Musketeers, after which Dinner was brought into my Chamber, where he ſtayed to bear me company, as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes afterwards did; he, the Knight <hi>des Eſſars,</hi> and the Captain that had the Guard, ſtill eating with me: our cheer was not altogether ſo bad as at Supper. Our diſcourſe was very pleaſant, by it Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> diſcovered his ignorance and little wit, with inſupportable vanity. He told me he was firſt of all a ſoldier at the skirmiſh of the hills of <hi>Orbitello,</hi> and that he had afterwards ſeen all that paſſed at <hi>Naples,</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the revolutions to my impriſonment; that he was not troubled that he had ſeen no more, becauſe he learned more by this than he could have done in thirty <hi>Campagna</hi>'s in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Milan,</hi> or <hi>Catalonia,</hi> there having hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened more extraordinary actions, and gallant encounters, than are to be found in all Hiſtory. I anſwered him, ſmiling, that I had not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo much, though probably I muſt needs have ſeen more than he, becauſe he was ſtill confined to the guard of ſome particular Poſt, and that all the concernments of the party I had taken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on me, it was neceſſary I ſhould be every where: that my opinion was, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:57207:323"/>
well learning the profeſſion of a ſoldier, moſt of the paſſages of ſo irregular a war were to be forgotten, where nothing new or rare had been practiſed, but to fight like Cats in gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Above all, he ſeemed very joyful to have learned how Mines are made, of which till then he had no notion: I replied, that I had made none for want of powder, neither had I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that any had been made on his ſide. He told me he had loſt a ſoldier whom he very much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, one of the greateſt Miners of <hi>Italy,</hi> who had done him the pleaſure to cauſe one to play before him. I could not imagin where this could have been, till he told me that towards <hi>Sancta Maria la Nova,</hi> nine or ten men of the party of the people, having lodged themſelves in an upper Chamber, under which he was, that ſoldier bringing a Barrel of Powder, and laying a train, fired it, and with the floor and roof carried them into the air: that this ſeemed very handſome and very ſtrange to him, and having been told that Mines were made in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by digging under ground, it ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, that he was night and day alarmed at the leaſt noiſe he heard, and was ſo vigilant, that he once took the nibbling of a Mouſe for the working a Mine: that his care and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience he had acquired in five or ſix moneths time had gained him the favour of the Viceroy, who entruſted to him the guard of the <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites Tower,</hi> where he paſſed two or three dayes very unquietly, for fear of being ſurprized; but after he had well fortified it, he ſlept in repoſe.
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:57207:323"/>
I asked what works he had cauſed to be made? becauſe underſtanding the ſtrong and weak parts of that Poſt, none could better judge of them? He told me with the greateſt gravity imaginable that he had ſet up two Turn-Pikes to hinder the people from preſſing to the gate. He paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the reſt of the Meal in ſuch fopperies, which ſufficiently diſcovered his incapacity and folly</p>
            <p>After Dinner he told me he had received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> to hear the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals I had to make, and give him account of them. He called for Paper and Ink; and writ down all I encharged him with. Then I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved I had happened on the right means of ſaving my life, and prolonging affairs. I made him a deſcription of the condition of <hi>France,</hi> not ſuch as it really was, but ſuch as the Spaniards deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have it: I aſſured him of the general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of Perſons of Quality, and the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Provinces to an Inſurrection: that there were few Governors that might not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be gained, that many of them depended on me, that ſome, and thoſe very conſiderable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to me: that the Armies inclined to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: that the Parliaments jealous of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Chief Miniſter, were deſirous of novelty: In a word, that all men being reduced to deſpair, there wanted only a head towards a general ſubverſion: that I was of a Family ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well beloved, very conſiderable and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as had appeared in former ages: that being incenſed by ill uſage, and by having been aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:57207:324"/>
in the enterpriſe of <hi>Naples,</hi> I was reſolved for the higheſt undertakings, being certain to be followed by the gallanteſt and conſiderableſt of the Nobility, who would freely concern themſelves in my reſentments, and contribute to my revenge, could they ſee the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of being aſſiſted. I added all things that could appear probable, making them ſeem ſo eaſie, that he perſwaded himſelf I had greater credit than all my Predeceſſors ever had, and that I ſtood in need of nothing but the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Spain</hi> in order to all I pretended, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars whereof I in ſuch a manner ſet out to him, that he ſhould no longer have believed himſelf to have been a good Spaniard, if he had been capable of diſtruſting them. From this paſſing to diſcourſe of the affairs of <hi>Naples,</hi> I offered to ſettle the whole Kingdom in a very few dayes, to ſupply the Town with proviſions in abundance, diſarm the people, and prevent all forreign correſpondencies, yet with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that I would never diſcover any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets that had been entruſted to me, being a Perſon of too great honour to do ſo, how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied ſoever; but for all ſuch things as I had pried into by my addreſs, and which endeavors had been uſed to have concealed from me, I would declare with joy, ſo to ruin all deſigns that might be a foot; not able to endure that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould make advantage by my ſhipwrack, or perſons not ſo conſiderable as my ſelf ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in an enterpriſe in which I had not been aſſiſted. At laſt making appear to him my Title
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:57207:324"/>
to the Dutchy of <hi>Modena,</hi> I brought him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge I was moſt proper to deprive the Duke of it, if I might be inveſted by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and have forces ſufficient to put my ſelf in poſſeſſion. He was over-joyed to have an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of ſuch importance in his hands, and looking on himſelf as a very great States-man, returned me thanks for having given him ſo handſome an occaſion to make his fortune, and after abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of complements took leave to go and make his diſpatches.</p>
            <p>Three or four dayes paſſed, during all which he continually entertained me on the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; diſcovering that he made great projects, and doubted not by means of the intrigues I had put into his hands, ere he died to obtain the dignity of Grandee of <hi>Spain.</hi> I fomented this vanity, becauſe it procured me better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and contributed towards diverting me, taking pleaſure to make him ridiculous: that time expired, he came to make me a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement in behalf of the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi>; telling me he had received Order from him to provide the beſt appartment of the Caſtle, commonly called the Kings, to lodge me. They furniſhed it very handſomely, and cauſed me to deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it after I had lain fourteen dayes in the Tower. I had a very large Hall, a fair Chamber, and a Cloſet, all on a Floor. The Guard continued all day at the Stair-head, and I had the liberty of the whole appartment to walke in, which had Windows on both ſides, one whereof looked into the Court of the Caſtle, where I had the
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:57207:325"/>
pleaſure of ſeeing people go in and out, and the other towards the Sea, with a very delightful Proſpect, where I could every day ſee them fiſh, and all Ships, Gallies, Brigantines, and Feluca's that paſſed to and fro between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Naples.</hi> My Windows were all bolted cloſe in the night, and the lock of my door fortified by two great bolts and a chain, fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Musketeers lay in my Hall, a Captain at my Beds-feet, and two Alfieres and a Serjeant in my Cloſet. They made me good cheer, and I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by this change of entertainment that my Negotiations began to have effect, and that if my life was not altogether ſecure, it was not yet in very great danger; and had it not been for the uncivil humor of Don <hi>Alvaro,</hi> whoſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and brutality every day gave me ſome vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, my Priſon had been very eaſie. They already ſpoke to me of the Spaniſh intereſts, as if I had been very much concerned in them, and I laughed within my ſelf to find I had to do with people that would ſuffer themſelves to be abuſed ſo groſly, and believe ſo lightly. As ſoon as the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> had received that diſpatch, he ſent me a Cook, and an Officer to ſerve me, on condition they ſhould alwayes ſtay below, and never come into my appartment.</p>
            <p>One of my ſervants called <hi>Caillet,</hi> not freed from the apprehenſion he had the day I was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner, finding no Horſe at <hi>Poſilippo</hi> when I went from thence, followed me two leagues a foot, at the end whereof he was taken, and falling into the hands of the Countrey people,
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:57207:325"/>
a Butcher came to cut off his head with a great Knife, the Curate of the Town confeſſing him, the Butcher wearied with the tediouſneſs of his Confeſsion, knocking with his Knife on a Block that was there purpoſely for that execution, called out to him to diſpatch, when an Officer very luckily coming in, ſaved his life, taking him out of their hands, to carry him with the reſt of my ſervants to priſon to the <hi>New Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> came to make me a complement in the name of the Viceroy, and to tell me that he would ſend my Propoſals into <hi>Spain,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn me anſwers as ſoon as he received them. I ſhould have been very much ſatisfied by ſeeing my affairs in ſo good a way, had I not been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the news I received that ſome of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, eſpecially the Foot-men I brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> were condemned to the Gallies. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of this injuſtice, repreſenting that if I were a priſoner of war, my ſervants were to be returned to me, becauſe I would pay their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; and if I were a priſoner of State, that it was unjuſt that they ſhould ſuffer, becauſe they ſerved me not as Counſellors, nor gave any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for my coming to aſsiſt the people of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and favour their revolt. Theſe reaſons (though juſt) were not taken into conſideration, and that tyrannical reſolution was executed, which provoked me to revenge, and on which the oftner I think, the more violently I reſent it: but diſsimulation being neceſſary (after all applications had proved uſeleſs) I ſpoke no more

of it; and to perſwade them of my dependance on the intereſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> I complied with the requeſt the Viceroy made me, to give him my opinion in what manner he was to comport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſent him a Breviate of all the Corn I had laid up, with the price and places where it was, and taught him the expedient of raiſing a Stock of Two hundred thouſand Crowns, by cauſing a hundred Merchants, whoſe Names I ſent him, to lend him every one of them Two thouſand, to buy what ſhould be neceſſary, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple feeling no more want, might be pacified; and that I might cauſe the deaths of thoſe that had deſigned againſt my life, who were moſt capable of giving him trrouble, as the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents of <hi>Gennaro</hi>; I ſent him the names of about five and thirty, with aſſurance that if he cauſed them to be hanged, he needed not fear any Commotion in the Town. This was put in execution in all points, and I had the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſee him revenge me on thoſe I had not time to puniſh my ſelf. A few dayes after, with a great deal of joy I heard news of the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Gennaro</hi> and all his Confederates. As for <hi>Onoffrio Piſſacani, Carlo Longobardo,</hi> and <hi>Cicio Battimiello,</hi> who alwayes ſerved me faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, I ſent him word he might confide in them, that I would be reſponſible for them with my head, that they ſhould advertiſe him of all that paſſed in the Town, diſcover forreign Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies, facilitate his diſarming the people, and keeping all quiet; and that I might lay an
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:57207:327"/>
obligation upon them to do this, I writ to them that having paſſed my word for them, they ought moſt exactly to make good what I had promiſed, which otherwiſe my head muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and that doing ſo they had nothing to fear. In ſuch a manner I ruined my enemies, and preſerved three perſons that were very dear to me: and the Viceroy having made uſe of my counſel to his advantage, perſwaded himſelf that I was very faithful to <hi>Spain,</hi> and my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation neceſſary to him; but his pride and the abſolute ſubmiſſion he required to all his humors quickly embroiled us.</p>
            <p>They ſent me from <hi>Rome</hi> Cloths, Linnen, and other Neceſſaries, with Two thouſand Crowns in money for my preſent occaſions. He ordered my Guards ſhould firſt be paid out of this ſumme, which Don <hi>Alvaro de la Torre</hi> ſo punctually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, that he took for himſelf and his Officers a Quarters Pay by advance, with the charge of the reparations that had been made in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> to accommodate his Lodging and mine. He ordered Houſhold-ſtuffe to be made for me, and ſo entirely conſumed this ſumme, that more muſt needs be ſent for for me to live upon. I told him that no priſoners ever paid for their Guards in <hi>France,</hi> neither would I, which I might be blamed for, as giving an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ill conſequence: that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors at <hi>Rome</hi> might regulate this difficulty, to whom I would ſubmit; and that in the mean time he ought to treat me well, becauſe he had money enough in his hands to do
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:57207:328"/>
it. He told me there was nothing left, the pay of my Guards having been deducted, which muſt ever be done in the firſt place from what money ſoever I ſhould receive. I aſſured him that till this controverſie were decided, I would give notice that no more money ſhould be ſent me, but what was abſolutely neceſſary to keep me.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after, having received Letters from the Viceroy, he told me that point was to be no more conteſted, nor referred to any; that the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> would be obeyed, and give no other reaſon for what he did than his will to have it ſo; I replied he was not Maſter of my will, nor could diſpoſe of it, though my perſon were in his power; and that ſince it came to a Conteſt which of us two ſhould be moſt obſtinate, I would yield in nothing, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to preſerve the only liberty that remained to me, which was that of my will. This laid me liable to a great deal of ill uſage; they refuſed to deliver me the Clothes and Linnen that had been ſent me, and for the ſpace of three moneths I was all in raggs, wearing the Boots I had been taken in for want of ſhooes, eating nothing but Bread and a little freſh Pork (and not my Belly full of that) unleſs on Faſting-dayes, when (Fiſh coſting nothing) we made a little better cheer, ſuppoſing they ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me by this bad uſage: but thinking my ſelf concerned in honour to ſuffer it patiently, I made Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> mad to ſee my contempt of this, telling him that inſtead of diſ obliging,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:57207:328"/>
he did me the greateſt pleaſure in the world, by giving me a trial whether I were as able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the famine of a Siege as I thought I was to reſiſt the attacques of it.</p>
            <p>His ſpite againſt me was augmented by a very pleaſant adventure. The Great Duke ſending a Gentleman to complement Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Ognate,</hi> on their happy recovery of the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> writ to me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo on occaſion of my misfortune, and fearing it might give ſome alteration to my health, ſent me a Cabinet of Medicaments of his own Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory. Don <hi>Alvaro de la Torre</hi> had Order to deliver me both theſe, and receive my anſwer in token of it. As ſoon as he underſtood that Gentleman was gone from <hi>Naples,</hi> in order to his return for <hi>Florence,</hi> he ſent Captain <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co d' Herrera</hi> to me one morning, to demand to have the Cabinet in his cuſtody, of which I might keep the Key. I anſwered I would ſend for it after Dinner to give it him, and doing ſo, I told him, I ſee Sir that you are afraid there may be ſomething in this Cabinet to poyſon my Guards, or caſt them into a ſleep, or to mollifie the Iron Bars of the Windows: I aſſure you it contains nothing but defenſive arms, and if you had any ſuſpition, it had been handſomer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have delivered it me, than to demand it again after ſeven or eight dayes; but I will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you, as it is reaſonable I ſhould, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it before him, having read all the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the Viols and little Pots, that were in it, broke as many of them, one after another,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:57207:329"/>
as were for Wounds, Cholick, Ill Stomack, Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the like, but finding an Oil and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that were good againſt Poyſon, ſmiling told him this may be uſeful to me, therefore be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that I may keep it; neither ſhall you have it but by force; which when you go about to make uſe of for taking it from me, I will call for a Confeſſor: This diſcourſe ſurpriſed him, and he asked me if I thought the Spaniards ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch actions? I very calmly anſwered him yes and of worſe, which is much againſt their will that they have not made me ſenſible of to my coſt, but my good fortune ſecured me. He replied in heat, If the King my Maſter had any intention to take away your life, he needed not have recourſe to ſuch a manner of doing it, for if he commanded me, I would ponyard you. Then looking on him with contempt, I told him, Your Nation reſpects too much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, to act ſo publick violences, and do not think that I either fear or eſteem you the more for what you have told me, you have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let me know that you are fit to do that which the Hang-man does commonly. He went enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of my Chamber, to write a Letter of much complaint, to which he received no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer but that he was to blame, and that he ought to have more diſcretion than to ſay any thing that might provoke a diſpleaſing anſwer.</p>
            <p>We had another quarrel five or ſix dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſomething hotter than the former. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been bred Page to the Duke of <hi>Medina de
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:57207:329"/>
los Torres,</hi> he could not imagin that under Kings there was any thing in <hi>Europe</hi> equal to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and told me very unſeaſonably, that he could not comprehend what it was to be a Prince, which well conſidered was but a Chimera and meer imagination; and that the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> were at leaſt equal to Princes. I told him I pitied his ignorance, and therefore would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him, that I thought he was not ſo ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed but he knew what it was to be a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: that to be a Prince it was not enough to be deſcended of a Soveraign Family, and from a Soveraign Head, but there muſt be a capacity to inherit a Soveraignty: that there was a great deal of difference between Princes and Grande's of <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe Kings could not make Princes but in Bed, and that for making a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> there needed no more but to cauſe the meaneſt fellow in the World to put on his Hat: that therefore they gave their Infanta's to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which they never did yet to any Grandee. He tranſported himſelf too far on this Subject, and perceiving him begin to talk very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, I told him, that the misfortune of a priſoner of my quality was great enough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the augmentation of diſreſpect, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired he would not continue, leaſt he made me forget that I was a priſoner, and be more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that I was a Prince: and that to what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever I might be reduced, I could very well cauſe that to be rendered me that belonged to me. He making an inſolent reply, I ſtruck at his head with the Candleſtick, which I had broken,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:57207:330"/>
had he not had the luck to have ducked betimes. He made haſte out of my Chamber, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door after him, locked me in. He ſaw me not in two dayes, in which time he waited for the Viceroy's anſwer to his complaints, which was not very ſatisfactory to him, becauſe he was commanded to come and ask my pardon, which he did putting one knee on the ground as I went to Maſs two dayes after. I embraced him with aſſurance that I had forgotten all that had paſſed, and very willingly pardoned him, provided he would be more diſcreet for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>I could never paſs over five or ſix dayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſuch encounters either with him or his Officers, whoſe humor when I had diſcovered, I reſolved to ſuffer nothing from them, but on the contrary to hold them in a great ſubjection. The Spaniſh Genius being alwayes inſolent to thoſe that live civilly with them, and fawning to ſuch as uſe them with contempt.</p>
            <p>I will not repeat all Negotiations that paſſed during the time of my impriſonment, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to extend my <hi>Memoires</hi> ſo far; I ſhall only relate ſome more than ordinary adventures that happened, for my particular ſatisfaction, and to publiſh my uſage and the impertinence of my Keepers, with the manner alſo of my deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them. Three or four moneths after, a man called <hi>Harpin</hi> was ſent by my relations to viſit me, he was admitted, and brought me Three hundred Crowns for three Moneths Diet, I not permitting any more to be ſent me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:57207:330"/>
my Guards would have it, to whom I had no obligation, they not allowing me ſo much as liberty to walk on the Terraſſes of the Caſtle, and inſtead of diverting gave me ſtill the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience (notwithſtanding I was locked up) to be maliciouſly looked upon by three or four ill-favoured and very uncivil fellows. After <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> had made me the complements he had been encharged with, Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> very hungrily asked him what money he had brought? He anſwered only Three hundred Crowns for three Moneths Diet, the King not conſenting that I ſhould pay my Guards. Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> replied he would take that ſumme upon account for himſelf and them. I forbid the Meſſenger to part with it, and commanded him to return and carry it back with him. I had forgotten to tell how, (that I might be no more ſeen in ſuch diſorder as formerly) they had delivered me the Clothes that had been ſent me from <hi>Rome</hi> three Moneths before. Don <hi>Alvaro</hi> enraged to find nothing to content his inſatiable avarice, turning towards Captain <hi>Ambroſio Fernandez,</hi> that had the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of my proviſions, told him, to morrow let there not be ſo much as a loaf of bread for the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> I ſaid, His Nation would loſe too much by the death of a priſoner of my conſideration, and that I was ſure he would not refuſe me ammunition bread, which was allowed to the meaneſt ſoldier in the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Gaeta.</hi> He replied, He had no Order for it, and I, That I reſolved to trie whether he
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:57207:331"/>
would ſtarve me. <hi>Harpin</hi> having taken leave greedineſs of the little money he had brought, obliged Don <hi>Alvaro de la Torre</hi> to ſend Captain <hi>Ambroſio Fernandez</hi> after him, to demand the Three hundred Crowns in my name, telling him I had changed my mind for fear of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for hunger; which he himſelf acquainting me with, I ranted him for having made uſe of my name contrary to my intention, and he replying inſolently that I uſed him very ill for a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Captain, laying my hand on the guard of my Sword, which they had not taken from me, I went up to him threatning to make him leap the window, which cauſed him to make haſte to the door, in ſome dayes after never daring to appear before me. I deſired leave to pawn my Clothes for Victuals, which was permitted, and I did it, even to Silk-ſtockings, pieces of Ribbon, perfumed Gloves, and Hat-bands, which I fed on almoſt three moneths; after which writing to <hi>Rome</hi> to have my Clothes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, it was done conditionally, that I ſhould pawn them no more.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Cellimare,</hi> to whom I had Order to addreſs my ſelf in my concernments, writ to me to oblige me to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Viceroy, after which he aſſured me I ſhould be better treated, and allowed more liberty. My anſwer conſiſted in tart railleries, to enrage them againſt me. He ſent me every week from <hi>Naples</hi> Lemmons and Sugar, with which I made Lemonade, with Cheeſe, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:57207:331"/>
good Wine which I kept in my Cloſet. Once he ſent me ſix Capons and as many Gammons of Bacon, on which I feaſted as long as they would laſt: beſides which, in what indiſpoſition ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I found my ſelf, I could not obtain ſo much as a meſs of Broth: and he was ſent to to make me no more ſuch preſents. Donna <hi>Elvira</hi> wife to the Lieutenant of the Caſtle, that had ſome kindneſs for me, and was touched with compaſſion to ſee me ſo ill treated, furniſhed me with Wheat, of which my Servants made me paſſable bread, and now and then ſent me Chocolate and ſome diſh of meat that ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared very deliciouſly, but this was not ſuffered long.</p>
            <p>There were not above thirty men in Garriſon in the Caſtle of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> ſome of which were Portugueſes: this cauſed me to reſolve to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to gain them, and try whether I could make my ſelf Maſter of it. I wrought ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly and with ſuch ſucceſs, that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtrickt Guards that were upon me, I made ſure of nine ſoldiers, the moſt of them Portugueſes, of two Serjeants of my Guard, and two other of the Garriſon, which joyning with us five Frenchmen, made in all eighteen perſons; my deſign was when we went to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute our enterpriſe, to ſet at liberty five or ſix Neapolitan priſoners, and at the return of the French Fleet, which was a third time expected, ſend one of thoſe Serjeants (which often paſſed between <hi>Gaeta</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> to carry Letters) to
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:57207:332"/>
give notice to him that commanded, that he ſhould ſail right for <hi>Gaeta,</hi> where I had ſo well prepared all things, that nothing could prevent my making my ſelf Maſter of the Caſtle, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the throats of all the Garriſon. I intended to begin with the four Officers that lay in my Chamber, whom the Knight of <hi>Eſſars,</hi> my man and I were to kill in the night while they ſlept, having provided raſors to that effect. But having waited two moneths for this without any news, the Serjeant I moſt truſted, and that had liberty of going to <hi>Naples,</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that the buſineſs would be at laſt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, deſired his Paſs and became a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin.</p>
            <p>This deſign ſo well laid, and which I thought infallible, failed in this manner, after having been carried on with ſo much fidelity and ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that there was no diſcovery, nor the leaſt ſuſpicion of it: which makes appear that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is impoſſible to reſolution and courage; and that Priſons enlarge mens inventions, and cauſe them to undertake ſuch things as they could never once imagine if they were at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>My ſervants troubled to ſee me fare ſo ill, could not forbear murmuring; and <hi>Don Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> that treated himſelf very well in his Chamber, and came afterwards for form's ſake to eat with me, one day at dinner complained of it, and asked if it were by my Order that my men ſaid it was impoſſible that it ſhould be by command
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:57207:332"/>
of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or conſent of the Earl of <hi>Ognate,</hi> but that probably it was himſelf that obliged me to thoſe Faſts, that he might keep the money appointed for my Table. I anſwered him that perſons of quality would never value the diſcourſe of ſervants, and that mine were more excuſable, if the irkſomneſs of the priſon made them utter ſome impertinences, he knowing I converſed not with them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be reſponſible for their words. I prayed him to ſpeak no more of it, becauſe not worth the while: but perſiſting to repeat over and over the ſame thing, and earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of me what I thought of it, I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he preſsed me too much, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me to tell him, that the imprudence of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſometimes publiſhed that which their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with a great deal of reaſon thought, though their diſcretion obliged them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it. He went out of my Chamber very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, and returning an hour after acompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by Don <hi>Martin de Verrio,</hi> a Colonel and Governour of the City of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> with two Captains of the Garriſon, told me he had brought them to be witneſſes of the explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he would make me of our late diſcourſe. I replied, that neither my quality nor humor could receive it, and that it was very unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for him (the condition I was in conſidered) to have ſuch a thought. My honour (ſaid he) is concerned, and therefore I deſire (in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of theſe Gentlemen) to hear your opinion
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:57207:333"/>
of me. I have too good a one, ſaid I, of the Viceroy, to attribute to him the ill uſage I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and I believe (as it is probable) that he hath appointed all things neceſſary to my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (in ſuch manner as belongs to a priſoner of my quality) the failings of which muſt needs proceed from you, by diverting the allowance to your own particular profit. Incenſed by my reply, he haſtily told me that he was a poor ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, but did all things with honour. I believe, ſaid I, that you are poor, ſince you comport your ſelf like a man that would very fain become rich; but for ſoldier, God having forbidden us to judge raſhly, and never having ſeen you on ſervice, it is not fit that <hi>I</hi> ſay any thing. He cried out, you attacque my honor, but if you were in another condition, I would let you ſee I want neither that nor courage. You uſe me ſo ill, replied <hi>I,</hi> that I will have nothing to do with you, for you make me loſe all conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but if you have ſuch courage and honour as you would have us believe, perſiſt, and put me in a condition to give you ſatisfaction, and then I ſhall learn, either at your coſt or mine own, what opinion I ought to have of you. He grew mad with choler and vented a thouſand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences. Don <hi>Martin de Verrio,</hi> a very diſcreet and gallant perſon, told him, he fondly brought trouble upon himſelf by his imprudence, and that the Viceroy would not approve his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence and loſs of reſpect to me on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I beſought him to be a witneſs of what had
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:57207:333"/>
paſſed, and to conſider whether it muſt not of neceſſity be very inſupportable, beſides the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors of a Priſon, to be every day liable to ſuch extravagancies; afterwards they took leave, and Don <hi>Alvaro</hi>'s paſſion was ſo high, that he ſaw me no more in two dayes, which I could very well have excuſed; not thinking it any loſs to have been deprived of his entertainment: but then Don <hi>Martin de Verrio</hi> bringing him to me as I went to Maſs, he caſt himſelf on his knees to beg my pardon, according to the Order he had received from the Earl of <hi>Ognate,</hi> beſeeching me to forget his imprudence and want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which I promiſed, provided he would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be more diſcreet.</p>
            <p>Four or five dayes after he came to me to ask my counſel, whether he ſhould not wrong him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by accepting the command of the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy's Company of <hi>Gendarmes,</hi> made up of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formado Officers, the greateſt part of them Captains of Horſe. I ſeriouſly told him he ſhould do himſelf a very great injury, and that it was too much below him; that I might not prevent him from breaking his neck, as I ſaw he went about to do. He held himſelf to be obliged by my counſel, which very much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, becauſe it ſuited with his own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thanking the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he pretended to do him, beſought him to have the goodneſs to allow him time to adviſe with his friends, whether he could with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and without prejudice to his reputation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:57207:334"/>
it: but if he pleaſed to beſtow upon him the Government of <hi>Reggio</hi> he ſhould like it much better: that in the mean time he ſhould highly oblige him by giving him leave to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to confer with his Brother, who was Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Agent in that Court. By this anſwer he perfectly loſt the Viceroy, who ſent him word he had done him more honour than he deſerved, having preferred him to perſons much more conſiderable than himſelf; that he would ſee to make a better choice: that the Government of <hi>Reggio</hi> being already given, it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for him to pretend to it, nor to any other favor that depended on him: that he ſhould do very well to go and viſit his Brother, of whoſe inſtructions he had a great deal of need, to make him more wiſe and conſiderate for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Whileſt he was on his journey, Order being come from <hi>Spain</hi> to ſend me thither, the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy cauſed the Galley of <hi>John Andrea Brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolle,</hi> the beſt of the Duke of <hi>Turſi</hi>'s Squadron to be made ready, ſending the Prince <hi>de Celli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare</hi> Deacon of the Council to give all Orders neceſſary for my embarking, with all poſſible ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and honour, as had been expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s diſpatch, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his deſire to ſee and confer with me about the Propoſals I had made, which had been ſent him. He cauſed him to be accompanied by a Secretary of his a Burgundian, called Don <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward de Francalmont,</hi> whom I had formerly
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:57207:334"/>
known in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who made me a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement in his name, excuſing himſelf of all the ill uſage I had received, which could not be diſpenſed withal, becauſe I was in a Kingdom whoſe rebellion I had a long time ſupported, and where authority and obedience were not altogether ſettled: but had I been any where elſe he ſhould have dealt with me in a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner, and by his care to ſerve and oblige me, have made it appear how great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration he had for a perſon of my merit and quality. I anſwered theſe civilities with all imaginable acknowledgments. He told me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that his Maſter had a great eſteem and friendſhip for me in <hi>Rome,</hi> though he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me at that time as the moſt dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> which obliged him by the rules of policy to ſeek my ruin by all wayes: notwithſtanding which he had taken care of my preſervation, in ſeveral times refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the offers had been made to attempt my life by ſword and poyſon.</p>
            <p>Having at that inſtant about me wherewithal to prove the contrary, ſo vain a diſſimulation offended me, and I anſwered him that I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much obliged to the Earl of <hi>Ognate</hi> for his good inclinations towards me, to have refuſed to take my life that had been ſo often offered him: but that as ſeveral hours of the day bring ſeveral changes upon us, he had perhaps for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that he cauſed a promiſe of Six thouſand Crowns to be given to <hi>Cicio de Regina,</hi> and a
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:57207:335"/>
Commiſſion for a Troop of Horſe (which I ſhewed him) to have killed me the Twenty fifth of <hi>March</hi> in the Church of the <hi>Annunciata,</hi> which I learned by the Confeſſion he made on the Rack, and confirmed at his death: that I had no prejudice for him on accompt of it, it being juſt that he ſhould ſerve the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and the condition into which I had reduced his affairs conſidered, I could not blame him to have recourſe to all manner of means for ridding himſelf of me; but yet I could not chuſe but tell him that I ſhould have thought my ſelf much more obliged if I had found greater ſincerity in his civilities, and that they had not been carried on to ſo great an exceſs, that I had unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my hands wherewithal to contradict them. <hi>Francalmonte</hi> deſired me to give him the two Papers I had ſhewn him, that he might burn them, and eternally deſtroy their memory: but I replied, that were to do his Maſter ill ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for I intended to ſhew them to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to make appear to him that he had a Viceroy in <hi>Naples</hi> that omitted nothing to do him ſervice, and ſettle his Throne, that had been ſo long time tottering.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Cellimare</hi> ſpoke of nothing to me but the good uſage and careſſes I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in <hi>Spain</hi>; where I was expected with great impatience: that I ſhould not be long without my liberty, becauſe my credit, courage, and reſentments were very much depended on, the preſent diſorders of <hi>France</hi> conſidered: that I
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:57207:335"/>
ſhould have all neceſſary aſſiſtance to drive them to the uttermoſt extremity; and that <hi>Spain</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped great advantages from her confidence in me; where I ſhould alſo find my eſtabliſhment and fortune. After this he told me he was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to acquaint me with the impriſonment of ſome Gentlemen of my friends, whom he named to me, that were in danger of their lives, for their too near correſpondencies with me, of which if I pleaſed I could give him a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account. I anſwered him diſcontentedly, If the Viceroy be curious to enquire into the intrigues between me and the Nobility, <hi>Caeſar Blanco, Achilles Minutulo,</hi> and you Sir can inform him, becauſe you were the Mediators of them, and you very well know that I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed all three of you the preſervation of your Eſtates and Employments. He was ſurprized with fear, conjuring me not to ruin him, and above all not to mention in <hi>Spain</hi> what had paſſed. I told him you do not take the way to prevent me, you move me againſt my friends, inſult over my misfortune, and your ſelf and two Camerades being of the Collateral Council, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the cutting off my head, hoping by my death to prevent the diſcovery of the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with me.

            <p>Don <hi>Alvaro de la Torre,</hi> hearing that I was to be tranſported into <hi>Spain,</hi> made haſte from <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might have the conduct of me, expecting ſome great reward before his return, which the Prince of <hi>Cellamare</hi> having acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with, I told him that though my joy was great to begin a Voyage that probably might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me to liberty, I would not go (unleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to it) with a man that had dealt ſo ill with me; and that they muſt carry me bound into the Galley, or I ſhould never embark. He anſwered, If that perſon were diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me, another ſhould be appointed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they reſolved to give me all manner of ſatisfaction: they therefore choſe in his ſtead Don <hi>Antonio de Areazano,</hi> who ſhortly after obtained the government of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> vacant by the death of the Prince of <hi>Aſcoli.

He was abſolutely loſt, and had nothing to pretend, when Don <hi>John de Morgareio</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Castello No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> died happily for him, and the Duke of <hi>Medina do los Torres</hi> his Maſter, who is perpetual Governor of it, made him Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant.</p>
            <p>I drew this advantage from my impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I made it apparent to all <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> (what opinion ſoever had paſſed to the contrary) that my credit and particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration only maintained all in arms in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>; for at the news of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Town by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> none were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but as ſoon as ever they heard of my reſtraint, they laid down their arms, in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that my intereſts alone and not the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hatred kept alive the war: and as ſoon as I was out of condition to act, they all returned to their fetters, without any thought of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering themſelves, but under my command and authority.</p>
