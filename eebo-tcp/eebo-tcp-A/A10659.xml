            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Something still there is without him, unto which he moves, and from whence God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that he should reape either preservation in, or advancement and perfection unto his nature. What that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16278:12"/>
is upon which the desires of man ought to fixe as his Rest and End, is the maine discoverie that the Wise Man makes in this Booke. And he doth it by an historicall and penitentiall review of his former Enquiries; from whence he states the point in Two maine Conclusions. The first the <hi>Creatures Insufficiencie,</hi> in the beginning of the Booke, <hi>Vanitie of Vanities, All is vanity.</hi> The second <hi>Mans Duty</hi> to God, and Gods All-sufficiencie unto man, in the End of the Booke, <hi>Let us heare the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>of the whole matter, Feare God, and keepe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, for this is Totum hominis,</hi> the whole Duty, the whole End, the whole Happinesse of Man. The former of these two, namely the Insufficiency of the Creature to satiate the desires, and quiet the motions of the Soule of man, is the point I am now to speake of, out of these words.</p>
                  <p>For understanding whereof, wee must know that it was not God in the Creation, but sinne and the curse which attended it, that brought this Vanity and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Creature. God made Every thing in it selfe very Good, and therefore very fit for the desires of man some way or other to take satisfaction from. As prickes, and quauers, and rests in musicke serue in their order to commend the cunning of the Artist, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the Eare of the hearer, as well as more perfect notes: so the meanest of the Creatures were at first fill'd with so much goodnesse, as did not onely declare the glory of God, but in their ranke likewise minister content to the minde of man. It was the sinne of man that fill'd<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 20, 22.</note> the Creature with Vanitie, and it is the Vanitie of the Creature that fils the Soule of man with Vexation. As<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 23.</note> sinne makes man come short of Glory, which is the rest of the Soule in the fruition of God in himselfe; so doth it make him come short of Contentation too, which is the rest of the Soule in the fruition of God in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Sinne tooke away Gods favour from the Soule,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16278:12"/>
and his Blessing from the Creature. It put bitternesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soule that it cannot relish the Creature, and it put Vanity into the Creature, that it cannot nourish nor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Soule.</p>
                  <p>The Desires of the Soule can never be satisfied with any Good, till they finde in it these two qualities or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, wherein indeed the formalitie of Goodnesse doth consist; namely <hi>Proportion</hi> and <hi>Proprietie.</hi> First nothing can satisfie the desires of the Soule till it beares conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and fitnesse thereunto; for it is with the minde as with the body, the richest attire that is if it be either too loose or too straite, however it may please a mans pride, must needs offend his body. Now nothing is Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the minde of man, but that which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto it as it is a spirituall Soule. For though a man have the same sensitive appetites about him which we finde in beasts; yet, in as much as that Appetite was in man created subordinate unto reason, and obedient to the spirit; the case is plaine, that it can never be fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with its obiect, unlesse that likewise be subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and linked to the Obiect of the superior faculty, which is God. So then the Creature can never bee Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Soule of Man, till it bring God along with it. So long as it is emptie of God, so long must it needs be full of <hi>Vanitie</hi> and <hi>Vexation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now it is not sufficient that there be <hi>Proportion,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse withall there be <hi>Propriety.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>Proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Good</hi> unto the nature of divels as well as of men or good angels, yet no good comes by that unto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is none of their God, they have no interest in him, they have no union unto him. Wealth is as commensurate unto the mind and occasions of a beggr as of a prince; yet the goodnesse and comfort of it extends not unto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath no propriety unto any. Now sinne hath taken away the <hi>Proprietie</hi> which we have in Good, hath unlinked that golden chaine, whereby the Creature was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16278:13"/>
joyned unto God, and God with the Creature came along unto the minde of man. So that till we can reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Vnion, and make up this breach againe, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for the Soule of man to receive any satisfaction from the Creature alone. Though a man may have the possession of it, as a <hi>Naked Creature,</hi> yet not the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, as a <hi>Good Creature.</hi> For <hi>Good the Creature</hi> is not unto any but by vertue of the Blessing and Word accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it. And man naturally hath no right unto the Blessing of the Creature; for it is Godlinesse which hath the Promises, and by consequence the Blessing as well of this as of the other life. And God is not in his favour reconciled unto us, nor reunited by his Blessing unto the Creature, but onely in and through Christ. So then the minde of a man is fully and onely satisfied with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when it findes <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> together in it: God making the Creature suteable to our inferior desires, and Christ making both God and the Creature Ours; <hi>God</hi> giving <hi>Proportion,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> giving <hi>Propriety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things thus explained, let us now consider the <hi>Insufficiencie</hi> of the Creature to conferre, and the <hi>Vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfiablenesse</hi> of the flesh to receive any solid or reall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from any of the workes which are done under the Sunne. Man is naturally a proud Creature, of high projects, of unbounded desires, ever framing to himselfe I know not what imaginarie and phantasticall felicities, which have no more proportion unto reall and true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, then a king on a stage to a king on a throne, then the houses which children make of cards, unto a princes palace. Ever since the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> he hath an itch in him to be a god within himselfe, the fountaine of his owne goodnesse, the contriver of his owne sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; loth hee is to goe beyond himselfe, or what hee thinkes properly his owne, for that in which hee resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to place his rest. But alas, after hee hath toil'd out his heart, and wasted his spirits, in the most exact inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

that the Creature could minister unto him, <hi>Salomon</hi> here, the most experienc'd for enquirie, the most wise for contrivance, the most wealthy for compassing such earthly delights, hath, after many yeeres sitting out the finest flowre, and torturing nature to extract the most exquisite spirits, and purest quintessence, which the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Creatures could afford, at last pronounced of them all, That they are <hi>Vanitie and vexation of spirit:</hi> Like Thornes, in their gathering they pricke, that is their <hi>Uexation,</hi> and in their burning they suddenly blaze and waste away, that is their <hi>Uanitie.</hi> Vanitie in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, fraile and perishable things; and Vexation in their enjoyment, they nothing but molest and disquiet the heart. <hi>The eye,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, is not satisfied with seeing, nor the eare with hearing.</hi> Notwithstanding they be the widest of all the senses, can take in more abundance with lesse satiety, and serue more immediately for the supplies of the reasonable Soule, yet a mans eye-strings may even cracke with vehemencie of poring, his eares may be filled with all the varietie of the most exquisite sounds and harmonies, and lectures in the world, and yet still his Soule within him be as greedy to see and heare more as it was at first. Who would have thought that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a prince, the adoration of the people, the most conspicuous honours of the court, the liberty of utterly destroying his most bitter adversaries, the sway of the sterne and universall negotiations of state, the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of all the happinesse, that wealth, or honour, or intimatenesse with the prince, or Deity with the people, or extremitie of luxurie could afford, would possibly have left any roome or nooke in the heart of <hi>Haman</hi> for discontent? and yet doe but observe, how the want of one Iewes knee (who dares not give divine worship to any but his Lord) blasts all his other glories, brings a damp upon all his other delights, makes his head hang downe, and his mirth wither: so little leaven was able to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16278:14"/>
sowre all the Queenes banquet, and the Kings favour. <hi>Ahab</hi> was a king, in whom therefore wee may justly expect a confluence of all the happinesse which his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions could afford; a man that built whole cities, and dwelt in Ivorie palaces, and yet the want of one poore Vineyard of <hi>Naboth</hi> brings such a heavinesse of heart, such a deadnesse of countenance on so great a person, as seemed in the judgement of <hi>Iezabel</hi> farre unbeseeming the honour and distance of a prince. Nay <hi>Salomon,</hi> a man every way more a king both in the minde and in the state of a king then <hi>Ahab,</hi> a man that did not use the Creature with a sensuall, but with a criticall fruition, <hi>To finde out that good which God had given men under the sunne,</hi> and that in such abundance of all things, learning, honour, pleasure, peace, plenty, magnificence, fortaine supplies, roiall visits, noble confederacies, as that in him was the patterne of a compleat prince beyond all the plat-formes and Ideas of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Zenophon;</hi> and yet even he was never able to repose his heart upon any or all these things together, till he brings in the feare of the Lord for the close of all. Lastly, looke on the people of Israel; God had delivered them from a bitter thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, had divided the sea before them, and destroied their enemies behind them, had given them bread from heaven, and fed them with angels foode, had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the rocke to satisfie their thirst, and made the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites to melt before them; his mercies were magnified with the power of his miracles, and his miracles crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the sweetenesse of his mercies, besides the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of great promises to bee performed in the holy land: and yet in the midst of all this wee finde nothing but murmuring and repining. God had given them meat for their faith, but they must have meate for their lust too; it was not enough that God shewed them mercies, unlesse his mercies were dressed up and fitted to their palate, <hi>They tempted God, and limited the holy one of</hi>

                     <hi>Israel,</hi> saith the Prophet. So infinitely unsatisfiable is the fleshly heart of man either with mercies or miracles, that bring nothing but the Creatures to it.</p>
                  <p>The ground whereof is the <hi>Vast disproportion</hi> which is betweene the Creature and the soule of man, whereby it comes to passe, that it is absolutely impossible for one to fill up the other. The soule of man is a substance of unbounded desires: and that will easily appeare if wee consider him in any estate, either <hi>Created</hi> or <hi>Corrupted.</hi> In his <hi>Created estate</hi> he was made with a Soule capable of more glory, then the whole earth or all the frame of nature, though changed into one Paradise, could haue afforded him: for he was fitted unto so much honour as an infinite and everlasting Communion with God could bring along with it. And now God never in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gave unto any Creature a propercapacitie of a thing, unto which hee did not withall implant such motions and desires in that Creature as should be some what sute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that capacitie, and which might (if they had beene preserved intire) haue brought man to the fruition of that Good which he desired. For notwithstanding it be true, That the glory of God cannot be attain'd unto, by the vertue of any action which man either can, or ever could haue performed: yet God was pleased out of <hi>Mercie,</hi> for the magnifying of his name, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of his glory, for the advancement of his Creature, to enter into Covenant with man, and for his naturall obedience to promise him a supernaturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And this, I say, was even then out of Mercie; in as much as <hi>Adams</hi> legall obedience of workes could no more in any vertue of its owne, but onely in Gods mercifull contract and acceptance, merit everlasting life, then our Evangelicall Obedience of faith can now. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the difference betweene the mercie of the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant (and it is a great difference) is this. God did out of mercie propose Salvation unto <hi>Adam</hi> as

an Infinite Reward of such a finite Obedience, as <hi>Adam</hi> was able by his owne created abilities to have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. As if a man should give a Day-laborer a hundred pound for his daies worke, which performe indeed hee did by his owne strength, but yet did not merit the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth part of that wages which he receives: But Gods mercy untous is this, That he is pleased to bestow upon us not onely the reward, but the worke and merit which procured the reward, that he is pleased in vs to reward another mans worke, even the worke of Christ our head; as if when one onely Captaine had by his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome discomfited and defeated an enemie, the prince notwithstanding should reward his alone seruice, with the advancement of the whole armie which he led. But this by the way. Certaine in the meane time it is, that God created man with such capacities and desires, as could not be limited with any or all the excellencies of his fellow and finite Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Nay looke even upon <hi>Corruptednature,</hi> and yet there we shall still discover this restlesnesse of the minde of man, though in an evill way, to promote it selfe: whence arise distractions of heart, thoughts for to morrow, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and inquisitions of the soule after infinite varieties of earthly things, swarmes of lusts, sparkles of endlesse thoughts, those secret flowings, and ebbes, and tempests, and Estuations of that sea of corruption in the heart of man, but because it can never finde any thing on which to rest, or that hath roome enough to entertaine so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and so endlesse a guest? Let us then looke a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the particulars of that great disproportion and Insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of any or all the Creatures under the sun to make up an adequate and suteable Happinesse for the soule of man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> here expresseth it in Two words, <hi>Vanitie</hi> and <hi>Uexation.</hi> From the first of these wee may observe a <hi>threefold disproportion</hi> betweene the Soule and the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16278:16"/>
Creatures. First in regard of their <hi>nature and worth,</hi> they are base in comparison of the Soule of man: When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> would shew the infinite distance betweene God and man in power and strength, he expresseth the basenesse of man by his vanitie, To be laid in the ballance, <hi>they are altogether lighter then vanitie.</hi> Psal. 62. 9. And surely if we waigh the Soule of man and all the Creatures under the Sunne together, we shall finde them lighter then Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie it selfe. All the Goodnesse and honour of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ariseth from one of these <hi>Two grounds:</hi> Either <hi>from mans coining or from Gods,</hi> either from <hi>Opinion</hi> imposed upon them by men, or from some <hi>Reall qualities,</hi> which they have in their nature. Many things there are which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have all that worth and estimation which they carry amongst men, not from their owne qualities, but from humane institution, or from some difficulties that attend them, or from some other outward Imposition. When a man gives monie for meate, we must not thinke there is any naturall proportion of worth betweene a piece of silver and a piece of flesh; for that worth which is in the meate is its owne, whereas that which is in the monie is by humane appointment. The like we may say for great titles of honour and secular degrees, though they bring authoritie, distance, reverence with them from other men, yet notwithstanding they doe not of themselves, by any proper vertue of their owne, put any solid and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall merit into the man himselfe. Honour is but the raising of the rate and value of a man, it carrie, nothing of substance necessarily along with it: as in raising the valuations of gold from twenty shillings, to twenty two, the matter is the same, only the estimation different. It is in the Power of the king to raise a man out of the prison like <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and give him the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>xt place unto himselfe. Now this then is a plaine argument of the great base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of any of these things incomparison of the Soule of man, and by consequence of their great disability to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16278:17"/>
the same: for can a man make any thing equall to himselfe? can a man advance a piece of gold or silver in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reasonable, a spirituall, an eternall substance? A man may make himselfe like these things, he may debase him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the vilenesse of an Idoll, <hi>They that make them are like unto them;</hi> hee may under-value and uncoyne himselfe, blot out Gods Image and Inscription, and write in the image and inscription of earth and Satan, he may turne himselfe <hi>into brasse and iron and reprobate silver,</hi> as the Prophet speakes; but never can any man raise the Creatures by all his estimations to the worth of a man: we cannot so much as change the color of a haire or adde a cubite to our stature, much lesse can we make any thing of equall worth with our whole selves. We read indeed of some which have sold the righteous, and that at no great rate neither, for <hi>a paire of shooes.</hi> Ioel   3. 6. Amos 2. 6. but we see there how much the Lord abhorr'd that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable fact, and recompenc'd it upon the necke of the oppressors. How many men are there still that set grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rates upon their owne profits, or libertie, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or secular accommodations, then on the Soules of men, whose perdition is oftentimes the price of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements? but yet still Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule must hold, <hi>For meat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

We were not redeemed with silver and gold from our vaine Conversation, saith the Apostle 1. Pet. 1. 18. and therefore these things are of too base a nature to be put into the ballance with the soules of men; and that man infinitely undervalues the worke of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Image of God, the bloud of God, who for so base a purchase as monie, or preferment any earthly and vaine-glorious respect doth either hazard his owne, or     betray the Soules of others commended to him.</p>
                  <p>And therefore this should reach all those upon whom
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16278:17"/>
the Lord hath bestow'd a greater portion of this Opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native felicitie, I meane, of money, honour, reputation, or the like; First <hi>not to Trust</hi> in uncertaine Riches, not to relie upon a foundation of their owne laying for matter of Satisfaction to their Soule, nor to boast in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their riches, as the Prophet speakes, Psal. 49. 6. (for that is certainely one great effect of the Deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Riches, spoken of Matth. 13. 22. to perswade the Soule that there is more in them then indeed there is) and the Psalmist gives an excellent reason in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> same place, <hi>No man can by any meanes redeeme his brother, nor give to God a ransome for him, for the Redemption of their Soule is Pretious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And secondly, it may teach them as not to Trust, so <hi>not to Swell</hi> with these things neither. It is an argument of their windinesse and emptinesse that they are apt to make men swell; whereas if they cannot change a haire of a mans head, nor adde an inch to his stature, they can much lesse make an accession of the least dramme of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or reall value to the owners of them. And surely if men could seriously consider, That they are still mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the same common bodie, and that of a twofold body, a civill and a mysticall body, and that though they haplie may bee the more honorable parts in one body, yet in the other they may be the lesse honorable; that the poore whom they despise may in <hi>Christs</hi> body have a higher roome then they (as the Apostle saith, Hath not God chosen <hi>the poore in this world, Rich in faith, Iam.</hi> 2. 5.) I say, if men could compare things rightly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and consider that they are but the greater letters in the same volume, and the poore the smaller, though they take up more roome, yet they put no more matter nor worth into the word which they compound, they would never suffer the tympanie and inflation of pride or superciliousnesse, of selfe-attributions, or contempt of their meaner brethren to prevaile within them. Wee see
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16278:18"/>
in the naturall body though the head have a Hat on of so many shillings price, and the foot a Shooe of not halfe so many pence, yet the head doth not therefore despise the foot, but is tender of it, and doth derive influence as well unto that as to any nobler part: and surely so should it be amongst men, though God have given thee an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent station in the body, cloath'd thee with purple and scarlet, and hath set thy poore neighbour in the lowest part of the body, and made him conversant in the dirt, and content to cover himselfe with leather, yet you are still members of the same common body, animated with the same spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> moulded out of the same dirt, appointed for the same inheritance, borne out of the same<note place="margin">Ex eodem utero ignorantiae.

                  <p>Secondly, consider that Goodnesse and value which is fix'd to the being of the Creature, implanted in it by God and the institution of nature, and even thus we shall finde them absolutely unable to satisfie the desires of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and spirituall soule. God is the Lord of all the Creatures, they are but as his severall monies, he coin'd them all. So much then of his Image as nay Creature hath in it, so much value and worth it carries. Now God hath more communicated himselfe unto man, then unto any other Creature; in his Creation we finde man made after the <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 1. 27.</note> similitude of God, and in his restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we finde God made after the <note n="i" place="margin">1.

Can a man carrie the world into hell with him to bribe the flames, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his tormentors? No saith the Psalmist, <hi>His glory shall not descend after him,</hi> Psal. 49. 17. but can hee buy out his pardon before he comes thither? no neither, <hi>the Redemption of a Soule is more pretious,</hi> vers. 8. we know the Apostle counts all things Dung, Phil. 3. 8. and will God take dung in exchange for a soule? Certainely, Beloved, when a man can sow grace in the furrowes of the field, when he can fill his barnes with glory, when he can get bagges full of salvation, when he can plow up heaven out of the earth and extract God out of the Creatures, then he may bee able to finde that in them which shall satisfie his desires. But till then, let a man have all the exquisitest Curiosities of nature heap'd into one vessell, let him be moulded out of the most delicate ingredients, and noblest principles that the world can contribute, let there be in his body a concurrency of all beauty and feature, in his nature an Eminence of all Sweetnesse and ingenuity, in his minde a conspiration of the politest, and most choice varieties of all kinde of learning, yet still the spirit of that man is no whit more valueable and pretious, no whit more proportionable to Eternall Happinesse, then the soule of a poore and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate begger.

                  <p>A second Branch of the disproportion between the soule of man and the Creatures, arising from the <hi>Vanitie</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is their <hi>Deadnesse, unprofitablenesse, inefficacie</hi> by any<note place="margin">Ier. 16. 19.</note> inward vertue of their owne to convey or preserue life in the Soule.

                     <hi>wine, and multiplied her silver and gold, &amp;c. but said of them, these are my rewards which my lovers have given me.</hi> But saith the Lord, so long as they trusted me, they rested upon a sure fountaine that would never faile them; with thee, saith the Psalmist, is the <hi>Fountaine of life:</hi> And<note place="margin">Psal. 36. 9.</note> so saith the Apostle too, <hi>Let your conversation be without covetousnesse,</hi> that is, Doe not make an Idoll of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doe not heape vessels full of monie together, and then thinke that you are all sure, the Creature hath no life in it, nay it hath no truth in it neither, there is deceit and cozenage in riches; but saith he, Let your conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 22.</note> be with contentment, consider that what you have is the <hi>dimensum,</hi> the portion which God hath allotted<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 8.</note> you, that foode which he findeth most convenient for you; he knowes that more would but cloy you with a surfet of pride or worldlinesse, that you have not wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, humility, faith, heavenly mindednesse enough to concoct a more plentifull estate; and therefore receive your portion from him, trust his wisedome and care over you, <hi>For he hath said, I will not faile thee nor forsake thee.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 5.</note> Well then, saith the Lord, so long as they rested on me, they rested upon a sure supply (All his mercies are <hi>sure</hi>

                     <hi>mercies</hi>) upon a <hi>Fountaine</hi> which would never faile<note place="margin">Act. 13. 34.</note> them: But when once they forsake mee, and will not trust their lives in my keeping, but with the prodigall will have their portion in their owne hands, their water in their owne <hi>Cisterns,</hi> their pits prove unto them but like <hi>lobs</hi> torrent, deepe and plentifull though they seeme<note place="margin">Iob 6. 18.</note> for a time, yet at length they make those ashamed that relied upon them. And so I finde the Prophets assuring us, that <hi>Israel</hi> which put so much confidence in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<note place="margin">1. King. 12. 26.</note> policies of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> for preserving the kingdome of the ten tribes from any re-union with the house of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> was at last constrained to blush at their owne<note place="margin">Ier 48 13. Esai 30 3. Esai. 20. 5.</note> wisedome, and to be <hi>ashamed of Bethel their confidence.</hi> Briefly then for that place, there are two excellent things intimated in those two words of <hi>Cisterns</hi> and <hi>Broken Cisterns.</hi> First the wealth and honour which men get not from the Lord, but by carnall dependencies, are but <hi>Cisterns</hi> at the best, and in that respect they have an evill quality in them, they are like dead water, apt to putrifie and corrupt; being cut of from the influence of God the Fountaine of life, they have no favour nor sweetnesse in them. Besides they are <hi>Broken Cisterns</hi> too, as they have much mud and rottennesse in them, so they are full of chinkes, at which whatever is cleere and sweet runnes away, and nothing but dregges remaine behinde. The worldly pleasures which men enjoy, their youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vigor that carried them with delight and furie to the pursuite of fleshly lusts, the content which they were wont to take in the formalities and complements of courtship and good fellowship, with a storme of sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or at farthest a winter of age blowes all away, and then when the fruite is gone, there remaines nothing but the diseases of it behinde, which there surfet had begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, a conscience worme to torment the soule.</p>
                  <p>Thus the life which wee fetch from the Cisterne is a <hi>vanishing life,</hi> there is still, after the use of it, lesse left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16278:21"/>
then there was before: but the life which we fetch from the fountaine is a fixed, an <hi>Abiding life,</hi> as S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 15.</note> speakes, or, as our Saviour cals it, a <hi>Life that Abounds,</hi> like<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 10.</note> the pumping of water out of a fountaine, the more it is drawne, the faster it comes.</p>
                  <p>We grant indeed that the Lord, being the Fountaine of life, doth allow the Creature in regard of life tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall some subordinate operation and concurrencie in the worke of preserving life in us. But we must also remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, That the Creatures are but <hi>Gods Instruments</hi> in that respect: and that not as servants are to their masters, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving instruments, able to worke without concurrence of the superior cause; but <hi>Dead instruments,</hi> and therefore must never be separated from the <hi>Principall.</hi> Let God subduct from them that concourse of his owne which actuates and applies them to their severall services, and all the Creatures in the world are no more able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the body or to comfort the mind, then an axe and a hammer and those other dead instruments are able by themselues alone to erect some stately edifice. It is not the corne or the flowre, but the staffe of bread which supports the life, and that is not any thing that comes out of the earth, but something which comes downe from heaven, even the blessing which sanctifies the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for man liveth not by bread alone, but by the word which proceedeth out of Gods mouth. The Creature cannot hold up it selfe, much lesse contribute to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of other things, unlesse God continue the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his blessing upon it.

                  <p>For the first, The Creature is then sanctified, when the curse and poison which sin brought upon it is remooved, when we can use the Creature with a cleane conscience, and with assurance of a renewed and comfortable estate in them.

                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:16278:25"/>Now secondly, let us see <hi>How the Creature is sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By Word</hi> wee are not to understand the Word of Creation, wherein God spake and all things were made Good and serviceable to the use of man. For sinne came after that Word, and defaced as well the goodnesse which God put into the Creature, as his Image which he put into man. But by Word I understand first in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Gods Command and Blessing</hi> which strengtheneth the Creature unto those operations for which they serue: in which sense our Saviour useth it, Matth. 4. 4. and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>If ye call those Gods unto whom the Word of God</hi>

                     <hi>came,</hi> that is, who by Gods Authority and Commission are fitted for subordinate services of Gouernement under him, <hi>say ye of him whom the Father hath</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 5. Ioh. 6. 27. 37. 40. Act. 4. 27. Ioh. 10. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>sanctified,</hi> that is, to whom the Word of the Father and his Commission or Command came, to whom the Father hath given Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie by his <note n="z" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 22. 27. 30.

Ioh. 3. 34, 35.</note> Spirit to Iudge, and save the world, <hi>Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Sonne of God?</hi> Secondly, by that Word I understand more particularly <hi>the Fountaine of that Blessing,</hi> which the Apostle cals in generall the Word of Truth, and more particularly, <hi>The Gospell of Salvation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> and this word is a sanctifying Word; <hi>Sanctifie them by</hi>

                     <hi>thy truth, thy Word is Truth:</hi> and as it sanctifies us, so it sanctifies the Creatures too, it is the Fountaine not onely of Eternall, but of Temporall Blessings. And therefore we finde Christ did not onely say unto the sicke of the Palsie, <hi>Thy sinnes are forgiven thee,</hi> but also <hi>Arise and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 9. 2, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>walke,</hi> intimating, that Temporall Blessings come along with the Gospell, it hath the <hi>Promises as well of this life</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 8. Psal. 37. 25. Heb. 13. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>as that to come. I never saw the righteous forsaken,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>David</hi> (suteable to that of the Apostle, He hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee) <hi>nor their seed begging their bread;</hi> That is, never so wholly by God forsaken, if they were the seed of the Righteous,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16278:25"/>
inheritors of their fathers hope and profession, as to make a constant trade of begging their bread, and so to expose the promises of Christ, that they which seeke the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 33.</note> of heaven shall have all other things added to them, unto reproach and imputation from wicked men. Or thus, <hi>I never saw the righteous forsaken, or their seede forsaken</hi> by God, though they beg'd their bread, but even in that extremitie God was present with them, to sanctifie to their use, and to give them a comfortable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of that very bread which the exigencie of their present condition had constrained them to begge. Thus we see in generall, That <hi>the Blessing or Command of God,</hi> and the fountaine of that blessing, the <hi>Gospell of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> doe sanctifie the Creature.</p>
                  <p>But yet neither by the Blessing nor the Gospell is the Creature effectually <hi>sanctified unto us,</hi> till it be by us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended with the Word and Promise, and this is done<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2.</note> by <hi>Faith;</hi> for the Word, saith the Apostle, profited not those that heard it, because it <hi>was not mingled or temper'd</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>things,</hi> as the Apostle speakes, we likewise, in the vertue of our fellowship with him, must in a subordinate sense<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16278:26"/>
                     <hi>Austin,</hi> have All the world for their possession. And if it be here demanded how this can be true, since wee finde the Saints of God often in great want, and it would doubtlesse bee sinne in them to usurpe another mans goods upon presumption of that promise that Christ is theirs, and with him all things: To this I answere, first in generall, As Christ though he were the Heire of All<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 9.</note> things, yet for our sakes became poore, that we by his poverty might be made rich: so God oftentimes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to make the faithfull partake not onely in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, but in the poverty of Christ, that even by that meanes they may be rich in faith and dependance upon God, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> spake, <hi>Having nothing, and yet pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 2. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>All things.</hi> Secondly, All is ours in regard of<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 10.</note> Christian liberty, though our hands are bound from the possession, yet our Consciences are not bound from the use of any. Thirdly, Though the faithfull have not in the right of their inheritance any monopolie or ingrosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Creatures to themselves, yet still they have and shall have the service of them All. That is thus; If it were possible for any member of Christ to stand abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in neede of the use and service of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, All the Creatures in the world should undoubtedly waite upon him, and bee appropriated unto him. The Moone should stand still, the Sunne goe backe, the Lions should stop their mouths, the Fire should give over bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Ravens should bring him meate, the Heavens should raine downe bread, the Rockes should gush out with water, all the Creatures should muster up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to defend the Body of Christ. But though no such absolute necessity shall ever be, yet ordinarily we must learne to beleeve, That those things which God allowes us are best suteable to our particular estate, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us better then we doe our selves: that as lesse would haply make us repine, so more would make us full, and lift up our hearts against God, and set them on the world;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16278:26"/>
so that All is ours, not absolutely, but subordinately, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceably according to the exigence of our condition, to the proportion of our faith and furtherance of our Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The third particular inquire into was, <hi>How we doe by Prayer sanctifie the Creature to our selves?</hi> This is done in these three courses. 1. <hi>In procuring them.</hi> We ought not to set about any of our lawfull and just callings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a particular addressing our selves unto God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

Now then since all the world is thus bespread with ginnes, it mainely concernes us alwayes to pray, that we may use the world as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing it, that wee may enjoy the Creatures with such wisedome, temperance, sobriety, heavenly affections, as may make them so, many ascents to raise us neerer unto God, as so many glasses in which to contemplate the wisedome, providence, and care of God to men, as so many witnesses of his love, and of our duty. And thus doth prayer sanctifie the Creature in the use of it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, and in one word, Prayer sanctifies the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the <hi>review and recognition of them.</hi> and Gods mercy in them, with thanksgiving and thoughts of praise, as <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. 32. 9. 10. and <hi>David,</hi> 2. Sam. 7. 18. 21. looked upon God in the blessings with which hee had blessed them. And now since Prayer doth thus sanctifie the Creatures unto us, wee should make friends of the unrighteous Mammon, that wee may by that meanes get the prayers of the poore Saints upon us and our estate, that the eye which seeth us may blesse us, and the care that heareth us may give witnesse to us; that the loynes and the mouthes, the backes and the bellies of the poore and fatherlesse may be as so many reall suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations unto God for us.</p>
                  <p>The third and last direction which I shall give you to finde life in the Creature, shall bee to looke on it, and

Let him never so much smother and suppresse the truth, let him with all the Arte he can divert his conceits, and entangle his thoughts in secular cares, let him shut his eye-lids as close as his naile is to his flesh, yet the flashes of immortalitie are of so penetrative and searching a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they will undoubtedly get through all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles, which a minde not wholly over-dawb'd with worldlinesse and ignorance can put betweene.

                  <p>Now if we consider the various rootes of this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Creature, it will then further appeare unto us, that they are not onely mortall, but even momentarie and vanishing:</p>

For it was in the greater World, as in the administration of a private family; the poverty of the Master is felt in the bowels of all the rest, his staine and dishonour runnes into all the members of that society. As it is in the naturall body some parts may be distempered and ill affected alone, others not without contagion on the rest; a man may have a dimme eye, or a withered arme, or a lame foot, or an impedite tongue without any danger to the parts adjoyning; but a lethargie in the

head, or an obstruction in the liver, or a dyspepsie and indisposition in the stomake diffuseth universall maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through the body, because these are soveraigne and architectonicall parts of man: so likewise is it in the great and vast body of the Creation. However other Creatures might have kept their evill, if any had been in them, within their owne bounds, yet that evill which man, the Lord and head of the whole brought into the world, was a spreading and infectious evill, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey'd poyson into the whole frame of nature, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the seed of that universall dissolution which shall one day deface with darkenesse and horror the beauty of that glorious frame which wee now admire.

that universall flame which will melt the very Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 10.</note> of Nature into their primitive confusion. Thus wee see besides the created limitednesse of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which it was utterly unsuteable to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall desires of the soule of man, the sinne of man hath implanted in them a secret worme and rottennesse which doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> set forward their mortalitie, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them confusion, enmity, disproportion, sedition, inequalitie (all the seeds of corruption) hath made them,<note place="margin">Aristet.

Wee find likewise by plaine experience how languid the seeds
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16278:32"/>
of life, how faint the vigor either of heavenly influences, or of sublunary and inferiour agents are growne, when that life of men, which was wont to reach to almost a thousand yeeres, is esteemed even a miraculous age, if it be extended but to the tenth part of that duration. We<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 17. 18. Hos. 10. 8. Esay 34. 13.</note> need not examine the inferiour Creatures, which we find expressely cursed for the sinne of man with Thornes and Briers (the usuall expression of a curse in Scripture.) If we but open our eyes and looke about us, wee shall see what paines Husbandmen take to keepe the earth from giving up the Ghost, in opening the veines thereof, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their Soile and Marle as so many Pills or Salves, as so many Cordials and preservatives to keepe it alive, in laying it asleepe, as it were, when it lyeth fallow every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third yeere, that by any meanes they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in it that life, which they see plainely approching to its last gaspe.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see how besides the originall limitednesse of the Creature, there is in a second place a Moth or Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker by the infection of sinne begotten in them, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens their mortalitie, God ordering the second causes so amongst themselves, that they exercising enmitie one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, may punish the sinne of man in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, as the Lord stirred up the Babylonians against<note place="margin">Ier. 43. 8, 13.</note> the Egyptians to punish the sinnes of his owne people. And therefore wee finde, that the times of the Gospell, when holinesse was to bee more universall, are expressed by such figures, as restore perfection and peace to the<note place="margin">Esay 30. 23.</note> Creatures. <hi>The Earth shall be fat and plenteous, there shall be upon every high hill Rivers and Streames of water, the light of the Moone shall be as the light of the Sunne, and the light of the Sunne sevenfold, as the light of seven dayes.</hi>

thus much of the letter in them, to assure us that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever blemish since the Creation any of those glorious heavenly bodies are either in themselves, or by interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of foggy vapours subject unto, what ever enmities and destructive qualities enrage one beast against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are all of them the consequents of that finne which nothing can remove but the Gospell of Christ.

                  <p>But yet further in a third place there is a particular ground of this mortality to many men, namely <hi>the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular curse upon</hi> that place or creature which men enioy.

                  <p>Now to make some Application of this particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee leave it, This doth first discover and shame the folly of wicked worldlings both in their opinions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to earthly things. Love is blinde and will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make men beleeve that of any thing which they could wish to bee in it: and therefore, because wicked men wish with all their hearts, for the love they beare to the Creatures, that they might continue together for ever, the Divell doth at last so deeply delude them as to thinke that they shall continue for ever. Indeed in these and in the generall, they must needs confesse <hi>that one generation commeth and another goeth:</hi> but in their<note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 4.</note> owne particular they can never assume with any fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and experimentall assent the truth of that generall to their owne estates: And therefore what ever for shame of the world their outward professions may be, yet the Prophet <hi>David</hi> assures us, <hi>That their inward</hi>

But the psalmist concludes this to be but brutish and notorious folly, <hi>This their way is their folly, they like sheepe are laid downe in their graves, and death feeds upon them.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what a folly is it for men to build upon the sand, to erectan Imaginarie fabrick of I know not what Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, which hath not so much as a constant subsistence in the head that contrives it?

to build a house with much cost (and when he hath done, to inhabit it himself) of such rotten and inconsistent materials, as will undoubtedly within a yeere or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fall upon his head, and bury him in the ruines of his owne folly?

But our God who kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth times and seasons in his owne power, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every Creature under the Sunne limits which it shall not exceed, hath set bounds unto sinne likewise wherein to ripen.

                  <p>First in using the Creature, be sure thou keepe thine intellectuals untainted; for earthly things are apt to cast a filme over mens eyes, and to misguide them into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt apprehensions and presumptions of them.

A man can never be brought to God till he forsake the Creature, a man will never forsake the Creature till he see vanitie in the Creature. <hi>Turne away mine eyes from beholding vanitie.

And in the Apostles close the same reason is farther yet enforced: <hi>For the fashion of this world passeth away.</hi>

                  <p>1. <hi>It deceives or coozens,</hi> and therefore use it as if you used it not; use it as a man in a serious businesse would use a false friend that profers his assistance, though his protestations be never so faire, yet so employ him as that the businesse may be done though he should faile thee.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Transversum agit,</hi> It carries a man headlong, the lusts of the world are so strong and impetuous, that they are apt to enflame the desires, and even violently to carry away the heart of a man; and for this cause likewise use it as if you used it not, engage your selfe as little upon it as you can, doe as Mariners in a mighty winde, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>3. The fashion of this world passeth over, it doth but goe along by thee and salute thee, and therefore use it as if thou used'st it not; doe to it as thou would'st doe to a stranger whom thou meetest in the way, he goes one way and thou another; salute him, stay so long in his companie till from him thou have received better instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions touching the turnings and difficulties of thine owne way, but take heed thou turne not into the way of the Creature, least thou lose thine owne home.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Get an Eye of Faith, to looke Through and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16278:40"/>
Above the Creature. A man shall never get to looke of from the world, till he can looke beyond it. For the Soule will have hold-fast of something, and the reason why men cling so much to the earth is, because they have no assurance if they let goe that hold of having any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence else-where. Labour therefore to get an interest in Christ, to finde an everlasting footing in the stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Gods Promises in him, and that will make thee willing to suffer the losse of all things, it will implant a kinde of hatred and disestimation of all the most pretious endearements which thy soule did feede upon before. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith of wicked men, that they are <hi>Purblinde, they cannot see a farre off;</hi> they can see nothing but that<note place="margin">2.

There is in a dimme eye the same constant and habituall indisposition which sometimes happeneth unto a sound eye by reason of a thicke mist, though a man be wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in a very short lane, yet he sees no end of it; and so a naturall man cannot reach to the period of earthly<note place="margin">

The Apostle saith, That Faith is <hi>the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>

And therefore though there were many hundred yeeres to come in the Apostles time, and, for ought we know, may yet be to the dissolution of the world, yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tels us that even then it was the last houre, because faith being able distinctly to see the truth and promises of God, and the Endlesnesse of that life which is then presently to be revealed, the infinite excesse of vastnesse in that made that which was otherwise a great space seeme even as nothing, no more in comparison then the length of a Cane or Trunke, through which a man lookes on the heavens, or some vast countrey. And ever the greater magnitude and light there is in a body, the smaller will the <hi>medium</hi> or distance seeme from it; the reason why a perspective glasse drawes remote objects close to the eye, is because it multiplies the <hi>species.</hi> We then by faith apprehending an infinite and everlasting Glory, must needs conceive any thing through which we looke upon it to be but short &amp; vanishing. And therfore though the promises were a farre off in regard of their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 13.</note> yet the Patriarkes did not onely see, but embrace them; their faith seem'd to nullifie and swallow up all the distance. <hi>Abraham</hi> saw Christs day and was glad, he looked upon those many ages which were betweene<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.</note> him and his promised seed as upon small a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>First, They are <hi>Wounding Thornes;</hi> for that which is but a pricke in the flesh is a wound in the spirit: because the spirit is most tender of smart: and the wise man cals them <hi>Vexation of spirit.</hi> The Apostle tels us they beget many sorrowes, and those sorrowes bring death with<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 10.</note> them. If it were possible for a man to see in one view those oceans of bloud which have been let out of mens veines by this one Thorne; to heare in one noise all the groanes of those poore men, whose lives from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world unto these dayes of blood wherein we live have been set at sale, and sacrificed to the unsatiable ambition of their bloody rulers; to see and heare the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse remorse and bitter yellings of so many rich and mighty men as are now in hell, everlastingly cursing the deceite and murther of these earthly Creatures, it would easily make every man with pitty and amazement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that the Creatures of themselves without Christ to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16278:42"/>
qualifie their venome and to blunt their edge, are in good earnest <hi>Wounding Thornes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly they are <hi>Choaking Thornes;</hi> they stifle and keepe downe all the gratious seeds of the word yea the very naturall sproutings of noblenesse, ingenuity, morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the dispositions of men. Seed requires emptinesse in the ground that there may be a free admission of the raine and influences of the heavens to cherish it: And so the Gospell requires nakednesse and poverty of minde, a sense of our owne utter insufficiencie to our selves for happinesse, in which sense it is said that the <hi>poore receive the Gospel.</hi> But now earthly things meeting with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the heart are very apt, First, <hi>To Fill it,</hi> and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>To Swell it,</hi> both which are conditions contrary to the preparations of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>They <hi>Fill</hi> the Heart. First, with <hi>Businesse</hi> Yokes of ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 18, 20.</note> and farmes, and wives, and the like contentinents take up the studies and delights of men, that they cannot finde out any leisure to come to Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They Fill the Heart <hi>with Love, and the Love</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Iohn 2. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>of the world shuts out the Love of the father,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speakes. When the Heart goes after covetousnesse, the power and obedience of the word is shut quite out.<note place="margin">Ezeck. 33. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>They will not do thy words,</hi> saith the Lord to the Prophet, <hi>for their heart goeth after their covetousnesse.</hi> A deare and superlative Love, such as the Gospell ever requires (for a man must love Christ upon such termes as to bee ready without consultation or demurre, not to forsake onely, but to hate father and mother, and wife, and any the choisest worldly endearments for his Gospels sake) I say such a Love admits of no Corrivalty or competition. And therfore the love of the world must needs extingvish the love of the word.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, they fill the heart <hi>with feare</hi> of forgoing them; and feare takes of the heart from any thoughts save those which looke upon the matter of our feare:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16278:42"/>
when men who make Gold their Confidence heare that they must forsake all for Christ, and are sometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie put upon a triall, they start aside, choose rather secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enjoy what they have present hold of, then venture the interuption of their carnall contentments for such things, the beauty where of the Prince of this world hath blinded their eyes that they should not see. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till the minde be setled to beleeve that in God there is an ample recompence for any thing which wee may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise forgoe for him, it is impossible that a man should soundly embrace the love of the truth, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the love of the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as They Fill, so they <hi>Swell</hi> the Heart too, and by that meanes worke in it a contempt and disesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the simplicity of the Gospell. We have both together in the Prophet, According to their pasture so<note place="margin">Hos. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. Psal. 10 4.</note> were they <hi>Filled;</hi> they were filled, and their heart was <hi>Exalted,</hi> therefore have they forgotten me. Now the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate child of Pride is selfe-dependence and a reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on our owne sufficiencie, and from thence the next is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue is a contempt of the simplicity of that gospell which would drive us out of our selves. The Gentiles out of the pride of their owne wisedome counted the Gospell of<note place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 14.</note> they stifle the seeds of all noblenesse, ingenuity, or common vertues in the lives of men; from whence come oppression, extortion, bribery, cruelty, rapine, fraud, iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, treacherous, sordid, ignoble courses, a very dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lawes of nature amongst men, but from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of earthly things, from that Idol of covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which is set up in the heart?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are <hi>Deceitfull Thornes,</hi> as our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16278:43"/>
it. Let a man in a tempest go to a thorne for shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he shall light upon a thiefe in stead of a fence, which will teare his flesh in stead of succouring him, and doe him more injury then the evill which he fled from; and such are the Creatures of themselves, so farre are they from protecting, that indeed they tempt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray us. The pride of thine heart <hi>hath deceived thee,</hi> thou<note place="margin">Obad vers. 3. 4. Habak. 2. 9. 10. Ezek. 28. 17. Zeph. 2. 15.</note> that dwellest in the Clefts of the Rockes, thou that sayest in thine heart, Who shall bring me downe? I will bring thee downe, saith the Lord to Edom.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, they are <hi>vanishing Thornes.</hi> nothing so apt,<note place="margin">Psal. 58. 9. 118. 12.</note> nothing so easie to catch fire, and be presently extingvish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They are <hi>quenched like a fire of Thornes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To consider yet more distinctly the <hi>vexation</hi> of the Creature, we will observe first the <hi>Degrees;</hi> secondly, the <hi>Grounds</hi> of it; and thirdly, the <hi>Vses</hi> which we should put it to.</p>
                  <p>Five <hi>Degrees</hi> we shall observe of this <hi>Vexation.</hi> First, the Creatures are apt to molest the spirit <hi>in the procuring of them,</hi> even as Thornes will certainely pricke in their gathering. They make <hi>all a mans dayes sorrow, and his</hi>

                     <hi>travell griefe, they suffer not his heart to take rest in the night,</hi> as the Wise man speakes. What paines will men take? what hazards will they runne to procure their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires? Paines of body, plotting of braine, conflicts of passions, biting of conscience, disreputation amongst men, scourge of tongues, any thing, every thing will men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, to obtaine at last that which it may bee is not a competent reward for the smallest of these <hi>vexations.</hi> How will men exchange their salvation, throw away their owne mercy, make themselves perpetuall drudges and servitors to the times, fawne, flatter, comply, couple in with the instruments or authors of their hopes, hazard their owne blood in desperate undertakings, and staine their consciences with the blood of others, to swimme through all to their adored haven. <hi>Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And that the like vexation is ordinary in the procurement of any earthly things will easily appeare, if wee but compare the disposition of the minde with the obstacles that meete us in the pursuite of them. Suppose we a man importunately set to travell unto some place where the certainty of some great profit or preferment attends his comming, the way through which he must goe is intricate, deepe, unpassable, the beast that carries him lame and tired, his acquaintance none, his instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons few, what a heavie vexation must this needs bee to the soule of that man to be crossed with so many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in so eager a desire? Iust this is the case with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men in the prosecution of earthly things. First, the desires of men are very violent (which the Scripture useth to expresse by <hi>making haste, greedy coveting, a purpose to</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 21. 5. 26. 1. Tim. 6. 9.</note>

The Apostle describes them by <hi>gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that very importunity of desires is full of <hi>vexation</hi> in itselfe. But besides, the meanes for fulfilling these desires are very difficult, the instruments very weake and impotent: peradventure a mans wits are not sutea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

A man deales with the earth, he findes it weake and langvid, every foot of that must often times lye <hi>fallow,</hi> when his desires doe still plow; with men, hee findes their hearts hard, and their hands close; with servants, he findes them slow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull; with trading hee findes the times hard, the World at a stand, every man too thrifty to deale much, and too crafty to be deceived; so that now that <hi>vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which was at first begun with <hi>vehemency of desire,</hi> is mightily improued with <hi>impatiency of opposition,</hi> &amp; lastly much encreased with the <hi>feare of utter disappointment</hi> at last. For according as the desires are either more urgent, or more difficult, so will the feares of their miscarriage grow; and it is a miserable thing for the minde to bee torne asunder betweene two such violent passions as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and Feare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>second Degree of vexation</hi> is in the multiplying of the Creature, that men may have it to looke upon with their eyes, and to worship it in their affections. And in this Case the more the heape growes, the more the heart is enlarged unto it; and impossible it is that that desire should be ever quieted, which growes by the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing desired. A Wolfe that hath once tasted blood is more fierce in the desire of it then hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, experience puts an edge upon the Appetite; and so it is in the desires of men, they grow more savage and raging in the second or third prosecution then in the first. It is a usuall selfe-deceit of the heart to say and thinke, If I had such an accession to mine estate, such
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16278:44"/>
a dignitie mingled with mine other preferments, could but leave such and such portions behind me, I should then rest satisfied and desire no more. This is a most notorious cheate of the fleshly heart of man; first thereby to beget a secret conceit, that since this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gotten I should sit quietly downe, I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set my selfe with might and maine to procure it, and in the meane time neglect the state of my soule, and peradventure shipwracke my conscience upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct and unwarrantable meanes for fulfilling so war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and just a desire.

For it is with worldly love as with the Sea, let it have at the first never so little a gap at which to creepe in, and it will eate out a wider way, till at last it grow too strong for all the bulwarkes and overrun the soule. <hi>Omne peccatum habet in se mendacium:</hi> there<note place="margin">Aug. de Civ.

it sinkes to the Center of the heart: As in Nature, the Heavens we know are alwayes calme, serene, uniforme, undisturbed; they are the clouds and lower regions that thunder and bluster; The Sunne and Starres rayse up no Fogges so high, as that they may imprint any reall blot upon the beauty of those purer bodies, or disquiet their constant and regular motions; but in the lower regions, by reason of their nearenesse to the earth, they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raise up such Meteors as often breake forth into thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and tempests; so the more heavenly the minde is, the more untainted doth it keepe it selfe from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and temptations of worldly things, the more quiet and composed is it in all estates; but in mindes meerely sensuall the hotter Gods favours shine, and the faster his raine falles upon them, the more Fogges are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the higher Thornes grow up, the more darkenesse, and distractions do shake the soule of such a man.

                  <p>Give me leave to explane this Vexation in some one or two of <hi>Salomons</hi> particulars, and to unfold his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements thereof out of them. And first to begin with that with which he begins. The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of things, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>naturall</hi> in this present text, or <hi>morall</hi> and <hi>civill. vers.</hi> 17. of both which he concludeth that they are <hi>Uanitie and vexation of spirit.</hi> The first argument he takes from the <hi>weakenesse</hi> of it either to restore or correct any thing that is amisse. <hi>That which is crooked cannot be made strait.</hi> Wee may understand it severall waies. First, All our knowledge by reason of mans corruption is but a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ragged, impedite knowledge, and for that reason a vexation to the minde: for rectitude is full of beauty, and crookednesse of deformity. In mans Creation his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16278:46"/>
should have walked in the strait path of truth, should have had a distinct view of causes and effects in their immediate successions; but now sinne hath ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led such confusion with things, that the minde is faine to take many crooked and vast compasses for a little uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge. Secondly, The weakenesse of all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge is seene in this that it cannot any way ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevent or correct the naturall crookednesse of the smallest things, much lesse make a man solidly and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially happy. Thirdly, That which is crooked can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made straite. It is impossible for a man by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actest knowledge of naturall things to make the nature of a man, which by sinne is departed from its primitive rectitude, strait againe, to repaire that Image of God which is so much distorted. <hi>When they knew God, they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified</hi>

                     <hi>him not as God, they became vaine in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and their foolish heart was darkned. It</hi> is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles speech of the wisest heathen. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall<note place="margin">Ethic. lib. 7. c. 3. &amp; 4.

Seneca likewise the exactest Stoick which wee meet with, then whom never any man writ more divinely for the contempt of the world, was yet the richest usurer that ever wee read of in ancient stories, though that were a sinne discovered and condemned by the heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>A second Ground of vexation from knowledge is <hi>The Defects and Imperfections of it. That which is wanting cannot be numbred.</hi> There are many thousand conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in nature which the most inquisitiue Iudgement is not able to pierce into, nor resolve into their just princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Nay still the more a man knowes, the more disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries he makes of things which he knowes not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in <hi>much wisdome is much griefe, and he that</hi>

His Eminence lodes him with envy, jealousies, observation, suspicions, forceth him often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon unwelcom compliancies, upon colours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions to palliate unjust counsels, and stop the clamors of a gainsaying Conscience, fills him with feares of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage and disgrace, with projects of honour and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility, with restlesse thoughts touching discoveries, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, concealements, accommodations, and the like, in one word is very apt to make him a stranger to God and his owne soule. In other learning, let a man but consider, First, The confusion, uncertainty, involvednesse, perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xities of causes and effects by mans sinne; Secondly, The paines of the body, the travell of the minde, the sweate of the braine, the tugging and plucking of the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the very drudgery of the soule to breake through that confusion, and her owne difficulties; Thirdly, the many invincible doubts and errors which wil stil blemish our brightest notions; Fourthly, the great charges which the very instruments and furniture of learning wil put men to; Fifthly, the general disrespect which, when all is done, it findes in the world, great men scorning it as pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ordinary men unable to take notice of it, and great schollers faine to make up a theater amongst themselves; Sixthly, the Insufficiency thereof to perfect that which is amisse in our nature, the malignant property thereof to put sinne into armour, to contemne the simplicity and purity of Gods Word; And lastly, the neere approach thereof to its owne period, the same death that attendeth us being ready also to bury all our learning in the grave with us: these and infinite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the like considerations must needs mingle much sorrow with the choisest Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let us take a view of <hi>pleasure.</hi> There is nothing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16278:47"/>
doth so much disable in the survey of pleasure as the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either of folly or want. When a man hath wisdome to apprehend the exquisitnes of his delights, and variety to keepe out the su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his wisedome was furnish'd with variety of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to enquire into, he had magnificence and provisions suteable to the greatnesse of his royall minde. Sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and delicate diet under the name of wine. vers. 3. stately Edifices. vers. 4. Vineyards and Orchards, yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Paradises, as large as Woods. vers. 5. 6. Fish-ponds, and<note place="margin">1.

Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, As he had that most abundant, so likewise the most free, undisturbed, unabated enjoyment of them all, Hee with-held not his heart from any joy; there was no mixture of sicknesse, warre, or any intercurrent difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to corrupt their sweetnesse, or blunt the tast of them. Here are as great preparations as the heart of man can expect to make an universall survay of those delights which are in the Creature: and yet at last upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall enquirie into all his most magnificent workes, the conclusion is, they were but <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit,</hi> vers. 11. Which vexation he further explanes. First, by the necessarie divorce which was to come betweene him and them, Hee was to leave them all. vers. 18. Secondly, by his disability so to dispose of them as that after him they might remaine in that manner as hee had ordered them. vers. 19. Thirdly, by the effects which these and the like considerations wrought in him; they were so farre
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16278:48"/>
from giving him reall satisfaction, as that First, he <hi>Hated</hi> all his workes, for there is nothing makes one Hate more eagerly then disappointment in the good which a man expected. When <hi>Ammon</hi> found what little satisfaction<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13. 15.</note> his exorbitant lust received in ravishing his Sister <hi>Tamar,</hi> he as fiercely hated her after as he had desir'd her before. Secondly, He <hi>Despaired</hi> of finding any good in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they be get nothing but travell, drudgery, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Lastly let us take a view of <hi>Riches,</hi> the ordinarily most adored Idol of all the rest. The wise man saies first in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, <hi>neither Riches nor yet abundance of Riches will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the soule of man.</hi> Eccl. 5. 10. This he more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explanes. First, from the sharers which the encrease of them doth naturally draw after it. vers. 11. and betweene the Owners and the sharers there is no difference but this, an emptie speculation, one sees as his owne, what the other enjoyes to those reall purposes for which they serve as well as he. Secondly, from the unquietnes which naturally growes by the encrease of them, which makes an ordinarie drudge in that respect more happy. vers. 12. Thirdly, from the hurt which usually, without some due corrective they bring. vers. 13. either they hurt a man in himselfe, being strong temptations and materials too of pride, vaine-glory, couetousnesse, luxurie, intemperance, forgetfulnesse of God, love of the world, and by these of disorder, dissolutenesse, and diseases in the body; or else at least they expose him to the envie, accusations, violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of wicked men. Fourthly from their uncertainty of abode, they perish by an evill travell, either Gods curse,<note place="margin">See Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Fifthly from the certainty of an everlasting separation from them. vers. 15. 16. and this he saith is a <hi>sore evill,</hi> which galles the heart of a worldly man, that hath resolved upon no other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then his wealth, when sicknes comes to snatch him

                        </gap>ury</hi> in him. vers. 17. Sixthly, from the disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to use or enjoy them, when a man through inordinate love, or distrustfull providence, or sordidnesse of spirit, or encumbrances of employments, will not while he lives enjoy his abundance, and when he dies hath not, either by his owne covetous prevention, or his successors inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, an honorable buriall. Chap. 6. vers. 1. 2. 3. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, from the narrownesse of any satisfaction which can be received from them, vers. 7. All the wealth a man hath can reach no higher then the <hi>filling of his mouth,</hi> then the outward services of the body, the desires of the soule remaine empty still. A glutton may fill his belly, but he cannot fill his lust; a covetous man may have a hovse full of monie, but hee can never have a heart full of mony; an ambitious man may have titles enough to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharge his memorie, but never to fill his pride; the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations of the soule would not cease, the curiosity of the understanding would not stand at a stay, though a man could hold all the learning of the great library in his head at once; the sensualitie of a lascivious man would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be satiated, it would be the more enrag'd, though hee should ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When men have done all they can with their wisedome and wealth they can fill no more but the mouth, and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and folly makes a shift to doe soe too. vers. 8. the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires wander, the soule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Eighthly, from their disability to protect or rescue a man from evill, to advance the strength of a man beyond what it was before. vers. 10. Though a man could scrape all the wealth in the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

his wealth shall be never able to blinde the eye, or bribe the Iustice, or testraine the power of Almighty God, if hee bee pleased to inflict the strokes of his vengeance vpon his Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The fourth degree of vexation is from the <hi>Review of them.</hi> First, if a man consider the <hi>meanes</hi> of his getting them.

pretious, spirituall and everlasting consequence, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these golden opportunities hath thy too much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd love and attendance on the world stolne from thee? and surely to a soule illightned these must needs be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of much vexation. Thirdly, if a man consider <hi>the use he</hi> hath made of them: How they have stolne away his heart from trusting in God to rely on them; how they have diverted his thoughts from the life to come, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched him to dote on present contentmens; to love life, to feare death, to dispence with much unjust liberty, to gather rust and securitie in Gods worship? How much excesse and intemperance they have provoked, how little of them have been spent on Gods glory and Church, how small a portion we have repaid him in his Ministers or in his Members? how few naked backes they have clothed? how few empty bellies they have filled? how few langvishing bowels they have refreshed? how few good workes and services they have rewarded? These are considerations which unto sensible consciences must sometime or other beget much vexation. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if a man consider his owne former <hi>experiences,</hi> or the <hi>examples</hi> of others that bring the vanitie of these earthly things into minde. How some of his choysest pleasures have now out-liv'd him and are expir'd; how the Lord hath snatched from his dearest embracements those Idols which were set up against his glory; how many of his hopes have fail'd, of his expectations and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proved abortive; how much mony at one time a Sicknesse, at another a Suite, at a third a Thiefe, at a fourth a shipwrack or miscariage, at a fifth, yea at a twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth time a lust hath consum'd and eaten out; How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples there are in the world of withered and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted estates, of the Curse of God not onely like a moth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly consuming, but like a Lyon suddenly tearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder great possessions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>last Degree of Uexation</hi> from the Creature is from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16278:50"/>
the <hi>Disposing</hi> of them. All Creatures, sinners especially, that have no hope or portion in another life, doe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally love <hi>a present earthly Immortality:</hi> and therefore though they cannot have it in themselves, yet as the Philosopher saith of living Creatures, the reason why they generate is, that that Immortality which in their owne particulars they cannot have, they may <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> so farre as they are able procure in the <hi>species</hi> or kinde which they thus preserve; so rich and worldly men, though they cannot be immortall on the earth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet they affect an immortality in their names and dwelling places, Psal. 49. 11. and therefore they desire to transmit their substance unto such successors as may haue wisedome and noblenesse of minde to continue it. Now then if a man either have no heire, or one that is so active as to alter, or so carelesse and supine as to ruine all, either base to dishonor the house, or profuse to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, these and many other the like doubts must needs infinitely perplex the mindes of men, greedy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate their names and places, Eccles. 2. 18. 19.</p>
                  <p>The second thing which we proposed to consider in this argument was the Grounds of this Vexation. I shall name but Three. <hi>Gods Curse; Mans Corruption;</hi> and the <hi>Creatures Deceitfulnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have at large before insisted on the Curse considered alone, now I am to shew in one word <hi>the issuing of Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation therefrom.</hi> The curse of the Creature is as it were the poison and contagion of it; and let a man mixe poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the most delicate wine, it will but so much the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier, by the nimblenesse of the spirits there, invade the parts of the body, and torment the bowels. Gold of it selfe is a pretious thing, but to be shackled with fetters of gold, to have it turn'd into a use of bondage, addes moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery to the affliction; and farre more pretious to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man is a chaine of iron which drawes him out of a pit, then a chaine of gold which clogs him in a prison;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16278:50"/>
a key of iron which lets him out of a dungeon, then a barre of gold that shuts him in. If a man should have a great Diamond curiously cut into sharpe angles, worth many thousand pounds, in his bladder, no man would count him a rich, but a miserable and a dead man; this is just the case betweene a man and the Creatures of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves without Christ to sanctifie them unto us; though the things be excellent in their owne being, yet mingled with our corruptions and lusts, they are turned into poison, into the Gall of Aspes within a man, they will not suffer him to feele any quietnesse in his belly, <hi>in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 20. 14. 16. 20. 22. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>of his sufficiencie he shall be in straights, and while hee is eating, the furie of wrath shall raine downe upon him.</hi> Let a mans meate be never so sweet in it selfe, yet if hee should temper the sawce with dirt out of a sinke, it would make it altogether loathsome; and a wicked man eates all his meate like swine wrapp'd up and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawb'd with dirt and curses. <hi>A little,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, which the righteous hath is better then great riches of the ungodly: In se</hi> it is not, but <hi>Quoad hominem,</hi> in regard of the man it is: for that little which a righteous man hath is to him an experience of Gods Promise, a branch of his love, a meanes of thankefull affections in him, a <hi>viaticum</hi> unto heaven; whereas the wicked mans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance turnes into his greater curse, their table becomes their snare, and those things which should have been for<note place="margin">Psal. 69. 22.</note> their good prove unto them an occasion of falling. God makes his Sunne to shine on the Iust and on the unjust, on a garden of spices and on a dunghill: but in the one it begetteth a sweete favour of praise and obedience, in the other it raiseth up noisome lusts, which prove a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto death. And who had not rather be free in a cottage, then condemn'd in a palace? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth of <hi>a Reward</hi> and <hi>a Dispensation. If I preach</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>the Gospell willingly I have a Reward, if against my will a Dispensation is committed unto me.</hi> We may apply it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16278:51"/>
to our purpose. Those good things which the faithfull enjoy though but small are yet Rewards and Accessions unto the Kingdome of God and his righteousnesse, and so long they bring joy and peace with them; but unto the wicked they are meerely a Dispensation, they have onely the burden and businesse, not the Reward nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of the Creature.</p>
                  <p>The second Ground is the <hi>Corruption of nature,</hi> which maketh bitter and uncleane every thing that toucheth it.<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15. Hag. 2. 12, 13, 14 Revel. 10. 9.</note> It polluteth holy flesh, much more will it pollute ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things. We reade of a Roule which was sweete in the mouth, but bitternesse in the belly: Such are the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; In the bowels of men, their hearts and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (which are the Seminaries of Corruption) they turne into gall, however in the mouth they have some smatch of honie in them. For this is <hi>a Constant Rule, Then only doth the Creature satisfie a man when it is suteable to his occasions and necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ies.</hi> The reason why the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is unsufficient for a prince, which is abundant for a private man, is because the occasions of the prince are more vast, massie, and numerous then the occasions of a private man. Now the desires and occasions of a man in Christ, that doth not ransacke the Creature for Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, are limited and shortned, whereas another mans are still at large: for he is in a way, his eye is upon an end, he useth the world but as an Inne, and no man that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels home-ward will multiply businesses unnecessarily upon himselfe in the way. In his house he can finde sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry employments to busie himselfe about, the education of his children, the governement of his family, the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his estate are able to fill up all his thoughts, whereas in the Inne he cares for nothing but his refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and rest: So here, The faithfull make their home their businesse, how to have their conversation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, how to have a free and comfortable use of the foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16278:51"/>
their evill hearts, how to please God their father and Christ their husband, how to secure their interest in their expected inheritance, how to thrive in grace, to bee rich in good workes, to purchase to themselves a further degree of glory, how to entaile their spirituall riches to their posterity in a pious education of their children, these are their employments: the things of this life are not matters of their <hi>Home,</hi> but onely comfortable refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the <hi>way,</hi> which therefore they use not as their<note place="margin">Solatia non negotia.</note> grand occasions to create businesses to them, but only as interims and necessary respites. So that hereby their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions being few and narrow, those things which they here enjoy are unto those occasions largely suteable, and by consequent very satisfactory unto their desires. But worldly men are here at Home, they have their portion in this life: hereupon their desires are vast, and their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions springing out of those desires, infinite. A man in the right way findes at last an end to his journey, but hee that is out of the way wanders infinitely without any successe. Rest is that which the desires and wings of the soule doe still carry men upon. Now the faithfull being alwayes in the way, doe with comfort goe on, though it be peradventure deepe and heavie, because they are sure it will bring them home at last; but wicked men in a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer way are never satisfied, because they have not before<note place="margin">

                  <p>The third and last ground is the <hi>Creatures deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> there is no one thing will more disquiet the minde then to be defeated.

                     </gap>ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the fruition of earthly things, like the foole in the Parable, and to be herein disappointed is the ground of much vexation. When a man travels in deepe way &amp; sees before him a large smoothe plaine, he presumes that will recompence the wile he was formerly put to; but when he comes to it, and findes it as rotten, as full of sloughs, and bogs and quagmires as his former way, his trouble is the more multiplied, because his hopes are deceiv'd: The divell and the world beget in mens mindes large hopes, and make profuse promises to those that will worship them; and a man at a distance sees abundance of pleasure and happinesse in riches, honors, high place, eminent employments, and the like; but when he hath his hearts desire, and peradventure hath out-climb'd the very modesty of his former wishes, hath ventur'd to breake through many a hedge, to make gaps through Gods Law and his owne conscience, that he might by shorter passages hasten to the idoll he so much worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, he findes at last that there was more trouble in the fruition, then expectation at the distance; that all this is but like the <hi>Egyptian Temples,</hi> where through a stately<note place="margin">Clem. Alex. in Paedag. li. 3. ca. 2.</note> frontispice and magnificent structure a man came with much preparations of reverence and worship but to the Image of an vgly ape, the ridiculous idoll of that people. A man comes to the world as to a lottry with a head full of hopes and projects to get a prize, and returnes with a heart full of blankes, utterly deluded in his expectation. The world useth a man as Ivie doth an Oke, the closer it gets to the heart, the more it clings and twists about the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16278:53"/>
affections (though it seeme to promise and flatter much) yet it doth indeed but eate out his reall substance and choake him in the embraces.</p>
                  <p>First then they <hi>deceive our judgements,</hi> make us thinke better of them then they deserue; they deale with us as the Philistines with <hi>Sampson,</hi> they begin at our eyes. Thus the divell began to beguile <hi>Eve, When she saw</hi> that the<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6. 1.

                  <p>Secondly, they <hi>deceive our hopes and expectations. Achan</hi> promised himselfe much happinesse in a wedge of gold and Babylonish garment; but they were deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cursed things, they did not only deceive him, but undoe him; The wedge of gold (if I may so speake) did serue to no other purpose but to cleave asunder his soule from his body, and the Babylonish garment but for a shrowd. <hi>Gehazies</hi> presumptions were vast, and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he thought very easie to buy garments, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheepe and oxen, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants and maide-servants at the price of an officious and mercenarie lye, he thought he had provided well for his posterity by the reward of <hi>Naaman;</hi> but the event proves quite contrarie, he provided nothing but a leprosie for himselfe and his seede forever.</p>
                  <p>They deceive our hopes in <hi>respect of Good;</hi> They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise <hi>long life,</hi> and yet the same night a mans soule is taken<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 20. Ezek. 28. 9.</note> from him, and they the instruments of that calamity: How many men have perished by their honours? how many have beene eaten up by their pleasures? how many hath the greedy desire of wealth powred out into the grave? They promise <hi>peace</hi> and safety (as we see<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 36.</note> how Israel boasted in their mountaines, confederacies,

                  <p>Lastly, They Deceive us likewise in <hi>respect of evill.</hi> No Creatures, however they may promise Immunitie and deliverance, can doe a man any good when the Lord will be pleased to send evill upon him. And yet it is not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that a truth so universally confessed should yet bee repeated in the Scripture, <hi>That silver, and gold, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible</hi>

                     <hi>things are</hi> not a fit <hi>price</hi> for the soules of men.

                  <p>Before wee proceed to the last thing proposed; here is a question to be answered. If the Creatures be so full of Vexation, It should seeme that it is unprofitable and by consequence unlawfull either to labour or to pray for them. Which yet is plainely contrary to Christs dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Give us our daylie bread, and contrary to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Saints who use to call for the fatnesse of the earth and dew of heaven, peace of walls and prosperity of Palaces upon those whom they blesse.</p>
                  <p>To which I answere. That which is evill by accident doth not prejudice that which is Good in it selfe and by Gods ordination. Now the vexation which hath been spoken of is not an effect flowing naturally out of the condition of the creature, but ariseth meerely <hi>by accident,</hi> upon the reason of its separation from God, who at first did appoint his owne blessed communion to goe along with his Creatures. Now things which are good in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16278:54"/>
themselves, but accidentally evill may justly be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our prayers and endeavours: And so on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, many things there are which in themselves alone are evill, yet by the providence and disposition of God they have a good issue, they worke together for the best to them that love God. It was good for <hi>David</hi> that he had been afflicted: yet wee may not lawfully pray for such evils on our selves or others, upon presumption of Gods goodnesse to turne them to the best. Who doubts that the calamities of the Church doe at this time stirre up the hearts of men to seeke the Lord and his face, and to walke humbly and fearefully before him; yet that man should be a curse and prodigie in the eyes of God and men, who should still pray for the calamities of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to see the stones of Ierusalem still in the dust. Death is in it selfe an evill thing (for the Apostle calles it <hi>an enemy,</hi> 1. Cor. 15.) yet by the infinite power and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, who delights to bring good out of evill, and beauty out of ashes, it hath not onely the sting taken away, but is made an entrance into Gods owne presence, with reference unto which benefit, the Apostle desireth <hi>to be dissolved and to be with Christ,</hi> Phil. 1. 23. Now notwithstanding this goodnesse which death by accident brings along with it, yet being in it selfe a <hi>Destructive thing,</hi> we may lawfully in the desires of our soule shrinke from it and decline it. Example whereof we have in the death of Christ himselfe, which was of all as the most bitter, so the most pretious: and yet by reason of that bitternesse which was in it, hee prayes against it, presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto his Father the desires of his Soule for that life which he came to lay downe: as his obedience to his Father, and love to his Church made him most willingly embrace death, so his love to the integritie of his humane nature, and feare of so heavy pressures as he was to feele, made him as seriously to decline it. And though the Apostle did most earnestly desire to be with Christ, yet
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16278:55"/>
he did in the same desire decline the common rode thither through the darke passages of death, 2. Cor. 5. 4. Vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full indeed it is for any man to pray universally against death, because that were to withstand the Statutes of God, Heb 9. 27. but against any particular danger wee may; as <hi>Ezechiah</hi> did, 1. King. 20. 1, 2. reserving still a generall submission to the will and decrees of God. For we are bound in such a case to use all good meanes, and to pray for Gods blessing upon them, which amounts to a prayer against the danger it selfe. So then, by the Rule of contraries, though the Creatures be full of vanitie and vexation, yet this must not swallow up the apprehension of that goodnesse which God hath put into them, nor put off the desires of men from seeking them of God in those just prayers which he hath prescribed, and in those lawfull endeavours which he hath commanded and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
                  <p>The third thing proposed was the consideration of that <hi>Vse</hi> which we should make of this vexation of the Creature. And first the consideration thereof mingled with faith in the heart must needes worke humiliation in the spirit of a man, upon the sight of those sinnes which have so much defaced the good Creatures of God. Sinne was the first thing that did pester the earth with thornes, Gen. 3. 17. 18. and hath fill'd all the Creation with vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and bondage. Sinne is the ulcer of the soule; touch a wound with the softest Lawne, and there will smart arise; so though the Creatures be never so harmelesse, yet as soone as they come to the heart of a man, there is so much sinne and corruption there, as must needs beget paine to the soule. The palate, prepossest with a bitter humour, findes it owne distemper in the sweetest meate it tastes; so the soule, having the ground of bitternesse in it selfe, finds the same affection in every thing that comes neere it. Death it self, though it be none of Gods works, but the shame and deformitie of the Creature, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16278:55"/>
sinne it hath no sting in it, 1. Cor. 15. 55. how much lesse sting, thinke we, have those things which were made for the comforts of mans life, if sinne were not the Serpent that did lurke under them all? Doest thou then in thy swiftest careere of earthly delights, when thou art posting in the wayes of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes, feele a curbe privily galling thy conscience, a secret dampe seizing upon thy soule, and affrighting it with dismall suspicions and trembling pre-occupations of attending judgements, see a hand against the wall writing bitter things against thee? Dost thou in all thy lawfull Callings finde much sweat of brow, much toyle of braine, much plunging of thoughts, much care of heart in compassing thy just and lawfull intendments? Doe not lose the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of that good which all this may suggest unto thee, take advantage to fish in this troubled water. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely there is some <hi>Ionah</hi> that hath raysed this storme, there is some sinne or other that hath caused all this trouble to thy soule. Doe not repine at Gods providence, nor quarrell with the dumbe Creatures, but let thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation reflect upon thine owne heart; and as ever thou hopest to have the sweat of thy brow abated, or the care of thy heart remitted, or the curse of the Creature removed, cast thy selfe downe before God, throw out thy sinne, awake thy Saviour with the cry of thy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and all the stormes will be suddenly calmed. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely the more power any man hath over the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his nature, the lesse power hath the sting of any Creature over his heart. Though thou hast but a dinner of herbes with a quiet conscience, reconciled unto God, thou dost therein finde more sweetnesse then in a fatted Oxe with the contentions of a troubled heart. When ever therefore we finde this Thorne in the Creature, wee should throw our selves downe before God, and in some such manner as this bewaile the sinne of our heart, which is the roote of that Thorne. Lord, thou art a God
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16278:56"/>
of peace and beauty, and what ever comes from thee must needs originally have peace and beauty in it. The Earth was a Paradise when thou didst first bestow it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, but my sinne hath turned it into a Desert, and curs'd all the increase thereof with Thornes. The honour which thou gavest me was a glorious attribute, a sparkle of thine owne fire, a beame of thine owne light, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse of thine owne Image, a character of thine owne power; but my sinne hath put a Thorne into mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, my greedinesse when I look upward to get higher, and my giddinesse when I looke downeward for feare of falling, never leaves my heart without angvish and vexation. The pleasure which thou allowest mee to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy is full of sweet refreshment, but my sinne hath put a Thorne into this likewise; my excesse and sensualitie hath so choaked thy Word, so stifled all seeds of noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in my minde, so like a Canker overgrowne all my pretious time, stolne away all opportunities of grace, melted and wasted all my strength, that now my refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are become my diseases. The Riches which thou gavest me, as they come from thee, are soveraigne bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, wherewith I might abundantly have glorified thy Name, and served thy Church, and supplyed thy Saints, and made the eyes that saw mee to blesse mee, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ares that heard me, to beare witnesse to me, wherewith I might have covered the naked backe, and cured the bleeding wounds, and filled the hungry bowels, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the fainting desires of mine owne Saviour in his distressed members; but my sinne hath put in so many Thornes of pride, hardnesse of heart, uncompassionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, endlesse cares, securitie and resolutions of sinne, and the like, as are ready to pierce me thorow with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sorrowes. The Calling wherein thou hast placed me is honest and profitable to men, wherein I might spend my time in glorifying thy Name, in obedience to thy will, in attendance on thy blessings; but my sinne hath
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16278:56"/>
brought so much ignorance and inapprehension upon my understanding, so much weakenesse upon my body, so much intricatenesse upon my employments, so much rust and sluggishnes upon my faculties, so much earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindednesse upon my heart, as that I am not able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much discomfort to goe on in my Calling. All thy Creatures are of thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>lves full of honour and beauty, the beames and gli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>pses of thine owne glory; but our sinne hath stained the beauty of thine owne handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, so that now thy wrath is as well revealed from Heaven as thy glory, we now see in them the prints as well of thy terrours as of thy goodnesse. And now, Lord, I doe in humblenesse of heart truly abhorre my selfe, and abominate those cursed sinnes, which have not onely defiled mine owne nature and person, but have spread deformitie and confusion upon all those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in which thine owne wisedome and power had planted so great a beauty, and so sweet an order. After some such manner as this ought the consideration of the thornynesse of the Creature humble us in the sight of those sinnes which are the rootes thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the consideration hereof should make us wise to prevent those cares which the Creatures are so apt to beget in the heart: those I meane which are bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Vexation of the Creature. There is a two fold <hi>Care, Regular and Irregular.</hi> Care is then Regular, First, when it hath a <hi>Right end,</hi> such as is both suteable with and subordinate to our maine end, the Kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse. Secondly, when the <hi>meanes</hi> of procuring that end are <hi>right;</hi> for we may not do evill to effect Good. Recovery was a lawfull end which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haziah</hi> did propose, but to enquire of <hi>Baalzebub</hi> was a meanes which did poyson the whole businesse: nay Saint <hi>Austin</hi> is resolute, that if it were possible by an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious<note place="margin">Aug. de Mendac. ad Consent. lib.</note> lie to compasse the redemption of the whole world, yet so weighty and universall a good must rather
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16278:57"/>
bee let fall, then brought about by the smallest evill. Thirdly, when the <hi>manner of it is good,</hi> and that is, first, when the Care is <hi>moderate,</hi> Phil. 4. 5, 6. Secondly, when it is with <hi>submission to the will and wisedome of God,</hi> when wee can with comfort of heart, and with much confidence of a happy issue recommend every thing that concernes us to his providence and disposall, can bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have our humours mastered, and conceits capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated to his obedience, when we can with <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve not to torment our hearts with needlesse &amp; endlesse projects, but to rowle our selves upon Gods protection. <hi>If I shall finde favour in his eyes, he will bring me againe,</hi>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16278:57"/>
finde nothing but trouble and vexation; but even to those lower ends which the Creatures are proper and suteable unto. For <hi>unto us</hi> properly belongs the <hi>Industry,</hi> but <hi>unto God the care,</hi> unto us the labour and use of meanes, but unto God the blessing and successe of all.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 6.</note> Though <hi>Paul</hi> plant and <hi>Apollo</hi> waters, it is God onely that can give the increase, he must be trusted with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of all our industry. <hi>Peter</hi> never began to sinke till<note place="margin">Matth. 14. 28.</note> he began to doubt, that was the fruit of his carking and unbeliefe. Which of you by taking thought can adde one<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 25.</note> cubit to his stature, saith Christ, our cares can never bring to passe our smallest desires; because I say the care of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents was ever Gods prerogative and belonged wholly to his providence. Vpon him wee must cast our care, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 7.</note> him we must vnlode our burdens, and he will sustaine<note place="margin">Psal. 55. 22.</note> us. Wee are all of <hi>one family,</hi> of the houshold of God<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 19.

If we should see a childe carke and toyle for his living, wee should presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he was left to the wide world, and had no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to provide for him; and that is our Saviours argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>take no thought, for your heavenly Father knoweth</hi>

                     <hi>you have need of these things.</hi> Let us therefore learne to cast our selves upon God. First, <hi>Infaith</hi> depending vpon the <hi>truth of his promises, He hath said I will not faile thee nor forsake thee,</hi> and upon the <hi>All-sufficiency of his Power,</hi>

Esay 49. 24 25.</note> see no way to turne, there we give over trusting God, as if our sinnes were greater then could be forgiven, or our afflictions then could be removed. It is therefore a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes of establishing the heart in all estates, to have<note place="margin">Hab. 3. 3. 18. Zach. 4. 6. 10. Esay 55. 8. 12. Hos. 11. 9. 2 Chro. 20. 6. 12</note> the eye of Faith fixed upon the power God, to consider that his thoughts and contrivances are as much above ours, as Heaven is above the Earth; and therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve with <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> that when wee know not what to doe, yet we will have our eyes upon him still. Sonne of Man, saith the Lord to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> can these dead bones<note place="margin">Ezek. 37. 3.</note> live; and hee answered, <hi>O Lord God thou knowest.</hi> Thy thoughts are aboue our thoughts; and where things are to us impossible, they are easie unto thee. Secondly, by<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 16. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Prayer.</hi> This is a maine remedy against carefull thoughts. When the Apostle had exhorted the Philippians, that their Moderation, that is, their Equanimitie and calme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of minde in regard of outward things, should bee knowne unto all men, he presseth it with this excellent reason, <hi>The Lord is at hand,</hi> he is ever at home in his<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 5. 6. 7.</note> owne family, he is <hi>neere</hi> to see the wants, and to heare the cries of all that come unto him; therefore saith hee, <hi>Bee carefull for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication with thankesgiving</hi> (thankesgiving for what you have, and prayer for what you want) <hi>let your requests be made knowne unto God,</hi> and hee shall furnish you with peace in all estates.

bitternesse of her soule she wept, and did not eate (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">1. Chron. 29. 9. Deut. 12. 18. Deut. 28. 47. Mal. 2. 13.</note> of the Sacrifices, which were to be eaten with rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing) then she prayed, and vowed a vow unto the Lord, and having cast her cares upon him, she then went her way, and did eate, and her countenance was no more sad. <hi>Ezekiah</hi> in his sicknesse chattered like a Swallow,<note place="margin">Esay 38. 14. 20.</note> and mourned as a Dove; but after his prayer he sung<note place="margin">Hab. 3. 2. 16. 18. 19.</note> songs of deliverance to the stringed instruments. <hi>Haba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knk</hi> before his prayer trembled, but after his prayer hee triumphed in the midst of death. <hi>David</hi> full of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<note place="margin">Psal. 6. 6. 9.</note> and of gronings in his prayer, but after as full of comfort against all his enemies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as Irregular Cares are needlesse and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, so they are <hi>sinnefull too.</hi> First, In regard of their <hi>obiect,</hi> they are <hi>worldly cares,</hi> the Cares of the men of this world: therein wee declare our selves to walke in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie to the Gentiles, as if wee had no better founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of quietnesse and contentment then the heathen<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 17. Matth. 6. 32.</note> which know not God. And this is Christs argument, after all these things do <hi>the Gentiles seeke.</hi> We are taken out of the world, wee have not received the spirit of the world,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 10. 1. Cor. 2. 10. Rom. 12. 2. Psal. 4. 3. Tit. 2. 14. 1. Pet. 2. 9. Cyprian.</note> and therefore wee must not bee conformable unto the world, nor bring forth the fruits of a worldly spirit, but walke as men that are set apart, as a peculiar people, and that have heavenly promises, and the Grace of God to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish our hearts. <hi>Illi terrena sapiant qui promissa coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestia non habent,</hi> It is seemely for those alone who have no other portion but in this life, to fixe their thoughts and cares here. Secondly, they are sinnefull in regard of their <hi>Causes,</hi> and they are principally <hi>two.</hi> First, <hi>Inordinate lust or coveting,</hi> the running of the heart after covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; Secondly, <hi>Distrust of Gods providence,</hi> for those<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 3.</note> desires which spring from lust can never have faith to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the heart in the expectation of them. Lastly, they are sinnefull in their <hi>Effects.</hi> First, They are <hi>murthering</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>cares,</hi> they worke sadnesse, suspicions, uncomfortablenes,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16278:59"/>
and at last death. Secondly, They are <hi>Choaking cares,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 13. 22.</note> they take of the heart from the word, and thereby make it unfruitfull. Thirdly, they are <hi>Adulterous cares,</hi> they<note place="margin">Iam 4 4.</note> steale away the heart from God, and set a man at enmity against him. In all which respects wee ought to arme our selves against them.</p>
                  <p>Which that we may the better doe, wee will in the last place propose two sorts of directions. First, <hi>How to make the Creature no vexing Creature.</hi> Secondly, <hi>How to vse it as a vexing Creature:</hi> for the former. First, <hi>pray for conveniencie,</hi> for that which is suteable to thy minde, I meane not to the lusts, but to the abilities of thy minde. Labour ever to sure thy occasions to thy parts, and thy supplies to thy occasions. If a ship out of greedinesse be overloaden with gold, it will be in danger of sinking, notwithstanding the capacity of the sides be not a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter filled; on the other side fill it to the brimme with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and it will still tosse up and downe for want of due ballasting: so is it in the lives of men, some have such gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy desires, that they thinke they can runne through all sorts of businesse and so never leave loading themselves, till their hearts sinke and be swallowed up with worldly sorrow and securitie in sinne: others set their affections on such triviall things, that though they should have the fill of all their desires, their mindes would still be as floating and unsetled as before. Resolve therefore to do with thy selfe as men with their ships. There may a Tempest arise, when thou must be constrained to throw out all thy wares into the Sea; such were the times of the Apostles and after bloudy persecutions, when men were put to forfake Father, Mother, Wife, Children, nay to have the ship it selfe broken to pieces, that the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner within might escape upon the ruines. But besides this, in the calmest and securest times of the Church these two things thou must ever looke to, if thou tender thine owne tranquillity. First, <hi>fill not thy selfe onely with light</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:16278:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>things.</hi> Such are all the things of this world in themselves, besides the roome and cumbersomenesse of them (as light things take up ever the most roome) they still leave the soule floating and unsetled. Doe therefore as wise Mariners, have strong and substantiall ballasting in the bottome, faith in Gods promises, love and feare of his name, a foundation of good workes, and then what ever becomes of thy other loading, thy ship it selfe shall bee safe at last, thou shalt be sure in the greatest tempest to have thy life for a prey. Secondly, <hi>Consider the burden of thy Vessell;</hi> All ships are not of an equall capacity, and they must be fraighted, and mann'd, and victualed with proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their burden. Al men have not the same abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, some have such a measure of grace as enables them with much wisedome and improvement to manage such an estate as would puffe up another with pride, sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, superciliousnesse, and forgetfulnesse of God. Againe some men are fitted to some kinde of employments, not to others, as some ships are for merchandise, others for warre; and in these varieties of states every man should pray for that which is most suteable to his disposition and abilities, which may expose him to fewest temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or at least by which he may bee most serviceable in the body of Christ, and bring most glory to his Master. This was the good prayer of <hi>Agur,</hi> give me neither po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty nor riches, feed me with <hi>food convenient for me:</hi> this is that we all pray, Give us <hi>Our daylie Bread,</hi> that which is most proportion'd to our condition, that which is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for us to have, and most advantageous to the ends of that Lord whom wee serve.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, labour ever to <hi>get Christ into thy ship,</hi> hee will check every tempest, and calme every vexation that growes upon thee. When thou shalt consider that his truth, and person, and honor is imbarked in the same ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell with thee, thou maist safely resolve on one of these, either he will be my Pilot in the ship, or my planke in the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16278:60"/>
Sea to carry me safe to Land; if I suffer in his companie, and as his member, he suffers with me, and then I may triumph to be made any way conformable vnto Christ my head. If I have Christ with me, there can no estate come which can be cumbersome unto me. Have I a load of misery and infirmity inward, outward, in minde, body, name or estate, this takes away the vexation of all, when I consider it all comes from Christ, and it all runnes into Christ. It all comes from him as the wise disposer of his owne bodie, and it all runnes into him as the compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate sharer with his owne bodie: It all comes from him who is the distributer of his Fathers gifts, and it all runns into him who is the partaker of his members sorrows. If I am weake in body, Christ my head was wounded, if<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 9. Phil. 2 7. Matth. 12. 24. Act. 27. 23.</note> weake in minde, Christ my head was heavie unto death. If I suffer in my estate, Christ my head became poore, as poore as a servant, if in my name Christ, my head was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed vile, as vile as <hi>Beelzebub. Paul</hi> was comforted in the greatest tempest with the presence of an Angel, how much more with the Grace of Christ; when the Thorne was in his flesh, and the buffets of Satan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7. 9.</note> his soule, yet then was his presence a plentifull protection, my Grace is sufficient for thee, and hee confesseth it elsewhere, I am able to doe all things<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 13.</note> through Christ that strengthens me. Christs head hath sanctified any thornes, his back any surrowes, his hands any nailes, his side any speare, his heart any sorrow that can come to mine. Againe, have I a great estate, am I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with abundance of earthly things, this takes away all the Vexation that I have Christ with me; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to sanctifie it, his wisedome to manage it, his glory to be by it advanced, his word to be by it maintained, his Anointed Ones to be by it supplied, his Church to be by it repaired, in one word his poverty to be by it relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For as Christ hath strength and compassion to take of the burden of our afflictions, so hath he poverty too,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16278:60"/>
to ease that vexation which may grow from our abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. If thou hadst a whole wardrobe of cast apparrell, Christ hath more nakednesse then all that can cover; if whole barnes ful of corne, and cellars of wine, Christ hath more empty bowels then al that can fill; if all the pretious drugs in a country, Christ hath more sicknes then all that can cure; if the power of a mighty Prince, Christ hath more imprisonment then all that can enlarge; if a whole house full of silver and gold, Christ hath more distressed members to be comforted, more breaches in his Church to be repaired, more enemies of his Gospel to be oppos'd, more defenders of his faith to be supplied, more urgencies of his Kingdom to be attended, then al that wil serve for. Christ professeth himself to be still hungry, naked, sick, and<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> in prison, and to stand in need of our visits and supplies. As all the good which Christ hath done is ours, by reason of our communion with him, so all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>The last direction which I shall give to remove the vexation of the Creature is out of the text, and that is, <hi>To keepe it from thy Spirit,</hi> not to suffer it to take up thy thoughts and inner man. They are not <hi>nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> but <hi>viatica</hi> onely, and a mans heart ought to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his businesse and not upon accessories. If in a tempest men should not addresse themselves to their offices, to loose the tacklings, to draw the pumpe, to strike sailes, and lighten the vessell, but should make it their sole worke to gaze upon their commodities, who could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that a calme should droppe into such mens laps. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved when the Creatures have rais'd a tempest of vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thinke upon your Offices, to the pumpe, to powre out thy corruptions, to the sailes and tackling, abate thy lusts and the provisions of them, to thy faith, to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove hope, to thy patience, It is the Lord, let him doe as seemeth good to him, to thy thankfulnesse, the Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and the Lord taketh away, Blessed be the name of the Lord. If <hi>Iob</hi> should have gazed on his children or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, he might have been swallowed up in the storme; but God was in his heart, and so the vessell was still safe.

                  <p>To set the heart on the Creature denotes three things. First, to pitch a mans thoughts and studies, to direct all the restlesse enquiries of his soule upon them, and the good he expects from them.

Secondly, to care for, to employ a mans affections of love, delight, desire upon them, to set a high price on them, and over-rate them above other things.

                     <hi>Idolaters,</hi> because they preferre monie, as a man doth his God, before all other things. When the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would have comforted the wife of <hi>Phineas</hi> with the birth of a sonne, after the captivitie of the Arke, it is said <hi>she regarded it not,</hi> the Text is, <hi>she did not put her heart</hi>

                     <hi>upon it:</hi> though a woman rejoyce when a man childe is borne, yet in comparison of the Arke she no more regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the joy of a sonne, then a man would doe if the sunne should be blotted out of heaven, and a little starre put in the roome; and therefore, though children be the glory<note place="margin">Hos. 9. 11.</note> of their parents, yet shee professeth that there was no glory in this to have a sonne, and lose an Arke, a starre without light, a sonne without service, a levite borne and no Arke to waite upon; and therefore she did not set her heart upon it. They will not <hi>set their heart upon us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Sam. 18. 3.</note> say the people to <hi>David,</hi> for thou art worth ten thousand of us; that is, they will no whit regard us in comparison of thee: so then a mans heart is set on the Creature, when
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16278:62"/>
he prizeth it above other things, and declareth this esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his heart by those eager endeavours with which he pursueth them as his God and Idoll. Thirdly, to relie upon, to put trust and affiance in the Creature: and this is imported in the word by which the Prophet expresseth riches, which signifieth strength of all sorts, <hi>vires,</hi> and <hi>propugnaculum,</hi> the inward strength of a man and the outward strength of munition and fortification: therefore, saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> the rich mans wealth is his<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 15. Psal 49. 6. 1. Tim. 6. 17. Ier. 9. 23.</note> strong city, and rich men are said to Trust and Glorie in their riches, examples whereof the Scripture abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives in Tyre, Babylon, Ninive, Edom, Israel, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now a man ought not thus to <hi>set his heart on the Creature;</hi> first, because of the <hi>Tendernesse and delicacie of the spirit,</hi> which will quickely be bruiz'd with any thing that lies close upon it and presseth it. As men weare the softest garments next their skinne, that they be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, so should we apply the tenderest things, the mercies and the worth of the bloud of Christ, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of grace and glory, the precepts and invitations of the Spirit unto our spirits. And now as subterraneous winde or ayre being pressed in by the earth, doth often beget concussions and earth-quakes; so the spirit of a man being swallow'd up and quite clos'd in earthly things must needs beget tremblings and distractions at last to the soule. The word heere which we translate Vexation is rendred likewise by <hi>Contritio, a pressing, grinding, wearing away of a thing,</hi> and by <hi>Depastio, a feeding on a thing,</hi> which makes some render the words thus, <hi>All is vanitie and a feeding upon winde.</hi> That as windie meates, though they fill and swell a man up, they nourish little, but turne into crudities and diseases; so the feeding upon the Creature may puffe up the heart, but it can bring no reall satisfaction, no solid nutriment to the soule of man. The Creature upon the spirit is like a worme in wood, or a moth in a garment, it begets a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16278:62"/>
rottennesse of heart, it bites asunder the threads and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of the soule, and by that meanes workes an inep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and undisposednesse to any worthy service, and brings a decay upon the whole man; for cares will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent age, and change the colour of the haire before the<note place="margin">Hos. 7. 9. 11.</note> time, and make a man like a silly Dove, without any heart, as the Prophet speakes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because <hi>the strength of every man is his spirit; Mens cujus<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        </expan>.</hi> Now if the Creature seize on a mans strength, it serues him as <hi>Dalilah</hi> did <hi>Sampson,</hi> it will quickely let in the Philistines to vexe him. <hi>Strength hath Two parts</hi> or offices, <hi>Passive</hi> in undergoing and withstanding evill, and <hi>Active</hi> in doing that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a man to doe. Now when the heart and spirit of a man is set upon any Creature, it is weakned in both these respects.</p>
                  <p>First, it is <hi>disabled from bearing or withstanding evill.</hi> We will consider it, First <hi>in temptations;</hi> Secondly <hi>in afflictions.</hi> First, A man who hath set his heart inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately upon any Creature is altogether unfit to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any temptation. In the Law when a man had new married a wife, he was not to goe to warre that<note place="margin">Deut. 24. 5.</note> yeere, but to rejoyce with his wife. One reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I suppose was this, because when the minde is strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set upon any one object, till the strength of that desire be abated, a man will be utterly unfit to deale with an enemie: so is it with any lust to which a man weds himselfe, it altogether disables him to resist any enemie: after <hi>Hannibals</hi> armie had melted themselves at Capua with sensualitie and luxurie, they were quite strangers to hard service and rigid discipline, when they were againe reduc'd unto it.</p>
                  <p>The Reason hereof is, first <hi>The subtiltie of Satan,</hi> who will be sure to proportion his temptations to the heart, and those lusts which doe there predominate, setting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men with those perswasions wherewith he is mos

If the former, God hath taught mee to call it mine owne already, giue us <hi>our Bread,</hi> and not to goe to the Divels shambles to fetch it; If the other, though God should suffer the Divell to giue it, yet he sends a curse into our mouths along with it.

On the other side, Let Sathan threaten <hi>Ieroboam</hi> with the losse of his kingdome, if hee goe up to Ierusalem, and serve God in the way of his owne worship, and that is argument enough to draw him and all his successors to notorious and Egyptian idolatry; and the reason was because their hearts were more set upon their owne Counsels, then upon the worship or truth of God.

If men then could keepe these things from their spirits, they should ever conceive of them according to their owne narrow being, and so keepe their hearts from that hardnesse which the Creatures, destitute of Gods blessing, doe there beget, and so worke in the soule a disposition suteable to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations.</p>

                  <p>Let us see in some few particulars what impotency unto any good the Creatures bring upon the hearts of men. To <hi>Pray</hi> requires a hungry spirit, a heart convinc'd of its owne emptinesse, a desire of intimate communion with God; but now the Creature drawes the heart, and all the desires thereof to it selfe, as an ill splene doth the nourishment in a body. Lust makes men pray amisse,<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 3.</note> fixeth the desires onely on its owne provisions, makes a man unwilling to be carried any way towards heaven but his owne. The Young Man prayed unto Christ to shew him the way to eternall life; but when Christ told<note place="margin">Mark. 10. 21. 22</note> him that his riches, his covetousnes, his bosome lust stood betweene him and salvation, his prayer was turned into sorrow, repentance and apostacy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Meditation</hi> requires a sequestration of the thoughts, a minde unmixt with other cares, a syncere and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted relish of the Word; now when the heart is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest with lust, and taken up with another treasure, it is<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 21.</note> as impossible to be weaned from it, as for an hungry Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle (a Creature of the sharpest sight to fixe upon, and of<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 28.</note> the sharpest appetite to desire its object) to forbeare the body on which it would prey; as unable to conceive aright of the pretiousnesse and power of the Word, as a feaverish palate to taste the proper sweetnesse of the meate it eates.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Hearing</hi> the Word, the heart can never accept Gods Commands, till it be first empty, a man cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the richest gift that is, with a hand that was full be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now thornes, which are the cares of the World, filling the heart, must needs choake the feede of the Word. The Pharisees and Lawyers rejected the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell<note place="margin">Luk. 7. 29. 30.</note>

of God against themselves, because their pride would not let them yeeld to such a baptisme, or to such a doctrine as requires emptinesse, confession of sinnes, justifying of God, and condemning of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (for these were the purposes of <hi>Iohus</hi> Baptisme, and of the preaching of repentance.) That man comes but to bee rejected who makes love to one who hath fixt her heart and affection already. A man must come to Gods Word as to a Physitian, <hi>a meere patient</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 12. 13.</note> without reservations, or exceptions, he must set his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions as an open marke for the word to shoot at, hee must not come with capitulations and provisoes, but lay downe the body of sinne before God to have every earthly member hewed of. Till a man come with such a<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 21.</note> resolution as to be willing to part from all naughtinesse, hee will never receive the ingrafted Word with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and an honest heart; a man will never fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ in the wayes of his Word, till first he have learned to denie himselfe, and his owne lusts. Nay if a man should binde his devotion to his heart <hi>With v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ws,</hi> yet a <hi>Dalila</hi> in his bosome, a lust in his spirit, would easily nullifie the strongest vowes. The Iewes made a serious and solemne protestation to <hi>Ieremie</hi> that they would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey<note place="margin">Ier. 42. 5. 6.</note> the voyce of the Lord in that which they desired him to enquire of God about whether it were good or evill; and yet when they found the message crosse their owne lusts and reservations, their resolutions are turned into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, their pride quickly breakes asunder their vow, and they tell the Prophet to his face that hee dealt falsly<note place="margin">Ier. 43. 2.</note> between God and them; a refuge which they were well<note place="margin">Ier. 5. 12. Ier. 17. 15. 2. Chro. 36. 16.</note> acquainted with before. Some when then conscience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakens and begins to disquiet them, make vowes to bind themselves vnto better obedience, and formes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; but as <hi>Sampson</hi> was bound in vaine with any cords so long as his haire grew into its length; so in vaine doth any man binde himselfe with vowes, so long as he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth

                     </gap>unatick, very easily broken asunder. This is not the right way. First, labour with thy heart, clense out thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, purge thy life as the Prophet did the waters, with seasoning and rectifying the fountaine: Tis one thing to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ase from a present paine, another thing to roote out the disease it selfe. If the chinkes in a ship bee unstopt, 'tis in vaine to labour at the pumpe; so long as there is a constant in let, the water can never be exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted; so is it in these formall resolutions and vowes, they may ease the present paine, let out a little water, restraine from some particular acts, but so long as the heart is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purged, lust will returne and predominate. In a word whereas in the Service of God there are two maine things required, faith to begin, and courage or patience to goe through, lust hinders both these. How can yee beleeve since yee seeke for glory one from another? Ioh. 5. 44. when persecution arose because of the word, the Temporary was presently offended. Matth. 13. 21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly in one word. A man ought not to set his Heart on the Creature because of the <hi>Noblenesse of the heart.</hi> To set the heart on the creature is to set a diamond in lead, None are so mad to keep their Iewels in a cellar, and their coales in a closet; and yet such is the profannesse of wicked men to keepe God in their lips on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Mammon in their hearts, to make the earth their treasure, and heaven but as an accessorie and appendix to that. And now as <hi>Samuel</hi> spake unto <hi>Saul,</hi> set not thine heart upon thine Asses, for the desire of Israel is upon<note place="margin">1. Sam. 9. 20.</note> thee; Why should a Kings heart be set upon Asses? so may I say, why should Christians hearts be set upon earthly things, since they have the desires of all flesh to fix upon?</p>
                  <p>I will conclude with one word upon the last particu lar, How to use the Creatures as Thornes, or as vexing

Secondly, Be arm'd when thou touchest, or medlest with them: Arm'd against the Lusts and against the Temptations that arise from them. Get faith to place thy heart upon better promises; enter not upon them without prayer unto God, that since thou art going amongst snares, he would carry thee through with wisedome and faithfulnesse, and teach thee how to use them as his blessings and as instruments of his glory. Make a covenant with thine heart, as <hi>Iob</hi> with his eyes, have a jealousie and suspicion of thine evill heart, lest it be surpriz'd, and bewitched with finfull affections.

                     <hi>revived,</hi> I found that that was but a sopor, a benumd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which was in my apprehension a death of sinne: and <hi>I died,</hi> had experience of the falsenesse and miseries of my presumptions. The life of sinne and the life of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are like the ballances of a paire of scoles, when one goes up the other must fall downe, when sinne lives, the man must dye; man and sinne are like <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Many excellent points, and of great consequence to the spirits of men would rise out of these words thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded: as, First, that a man may have the Law in the Church wherein he lives in the letter of it, and yet bee without the Law in the power and spirit of it by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, misconstructions, false glosses, and perverse wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings of it; as a covetous man may have the possession of monie, and yet be without the vse and comforts of it. 2. Cor. 3. 6. 2. P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Which should teach us to beware of Ignorance; It makes the things which wee have unusefull to us. If any man have the Law indeed hee will labour First to have more acquaintance with it, and with God by it. The more the Saints know of God and his will, the neere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> communion doe they desire to have with him. Wee see this heavenly affection in <hi>Iacob.</hi> Gen. 32. 26. 29. Gen. 49. 18. in <hi>Moses.</hi> Exod. 33. 12. 18. in <hi>David.</hi> Psal 119. 18. 125. <hi>in the Spouse</hi> Cant. 1. 2. in <hi>Manoah.</hi> Iud. 13. 17. in <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 2.

Secondly, to be more conformable unto it, to Iudge and measure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the oftner by it. Psal. 119. 11. The law is utterly in

                  <p>Secondly, ignorance of the true meaning of the Law, and resting upon false grounds doth naturally beget these two things.

                     </gap>, a Doctrine that <hi>comes</hi> unto us, and is brought by that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred blast of the spirit which bloweth where he lifteth. We doe not first come and are then taught, but first we are taught and then we Come. Ioh. 6. 45. Esai. 55. 5. 65. 1. we must take heed of attributing to our selves, boasting of our owne sufficiencies, congtuities, preparations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currencies, contributions unto the word in the saving of us; Grace must prevent, follow, assist us, preoperate and cooperate, Christ must be <hi>All in All, the Author and the Finisher of our faith;</hi> of our selves we can doe nothing but disable our selves, resist the spirit, and pull downe whatever the word doth build up within us.

in the voyce which cryes unto thee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, though sinne seeme dead to secure, civill, morall, superstitiously zealous men, in regard of any present sense or sting, yet all that while it is <hi>alive</hi> in them, and will certainely, when the booke shall be opened, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ministry of the word to conversion, or in the last judgement to condemnation, reviue againe. All these points are very naturall to the Text, but I should be too long a stranger to the course I intend if I should insist on them. I returne therefore to the maine purpose. Here is the state of sinne, <hi>sinne revived;</hi> the Guilt of sinne, <hi>I died;</hi> the Conviction of it by the spirit bringing the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sense of the <hi>Commandement,</hi> and writing it in the heart of a man, and so pulling him away from his owne Conclusions.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines then which I shall insist on are these two. First, <hi>the spirit by the Commandement convinceth a man to be in the state of sinne.</hi> Secondly, <hi>the spirit by the Commandement convinceth a man to be in the state of death because of sinne.</hi> To convince a man that he is in the state of sinne is To make a man so to set to his owne seale and serious acknowledgement to this truth That he is a sinner, as that withall he shall feele within himselfe the qualitie of that estate, and in humility and selfe-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrencie conclude against himselfe all the naughtinesse and loathsome influences which are proper to kindle and catch in his nature and person by reason of that estate: and so not in expression onely but in experience, not in word but in truth, not out of feare but out of loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not out of constraint but most willingly, not out of formality but out of humility, not according to the generall voyce but out of a serious scrutinie and selfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, loade and charge himselfe with all the noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse and venome, with all the dirt and garbage, with all the malignitie and frowardnesse that his nature and person doe abound withall even as the waves of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16278:74"/>
the sea with mire and dirt; and thereupon justifie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, when he doth charge him with all this, yea if he should condemne him for it.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to shew two things. First, that a meere naturall light will never thus farre convince a man. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the spirit by the <hi>Commandement</hi> doth. Some<note place="margin">Act. 17. 23. 27.</note> things nature is sufficient to teach, God may be felt and found out in some fence by those that ignorantly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him. Nature doth convince men that they are not so good as they should be, the Law is written in the<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 15.</note> hearts of those that know nothing of the letter of it; I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlenesse, beastiality, lying, luxury the Cretian poet could<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 12, 13.</note> condemne in his owne countrey-men; Drinking of<note place="margin">Ester. 1. 8.</note> healths <hi>ad plenoscalices,</hi> by measure and constraint, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by Law of a heathen prince, and that in his luxurie.

                  <p>This conviction then of sinne the spirit worketh: First, by revealing the Rule: Secondly, by opening the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the state of sinne: Thirdly, by giving a heart ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally and reflexively to understand all, or by shaping and framing the heart to the Word, and so min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling them both together.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle saith, that <hi>By the Commandement sinne revived.</hi> By the life of sinne I understand <hi>the strength</hi> of it, and that is twofold: A strength to condemne, and a strength to operate, or worke in a man obedience to it selfe: a strength to hold a man fast, and to carry him its owne way. Sin is a body, and hath <hi>earthly members,</hi> Col. 3. 4. which are very active &amp; vigorous; the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of a <hi>holding</hi> propertie which it hath, Rom. 7. 6. and this strength hath the sinewes of all strength in it; It is a <hi>Lord,</hi> and so it hath the strength of <hi>power</hi> to command, and it is a <hi>husband,</hi> and so it hath the strength of <hi>love</hi> to perswade and prevaile.</p>
                  <p>First, it is a <hi>Lord</hi> and Master, in which respect it hath these tyes upon us: First, a <hi>Covenant,</hi> there is a virtuall bargaine betweene lust and a sinner, Esay 28. 15. we make promise of <hi>serving,</hi> and obeying sinne, Ioh. 8. 34. Rom. 6. 16. and that returneth unto us the <hi>wages of iniquitie,</hi> and the <hi>pleasures of sinne,</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 15. Heb. 11. 25. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, love unto it, as unto a <hi>bountifull</hi> and beneficiall<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 25.</note> Lord. Sinne exerciseth authority over us, and yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it our benefactor, Hos 2. 5. 12. 13. Iob 20. 12. 13. Thirdly, an easie service, the worke of sinne is naturall, the instruments all ready at hand, the helpers and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants many to teach, to encourage, to hasten, and lead
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16278:77"/>
on in the broad way. Fourthly, in sinne it selfe there is a great strength to enforce men to its service: First, it is edg'd with malice against the soule, arm'd with weapons<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 11.</note> to fight against it, and enmity is a great Whetstone to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Secondly, it is attended with fleshly wisedome, suppported with stratagems and deceits, hastened and set on by the assistance of Satan and the world, Eph. 4. 22 Heb. 3. 13. Thirdly, it hath a Iudicature and regiment in the heart, it governes by a Law, it f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Pet. 2. 10. Rom. 7. 23. In one word, the strong man is furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a <hi>whole Armour.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, sinne is a <hi>Husband,</hi> Rom. 7. 1. 5. and so it hath the power of love, which the wise Man saith, <hi>is as strong as death,</hi> that will have no deniall when it comes. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels vs, there is a <hi>constraining power</hi> in love, 2. Cor. 5. 14. Who stronger then <hi>Sampson,</hi> and who weaker then a woman? yet by love she overcame him, whom all the Philistimes were unable to deale with. Now as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a man and a strumpet, so betweene lust and the heart, there are first certaine cursed dalliances and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by alluring temptations, the heart is <hi>drawne away</hi> from the sight of God and his Law, and <hi>enticed</hi> and then followes the accomplishment of uncleannesse. Iam. 1. 14. 15. This in the generall is that life or strength of sinne here spoken of.</p>
                  <p>Wee are next to observe, that the ground of all this is the Law: <hi>The sting of Death is sinne, and the strength of sinne is the Law,</hi> 1. Cor. 15. 56 1. Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. 4. from the Law it is, that sinne hath both strength to condemne, and to

Where there are three reasons to shew Gods Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call purpose in the publication of the Law anew. First, it was not published alone, but as an Additament, with relation to the Evangelicall promise which was before made. Secondly, the service of Angels, or Messengers; which shewes, that in the Law God did send from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven anew to instruct men, and therein to take care of them, and prepare them for salvation; for <hi>Angels mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> for this purpose, <hi>that men might be heires of salvation.</hi> Thirdly, the ministry of a Mediator, namely, <hi>Moses,</hi> who<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 5.</note> was Mediator in the Law, with reference whereunto Christ is cald <hi>Mediator of a better Covenant,</hi> and was<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 6.</note>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:16278:81"/>
faithfull as <hi>Moses.</hi> Now where there is a Mediator ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 6.</note> therein God declares his purpose to enter anew into a treaty with men, and to bring them to termes of agreement and reconciliation with him. Men were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels against God, held under the sentence of death and vengeance; they are in darkenesse, know not whither they goe, are well pleasde with their owne estate, give no heed to any that would call them out. For this reason, because God is willing to pull me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the fire, he sends first <hi>Moses</hi> armed with thunder, and brightnesse, which<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 30. 2. Cor. 3. 7.</note> can not be endur'd (for the shining of <hi>Moses</hi> his face, which the people could not abide, denotes the exceeding purity and brightnesse of the Law, which no sinner is able<note place="margin">Deut. 5 25. Heb. 2. 15. Rom. 8. 15. Heb. 12. 18-20.</note> with peace to looke on) and he shews them whither they are hastning, namely to eternall death, and like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell that met <hi>Balaam</hi> in a narrow roome shuts them in, that either they must turne backe againe, or else bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed: and in this fright, and anguish, Christ, <hi>the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of a better covenant,</hi> presents himselfe, as a Sanctuary and refuge from the condemnation of the Law. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is universalitie of <hi>men,</hi> and in men universality of parts, All men, and every part of man shut up under the guilt and power of this sinne. Both these the Apostle proves at large, <hi>Iewes, Gentiles, all under sinne, none righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi>

                     <hi>selves, and there is no truth in us.</hi> More particularly, wee<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 8.</note> must distingvish both of Death and of sinne. There is a twofold Death; an Actuall, or Naturall Death, when the essentiall parts of a living Creature are taken asunder, and the whole dissolved: and a Virtuall or Legall Death; when though the party bee naturally Alive, yet hee is <hi>Dead in Law,</hi> and that notes two things: First, a designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto a certaine Death at hand, and ready to bee exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted: Secondly, a disabilitie unto many purposes which lay before in the mans power; as a man condemn'd, though hee have his life out of indulgence for a short space, yet hee is then set apart, and appointed for death, and in the very sentence disabled to order or dispose of any thing which was then his owne. When a woman is divorced for adultery from her husband, though she bee Alive naturally, yet Legally and to the purpose of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage she is Dead to her husband, so that though shee should live in the same house, yet she should have nothing to doe with his bed or body. And thus the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of <hi>sinfull Widowes, that they are Dead while they Live,</hi> 1. Tim. 5. 6.</p>
                  <p>In sin likewise we may consider, The guilt of it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it makes us accursed; and the dominion of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it bringeth us into bondage: in these two principally consists the life and the strength of sinne, which it hath from the Law. Now by being <hi>baptized into Christ wee are delivered from the Law.</hi> Rom. 6. 14. Gal. 3. 25. First, from the <hi>covenant of the Law,</hi> Christ hath put an utter period to the Law <hi>quoad officium Iustificandi, hee is the end of the Law for righteousnesse.</hi> Wee are righteous now<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> by <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Donation,</hi> not by <hi>nature,</hi> or <hi>operation:</hi> by<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20. 21.

Ephes. 2. 8. 10.</note> the righteousnesse of God, not that whereby God is righteous, but that <hi>which God is pleased to give us,</hi> and stands in opposition to a mans owne righteousnesse, which is by working.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the <hi>Rigor of the Law</hi> which requires
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:16278:85"/>
perfect, and perpetuall obedience, Gal. 3. 10. Though the<note place="margin">Planè dicimus decessisse legem quoad onera, non quoad Iustiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.

Sam. 23. 5.</note> priviledge of the church. Wee are not therefore rigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound either to a full habituall holinesse in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which is supplied by the <hi>merit of Christ,</hi> nor to a through actuall obedience in our services, which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the <hi>Intercession of Christ.</hi> Wee are at the best full of weakenesse, many remnants of the old <hi>Adam</hi> hang about us, this is all the comfort of a man in Christ, that his desires are <hi>accepted,</hi> God regards the sincerity of his<note place="margin">2.

Hos. 14 5.</note> delivered from the rigour of the Law, which yet is thus to be understood; That though wee bee still bound to all the Law as much as ever under perill of sinne (for so much as the best come short of fullfilling all the Law, so much they sinne) yet not under paine of Death which is the rigour of the Law. And therefore</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee are delivered from the <hi>Curse of the Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> from the vengeance and wrath of God against sin. <hi>Christ was made a curse for us,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, from the <hi>Irritation of the Law,</hi> and all compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorie and slavish obedience: we love by Christ all the principles and grounds of true obedience put into vs. First, <hi>knowledge</hi> of Gods will, the spirit of Revelation,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 9.

                  </p>
                  <p>Being thus Dead to the Law, we are truly Dead to sinne likewise, and sinne to us, but not universally. Dead in regard of its strength, but not in regard of its beeing. To apply then the premisses. Sin is <hi>Dead naturally quoad Reatum,</hi> in regard of the gvilt of it, that is, that actuall guilt of sin, wherby every man is borne a child of wrath, and made obnoxious to vengeance, is done quite away in our regeneration, and <hi>the obligations cancell'd.</hi> Col. 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, sinne is <hi>Dead Legally, quoad Regnum,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the dominion and government of it, in regard of the vigorous operation which is in it. First, sinne is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,</hi> Rom. 8. 3. and therein destinated, and design'd to death, It shall fully bee rooted out. Secondly, in the meane time, it is disabled from a plenarie Rule over the conscience, though the Christian be molested and pester'd with it, yet he doth not henceforth <hi>serve</hi> it, nor become its <hi>instrument,</hi> to bee subject in every motion thereof, as the weapon is to the hand that holds it: but Christ and his love beare the sway, and hold the Sterne in the heart, Rom. 6 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Thirdly, the sentence of the Law against sin is already in execution. But we are to note, that sinne though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnd to die, yet (such is the severity of God against it) it is adjudg'd to a <hi>lingring death,</hi> a death upon the Crosse:<note place="margin">Ut sentiat se mori. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The more time any man will spend to make himselfe acquainted with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, the more light of Gods Law hee will set up in his heart, the more he will begge of God to reveale the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his evill nature unto him, to make him see that <hi>abundance</hi> of the hart, That <hi>treasure</hi> of the hart, that <hi>Hell</hi> of the heart, that <hi>panoplie</hi> and <hi>magasin</hi> of sinne and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which is there; the more with the prodigall hee <hi>comes unto himselfe,</hi> and views that <hi>evill heart, that bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter roote</hi> which is in him: Certainely the more confusion and silence, and abhorrencie, &amp; condemnation will there be of himself, the more adoration of that boundlesse mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, of that bottomles puritie, which is able to pierce into every corner of so unsearchable a thing, able to clense eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hole and dungeon, and to enlarge it into a fit receptacle for the Prince of glory. Notable to this purpose is that place of S. <hi>Paul; If all prophesie, and there come in an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever</hi>

When men have their <hi>owne evil waies</hi> revealed unto them (which is ever done<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 63. Ezek. 36. 31.

It is nothing but ignorance that keepes men in pride.

Else wee must all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that hee which glorieth in any thing which is meerely from himselfe, hath chosen nothing to glory in but his owne shame.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, consider the <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of this sinne, to command, to execute, to bring about what ever it hath projected for the advancement of Satans king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. It hath the <hi>power</hi> of a King, It <hi>reignes in our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 12. Rom. 7. 23.</note> and it hath the strength of a <hi>Law,</hi> it is a <hi>Law in our members;</hi> and a Law without strength is no Law: for Lawes are made to binde, and hold men fast; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle cals lust a <hi>Law,</hi> because it commands, and holds under all our members to the obedience of it. Therefore wicked men are call'd the <hi>Servants of sinne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob. 8. 34.</note> and the best of us are <hi>Captives,</hi> that is, unwilling ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> Which notes such a strength of sinne, as cannot <hi>ex toto</hi> be altogether withstood. So much flesh and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcisednesse as a man hath in him, so much disabilitie likewise hath he to withstand sinne.</p>
                  <p>In the wicked it hath an <hi>absolutenesse,</hi> an universall and uncontroled power; First, they cannot but sinne, they can doe nothing but sinne; <hi>Without faith it is impossible</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6. Tit. 1. 15. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>to please God;</hi> and <hi>to the impure and uncleane every thing is uncleane.</hi> His mercies cruell, his prayers abomination, his offerings the sacrifice of fooles. Secondly, if they seeme to forsake any sinne, 'tis not of hatred to that, as a sinne (for <hi>he that said. Thou shalt not commit adultery, said</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 2. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>also, Thou shalt not kill)</hi> but it is because they preferre others before it. A man that hath many concubines may so dote upon some particulars, as that the rest haply may goe untouch'd, or but cursorily saluted; and yet that is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16278:94"/>
no argument of hatred to them, but of preferring the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. So a mans hart may be so take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> up with the pursuit of some <hi>Herodias,</hi> some darling lust, as that others may seeme utterly neglected, and scorn'd; when the truth is, <hi>The hart that playes the adulterer with any sin doth indeed hate none.</hi> Thirdly, if by the power of the Word they be frighted from the sinne they most love, yet lust will carry them to it againe, as a Sow returneth to the mire, or a man to his wife. Fourthly, if they should be so fir'd and terrified away, that they durst never actually returne againe; yet even then lust will make them wallow in <hi>speculatiue uncleannesse,</hi> their thoughts, their delights, their sighs, their byas would still hanker the other way. As lust may dog, and pester, and overtake a holy man that hates it, and yet hee hates it still; so the Word may frightand drive a wicked man from the sinne hee loves, and yet still hee loves it. Fifthly, this sinne as it keepes men in love with all sinne, so it keepes men off from all good duties. It is as a <hi>chaine</hi> upon all our faculties, an <hi>iron gate,</hi> that keepes out any good thought, or poysons it when it comes in.</p>
                  <p>In the faithfull themselves likewise it is exceeding <hi>strong,</hi> by antiperistasis from the Law, to deceive, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, sell as a slave, to make him doe that which he hated and allowed not, and not doe that which he would, and lov'd. It may seeme a paradoxe at the first, but it is a certaine truth, <hi>Originall sinne is stronger in the faithfull, then those very Graces which they have received.</hi> Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it thus. A man giveth to a prodigall sonne a great portion into his owne hands, and then gives over the care of him, and leaves him to himselfe; iin this Case, though the money of it selfe were sufficient to keepe him in good quality; yet his owne folly, and the Crowes that haunt the carkasse, those sharking companions that cleave to him, will suddenly exhaust a great estate. So if the Lord should give a man a stocke of Grace as much
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16278:95"/>
as <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> had, and there stop and furnish him with no further supplyes, but give over the care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of him, his lusts are so strong and cunning, as they would suddenly exhaust it all, and reduce him to nothing. For this is certaine, that to be preserved from the strength of our owne lusts, we have not onely use of the good graces which God hath given us already (<hi>per modum principij inhaerentis</hi>) but of a continued support and under propping (<hi>per modum principij adsistentis</hi>) of<note place="margin">

First, <hi>Wee are men,</hi> and what an impudence is it for the clay to swell against the potter that form'd it, and complaine why hast thou made me thus. Secondly, <hi>wee are sinners,</hi> all the punishments wee suffer are <hi>our owne,</hi> the wages of our iniquities, and what a madnesse is it to complaine against the justice of our Iudge? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>wee are living men</hi> and therefore God hath punished us lesse then our sinnes deserve, for the wages of sinne is death, and what ingratitude is it to repine at mercifull, and moderated punishments? but yet such is the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our nature that wee are very apt thus to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur; what is the cure and remedy of this evill affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>Let vs search and try our waies (saith the Church) and turne to the Lord our God;</hi> the more wee grow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our sinnefull estate, and marveilous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, with the patience and promises of God, the

more we shall justifie God, and waite upon him, the more wee shall judge our selves lesse then the least of<note place="margin">Mic. 7 9.</note> Gods mercies and forbearances. <hi>I will beare the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord,</hi> saith the Church againe in the same case, I will not repine nor murmure at his dealing with me, I will acknowledge that righteousnesse belongeth unto him, and confusion unto me, and the ground of this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is the sense of sinne, <hi>Because I have sinned against him.</hi> I have pressed, and wearied, and grieved, and vexed him with my sinnes, without any zeale or tendernesse of his glory; but he hath visited me in judgement and not in fury, in wrath he hath remembred mercy, and not quite consumed me as he might have done, he hath not dealt with me after my sinnes, nor rewarded me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to mine iniquities, he hath spared me as a sonne when I dealt with him as a traytor, and hee will pleade my cause, and bring me forth to the light, and revenge my quarrell against those which helped forward my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the way not to rage against Afflictions is to understand and be sensible of the foulenesse of our sinnes.

Now <hi>originall sinne is the corrupt nature of a man,</hi> and the motions therefore of it are not <hi>violent</hi> but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>naturall,</hi> and that naturall motion is set on and made the easier by the impulsions of Satan, as a stone throwne or hurried downeward moves the swifter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the naturall weight thereof is improv'd by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory impression. Who ever knew the Sea give over ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, or a streame grow weary of running? Now the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of corruption are as naturall as the estuations of the sea, or the course of a river. Though there may be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in fullfilling lusts, there can never be any in the rising and sprouting of lusts: As there may be paines in drawing water out of a Fountaine, but there can be no paines in the waters swelling or rising out of the Fountaine. It is no paines to conceive seede, though it bee to bring it forth in a birth: so in the <hi>begetting</hi> of sin, there is no paines requir'd for the heart to lust, for thoughts to arise, though
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16278:106"/>
the <hi>finishing</hi> of sinne may bee oftentimes painefull as well as deadly. <hi>Originall sinne</hi> is call'd by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile <hi>a Law in the members,</hi> which putteth a byas into them, a forwardnesse, and propension to all evill. Now as a Bowle moves not with any difficultie when it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the sway of its owne bias, so neither doth the heart in following lusts which are the weights and bias of the fleshlie soule. And therefore the longer any man lives in sinne, the sweeter 'tis to him. <hi>Wearinesse,</hi> and <hi>propensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are termes inconsistent.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Nothing is weary while it workes all De Suo,</hi> of it selfe, that which tyres a faculty is the fetching in of subsidiarie spirits, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exhausted and spent the faculty giveth over working, and is said to be wearie. The eye is never weary with the act of seeing (which is it owne worke) but it is said to bee weary, meerely because of the deficiency of those animall spirits which are from without sent in unto it to assist it in its owne worke, which if they did in the same measure and strength without decay flow to the facultie, it could never be tired in its owne operation. So the locomotive facultie, when the hand worketh, or the foote walketh, would never be wearied in it selfe, if those spirits which are requisite to strengthen it in its exercise did not lessen, and faile, and breath out in the motion. But now our lusts make us flesh all over, in them wee worke all <hi>de nostro</hi> of our owne; It is as naturall to the heart to lust, as it is to the eye to see, and in this respect more too; for though the Act of seeing bee the eyes alone, yet the eye stands in need of forraine assistance from the heart (which is the forge and seminarie of spirits) to continue the exercise of this Act: But the Heart is wholly within it selfe furnish'd with all the strength and principles of lusting, or if it were not, yet those spirits which the temptations of Satan or the world infuse to assist it, doe never faile nor waste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but as waters drawne out of a fountaine, the faster they are cald in, the more plentifully they come.</p>

Desires are the wings upon which the soule moves, if there be stil things found to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the desires, and none to satisfie them, no marvell if the soule be stil upon the wing, in perpetual agitation, like the wind which continually whirleth about, or the Rivers<note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 6, 7.</note> which never leave running into the Sea, because they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fill it.

Nay, as the water when it is stopt in its principall course, yet one way or other where it best may it will make a shift to finde a vent, and to discover it selfe: even so lust in the heart will one way or other, when the minde and faculties, the body and members are quite tyr'd out in the principall service, make a shift to breake forth into some easier vent. When the adultery in the heart hath worne out the body, and spur'd it so long in this uncleane race, that it now sinkes under the burden, and hath no more blood to lose, yet even then it will finde a vent, and such a man will have eyes full of adultery, a tongvefull of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, thoughts and speculations full of adultery, a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the review of former lewdnesse full of adultery. The thiefe on the Crosse had as good a will to crucifie Christ, to naile him, and pierce him as any others, but hee was fast enough for doing this; yet his malice will finde a vent into his tongve to revile and raile upon him. <hi>Balaams</hi> tongve could not execute the office to which hee was hir'd, yet it will have a vent, and shew it selfe in journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, counselling, and consulting how the people might draw a curse upon themselves. As a dogge may have his<note place="margin">Numb. 31. 16.

                  <p>What a watch then should we keepe over our evill hearts, what paines should wee take by prayer and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariednesse of spirit to suppresse this enemy? If there were any time wherein the flesh did sit still and sleepe, wherein the water did not runne, and seeke for vent, wee might then haply slacken our care; but since it is ever stirring in us, wee should bee ever stirring against it, and using all meanes to lessen and abate it: since the heart is unwearied in evill, we should not faint, nor be weary of well-doing. Since the heart is so abundant in evill, wee
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16278:109"/>
should abound likewise in every good work of the Lord, alwayes considering what advantage this labour will give us against the toyle of sinne: in lust a man wearieth himselfe and hath no hope, but here our labour is not in vaine in the Lord, wee shall reape if wee faint not; and a little glory in heaven, nay a little comfort in earth (though neither one nor other may be called little) will be a most plentifull recompence, pressed downe and running over for any the greatest paines that can bee taken in this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall watch. <hi>Yee have need of patience,</hi> saith the Apostle, to goe through the will of God, to bee in a perpetuall combate and defiance with an enemy that will give no respite nor breathing time. The temptations of Satan, the solicitations of the world are not so many, nor heauie clogs to men in their race, as that to which they are fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, this weight that presseth downe, this besieging sinne which is ever enticing, clamouring, haling, rebelling, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding, with love, with strength, with law, with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with importunities calling a man from his right way. From this consideration the Apostle immediately inferres this duty of patience, <hi>Lay aside every waight,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>and the sinne that doth so easily beset us, and runne with patience unto the race that is set before us.</hi> And we must not cast our eye alwayes to the clog which wee draw, that may much dis-hearten us; but looke unto Iesus, the Author and finisher of our faith, hee that can carry us through all these difficulties, that gives us wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, that teacheth our hands to warre, and our fingers to fight, that is our Captaine to leade us, and our second, (<gap reason="foreign">

Looke upon the Cloud of witnesses, those that are now the Church of the first-borne, and have their Palmes in their hands; they all went through the same combate, they were all beset with alike infirmities, they were all men of the same pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions with us, let us bee men of the same patience with them.</p>
                  <p>Now lastly, consider the <hi>Propagation</hi> of this sinne. Which may therefore well be called an old man, because it dies not, but passeth over from one generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; A mans Actuall sinnes are personall, and therefore Intransient, they begin and end in himselfe; but originall sinne is naturall, and therefore with the nature it passeth over from a man to his posteritie. It is an entaile that can never be cut of, it hath held from <hi>Adam</hi> and will so continue to the worlds end holding al men in an unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable service and villanage unto Satan the Prince of this world. In Humane Tenures if a man leave a personall estate to all his children indefinitely, without singling out and designing this portion to one and that to another, though it bee true to say that there is nothing in that estate which any one of the children can lay an entire clayme unto as his owne, but that the rest have joynt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in it, (for the children, though <hi>many in persons,</hi> are yet but <hi>one proprietarie</hi> in regard of right in the estate of their father, till there be a severance made) yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing a <hi>Partition</hi> may be legally procur'd, and there is a kinde of virtuall or fundamentall severance before, which was the ground of that which is afterwards reall and legall: But now in this wretched Inheritance of sin which <hi>Adam</hi> left to all his posterity, we are to note this mischiefe in the <hi>first</hi> place, that there is <hi>no virtuall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but it is left whole to every childe of <hi>Adam.</hi> All have it, and yet every one hath it all too. Soe that as Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16278:110"/>
say of the Reasonable soule, <hi>That it is whole in the whole, and that it is whole in every part:</hi> so wee may say of <hi>originall concupiscence,</hi> It is <hi>Tota in Genere Humano,</hi> and <hi>Tota in quolibet homine.</hi> All in mankinde, and all in every particular man. There is no law of partition for one man to have to him in peculiar the lusts of the eye, another to him the lusts of the tongue, another to him the lusts of the eare, &amp;c. but every man hath euery lust originally as full as all men together have it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to note a great difference further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soule &amp; sin in this regard; though all the soule be in every member as wel as in the whole body, yet it is not in the same manner and excellency in the parts as in the whole. For it is in the whole to all the purposes of life, sense, and motion, but in the parts the whole Soule serves but for some speciall businesses. All the soule is in the eye, and all in the eare, but not in either to all purposes, for it sees onely in the eye, and it heares onely in the eare; But originall sinne is all in every man, and it serves in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man to all purposes: Not in one man onely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adulterie, in another idolatry, in another murther, or the like, but in every man it serves to commit sinne against all the Law, to breake every one of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. A whole thing may belong wholly unto two men in severall, by diverse wayes of propriety, or unto sundry purposes; A house belongs wholly to the Landlord for the purpose of profit and revenew, and wholly to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for the purpose of use and inhabitation; but it seemes in ordinary reason impossible for the same thing to belong wholly to sundry men in regard of al purposes for which it serves. But such an ample propriety hath every man to originall sinne, that he holds it all, and to all purposes for which it serves. For though some sinnes there are which cannot by some men bee properly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (properly I say, because by way of provocation, or occasion, or approbation, or the like, one man may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16278:110"/>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> of a Minister, an unmarried man the sinnes of a husband, &amp;c. yet this disability ariseth out of the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of personall conditions, but no way out of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitednesse or impotency of originall sinne, which in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man serves to all the purposes which can consist with that mans condition; and as his condition alters, so is it likewise fruitfull unto new sinnes. And these are two great aggravations of this sinnefull inheritance That it comes <hi>whole</hi> unto every man; and that every man hath <hi>it unto all the purposes</hi> for which it serves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is to be observ'd that <hi>in originall sin</hi> (as in all other) there are two things, <hi>Deordination or sinfulnes, and Guilt or obligation unto punishment.</hi> And though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of these be inseparable from nature in this life yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that beleeveth and repenteth hath the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof taken away, it shall not prove unto him mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. But now this is the calamitie; Though a man have the guilt of this sinne taken of from his person by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his owne faith, and the grace of Christ to him: yet still both the deordination, and the guilt passeth over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his posteritie by derivation from him. For the former the case is most evident, what ever is borne of flesh is<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 6. Iob 14. 4.

Secondly, that<note n="m" place="margin">Ibid cap. 7. fol. 84. 8 &amp; Pelag. apud Aug. cont.

of originall righteousnesse is from God immediately, who pull'd away <hi>Adams</hi> righteousnesse from him; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no sinne.</p>
                  <p>For the more distinct understanding the whole truth, and answering these supposed strong reasons, give me leave to premise these observations by way of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.</p>
                  <p>First, there are Two things in originall sinne, <hi>The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>the corruption of nature;</hi> for since originall sinne is the roote of actuall, and in actuall sinnes there are both the omission of the good which we ought to exercise, and positive contuma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>To give some answer then to those pretended reasons.

                  <p>To the second three things are to be answer'd.

Consider it as a <hi>vice,</hi> and so wee say that lust, or flesh doth not belong to the parts as such or such parts, but is the disease of the whole nature, either part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of though it doe not equally descend from <hi>Adam,</hi> yet may hee justly bee esteem'd the Father and Fountaine of

the whole nature, because though generation doe not make all the materials and parts of nature, yet doth it worke to the uniting of them, and constituting of the whole by them. So then naturall corruption is <hi>from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Divell may bee put to flight, there is hope in a conflict with him, but lust may be exasperated by contention, it cannot bee shaken of.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer in the generall first, that it is <hi>our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> to fight with sinne, and it is <hi>Christs office</hi> and <hi>promise</hi> to overcome it, Wee must performe that which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us, and trust him with that which hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth unto us. Besides, by this meanes the bodie of sinne is <hi>first weakened,</hi> though not quite destroi'd. For as in the<note place="margin">Lev. 14. 41-45.</note> Leviticall Law when a spreading leprosie was in a house, the walls were first scraped round about, the dust throwne out, new stones and new morter put to the old materials, and then last of all the house upon the uncure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse of it was broken quite downe, and dissolved: so in our present leprous and corrupted condition, wee are to deface, to weaken, to scrape of what wee can of the body of sinne, and leave the rest for God to doe when hee shall be pleased to dissolve us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is by this meanes <hi>captivated</hi> likewise,<note place="margin">Iosh 9. 21. Num. 31. 18.

                  <p>Thirdly, however, by this meanes it is <hi>discover'd</hi> and it

is a good part of warre to know the latitude of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies strength, to prie into his stratagems and contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

And therefore to encourage and quicken us unto patience wee must not seeke our selves in our selves, nor fix upon the measure and proportion of our former gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but runne to our faith and hold fast our confidence, which will make us hope above hope, and bee strong when wee are weake: Wee must <hi>looke unto Iesus,</hi> and consider first, his <hi>grace</hi> which is sufficient for us, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his <hi>power,</hi> which hath already begunne faith and a good worke in us, Thirdly, his <hi>promise</hi> which is to finish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it for us, Fourthly, his <hi>compassion</hi> and assistance, he is our second, ready to come in in any danger and undertake the quarrell, Fifthly, his <hi>example,</hi> he passed through alike contradiction of sinners, as wee doe of lusts, Sixthly, his <hi>neerenesse,</hi> he is at the dore, it is yet but a <hi>little while, and he that shall come will come and will not tarry.</hi> Seventhly, his <hi>Glory</hi> which is in our quarrell engaged, and in our weakenesse perfected.

in the warre: In these things principally doth the strength of lust consist.</p>
                  <p>Having thus discovered wherein the strength of lust lies, set your selves against it in these particulars thereof. First, for the wisedome and deceite of lust: First set up a spirituall wisedome, which may discover and defeate the projects of the flesh; Christs teaching is the onely way to put off the old man, and to be renewed in the<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 20, 21.</note> spirit of the minde. Secondly, mutuall exhortation is a great helpe against the deceitfulnesse of sinne, <hi>Exho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>st any of you be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the deceitfulnesse of sinne.</hi> Silence is the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage an Enemie can have, when one doth not warne nor give notice to another. If a Cheate or cunning Spie should come to a place, and apply himselfe with severall ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nuations unto severall persons, for the better managing his purposes, and sifting out those discoveries which he is to make, the best way to disclose the plots and mischiefes of such an Enemie would be to conferre, and compare his severall passages and discourses together; so Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans mutuall communicating of the experiments, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conflicts, victories which they have had in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to one another, is a sure way to discover and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the deceit of lust. <hi>Rahabs</hi> hiding and concealing the spies did much advance their project against Iericho; and so the keeping of the divels counsell, and stifling his temptations, and the deceits of lust, is one of the greatest advantages they can have. Thirdly, receive the Truth with love, for lies and delusions are the doome of those<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 10, 11</note> men who receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the perswasions and suggestions of lust, entertaine no Treatie, have no commerce with it, be not<note place="margin">Psal. 1. 1.</note> in its company alone, let it not draw thee away, sit not in counsell with it. <hi>Qui deliberant desciverunt,</hi> if it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile<note place="margin">Tacit.</note> to get our eare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make us listen unto it, it will
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16278:125"/>
easily proceed further. As soone as ever Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> called, he immediately <hi>refused to conferre with flesh and blood,</hi> which relation elsewhere making, he useth another expression, <hi>Whereupon O King Agrippa I was not disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the heavenly vision;</hi> intimating thus much, that<note place="margin">Act. 16. 19.</note> but to hold a conference with the flesh is a beginning of disobedience. If our first mother <hi>Evah</hi> had observed this rule, not to deliberate, or admit any dispute with the Serpent, but had at first offer rejected his motion, with this peremptorie answere, We have a Law given us, and servants must be rul'd by their master and not by their fellowes, It is fitter to obey God then to dispute against him, to execute his commands then to interpret them, she might have prevented that deluge of sinne and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie which by this one over-sight did invade the world. Therefore the Lord strictly commands his people, that when they were to succeed the nations whom God would cast out before them, and should dwell in their land, they should take heed that they were not snared by following them, neither should they <hi>enquire after their Gods saying. How did these nations serve their Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 12. 30.</note> The very acquanting themselves with the formes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens idolatries might ensnare them. Therefore as soone as lust stirres and offers to perswade thee, start away from it as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did, <hi>Come not nigh the doore of a</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 5. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>strange womans house,</hi> though the first allurements seeme modest and moderate, yet if the Serpent get in but his head, he will easily draw in the rest of his body, and if he should not, yet his sting is in his head.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the promises and threats of lust, first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them not, for lust is a Tempter, and it is given to all Tempters, to be liers too. When God hath said one thing, let no arguments make thee beleeve the contrarie. As we are to beleeve above hope, so above reason too; for though sophistrie may alledge reasons for a false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion which every understanding is not able to answer
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16278:125"/>
or evade, yet there is a voyce of Christ in all saving truth, which his <hi>sheepe are apt to heare</hi> and subscribe unto, in<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 4, 5.</note> which there is an evidence to make it selfe knowne, and to difference delusions from it, though haply a man have not artificiall logick enough to distinguish it from every captious and sophisticall argument. <hi>If an Angell from</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>heaven,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>preach any other Gospell let him be accursed;</hi> we know what it cost the man of God, when he gave credit to the old Prophet of Bethel, though<note place="margin">1. King. 13. 18. 24.</note> pretending an Angels warrant, to goe backe and eate with him, contrary to the commandement which he had received before. Secondly, get security of better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (for all the promises of the flesh if they should bee perform'd will perish with a man) learne to rest upon Gods All-sufficiencie, see thy selfe rich enough in his<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 25.</note> wayes, there are more riches in the persecutions, much more in the promises and performances of God, then in all the treasures of Egypt. Lust can promise nothing but either thou hast it already (and the same water is farre sweeter out of a fountaine, then when it hath passed through a sinke; the same monie farre better when it is a Blessing from God, then when a bribe from Lust; when it is the reward of a service, then when 'tis the price of sinne; when it is given by the Owner, then when depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited by a thiefe) or else thou art farre better without it, thou walkest amongst fewer snares, hast an over-plus of spirituall goods for thy earthly defect, hast thy poverty sweetned and sanctified by better promises; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore respect none of the wages of Lust, consider that God is the <hi>Fountaine of life,</hi> that thou hast <hi>more</hi> and <hi>better</hi> of it in him then in the Creatures, that when thou wantest the things of this life, yet thou hast the <hi>promises</hi> still, and that all the offers of lust are not for comforts, but for snares, not for the use of life, but for the provisions of sin: and there is more content in a little received from God, then in whole treasures stollen from him, and all sinfull

gaine is the robbing of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for the law of lust, setup the law of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life in thy heart. It is a <hi>royall Law,</hi> and a <hi>Law of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> whereas lust is a law of death and bondage; and where the spirit comes, a man shall be set <hi>free from the law of sinne and of death.</hi> Keepe thy selfe alwayes at<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2.</note> home, in the presence of Christ, under the eye and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of thy husband, and that will dash all intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and adulterers out of countenance. Take heed of quenching, grieving, stifling the Spirit, cherish the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, stirre up and kindle the gifts of God in thee, labour by them to grow more in grace, and to have neerer communion with God; the riper the Corne growes, the looser will the chaffe be, and the more a man growes in grace, with the more ease will his corruptions be sever'd and shaken off.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, when lust is violent and importunate: First, be thou importunate and vrgent with God against it too, when the Messenger of Satan, the Thorne in the flesh,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7, 8.</note> did buffet, and sticke fast unto S. <hi>Paul,</hi> hee reiterated his prayers unto God against it, and proportion'd the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of his requests to the violence and urgency of the enemy that troubled him; and he had a comfortable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>My Grace is sufficient for thee,</hi> sufficient in due time to cure, and sufficient at all times to forgive thy weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. In the Law, if a ravisht woman had <hi>cried out,</hi> shee<note place="margin">Deut. 22. 25-27</note> was esteemed innocent, because the pollution was not voluntary, but violent. And so in the assaults of lust, when it useth violence, and pursues the soule that is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to escape and flye from it, if a man with-hold the embraces of his owne will, and cry out against it, if he can say with Saint <hi>Paul, It is no more I that doe it, but sinne</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</note> 
                     <hi>that dwelleth in me,</hi> though in regard that the flesh is something within himselfe, he cannot therefore be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med altogether innocent, yet the Grace of God shall bee sufficient for him. Secondly, when thou art pursued,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16278:126"/>
keepe not Lusts counsell, but seeke remedy from some wise and Christian friend by communicating with him, and disclosing thy case unto him; sinne loves not to bee betrayde or complained on, mutuall confession of sinne,<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 16.</note> to those who will pray for a sinner, and not deride him, or rejoyce against him, is a meanes to heale it. Thirdly, when thou art in a more violent manner then usuall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by sinne, Humble thy selfe in some more peculiar manner before God, and the more sinne cries for satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, denie it and thy selfe the more: as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith of children, so may I say of lusts, <hi>Chastice and subdue thy lusts, and regard not their crying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, cut off the materials and provisions for lust, weane thy selfe from earthly affections; love not the World, nor the things of the World, desire not anything<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 15. Iam. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3, 4. Prov. 30. 8, 9.</note> to consume upon thy lusts, pray for those things which are <hi>convenient for thee,</hi> turne thy heart from those things which are most likely to seduce thee, possesse thy heart with a more spirituall and abiding treasure; hee who lookes stedfastly upon the light of the Sunne, will be able to see nothing below when he lookes downe againe; and surely the more a man is affected with heaven, the lesse will he desire or delight in the world. Besides, the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of sinne are but like full pastures, that doe but fatten,<note place="margin">Hos. 13. 6, 7.</note> and prepare for slaughter. <hi>Balaam</hi> was in very good plight before, able to ride with his <hi>two servants</hi> to attend<note place="margin">Num. 22. 22.</note> him, but greedinesse to rise higher, and make provision for his ambitious heart, carried him upon a wicked busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, made him give cursed counsell against Israel, which at length cost him his owne life.<note place="margin">Num. 31. 8.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, for the instruments of lusts, make a covenant with thy members, keep a government over them, bring them into subjection, above all keepe thy heart, establish<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 27.</note> the inward government; for nothing can be in the body which is not first in the heart; keepe the first mover uniforme and right; all other things which have their
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:16278:127"/>
motions depending there, must needs be right too.</p>
                  <p>Having thus opened at large the life and state of <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne,</hi> it remaines in the last place to shew, how the spirit by the commandement doth convince and discover the life of <hi>actuall sinne:</hi> in omitting so much good, in committing so much evill, in swarving and deviating from the rule in the manner and measure of all our services. And this it doth, by making us see that great spiritualnes and perfection, that precise, universall, and constant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie which the Law requires in all we doe. <hi>Cursed is every one that abideth not in all things that are written</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>in the booke of the Law to doe them. Perfection</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie</hi> of obedience are the two things which the Law requires. Suppose we it possible for a man to fulfill every tittle of the Law in the whole compasse of it, and that for his whole life together, one onely particular, and that the smallest and most imperceptible deviation from it being for one onely time excepted, yet so rigorous and inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the Law, that it seales that man under the wrath and curse of God. The heart cannot turne, the thoughts cannot rise, the affections cannot stirre, the will cannot bend; but the Law meets with it, either as a <hi>Rule</hi> to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or as a <hi>Iudge</hi> to censure it. It penetrates the inmost thoughts, searcheth the bottome of all our actions, hath a widenesse in it which the heart of man cannot endure. <hi>They were not able to endure,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>the things</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 20. Deut. 5. 25. Exod. 34. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>which were commanded;</hi> and <hi>Why tempt you God,</hi> saith Saint'<hi>Peter</hi> to those that preached Circumcision, <hi>and put a yoake upon the brethren, which neither we nor our fathers</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 15. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>were able to beare?</hi> Circumcision it selfe they were able to beare, but that yoke which came with it, namely, the <hi>Debt of the whole Law</hi> was by them and their fathers ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 3.</note> unsupportable. For this very cause was the Law published, that <hi>sinne</hi> might thereby become <hi>exceeding sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> that so Gods grace might bee the more magnified, and his Gospell the more accepted. Let us in a few
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16278:127"/>
words consider some particular aggravations of the life and state of actuall sinne, which the spirit by the Word will present unto us.</p>
                  <p>First, in the <hi>least sinne</hi> that can bee named, there is so much life and venome, as not all the concurrent strength of those millions of Angels, one of whom was in one night able to stay so many thousand men, had been able to remove. More violence and injustice against God in a wandring thought, in an idle word, in an impertinent and unprofitable action, then the worth of the whole Creation, though all the Heavens were turned into one Sunne, and all the earth into one Paradise, were able to expiate. Thinke we as meanely and slightly of it as wee will, swallow it without feare, live in it without sense, commit it without remorse, yet be we assured, that but the guilt of every one of our least sins being upon Christ, who felt nor knew in himselfe nothing of the pollution of them, did wring out those prodigious drops of sweat, did expresse those strong cryes, did poure in those wofull ingredients into the Cup which he dranke, as made him, who had more strength then all the Angels of Heaven, to shrinke and draw backe, and pray against the worke of his owne mercy, and decline the businesse of his owne comming.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the least of my sinnes could doe thus, O what a guilt and filthinesse is there then in the <hi>greatest sinne</hi> which my life hath been defiled withall? If my Atomes be Mountaines, O what heart is able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the vastnesse of my mountainous sinnes? if there bee so much life in my <hi>impertinent</hi> thoughts, how much rage and fury is there in my <hi>rebellious</hi> thoughts? In my thoughts of gall and bitternesse, in my contrived mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in my speculative adulteries, in my impatient mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, in my ambitious projections, in my coverous, worldly, froward, haughty, hatefull imaginations, in my contempt of God, reproching of his Word, smothering
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:16278:128"/>
of his motions, quenching of his spirit, rebelling against his grace? If every vaine word be a flame that can kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the fire of Hell about mine eares, O what vollies of brimstone, what mountaines of wrath will be darted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my wretched soule, for tearing the glorious and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name of the great God with my cursed oathes, my crimson and fiery execrations? What will become of sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>king, dirty, carrion communication, of lies and scornes, and railings and bitternesse, the persecutions, adulteries, and murthers of the tongue, when but the idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and unprofitablenesse of the tongue is not able to endure this consuming fire?</p>
                  <p>3. If one great sin, nay one small sin be so full of life, as not all the strength, nay not all the deaths or annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all the Angels in heaven could have expiated, O how shall I stand before an <hi>army of sinnes?</hi> So many, which I know of my selfe, swarmes of thoughts, steames of lusts, throngs of sinfull words, sands of evill actions, every one as heavie and as great as a mountaine, able to take up if they were put into bodies all the vast <hi>chasm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> betweene earth and heaven, and fill all the spaces of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with darkenesse and confusion? and how infinite more secret ones are there, which I know not by my selfe? How many Atomes and streames of dust doth a beame of the Sunne shining into a roome discover, which by any other light was before imperceptible? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sinfull secrers are there in my heart, which though the light of mine owne conscience cannot discover, are yet written in Gods account, and sealed amongst his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and shall at the day of the revelation of all things bee produc'd and muster'd up against me, like so many Lyons and Divels to flye upon me?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the number of them can thus amaze, O what shall the <hi>roote</hi> of them doe? Committed out of <hi>ignorance</hi> in the midst of light; out of <hi>knowledge</hi> against the evidence of conscience; out of presumption and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalling
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16278:128"/>
of pardon, abusing and subordinating the mercies of God to the purposes of Satan, not knowing that his goodnesse should have led me to repentance; out of <hi>stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse</hi> against the discipline, out of <hi>enmitie</hi> against the goodnesse, out of gall and <hi>bitternesse</hi> of spirit against the power and purity of Gods holy Law?</p>

See how notably Saint <hi>Austen</hi> aggravates his sinne of robbing an Orchard when he was a Boy, that which others lesse acquainted with the foulenesse of sinne might be apt enough but to laugh over. First, it began in the will, and the members follow'd, I had a minde, and therefore I did it. Secondly, I did not doe it for want of the things, but out of the naughtinesse of my heart, and my inward enmitie to righteousnesse. Thirdly, I did it not with any aime at fruition of the fruite, but onely of the sinne; it was not my palate, but my lust which I studied to satisfie. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the apples I stole were very unapt to tempt, no rellish, no forme in them to catch the eye, or allure the hand, but the whole temptation and rise of the sinne was from within. Fifthly, I did it not alone, there were a troope of naughty companions with mee, and wee did mutually cherish and provoke the itch of each others lust. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was at a very unseasonable time of night, when at least for that day we should have put a period and given a respite unto our lusts. Seventhly, it was after wee had spent much time before (and should now at least have been tired out) in pestilent and foolish sports. Eighthly, wee were immodest in our theft, we carried away great loades and burdens of them. Ninthly, when wee had done, we feasted the Hogs with them, and our selves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ed upon the review and carriage of our owne lewdnesse. Lastly, the chiefe sport and laughter which wee had was this, that we had not only robb'd, but deceiv'd the honest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>en, who had never so bad an opinion of us, as that wee
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16278:129"/>
should doe it; and thus another mans losse was our jest. And after all this, his meditations upon it are excellent; with <hi>David</hi> hee goes to the roote, <hi>Ecce cor meum Deus meus, ecce cor meum.</hi> O Lord, what a nature and heart had I, that could commit sinne without any <hi>

Lord, I will love thee, I will prayse thee, I will confesse to thy Name, it is thy Grace which pardoneth the sinnes which I have committed, and it is thy Grace which prevented the sinnes which I have not committed: Thou hast saved me from all sinnes, those which by mine owne will I have done, and those which by thy Grace I have been kept from doing. If every man would single out some nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinnes of his life, and in this manner anatomize them, and see how many sinnes one sinne containeth, even as one flower many leaves, and one Pomegranate many kernels, it could not but be a notable meanes of humbling us for sinne.</p>

                     </gap>ine, and not withstanding all the raine which fell upon me, continued barren still.

atheisme, and profanenesse, but he hath cast my lot in a beautifull place, and given me a goodly heritage, and now hee requires nothing of me but to doe justly, and worke righteousnesse, and walke humbly before God, and I requite evill for good to the hurt of mine owne soule.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, the <hi>manner</hi> of committing these sinnesis is full of life too. Peradventure they are <hi>Kings,</hi> have a court and regiment in my heart, at best they will be <hi>Tyrants</hi> in mee, they have been committed with much strength, power, service, attendance, with obstinacy, frowardnesse, perseverance, without such sense, sorrow, or apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as things of so great a guiltinesse did require.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, in good duties whereas grace should bee ever quick and operative, make us conformable to our head, walke worthy of our high calling, and as becommeth godlinesse, as men that have learned and received Christ, how much unprofitablenesse, unspiritualnesse, distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, formality, want of rellish, failings, intermissions, deadnesse, uncomfortablenesse do shew themselves? How much flesh with spirit, how much wantonnesse with grace, how much of the world with the word, how much of the weeke in the Sabbath, how much of the bag or barne in the Temple? how much superstition with the worship? how wuch security with the feare? how much vaine-glory in the honour of God? in one word, How much of my selfe, and therefore how much of my sinne, in all my services and duties which I performe? These and a world the like aggravations serve to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the life of actuall sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I at large opened the first of the three things proposed, namely, that the spirit by opening the Rule doth convince men that they are in the state of sin, both originall and actuall.</p>
                  <p>The next thing proposed was to shew <hi>what kinde of condition or estate the state of sinne is.</hi> And here are two
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16278:130"/>
things principally remarkeable: first it is an estate of most <hi>extreme impotency</hi> and disability unto any good: Secondly, of most <hi>extreme enmity</hi> against the holinesse and wayes of God.</p>
                  <p>First it is an estate of <hi>impotency</hi> and Disability to any good, <hi>Paul</hi> in his pharisaicall condition thought himselfe able to live without blame, Phil. 3. 6. But when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement came he found all his former moralities to have been but dung. Our naturall estate is <hi>without any strength,</hi> Rom. 5. 6. so weake that it makes <hi>the Law it selfe weake,</hi> Rom. 8. 3. as unable to doe the workes of a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, as a dead man of a naturall life, for wee are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Dead in sinne.</hi> Eph. 2. 1. and <hi>held under by it,</hi> Rom. 7. 6. And this is a wofull aggravation of the state of sinne, that a man lies in mischiefe (1. Ioh. 5. 19.) as a carkasse in rottennesse and dishonour, without any power to deliver himselfe. He that raised up <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of his grave, must by his owne voyce raise up us from sinne, <hi>The dead shall heare the voyce of the Sonne of man, and they that heare shall live.</hi> Ioh. 5. 25. All men are by nature <hi>strangers</hi> to the life of God, Eph. 4. 18. and <hi>sorreiners</hi> from his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Eph. 2. 19. Able without him to doe <hi>Nothing,</hi> no more then a branch is to beare any fruit, when it is cut of from the fellowship of the roote which should quicken it, Ioh. 15. 4. 5. <hi>In me,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>that is, in my flesh there dwelleth no good thing.</hi> Rom. 7. 18. a man is as una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to breake through the debt of the Law, or his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to death and bondage, as a beast to shake of his yoke. Act. 15. 10. or a dead man his funerall clothes. Ioh. 11. 44. In one word, so great is this impotencie which is in us by sinne, that we are not sufficient <hi>to thinke a good thing.</hi> 2. Cor. 3. 5. not able <hi>to understand a good thing,</hi> nor to comprehend the light when it shines upon us. 1. Cor. 2. 14. Ioh. 1. 5. Our tongues unable to speake a good word, <hi>How can yee being evill speake good things.</hi> Matth. 12. 34. Our eares unable to heare a good word, <hi>To whom</hi>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:16278:131"/>
                     <hi>shall I speake and give warning that they may heare, behold their eare is uncircumcised and they cannot hearken.</hi> Ier. 6. 10. our whole man unable to obey, the <hi>carnall minde is not subiect to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Rom. 8. 7.</p>
                  <p>The Reasons hereof are these. First, <hi>Our universall both naturall and personall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> wee are by nature all flesh, children of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> Ioh. 3. 6. Children of Gods wrath. Eph. 2. 3. and so long it is impossible wee should doe any thing to please God, for they that are in the flesh <hi>cannot please God.</hi> Rom. 8. 8. a man must first be <hi>renewed in his mind,</hi> before he can so much as make proof of what will be acceptable unto God. Rom. 12. 2. This naturall Impurity in our persons is the ground of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity in our workes, for <hi>unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> every thing is uncleane,</hi> Tit. 1. 15. and all the fruit of an evill Tree is evill fruit. Math. 7. 18. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives the reason of it, Because our fruit should be fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>itunto God, Rom. 7. 4. and fruit unto holinesse. Rom 6. 22. Whereas these works of naturall men doe neither begin in God, nor looke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, nor tend unto him, God is neither the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, nor the object, nor the end of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Our naturall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ie,</hi> the best performance of wicked men is but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Gift of an enemie, and the sacrifice of fooles. It proceedeth not from <hi>love</hi> which is the <hi>Bond of perfection,</hi> that which keepeth all other requisite ingredients of a good worke together, Col. 3. 14. which is the <hi>fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13. 8. and the principle of obedience, and all willing service and conformity to God, Gal. 5. 6. Ioh. 14. 15. and ever procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the spirit of Christ, Gal. 5. 22. for by nature we are enemies, Rom. 5. 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Our naturall infidelity,</hi> for the state of sinne is an estate of unbeliefe, The spirit shall convince the world of sinne, because they beleeve not. Ioh. 16. 9. Now infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity doth utterly disable men to please God, without
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16278:131"/>
faith it is impossible to please him. Heb. 11. 6. <hi>There can no good worke be done but in Christ;</hi> we are <hi>sanctified in Christ,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. 2. we are <hi>created in Christ unto good works,</hi> Eph. 2. 10. we must be <hi>one with him before wee can be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi> Heb. 2. 11. and this is the reason why faith sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and purifies the heart, Act. 15. 9. and by consequence the whole man (for when the fountaine was clensed all the waters were sweete. 2. Reg. 2. 21.) because faith is the bond which fastens us unto Christ. Eph. 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Our naturall ignorance and follie.</hi> For the state of sinne is ever an ignorant estate. <hi>Evill men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not judgement.</hi> Prov. 28. 5. The usuall stile that the Scripture gives sinners, even the best of sinners, those who keepe themselves <hi>Virgins,</hi> and <hi>escape many of the pollutions of the world,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speakes, 2. Pet. 2. 20. is <hi>fooles</hi> Math. 25. 2. though they know many things, yet they <hi>know nothing as they ought to know.</hi> 1. Cor. 8. 2. Now the roote of our well pleasing is <hi>wisedome and spirituall knowledge,</hi> Col. 1. 9. 10. that is it which makes us walke worthy of the Lord, and fruitfull in good works. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as want of understanding is that which makes us altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unprofitable, that wee doe no good. Rom. 3. 11. 12.</p>
                  <p>And now what a cutting consideration should this be to a man to consider, God made me for his use, that I should be his servant to doe his will, and I am utterly unfit for any services save those which dishonour him, like the wood of the vine, utterly unusefull and unmeete for any worke? Ezek. 15. 4. what then should I expect but to be cast out, as a vessell in which is no pleasure? If I am altogether barr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n, and of no use, what a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full patience of God is it that suffers mee to cumber the ground, and doth not presently cast me into the fire? that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> me like a noisome weed to poison the aire, and choake the growth of better things? If I drinke in the raine, and bring forth nothing but thornes, how neere
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16278:132"/>
must I needs be unto cursing? And this conviction should make men labour to have place in Christ, because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they shall bee enabled to please God, and in some measure to bring that glory to him for which they were made. For this is a thing which God much delights in, when a creature doth <hi>glorifie him actively,</hi> by living unto him. He will not loose his glory by any Creature, but fetch it out at the last, but when the Creature operates out of it selfe to Gods end, and carries Gods intention through its owne worke, then is hee most honored and delighted. <hi>Herein,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>is my Father glorified, that ye beare much fruit,</hi> Ioh. 15. 8. and herein did Christ <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his father in finishing the worke which he gave him to do.</hi> Ioh. 17 4. What an encouragement should this bee for those who have hitherto liv'd in the lusts of the flesh, to come over to Christ and his righteousnesse; and for others to goe on with patience through all difficulties, because in so doing they worke to that end for which they were made, they live to God, and bring forth fruit unto him, who hath in much patience spared and in infinite love called them to himselfe? How should we praise God that hath given us any strength in any way to doe him ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? that is pleas'd to account himselfe honoured when he is obeyed by us, who spoile all the works we do with our owne corruptions? And how should we husband all the pretious moments of our life to the advantage of our master, whose very acceptation of such unworthy servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should alone bee both encouragement and reward enough unto us? The more profitably any man lives, the more comfortably he shall die.</p>
                  <p>Now to consider more particularly this <hi>disabilitie</hi> which comes along with sinne, we may note, that it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>totall,</hi> when a man is <hi>all flesh,</hi> as by nature we are; or at best <hi>partiall,</hi> in proportion to the vigor of concupif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and life of sinne in the best of us. To touch a little upon both of these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:16278:132"/>First, in a wicked man, who is totally in the state of sinne, there is a <hi>Totall and absolute impossibility and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> to doe any thing that is good. <hi>Every figment and motion of the heart of man is onely and continually evill.</hi> Gen. 6. 5. But though his heart be evill, may not his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or his words be good? No, for that is the fountaine whence all they issue, and impossible it is that sweete water should proceed from a bitter and corrupted foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, Matth. 12. 34. Iam. 3. 11. Looke on the best acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wicked men. If they pray to God, their <hi>prayer is an abomination,</hi> Prov. 28. 9. If they sacrifice, <hi>God will not accept nor smell,</hi> nor regard any of their offerings he will esteeme them all <hi>abominable and uncleane, as a dogs head, or swines bloud,</hi> Amos 5. 21. Esai. 66. 3. Seeme things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so specious in the sight of men that doe them, yet in his sight they may be uncleane, Hag. 2. 13, 14. If they turne, and enquire and seeke early after God, all this is not fidelity but only flatterie, Psal. 78. 34. 37. Like the spicing and embalming of a carkasse, which can never put so much beauty or value into it, as to make it a welcome present unto a Prince.</p>
                  <p>But what then? Can a wicked man doe nothing but sinne? when he gives Almes, builds Churches, reades the Scripture, heares the Word, worships God, are these all sinnes? if so, then he ought to forbeare them, and leave them utterly undone. Here are <hi>Two Points</hi> in this case, First, to consider <hi>How all the workes of naturall men may be esteem'd sinfull;</hi> and secondly, this being granted that they are sinfull, <hi>How they ought to carry themselves in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of doing or omitting of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the former of these, we are first to premise these notes. First, a worke done may bee <hi>Sub duplici genere Boni,</hi> it may be measured by Two sorts of Goodnesse; first there is <hi>Goodnesse ethicall or morall,</hi> in relation unto manners, and in order unto men; and secondly, there is <hi>Goodnesse theologicall or divine,</hi> in relation to Religion,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:16278:133"/>
and in order unto God. A thing is <hi>morally Good,</hi> when it is Good in the sight of men, good unto humane pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, good by way of Example, or by way of Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Quamvis viden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the course of the places and times which a man lives in. Such were Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> services before his Conversion, which therefore he esteemed but dung, and suffered the losse of them, for a man may do good things, and yet when he hath done lose them all, 2. Ioh. vers. 8. Nay they may be done <hi>profanely,</hi> as <hi>Balaams</hi> blessing of Israel, and the false brethrens preaching, out of envy and ill will. Phil. 1. 15. 16.

                  <p>Thirdly, we are to note That some things are <hi>so essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially Good</hi> in themselves, as that they cannot be done, but they must bee well and spiritually done; such are those things which take in God into their very perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and doe intrinsecally and in the substance of the worke respect him.

Such were <hi>Iehu</hi> his zeale, the Pharises praying, the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites fasting, and the like. In one word, somethings are so inherently Good, that though they may be done imperfectly, yet they cannot be do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>First, then it must have a <hi>new principle,</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of the Spirit of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the Conscience from dead workes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the manner, it must bee done with the affection of a childe, not out of bondage, but in love, 2. Tim. 1. 7. In voluntary service and resignation of all the members unto righteousnesse. Rom. 6. 19. In universall respect to all the Commandements, Psal. 119. 128. In obedience to God the Law-giver, for he never obeyes the Law even when he doth the workes therein contained, but when hee doth it with all submissiue and loyall affections towards him that commands it. Iam. 2. 10, 11. this onely is to live unto God, and to bring forth fruite unto him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it must be directed unto holy ends; and those

are principally foure, to which others are to be subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,<note place="margin">Aug. de morib. Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

First, <hi>the glory of God,</hi> we must bring forth fruit, and finish our workes, and doe all that we have to doe with respect unto his glory, Ioh. 15. 8. Ioh 17. 4. 1. Cor. 10. 31. Secondly, the <hi>Edification, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, comfort</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that nothing redound to their offence, but to their profit and salvation, 1. Cor. 10. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, 33. Col. 1. 24. 2. Tim. 2. 10. 2. Cor. 1. 6. Thirdly, the <hi>Credit,</hi> honour, and passage of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> that it may be furthered, and not evill spoken of, 2. Cor. 6. 3, 4. 1. Cor. 9. 19. 23. Phil. 1. 12. Fourthly, <hi>a mans owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> that he be not after all his paines a cast-away, but that he may save himselfe. 1. Cor. 9. 27. 1. Tim. 4. 16. 1. Pet. 1. 9.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>all the meanes</hi> unto that end must be <hi>regular</hi> and sutable, Evill must not be done to bring good about, Rom. 3. 8. and all the circumstances which accompany the action must be right too. For as in the body there is not onely requir'd beauty, but order and proportion; Let the face be of never so delicate and choice complection, yet if any part be mis-plac'd it will cause a notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie and uncomelinesse to it: so in duties, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent worke may be so mis-plac'd, or mis-tim'd, or atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with such incongruous and unsutable circumstances, as that it may prove rather a snare of Satan, then a fruit of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, to make it completely acceptable, It must passe through the <hi>Incense</hi> and <hi>Intercession of Christ,</hi> who as he doth by his <hi>Merits</hi> take away the <hi>Guilt</hi> of sinne from our persons; so by his <hi>Intercession</hi> he hideth the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and adherencie of sinne that is in our services, and so giveth us accesse, and maketh all our duties <hi>acceptable</hi> by him to God. Ephes. 2. 18. 1. Pet. 2. 5. <hi>He hath made us</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 1. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>to be priests unto God, and our Prayers, and good workes, as spirituall sacrifices come up before God.</hi> But it is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that there be a <hi>Priest,</hi> and an <hi>offering,</hi> except there
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16278:135"/>
be an <hi>Altar</hi> too upon which to offer it (for it is the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> which sanctifieth the <hi>offering</hi>) Now <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 23 19.</note> which sanctifieth all our spirituall <hi>sacrifices, Their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices shall be accepted upon mine Altar, and they shall come up with acceptance on mine Altar,</hi> Esai. 56. 7. 60. 7.</p>
                  <p>These things being thus premised, we conclude, first, A wicked man cannot doe those things at all which are so essentially and inherently good, as that the very <hi>op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Secondly, every thing that is spirituall is vitall, for the spirit quickneth; the spirit of Holinesse never comes but with a Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Rom. 1. 4. Ro. 8. 10, 11. 2. Cor. 3. 6. and therefore he is called the spirit of life, Rom. 8. 2. but now as the persons of wicked men, so their workes are all dead, Heb. 9 14. and therfore not being done <hi>spiritually</hi> &amp; <hi>obedientially,</hi> impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

it is that they should in any sense please God, Rom. 8. 8. whose pure eyes can endure nothing which beareth not, in some, though most remote degree, proportion to his most holy nature, 2. Pet. 1. 4. But it may be objected, doth God use to doe good to those that hate him, and that even for the things which himselfe hateth in them? doth not that worke please him, which he is pleased to reward? and we finde the workes of wicked men in the Scripture rewarded. <hi>Ahab</hi> humbled himselfe before<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>To this I answere, that this God doth not to iustifie or allow wicked mens actions, when they are in shew conformable to his Will; but first to shew that his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is over all his workes, when he is pleased to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the actions which hee might iustly punish: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to shew that God will never be upbraided, for<note place="margin">Esai. 58. 3.

Wicked men are apt to twit God with the unprofitablenesse of his service, and the unequalnesse of his wayes, to boast that their worke hath beene more then their wages; and therefore utterly to stop their mouthes, when he shall proceede in iudgement with them, he gives them such rewards as are most sutable to their owne desires (the <hi>hypocrites</hi> pray<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 2. 5.</note> and give almes to bee seene of men, and that reward which they desired they have) and such as are most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their services: As they bring him <hi>uncleane ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi> so he rendereth unto them <hi>unsanctified rewards;</hi> as the give him services full of hypocrisie which doe not please him, so he gives them benefits full of bitternesse

Fourthly, to intice and incourage wicked men unto sincere obedience; for thus may they recount with themselves: If God thus reward my <hi>uncleane,</hi> how aboundantly would he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence my <hi>spirituall services?</hi> If he let fall such crums unto dogges, how aboundantly would hee provide for me if I were his Childe? If the blessings of his left hand <hi>riches and glorie</hi> bee so excellent even to the Goates, how pretious would the blessings of his right hand, <hi>length of dayes,</hi> and <hi>eternall happinesse</hi> be if I were one of his sheepe? So then it is not <hi>Ex pretio operis,</hi> but only <hi>Ex largitate donantis;</hi> The reward is not out of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue or price of the worke, but out of the bountie of God, who will not leave himselfe without a witnesse, but as a master for incouragement and allurements sake will reward the industrie of an ignorant scholler, though hee blot and deface all that he puts his hand unto; so God to overcome men by his goodnesse and bounty, and to draw them to repentance, is pleased to reward the workes which he might iustly punish.</p>
                  <p>But have not the wicked some measures and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit given them, by which they are enabled to do those workes they doe? Heb. 6. 4. 1. Cor. 12 6. 7. And is not that a good worke which proceedeth from the supplies of the Spirit of God? To this wee answere, First, as it is the influence of the same Sunne, which ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth both the Grape, and the Crabbe, and yet though the Grape have sweetenesse from the Sunne, the Crabbe still retaines the sowrenesse which it hath from its selfe: so it is the same spirit which helpeth the faithfull in their holy, and the wicked in their morall workes, which yet
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16278:137"/>
still retaine the qualitie and sowrnesse of the stocke from whence they come. Secondly, we deny them not to bee good <hi>in Suo genere,</hi> that is, <hi>morally,</hi> and in the sight of men; but yet they are not good in Gods sight, so as to procure <hi>acceptance</hi> with him; for which purpose wee must note, That God gives severall proportions of his Spirit, and for severall purposes. To some the Spirit to <hi>sanctifie</hi> and <hi>renew,</hi> Rom. 1. 4. Tit. 3. 5. To others the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to <hi>edifie</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> withall, 1. Cor. 12. 7. To some <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi> and to others <hi>gifts,</hi> 1. Cor. 14. 1. To some as <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> that they may walke profitably before men, as <hi>Cirus</hi> was annointed for <hi>Iacobs</hi> sake, Esai. 45. 1, 4. To others as <hi>Sonnes</hi> and <hi>Members,</hi> that they may walke <hi>acceptablie</hi> before him, 1. Pet. 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>But then comes the second <hi>Case</hi> proposed, if a wicked man can doe nothing but evill, then it seemes hee ought to leave undone all his <hi>Almes, Prayers, Fastings,</hi> and <hi>Religions services,</hi> because we are to abstaine from every thing which is polluted with sinne; and that which God will not see, man must not doe. To this I answere <hi>No,</hi> by <hi>no meanes.</hi> The poore man at the poole of <hi>Bethesda,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 7.</note> though utterly impotent and unable to crawle in when the <hi>Angell</hi> came to stirre the waters, did not yet neglect what lay in his power to waite at the place, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour his owne cure; <hi>Naturall impotency</hi> can give no excuse to wilfull neglect. When <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was in the gall of bitternesse, yet Saint <hi>Peter</hi> directed him then<note place="margin">Act. 8. 22, 23.</note> to pray. Here then these two Rules must regulate this Case. First, a wicked mans necessity of sinning must not nullifie the Law of God, which requires the doing of those things, though not with such an uncleane heart as he doth them. The impotency of man must not either prejudice Gods Authoritie, or diminish his owne dutie. As, though <hi>where sinne abounds Grace doth more abound, yet a man must not sinne that grace may abound;</hi> so, though when a wicked man doth the things of the Law, he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16278:137"/>
yet he must not omit the duty, upon pretence to escape the sinne. Secondly, when a thing is evill <hi>Propter fieri,</hi> because it is done, the doing of that thing is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and inti insecally sinfull, and therefore to be avoided; but when a thing done is evill, not because it is done, but because something which should make the doing of it good and acceptable is omitted, and so it is evill not in the substance of thing, but by reason of the defects which cleave unto it, here this ought stiil to be done, but the other ought not to bee left undone. <hi>Iehu</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded<note place="margin">2. King 10. 30.</note> to destroy the house of <hi>Ahab,</hi> he did so, and thus farre he did well; but his ends and Gods divide the same Action, God out of Iustice, he out of policie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he esteemed it zeale, yet God accompted it murther and shedding of bloud, and though as it was in substance the thing which God commanded, he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it, yet as the execution thereof was otherwise then he required, so he threatneth to revenge it: <hi>I will avenge</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 1. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>the bloud of Iezreel upon the house of Iehu.</hi> What then, is <hi>Iehu</hi> to commit murther? <hi>God forbid:</hi> and yet is he to doe that, in doing whereof he did commit murther? yes, for God requir'd it. So then he was to performe Gods Command, but he was not thereby to worke out his owne projects, God commanded him to execute his justice, but not his owne revenge. When the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> foretold the captivity of the Iewes, if hee had preached judgement with such an affection as <hi>Iehu</hi> did execute it, with aimes at his owne credit in the truth of his message, with delight in the ruine and desolation of the Church, with expectation and desire to see the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable accomplishment of his owne preaching (as<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ona 4. 1, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Ionah</hi> did at Ninive) though hee had done that which God required, yet had he greatly finned in corrupting his message with his owne lust: but herein was the faithfulnesse of that holy man seene, that though he did proclayme the woefull day, yet he did not desire it, but
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16278:138"/>
said <hi>Amen</hi> to the words of those false prophets, that<note place="margin">Ier. 17. 16. 28. 6.</note> preached peace and restitution againe. So then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this <hi>Case,</hi> when an <hi>Action</hi> hath evill in its owne <hi>substance,</hi> it is to be omitted, but when the <hi>Action</hi> is of it selfe the <hi>matter</hi> of a precept, and so hath evill onely externally cast upon it by the <hi>Agent</hi> that doth it, here the <hi>Action</hi> is not to be <hi>omitted,</hi> but the <hi>Agent</hi> is to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will say, If I may not doe evill that good may come of it, then I may not doe good when evill will come of it, upon the same reason, because evill is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to be prevented and avoided. To this I answer, that the Argument followes cleane contrary, I may not doe evill though good would come of it, I must doe good though evill should come of it. For when a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is absolute and peremptorie, we must not observe it with respect to consequences, nor foist in conditions or relations of our owne to over-rule the duety, lest wee make our selves Lords of the Law. Now the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for doing Good, notwithstanding any conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which may attend it, is as absolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory, as the command for not doing evill, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must not observe or forbeare it with respect unto any consequences. For God will have us to measure our dutie by his command, which requires to abstaine from evill, and to doe good, not by the Events that are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall and externall to the dutie done. So then that which is good materially of it selfe is to be done though evill follow, first, because God requires it, and his will must stand against all consequences. Secondly, because the evill that comes along in the doing of it is not any way belonging or naturally appendant upon the dutie, but is foisted into it by our wicked nature, and the wickednesse of man must not either annihilate the commands of God, or voide and evacuate his owne dutie, or lastly justifie or priviledge his presumptions. Thirdly, because so to doe
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16278:138"/>
is not to prevent evill, but to multiply it, not to escape sin, but to double it. We must observe Gods way of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of sinne, and not our owne; It was never knowne that one sinne was the way to prevent or to cure ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Besides there is lesse sinfulnesse in a defect which attendeth a duety done, then in a totall omission of it; for that comes in by way of consequence, the other is against the very substance and whole bodie of the command; that proceedeth from naturall and unavoidable impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, this from a wilfulnesse which might have beene prevented.</p>
                  <p>Now since the wicked haue such a <hi>totall disabilitie,</hi> as that what ever they doe is altogether sinfull, hath not a dramme of holynesse in it, the principles, the ends, the wayes all <hi>Carnall;</hi> Heere then wee might observe the foulnesse of those reliques of <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> in doctrine of the <hi>Papists,</hi> who flatter and complie with nature against the grace of <hi>Christ,</hi> in their doctrines of merit of congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie and preparations for grace, the acceptablenesse of heathen vertues in the sight of God, the infallible atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Grace upon naturall endeauours, as if things <hi>totally evill,</hi> and deserving wrath, could prepare for <hi>Grace.</hi> But I rather choose to speake to the Conscience, It should serve therefore to amaze naturall men in the sight of this <hi>state</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> and to throw them downe under Gods mighty hand, when they shall consider that their best workes are <hi>totally</hi> evill, that doe what they will it is altogether abominable in Gods sight. What a wofull thing is it for a man to be debtor to the whole <hi>Law,</hi> one iot or title whereof shall not passe away, and to bee ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unable to doe any thing which beareth proportion to the least title of that <hi>Law,</hi> because the <hi>Law</hi> is all over spirituall, and he all over Carnall. It would be an Insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable burden to perish everlastingly for but <hi>one sinne:</hi> how infinitely more to be answerable for all those infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite trespasses, not one whereof can bee remitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16278:139"/>
all. This one point of the <hi>Disabilitie of Nature</hi> to please God in any thing, if it were duly considered, would compell men to goe unto <hi>Christ,</hi> by whom they may have accesse, and for whom their services shall have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance before God, till which time they are all but dung<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God will throw them in the faces of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: And the reason is, till a man takes Christ by faith along with him, these sacrifices have no golden <hi>Censer</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amos 5. 21, 22.</note> to perfume them, no <hi>Altar</hi> to sanctifie them, nothing but a mans owne evill heart to Consecrate them upon; which makes them to be <hi>our owne,</hi> and not Gods offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. When the Prodigall came unto himselfe, and considered, I have nothing, I can doe nothing, all that I eate is dirt and filth, I am an unprofitable creature in this state; these thoughts made him resolue to goe unto his father. When <hi>Saint Paul</hi> considered that what<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 13. Phil. 3. 6, 7, 8.</note> ever before his conversion hee thought of himselfe, yet indeede all his zeale was but blasphemie and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all his moralitie but dung and dogs meate, all his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameablenesse &amp; presumptions but losse unto him, then he began to set an infinite value upon the excellencie of the knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> and to suffer the losse of all, that he might be found in him. Sinne must be very sinnefull, that <hi>Grace</hi> may be very welcome.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this <hi>Impotencie</hi> and <hi>Disabilitie</hi> is <hi>Partiall,</hi> even in the most <hi>Regenerate;</hi> so much flesh as they have in them, so much deadnesse and unserviceablenesse still; and this may bee seene in two points. First, there is a <hi>great disabilitie</hi> in the best to worke and goe on with patience and comfort in Gods service. How apt are we still to quench and grieve the Spirit? How doth every mans experience constraine him to crie out, <hi>In mee dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no good thing, to will is present with mee, but I cannot performe the things which I would, Lord I beleeve, helpe thou mine unbeleefe?</hi> How doe we faint and waxe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of well-doing? How are wee led captive to the law
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16278:139"/>
of sinne which is in our members, <hi>so that wee cannot doe</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17. 1. Cor. 2. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>the things which we would?</hi> for though the <hi>Scripture</hi> call the <hi>Saints perfect,</hi> and testifie of some that they served God with their whole heart, yet that is onely in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to <hi>Corde duplici,</hi> a double heart, denoting such an integrity onely as doth not admit a purposed division of the heart betweene God and sinne. Therefore wee meete still with exhortations to grow, and abound, and with promises of bringing forth more fruite, and menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of proceeding from faith to faith, and from glory to glory, and of supplies of the spirit, and growing to the measure of the stature of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the like expressions, all which denote the admixture of <hi>Impotencie</hi> in the best. And this <hi>Impotencie</hi> is so great, that of themselves they can never doe any thing, but returne to their wonted coldnesse and dulnesse againe: for it is nor their having <hi>of Grace</hi> in them barely which makes them <hi>strong,</hi> but their <hi>Communion</hi> and fellowship with <hi>Christs fulnesse, I am able to doe all things through Christ that strengthens me.</hi> The branch can beare no fruite, nor preserve or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that which it hath, but by its unity with the roote; light continues not in the house but by its dependance on the Sunne, shut out that, all the light is presently gone. Take water away from the fire and its nature will be presently stronger then the heate it borrowed, and suddenly reduce it to its wonted coldnesse: So wee can doe nothing but by the constant supplies of the <hi>Spirit of Christ;</hi> he that begins must finish every good worke in vs, Phil. 1. 6. <hi>He that is the Author must be the finisher of our faith too,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. <hi>Without him we cannot will nor doe any good,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. <hi>Without him, when we have done both, we cannot continue, but shall faint in the way, His Spirit must lead us,</hi> Rom. 8. 14. Esai. 40. 11. <hi>His arme must heale and strengthen us,</hi> Hos. 11. 3. Ezek. 34. 16. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> we have received him, so we must walks in him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him wee cannot walke,</hi> Col. 2. 6. <hi>God is the God of All</hi>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:16278:140"/>
                     <hi>Grace, to him it bolongeth not onely to call, but to perfect, not onely to perfect, but to strengthen, stablish, settle us,</hi> 1. Pet. 5. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this <hi>Impotencie</hi> is seene in this, that the good things they doe cannot fully please God by themselves, but stand in neede of further purification from Christ, and pardon from God; Even when wee are Children we must be spared, and borne withall, Mal. 3. 17. Deut. 1. 31.</p>
                  <p>The use which we should make of this point is first to keepe us <hi>Humble,</hi> in regard of this thorne in our flesh, which disables us to doe any good, and when wee have done our uttermost, yet still makes us unprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Lay together these considerations.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>remember</hi> the long time that thou wert utterly barren, and didst live nothing but a life of sinne, how much of the flowre of thine age hath bin dedicated unto Satan, and thine owne lusts; how thy childhood &amp; youth hath beene all vanity; and why thinke we did God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the first fruits in the Law, but to shew that wee were all his, and therefore that he ought to have the first and best of our life devoted unto him, and submitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his yoke.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>consider</hi> even now when thou art at best that thou art not sufficient of thy selfe to thinke a good thought, that in thee, that is in thy flesh, in thee from thy selfe dwelleth no good thing, the originall of all the good thou dost is without thee, <hi>By the Grace of God thou art what thou art, and all thy sufficiency is in his Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when this <hi>Grace</hi> doth call, knocke, quicken, put thee onto any good, how averse and froward, how dull, indirigible, undocile is thy evill heart, like a filly Lambe, never findes the way it selfe; and when it is led, is every step ready to stoppe and to start aside.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when it <hi>prevailes</hi> to set thee indeede a worke, how exceedingly dost thou faile in the measure
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:16278:140"/>
of thy duties? How little growth in strength? How litle improvement in spirituall knowledge or experience? How much wearinesse and revolting of heart? How evill and unprofitable hath thy life beene in comparison of those worthies whom thou shouldest have followed, and in proportion to those meanes of grace which thou hast had?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in thy <hi>progresse,</hi> How often hast thou stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled? How many notorious and visible sinnes, even in great Characters, have oftentimes stained if not thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession by a publike scandall, yet thy soule in private by a consciousnesse unto them? And how thinke wee did <hi>Davids</hi> murther and adultery pull downe the pride of his heart when ever it offered to rise in any Heavenly action?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in this point it will bee needefull to give direction in a case of dayly occurrence, what a man should doe when he findes his naturall impotencie dead him in Spirituall workes? when he findes stupiditie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbdnesse of spirit, and many defects, which hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overrule nor subdue in Gods service; whether it were not better to for beare the very dutie, then to grieve the spirit with undue performances? To this I answere. First, omit not the dutie though thou art never so ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, for that is to give place to the Divell, and to yeeld to the flesh, and the Divell is pleased either way; when by his allurements he can perswade us to evill, and when by discomforts hee can discourage us from good. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides by doing spirituall things a man growes more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and gathers strength even in the action; as water which comes hard at first flowes very plentifully after it hath beene a little drawne. They that beginne in teares may end in ioy: <hi>David</hi> began to pray with no comfort, much sore vexation and weakenesse of spirit under the sense of Gods heavie displeasure, and yet hee ends with much faith, peace, and triumph. <hi>The Lord hath heard</hi>

                     <hi>my supplication, the Lord will receive my prayer; Let all mine enemies be ashamed, &amp;c.</hi> Psal. 6. 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, take <hi>Saint Pauls</hi> advice to stirre up the gift that is in thee, awaken &amp; revive thine owne spirit, by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and debating with thine owne heart, by consulting with God in his Word, diligent acquaintance and right knowledge of his Will, by fruitefull, and seasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, borrowing light from thy brothers candle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking or rectifying thy selfe by his example, this is that which the Scripture <hi>cals whetting the Law upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Deut. 6. 7.

Thirdly, when thou canst not doe a thing with life, yet doe it with <hi>obedience;</hi> when not in Comfort, yet with feare and trembling; when not as thou wert wont, yet as thou art able. God loves to bee sought when hee hides. <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my Soule loveth, where thou lodgest at noone?</hi> When <hi>Ezekiah</hi> could not pray he <hi>chatter'd</hi> and <hi>peep'd,</hi> and when thou art not able to speake thy desires, the Spirit can forme thy sighs into prayers?

Let him trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God,</hi> Esay, 50. 10.

                     <hi>of Christ,</hi> bending and framing the heart to stand in awe of Gods Word; for writing his Law, and putting his feare into the heart is the same thing with God. In which
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:16278:143"/>
respect (amongst others) men are said to bee <hi>Sealed</hi> by<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note> the Spirit, because that Spirituall Holinesse which is in the Word, is fashioned in the hearts of the Saints, as the image of the seale is in the waxe. As the light of the Sunne doth by reflection from the Moone illighten that part of the earth, or from a glasse that part of a roome from which it selfe is absent: <hi>So though the Church bee here absent from the Lord, yet his Spirit by the Word doth illighten and governe it:</hi> It is not the Moone alone, nor the glasse alone, nor yet the Sunne without the Moone or the glasse that illightneth those places vpon which it selfe doth not immediately shine, but that as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, by them as the instruments; so the Spirit doth not, and the Word cannot alone by it selfe convince or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, but the Spirit by the Word as its sword and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So then when the Spirit turnes a mans eyes inward to see the truth of the Word written in his owne heart, makes him put his Seale unto it, frameth the will to search, acknowledge and judge the worst of its selfe, to subscribe unto the righteousnesse of God in condemning sinne, and him for it, to take the office of the Word, and passe that sentence upon it selfe which the Word doth, then doth the Word spiritually <hi>Convince</hi> of sinne.</p>
                  <p>Which should teach us what to look for in <hi>the ministry of the word,</hi> namely that which will <hi>Convince</hi> us, that which puts an edge upon the Word, &amp; opens the heart &amp; makes it burne, namely the spirit of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>for by that only we can be brought unto the righteousnesse of Christ,</hi> we are not to despise the ordinances in our esteeme, when we find them destitute of such humane contributions and attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations which we haply expected, as <hi>Naaman</hi> did the waters of <hi>Iordan,</hi> for though there bee excellent use of <hi>Humane learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> when it is sanctified for opening the Word, as a baser colour is a good ground for a better; yet it is the Word alone which the Spirit worketh by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the flesh, and fleshly accessions of themselves profit no
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:16278:144"/>
more, nor adde no more reall vertue or lustre to the Word, then the weedes in a field do unto the Corne, or then the ground colour doth unto the beautie of that which is put upon it. We should therefore pray for the Spirit to come along with his Word; It is not enough to be at <hi>Bethesda,</hi> this house of mercie and grace, unlesse the Angell stirre, and the Spirit move upon these waters; It is Hee that must incline and put the heart into the Word, or else it will remaine as impotent, as before. But of this point also I have spoken at large upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scripture.</p>
                  <p>Having then thus shewed at large that the Spirit by the <hi>Commandment convinceth</hi> men to be in the <hi>state of sin</hi> both <hi>Actuall</hi> and <hi>Originall,</hi> imputed and inherent; what kinde of <hi>state</hi> that is, A <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Impotencie</hi> and <hi>Enmity;</hi> How it doth it, by quickning the Word, and opening the heart: Now we are very briefly to open the second point, That the <hi>Spirit</hi> by the <hi>Commandment</hi> convinceth a man to be under the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> or in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>death</hi> because of sinne. <hi>I died,</hi> for which we must note, First, that there is a <hi>two fold Guilt,</hi> First <hi>Reatus Concupiscentia,</hi> which is the meritoriousnesse of punishment, or liable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse unto punishment, which sinne brings with it: and <hi>Reatus personae,</hi> which is the actuall Obligation, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiousnesse of a person vnto punishment because of sinne. Now in as much as nature is not able to discover without the Spirit the whole malignity and obliquity that is in sinne, therefore it cannot sufficiently convince of the Guilt of sinne, which is a Resultancie therefrom, and is ever proportionable thereunto. In which respect the Iudgements of God are said to be unsearchable, Rom. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 33. <hi>And the wicked know not whither they goe,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2. 11. cannot have any full and proportionable notions of that wrath to come which their sinnes carry them unto.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee may note that there is a <hi>Twofold Conviction</hi> of this <hi>Guilt of sinne; A naturall Conviction,</hi>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:16278:144"/>
such as was in <hi>Cain, Iudas, Spira,</hi> and other despairing men; which ariseth from two grounds. First, the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> sense of Gods wrath in the first fruits thereof upon their consciences which must perforce beare witnesse to Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ustice therein; and this is that which the Apostle calls Torment, 1. Ioh. 4. 18. which though it may arise from naturall principles (for wee know even heathens have had their <hi>Laniatus</hi> and <hi>Ictus</hi> as the Historian speakes, their scourges and rendings of Conscience) yet is it much set forward by the Word, because therein is made more apparant to the Soule the Glory and the<note place="margin">Revel. 11. 10.

Secondly, such a faith as the Divels have, begotten by the Word, and assented unto by the secret suggestions of the heart, witnessing to it selfe that it hath deserved more then yet it feeles; and this begets a fearefull expectation of being devoured, surpriseth the heart with horrid tremblings and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions of the vengeance to come, which the Apostle calls the <hi>Spirit of bondage and feare.</hi> But all this being an <hi>Assent</hi> perforce extorted (for wicked men confesse their sinnes as the Divels confessed Christ, more out of<note place="margin">Matth. 8. 29.</note> Torment, then out of Love to God, or humiliation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his mighty hand) amounts to no more then a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Conviction.</hi>

                  <p>Now then since the <hi>Conviction</hi> of sinne, and of the death and Guilt thereof are not to drive men to despaire or blasphemie, but that they may beleeve and lay hold on the righteousnesse of Christ, which they are then most likely to doe, when sinne is made exceeding sinfull, and by consequence death exceeding deadly; give mee leave to set forth in two words what this Guilt of sinne is, that the necessitie of righteousnesse from Christ may appeare the greater, and his mercie therein bee the more glorified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Guilt</hi> is the <hi>Demerit</hi> of sinne, binding and subjecting the person in whom it is to undergoe all the punishments legally due the reunto. This <hi>Demerit</hi> is founded not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Constitution, Will, and Power of God over his owne Creatures, of whom hee may justly require what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever obedience hee giveth power to performe, but in the nature of his owne Holinesse and Iustice, which in sinne is violated and turned from: and this Guilt is after a sort Infinite, because it springeth out of the aversion from
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:16278:145"/>
an Infinite Good, the violation of an infinite Holynesse and Iustice, and the Conversion to the Creatures infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, if men could live ever to commit adultery with them. And as the Consequence and reward of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was the favour of God, conferring life and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the Creature, so the wages of sinne, which this<note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 3. Ioh. 3. 36. Gal. 3. 13.</note> Guilt assureth a sinner of, is the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> which the Scripture calleth <hi>Death and the Curse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Guilt</hi> being an <hi>Obligation</hi> unto punishment, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to consider what the nature of that curse and death is unto which it bindeth us over. <hi>Punishment</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring necessarie relation to a <hi>command,</hi> the trangression whereof is therein recompenced, taketh in these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. First, on the part of the Commander, a will to which the Actions of the subject must conforme, reveal'd and signified under the nature of a Law. Secondly, a justice which will, and thirdly, a power which can pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the transgressors of that Law. Secondly, on the part of the subject commanded there is requir'd, first, Reason and free-will originally, without which there can be no sinne; for though man by his brutishnesse and impotency which he doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract cannot make void the commands of God, but that they now binde men who have put out their light, and lost their libertie; yet originally God made no law to binde under paine of sinne, but that unto the obedience whereof hee gave reason and free-will Secondly, a debt and obligation, either by voluntarie sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as man to man; or naturall, as the creature to God, or both, sealed and acknowledged in the covenants betweene God and man, whereby man is bound to fulfill that law which it was originally enabled to observe. Thirdly, a forfeiture, guilt, and demerit upon the violation of that Law. Thirdly and lastly, <hi>the evill it selfe inflicted,</hi> wherein we consider, first, the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>qualitie</hi> of it, which is to have a <hi>destructive power,</hi> to oppresse and dis quiet the offender, and to violate the integritie of his well

being. For as sinne is a violation offered by man to the Law, so punishment is a violation retorted from the Law to man. Secondly, the <hi>Proportion</hi> of it to the offence, the greatnesse whereof is manifested in the majestie of God offended, and those severall relations of goodnesse, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, creation, redemption which he hath to man: in the quality of the creature offending, being the chiefe, and lord of all the rest below him: in the easinesse of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive obedience, in the unprofitablenesse of the wayes of sinne, and a world of the like aggravations. Thirdly, <hi>the end of it,</hi> which is not the destruction of the creature, whom as a creature God loveth, but the satisfaction of justice, the declaration of divine displeasure against sinne, and the manifestation of the glory of his power and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. So then <hi>Punishment</hi> is an evill or pressure of the Creature, proceeding from a Law giver just and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, inflicted on a reasonable Creature for and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable unto the breach of such a Law, unto the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance and obedience whereof the Creature was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally enabled, wherein is intended the glory of Gods just displeasure and great power against sinne, which hee naturally hateth.

When <hi>Iudas</hi> had listued to the Temptation of Satan to betray Christ, had set himselfe to watch the most private opportunitie, had been warned of it by Christ, and that upon a question of the most bold and impudent hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie that was ever made, <hi>Master, Is it I?</hi> (though it is not an improbable conjecture that <hi>Iudas</hi> at that very time upon the curse that was pronounced might secretly and for that time seriously resolve to give over his plot, and upon that resolution to aske the question) then at last, Christ by a sop did give Satan as it were a further<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 27. 28.</note> seisin of him, and the purpose of Christ was that that which he was to doe, hee might doe quickely. He was now wholly given up to the will of Satan, whose temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation haply before, though very welcome in regard of the purchase and project of gaine which was in it, had not fully silenc'd nor broken through all those reluctancies of Conscience, which were very likely to arise upon the first presentment of so hideous a suggestion; but now I say whether out of a sinister <hi>Construction</hi> of our Saviours words, <hi>That thou doest doe quickly,</hi> as if they had been, not as indeed they were, a giving him over to the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse of his owne lust, and to the rage of Satan, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an allowance of his intention, as knowing that hee was able to deliver himselfe out of their hands unto whom he should bee betraide, and so his treason should onely make way to Christs miracle and not to his crosse; or whether it were out of a secret presumption, that, notwithstanding Christ had made him know how his

Now I say after that soppe, and those words, without further respect to the strugglings and staggerings of his Conscience, hee goes resolvedly about that damned businesse, for he was now delivered unto the will of Sathan. The like libertie and commission was that which God gaue to the evill spirit against <hi>Ahab</hi> and his Prophets, that hee should goe<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>Lastly, the <hi>Punishment</hi> of sinne is <hi>Eternall,</hi> That wrath which in the day of the Revelation of Gods righteous Iudgement shall bee powred forth upon ungodly men.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 30. 1. Pet. 1. 18. Esai 35. 10. Ioh. 3. 36. 1. Cor. 1. 18. Eph. 4. 30. Rom. 8 23. Col. 3. 3, 4. 1. Ioh. 3 2.

So on the other side, though the wrath of God be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from Heaven already against all unrighteonsnesse, and <hi>Abideth</hi> vpon those that beleeve not, yet after an especiall manner is the last day called a <hi>day of wrath,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then the heapes, treasures, stormes and tempests, blackenesse and darkenesse of Gods displeasure shall in full force seize upon ungodly men.</p>
                  <p>And this wrath of God is of all other most unsuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. First, In regard of the <hi>Author,</hi> It comes from God; Now we know a little stone if it fall from a high place,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16278:148"/>
or a smal dart shot out of a strong bow wil do more hurt, then a farre greater that is but gently laid on. How we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then must the case of those be who shall have moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and milstones throwne with Gods owne arme from Heaven upon them: for though God in this life suffer himselfe to bee wrestled with, and even pressed downe, yet at last he shall come to shew forth the glory of his Power in the just condemnation of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in its <hi>owne nature,</hi> because it is most heavie, and invincible. All conquest over an evill must proceede either from <hi>Power,</hi> which is able to expell it, or from <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> that a man shall be delivered from it by those that have more power then himselfe; what ever evill it is which doth either keepe downe Nature that it connot rise, or hedge it in that it cannot escape, is very intollerable. Now Gods wrath hath both these in it. First, it is so great that it exceedes all the power of the Creature to overcome it, heavier then mountaines, hotter then fire, no chaffe nor stubble shall stand before it: and it shall be All within a man, folded up in his very substance, like the worme in the wood on which it feedes: And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly as it is heavie and so excludes the strength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to overcome it, so is it infinite too, and thus it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the hope of nature to escape it. The ground of which infinitenesse in punishment is the infinite dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betweene the Iustice of God which will punish, and the nature of man which must suffer. Gods Iustice being Infinite, the violation thereof in sinne must needes contract an infinite demerit, and debt (because in sinning we robbe God of his Glory, which we must repay him againe.) Now the satisfaction of an Infinite debt must needes be Infinite, either in degrees (which is impossible, For, first nothing can bee Infinite in Being, though it may in duration, but onely God. And, secondly if it could, yet a finite vessell were not able to hold an infinite wrath) or else in some other infinitenesse, which is either
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16278:149"/>
infinitenesse of <hi>worth</hi> in the person satisfying, or for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that infinitenesse of <hi>time,</hi> to suffer that whith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee suffered in an infinite measure: And this is the reason why Christ did not suffer infinitely in <hi>time,</hi> because there was in him a more excellent i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Mortall bodie,</hi> we here understand the <hi>whole man</hi> in this present estate, wherein he is obnoxious to death, which is an usuall figure to take the part for the whole, especially since the body is a weapon and instrument to reduce into act, and to execute the will of sinne.</p>
                     <p>Before I speake of the power of sinne, here are <hi>Two points</hi> offer themselves from the connexion of the words to those preceding, which I will but only name.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Sinne will abide for the time of this mortall life in the most regenerate,</hi> who can say, I have made my heart cleane, I am free from my sinne? <hi>David</hi> had his <hi>secret sinnes,</hi> which made him pray; and <hi>Paul</hi> his <hi>thorne in his flesh,</hi> which made him cry out against it. To the reasons of this point before produc'd wee may adde, that God suffers our sinnes to dwell in us, first to magnifie the <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his mercy,</hi> that notwithstanding he be provoked e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, yet he doth still spare us. It is said in one place,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:16278:151"/>
that when God saw that every Imagination of the<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5, 6.</note> thoughts of mans heart was continually evill, he said, <hi>I will destroy man</hi> whom I have created from off the face of the earth; yet afterwards God said, <hi>I will not againe curse the ground any more for mans sake, for the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>1.</note> 
                        <hi>of mans heart is evill from his youth.</hi> The places seeme at first view to be contradictory to one another. But we are thus to reconcile them, After there had been a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory offering made by <hi>Noah</hi> unto God upon an Altar, which was the type of Christ, it is said that God smelt a sweete savour, and resolved, I will no more curse the earth, not <hi>Because,</hi> but <hi>Although the imagination of mans heart be evill from his youth;</hi> that is, though men are so wicked that if I would <hi>Iure meo uti,</hi> take advantage to powre out againe my displeasure upon them, I might doe it every day, yet I will spare them notwithstanding their lusts continue in them. For we are not to understand the place as if it tended to the extenuation of originall sinne (as <note n="a" place="margin">Carthusian. Cornel. à lapide. Pighius. Greg. de val. To. 2. Disp 6. qu. 12. punct. 1. sect. 6.</note> some doe) I will take pitty upon them, Because of their naturall infirmities; but onely as tending to the magnifying of Gods mercy and patience, I will take pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon them, <note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Tarnou. Exerc. biblic.</hi> Ios. 17. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>though</hi> I might destroy them. For so the originall word is elsewhere taken. Thou shalt drive out the Cananites, <hi>Though they have iron chariots, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, to magnifie the <hi>Glory of his powerfull pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> that being daily provoked yet he hath power to be patient still. In ordinary esteeme when an enemie is daily irritated, and yet comes not to revenge his quarrell, we accompt it impotency and unprovision, but <hi>in God his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is his power.</hi> When the people of Israel murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the report of giants in the land, and would have made a Captaine to returne into Egypt, and have stoned <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> so that Gods wrath was ready to breake out upon them, and to disinherite them, this was the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that <hi>Moses</hi> used to mediate for them, <hi>Let the Power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken,</hi>

                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:16278:151"/>
                        <hi>The Lord is long-suffering and of great mercy.</hi> Thou hast shewed the Power of thy mercy from Egypt untill now, even so pardon them still. If we could conceive God to have his owne justice joyned with the impotency and impatiency of man, wee could not conceive how the world should all this while have subsisted in the midst of such mighty provocations. This is the only reason why he doth not execute the fiercenesse of his wrath, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume men, because he is <hi>God and not man,</hi> not subject to<note place="margin">Hos. 11. 9. Mal. 3. 6.</note> the same passions, changes, impotencies as men are. If a house be very weake and ruinous, &amp; clogg'd with a sore waight of heavy materials which presse it downe too, there must be strength in the props that doe hold it up; <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1. An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>os 2. 13.</note> even so that patience of God which upholds these rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous tabernacles of ours, that are pressed downe with such a waight of sinne, a waight that lies heavie even upon Gods mercy it selfe, must needs have much strength and power in it.</p>
                     <p>The second point from the Connexion is, <hi>That our Death with Christ unto sinne is a strong argument against the raigne and power of sinne in us.</hi> Else wee make the death of Christ in vaine, for in his death hee came with water and bloud, not onely with bloud to justifie our<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 6.</note> persons, but with water to wash away our sinnes.</p>
                     <p>The Reasons hereof are, first, <hi>Deadnesse argues disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to any such workes as did pertaine to that life unto which a man is dead. Such then as is the measure of our death to sinne, such is our disability to fulfill the lusts of it. Now though sinne be not quite expir'd, yet it is with Christ nail'd upon a crosse, <hi>They that are Christs have</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts:</hi> so that in a regenerate man it is no more able to doe all its owne will, then a crucified man is to walke up and downe, and to do those businesses which he was wont to delight in. <hi>He that</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>is borne of God sinneth not neither can sinne, because he is borne of God, and his seede abideth in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="276" facs="tcp:16278:152"/>Secondly, <hi>Deadnesse argues disaffection.</hi> A condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man cares not for the things of this World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is in Law dead, and so reserv'd to an execution, and utterly devested of any right in the things hee was wont to delight in: the sight or remembrance of them doth but afflict him the more. A divorc'd man cares not for the things of his wife, because in law she is dead vnto him, and hee unto her. So should it bee with us and sin, because we are dead with Christ, therefore we should shew it no affection.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Deadnesse argues liberty, unsubjection, justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 7. 7. 1, 4.</note> He that is <hi>dead is freed from sinne,</hi> as the woman is from the husband after death. And therefore being freed thus from sinne we should not bring our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> bondage againe, but stand fast in the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Christ hath set us free, and sinne should appeare in<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1. Heb. 9. 14.</note> our eyes, as it is in it selfe a <hi>dead thing,</hi> full of noisome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, horrour, and hideous qualities.</p>
                     <p>We therefore should labour to shew forth the power of the death of Christ in our dying to sinne; for this is certaine we have no benefit by his sufferings, except we<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 10.</note> have fellowship in them, &amp; we have no more fellowship in them, then we can give proofe of by our dying dayly to sinne; <hi>For his blood clenseth from all sinne.</hi> Let us not<note place="margin">1. Ioh 1. 7.</note> by raigning sinne Crucifie Christ againe, for he dieth no more: <hi>In that hee died, hee died once unto sinne; Death</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>hath no more power ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Cor. 5. 15.</note> have no more power over us, but that being once dead to sinne, we should thenceforth live unto him that died for us. There is a speech in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which though proceeding from <hi>Novatianisme in him,</hi> doth yet in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated and qualified sense carry the strength of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles argument in it, <hi>Si possit fornicatio &amp; moechia denno</hi>

                        <hi>admitti, poterit &amp; Christus denno mori,</hi> If fornication and adultery may bee againe committed by a man dead to sinne in that raging and complete manner as before, if
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:16278:152"/>
raigning sinne after it hath beene ejected out of the Throne, and nail'd to a Crosse, can returne to its totall and absolute soveraigntie as before, Christ may dye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for the sinnes of a Iustified and regenerate man are Crucified upon his Crosse, and in his body.</p>
                     <p>Now I proceede to the maine thing in the Text, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Regall power of sinne.</hi> It is an observation of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> on the Text, which though by some rejected as too nice, I shall yet make bold to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend<note place="margin">Non dicit ne Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannidem exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat, sed ne reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.

The Apostle did not say (say they) <hi>Let not sinne Tyrannize,</hi> for that is sius <hi>owne</hi> worke and not <hi>ours,</hi> as the Apostle sayeth, <hi>Now then is it no more I that doe it, but sinne that dwelleth in me,</hi> all the service which is done to a tyrant is out of <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,</hi> and not out of <hi>obedience:</hi> But he sayes, <hi>Let it not raigne in you,</hi> for to the raigne of a King the obedience of the Subjects doth as it were <hi>Actively</hi> concurre (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the subjects are rather patients then agents in a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.) So then in a <hi>Raigning King</hi> there is a more Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power then in a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> for a Tyrant hath only a <hi>Coactive power over the persons,</hi> but a King hath a <hi>sweete power over the wills and affections of his Subiects,</hi> they freely and heartily love his person, and rejoyce in his service; which rule though it be not perpetuall in the letter and in civill governements; (for the unwillingnesse of a people to serve a Prince may not onely arise from his tyrannie, but even when he is just and moderate, from their owne rebellion) yet it is most generall and certaine in the state of sinne which is never a King over rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous subjects, who of themselves reject its yoke and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement.</p>
                     <p>For the better discovery then of the <hi>power of sinne</hi> we must note first that there are but <hi>three wayes</hi> after which sinne may be in a man.

a man against his will, taking advantage of some present distemper of minde, or difficultie of estate; as in <hi>David</hi> of idlenesse, in <hi>Peter</hi> of teare and danger, or the like.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:16278:153"/>
that upon which that power, where it is, is grounded, namely a kinde of Title and right over the soule.</p>

                     <p>Now let us in the next place consider <hi>the power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by sinne makes its commands to bee obeyed,</hi> wherein it is more strong and sure then a Tyrant, who ruleth against the will of his Subjects. The particulars of this strength may be thus digested.</p>
                     <p>First sinne hath much <hi>strength from it selfe,</hi> and that in these regards. First, it is very <hi>wilfull,</hi> it is as it were all will. Therefore it is called in the Scripture, <hi>The will</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 3. 1. Pet. 4. 3. Ioh 1. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>of the flesh, and the will of the Gentiles, and the will of men.</hi> And the will is the seate of strength, especially seeing the will of man, and the will of sinne or the flesh are in the Scripture phrase all one. If a man had one will and sinne another, mans will drew one way and sinnes another, peradventure his power to resist might be stronger then sinnes power to command: but when the will of sinne
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16278:155"/>
is in the will of man as a bias in a bowle, as a flame in smoke, as a weight or spring to an engine, as spirits in the body, to actuate and determine it to its owne way, how can a man resist the will of sinne, who hath no other then a sinfull will to resist by?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as sinne is wilfull, so it is very <hi>passionate and lustfull,</hi> which addes wings as it were to the commands of sinne. The Apostle cals them <hi>passions,</hi> and those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king passions; when we were in the flesh, <hi>The motions of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 5.</note>

Lust is in the best, but these violent passions and ardencies of lust are shrewd symptomes of the raigne of sinne. To be fierce, implacable, head-strong, like the horse in the battaile, and that not upon extraordinary distemper or surprizall (as <hi>Ionah</hi> and <hi>Asa</hi> were) but habitually, so as on any<note place="margin">Iona. 4. 9. 2.

Tim. 3. 3, 4, 5.</note> For sinne must not hold its power where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath any.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it hath <hi>Lawes and Edicts,</hi> full of wisedome and cunning, edg'd and temper'd with many encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and provocations to those that obey, which (as I<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 25. 2.

                     <p>Fourthly, it is full of <hi>flattery</hi> to entice and woe a man, cunning to observe all the best seasons to surprize the soule. And though enticements be base, yet they are very strong, like a gentle showre or a soft fire they sinke, and get in closer then if they should be more violent. That which is as soft as oyle in the touch, may be as sharpe as swords in the operation. And therefore as a man is said in one place to be <hi>enticed by lust,</hi> so elsewhere he is said<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 14.</note> to be <hi>driven and thrust on</hi> by lust. <hi>Take heede to your</hi>

                     <p>In one word, sinne is throughly furnish'd with all sorts<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 22. 2. Cor. 10. 4, 5.</note> of <hi>Armour,</hi> both for defence and opposition, all strong holds, all reasonings and imaginations, and thoughts

                     <p>But lastly and principally lust hath much strength <hi>in and from us.</hi> First, because they are <hi>naturall</hi> unto us. <hi>A mans sinne is himselfe,</hi> it is call'd by the name of our <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 6. 6. Eph. 4. 22. Col. 5. 9.</note>

                        <hi>married</hi> as the Church is to Christ. And this serves much to set forth the power of sin. For the love of the subject is the strength of the Soveraigne; a king shall then certainely be obeyed, when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands such things as it were diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for him to prohibite. Secondly, lust hath from us <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi> to set forward its strength, The heart a forge to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, and members instruments to execute, the heart a wombe to conceive, and the members midwives to bring forth lusts into act. Lastly, sinne must be very strong in us because we are by nature <hi>full of it.</hi> So the Apostle saies of naturall men that they were <hi>filled with all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousuesse,</hi>
                        <pb n="286" facs="tcp:16278:158"/>
                        <hi>and full of envie, debate, deceite, &amp;c.</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 29. 2. Pet. 2. 14.</note> that they have <hi>Eyes full of Adultery,</hi> that cannot cease from sinne. Now where there is All of a strong thing that must needes be exceeding strong. If all the foure windes should meete together in their full strength, what moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines would they not roote up by the foundation? What a mighty rage and strength is there in the sea, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is full of waters, and All water belongs unto it? Who is able to looke upon the sunne, or endure the brightnesse of that glorious Creature, onely because it is Full of light? the same reason is in fleshly lusts, they are very strong in us, because our nature is <hi>full</hi> of them, and because all their <hi>fulnesse</hi> is in our nature.</p>
                     <p>Now this strength which is thus made up of so many ingredients, doth further appeare in the <hi>Effects</hi> of it, which are these <hi>Three,</hi> all comprised in the generall word of <hi>Obeying</hi> it in the Lusts thereof, which denotes <hi>a full &amp; uncontroled Power</hi> in sin.

Secondly, <hi>Executing of it,</hi> and bringing into act the sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of the flesh thus conceived, yeelding to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, drudging in the service, drawing iniquitie with cords and cartropes, resigning both heart and hand to the obedience of sin. Thirdly, <hi>Finishing it,</hi> going on without wearinesse or murmuring, without repenting or repining in the waies of Lust, running in one constant chanell, till like the waters of Iordan the soule drop into the dead lake. All these three Saint <hi>Iames</hi> hath put together to shew the gradations, and the danger of fleshly Lusts. <hi>Euery man is Tempted, when he is drawne away of his owne Lusts and enticed; Lust when it hath Conceiued bringeth forth sinne, and sinne when it is Finished bringeth forth Death.</hi> First, there is the <hi>Suggestion,</hi> Lust draweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:16278:158"/>
and enticeth. Secondly, the <hi>Conception and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in the delight and consent of the will. Thirdly, the <hi>Execution,</hi> and bringing into act. Fourthly, the <hi>Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and accomplishment of Lust,</hi> filling vp the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, going on vnweariedly to the last, till there is no hope, and so abusing the patience and long suffering of God unto destruction. Sinne growes till it be ripe for the slaughter; now if men in the interim cut off their sinnes, and turne to God before the decree be sealed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he stirre up all his wrath, and will suffer his Spirit no longer to strive, if they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate that litle time &amp; strength they have left to Gods Service, then the kingdome of sin is pull'd downe in them. To this purpose is the Counsell<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27.</note> of <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezar; That he should breake off his sinnes by righteousnesse, and his iniquities by shewing mercie to the poore,</hi> that is, he should relinquish those sins which were most predominant in him; his unjustice, and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and tyrannie against poore men (thus <hi>Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of righteousnesse, and temperance, and judgement to come, to <hi>Felix</hi> a corrupt and lascivious Governor) &amp; by that meanes his tranquillitie should be lengthened, not by way of <hi>merit</hi> (for a theefe deserves no pardon, because he gives over stealing) but by way of <hi>mercie and favour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hitherto I have but shewed that sin is a strong king. But this is not enough to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ive men to Christ, (which is my principall scope.) It is further required that men bee <hi>Convinc'd of being under this power of sinne.</hi> The first use then which I shall shew you may bee made of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is <hi>for Conviction and tryall of the raigne of sinne in our selves;</hi> for the more distinct expediting whereof I shall propose these <hi>three cases to be resolved.</hi> First whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sin may raigne in a Regenerate man so, as that this power and kingdome of sinne shall consist with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ? Secondly, <hi>How wicked men may be Convinc'd</hi> that sinne raignes in them, and what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is betweene the power of sinne in them,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:16278:159"/>
and in the regenerate? Thirdly, why every sinne doth not raigne in every unregenerate man?</p>
                     <p>For the first of these, we must remember in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that sinne doth then raigne when a man doth <hi>obey it in the lusts thereof,</hi> when he doth <hi>yeelde up himselfe to</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 26. 18. Col. 1. 13.</note>

                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Law, but under Grace,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when a man is delivered from the Obligations of the Law, he is then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the strength of sinne; (for the <hi>strength of sinne is the Law) And he that is borne of God sinneth not,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 56. 1. Ioh. 3. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>neither can sinne,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> that is, cannot obey sinne in all the lusts and commands thereof, as a servant to sinne, from which service hee hath ceased by being borne of God (for no man can bee Gods Sonne and sinnes servant:) for we are to distinguish betweene <hi>doing the worke of sinne, and obeying sinne in the lusts thereof.</hi> As a man may doe divine workes, and yet not ever in obedience to God, so a man may be subject as a <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> in this or that particular tyrannie of sinne, who is not obedient as a <hi>servant</hi> to all the governement of sinne, for that takes in the whole will, and an Adequate sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission thereof to the peaceable and uncontroll'd power of sinne. Let us then inquire how farre the power of sinne may discover itselfe in the most regenerate. First, the best have flesh about them, and that flesh where ever it is worketh, and rebelleth against the Spirit of Christ, <hi>so that they cannot doe the things which they would.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this flesh is of itselfe indifferent to great sinnes as well as to small, and therefore by some strong temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it may prevaile to carrie the Saints unto great sins, as it did <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and others. Thirdly, this fleshis as much in the will as in any other part of regenerate
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:16278:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men, and therefore when they commit great sinnes, they may commit them with consent, delight, and willingnesse of heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fourthly, this flesh is in their members as well as in their wills, and therefote they may actuate, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute those wills of sinne which they have consented unto. Fifthly, we confesse that by these sinnes thus committed, the Conscience of a regenerat man is wasted and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and overcome by the power of sinne, and such a particular grievous Guilt contracted, as must first bee washed away by some particular repentance, before that man can be againe qualified to take actuall possession of his inheritance, or to be admitted unto glory. In which case that of the apostle is most certaine, <hi>that the very righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>shall scarsely be saved.</hi> For wee are to note that as some things may indispose a man for the present use, or dispossesse him of the <hi>Comforts and Emoluments,</hi> which yet are not valid enough to devest him of the whole <hi>right and state</hi> in a living: so some sinnes may bee of so heavie a nature as may unqualifie a man for an actuall admittance into Heaven, or possession of glory, which yet doe not nullifie his Faith, nor extinguish his Title and interest unto it. Thus we see that sinne may in the most holy have great power; the examples whereof are all written for our learning, to teach us what is indeede within us, how circumspectly wee should walke, how watchfull over our hearts, how stedfast in our Covenant, lest wee fall after the example of those men, and so breake our bones as <hi>David</hi> did. For one great sinne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously committed, will bring either such a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, as will make thee live in a wretched secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and neglect of thy service, and peace with God; Or such a wofull experience of his wrath and heavie displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against sinne, as will even bruise thy Conscience, and burne up thy bowels, and make thee goe drooping and disconsolate it may be all thy dayes.</p>

                     <p>Others there are of a more calme, civill, composed course, men much wiser but not a dramme holyer then those before. And here mainely stickes the inquirie, and that upon <hi>Three exceptions,</hi> with which they may seeme to evade, and shift off this power of sinne.</p>
                     <p>First, in those men there appeareth not so soveraigne and absolute a dominion of sinne as hath been spoken of, in as much as they seeme to live in faire externall confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to the truthes which they have learned. To which I

answere first in generall, that <hi>there may bee a raigne of sinne where it is not perceived,</hi> and that <hi>Insensibility</hi> is a maine argument of it. For this is a certaine rule, the more tenderly and seriously any man is affected with sense and sorrow for the power of sinne, the more hee is delivered from it. The young man in the Gospell was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that hee had kept the whole Law, and little thought that his owne possessions were his king, and that he was a vassall to his owne wealth, till Christ convinced him of a mighty raigne of covetousnesse in his heart. A ship may in the midst of a calme by reason of a great mist, and the negligence of the Marriners to sound and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their distances from land, split it selfe against a rocke, as well as be cast vpon it by some irresistible storme: and so that man who never fathams his heart, nor searcheth how neere he may be to ruine, but goes leisurely and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly on in his wonted formall and pharisaicall securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may, when he thinkes nothing of it, as likely perish under the power of sin, as he in whom the rage thereof is most apparant. As there is a great strength in a River when it runnes smoothest and without noyse, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately discovers it selfe when any bridge or obstacle is set up against it: so when sinne passeth with most stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and undisturbance through the heart, then is the raigne of it as strong as ever, and upon any spirituall and searching opposition will declare it selfe. The Pharises were rigid, demure, saint-like men, while their hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie was let alone to runne calmely and without noyse; but when Christ by his spirituall expositions of the Law, his Heavenly conversation, his penetrating and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Sermons, had stopt the current, and disquieted them in their course, wee finde their malice swell into the very sinne against the holy Ghost. It is the light of the Sunne which maketh day when it selfe lies shut under a cloud and is not seene; so in every naturall man there is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and prevalencie of sinne, which yet may lie undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:16278:162"/>
under some generall moralities. Thus as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the fable had a true sting while it lay in the snow, though it shewed not it selfe but at the fire: so there may be a regall power in sinne, when upon externall reasons it may for a time dissemble it selfe. <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Ieroboams</hi> wife were as truely Princes in their disguise, as in their robes; and a Sow as truely a Swine when washed in a spring of water, as when wallowing in a sinke of dirt.

                        </gap>ticular opening of this point it will be needefull to answere some few questions touching the raigne of some particular sinnes which haply are seldome so thought of. And the first is <hi>Touching smallsinnes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may be said to be raigning sinnes?</hi> unto which I answere, That it is not the <hi>greatnesse</hi> but the <hi>power of sin</hi> which makes it a <hi>king.</hi> We know there are <hi>reguli</hi> as well as <hi>reges,</hi> kings of Cities and narrow territories, as well as Emperours over vast provinces. Nay many times a sinne may be great in <hi>Abstracto,</hi> as the fact is measured by the Law, and yet <hi>in Concreto,</hi> by Circumstances, it may not be a raigning sinne in the person committing it: and on the contrary <hi>a small sinne in the nature of the fact, may be a raigning sinne in the commission;</hi> as in a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration a man not halfe as rich as another may bee the chiefe magistrate, and another of a farre greater estate may bee an underling in regard of Governement. As a small stone throwne with a strong arme will doe more hurt then another farre greater if but gently laid on, or sent forth with a fainter impression: so a small sinne, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with a high hand, with more security, presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:16278:163"/>
and customarinesse, then others, will more waste the conscience then farre greater out of infirmitie or sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den surprizall. As wee see drops frequently falling will eare into a stone, and make it hollower then some few farre heavier strokes could have done, or as water pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into a Sieve with many small holes, or into a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse vessell, is equally cast away; A Ship may as well perish upon sands as rockes. <note place="margin">

                     <p>The second Question is, <hi>Whether privy and secret sins which never breake forth into light may raigne.</hi> To which I answere, That of all other sinnes, those which are secret have the chiefest rule, such as are privy pride, hypocrisie, selfe-justification, rebellion, malitious projects against the Word and worship of God, &amp;c. The Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares wicked mens hearts to an <hi>Oven,</hi> Hos. 7. 6, 7.

this may bee one of the depths and projects of Sathan against the soule of a man, to let him live in some faire and plausible conformitie for the outward conversation, that so his rule in the heart may be the more quiet both from clamours of conscience, and from cure of the Word.</p>
                     <p>The third Question is, <hi>Whether sinnes of ignorance may be raigning sinnes?</hi> To which I answere, That it is not mens knowledge of a king which makes him a king, but his owne power. <hi>Saul</hi> was a king when the witch knew<note place="margin">1.

A letter written in an unknowne language, or in darke and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Characters, is yet as truely a letter as that which is most intelligible and distinct; so though men make a shift to fill their consciences with darke and unlegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinnes, yet there they are as truely as if they were written in capitall Characters. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> persecution was a sinne of Ignorance, that was the only thing which left roome for the mercy of God, so he faith of himselfe, <hi>I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly, through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, the Power of pious and vertuous education; for many men have their manners as the Colliar had his faith, meerely by tradition, and upon credit from their forefathers.

                           </gap> of affections proceede from causes homogeneall and uniforme,</hi> and that the same temper and disposition of minde will serve to produce effects in apparance contrary. When two men contend with much violence to maintaine two different opinions, it may easily bee discerned by a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stander by, that it is the same love of victory, the same contentious constitution of Spirit which did foster
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:16278:168"/>
those extreme discourses, and many times men would not be at such distance in tenents, if they did not too much concurre in the pride and vaine glory of an opinionative minde. And surely so is it in matters of religion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, many times courses extremely opposite are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd out of the selfe same uniforme frame and temper of spirit; a humor pertinaciously to adhere to the wayes which a man hath beene bred in, may upon contrary educations produce contrary effects, and yet the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall reason bee the same, as it is the same vigor and vertue of the earth which from different seedes put into it produceth different fruites. So then a man may abstaine from many evils, and doe many good things meerely out of respect to their breeding, out of a native ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and faire opinion of their fathers pietie, without any such experimentall and convincing evidence of the truth, or Spirituall and Holy love of the goodnesse, by which the true members of Christ are moved unto the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Legall and Affrighting Power which is in the Word, when it is set on by a skilfull master of the assemblies. For though nothing but the Evangelicall vertue of the Word begets true and spirituall obedience, yet outward conformitie may be fashioned by the terror of it. As nothing but vitall, seminall, and fleshly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples can organize a living and true man; yet the strokes and violence of hammers, and other instruments being moderated by the hand of a cunning worker can fashion the shape of a man in a dead stone. As <hi>Ahab</hi> was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Word in some degree, when yet he was not converted by it.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the power of a <hi>naturall</hi> illightned Conscience, either a wakened by some heavie affliction, or affrighted with the feare of Iudgement, or, at best, assisted with a temper of generousnesse and ingenuitie, a certaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of disposition which can by no meanes endure

to be condemned by its owne witnesse, nor to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on courses which doe directly the wart the practicall principles to which they subscribe. For (as I observed before) many men who will not do good <hi>Obedientially,</hi>

                     <p>First they Differ in the <hi>Principles</hi> whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede. The one proceeds from a spirit of feare and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, the other from a spirit of love and delight.

In one word, a <hi>naturall conscience</hi> doth onely shew the <hi>danger of sinne,</hi> and so makes a man <hi>feare it;</hi> but a <hi>Spirituall conscience</hi> shewes the <hi>Pollution of sinne,</hi> the extreme contrarietic which it beares to the love of our heart, the rule of our life, the Law of God, and so makes a man <hi>hate it,</hi> as a thing contrary not only to his <hi>happinesse,</hi> but<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 4.</note> to his <hi>nature,</hi> of which he hath newly beene made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker. A dogge will be brought by discipline to for beare those things which his nature most delights in, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his ravine is changed into a better temper, but the following paines makes him abstaine from the present baite: so the conflict of the faithfull is with the unholy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinne, but the conflict of other men is onely with the Guilt and other sensuall incommodities of sinne. And though that may make a man forbeare and returne, yet not unto the Lord: <hi>They have not cryed unto me,</hi> saith the<note place="margin">Hos. 7. 14.</note> Lord, <hi>with their heart, when they howled upon their beds.</hi> Their prayers were not cries, but howlings, brutish and meere sensuall complaints, because they proceeded not from their hearts, from any inward and sincere affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely from feare of that hand whith was able to

As a sicke man eates meat, not for love of it, which he takes with much reluctancie and disrellish, but for feare of death which makes him force himselfe (a. <hi>Saul</hi> said to <hi>Samuel</hi>) against his will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as<note place="margin">1.

In a Tempest the marriners will cast out all their wares, not out of any hatred to the things (for they throw over their very hearts into the Sea with them) but because the safety of their lives, and preservation of their goods will not stand together; not <hi>sub intuitu mali, sed min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus a <hi>Naturall conscience</hi> throwes away sinne as wares, and therefore never forbeares it but in a Tempest of wrath, and sense of the curse and quickly returnes to it againe; but a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conscience throwes out sinne as corrupt and stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king water, and therefore is uniformely disaffected to it, and alwayes laboureth to be delivered from it. A scullion or colliar will not dare handle a coale when it is full of fire, which yet at other times is their common use; wheras a man of a more cleanly education, as he will not then, because of the fire, so not at any time, because of the foulnesse: so here a <hi>Naturall conscience</hi> for forbeares <hi>sinne somtimes,</hi> when the guilt and curse of it doth more appeare, which yet at other times it makes no seruple of; but a <hi>Spirituall conscience</hi> abstaines <hi>alwayes,</hi> because of the basenesse and pollution of it. The one feares <hi>sinne,</hi> because it hath fite in it to burne; the other hates <hi>sinne,</hi>
                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:16278:172"/>
because it hath filth in it to pollute the Soule.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, these conflicts differ in their <hi>seates and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The naturall Conflict is in severall faculties,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the understanding and the will, or the will and the affections, and so doth not argue any universall renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather a rupture and schisme, a confusion and disorder in the soule: But a <hi>spirituall conflict is in the same facultie,</hi> will against will, affection against affection, heart against heart, because sinne dwels still in our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body; Neither doe the spirit and the flesh enter into covenant to share and divide the man, and so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side asunder in severall faculties, and not molest one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers governement; there can be no agreement betweene the strong man and him that is stronger, Christ will hold no treatie with Beliall; he is able to save to the uttermost, and therefore is never put to make compositions with his enemie; he will not disparage the power of his owne Grace so much as to entertaine a parlie with the flesh. So then they fight not from severall forts onely, but are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver struggling like <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> in the same wombe.

Flesh and spirit are in a man as light and darkenesse in the dawning of the day, as heate and cold in warme water, not severed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct parts, but universally interweav'd and coexistent in all. There is the same proportion in the naturall and spirituall conflict with sinne, as in the change of motion in a bowle. A Bowle may be two wayes alter'd from that motion which the impressed violence from the ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So is it in the turning of a man from sinne; A naturall man goes on with a full consent of heart, no bias
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:16278:173"/>
in the will or affections to moderate or abate the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; only sometimes by chance he meetes with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed judgement, or with a naturall conscience, which like a banke turnes the motion, or disappoints the heart in the whole pleasure of that sinne; but in another, where haplie he meetes with no such obstacle, he runnes his full and direct course. But now a spirituall man hath a Bias and Corrective of Grace in the same facultie where sin is, which doth much remit the violence, and at length turne the course of it. And this holdes in every sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Corrective is not casuall, or with respect onely to this or that particular, but is firmely fix'd in the parts themselves on which the impressions of sinne are made.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they differ in <hi>the manner or qualities of the conflict.</hi> For first, <hi>a naturall conflict</hi> hath ever <hi>Treacherie</hi> mixed with it, but a Spirituall conflict is faithfull and sound throughout; and that appeares thus. <hi>A Spirituall heart</hi> doth ever ground its fight out of the Word, labors much to acquaint it selfe with that, because there it shall have a more distinct view of the enemy, of his armies, holdes, supplies, traines, weapons, strategems. For a spirituall heart sets it selfe seriously to fight against every method, deceite, armor of lust, as well against the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, as the guilt of sinne.

The opposition then betweene the naturall conscience and sinne is like the opposition betweene fire and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in some subjects; the conflict betweene the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conscience and sinne is like the opposition betweene fire and coldnesse. Put mettall into the fire, and the heat will dissolve and melt it, but put a bricke into the fire, and that will not melt nor soften (because the consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of it doth not arise <hi>Ex causâ frigidà,</hi> but <hi>siccâ</hi>) but<note place="margin">Vid.

Fourthly, the naturall makes a man never a whit the stronger against the next assault of Temptation, whereas the spirituall begets usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more circumspection, prayer, faith, humiliation, growth, acquaintance with the depth and mysteries of sinne, skill to manage the spirituall armour, experience of the truth, power, and promises of God, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, they differ in their <hi>end. The naturall</hi> is onely to pacifie the clamors of an unquiet conscience, which ever takes Gods part, and pleads for his service against the sinnes of men. The spirituall is with an intent to please and obey God, and to magnifie his Grace which is made perfect in our weakenesse.</p>

But lastly and principally the different administration of Gods ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall restraining Grace (which upon unsearchable and most wise and just reasons he is pleased in severall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to distribute unto severall men) may bee conceived a full reason, why some men are not given over to the rage and frenzie of many lusts, who yet live in a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and plenary obedience unto many others.</p>

Fourthly, It raigneth <hi>without any fruite,</hi> hope, or benefit, <hi>What fruit had you then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?</hi> Rom. 6. 21. Lastly the raigne of sin is but momentary, at the length both it selfe and all its subjects shall be subdued. <hi>The World passeth away, and the lusts thereof, but he that doth the Will of God abideth for ever.</hi> 1.

If a childe new borne should lie exposed in its blood to the injurie of a cold ayre, not have the Navell cut, nor the body wrapp'd, or wash'd, or tended at all, how quickly would it be that from the wombe of the mother it would drop into the wombe of the Earth? The state of sinne is an estate of nakednesse, blood, impotencie, obnoxiousnesse to all the temptations and snares of Sathan, to all the darts of death and hell. The ancients compare it to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a <hi>pit full of dirt and stones,</hi> a man is not onely <hi>polluted,</hi> but hee is <hi>bruized and wounded</hi> by it. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:16278:183"/>
there is no deformity nor filthines extant which did not rise from sinne. It is sin which puts <hi>bondage into the Creature,</hi> which brings discords and deformities upon the face of Nature. It is sin which put <hi>devilishnesse into Angels</hi> of Heaven, and hurried them downe from their first habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It is sin which put <hi>a sting into death,</hi> without which though it kil yet it cannot curse. It is sin which puts <hi>fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell,</hi> and supplies unto all eternitie the fuell &amp; materials for those unextinguishable slames. It is sin which puts <hi>hell into the Conscience</hi> and armes a man with terrours and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazements against himselfe. It is sin which puts rottennes and <hi>dishonour into the grave;</hi> he that died without sin rose up without corruption. It is sinne which wrings out those <hi>clamors and grones</hi> of bruit creatures, which wrestle under the curse of <hi>Adams</hi> fall. It is sin which <hi>enrageth and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi> one beast against another, and one man against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; one nation against another. It is sin which brought <hi>shame and dishonor upon that nakednesse</hi> unto which all the Creatures in Paradise did owe awe and reverence. It is sin which turn'd Sodom into a stinking lake, and Ierusalem the glory of the Earth, into a desolation and haunt for Owles and Bitterns. It is sinne which so often staineth Heauen and Earth with the markes of Gods vengeance, and which will one day roule up in darkenesse, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voute with fire, and reduce to its primitive confusion the whole frame of nature. It is sinne which puts <hi>horror into the Law,</hi> makes that which was at first a Law of life and liberty to be a Law of bondage and death, full of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, unprofitablenesse, hideousnesse, and curses. It is sinne which puts <hi>malignity and venome into the very Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> making it a <hi>savor of Death unto Death,</hi> that is, of another deeper death and sorer condemnation, which by trampling upon the blood of Christ wee draw upon our selves, unto that death under which wee lay before by the malediction of the Law.

And all this we have from those great and pretious promises which are made unto us of Holinesse and of Blessednesse. For as we say of the <hi>Word</hi> in generall, so more especially of the <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> they are <hi>operative words,</hi> and doe produce some reall effects, being received by faith. As a man when he receiveth a deed signed, sealed, witnessed, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, doth not onely take parchment or waxe, or emptie words, but hath thereby some fundamentall right crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the things in the deed mentioned to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd, so that the deed is <hi>declaratorie and operative of some Reall effects:</hi> so in the word and promises of God sealed by the bloud of Christ, ratified by the oath of the Covenant, testified by the Spirit of Truth, deliver'd by the hand of Mercy, and received by the hand of Faith, there doth not onely passe emptie breath and naked

words, but also some <hi>Reall effects</hi> by the intendment of God are thereby produc'd; namely, the cleansing of our sinfull nature from the pollutions of the world, and the transforming thereof into the image and purity of the divine nature.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Promises</hi> are the <hi>efficient causes of our puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as they are the Raies and Beames of Christ the Sunne of Righteousnesse,</hi> in whom they are all founded and established. They are <hi>All in him Yea, and in him</hi>

For the Promises are not made for any thing in us, nor have their stability in us, but they are made <hi>in and for Christ unto us,</hi> unto <hi>Christ</hi> in our behalfe, and unto us onely so farre forth as we are members of Christ. For they were not made to <hi>seeds as many, but to seed, namely</hi>

                        <hi>to Christ, in aggregato,</hi> as comprehending the head and the members in the unitie of one body.

When the conscience is once throughly acquainted with the sight of its owne foulnesse, with the sense of that life and power which is in concupiscence, it findes it then a great difficultie to rest in any hope of having lusts either subdued or forgiuen. The Psalmist, <hi>when his sore ranne, and ceased not, refused to be comforted,</hi> thought himselfe cast out of Gods fauour, as if his mercies were exhausted, and his promises come to an end, and his compassions were shut up, and would shew themselves no more. Therefore in this case the Lord carries our Faith to the consideration of his <hi>Power, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> which surpasseth not onely the knowledge but the very

coniectures and contrivances of the hearts of men. The Apostle saith, <hi>That Christ was declared to be the Sonne of God with power, according to the Spirit of holinesse, by the resurrection from the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>The Apostle in the beginning of the Chapter shewes that we are by nature subject to the Law, and death, which is an unavoidable consequent of the breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, even as the wife is to her husband as long as he liveth. And that by Christ we are delivered from that subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who hath shine our former husband, and <hi>taken him out of the way,</hi> as the Apostle elsewhere speakes. Now<note place="margin">Col. 2. 14.</note> because this doctrine of justification by faith in Christ, and deliverance from the Law by him, was mainely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Iewes, and was indeed that chiefe stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke which kept them from Christianitie (which<note place="margin">1.

                        </gap>s do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from two maine objections in this Chapter, which it seemes the Iewes did use against it.</p>
                     <p>The ground of both is tacitely implied, and it is the same generall hypothesis, or supposition that all delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is from evill, and carries necessary relation to some mischiefe which it presupposeth. Therefore if that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be true which teacheth deliverance from the Law, then it must be granted that the Law is evill; for to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subjected to that which is good is no deliverance, but a wilde and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>The former objection is made, vers. 7. <hi>What shall wee say then, is the Law sinne,</hi> that we should now heare of a

Shall wee admit a doctrine which over-throwes the Law and the Prophets? To this the Apostle answeres, <hi>God for bid. The Law is not sinne, for I had not knowne sinne but by the Law.</hi> It is true, <hi>sinne tooke occasion by the Law</hi> to become more sinfull, vers. 8. but this was not <hi>occasio data</hi> but <hi>arrepta.</hi> no occasion na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally offered by the law, but perversly taken by sinne, whose venomous property it is to suck poison out of that which is holy. So then the Law is not sinne, though by <hi>accident</hi> it enrage sinne. For of <hi>itselfe</hi> it serveth onely to discover and reveale it, ver. 9. But as the Gospell, as well when by mens perversnesse it is a <hi>savour of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Vpon this followes the second Objection in the words of the Text. <hi>Is that which is good made death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me?</hi> If a deliverance presuppose an evill in that from which we are deliver'd, and no evill but belongs either to sinne or death, then admitting a deliverance from the Law, if it be good in respect of holinesse, it must needs be evill in the other respect; and then that which is good is made death unto me. And this casts a more heavie

aspersion and dishonour upon God then the former, that he should give a Law meerely to kill men, and make that which in its nature is good, to be mortall in its use and operation. Wine, strong waters, hard meates are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves very good to those purposes unto which they are proper: yet under pretence of their goodnesse to cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Gold is good of it selfe, but to fetter a man with a chaine of gold would be no bounty, but a mockery. So to conceive God to publish a Law good indeed in it selfe, but deadly to the subjects, and to order that which is holy in its nature, to be harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and damnable to the Creature in its use, is so odious an aspersion upon so just and gratious a God, as may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring into suspicion and disgrace any doctrine which admits of so just an exception. Now to this likewise the Apostle answeres, <hi>God forbid.</hi> The Law is not given to condemne or clogge men, not to bring sinne or death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; It was not promulgated with any intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to kill or destroy the Creature. <hi>It is not sin in it selfe; It is not death unto us,</hi> in that sense as we preach it (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as subordinated to Christ and his Gospell.)

did (for sinne had betweene <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated and defaced the impressions of the morall Law, that man stood in need of a new edition and publication of it by the hand of <hi>Moses.</hi>) That place serves thus to make good the purpose of the Apostle in this. <hi>Sinne was in the world</hi> before the publication of the Law, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law is not sinne. But sinne was not imputed where there is no Law; men were secure and did flatter themselves in their way, were not apt to charge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne themselves for sin, without a Law to force them unto it. And therefore the Law did not come a new to beget sinne, but to reveale and discover sinne. <hi>Death</hi> likewise not onely was in the world, but <hi>raigned even over all men</hi> therein, before the publication of the Law. Therefore the Law is not death neither. There was Death enough in the world before the Law, there was wickednesse enough to make condemnation raigne over all men; therefore neither one nor other are naturall or essentiall consequences of the Law. It came not to beget more sinne; it came not to multiply and double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; there was enough of both in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Sinne enough to displease and provoke God, death enough to devoure and torment men. Therefore if the Law had beene usefull to no other purposes, then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage sinne, and condemne men; if Gods wisedome and power had not made it appliable to more wholsome and saving ends, he would never have new published it by the hand of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here then the observation which from these words we are to make, (and it is a point of singular and speciall consequence to understand the <hi>use of the Law</hi>) is this. <hi>That the Law was revived, and promulgated a new on Mount Sina, by the ministery of Moses, with no other then Evangelicall and mercifull purposes.</hi> It is said in one place, <hi>That the Lord hath no pleasure in the death of him that</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 32. Mic 7. 18.</note>

                        <pb n="372" facs="tcp:16278:203"/>
                        <hi>in mercie.</hi> Which notes, that God will doe more for the Salvation, then he will for the damnation of men; He will doe more for the magnifying of his mercy, then for the multiplying of his wrath: for if that require it, he will revive and new publish the Law, which to have aggravated the sinnes, and so doubled the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, He would never have done.</p>
                     <p>Before I further evidence the truth of this doctrine, It will be needefull to remove one Objection which doth at first proposall thereof offer it selfe. If God will doe more for his mercie, then for his wrath and vengeance, why then are not more men saved, then condemned? If Hell shall bee more fill'd then Heaven, is it not more then probable that wrath prevaileth against Grace, and that there is more done for furie, then there is for favour.

Thirdly, his Mercie is unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the price which procured it; Hee himselfe wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> to humble and empty himselfe, that he might shew mercie. His mercie was to be purchased by his owne merit; but his Iustice was provoked by the merit of sinne onely. Fourthly, Glory which is the fruite of Mercie is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in a few, then wrath and vengeance is in many; as one bagge full of gold may bee more valuable then tenne of silver. If a man should suppose that Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Iustice, being equally infinite and glorious in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, should therefore have the same equall proportion observed in the dispensation and revealing of them to the world; wee might not therehence conclude, that that proportion should be Arithmeticall, that mercy should be extended to as many, as severitie. But rather as in the payment of a summe of mony in two equal portions, whereof one is in gol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>, the other in silver, though there bee an equalitie in the summes, yet not in the pieces by which they are paide: so, in as much as Glory being the communicating of Gods owne blessed Vision, Presence, Love, and everlasting Societie, is farre more honourable and excellent then wrath, therefore the dispensation of his Mercie in that amongst a few may bee exactly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the revelation of his Iustice amongst very many more in the other. Suppose wee a Prince, upon the just condemnation of a hundred malefactors, should professe, that as in his owne royall brest mercy and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice were equally poised and temper'd, so he would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve an equall proportion of them both towards that number of malefactors, suffering his justice to condemne, and his mercy to spare just so many as might preserve his Attributes <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and condemning all the rest for their Iust demerit. Fifthly, and lastly, let me problematically and by way of <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </hi> onely propose this question. Why may it not be justly said that there shall bee in Heaven <hi>as much Glorie</hi> distributed amongst those few which shall be saved, <hi>as wrath</hi> in Hell amongst those many which perish? I dare not speake where the Scripture is silent; yet this by way of argument may bee said. The proportion of wrath is measured by the finite sinnes of men, the proportion of Glory from the infinite merits of Christ. There is more excellencie and vertue in the merit of Christ to procure life for his few, then vilenesse or demerit in sinne to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure death for many. As there may bee as much liquor in tenne great vessels, as in a thousand smaller: so there may bee as much Glory by the merit of Christ in a few that are saved, as wrath, from the merit of sinne in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes that perish.</p>
                     <p>But to returne to that from whence I have digressed. Manifest it is that God will doe more for the magnifying of his mercie, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>It followeth vers 16. <hi>Now to Abraham and his seede were the Promises made, he saith not, and to seedes as of many, but as of one, and to thy seede, which is Christ.</hi>] Where by <hi>One,</hi> we understand one <hi>mystically</hi> and <hi>in ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregato,</hi>
                        <pb n="376" facs="tcp:16278:205"/>
not personally or individually; and by <hi>Christ, the whole Church,</hi> consisting of the Head and Members, as he is elsewhere taken. 1 Cor. 12 12. Now these words doe further ratifie the stabilitie of the Covenant; for though a Covenant bee in it selfe never so constant and irreversible, yet if all the parties which have interest in or by it should cease, the Covenant would of it selfe by consequence expire and grow voyde: but here, as the covenant is most constant in regard of the wisedome, and unvariablenesse of him that made it, so it can never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire for want of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>eede to whom it is made; for as long as Christ hath a Church, and Members upon earth, so long shall the Promise be of force.</p>
                     <p>Vers. 17. <hi>And this I say, that the Covenant which was confirmed before of God in Christ, the Law which was foure hundred and thirty yeeres after, cannot disanull that it should make the Promise of none effect.</hi>] These words are a Prolepsis or prevention of an objection which might be made. A man might thus argue: when two lawes are made, whereof the one is expresly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to the other, the later doth in common presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abrogate and disanull the former (else men should be bound to contraries, and so punishments would bee unavoydable.) But here wee finde that foure hundred and thirty yeeres after the promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was a Law published extremely contrary unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: A law without mercy or compassion, a law both impossible and inexorable, which can neither be obeyed, nor endured: therefore it should seeme that some cause or other had hapned to make God repent, and revoke his former covenant. The Apostle retorts this Objection. And his meaning I thus apprehend. If there bee a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made, by a <hi>Lawgiver</hi> in wisedome infinite, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see before hand, and to prevent any inconveniences which might follow upon it, any reasons which might fall out to abrogate it; A <hi>Lawgiver</hi> in all his wayes constant
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:16278:205"/>
and immutable, (as being by no improvidence, disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, or unexpected emergencies ever put to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent) and this covenant made to a man and his seede for ever, and that without dependance upon any condition, (being all of Grace and Promise) save onely that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> have a seede, and Christ a Body: Then if it happen, that another law be after made, which <hi>primâ facie,</hi> and in strict construction, doth implie a contradiction to the termes and nature of the former Law (for Abrogation notwithstanding whereof there have no other reasons at all <hi>de novo</hi> intercurr'd, then only such as were actually in being when it was made, namely the sinnes of the world, and yet were not then valid enough to prevent the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and therefore by consequence have no force to alter or disanull it) then it is certaine that this latter law must be understood in some other sense, and admitte of some other subordinate use, which may well consist with the being and force of the former covenant; and not in that which <hi>primâ facie</hi> seemes to contradict, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to abrogate it.</p>
                     <p>Now in the next words, verse 18. <hi>For if the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance bee of the Law, it is no more of Promise: but God gave it to Abraham by Promise.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> The Apostle shewes, what the purpose of the Covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi> was, namely to give life and salvation by Grace and Promise, and therefore what the purpose of the latter covenant by <hi>Moses</hi> was not, neither could bee, namely to give the same life by working; since in those respects there would be contradiction and inconsistencie in the Covenants, and so by consequence instability and unfaithfulnesse in him that made them. The maine conclusion then which hitherto the Apostle hath driven at is this, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Law hath not voyded the promise, and that the Law is not of force towards the seede to whom the promise is made, in any such sense as carries contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto, and by consequence implyes abrogation of the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:16278:206"/>
Promise before made. Therefore if it be not to stand in a contradiction, it followes that it must in subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Gospell, and so to tend to Evangelicall purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>

same reason which compels men to come in, is requisite also to keepe them in; else why doth not God utterly destroy sinne in the Faithfull? Certainely hee hath no delight to see Christ have leprous members, or to see sin in his owne people. Only because he will still have them see the necessity of righteousnesse by faith, and of grace in Christ; he therfore suffers concupiscence to stirre in them, and the Law to conclude them under the curse. This then manifestly shewes that there was no other intention in publishing the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>with reference to the seede;</hi> that is, with <hi>Evangelicall purposes,</hi> to shew mercie: not with reference to those that perish, who would have had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation enough without the Law.</p>

                        <hi>the fire in the Mount,</hi> and this evidently declares that the Law was published in mercy and pacification, not in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or reveng<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s offended.) where as if the Lord had intended death in the publishing of the Law, hee would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed it in the hand of a Mediator, but of an Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner.</p>
                     <p>Verse 20. <hi>Now a Mediator is not a Mediator of one, but God is one.</hi>] Two expositions I conceive may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of these words, both which tend to cleare that use of the Law which wee are upon. First, where there is a Mediator there must be parties at variance that are two by their differences and disagreements, and not one.
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:16278:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This then shewes first for what reason the Law was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated, namely to convince men of their offences which had separated between them and God, who were at the first one in peace and mutuall affections towards each other. Secondly, the words following shew why the Law was published in the Hand of a Mediator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God is one: Though the law serve to convince men thus of their sinfull variance with God, yet they should not thereupon despaire, and sinke under the feare of his wrath: for as he made a Covenant of Promise to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his seede, so he is the same God still; <hi>One</hi> in his Grace and Mercy towards sinners; As a <hi>Mediator</hi> doth shew that men by sinne are at variance with God, so doth he shew likewise that God by Grace is at unitie with men. For when the party offended sends a mediator to him who had done the offence to parly and make tender of a reconcilement, two things doe herein manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. First, that before this there was a breach, or else there would have beene no neede of a Mediator. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that notwithstanding that breach, yet the party offended (from whom the Mediator comes) is at unitie and peace againe; so that though a mediator is not of one, but of disagreeing parties; yet God is one, that is, He, in sending this Mediator doth declare to mankinde, that Hee is at peace and unity with them againe, if they will accept of the reconcilement.</p>
                     <p>A second exposition may be thus. <hi>A Mediator is not of One.</hi> By <hi>One</hi> here may haply bee understood <hi>not one Party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> but <hi>one matter, businesse, or Covenant.</hi> And then the meaning runnes thus. As the Lord hath published <hi>Two Covenants, A Promise to Abraham,</hi> and a <hi>Law</hi> to Israel, so hee hath appointed <hi>Two Mediators</hi> of those covenants or businesses which hee had to communicate to men. <hi>Moses the Mediator</hi> of the Law (for <hi>the Law came by Moses;</hi>) and Christ the Mediator of the Promise or better covenant, (<hi>For Grace came by Iesus Christ</hi>)
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:16278:208"/>
                        <hi>Moses</hi> the representative, and Christ the substantiall and reall Mediator. But now though there be <hi>two Covenants,</hi> and <hi>two Mediators,</hi> and they so much in appearance contrary unto one another, as that God may in them seeme inconstant, and to have by one cancell'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented for the other: yet all this while <hi>God is One,</hi> that is, He is <hi>the same in both Covenants,</hi> carries the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and intention both in the Lawe and in the Gospell, namely a benevolence and desire of reconcilement with men.</p>
                     <p>Vers. 21. <hi>Is the Law then against the Promises of God? God forbid: for if there had beene a Law given which could have given Life, verily Righteousnesse should have beene by the Law.</hi>] Here wee have an Objection of the Iewes. If God be <hi>One,</hi> then Hee doth not speake one thing and meane another, pronounce the Law in some words, and require them to be otherwise understoode: And then it will follow that the Law is against the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> for in the common construct on and sense of the words it is manifestly contrary. This Objection the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth retort upon them. In as much as the Law would be against the Promise if it should stand for a <hi>rule of Iustification by it selfe,</hi> and not for a ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The substance and strength of the Apostles answer I take to be this. Contrariety is properly in the <hi>Nature</hi> of things considered <hi>by themselves.</hi> Now though there bee in the Law an <hi>accidentall contrariety</hi> to the Gospell by reason of the sinne of man which hath brought weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse upon it, so that the Law now curseth, and the Gospell blesseth; the Law now condemneth, and the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:16278:208"/>
Gospell justifieth; yet <hi>of it selfe it is not contrary.</hi> For if any Law would have given life and righteousnesse, this would have done it. That which is <hi>Ex se,</hi> considered <hi>in it selfe,</hi> Apt to carry to the same end whereunto another thing carries, is not of it selfe <hi>contrary</hi> thereunto: but the Law is of it selfe apt to carry unto Life and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as now the Gospel doth therefore of it selfe it is not contrary to the Gospell; but that difference which is, is from <hi>the sin of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And yet even thus the Law is not against the Promise: for the impossibilitie which we finde in the Law, enforceth us to bethinke our selves of a better and surer way to bring us unto righteousnesse and salvation. And this the Apostle shewes in the next words.</p>
                     <p>Vers. 22. <hi>But the Scripture hath concluded all under sinne, that the Promise by Faith of Iesus Christ might bee given to them that beleeve.</hi>] Though Sinne have made the Law contrary to the Promise, in that it curseth and condemneth, and concludeth men under sin and wrath: yet such is the mercy of God that he hath subordinated all this, and made it subservient unto the Gospell, that the Promise thereby may be applyed, and advanced. For it is all ordered to no other purpose but that men might
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:16278:209"/>
beleeve, and inherite the Promises. But what? Doth the Law make men beleeve, or beget Faith? <hi>Formally</hi> it doth not, but by way of <hi>preparation and manuduction</hi> it doth: As when a man findes one way shut up, he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by induc'd to enquire after another. To summe up all that hath beene spoken touching the use of the Law in a plaine similitude. Suppose wee a Prince should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime a pardon to all Traitors if they would come in and pleade it: and after this should send forth his officers to attach, imprison, examine, convince, arraigne, threaten, and condemne them. Is hee now contrary to himselfe? hath he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>epented of his mercy? No, but hee is unwilling to lose his mercie, hee is desirous to have the honour of his mercy acknowledged unto him; and therefore hee bringeth them unto these extremities, that when their mouth is stopp'd, and their guilt made evident, they may, with the more humilitie and abhorrencie of their former lewdnesse, acknowledge the Iustnesse of the Law, which would condemne them, and the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Prince, who hath given them liberty to plead his pardon. The same is the case betweene God and us. First, to <hi>Abraham</hi> he made promise of mercy and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse to all that would pleade interest in it for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of their sinnes. But men were secure, and heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of their estate, and though sinne was in them, and death raigned over them, yet being without a Law to evidence this sinne and death unto their consciences, therefore they imputed it not to themselves, they would not owne them, nor charge themselves with them, and by consequence found no necessity of pleading that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. Hereupon the Lord published by <hi>Moses</hi> a severe and terrible Law, so terrible that <hi>Moses himselfe did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly</hi>

vengeance then raigned in the World betweene <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> was no motive in Gods intention to publish the Law by his ministery, but onely the furtherance and advancement of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Law was not published by Moses on mount Sina (as it was given to Adam in Paradise) to iusti<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fie or to save men.</hi> God never appoints any thing to an end to which it is utterly unsurable and improper: Now<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.

And this the Law doth not by ingenerating or implanting lust in the heart, but by exciting, calling out, and occasioning that which was there before; as a chaine doth not beget any furie in a wolfe, nor a bridge infuse any strength into the water, nor the presence of an enemie instill or create <hi>de novo</hi> any malice in a man, but onely occasionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce unto Act, and call forth that rage which though lesse discerned, was yet habitually there before.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>the Law by accident doth punish and curse sinne.</hi> I say, <hi>by accident,</hi> because punishment is in no law the maine intention of the Lawgiver; but something ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereunto, to backe, strengthen, and enforce the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience which is principally intended. Neither could the Law have cursed man at all, if his disobedience had not thereunto made way; which shewes that the curse
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:16278:210"/>
was not the primary intention of the Law, but onely a secondary and subsequent act upon the failing of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall.

And this the Law doth, first, <hi>by convincing</hi> the Conscience of its owne widenes, (as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> speakes, <hi>I have seene an end of all perfection, but thy Law is exceeding broad.</hi>) By revealing the compasse of sinne in proportion to the widenesse, and the filthynesse of sin in proportion to the purity of that Holy Law; by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the depth and foulenesse, the deceitfulnesse and desperate mischiefe of the heart by nature; and giving some evidences to the soule of that horrid, endlesse, and insupportable vengeance which is due to sinne. <hi>We know</hi> saith the Apostle. <hi>that whatsoever things the Law saith, it saith to those that are under the Law; That every mouth may be stopped, and all the World may become guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>by awakening the Conscience,</hi> begetting <hi>a legall faith and spirit of bondage,</hi> to see it selfe thus miserable by the Law, <hi>hedged in with Thornes,</hi> and shut up under<note place="margin">Hos. 2. 6, 7.

the dispensation of the Law, that men may not thereby be exasperated, but put in minde of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to which they should flie. The heart of man is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as a flint, with a hard and a soft together: A Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and A Pillow is the best way to breake a flint; A Prison and a Pardon, A Scourge and a Salve, A Curse and a <hi>Saviour,</hi> is the best way to humble and convert a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. When wee convince the hearers that all the te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>rors we pronounce are out of compassion to them; that wee have mercy and balme in store to powre into every wound that we make, that all the blowes we give are not to kill their Soules, but their sins; that though our words bring fire and fury with them, yet they are still <hi>in the hand of a Mediator;</hi> that the Law is not to breake them unto desperation, but vnto humiliation, not to drive them unto furie but unto Faith, to shew them Hell indeede, but withall to keepe them from it; if we doe not by these meane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The people</hi> likewise should learne to rejoyce when the Law is preached as it was published; that is, when the Conscience is thereby affrighted, and made to tremble at the presence of God, and to cry unto the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator as the people did unto <hi>Moses, L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As the Law may be preached too much,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:16278:213"/>
when it is preached without the <hi>principall,</hi> which is the <hi>Gospell:</hi> so the Gospell and the mercie therein may bee preached too much (or rather indeede too little) because it is with lesse successe; If wee may call it preaching and not rather perverting of the Gospell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it is preached without the <hi>appendant,</hi> which is the <hi>Law.</hi>

A man will never die for modesty: when the Soule is convinc'd by the Law that it is accursed, and eternally lost, if it doe not speedily pleade Christs satisfaction at the Throne of Grace, it is emboldned to runne unto him: when it findes an issue of uncleanenesse upon it, it will set a price upon the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest thing about Christ, and be glad to touch the hemme of his garment.

                  <p>To consider more particular this <hi>Life</hi> which we have from <hi>Christ.</hi> First, It is a <hi>Life of Righteousnesse:</hi> for <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1. 17. 2. Cor. 3. 6, 7, 9. Rom. 5. 17, 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Righteousnes</hi> are in the Scripture taken for the same, (because sin doth immediatly make a man dead in law, <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 18.</note>

First, there is a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie</hi> and <hi>Deliverance</hi> wrought for us from that under which we were before held. Secondly, there is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> purchased for us, the Priviledge and Honour of being called the Sonnes of God conferr'd upon us. There are three Offices or Parts of the Mediation of Christ. First, his <hi>Satisfaction</hi> as hee is <hi>our</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 7. 22.</note>

For we must note that there are two things in the Law
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:16278:219"/>
intended; One <hi>principall, obedience,</hi> and another <hi>secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary, malediction,</hi> upon supposition of disobedience; so that sin being once committed, there must be a double act to justification, the suffering of the curse, and the fulfilling of righteousnesse a new. Vnto a double appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of Iustice in God there must answere a double act of righteousnesse in man, or in his surety for him; To Gods <hi>punishing Iustice</hi> a righteousnesse <hi>Passive,</hi> whereby a man is <hi>rectus in curia</hi> againe; and to Gods commanding <hi>Iustice</hi> a righteousnesse <hi>Active,</hi> whereby he is reconciled and made acceptable to God againe. The one a satisfaction for the injury we have done unto God as our Iudge; the other the performance of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which we owe unto him as our Maker. Secondly, In Christ as a Mediator, there is a <hi>merit</hi> likewise belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto both these acts of obedience in Him, by vertue of his infinite person which was the Priest, and of his Divine nature which was the Altar, that offered up and sanctified all his Obedience. By the redundancie of which Merit (after satisfaction thereby made unto His Fathers Iustice for our debt) there is further, a purchase made of Grace, and Glory, and of all good things in our behalfe. He was made of a <hi>woman,</hi> made under the law; First, <hi>toredeeme those that were under the Law,</hi> which is the <hi>satisfaction</hi> and payment He hath wrought. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>That we might receive the Adoption or the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of Sonnes,</hi> which is the <hi>Purchase</hi> He hath made for us. Thirdly, there is the <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ as our <hi>Advocate,</hi> which is the presenting of these his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits unto his Father for us, whereby He applyeth, and perpetuateth unto us the effects of them, namely our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and our Adoption or Inheritance. So then <hi>the life of righteousnesse</hi> consists in two things. First, <hi>The remission of sinne,</hi> and thereupon deliverance from the Guilt of it, and curse of the Law against it; which is an effect of the satisfaction of Christs Merit. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:16278:219"/>
                     <hi>Adoption,</hi> or the <hi>acceptation of our persons and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance</hi> into so high favour as to be heires of Salvation and Happinesse, which is the effect of the Redundancie of Christs Merit; there being a greater excesse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of vertue in his obedience, then of malignitie or unpleasingnesse in our disobedience.</p>
                  <p>To consider both these together; wee are <hi>delivered,</hi> First, from <hi>Sinne</hi> and the Guilt or Damnation thereof: There is <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus; their <note n="b" place="margin">Esai. 43 25.

                  <p>Secondly, wee are consequently delivered from the Law, so farre forth as it is the <note n="n" place="margin">1. Cor 15. 56.</note> strength of sinne; and are constituted under another and better regiment, which the Apostle calls <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note>

                  <p>Secondly, hereupon consequently wee are delivered from the <hi>rigor of the Law,</hi> which consisteth in two things: first it requireth <hi>perfect obedience:</hi> secondly,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>perpetuall obedience.</hi> Wee must doe all things that are written in the Booke of the Law, and we must continue to doe them. Now from this we are delivered, though not as a Dutie, yet as such a necessity as brings death upon the faile in it. When a mans conscience doth sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon him before Gods tribunall to bee justified or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;<note place="margin">Psal. 143. 2.</note> he dares not trust <note n="a" place="margin">Math 5. 48.</note> his owne performances, because no flesh can be righteous in Gods sight.

That inherent and habituall exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which the Law requireth in our persons in suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the merit of Christ: that actuall perfection which it requireth in our services, is supplyed by the incense, and intercession of Christ. And though wee are full of weaknesse, all our righteousnesse as a menstruous cloth, many ragges and remnants of the old <hi>Adam</hi> cleave still unto us, and we are kept under that captivitie and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydable service of sinne which hee sold us under: yet this <hi>Priviledge and Immunitie</hi> we have by Christ, that our desires are accepted, that God spareth us as Sonnes,<note place="margin">2.

                  <p>Lastly, we are hereupon consequently delivered from those <hi>effects of the spirit of bondage which come along with the Law.</hi> And they are principally three. First, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 7. 9.</note>

But this I can in truth of heart say, that I deny my owne workes, that I bewaile my corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the things which I doe I allow not, that it is no more I that doe them, but sinne that dwelleth in me; that I am truly willing to part from any lust, that I can heartily pray against my closest corruptions, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Law of God in mine inner man, that I am an unwilling captive to the Law in my members, that I feele, and cry out of my wretchednesse in this so una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydable subjection, that I desire to feare Gods Name, that I love the Communion of his Spirit and Saints; and I know I have none of these affections from nature (in that I agree with Sathan:) these are spirituall and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly impressions, and where there is a piece of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, where there is a little of heaven, that will undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly carry the soule in which it is to the place where all the Spirit is.

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath Life,</hi> in regard of <hi>Holinesse,</hi> as he hath <note n="g" place="margin">Col. 2. 6.</note> received <hi>Christ Iesus the Lord,</hi> so <hi>he walketh in Him:</hi>

                     <hi>we are in Him created or raised</hi> up from the first death, <hi>unto good workes,</hi> that we should walke in them. Of our selves we are <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 5. 6. 10.</note> without strength, without love, without <note n="k" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 1.</note> life; no power, no liking, no possibilitie to doe good; not any principle of Holynesse or Obedience in us. It is Hee that <note n="l" place="margin">Eph. 3. 16. Phil. 4. 13.</note> strengthens, that <note n="m" place="margin">Hos. 2. 14. Psal. 110. 3. 1.

                  <p>Wee should here consider <hi>Holinesse</hi> something more largely, and shew when good workes are <hi>Vitall,</hi> and so from Christ; and when onely <hi>mortall, earthly,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on false principles, and so from our selves. But having done this before in the doctrine of the raigne of sinne; I will onely name some other discourses of a <hi>Vitall Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and so proceede.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Life</hi> hath ever an <hi>Internall principle,</hi> a seede within it selfe, a naturall heate, with the fountaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <note n="o" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

Ioh. 3 9.</note> ingraffed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted seede, from the <note n="r" place="margin">Ier. 32. 40.</note> feare of God in the heart, and

the <note n="s" place="margin">Ier. 31. 33.</note> Law put into the inner man.

Fire when it prevailes will not be hidde nor kept in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Life</hi> hath ever a <hi>nutritive appetite</hi> ioyned with it, and that is most set upon such things as are of the <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. Arist. De Histor. Animal. lib. 8. cap. 1.</note> same matter and principles with the nature nourished: so where a man is by the spirit of Christ quickned unto a Life of Holynesse, he will have a <note n="b" place="margin">1. Pet 2. 2. Gen. 1. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>hungring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thirsting,</hi> and most ardent affection to all those sincere, uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Heavenly Truths, which are proportionable to that Spirit of Christ, which is in him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Life</hi> is <hi>Generative</hi> and <hi>Communicative</hi> of it selfe, all living Creatures have some seminarie of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for propagating their owne kinde; so that spirit of Holynesse which wee have from Christ, is a fruitfull spirit, that endeavours to shedde, multiply, and derive himselfe from one unto another. Therefore he descended in fiery tongues, to note this multiplying and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating property which he hath. The tongue is a member made for Communion, and nothing so generative of it selfe as fire. <hi>They that feared the Lord spake often to one</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 4. 16. Esai. 2. 3. Ier. 3. 3. 17.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, where there is perfect life, there is sense too of any violence offered to it: so where the Spirit of God is, will bee a tendernesse, and griefe from the sinnes, or temptations which doe assault him. As that great sinne, which the Scripture calls <hi>blaspheming of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and despighting of the Spirit of Grace, is after a more
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:16278:222"/>
especiall manner called <hi>the sinne against the Holy Ghost;</hi> as being a sinne which biddeth open defiance to the <hi>Truth, Grace, Life</hi> and <hi>Promises, which that Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth and confirmeth unto us;</hi> so every smaller sinne doth in its manner and measure grieve this spirit, even as every distemper in the body doth bring paine in some measure unto the naturall soule. A living member is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the smallest pricke, whereas a body in the Grave is not pained, nor disaffected with the weight and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the earth, the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>nesse, nor any violences of dissolution, because the principle ofsense is departed: so though wicked men lie in rotten and noysome lusts, have the guilt of many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of sinnes like so many rockes and mountaines of Lead on their soules, doe dayly cut and teare themselves like the Lunaticke in the Gospell, yet they feele nothing of all this, because they have no spirit of life in them: whereas another, in whom Christ is formed, would bee constrain'd with teares of blood, and most bitter repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to wash the wound of spirit, which but one of those fearefull oathes, or uncleane actions, (which the others multiply and wallow in with delight) would make within them.</p>
                  <p>Now, Hee who hath the Sonne, hath holynesse upon two grounds, according to that double relation which Holinesse hath unto Christ. For it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>respecteth Him as the <hi>Principle and Fountaine</hi> from whence it comes, and as the rule or patterne unto which it answeres. <hi>Holynes</hi> is called <hi>the Image of God;</hi> now as the face is both the Fountaine of that Image or species which is shed upon the glasse, and likewise the exact patterne and example of it too: so Christ is both the <hi>Principle of Holinesse,</hi> by whom it is wrought, and the <hi>Rule</hi> unto which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned.</p>
                  <p>First, Christ is the Principle and Fountaine of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as the head is of sense or motion; from him the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:16278:223"/>
whole body is joyned together and compacted, and so maketh encrease and edification of it selfe in Love. The oyntment ran downe from Aarons head unto the skirts of his garment, to note the effusion of the spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse from Christ unto his lowest members. <hi>Ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an unction from the holy One,</hi> saith the Apostle.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</note> What this influence of Christ into his members is wee shall more particularly open in the consequent parts of this discourse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Christ</hi> is the Rule and Patterne of holinesse to his Church. Our Sanctification consisteth onely in a conformitie unto his wayes. For more distinct under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of which point we must note, first, that <hi>Christ</hi> had severall waies and workes to walke through. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we finde him walking to Golgotha and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which was the worke of his merit and passion. Sometimes to the Mount with <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> which was the worke of his glory and trans-figuration. Sometimes upon the sea and through the midst of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which was his worke of power and miracles. Sometimes in the midst of the seven golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stickes, which was his worke of government, guidance, and influence on the Church. Lastly, we finde him go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, and doing good, submitting himselfe unto his parents, going apart by himselfe to pray, and in other the like workes of his ordinary obedience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, of these workes of <hi>Christ</hi> we must note, that some are uncommunicable, others communicable. Vncommunicable are, first, his workes of Merit and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation. There is but one Mediator betweene God and man, the man <hi>Christ.</hi> There is no other name under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by which a man may be saved, but the name of <hi>Christ.</hi> There is no Redemption nor intercession to bee wrought by any man but by <hi>Christ.</hi> None have to doe with the Censer to offer incense, who have not to doe with the Altar to offer Sacrifice. Secondly, his worke
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:16278:223"/>
of Governement and Influence into the Church, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing of the spirit, his quickning of his Word, his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of his enemies, his collecting of his members, are all personall Honours which belong unto Him as Head of the Church. Those which are <hi>Communicable,</hi> and wherein wee may be by his Grace made partakers, are such as either belong to the other life, or to this. In the<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21. 1.

Here, some are againe extraordinarily <hi>Communicable,</hi> being for ministery and service, not for sanctity or Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such were the miraculous workes of the Apostles, which were unto them by way of priviledge and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary dispensation granted.

So then it remaines that <hi>our formall and complete Sanctification</hi> consists in a <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to the wayes of Christs ordinary Obedience.</hi> The whole Life of Christ was a Discipline, a Living, Shining, and exemplary Precept unto men, a Visible <hi>Commentary on Gods Law.</hi> Therefore wee finde such names given unto Him in the Scriptures, as signifie not onely Preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, but exemplarynesse; A <note n="a" place="margin">Dan. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Now further this conformity unto <hi>Christ</hi> must be in all his obedience. First, in his actiue obedience unto the Law, <note n="n" place="margin">Matt 11. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Learne of me,</hi> saith he, <hi>for I am meeke and lowly.</hi>

                     <hi>Let the same minde,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>be in you, which was in Christ,</hi> that is, have the same judgement, opinions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, compassions, as <hi>Christ</hi> had. <note n="q" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Secondly, in his passive obedience, though not in the end or purposes, yet in the manner of it, <hi>Runne with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>the race which is set before you,</hi> looking vnto <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 12. 1, 2.</note>

The head doth not thinke all its worke ended when it is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten through it selfe, but taketh care, and is mindefull of the members that follow. Therefore the Apostle cals our sufferings A fulfilling or <note n="s" place="margin">Col. 1. 24.</note> making up of the sufferings of Christ.

                  <p>But heere it may be objected, <hi>Christ</hi> was Himselfe voluntarily poore; <note n="t" place="margin">2. Cor 8. 9. Luk. 9. 58. Luk. 8. 3. Mark. 10. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Hee became poore for our sakes,</hi> and he commanded poverty to the young man, <hi>goe sell all that thou hast, and give it to the poore.</hi> Is every man to be herein a follower of Christ? To this I answere in generall, that poverty was not in Christ any act <hi>of Morall Obedience,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> to the yong man any command of <hi>Morall Obedience.</hi> First, for Christs poverty we may conceive that it was a requisite preparatorie act to the worke of redemption, and to the magnifying of his spirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the subduing of his enemies, and saving of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; when it appeared that thereunto no externall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions nor contribution of temporall greatnesse did concurre. And secondly for the command to the yong man, it was meerely personall, and indeede not so much intending obedience to the letter of the precept, as triall of the sinceritie of the mans former profession, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of him touching those misperswasions and selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceits which made him trust in himselfe for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse like that of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his Sonne, which was not intended for death to <hi>Isaake,</hi> but for tryall to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and for manifestation of his faith.</p>
                  <p>It may be further objected, <hi>How can wee bee Holy, as Christ is Holy?</hi> First the thing is impossible, and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we could, there would be no neede of Christ; if we were bound to bee so Holy, righteousnesse would come
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:16278:225"/>
by a Law of workes. To this I answere; the Law is not nullyfied, nor curtall'd by the mercy of Christ: we are as fully bound to the obedience of it as <hi>Adam</hi> was, though not upon such bad termes, and evill consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as he; under danger of contracting sinne, though not under danger of incurring death. So much as any justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied person comes short of complete and universall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, so much hee sinneth, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, though God be pleased to pardon that sinne by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ. Christ came to deliver from sinne, but not to priviledge any man to commit it: though hee came to be a curse for sinne, yet Hee came not to be a Cloake for sinne. Secondly, <hi>Christ is needefull in two respects:</hi> First, because we cannot come to full and perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and so His Grace is requisite to pardon and cover our failings: Secondly, because that which wee doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unto, is not of or from our selves, and so his spirit is requisite to strengthen us unto his service. Thirdly, when the Scripture requires us to be Holy and perfect <hi>as Christ and God,</hi> by as, we understand not equalitie in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, but qualitie in the Truth of our Holynesse: As when the Apostle saith, <hi>That we must love our neighbour</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom 13. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>as our selves,</hi> the meaning is not that <hi>our love to our neighbour should be mathematically equall to the love of our selves;</hi> for the Law doth allow of degrees in Love according to the degrees of relation and neerenesse in<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> the thing loved: <hi>Doe good unto all men, specially to those of the houshold of Faith.</hi> Love to a friend may safely bee<note place="margin">Rom. 12 9.</note> greater then to a stranger; and to a wife or childe, then to a friend: yet in all, our love to others must be of the selfe same nature, as true, reall, cordiall, sincere, solid as that to our selves. Wee must love our neighbour as wee doe our selves, that is, unfainedly, and without dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Let vs further consider the <hi>Grounds</hi> of this point tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>Conformitie</hi> which is betweene the <hi>nature and</hi>

                     <hi>spirituall life of Christians and of Christ</hi> (because it is a Doctrine of principall consequence.) First this was one of the <hi>Ends of Christs comming.</hi> Two purposes He came for; A restitution of us to our interest in Salvation, and a restoring our originall qualities of Holynesse unto vs. Hee came to sanctifie, and cleanse the Church, that it <hi>should be Holy and without blemish; unblameable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproveable</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 26. Col. 1. 22. Tit. 2. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>in his sight: To Redeeme, and to purifie his people. The one is the worke of his Merit which goeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Satisfaction of his Father;</hi> the other the worke of his Spirit and Grace, which goeth downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Sanctification of his Church. In the one He bestoweth his righteousnesse upon us by imputation; in the other He fashioneth his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But if Christ be not onely a <hi>Saviour to Redeeme,</hi> but <hi>a Rule to Sanctifie,</hi> what use or service is left unto the Law? I answere, that the <hi>Law</hi> is still a <hi>Rule,</hi> but not a comfortable, effectuall, delightfull rule without Christ applying, and sweetning it unto us. The <hi>Law</hi> onely comes with commands, but <hi>Christ</hi> with strength, love, willingnesse, and life to obey them. The <hi>Law</hi> alone comes like a <hi>Schoolemaster</hi> with a scourge, a curse along with it; but when <hi>Christ</hi> comes with the <hi>Law,</hi> He comes as a <hi>Father,</hi> with precepts to teach, and with compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to spare. The Law is a Lion, and <hi>Christ our Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> that slew the Lion; as long as the Law is alone, so long it is alive, and comes with terrour, and fury upon every Soule it meetes: but when Christ hath slaine the Law, taken away that which was the strength of it, namely the guilt of sinne, then there is honie in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">a Math. 11. 30.

                  <p>Fourthly Holynesse in the Scripture is called an <hi>Vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> All the vessels of the Tabernacle were sanctified by that Holy <hi>Vnction</hi> which was prescribed <hi>Moses.

                  <p>Now for our further applycation of this Doctrine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>use</hi> and <hi>practise:</hi> we may hence first receive a <hi>twofold Instruction.</hi> First, touching the <hi>proportions</hi> wherein our holynesse must beare <hi>conformitie unto Christ;</hi> for <hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie</hi> cannot be without <hi>proportion.</hi> Here then we may observe foure particulars wherein our holynesse is to bee proportionable unto Christs. First, it must have <hi>the same principle and seed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> with Christs,</hi> namely his Spirit. As in Christ there were two natures, so in either nature there was Holynesse after a severall manner. In his Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was holy by essence and underivatively<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in His humane by consecration, and unction with the Spirit; and in this wee are to beare proportion unto him. Our holynesse must proceede from the same Spirit whereby he was sanctified; onely with this difference. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Holynesse was Christs, <hi>Inr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> proprio,</hi> by vertue of the <hi>by postaticall union</hi> of the humane nature with the divine in the unitie of his person. By meanes whereof it was impossible for the humane nature in him not to bee san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and filled with Grace. But to us the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:16278:228"/>
by an inferior union unto Christ as our Head, from whom it is unto us derived and dispensed in such propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as Hee is in mercy pleased to observe towards his members. But yet though wee have not as Hee a pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Spirit, yet wee have the same in Truth and substance with Him. As it is the same light which brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth forth in the dawning of the day, and inhereth in the Glorious body of the Sunne, though here in fulnesse, and there but in measure: So the Apostle saith we are all<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 18. 1. Cor 6. 17. Eph. 4. 4.</note> changed into the same Image with Christ by the Spirit of our God. And he that is ioyned unto the Lord is one spirit, and that there is but <hi>one Body and one Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and his members.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, our Holynesse must bee conformable to Christs in the <hi>Ends of it.</hi> First, <hi>the Glory of God:</hi> Father,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 4.</note> saith hee, <hi>I have gloryfied thee on earth, I have finished the worke which thou gavest me to doe.</hi> Wherein there are three notable things for our imitation First that God must first give us our workes, before we must doe them. We must have his warrant and authoritie for all we doe. If a man could bee so full of <hi>selfe-zeale</hi> (if I may so call it) of <hi>irregular and unprescribed devotion,</hi> as to offer <hi>rivers of oyle, or mountaines of cattell, or the first borne of his body for the sinne of his soule,</hi> should neglect and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate<note place="margin">Mic. 6. 7, 8. Col 2. 23.</note> his body and dishonour his flesh into the gastly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and image of a dead carcasse; yet if the Lord have not first shewed it, nor required it of him, it will all prove but the vanitie, and pride of a fleshly minde. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 18.</note> as wee must doe nothing but that which God requires, and gives us to doe, so we must therein aime at<note place="margin">Ioh 4. 34. Heb. 6. 6.</note> his Glory; as his Authoritie must bee the ground, so his Honour must be the End of all our workes: and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>God is never glorified, but by finishing His workes.</hi> To beginne, and then fall backe, is to put Christ to shame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, all Christs workes were done for <hi>the good of the Church. He was given and borne for us. He was made</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esai. 9. 6.</note>
                     <pb n="421" facs="tcp:16278:228"/>
                     <hi>sinne and curse for us.</hi> For our righteousnesse and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">2. Cor 5. 21. Ioh 16. 7.</note> he came, and for our expediencie he returned againe. When the Apostle urgeth the Philippians <hi>not to looke to their owne things, but every man also on the things of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 4. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>others,</hi> hee presseth them with this argument, <hi>Let the same minde bee in you which was in Christ Iesus. Hee thought it no robbery to be equall with God,</hi> and therefore to him there could be no accession; all that he did was<note place="margin">vers. 17.</note> for his Church; and this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sealeth with his owne example: <hi>If I be offered upon the sacrifice and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of your faith, I ioy and reioyce with you all.</hi> And else<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 15.</note> where, <hi>I will very gladly spend and be spent for you, though the more aboundantly I love you, the lesse I beloved.</hi> One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here is the difference, Christs obedience was <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> for the redemption of His Church, ours onely <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall</hi> for the edification of the Church: we doe all things, saith the Apostle, for your edification. When the<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 19. Col. 1. 24.</note> Apostle saith, <hi>I fill up that which is behinde of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of Christ for his Bodies sake, which is the Church:</hi> We are not to conceive it in our adversaries glosse, that it was to merit, expiate, satisfie for the Church; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to benefit and edifie it. Let him expound himselfe.<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 12. 13. 2. Tim. 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>The things which happened vnto mee, namely my bonds in Christ, have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospell:</hi> and againe, <hi>I endure all things for the Elects sake, that they may also obtaine the Salvation, not which my sufferings merit, but which is in Christ Iesus.</hi> To note that the sufferings of the Saints are <hi>ministerially</hi> service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Salvation of the Church, unto which the sufferings of Christ are alone <hi>meritorious</hi> and availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our holinesse must bee <hi>Proportionable</hi> to Christs in the <hi>parts of it.</hi> It must be <hi>universall:</hi> the whole<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16.</note> man must bee spiritually formed and organiz'd unto the measure of Christ. Every part must have its measure, and every ioynt its supply. Holynesse is a <hi>resurrection;</hi>
                     <pb n="422" facs="tcp:16278:229"/>
all that which fell must be restored; and it is a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all the parts of him that begetteth must be fashioned. <hi>The God of peace sanctifie you throughout, and I pray God that your whole spirit, soule and body may bee preserved blamelesse unto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>our Holinesse must bee proportion ed unto Christ in the manner of working:</hi> I shall observe but three<note place="margin">Math. 16. 24.</note> particulars of many. First, it must be done with <hi>selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyall;</hi> He that will follow Christ must deny himselfe: Christ for us denyed himselfe, and his owne will; His naturall love towards his owne life yeelded to his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full love towards his members; not as I will in my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall desire to decline dissolution, but as thou wilt in thy mercifull purpose to save thy Church. Many men will be content to serve God as long as they may with all advantage themselves: but to serve him and deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves is a worke which they have not learned. <hi>Ephraim</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 10. 11. 1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>loveth to treade out the corne,</hi> saith the Prophet. You know the mouth of the Oxe was not to be muzled that trod out the corne, he had his worke and reward toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But plowing is onely in hope: for the present it is a hungry and a hard worke. So, saith he, while <hi>Ephraim</hi> may serve me and himselfe, make religion serve his other secular purposes, he will be very forward: but when he must plow, that is, serve in hope of a Harvest, but in paine for the present, hee hath an easier plow going of his owne, as it followes, <hi>ye have plowed wickednesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it must bee done in <hi>obedience</hi> unto God.<note place="margin">Phil 2. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ioh. 4 34. Heb. 1. 9.</note> Christ emptied himselfe, and became obedient; It was his meate and drinke to doe the Will of his Father: even unto that bitter worke of his Passion he was annointed with the <hi>oyle of gladnesse;</hi> to note that though as made of a woman, partaker of the same passions and naturall affections with us, hee did decline it, and shrinke from it; yet, as made under the Law, hee did most voluntarily and obediently undertake it. <hi>Thou hast prepared mee a</hi>

                     <hi>bodie. In the volume of thy booke it is written of me, Lo I come to doe thy Will O God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, our holynesse must have <hi>growth and proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> with it, grow in grace. Let these things be in you and abound; as it is said of Christ, that <hi>He increased in wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 2 40. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>2. Heb. 5. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>and favour with God and men,</hi> and that <hi>He learned obedience by the things which Hee suffered.</hi> If it bee here objected, that Christ was ever full, and had the Spirit without measure even from the wombe; For in as much as his Divine nature was in his infancie as fully united to his humane as ever after, therefore the fulnesse of grace, which was a consequent thereupon, was as much as ever after: To this I answere, that certaine it is Christ was <hi>ever full of Grace and Spirit;</hi> but that excludes not his growth in them, proportionably to the ripenesse, and by consequence capacitie of his humane nature. Suppose<note place="margin">Uid. Cameron. de Eccles pag. 152.</note> we the Sunne were vegetable and a subject of augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, though it would be never true to say that it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of light then it was, yet it would be true to say that it hath more light now, then it had when it was of a lesser capacitie: Even so Christ being in all things save sinne like unto us, and therefore like us in the degrees and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses of naturall maturitie, though he were ever full of Grace, may yet be said to grow in it, and to learne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as the capacitie of his nature was enlarged, the spring of Grace within him did rise up and proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fill it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from this Doctrine of our conformity in Holinesse to the life of Christ we may be instructed tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the vigor of the Law, and the consonancie and concurrencie thereof with the Gospell. True it is that <hi>Christ is the End of the Law,</hi> and <hi>that wee are not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> Yet it is as true that <hi>Christ came not to destroy the Law, and that no jot nor tittle thereof shall fall to the ground.</hi> Wee are not under the Law for <hi>Iustification</hi> of our persons, as <hi>Adam;</hi> nor for
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:16278:230"/>
                     <hi>satisfaction</hi> of Divine Iustice, as those that perish; but we are under it as a <hi>document of obedience,</hi> and a <hi>rule</hi> of living. It is now published from mount Sion, as a Law of libertie, and a new Law; not as a Law of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and bond age. The obedience thereof is not removed, but the disobedience thereof is both pardoned and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Necessarie is the observation of it as as a fruite of Faith, not as a condition of Life or Righteousnesse, Necessarie, <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> as a thing commanded, the transgressing whereof is an incurring of sinne; not <hi>necessitate medy,</hi> as a strict and undispensable meane of Salvation, the transgression whereof is a peremptorie obligation unto death. Three things Christ hath done to the Law for us. First, He hath mitigated the <hi>rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>r</hi> and removed the <hi>curse</hi> from it, as it is a killing letter, and ministery of death. Secondly, Hee hath by his Spirit conferred all the <hi>principles of obedience</hi> upon us; wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to contrive, will to desire, strength to execute, love to delight in the services of it. The Law onely commands, but Christ enables. Thirdly, Hee hath by his exemplary holinesse chalked out unto us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us in the way of obedience: for all our obedience comes from Christ, and that either as unto <hi>members</hi> from his <hi>Spirit,</hi> or as unto <hi>Disciples</hi> from his <hi>Doctrine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi> We see then the necessitie of our being in Christ, not onely for righteousnesse, but for obedience: for we must have <hi>Life,</hi> before we can have <hi>Operation. If we live</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>in the spirit, let us walk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> also in the spirit.</hi> Whereas out of Christ a man is under the whole Law, as an insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table yoke, as an impossible and yet inexorable rule; as a Covenant of Righteousnesse, and condition by which he must be tried, by which he must everlastingly stand or fall before the tribunall of Christ, when he shall come in flaming fire to take vengeance on those who, though convinced of their iusufficiencie to observe the Law, have yet disobeyed the Gospell of our Lord Iesus Christ.
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:16278:230"/>
Thirdly we may hence learne the necessitie of diligent attendance on the holy Scriptures and places where they are explained: there is <note n="a" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2 6.</note> no abiding in Christ but by walking as he walked: there is no walking as hee wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but by knowing how he walked: and this is onely by the Scriptures, in which Hee is <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 28. 20.</note> yet amongst us, <note n="c" place="margin">Revel. 1 13.</note> walking in the middest of his Church, <note n="d" place="margin">Gal 3. 1.</note> Crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, set forth and <note n="e" place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 2, 3.</note> declared unto us: <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 20. 30. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>many other signes Iesus did which are not written</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>but these are written that you might beleeve, and that beleeving you might have life.</hi> Wee know not any of Christs wayes or workes but by the Word; and therefore they who give no attendance unto that, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they regard not the wayes of Christ, nor have any care to follow the Lambe wheresoever he goeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must from hence bee <hi>exhorted</hi> to take heede of usurping Christs honour to our selves, of being our <hi>owne rule</hi> or way. The Lord is a jealous God, and will not suffer any to bee a selfe mover, or a God unto himselfe. It is one of Gods extreamest judgements to give men over to themselves, and leave them to follow their owne rules. When hee hath first wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to the Spirit of Grace, this is the judgement with which God useth to revenge the quarrrell of his Grace and Covenant, to leave them to the hardnesse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 14. 16.</note>

                     <hi>and Israel would none of me.

<pb n="427" facs="tcp:16278:231"/>

                  <p>What ever action therefore you goe about, doe it by <hi>Rule,</hi> enquire out of the scriptures whether Christ would have done it or no, at least whether he allow it or no. It is true, somethings are lawfull and expedient with us, which were not suteable unto the person of Christ. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is honourable with all other men, but it did not befit his person who came into the world to spirituall purposes onely, to beget sonnes and daughters unto God, and to be mystically married unto his Church. To write bookes is commendable with men, because like <hi>Abel</hi> being dead they may still speake, and teach those who never saw them. But it would have beene derogatory to the person, and unbecomming the office of Christ. For it is his prerogative to bee in the midst of the seven candlestickes, to be present to all his members, to teach by power and not by ministery, to teach by his Spirit,<note place="margin">Cathedram in coelis habet, qui Corda docet.</note> and not by his penne, to teach the hearts of men, and not their eyes or eares. He hath no mortalitie, distance, or absence to be by such meanes supplyed. It became him to commit these ministeriall actions to his servants, and to reserve to himselfe that great honour of writing his Law in the hearts of his people, and making them to be his epistle. But yet I say as in these things wee must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect his <hi>allowance,</hi> so in others let us ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Did Christ frequently pray both with his Disciples, and alone by himselfe, and shall Inever either in my family or in my closet thinke upon God? did Christ open his wounds, and shall not I open my mouth? was not his blood too pretious to redeeme, and is my breath too good to instruct his Church? was Christ mercifull to his enemies, and shall I bee cruell to his members? Againe for the manner of Christs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; did Christ serve God without all selfe-ends, meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in obedience, and to glorifie him; and shall I make Gods worship subordinate to my aimes and his religion serve turnes? shall I doe what I doe without any love or ioy, meerely out of slavish feare, and compulsion of conscience? Thus if we did resolve our services into their true originals, and measure them by the Holynesse of Christ, and have him ever before our eyes, it would be a great meanes of living in comfort and spirituall confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to Gods Law.</p>
                  <p>And there are, amongst diverse others, two great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements thereunto. First, while we follow Christ wee are out of all danger, his Angels have us in their armes, we are under the protection of his promises, as every good subject in the kings way is under the kings protection. <hi>Peter</hi> never denyed Christ, nor was assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 54, 55, 56.</note> by the servants of the high priest till hee gave over following him. Secondly, the more wee follow Christ the neerer still we come unto him. Because Christ is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into his rest, he is now at home, hee is not now in motion, but he sitteth still at his Fathers right hand, and hath no higher nor no further to goe: and therefore so long as I hasten and presse forward in his way, I must needes be the neerer unto him. <hi>Your Salvation is neerer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 11.</note>

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a man will say, how shall I doe to follow Christ?<note place="margin">Math. 16. 24.</note> I answere in one word, <hi>denie thy selfe, and thou dost then follow him:</hi> get out of thine owne way and thou canst not misse of his. The world never rules us but by our<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 4. 5. 1. Ioh. 2. 16, 17. Iam. 4 7.</note> owne lusts; Sathan never overcomes us but by our owne willes, and with our owne weapons; when he is resisted hee flyes. As <hi>Hanibal</hi> was wont to say that the onely way to fight against Rome was in Italie: so the other enemies of our salvation know that there is no conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the soule but in its owne waye. As soone as any man forsakes his owne way, Christ is at hand to lead him into his. He will bee <hi>wisedome</hi> to those that denie their owne reason; he will be <hi>Redemption</hi> to those that despise their owne merits; hee will bee <hi>sanctification</hi> to those that cast of their owne lusts; hee will be <hi>salvation</hi> to those that relinquish their owne ends; he will be all things to those that are nothing to themselves. Now we have (as I may so speake) <hi>two selfes. A selfe of nature, and a selfe of sinne;</hi> and both must be denyed for Christ. This wee must ever cast away as a <hi>snare,</hi> and that wee must be ever ready to lay downe, as a <hi>sacrifice,</hi> when he is pleased to set himselfe in competition with it. And so much for the Life of Holynesse which wee have in Christ.</p>

                  <p>And now having unfolded this <hi>threefold Life</hi> which the faithfull have in <hi>Christ,</hi> wee may further take notice of <hi>three attributes or properties</hi> of this life, both to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and to secure us; and they are all couched in one word of the Apostle, <hi>your life is hid with Christ in God.</hi>

                     <hi>Godlynesse a Mysterie.</hi> As there is a mysterie of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the hidden things of uncleannesse: so there is a <hi>Mysterie of Godlynesse,</hi> and the <note n="b" place="margin">1.

Secondly, It is hid in some sort from the faithfull themselves. First, under the prevalencie of their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and adherencie of concupiscence, as Corne under a heape of chaffe, or a wall under the Ivie, or mettall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rust which overgrowes it. Secondly, under the winnowings and temptations of Satan. As in sifting of Corne the branne being lightest gets upmost, so when Satan disquiets the heart, that which is finest, and should most comfort, will sinke and bee out of sight. Thirdly, under spirituall desertions, and trials; as in an Eclipse, when the face of the Sunne is intercepted, the Moone looseth her light: so when God, who is our light, hideth his Countenance from us, no marvell if we can discover no good nor comfort in our selves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>life of glorie</hi> is much more <hi>obscure</hi> and secret; for notwithstanding the first fruites and inchoati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof bee in this life begun in the peace of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and joy in the Holy Ghost (as in an Eclipse of the Sunne some dimme glimpses doe glance from the edges of the interposed body) yet in regard of the plenarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of glorious endowments, and those prerogatives of the flesh which belong unto it at the redemption of the bodie, it is a hidden mysterie; It is a <hi>light which is</hi>

                     <hi>onely sowed</hi> for the righteous; though we expect a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, yet now it is but as corne in the ground, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with much darknesse. <hi>Now we are Sonnes,</hi> saith<note place="margin">1.

understand the excellencie of our inheritance by these seales and assurances which ratifie our right thereunto, then one who never saw the Sunne could conjecture the light and lustre thereof by the twinckling of a litle starre, or the picture thereof in a table; Onely this wee know, <hi>that when he shall appeare, wee shall be like unto him;</hi> not onely in <hi>true holynesse,</hi> for so we are like him now (wee are already <hi>created after him in righteousnesse and true holynesse</hi>) but in <hi>full holynesse</hi> too; we shall be filled with<note place="margin">Eph 4. 24.

Eph. 4 30.</note> all the <hi>fulnesse of God,</hi> as the same Apostle speakes: Such a fulnesse as shall satisfie us: <hi>when I awake I shall bee satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thy likenesse.</hi> Therefore the last day is by an emphasis called a <hi>Day of redemption.</hi> First, in regard of the <hi>manifestation</hi> and Revelation thereof. The Lord shal then appeare and bee revealed from Heaven, all those curtens shall bee drawne, those vailes betweene us and our Glory, those skinnes with which the Arke is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid, shall be torne and removed: our sinnes, our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condition, our manifold afflictions, the seeming po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie and foolishnesse of the ordinances, shall be all laid aside, and then wee shall see our Redeemer, not as <hi>Iob</hi> did from a dunghill, nor as <hi>Moses</hi> through a Cloude, but we shall know <hi>even as we are knowne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then wee see one of the maine reasons why wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men despise religion, and <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 29. 27.</note> abominate the righteous, as <note n="b" place="margin">Esai. 8. 14, 18. Zach. 3. 8. Psal. 71. 7.</note> signes and wonders to bee spoken against. They judge of Spiritual things as blind men do of colors. These are hidden mysteries to them, no marvell if they count it a strange thing, and a very madnesse that others runne not to their excesse. But our comfort is that our hope is <hi>Germen,</hi> a growing thing, a stone full of eyes, <hi>a hidden Manna,</hi> (sweete though secret) a new name, which<note place="margin">Revel. 2. 17.</note> though no other man can know, yet he that receiveth it is able to reade.</p>
                  <p>And this is the reason too why the Saints themselves are not enough affected with the beautie of Holynesse,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:16278:235"/>
because it is in great part hidden even from them by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and admixture of earthly lusts. <hi>Lift up your</hi>

                     <hi>heads,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>for your redemption draweth nigh:</hi> noting unto us, that so long as the thoughts and affections of men are downeward, their redemption is out of their sight. <hi>Open thou mine eyes,</hi> saith <hi>David, that</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 18, 19</note> 
                     <hi>I may behold the wondrous things out of thy Law: I am a stranger on earth, O hide not thy Commandements from me.</hi> When a man makes himselfe a stranger unto earthly things, and setteth not any of his choisest affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and desires on them, he is then qualified to see those mysteries and wonders which are in the Law. If there were no earth, there would bee no darknesse (for the shadow of the earth is that which makes the night, and the bodie of the earth which absenteth the Sunne from our view) It is much more certaine in spirituall things, the light of Gods Word and Graces would not bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed, if earthly affections did not interpose themselves. This is the reason why men goe on in their sinnes and beleeve not the Word, because they have a vaile over their eyes, which hides the beautie of it from them. <hi>Who</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esai. 53. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>hath beleeved our report, or to whom is the arme of the Lord revealed?</hi> saith the Prophet: intimating unto us, that the Word will not be beleeved, till it bee revealed.<note place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord opened the heart of Lydia to attend unto Pauls</hi> preaching. As soone as the vaile is taken away by Christ, and the Truth, Goodnesse, and beautie of the Gospell discover'd, there is immediately wrought a cleare assent and subscription in the minde, an earnest longing and desire in the heart, a constant purpose and resolution in the will to forsake all things as dung in comparison of that excellent knowledge. As in the discoverie of mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall conclusions there is such demonstrative and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible evidence as would make a man wonder he had not understood them before: so in the discoveries of Grace unto the Soule, the Spirit doth so throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:16278:236"/>
a man, that hee wonders at his former stupiditie, which never admired such things before.</p>
                  <p>Againe the faithfull are here to be directed in this state of obscuritie how to carry themselves under those cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, temptations, desertions, which here hide the brightnesse and beautie of their life from them. First, above all preserve sinceritie in the heart. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in us so perfect, so contrarie to our corruptions as sinceritie; that will ever bee to the soule in the midst of darknesse as a chinke in a Dungeon, through which it may discerne some glimmerings of light; whereas with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it all other shewes and pretences are but like win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes fastned upon a thicke wall onely for uniformitie in the building; though they seeme specious to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder without, yet inward they transmit no light at all, because they are laid over an opace body. Secondly, foster not temptations, doe not pleade nor promote the Divels cause, set not forward thine enemies suggestions. Though it bee our dutie to have our sinnes alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, so it bee upon the suggestion and proposall of Gods Spirit; yet we must turne our eyes from our very sinnes when Sathan displayes them. Christ will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, but hee forbids the Divels to confesse him; and God will have sinne to be felt and seene, but as a dutie, not as a temptation; in his owne Word, not in Satans false glasses; to draw us unto him, not to drive or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre us from him. When the spirit convinceth of sinne, it is to amend us; but when Satan doth it, it is onely to affright and confound us. And commonly hee drives to one sinne, to cover another. Againe the spirit opens sinne in the soule as a Chirurgian doth a wound, in a close roome, with fire, friends, and remedies about him: but the divell first draw's a man from the Word, from Christ, from the promises, and then strips the soule, and opens the wounds thereof in the cold aire onely to kill and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to cure or releeve. In such a case therefore the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:16278:236"/>
Soule should lay the faster hold upon Christ, and when there is no light should trust upon the name of the Lord and stay upon his God. Thirdly, In spirituall desertions exercise faith to see God when Hee is absent: goe into the watch Tower, review thine owne and other mens experiences of Gods dealing; resolve to trust him though he kill thee; resolve to cleave to him, as <hi>Elisha</hi> to <hi>Eliah,</hi> though he offer to depart from thee; resolve to venture upon him when he seemes angrie and arm'd against thee; resolve to runne after him when hee hath forsaken thee; endure rather his blowes, then his absence; therefore he removes that thou shouldst crie after him; therefore he hides from thee, not that thou shouldst lose him, but onely that thou shouldest seeke him: And there is most <hi>comfort in a life recovered.</hi> Difficulties sweeten our fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition; and there is a fulnesse in Chtist which will at last be an ample reward of all preceding discomforts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the life which we have by Christ is a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and aboundant life. <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>I am come,</hi> saith he, <hi>that they might have Life, and that they might have it more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 7. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>Hee that beleeveth on mee, out of his bellie shall flow rivers of living water,</hi> like the <note n="c" place="margin">Ezek. 47. 3. 4. 5.</note> waters of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> vision which swelled from the ancles to the loynes, and from thence to an unpassable Streame. So the Apostle saith, that the Lord had <note n="d" place="margin">Tit. 3. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>shed forth the spirit aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly</hi> in the renewing of his Saints. And it is an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which you may easily make, that sundrie times in the Apostles writings, the Graces of the Gospell are called the <note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 1. 7. 2. 7. 3. 8. Col 1. 27. Heb. 11. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>riches of Christ,</hi> and the riches of his Grace, and the riches of his mysterie, and the riches of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the riches of his reproaches, and the <note n="f" place="margin">Math. 12. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>treasure of a good heart;</hi> By all which is expressed the <hi>pretiousnes,</hi> and the <hi>aboundance</hi> of the Spirit which wee have from the Life of Christ. Therefore the Spirit is compared unto <note n="g" place="margin">Esai. 12 3. Ioh 7. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>water,</hi> and that not onely to sprinkle and bedew men, but to wash and baptise them; <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 1. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>ye shall be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>
                     <pb n="438" facs="tcp:16278:237"/>
                     <hi>with the Holy Ghost.</hi> As water knowes no bounds within it selfe, is onely limited by the vessell which holds it; so the Spirit is of a very spreading and unlimited pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie it selfe, and is onely straitned by the narrownesse of those hearts unto which it comes. <note n="i" place="margin">2. Cor 6. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Yee are not strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in us,</hi> saith the Apostle, or in our ministery, wee preach aboundance of Grace unto you; but <hi>ye are strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in your owne bowels;</hi> you are like narrow mouthed vessels; though floudes of knowledge, fall downe, (<note n="k" place="margin">Esai 11 9.</note> 
                     <hi>The Earth shall bee full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea,</hi>) yet but drops fall in. This is a great grieving of the Spirit of Life, and indignitie done to the springing and abounding vertue which he brings, for us by our supinnes and securitie to damme up this fountaine, to let this garden of spices be over growne with weedes; to nippe, stifle, and keepe under the Graces of Christ; not to receive a proportionable measure of growth to those meanes, and influences which hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the <hi>Life</hi> which we have from <hi>Christ</hi> is a <hi>Safe,</hi> an <hi>Abiding,</hi> an <hi>Eternall Life:</hi> the longer it continues, the more it aboundes. It is such a life as runnes not into death. Our earthly life is indeede but a dying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying life: but our Spirituall life is a <hi>growing life.</hi> It is called in the Scripture our <hi>abiding in Christ,</hi> to note that our estate in him is a fixed, constant and secure estate.</p>
                  <p>Life can End in Death but upon two reasons; either by an <hi>inward principle and proponsion,</hi> carrying it through slow and insensible progresses to a dissolution; or by <hi>the assaults and violence of outward oppositions:</hi> either it must be a <hi>naturall</hi> or a <hi>violent death.</hi> Now the life which we have from Christ hath no seedes of mortalitie in it selfe, because it comes from Christ: and as hee saw no corruption, so nothing that riseth from him doth of it selfe tend to corruption; for <hi>Christ dyeth no more, death hath no more power over him.</hi> He now <hi>liveth ever;</hi> not
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:16278:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onely by himselfe, but over his members; not onely as man, but as a member of his owne Bodie, which Body of it selfe, and as it is His Body, in that Spirituall and Heavenly Constitution, and under that denomination can no more die, then Christ suffer againe. For the Body of Christ, <hi>quà tale,</hi> hath no seedes of corruption in it from him. For the Apostle saith, that the seede by which we are regenerated is <note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Incorruptible seede.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the danger then must be from forren assault, and <hi>externall violence.</hi> But against all this we have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and strength of Christ himselfe to oppose. <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>He is able to save to the uttermost those that come unto God by Him.</hi> Let us consider more particularly the violences which may be offered to our Life in Christ.</p>
                  <p>First, the <hi>world</hi> assaults us with manifold tepmtations; On the left hand with skorne, misreports, persecutions, and cruell mockings, with Giants and sonnes of <hi>Anak:</hi> On the right hand with allurements, objects, promises, dalliances, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, with midianitish women. How shall wee secure our lives against such a siege of snares? Our Saviour quiets us in that case; <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 16. 33.</note> be of good cheere, <hi>I have overcome the World.</hi> Alas may the Soule answere, If <hi>Sampson</hi> should have seene a little childe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paw of a Lion, and should thus comfort him, be of good cheare for I have overcome a Lion, what safety or assurance could hence arise to him who had not the strength of <hi>Sampson.</hi> But wee must know that Christ overcame not for himselfe, but for us; and as hee hath overcome the world <hi>for us,</hi> so he doth it <hi>In us</hi> likewise by his Grace; <note n="d" place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 4. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>This is the victorie which overcommeth the World, even your Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, nay but <hi>Sathan</hi> is a more powerfull, subtill, deepe, wilie, working adversarie then the world. Where shall I have protection and securitie against him?

To vnderstand this, we must note that the strength of Faith doth not arise out of the <hi>formall qualitie</hi> thereof, (for Faith in it selfe, as a habit and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of the Soule, is as weake as other graces;) but onely out of the <hi>relation</hi> it hath to Christ.

                     <hi>saluting or embracing;</hi> they did not onely claspe Christ, but he them againe.

Rocke. Why? may not a weake superstruction ofrot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and inconsistent materials bee built upon a sound foundation? As a strong house fals from a weake foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, may not in like manner a weake house by a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest fall from a strong foundation? Surely in Christs Temple it is not as in ordinary materiall buildings. In these though the whole frame stand upon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it stands together by the strength of the parts amongst themselves, and therefore their mutuall weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and failings do prejudice the stabilitie of the whole. But in the Church, the strength of Christ the foundation is not an immanent, personall, fixed thing; but a derivative and an effused strength which runnes through the whole building. Because the foundation being a vitall founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is able to shed forth and transfuse its stability into the whole structure. What ever the materials are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, though never so fraile, yet being once incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the building, they are presently transformed into the nature and firmenesse of their foundation.

The Apostle saith, that we were <hi>crucified</hi> and <hi>dead with Christ,</hi> and<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 6, 7, 8. Gal. 6. 14.</note> that as truely, as the hand which steales is punish'd when the backe is beaten; and surely if a man were crucified in and with Christ, by reason of His mysticall communion with him) then he was crucifi'd, as Christ, for al <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> which should otherwise have laine upon him. Hee was not in Christ to cleanse some sinnes, and out of him to beare others himselfe. For the Apostle assures us that the <hi>Merit of Christ</hi> is unconfined by any sinne. <hi>The blood</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>of Christ cleanseth from all sinne.</hi> As Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> said to <hi>Monica</hi> the mother of <hi>Austen,</hi> when with many teares she bewailed her sonnes unconversion: <hi>Non potest tot lacrymarum filius perire,</hi> that is, that it could not be<note place="margin">Aug.

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>the Life of Christ is ours</hi> likewise. Christ liveth in me, saith the Apostle. Now the Life of Christ is free from the power and the reach of death. If death could not hold Him when it had Him, much lesse can it reach or overtake Him having once escaped. <hi>Hee died once</hi> unto sinne, but <hi>Hee liveth unto God:</hi> likewise saith Saint <hi>Paul, reckon you your selves to be dead unto sinne, but</hi>

my learning and naturall endowments, every thing save my sinnes and mine adversaries, and mine owne Conscience forsake mee, when I once enter into that immortalitie? When a man I say shall beginne to summon his heart unto such sad accompts as these, how will his face gather blacknesse, and his knees tremble, and his heart be even damp'd and blasted with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the middest of all the vanities and lyes of this present world? What a fearefull thing is it for an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall soule to have nothing betweene it, and eternall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery to rest upon, but that which will moulder away and crumble into dust under it, and so leave it alone to sinke into bottomlesse calamitie? O Beloved, when men shall have passed many millions of yeeres in another world, which no millions of yeeres can shorten or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, what accession of comfort can then come to those glorious joyes which we shall bee filled with in Heaven, or what diminution or mitigation of that unsupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble anguish which without ease or end must bee suffered in Hell, by the remembrance of those few houres of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorie contentments, which we have here, not without the mixture of much sorrow and allay enjoyed? What smacke or rellish thinke you hath <hi>Dives</hi> now left him of all his delicacies, or <hi>Esau</hi> of his pottage? What pleasure hath the rich foole of his full Barnes, or the young man of his great possessions? What delight hath <hi>Iezabel</hi> in her paint, or <hi>Ahab</hi> in the Vineyard purchased with the innocent blood of Him that owned it? How much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie hath <hi>Achitophel,</hi> or how much pompe hath <hi>Herod,</hi> or how much rhetoricke hath <hi>Tertullus</hi> left to escape or to bribe the torments, which out of Christ they must for ever suffer? O how infinitely doth it concerne the Soule of every man to finde this Life of Christ to rest upon, which will never forsake him till it bring him to that day of Redemption, wherein he shall be filled with blessednesse infinitely proportionable to the most vast
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:16278:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and unlimited capacities of the Creature.</p>
                  <p>And now when we can secure our Consciences in the inward, true, and spirituall renovation of our heart, in this invincible and unperishable obsignation of the spirit, who knitteth us as really (though mistically) unto Christ, as his sinewes and joynts do fasten the parts of his sacred body together; how may our heads bee crowned with joy, and our hearts sweetly bathe themselves in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruition and preoccupation of those rivers of glory which attend that Spirit wheresoever he goeth? Many things I know there are which may extremely disharten us in this interim of mortalitie; many things which therein encounter and oppose our progresse. The rage, malice and subtilty of Satan; the frownes, flatterles, threates, and insinuations of this present World; the impatience and stubbornnesse of our owne flesh; the struglings and counterlustings of our owne potent corruptions; the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consciousnesse of our fall's and infirmities; the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall entercourse of our doubts and feares; the ebbing and languishing, decaying and even expiring of our Faith and Graces; the frequent experience of Gods just dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and spirituall desertions, leaving the Soule to its owne dumpes and darknesse. Sometimes like froward children we throw our selves downe and will not stand: and sometimes there comes a tempest which blowes us downe that we cannot stand. And now whither should a poore Soule, which is thus on all sides invitoned with feares and dangers, betake it selfe? Surely so long as it lookes either within or about it selfe, no marvell if it be ready to sinke under the concurrent opposition of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny assaults.</p>
                  <p>But though there be nothing in thee, nor about thee, yet there is somthing above thee which can hold thee up. If there be strength in the merit, life, kingdom, victories, Intercession of the Lord Iesus: If there be comfort in the Covenant, Promises, and Oath of God, beleeve, and all
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:16278:247"/>
this strength and comfort is thine: leane not upon thine owne wisedome, trust not thine owne righteousnesse, arrogate nothing to thy selfe but impotencie to good: no strength of thy selfe but against thy selfe, and Gods Grace; no power but to resist and withstand the Spirit. But rest only upon the Promises and Power of Him who is <hi>Alpha and Omega, the Author and Finisher of thy Faith;</hi> Who is a Head to take care of his weakest mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. When thou art as weake as a worme in thine owne sense, yet <hi>feare not O worme Iacob, be not dismaide O Men of Israel,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>for I am thy God, I will</hi>

                     <hi>strengthen thee, yea I will helpe thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousnesse,</hi> that is, with the strength of my Truth and Promises. <hi>How shall I give thee up Ephraim,</hi> It is spoken to backsliding <hi>Ephraim; How shall I deliver thee Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah, how shall I set thee as Zeboim?</hi> That is, How shall I make mine owne Church as the cities of Sodome? <hi>My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together,</hi> and marke the reason of all. <hi>I am God, and not man.</hi> Though you are <hi>Men,</hi> subject to many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and miscarriages, yet I am not a <hi>Man</hi> that I should repent of my goodnesse, and therefore I will not turne to destroy <hi>Ephraim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now as men who looke upon the Sunne, when they looke downward againe upon darker objects, can scarse see or distinguish any thing; so ought it to bee with us, our looking up unto God should make us see nothing in ourselves, but matter to be humbled by, and driven backe unto him againe. If once the strong man beginne to glorie in his strength, or the wise man in his wisedome; If our prosperity and security make us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve with <hi>David,</hi> that we shall never be moved: If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we finde our corruptions wounded and mortified, wee beginne to insult over them more with our pride, then with our faith: How easie and just is it with God

to let in Satan upon us, to remove his hand from under us, to overshadow and withdraw His countenance from us, to set on our very wounded corruptious upon us to burne up our citie, and peradventure to plunge us in the guilt of some such fearefull sinnes, as at the very names and first suggestions whereof wee would haply before have beene startled and amazed? Alas what are wee to <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> to <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> men of such dayly communion and intimate acquaintance with the Almightie. And yet notwithstanding what fearefull testimonies have they left upon record for all posteritie to take notice what a fraile and inconstant creature man is, when once Gods Spirit departs from him? That the strength of the greatest champions in the Church of God is but like the strength of <hi>Sampson,</hi> of whom in all his great exployts the Scripture saith, that <note n="a" place="margin">Iudg. 14. 6, 19. 15. 14.</note>

Wee should be very watchfull and cautious against our selvees, that wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume not to sinne, because Grace hath abounded. <note n="e" place="margin">Rom 6. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>How shall wee that are dead to sinne, live any longer therein?</hi> saith the Apostle.

should turne all the gold it touched into lead or drosse: how injurious then and reprochfull are they to the grace of God, who extract their owne presumptions out of His mercie, and turne the redundancie of divine Grace into an advantage and priviledge of sinning?

                     <hi>Paul</hi> assures us that none but hard and impenitent hearts despise the goodnesse and riches of Gods patience and forbearance, not knowing that the goodnesse of God should lead them to repentance. It is the worke of grace to re-imprint the image of God in us, to conforme us unto Christ, to bend and incline the heart to a Spirituall delight in the Law, to remoove in some measure the ignorance of our mindes, that wee may see the beautie and wonders of Gods Law, and the difficultie and frowardnesse of the fleshly will against grace, that Gods Commands may not be grievous, but sweete unto us.</p>
                  <p>These are the branches and properties of that Life which we have from Christ. And wee have them from Him <hi>at the Sonne,</hi> as a middle person betweene us and his Father. First, because the <hi>Sonne</hi> hath His Fathers <hi>Seale:</hi> Hath <note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 26, 27. Math. 28. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Iudgement, Power,</hi> libertie to dispose of and dispense Life and Salvation to whom He will. <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Labour for the Meate that endureth unto Eternall Life, which the Sonne of Man shall give unto you; for Him hath God the Father sealed.</hi> Secondly, because the <note n="l" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Son is in his Fathers bosome,</hi> hath His heart, His eare, His affections, and therefore He is <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 11. 42.</note> 
                     <hi>heard alwayes</hi> in whatsoever Hee desireth for any of His members: and this interest in His Fathers Love was that by which He raised <hi>Lazarus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:16278:248"/>
Life againe. Lastly, he that hath the <hi>Sonne,</hi> hath the greatest gift which the Father ever gave unto the World. Hee cannot denie Life where He hath given the Sonne; He cannot with-hold silver where Hee hath given gold and Diamonds: <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>If He spared not His Son, but delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him freely give us all things?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now our <hi>life</hi> is conveyed from Christ unto us. First, <hi>by Imputation of His merit,</hi> whereby our persons are made righteous and acceptable unto God. Secondly, <hi>by Infusion or communion with His Spirit,</hi> which san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies our nature, and enables us to doe spirituall servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For though we exclude workes from Iustification formally considered; yet we require them of every Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified man; neither doth any Faith Iustifie but that which worketh by Love, though it justifie not under that reason as a working Faith, but under that relative office of receiving and applying Christ. Thirdly, <hi>by His Life and Intercession,</hi> applying His merits unto us, and presenting our services unto His Father, as lively sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, cleansed from those mixtures of deadnesse and corruption, which as passing from us did cleave unto them.</p>
                  <p>Having thus unfolded <hi>our Life by Christ,</hi> wee are in the last place to inquire into that <hi>Proprietie</hi> which wee have unto Christ, which is the ground of the Life wee receive from Him. For one thing cannot bee the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and seede of Life unto another, except there be some<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 12.</note> union, and fellowship, which may be the ground of the conveyance: and this is that which the Text call's <hi>the having of Christ,</hi> which is the same with that of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> To as many as <hi>received Him,</hi> He gave power to be called the Sonnes of God. So then there must bee a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Act, Christ exhibiteth Himselfe unto us, and wee adhere, and dwell in Him; whereby there is wrought a <note n="a" place="margin">Nostra &amp; ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius conjuncti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of natures, a concurrence to the making up of the same bodie; so that Christ accounteth Himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complete without His Church. This union of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Christ, being one of those <hi>deepe things of God</hi> which are not discernable without the Spirit, is yet set forth unto us in the Scriptures under sundrie vulgar and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous similitudes, which I will but touch upon.</p>
                  <p>It is first set forth by the expression of a <hi>Bodie,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of diverse members. Rom. 12. 4, 5. 1. Cor. 12. 12. 13. Eph, 1. 22, 23. In which places the purpose of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle is to shew how the proportion that is betweene Christ and His Church, answereth to that relation which is betweene the members of a Body and the Head. For as in the naturall Body all the members are joyned by nerves and vitall ligatures unto the Head, from whence they receive their strength and sensation, and doe, by vertue of that union to the Head, retaine a fellowship and communion amongst themselves: So is it betweene Christ and His Church. Every member of the true and mysticall Body of Christ is by a secret knot of his Spirit so fastned unto him, and so compacted with the other members by that which every joynt supplieth, as that the whole world of Elect, from Christ the Head and first borne of the Creatures, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>to the lowest and meanest of all His members, doe make up but <hi>one Body,</hi> unto which Christ, by being the <hi>Head,</hi> hath these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall relations. First, He is the principle of all Spirituall<note place="margin">Vid. Aq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ia capitis.</note> Influences, as the Head of naturall. All the Grace in us is but an overflowing and measure from His fulnesse. Secondly, He is the principle of all governement and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; all the wisedome and prudence of the Church is from Him. He is the everlasting Counsell, or the Light that inlightneth every man that commeth into the world, the power and the wisedome of God unto us. Thirdly, He is <hi>conformable</hi> to the members (for Christs Church is no monster) and maketh them conformable unto Him;
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:16278:249"/>
Hee to us in our infirmities, tempted in all things as we are; and we to Him in His holynesse: He that Sanctifieth and they that are Sanctified are all of one. Now as in a body wee resolve the whole into no parts but those which are integrall and proper to it in the nature of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and organicall Body, namely the members; though many things else are in the Body, yet nothing belongs integrally unto it, but the members: So many men are in the Body of Christ, onely by an externall and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall admission, or by some false and presumptuous perswasions and professions (as wennes or excrements in the naturall body) they doe no services, they exercise no vitall and spirituall functions, but rather cumber and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the members.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this union is compar'd unto <hi>a building or house,</hi> Eph. 2. 20. 21. 1. Tim. 3. 14. 1. Pet. 2. 5. whose stones are knitte together by the juncture and bond of Love, and are firmely grounded upon the Elect pretious and sure foundation, who as He doth by His power <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>all things,</hi> so much more those that are built upon Him. Now as in a structure the stones cannot subsist in the building by any qualities or inherent vertues of their owne, but onely by that direct and perpendicular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and subsistence which they have upon the foundation: so in the Church no graces, no carvings, no inherent excellencies doe hold men up, but onely that full and sole reliance, and subsistence of the Soule upon Christ. If a man have any other bottome that holds him up, if he be not even and full upon Christ, if hee be not in all things levelled and proportioned unto him by the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets (which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore likewise called a foundation, because by it wee are set right upon Christ, who is the <hi>Foundation of founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esai. 28. 16.</note> as the Scripture spcakes) Hee cannot abide in the building for ever; the wall and the foundation must all have the same center; and there must bee the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensions,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:16278:250"/>
and affections in us which were in Christ, His Rule must be ours, and His Ends ours, and His Will ours. If there be any such exorbitancies, and swellings out, as make the heart have quite another point and center to move to, other grounds to fixe upon, if men will despise the Word, will not be par'd and regulated to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but will <hi>trust in oppression and perversenesse, and stay on that; this iniquitie will at length prove a breach</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esai. 30. 12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>which commeth suddenly at an instant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this union is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>par'd to an <hi>ingrafture of a branch</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 1, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>in a tree,</hi> whereby the juice and nourishment of the stock is conveyed, and the branch thereby quickned to bring forth fruite. Where by the way it is worth our noting that the Church is most vsually in this particular compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Exck. 15. 3.</note> to a <hi>Vine,</hi> and the branches of a <hi>Vine,</hi> to note that there is nothing of worth or expectation in Christians, but their fruite. A man cannot <hi>make a pinne</hi> to fasten in a wall of the branch of a vine. An unfruitefull Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is the most unprofitable Creature that is; there are no secondarie uses which can mediate (as I may so speake) for a dead vine, to keepe that from the fire: either it must be for fruite or for fuell; to all other purposes it is utterly improper and unprofitable.</p>
                  <p>Now wee must observe, that a Branch may bee in a Tree two wayes. First, by a meere corporeall adheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or continuation with the stocke; by cleaving and sticking to the bodie of the Tree; and so every dead branch is in the Tree, as well as those that live: but this alone is not that which our Saviour requires, for such branches the husbandman will cut off and cast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> fire. Secondly, by a reall participation of the life, sapp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> and influences of the roote, which unto the former sort of branches, though offered, yet is not received, because of the inward deadnesse and indisposition that is in it: thus it is betweene Christ and Christians. That which makes us to be in Christ after any kinde of way is Faith.
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:16278:250"/>
And according to the differences of Faith are these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of being in Christ to bee discerned. Saint Iames makes mention of a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> when men are in Christ by some generall acknowledgement, by externall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,<note place="margin">Ian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>. 26.</note> by a partiall dependence (comming to Him only as to a <hi>Iesus</hi> for roome and shelter to keepe them from the fire; not as to <hi>a Christ</hi> for grace and government in His service) not by any particular and willing attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those vitall influences, those working principles of grace and obedience which are from him shed abroad upon true beleevers. And this is the semi-conversion and imperfect renovation of many men, whereby they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Him onely generall light of truth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vertues, which make them visibly, and externally branches in Him. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention of a lively, operative, unfained faith, which in true beleevers draweth in the power of Christs death, and the vertue of His resurrection, unto the mortification of sinne, and quickning of Spirit, and bringing forth f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

preach indeed Circumcision, but their businesse is schisme and Concision; In the Law it was Circumcision, Gods ordinance, but now being by Christ abolished it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all but a bare Concision or cutting of the flesh, and will in the Event prove a rent and schisme in the Church. The Second personall Argument is taken from the Apostles owne condition, who neither by nature nor Education was an enemie to legall Ceremonies, who in all points had as great reason to vindicate the Law, and to boast in fleshly priuiledges as any of those False Teachers. ver. 4. He was by nature <hi>an Israelite</hi> of the whole bloud as well as they; by Education, of the strictest sect of all, <hi>a pharise;</hi> by custome and practice <hi>a persecutor</hi> of the Church, under that very name because the law he had been bred under was engdanger'd by that new way; and in his course of life altogether <hi>unblameable</hi> in regard of legall Obedience and observations: and lastly in his opinions touching them, he counted them <hi>gainfull things,</hi> and rested upon them for his salvation, till the Lord opened his eyes, to see the light of the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gospell of God in the face of Iesus Christ. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the <hi>matter</hi> are first from the Substance of which Circumcision was the shadow. <hi>Wee are the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, who worship God in the spirit, and reioyce in Christ Iesus, &amp;c.</hi> Vers. 3. They boast in the flesh, they have a Concision, but we are the Circumcision, because we have the fruite and Truth of Circumcision, the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall worship of God, which is opposite to externall Ceremonies.

                        <pb n="476" facs="tcp:16278:256"/>Here then we have these two things set down, first, the <hi>Pretiousnesse,</hi> secondly the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Saving Faith.</hi> The <hi>Pretiousnesse</hi> is in the whole scope of the place, for the words are a comparative speech, where faith is preferd before all legall or morall performances. The <hi>nature</hi> is open'd by the <hi>Act</hi> of it <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and the <hi>Obiect,</hi> the <hi>vertue of Christs Resurrection, and the fellowship of his Sufferings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the former of these two, the scope of the Apostle in this place is to shew, that faith is the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and excellent gift of God to a Christian man. So it is Expresly called by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> a <hi>pretious faith.</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 1. For understanding of which point mee must note that faith may be Consider'd in a double respect. Either as it is a <hi>Qualitie</hi> inherent in the Soule, or as an <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> whereby the Soule apprehendeth some other thing. Now in the same thing there is much difference betwene it selfe as a Qualitie, and as an Instrument. Heate as a Qualitie, can only produce the like quality againe, but as an Instrument of the Sunne it can produce life and sense, things of more excellency then the Quality it selfe. Faith as a Quality is noe better then other graces of the spirit, but as an Instrument so it hath a Quickning quality which noe other Grace hath. <hi>The iust shall live by Faith.</hi> Heb. 10. 38.</p>
                     <p>This pretiousnesse of Faith is seene chiefely in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. First, in regard of the <hi>Obiects,</hi> and secondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Offices</hi> of it. First Faith hath the most preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and excellent <hi>object</hi> of any other, Christ and his Truth, and promises. <hi>Herein,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended His Love, in that when we were sinners Christ died,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. This was the soveraigne and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent love token and testification of divine favor that ever was sent from Heaven to men. <hi>God so loved the world,</hi> so superlatively, so beyond all measure or apprehension, <hi>that He gave His Sonne,</hi> Ioh. 3 16. There is such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe

of all dimensions in Gods love manifested through Christ, such a heigth and length, and breadth, and depth, as makes it exceede <hi>all knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3. 18, 19. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding &amp; unsearchable riches. In one word that which<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 7. Eph. 3. 8.</note> faith lookes upon in Christ is the price, the purchase, and the promises which we have by Him. The price which made satisfaction unto God; the purchase which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Salvation for us; and the promises which comfort and secure us in the certaintie of both; and all these are pretious things, <hi>The blood of Christ, pretious blood:</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 18. <hi>The promises of Christ, pretious promises:</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 4. <hi>And the purchase of Christ, a very exceeding and aboundant weight of Glorie.</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 17. But it may be objected, Have not other Graces the same object as well as Faith? Doe we not love Christ, and feare Him, and hope in Him, and desire Him, as well as Beleeve in<note place="margin">

                     <p>Now the Scripture useth to commend things by their order &amp; precedencie. As the women are commended for comming first to the Sepulcher; the messenger which brings the first tidings of good things is ever most wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; the servant who is neerest his masters person is esteemed the best man in that order: so Faith being the first grace that brings tidings of Salvation, the neerest Grace to Christs Person, is therefore the most excellent in regard of the obiect.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Faith is the most pretious Grace in regard of the <hi>offices of it.</hi> Though in its inherent and habituall qualification it be no more noble then other graces, yer in the offices which it executeth, it is farre more excellent then any. Two pieces of parchment and waxe are in themselves of little or no difference in value, but in their offices which they beare as instruments or patents one may as farre exceede the other as a mans life exceedes

his lands; for one may bee a pardon of life, the other a lease of a Cottage. One man in a Citie may in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall estate be much inferiour to another, yet as an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in the Citie hee may have a great precedence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance above him. Compare a piece of gold with a seale of silver or brasse, and it may have farre more worth in it selfe; yet the seale hath an Office or Relative power to ratifie covenants of far more worth then the piece of gold: so is it betweene Faith and other Graces; Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Faith in its inherent properties, so it is not more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the rest: but consider it as an instrument, by God appointed for the most noble offices, so is it the most superlative and excellent grace. These offices which are to it peculiar, I take it, are principally these three. The first to <hi>unite to Christ,</hi> and give possession of Him. The Apostle prayes for the Ephesians, <hi>that Christ may dwell in their hearts by Faith.</hi> Eph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 17.

This the Apostle explaines in the former place, where he shewes by what meanes Faith makes us liue, namely by giving us an enterance and approach to Christ; for he opposeth Faith to <hi>drawing backe,</hi> vers. 19. 30. Noting that the proper worke of Faith, is to carry us unto Christ, as our Saviour Himselfe expoundeth <hi>beleeving in Him, by comming unto Him,</hi> Ioh. 6. 64. 65. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle puts both together, <hi>not I, but Christ liveth in mee, and the life which I live, I live by the Faith of the Sonne of God.</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Faith is compared to eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, Ioh. 6. and we know there is no sense requires such an intimate and secret union to its object as that of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, no sense that is the instrument of so neere a union as that. So then as the motion of the mouth in eating is not in the nature of a motion any whit more excellent then the motion of the eye or foote, or of it selfe in speaking; yet in the instrumentall office of life and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment it is farre more necessarie: So though Faith in the substance of it as it is an inherent qualitie hath no sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular excellencie above other graces; yet as it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of conveying Christ our spirituall Bread unto our soules, and so of assimilating and incorporating us into Him, which no other Grace can doe, no more then the motion of the eye or foote can nourish the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; so it is the most pretious and usefull of all others. It may be objected, doe not other graces joyne a man unto Christ, as well as Faith? <hi>Vnion</hi> is the proper effect of <hi>Love;</hi> therefore wee are one with Christ as well by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Him, as by beleeving in Him.</p>
                     <p>To this I answere, that Love makes onely <hi>a morall union</hi> in affections, but Faith makes a <hi>mysticall union,</hi> a
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:16278:258"/>
more close and intimate fellowship in nature betweene us and Christ. Besides, Faith is the immediate tie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and a Christian, but love a secondary uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on following upon, and grounded on the former. By nature we are all enemies to Christ and His Kingdome, of the Iewes minde, <hi>wee will not have this man to raigne over us:</hi> therefore till by Faith wee are throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of Christs Love to us, we can never repay Love to Him againe. <hi>Herein is Love,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>not that wee loved God, but that Hee loved us, and sent His Sonne.</hi> 1. Ioh. 4 10. Now betweene Gods Love and ours comes Faith to make us One with Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>we have knowne and beleeved the Love that God hath to us.</hi> ver. 16. And hence it followes that because by Faith as Hee is so are wee in this world, therefore <hi>Our love to Him is made perfect, and so wee love Him because Hee first loved us,</hi> vers. 19. So that we see the union we have with Christ by Love presupposeth the Vnitie wee have in Him by Faith; so Faith still hath the preeminence.</p>
                     <p>The second office wherein consists the excellencie of Faith is a consequent of the former, namely to <hi>justifie a man:</hi> for there is no man righteous in the sight of God any further then he is taken into the unitie of Christ, and into the fellowship of His Merits. God is alone well pleased in Christ, and till a man be a member of His Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, a part of His fulnesse, hee cannot appeare in Gods presence. This was the reason why Christ would have none of His bones broken, or taken of from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of His naturall body, Ioh. 19. 36. to note the indissoluble union which was to bee betweene Him and His mysticall Members. So that now as in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodie the member is certainely fast to the whole so long as the bones are firme and sound: so in the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, where the body is, there must every member be too, because the bones must not be broken asunder. If then Christ goe to Heaven, if Hee stand unblameable before
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:16278:258"/>
Gods justice, we al shal in him appeare so too; because his bones cannot be broken. That which thus puts us into the Vnitie of Christ, must needs Iustifie our persons, and set us right in the presence of God: and this is our Faith. The Apostle gives two excellent reasons why our Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation should be of Faith rather then of any other grace. The first on Gods part, that <hi>it might bee of Grace:</hi> The second on the part of the promise, <hi>that the promise might be sure to all the seede.</hi> Rom. 4. 16. First, Iustification that is by Faith is of meere Grace and favour, no way of worke or merit. For the Act whereby Faith Iustifies, is an act of humility, and selfe-dereliction, a holy despaire of any thing in our selves, and a going to Christ, a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, a looking towards Him and His Al-sufficiencie; so that as <hi>Marie</hi> said of her selfe, so we may say of Faith; <hi>The Lord hath respect unto the lowlynes of his grace,</hi> which is so farre from looking inward for matter of Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it selfe as it is a worke of the heart, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>credere,</hi> doth not justifie, but onely as it is <hi>an apprehension or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of Christ.</hi> For as the hand in the very receiving of a thing must needs first make it selfe emptie (If it bee full before, it must let all that goe ere it can take hold on any other thing:) So Faith being a receiving of Christ, Ioh. 1. 12. must needes suppose an emptinesse in the soule before.</p>
                     <p>Faith hath two properties (as a Hand) <hi>To worke</hi> and <hi>to receive;</hi> when Faith purifies the heart, supports the droaping spirits, worketh by love, carries a man through afflictions and the like, these are the workes of Faith: when Faith Accepts of righteousnesse in Christ, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Him as the gift of His Fathers Love, when it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth the promises a farre of, Heb. 11. 13. and layes hold on Eternall Life, 1. Tim. 6. 12. This is the <hi>receiving act of Faith.</hi> Now Faith justifies not by working (lest the effect should not bee wholly of Grace, but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Grace, and partly of worke, Ephesians, 2.
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:16278:259"/>
8, 9.) but by bare receiving, and accepting or yeelding consent to that righteousnesse, which in regard of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king was the righteousnesse of Christ, Rom. 5. 18. and in regard of disposing, imputing, appropriating unto us, was the righteousnesse of God, Rom. 3. 21. 1. Cor. 1, 30. Phil, 3. 9. To make the point of Iustification by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and not the working of Faith plaine, let us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it by a familiar similitude.</p>
                     <p>Suppose a Chirurgian should perfectly cure the hand of a poore man from some desperate wound which ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disabled him for any worke: when he hath so done, should at one time freely bestow some good almes upon the man, to the receiving whereof he was enabled by the former cure; and at another time should set the man about some worke, unto the which likewise the former cure had enabled him; and the worke being done, should give him a reward proportionable to his labour: I demaund which of these two gifts are arguments of greater grace in the man, either the recompensing of that labour which was wrought by the strength hee resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or the free bestowing of an equall gift, unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving whereof likewise he himselfe gave abilitie? Any man will easily answere that the gift was a worke of more free grace then the reward, though unto both way was made by His owne mercifull cure; for all the mercy which was shewed in the cure was not able to nullifie the intrinsecall proportion which afterwards did arise betweene the worke and the reward. Now this is the plaine difference betweene our doctrine and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our adversaries in the point of Iustification. They say we are justified by Grace, and yet by workes, because grace enables us to worke: we say we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely, not by the workes of grace, but by the grace which bestowes our Iustification, and therewith our strength of working unto us. For surely Gods free grace is more magnified in giving us undeservedly both righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:16278:259"/>
and workes; then in giving us workes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our righteousnesse.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Iustification by Faith doth make the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise sure</hi> to all the seede. If unto a begger should bee proposed some excellent benefit upon condition to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme some acceptable and perfect service unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonne that offers it; whom yet it would bee impossible to please by working, without some exact abilitie for the dutie required; the man might easily doubt of the certaintie of the benefit, because his performance of the condition requir'd is uncertaine: but if the same benefit should bee proposed upon no other act on his part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, then onely the acknowledgement of his owne want, and the willing acceptance of the thing offered, a man could not bee unsure of it: So if the Lord should propose righteousnesse o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> salvation to a man upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his morall obedience, mans corruptions are so many, and his abilities so weake, his enemies so potent, and his heart so treacherous to comply with them, that the promise cannot bee made sure to him upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of his owne workes. But when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing required of a man but to cleave to Christ, nothing but to relinquish his owne endeavours, and to accept the helpe of a sure Saviour, and to rely upon the sure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> this must needes make our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and salvation to be as certaine as is the value of the merits, or fidelitie of the promise, on which we rely. If there bee nothing requisite to the firmenesse and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stencie of a house, but onely to be put upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the house must needs be as sure as the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if there bee nothing requisite to the safenesse of a mans money or writings, but to put them in a closet or boxe, the things must needes be as safe as the place into which they are put: so since nothing else is required to make our salvation sure but onely to rest upon Christ, who is a safe foundation to his Church, Math. 16. 18.
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:16278:260"/>
and a certaine Treasure, Col. 3. 3. Faith which alone puts us into him, doth therewithall make our Salvation sure unto us. <hi>Behold I lay in Sion a chiefe corner stone, elect and pretious,</hi> (there is both our foundation and our Treasure) now the safety which Faith brings from hence is this, <hi>He that beleeveth shall not be confounded,</hi> or put to shame; in the Prophet it is, <hi>shall not make hast,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 6. both words expresse safetie. For a man to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another for any good thing, and at last to faile in his expectation, this must needes shame him in the disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of his hopes; but when the hopes of a man are grounded upon the unsearchable riches, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faileable promise, and the immutable truth, power, and goodnesse of God; impossible it is that the faith of such a man should shame or deceive him. When a man is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and certaine of any good thing, he is contented to waite the season of it; <hi>David</hi> by Gods promise, and unction was certaine of the kingdome, and therefore he would not take away the life of <hi>Saul</hi> when it was in his power, but waited till the time of his death by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed should come, 1. Sam. 26. 9, 10, 11. but when a man is unconsident of a thing, hee is ready to snatch at every probabilitie, to make use of every occasion that happens to further his desires. If I should see two men going towards the Court in competition for some office or preferment, and should observe the one to ride night and day in full speede, to deny himselfe the comforts of the way, and to expresse much impatiencie and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at every stoppage that met him; the other to take time and leisure, to rely upon the former promises of the prince, or the prevalencie of some honourable friends, and to laugh at the gredinesse of his competitor, I should easily conclude that the hopes of that man were greater, whose hast as lesse: for when a man hath a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in promise, and that from the hands of a man of whose power and fidelitie he hath infallible assurance, he
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:16278:260"/>

So that Faith doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keep a man from greedinesse and precipitancie in his pursuite, and from confusion and shame in his hopes of good, because it sees them as safe, &amp; certain in the power and promises of Christ, as if they were already made good unto him. So then to conclude this point, Faith being the onely Grace wherein is magnified the fulnesse and freenesse of Gods favour, and wherein is secured his promise to all the seede; It must needes bee the fittest grace for a mercifull Iustification.</p>
                     <p>The third office of Faith, is having put us into Christ, and Iustified us by him, <hi>to give us together with Him all other things,</hi> which is the conviction that the Apostle makes, Rom. 8. 32. <hi>If Hee have given us Christ, how shall He not with Him freely also giue us all things?</hi> These <hi>All Things,</hi> are of two sorts. First, <hi>All graces:</hi> Secondly, <hi>All secular good things.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> puts them together, and shewes how they runne from Christ to us, through Faith as the pipe; <hi>His divine Power hath given unto us all things that pertaine to Life and Godlynesse,</hi> and that <hi>through the knowledge</hi> (that is, the Faith) <hi>of him that hath called us to glorie and vertue.</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 3.</p>
                     <p>First <hi>all Graces:</hi> Faith is the first Grace in a Christian Soule, and the spring of the rest. This is the maine busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that excellent chapter, Heb. 11. to shew how Faith was the master wheele in the lives and actions of those holy men whose renowne is there upon record. The Apostle tels us <hi>that Faith worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6. where by <hi>Love</hi> we may understand either generally the universall habit of all other operative graces, and then
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:16278:261"/>
the sense is, that Faith doth as it were actuate and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate all other habits of grace, and apply them to their<note place="margin">

Alex. strom lib. 2.</note> severall workes: Or rather particularly, <hi>that Love of God which is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost;</hi> and then the method and meaning of the place is this. First, Faith shewes us the great Love of God in Christ, The life that I live, saith the Apostle, <hi>I live by the Faith of the Sonne of God, who loved me, and gave Himselfe for me.</hi> Gal. 2. 20. where we see the principall discovery that Faith makes in Christ, and that it fixeth upon is His love to us; and this is a most soveraigne and superlative love: Herein saith the Apostle <hi>God commended,</hi> God heaped together <hi>His Love toward us, in that while wee were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</hi> Rom. 5. 8.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Faith having thus revealed to our hearts the Love of God in Christ, doth kindle in them a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall Love towards Christ againe, working in us the same minde that is in Christ, Phil. 2. 5. and enflaming our spirits to a retribution of Love for Love. <hi>We have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Love that God hath to us,</hi> saith the Apostle, and therefore, saith he, <hi>we love Him because He loved us first.</hi> 1. Ioh. 4. 16, 19. Thus Faith worketh Love.</p>
                     <p>But now thirdly there is a further power in Faith, for it doth not onely work Love, but it worketh by Love as the text speakes: that is, it maketh use of that Love which it hath thus kindled, as of a goad and incentive to further obedience; for that Love which we repay unto Christ againe, stirreth us unto an intimate and Heavenly communion with Him, unto an entire and spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie unto Him. And the reason is, because it is a <hi>conjugall Love,</hi> and therefore a fruitefull love, for the end of marriage is fructification. <hi>Yee are become dead to the Law,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>by the body of Christ, that yee should be married to another, even to Him who is raised from the dead,</hi> and the end of this spirituall marriage is added, <hi>That we should bring forth fruite unto God,</hi> which
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:16278:261"/>
is presently after expounded, That <hi>wee should serve in newnesse of Spirit, Rom.</hi> 7 4 6. <hi>If a man Love mee,</hi> saith our saviour, <hi>he will keepe my Words:</hi> and this obedience is the childe of Faith as it is set downe in the same place, <hi>yee shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you;</hi> and immediately upon this Faith it followes, <hi>He that bath my Commandements and keepeth them, hee it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest my selfe unto Him,</hi> Ioh. 14. 20. 21, 22, 23. In which place there are these things of excellent observation. First the noble objects that Faith doth contemplate, even the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of Gods Love unto us in Christ. <hi>You shall know that I am in my Father;</hi> in His bosome, in His bowels, in His dearest affection: One with Him in mercie, in counsell, in power. That He and I both goe one way; have both one decree and resolution of Grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards sinners: And <hi>that you are in mee,</hi> your nature in me, your infirmities in me, the punishment of your sinnes upon me, <hi>that I am bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh, that you are in my heart, and in my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest affections, that you were crucifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Now this Love kindleth a Love in us againe, and that Love sheweth it selfe in two things. First in <hi>having</hi> the Commandements of Christ; that is in accepting of them, in giving audience unto them, in opening our eyes to see, and our hearts to entertaine the wonders of the
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:16278:262"/>
Law. And secondly <hi>in keeping</hi> of them, in putting to the strength of our Love (for Love is as strong as Death; it will make a man neglectfull of his owne life, to serve and please the person whom he loves) that so wee may performe the duties which so good a Saviour requires of us. And now as our Love was not the first mover (<hi>we loved Him, because He loved us first</hi>) So neither shall it be the last; as the Father and the Son did by their first Love provoke ours, so will they by their second Love reward ours. And therefore it sollowes; <hi>He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him.</hi> This is not ment of a new Love, but of a further declaration of their former Love, namely in a more close and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar communion, and Heavenly cohabitation with them; <hi>wee will come unto Him, and make our abode with Him,</hi> we will shew Him our face, we will make all our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to passe before Him, wee will converse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with His Spirit, we will Suppe with Him, we will provide Him a feast of fatted things, and of refined wine, wee will open the breasts of consolation, and delight Him with the aboundance of Glory. Excellent to the purpose of the present point is that place of the Apostle, 2. Cor. 5. 14, 15. <hi>The Love of Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>constraineth us,</hi> that is, either Christs Love to us by Faith apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or our Love to Christ by the apprehension of His Love wrought in us, doth by a kinde of sweete and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violence winne, and overrule our hearts; not to live henceforth unto our selves, but unto Him that died for us and rose againe: and the roote of this strong perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is adjoyned, namely because wee thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>udge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we know and beleeve, that if one died for all, then all are dead to the guilt, and to the power of sinne, and ought to live a new life conformable to the resurrection of Christ againe. Therefore in two paralell places the Apostle useth promiscuously Faith and a new Creature. In Christ Iesus neither Circumcision availeth any thing,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:16278:262"/>
nor uncircumcision, but <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note>

                        <hi>new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> The reason of which promiscuous acceptation the Apostle renders the inseparable union between faith and renovation. <note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>If any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, Faith gives us <hi>all good things</hi> requisite to our condition. <hi>Adam</hi> was created Lord of his fellow inferiour Creatures, invested with proprietie to them all. In his fall hee made a forfeiture of every good thing which God gave him: In the second Covenant a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation being procur'd, Faith entitling a man to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant doth likewise re-invest him with the Creatures againe. <hi>All things,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>are yours,</hi> and hee opens the title and conveyance of them, <hi>you are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</hi> 1. Cor. 3. 23. So elsewhere hee saith that <hi>the living God giveth us all things richly to enjoy,</hi> that is, not onely the possession but the use of the things, 1. Tim. 6. 17. where by <hi>all things</hi> wee may understand, first the libertie and enlargement of Christians, as it stands in opposition to the pedagogie and discipline of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, which distinguished the Creatures into cleane and uncleane, and so by consequence into usefull and unusefull; so that now by any immediate tie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science we are not prohibited the free enjoyment of any Creature of God. Secondly by <hi>all things</hi> we understand not all simply, but all requisites; All that in regard of our state and course are necessary to life and godlinesse. O woman, saith our Saviour, great is thy Faith, <hi>Be it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee even as thou wilt,</hi> Math. 15. 28. This is a large grant to aske what we will and to have promise of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it; but hee who promiseth to beleevers what they will, doth likewise regulate and confine their wills to desire nothing but with subordination to His Will;<note place="margin">Tantum habet quantum vult, qui nihil vult nisi quod habet. Sen.</note> nothing but their owne portion, that which <hi>is food con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for them.</hi> The heathen man could say, That man hath as much as hee desires, who desires nothing but
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:16278:263"/>
what he hath. So we may say of a Christian, hee hath indeede whatsoever hee will, because God gives him a heart to desire nothing but that which is Gods promise and his owne necessitie.</p>
                     <p>Now all these things Faith gives us, first because it gives us the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> and secondly the <hi>Promises of them all.</hi> First Faith carries us to the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> that is, to God. With thee, saith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> there is <hi>the Fountaine of Life.</hi> Psal. 36. 9. And <hi>we are of God in Christ Iesus,</hi> saith the Apostle, 1. Cor. 1. 30. Now wee know there is a kinde of All-sufficiencie in a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, what ever water a man wants, hee may have his supply at the Fountaine; whereas Cisternes and broken pits will bee presently exhausted. Wee may observe in many fountaines that to the eye they seeme to have far lesse water in them for the time, then some greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or winter flood which over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>unnes whole valleyes, and carries away woods and stones before it: yet <hi>Iob</hi> tell's us that a Torrent will make men ashamed in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when they turne aside for water to refresh them, and can finde none, <hi>Iob.</hi> 6. 19. 20. But hee that comes to a Fountaine for refreshment shall never be ashamed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is living and growing water, and so makes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall supply. So the Faithfull oftentimes have lesse wealth and aboundance of earthly things then other men: yet notwithstanding they have therewith all the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> and so by consequence they have more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and more sweetnesse. First more certaintie for Fountaine water is Living water, and so it multiplies; whereas other men have their water in Cisterns that are broken, full of holes and chinkes to let it out at againe: so the Prophets tels us of some that drudge and labour, but it is <hi>in the fire,</hi> their worke perisheth as fast as it growes; and of others that eatne wages, but put it in a <hi>bagge with holes,</hi> it falles out as fast as it is put in. What are these holes, this fire that melts, and lets out the
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:16278:263"/>
estates of wicked men; they are principally these two. First, the <hi>lusts</hi> of their owne harts, <hi>Te aske and receive not, because yee spend it upon your lusts,</hi> saith the Apostle; and as lust keepes it away, so lust lets it out when wee have it. How many great estates have Wine and women, Hawkes and Hounds, fashions and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pride and vaine-glory, humours and projects, quarrels and dissentions, the backe, the belly, the eye, the eare, the tongue, the many inventions of an idle head, the many exorbitancies of a wandring heart, mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away, and reduced to nothing. Every member of the body, every appetite of the soule, so many chinkes to let out an estate. But now the faithfull have their lusts abated, their hearts ordered, the dropsie and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancie of their affections removed, and so all the holes at which Gods blessings might soke away are stopped up. Secondly, the cisternes of wicked men are broken, and their bagges full of holes by the secret <hi>iudgement and curse of God</hi> punishing their sinfull lusts in their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gaine, blasting and withering their fruitlesse estates, as Christ did the barren fig-tree. We see how the Lord threatens to curse the people for their sinnes in their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and comming in, in their basket and in their store: to breake the staffe of their bread, to take away their cup from their mouth, to take his Wine and his Oyle to himselfe againe, to consume their palaces with fire, to remove their bankers, to discover their treasures, and to seeke out their hidden things, to heare the cry of the beame, and of the stone out of the wall, and to pull them out of their nests, even from among the Starres, with infinite other the like expressions, in which the Lord useth to shew unto us the power and vigilancie of his Iustice in the administration of the World: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the faithfull have the Bread and the Word, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the blessings of God together, and so have more certaintie in these things. The Womans Oyle and
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:16278:264"/>
Meale was not much, yet it encreased, and went along with her occasions, there was a Spring in the Cruse and in the Barrell, it was living Oyle, and living Meale, that grew, and held out in the famine. As a mans occasions are, so the Fountaine supplies him. If he want a Cup, a Bucket, a Cisterne full, there is in the Fountaine answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all his wants: so whatever necessitie the Lord brings the faithfull unto, he gives them an eye to see, a heart to rest in, and to expect in the use of honest meanes a supply proportionable to each of them. And as they have more certaintie, so have they more <hi>sweetnesse</hi> in the waters which they fetch from the Fountaine. Water in pits and cisternes rots, and growes muddy and unfavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; so doe the Creatures of God to wicked men. Cares, feares, jealousies, desires, hopes, ends, infinite commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and disturbances deprive the Creatures of their native rellish and purenesse. The sweetest wine to an aguish palate tastes of that bitter humour which it there finds. So lusts and curses interweaving themselves with the Creatures in a wicked mans hands, must needs take away the sense of their simple goodnesse, turne their table to a snare, and the things which should have been for their good into an occasion of falling. Whereas the faithfull by the Word and Prayer have the Creature sanctified, seasoned, and perfumed unto their use againe, have the curse of God removed, and their owne lusts corrected, and with-held from mingling with them. Thus faith gives us <hi>all things</hi> in the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> more <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> and more <hi>sweet,</hi> by stopping the holes which did let them out, and by removing the <hi>lusts</hi> and <hi>curses</hi> which did before embitter them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Faith gives us <hi>all things</hi> by giving us the <hi>Promises. Godlinesse hath the promises of this life, and that which is to come,</hi> 1. Tim. 4. 8. Wicked men haue good things onely by Gods <hi>generall providence,</hi> which maketh his Sunne to shine as well on them as on the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:16278:264"/>
just by a common bounty. But this manner of tenure is liable to many forfeitures, curses, taxations; many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes and devastations, by wolvish and wasting lusts; and by consequence is not able to settle and secure the heart in the enioyment of them. But now by Faith in the promises the godly have their hold altered, have their estate setled in a better and surer tenure, delivered from those many encumbrances and intanglements vnto the which before they were obnoxious; so that now a mans heart is secured beyond all doubts or humane feares. A poore man may object; I am not wise enough to order my affaires, I am disabled by sicknesse and weaknesse to attend my Calling, my charge encreaseth vpon mee, and my probabilities of providing for them waxe smaller then before. But yet Faith is able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer these and all other the like objections, by propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>promise.</hi> Dost thou live by thine owne strength? Dost thou prosper by thine owne wisedome and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, or by the blessing and truth of God in his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses? and is Gods Truth an Accepter of persons? Is not his fidelitie as firme towards weake and poore, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards rich beleevers? Is there any want or weakenesse, any poverty or deficiency in heaven? Doe the promises of God stand in need of mans wisedome or strength to bring them to passe? Can thy encrease of charge or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, exhaust the Treasures, or drie vp the Fountaines and truth of God? If an honourable and wealthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have occasions to enlarge his retinue, and live at a higher pitch then before, yet because hee hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, he doth not repine at this necessitie. All the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are of the houshold and family of God, who is no whit the poorer in his state and power by maintaining many or few. He gives to <hi>all men,</hi> &amp; yet he gives <hi>liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Iam 1. 5. which no rich man in the World is able to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because as he gives to others, himself decreaseth. But God gives out of a Fountaine, as the Sunne gives light,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:16278:265"/>
which whether it shine to one, or to thousands, retaines still equall light in it selfe, neither can the eyes of men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust or draw out the light of the Sunne. <hi>All the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are mine,</hi> saith God, <hi>upon a thousand hills.</hi> If a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand hills can beare corne enough, or feed Cattel enough for any poore mans reliefe, he need not doubt or feare; for God hath still thousands of mountaines, as it were so many granaries or store-houses, in his truth and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for the faithfull in any straits to have recourse unto. And thus faith gives us all things by entituling us to the Promises.</p>
                     <p>Against all this which hath been spoken touching the excellency of Faith, may be objected that determination of the Apostle; <hi>Now abideth Faith, Hope, and Charitie, these three; but the greatest of these is Charitie,</hi> 1. Cor. 13. 13. By which comparison this point touching the precedency of faith seemes to be impaired. To which I answer; That the Apostle speakes of a greatnesse <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivè,</hi> in regard of duration, Charitie being an everlasting Grace, but faith pertaining onely to this life, as being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to the present qualitie and states of the Church: (for faith and fruition are oppos'd, 2. Cor. 5. 7. Faith looketh upon things in their promises, fruition in their reall existence) but now consider faith as an <hi>instrument</hi> to lay hold on Christ, and the precious promises of life and grace in him, and consider it as a <hi>Roote,</hi> a living principle to put the heart in worke, to purifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to enflame the heart to spirituall obedience, and a retribution of holy love to God for all his love to us in his Sonne; and thus Faith exceeds Charitie as the motion of the mouth in eating, which is an act that tends immediately to life, doth the motion of the mouth in speaking, which tendeth not to an end so important, nor absolutely necessary.</p>
                     <p>Another objection may be this. Other Graces make a man like Christ, which Faith cannot do, because Christ
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:16278:265"/>
could not beleeve unto justification, or life, having the Fountaine of both aboundantly in himselfe, whereas the proper and primitive worke of Faith is to carry a man out of himselfe, and to make him see all his suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in another. To which I answer two wayes. First, Christ had faith, though not to such purposes as wee: Faith in the common nature of it, as it imports <hi>assent</hi> to all divine <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>adherence,</hi> or <hi>reliance</hi> of the soule to the benefit and <hi>goodnesse</hi> which the same brings with it (for <hi>ratio veritatis</hi> and <hi>ratio commodi</hi> are the two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a right faith, or rather severall qualifications of the same object) thus it is a Legall thing, comming under the compasse of those duties of the Law, unto which Christ made himselfe subject. But faith as a Condition, an Officer, an Instrument of justification, so it could not stand with Christ, who was not to be righteous by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, but to bee himselfe the righteousnesse of those that beleeve. But in other respects when the Apostle saith, hee was heard in that which he feared, when hee saith himselfe, My God, my God; it is manifest, that though he had not faith for righteousnesse, yet he had it for deliverance, that though he were not saved by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, yet hee was obedient in beleeving. Secondly, it is more to be <hi>one</hi> with Christ, then to be <hi>like</hi> him; more to bee a part of him, then a picture: now faith makes a unitie with Christ, other graces onely a resemblance; faith makes a man a member, others onely a follower of him; and so in that respect still Faith hath the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miuence.</p>
                     <p>Now then from the great necessitie and pretiousnesse of this duty we may first inferre the greatnesse of their sin, who neglect it, who live with no sense of the want, and little sorrow for the weaknesse of it, to lie, sweare, revell, cozen, to live in the practice of any notorious out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and morall enormitie, many men esteeme hainous and vnworthie; But to live in infidelitie, without the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:16278:266"/>
knowledge or fellowship of Christ, in an utter unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with their owne unworthinesse, and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their everlasting insufficiencies to compasse or contrive their owne saluation, are things seldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seriouslie thought on by them. And yet infidelity is indeed the edge, and sting of all other sinnes, that which bindes them and their guilt everlastingly upon the soule, and locketh them like shackles to the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which otherwise by the helpe of Christ might easily shake them of. He that beleeveth, saith Christ, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, <hi>he that beleeveth not is condemned already, and</hi>

                        <hi>the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> There is a displeasure which is but <hi>for a moment,</hi> a wrath which doth only sing, and blow vpon the soule, and then away; such the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full themselues after some bold adventure into the waies of sinne, may haue experience of. And there is a wrath which is constant, permanent, intimately and euerlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie adherent vnto the Soule, which will seize onely vpon vnbeleeuers. <hi>The spirit shall convince the World of</hi>

All sinnes do of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues deserve damnation, but none doe <hi>de facto</hi> inferre damnation without infidelitie. This was that great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation in the Wildernesse which kept the people out of the Land of Promise, and for which God is said to have beene grieved fortie yeeres together. <hi>How long will this people provoke mee?

It is a fruitlesse labour and an endlesse folly for men to use any other courses (be they in appearance never so specious, probable, rigorous, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, Pharisaicall, nay angelicall) for extricating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues out of the maze of sinne, or exonerating their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of the guilt or power thereof without faith. Though a man could scourge out of his owne bodie ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of blood, and in a neglect of himselfe could outfast <hi>Moses</hi> or <hi>Elias;</hi> though he could weare out his knees with prayer, and had his eyes nail'd vnto heaven; though he could build hospitals for all the poore on the earth, and exhaust the Mines of India into almes; though hee could walke like an Angell of light, and with the glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of an outward holinesse dazle the eyes of all behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; nay (if it were possible to be conceiv'd) though he should live for a thousand yeeres in a perfect and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall observation of the whole Law of God, his originall corruption, or any one, though the least digression and deviation from that Law, alone excepted: yet such a man as this could no more appeare before the tribunall of Gods Iustice, then stubble before a consuming fire.

requisite to euery one of his works. A Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without a plow, or a builder without a rule, a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher without a bible, a Christian without faith, are things equally absurd and unreasonable. And yet thus unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable are men usually. By faith <hi>Moses</hi> repell'd and fled from the solicitations of his adulterous mistresse; and have they then faith that run upon temptations of lust, let their hearts wallow in the speculations, and their bodies in the beds of uncleanenesse? Faith made <hi>David</hi> looke to God when <hi>Shimei</hi> reviled him; and have they faith that dart out othes, stabs, and execrations at once against their enemie and against God? Faith made <hi>Noah</hi> when he was warned of God to feare, and <hi>Iosiah</hi> to tremble at his word; and have they faith who mocke the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and despise the Word, and misuse the Prophets, and reject the remedies, and sleight the times of their peace and visitation which God gives them? Faith made <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> put a sword to the throat of his beloved son, the Sonne of blessing, and the Sonne of promise; and have they then faith who will not sacrifice a stinking lust, nor part from a prodigious vanitie when God requires it? O what a world of sweetnes &amp; closenes is there in sin to our nature, when men love a lust, a rag, a fashion, an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, better then <hi>Abraham</hi> did his Sonne <hi>Isaak.</hi> Faith made <hi>Moses</hi> suffer rather the reproaches of Christ then the riches of Egypt; and have they faith, who had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be without Christ then their profits and pleasures; who subordinate the blood, the spirit, the will, the waies, the glory of Christ to their earthlie designes and base re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions? By faith he feared not the wrath of a King; and have they faith who feare the breath of fooles, and would faine be religious, if it did not discredit them, and crush their arts of compliance, plausibilitie, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Thus euery sinne wilfully committed is back'd and strengthened with infidelity. If men did by faith see him that is invisible, an unapproachable light, and a consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

                        <hi>fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor effeminate, &amp;c. nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor theeves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdome of God?</hi> Nothing but faith can unbinde and unlocke the sinnes from the soule, and by faith not onely their guilt, but their power and dominion is removed and subdued.</p>
                     <p>A second use and inference from this Doctrine is to enflame the heart to seeke for faith as for a pretious Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, or a hidden treasure. Men are never satisfied with<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 3. 1. Tim. 6. 19.</note> earthly treasures, though oftentimes they heape them up for the last day: How much more carefull should they be to lay up a good foundation for the time to come, that they may obtaine eternall life? Great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we may have hereunto upon these considerations.</p>
                     <p>First, the more faith a man hath, the more comfort he may take in all the good things which he doth enjoy. He may looke upon them as the witnesses of Gods truth and promises, as the tokens of his love, as the accessions<note place="margin">Matth. 6 32.</note> and supernumerary accruments unto his Kingdome, as the supplies and daily provisions of a Father which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the more faith a man hath, the more securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he hath against all evils, he may undergoe them with patience, with <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 5. 3. 4.</note> hope, with <note n="b" place="margin">Iam. 1. 2. 3.</note> joy, with <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 37. 38. 1 Cor. 15 55.</note> triumph, with <note n="d" place="margin">Esai. 27. 8. 9.</note> profit. He may looke upon them as <note n="e" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 6.</note> needfull things, as <note n="f" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 7.</note> pretious things, as <note n="g" place="margin">1.

                        <pb n="502" facs="tcp:16278:269"/>Thirdly, the more faith a man hath, the more certaine and victorious will his conquests be against his enemies: that which by faith wee relie upon, and put on, will bee impregnable munition, and impenetrable armour to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us.

                     <p>Lastly, the more faith a man hath, the more joy and glory he hath in spirituall, the more contentment and quietnesse in earthly things. <hi>Being iustified by faith, wee</hi>

In these and a world the like respects should we be moov'd to seeke for this grace: and that so much the more carefully, because the heart is of it selfe barren, and therefore very unfit to have a forraigne plant grow in it; very apt to over-top it with lusts and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. We must therefore bee diligent to make our assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance full and certaine; diligent in the <hi>Word of faith,</hi> and<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 10. Rom. 10. 8. 2.

                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, we must doe with faith, as men doe with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious things, Try it, and put it to the touchstone, that wee may prove whether it be truly valuable and unfeigned; because there is much counterfeite faith, as there is false money, and deceitfull jewels, and wilde herbes in the field, which very neerely resemble those that are right and pure. This is an argument which hath been much travail'd in by men of more learning and spirit; and therefore I will but touch upon it, by considering foure principall effects of this Grace.</p>
                     <p>The first is <hi>a love</hi> and liking of those spirituall truths which by faith the heart assenteth unto: for according as is the evidence and pretiousnesse of the thing belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, such is the measure of our love unto it. For saving faith is an assent with adherence and delight, contrary to that of Divels, which is with trembling and horror; and that delight is nothing else but a kind of rellish and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience

In every un just gaine, Christ and a bribe, or Christ and cruelty; in every oth or execration, Christ and a blasphemy; in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very sinfull fashion, Christ and a ragge, or Christ and an excrement; in every vaine-glorious affectation, Christ and a blast; in every intemperancy, Christ and a vomit, a stagger, a shame, a disease. O where is that faith in men which should overcome the world, and the things of the world? Why should men delight in any thing while they live, which when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>The second effect of faith is <hi>Assiance and Hope,</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently for the present relying on the goodnesse, and for the future waiting on the power of God, which shall to the full in due time performe, what in his word hee hath promised.

                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> what hee hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed or promised: Impossible it is but from such an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent grounded on the veracity and all sufficiency of God, there should result in the minde of a faithfull man, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident dependance on such Promises: renouncing in the meane time all selfe-concurrencie, as in it selfe utterly impotent, and to the fullfilling of such a worke, as is to be by Gods owne omnipotencie eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>A third effect of faith is <hi>ioy and peace of Conscience:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 15-13.</note> Being justified by faith wee haue peace with God. <hi>The God of peace fill you with all ioy and peace in beleeuing.</hi> The
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:16278:271"/>
mind is by the rellish and experience of sweetnesse in Gods Promises, composed unto a setled calmenesse and serenity. I doe not meane a Dead peace, which is onely an immobility and sleepinesse of Conscience, like the rest of a dreaming man on the top of a mast, but such a peace as a man may by afyllogisme of the practicall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon right examination of his owne interest unto Christ, safely inferre unto himselfe. The wicked often haue an appearance of peace as well as the faithfull, but there is a great difference. For there is but a dore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a wicked man and his sinne, which will certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one day open, and then sinne at the doore will fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soule: but betweene a faithfull man and his sin there is a wall of fire, and an immoveable &amp; impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable fort, even the merits of Christ: the wicked mans peace growes out of Ignorance of God, the Law, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: but a righteous mans peace growes out of the knowledge of God, and Christ. So that there are two things in it, <hi>Tranquillity,</hi> it is a quiet thing, and <hi>serenitie,</hi> it is a cleare and distinct thing. However, if a faithfull man have not present peace (because peace is an effect not of the first and direct, but of the second and reflexive act of faith) yet there is ever with all faith the seed of peace, and a resolution to seeke and to sue it out.</p>
                     <p>The last effect of faith which I shall now speake of is <hi>fructification;</hi> faith worketh by love. And it worketh first, <hi>Repentance,</hi> whereby we are not only to understand griefe for sinne, or a sense of the weight and guilt of it, which is onely a legall thing (if it proceed no farther) and may goe before faith; but hatred of sinne, as a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that new spirit of holinesse and grace, which in Christ wee haue receiued. For as sense of sin as a cursed thing (which is legall humiliation) doth arise from that faith whereby wee beleeve and assent to the truth of God in all his threatnings (which is a legall faith): so the Abominating of sinne as an uncleane thing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:16278:271"/>
to the image and holinesse of God (which is evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall repentance) doth arise from evangelicall faith, whereby we look upon God as most mercifull, most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and therefore most worthie to bee imitated and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Secondly, <hi>Renovation,</hi> and that two fold. First, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> in the constitution of the heart which is by faith purified. Secondly, <hi>outward</hi> in the conversation and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, when a man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things, and as he hath received the Lord Iesus so walketh in him. Now in all our <hi>obedience</hi> wee must observe these <hi>three Rules.</hi> First, that binding power which is in the law, doth solely depend upon the authority of the Lawgiver who is God. Hee that custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marilie, and without care of obedience, or feare of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, or antipathy of spirit, breaks any one Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, ventures to violate that authority which by one and the same ordination made the whole law equally binding, &amp; by consequence is habitually, &amp; in <hi>praeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iam. 2. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>animi</hi> a transgressor of the whole Law. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Obedience must not bee <hi>partiall</hi> but <hi>vniversall,</hi> as proceeding from that faith which hath respect equally to all Gods will, and lookes upon him as most true and most holy in all his commands. Secondly, As God, so his Law is a <hi>spirituall and a perfect Law,</hi> and therefore requires an <hi>inward universality</hi> of the subject, as well as that other of the Precepts which wee walke by. I meane such a spiritual and sincere obedience of the hart, as may, without any mercenary or reserv'd respects, uniformely sway our whole man unto the same way and end. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, In every Law all matter Homogeneall and of the same kind with the particular named, every sprig, seede, originall of the Dutie is included, as all the branches of a tree belong unto the same stock. And by these rules wee are to examine the truth of our obedience.</p>
                     <p>Before I draw downe these premises to a particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Assumption and Applycation, I must for Caution sake
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:16278:272"/>
premise that <hi>faith</hi> may be in the heart either <hi>habitually,</hi> as an <hi>actus primus,</hi> a forme or seede, or principle of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or else <hi>actually</hi> as an <hi>actus secundus,</hi> a particular Operation; and that in the former sense it doth but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely dispose and order the soule to these properties; but in the later it doth more visibly and distinctly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them. So then according as the heart is deaded in the exercise of Faith, so doe these properties thereof more dimly appeare, and more remisly worke.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we must note that according as faith hath severall workings, so Satan hath severall wayes to assault and weaken it. There are two maine workes of Faith, <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> to <hi>purifie</hi> and to <hi>pacifie</hi> the heart: and according unto these, so Satan tempts. His maine end is to wrong and dishonour God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chiefly hee labours to disable the former vertue of Faith, and tempts to sinne against God. But when hee cannot proceede so farre, hee labours to discomfort and crush the spirits of men: when hee prevailes in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he weakens all the properties of Faith: when in the later onely, he doth not then weaken all, but onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept and darken a Christians peace.</p>
                     <p>For understanding this point, we must note that there are <hi>many acts of faith.</hi> Some <hi>direct,</hi> that looke outward towards Christ, others <hi>reflexive,</hi> that looke inward upon themselves. <hi>The first act of faith</hi> is that whereby a man having beene formerly reduced unto extremities and impossibilities within himselfe, lookes upon God as Omnipotent, and so able to save; as mercifull, and in Christ reconcileable, and so likely to save if he be sought unto.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon growes <hi>a second act,</hi> namely a kinde of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive resolution,</hi> to be thinke himselfe of no new wayes; to trust no inferiour causes for salvation, or righteousnes, to sell all, to count them all dung, not to consult any more with flesh or blood, but to prepare the heart to
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:16278:272"/>
seeke the Lord: To resolve as the Lepers in the famine<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16. 2. Chron. 30. 19 2. King. 7. 3. 4.</note> at Samaria, not to continue in the state he is in, nor yet to returne to the Citie, to his wonted haunts and wayes, where he shall be sure to perish: and from this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man cannot by any discomforts bee removed, or made to bethinke himselfe of any other new way, but onely that which hee sees is possible and probable, and where he knowes, if he finde acceptance, hee shall have supplyes and life enough: and this act may consist with much feare, doubt, and trembling. The Syrians had food, and Samaria had none, therefore the Lepers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to venture abroad. Yet this they cannot doe without much doubting and distrust, because the Syrians whom they should meete with were their enemies. However this resolution over-rul'd them, because in their present estate, they were sure to perish, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was roome for hope, and possibilitie of living; and that carried them co <hi>Esters</hi> resolution; If we perish, we perish: such is the Act of Faith in this present case. It is well assured that in the case a man is in, there is nothing but death to bee expected; therefore it makes him resolve to relinquish that. It lookes upon God as plenteous in power and mercie, and so likely to save, and yet it sees him too as arm'd with Iustice against sinne, as justly provoked and wearied in his patience; and therefore may feare to bee rejected, and not saved alive. Yet because in the former state there is a certainty to perish, &amp; in the later a possibility not to perish, therefore from hence ariseth a <hi>third act,</hi> a conclusive and positive purpose to trust Christ. I will not onely deny all other wayes, but I will resolve to trie this way, to set about it, to go to him that hath plenty of redemption and Life. If I must perish, yet He shall reject me; I will not reject my selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will goe unto Him. And this act or resolution of faith is built upon these grounds.</p>
                     <p>First, because Gods Love and free Grace is the first
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:16278:273"/>
originall mover in our salvation. If God did beginne His worke upon prevision of any thing in and from our selves, we should never dare to come vnto Him, because wee should never finde any thing in our selves to ground His mercie towards us upon. But now the Love of God is so absolute and independant, that it doth not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire nothing in us to excite and to cal it out, but it is not so much as grounded upon Christ himselfe. I speake of His first Love and Grace: Christ was not the impulsive cause of Gods first Love to mankinde, but was Himselfe the great gift which God sent to men therein to testifie that Hee did freely love them before. <hi>God so loved the</hi>

                        <hi>World, that He gave His Son. Herein is Love, not that we loved Him, but that Hee loved us and sent His Son.</hi> The love must needs go before the gift, because the gift is an effect, a token, a testimonie of the Love. Christ first <note n="a" place="margin">Ephes. 5. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>loved the Church, before He gave Himselfe for it.</hi> Now then if the first Love of God to man was not procured, merited, or excited by Christ Himselfe as Mediator; but was altogether absolute: <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 9. 11.</note> much lesse doth the Love of God ground it selfe upon any thing in us. The whole series of our Salvation is made up without respect to any thing of ours, or from us. <note n="c" place="margin">1. Iohn. 4. 19. Hos. 14. 4.</note> He Loved us without cause or ground in our selves. For we Love Him, because <hi>He first loved us.</hi> He elected us of meere grace, without cause or ground from our selves. <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 11. 5. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>There is a remnant,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>according to the Election of grace; and if of grace, then is it no more of workes, otherwise grace is no more grace.</hi> Hee called us without Intuition of any thing in our selves, <note n="e" place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 9.</note>

                        </gap>, saith the Apostle, <hi>not according to our owne workes, but according to His pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and grace He called us with an Holy calling.</hi> He Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified us without any ground in or from our selves, <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 3. 14. 4. 5. 5. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>frely by his grace, when we were enemies and ungodly persons.</hi> He saveth us without any ground in and from our selv's. <note n="g" place="margin">Eph. 2. 8. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>By grace ye are sav'd through faith, &amp; that not of your selvs</hi>'.
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:16278:273"/>
There is nothing in us of which wee may boast in the matter of Salvation, and therefore there is nothing in us which should make us despaire or flie from God: for all the gradations and progresses of our Salvation are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone from His Grace.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, because there is an All-sufficiencie in the righteousnesse and merits of Christ, <note n="h" place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 7.</note> To cleanse all sin, <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> To consummate all our saluation, to subdue all our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 8. 31. 32.</note> To answere all our objections, to silence all challenges and charges that are laid against us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, because of the manifold experiences which many other grievous sinners have found of the same love, and All-sufficiencie. When Faith lookes upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Manasse,</hi> upon a thiefe translated into paradise, upon a persecutor turned into an Apostle; and when it considers that God <note n="l" place="margin">Mal. 2. 15.</note> hath a residue of spirit still, that the blood of Christ is an inexhausted fountaine, and that these spectacles of Gods compassion are in the Scriptures exhibited, that <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> wee through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope, and that God in <note n="n" place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 16.</note> them did shew forth all long suffering for a patterne to those who should after beleeue in Him: It then makes a man reflect inward upon himselfe, and resolve to trie that gate, at which they have entered before.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, because there is a generalitie and unlimited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the <hi>Invitation</hi> unto Christ. <note n="o" place="margin">Math. 11. 28.</note>

                     <p>Fifthly, because God Himselfe workes the worke and the will in us. For in the <hi>new Covenant</hi> God workes first. In the first Covenant man was able by his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and naturall strength to worke his owne condition, and so to expect Gods performance: But in the New, as there is difference in the things covenanted, then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteousnesse and Salvation, now <note n="u" place="margin">Ier. 31. 34.</note>

Hee doth not onely commaund us, and leave us to our created strength to obey the Command, but He furnisheth us with His owne Grace and Spirit to fulfill the Commaund, and when He bids us come unto Him, He doth likewise draw us unto Him. In this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>the first Treatie</hi> is betweene God and Christ. For though the Covenant be betweene God and us; yet the negotiation and transaction of it is betweene God and Christ, who was <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 7. 22. 8. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>a suretie of the Covenant for us.</hi> For first God in His decree of Love bestowed us upon Christ. <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 17. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>(Thine they were, and thou gavest them unto me)</hi> we were <note n="c" place="margin">Ephe. 1. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>chosen in Him:</hi> wee to be members in Him, and He to be a Head and Fountaine unto us of all grace and glorie. For <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 18. Ioh. 14. 14.</note> God had committed unto Him
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:16278:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Office of power to redeeme His Church, and He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Commandement from His Father to finish the worke of mediation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, being thus made Christs, partly by the gift of Gods eternall Love, partly by Christs owne vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie susception of that Office whereby He was to be a Head and Captaine of Salvation to His Members; God in due time reveales Himselfe, His Name, Power, and Covenant unto us: <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 17. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>I have manifested thy Name unto the men which thou gavest mee,</hi> and this is the tender of the Covenant, and beginning of a Treaty with us. And here God beginnes to worke in us: for though the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant be proposed under a condition; yet God gives us as well the condition as the Covenant.

Thus as we were made Christs by <hi>donation, Thou gavest them me;</hi> so after likewise by <hi>incorporation,</hi> and unitie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with him in his spirit, and having this Spirit of Christ, He thereby worketh in us the will and the deed, and thus <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 3 33.</note>

                        <hi>jnfidelitie makes God a lyer,</hi> by saying either I looke for life some other way, or I have nothing to doe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Christ for it, though God have proposed Him as an all-sufficient Saviour. Now then when man hath experience of Gods working this will in him, when he
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:16278:275"/>
findes his heart opened to attend, and his will ready to obey the call: when hee is made desirous to feare Gods Name, and prepared to seeke His face, ready to subscribe and beare witnesse to all Gods wayes and methodes of saving; That Hee is righteous in His Iudgements, if He should condemne; wonderfull in His patience, when He doth forbeare; mighty in His power, wisedome, and mercie, when Hee doth convert; unsearchable in the riches and treasures of Christ, when he doth Iustifie; most holy, pure and good in all His commands; the soveraigne Lord of our persons and lives, to order and dispose them at His will; on the sense and experience of these workes doth grow that conclusion and resolution to cleave to Christ.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, because this act of Faith is our dutie to God: As we may come to Christ because we are <hi>called,</hi> so wee <hi>must come,</hi> because wee are <hi>commanded.</hi> For as Christ was <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 18.</note> commanded to save us, so we are <note n="f" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 24.</note> commanded to beleeve in Him. From these and the like considerations ariseth a purpose to rely on Christ. But yet still this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose at first by the mixture of sinne, the pragmaticalnesse and importunitie of Satan in tempting, the unexperience of the heart in trials, the tendernesse of the spirit, and fresh sight and reflexion on the state of sinne, is very weake, and consisteth with much feare, doubts, trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shrinking, mistrust of it selfe. And therefore though all other effects flow in great measure from it, yet that of comfort, and calmenesse of spirit, more weakly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the heart being most busied in sprituall debate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, prayers, groanes, conflicts, struglings of heart, languishing and sighing importunities of spirit, is not at leisure to reflect on its own translated condition, or in the seeds time of teares to reape a harvest of Ioy. As a tree new planted is apt to be bended at every touch or blast of winde, or children new borne to crie at every turne and noyse, so men in their first conversion are usually
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:16278:275"/>
more retentive of fearefull, then of more comfortable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</p>
                     <p>The last act then of Faith is that <hi>reflexive act,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man knoweth his owne Faith and Knowledge of Christ, which is the assurance of faith upon which the joy and peace of a Christian doth principally depend; and hath its severall differences and degrees according to the evidence and cleerenesse of that reflection. As beautie is more distinctly rendered in a cleere, then in a dimme and disturbed glasse; so is comfort more distinct and evident according to the proportions of evidence and assurance in faith. So then to conclude with this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule; according as the habits of faith are more firme and radicated; the acts more strong, constant and evident; the conquests and experiences more frequent and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull; so are the properties more evident and conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For the measure and magnitude of a proper passion and effect, doth ever follow the perfection of the nature and cause whence it proceedes: And therefore every man as he tenders either the love and obedience he owes to God, or the comfort he desires in himselfe to enjoy, must labour to attaine the highest pitch of Faith, and still with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to grow in the knowledge of him and his resurrection and sufferings. So then upon these premises the heart is to examine it selfe touching the truth of faith in it. Doe I love all divine truth, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is proportionable to my desires, but conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God who is the Author of it? Can I in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states without murmuring, impatiencie, or rebellion, cast my selfe upon Gods mercie, and trust in Him though He should kill me? Doe I wholly renounce all selfe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and dependance, all worthinesse or concurrence of my selfe to righteousnesse? Can I willingly, and in the truth and sinceritie of my heart, owne all shame and condemnation, and acquit God as most righteous and holy if He should reject me? Doe I not build either my
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:16278:276"/>
hopes or feares upon the faces of men, nor make either them or my selfe the rule or end of my desires? Doe I yeeld and seriously endeavour an universall obedience unto all. Gods law, and that in the whole extent and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude thereof, without any allowance, exception, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation? Is not my obedience mercenarie, but sincere? Do I not dispense with my selfe for the least sprigges of sinne, for irregular thoughts, for occasions of offence, for appearances of evill, for motions of concupiscence, for idle words, and vaine conversation, for any thing that carries with it the face of sinne? And when in any of these I am overtaken, doe I bewaile my weaknesse, and renew my resolutions against it? In a word, when I have impartially and uprightly measured mine owne heart by the rule, doth it not condemne mee of selfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, of hypocrisie, of halting and dissembling, of hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing and prevaricating in Gods service? I may then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably conclude, that my Faith is in some measure ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and effectuall in mee: Which yet I may further trie by the nature of it, as it is further expressed by the Apostle in the Text; <hi>That I may know him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here we see the nature of faith is expressed by an <hi>act of knowledge,</hi> and that act (respectively to justification) limited to Christ; <hi>This is eternall Life to know thee, and him whom thou hast sent:</hi> where by knowledge I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>a certaine and evident assent.</hi> Now such assents are of two sorts; some grounded upon the evidence <hi>of the object,</hi> and that light which the thing assented unto doth carrie and present to the understanding; as I assent to this truth, that the Sunne is light by the evidence of the thing it selfe: and this kinde of assent the Apostle contradistinguisheth from faith by the name of sight. Others are grounded upon the <hi>authoritie or authentical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a narrator,</hi> upon whose report while wee rely without any evidence of the thing it selfe, the assent which we produce is an assent of <hi>faith or credence.</hi> Now

or why doth the Church beleeve these or these truths to bee divine? Surely not because the Church hath so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; our Saviour Himselfe would not be so belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>If I beare record of my selfe, my record is not true.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 31. Eph. 1. 23.</note> Well then, the Church must needes beleeve by the spirit which leads it into all truth.

since wee must take even the determinations of the Church and Pope, (though they were infallible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) at second hand as they passe through the mouth of a Priest, whose authoritie, being not infallible, nor apostolicall, but humane, impossible it is not but that he may misreport His holy Father, and by that meanes mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guide and delude an unsetled soule.</p>
                     <p>Againe I demaund, How doth it appeare unto mee, that the Iudgment of the Church is infallible, when it alone is the warrant of my Faith? That this is it selfe <hi>no principle,</hi> nor to the light of naturall reason <hi>primo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </hi> manifest <hi>ex evidentia terminorum,</hi> is most certaine.

                        </gap>y and <hi>por se</hi> evident, since there must first needs <hi>apriori</hi> be discovered some internall difference betweene those men, from whence, as from an antecedent princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, this difference of erring or not erring must needes grow.</p>
                     <p>Now then I demand, what is that whereby I doe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto this proposition (in case it were true) That the Church cannot erre? The Church it selfe it cannot be, since nothing beares record of it selfe, and if it should, the proofe would be more ridiculous then the opinion, being but <hi>idem peridem, and petitio quaestionis.</hi> Above the Church a <hi>Priori</hi> there is not any light but the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the spirit. Therefore needs by these must I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto that one proposition at least. And if unto that by these, why then by the same light may I not assent unto all other divine truths, since evident it is, that the same light which enables me rightly to apprehend one object, is sufficient also to any other, for which a lesser light then that is presumed to suffice? So then a true faith hath its evidence and certainty grounded upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the word, as the instrument, and of the spirit of God raising and quickning the soule to attend, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:16278:278"/>
the things therein revealed, and to set to its owne seale unto the truth and goodnesse of them. But how doe I know either this word to be Gods Word, or this spirit to bee Gods spirit, since there are sundry false and lying spirits? I answer, first, <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> there are many particular Churches, and Bishops, which take themselves to be equally with Rome members, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the universall Church. How shall it invincibly appeare to my Conscience that other Churches and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops all, save this onely, doe or may erre? and that this, which will have me to beleeve her infallibility, is not her selfe an hereticall and revolted Church? This is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion controuerted. By what autority shall it be decided, or into what principles <hi>á priori</hi> resolved? and how shall the evidence of those principles appeare to the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? That the Popes are successors of <hi>Peter</hi> in his see of Rome, that they are doctrinall as wel as personall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, that <hi>Peter</hi> did there sit as moderator of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, that his infallibility should not stick to his chaire at Antioch, as well as to that at Rome; that Christ gave him a principality, jurisdiction, and Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to have to himselfe over all others, and to leave to his successors; who though otherwise privat men, and not any of the pen-men of the holy Ghost, should yet have after him a power over those Apostles who survivd <hi>Peter</hi> (as it is manifest <hi>Iohn</hi> did.) That the scripture doth say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny title of all this, that the traditions which do say it are a divine word, are al controversed points: and though there be sorceries more then enough in the Church of Rome, yet I doubt whether they have yet enough to conjure themselves out of that circle, which the agitation of these questions doe carry them in. But secondly, there are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry lights, there is light in the Sunne, and there is light in a blazing or falling starre. How shall I difference these lights will you say? surely I know not otherwise then by the lights themselves; undoubtedlie the spirit brings a
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:16278:278"/>
proper, distinctive, uncommunicable Majesty and luster into the soule, which cannot be by any false spirit coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited: and this spirit doth open first the eie, and then the Word, and doth in that discover <hi>not as insit as veritatis</hi> those markes of truth and certainty there, which are as apparant as the light, which is without any other <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> by it selfe discerned.</p>
                     <p>Thus then we see in the general, That saving faith is an assent created by the word &amp; spirit. We must note further that this knowledge is two fold, first, <hi>Generall, mentall, sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Now this faith is called <hi>knowledge.</hi> First, in regard of the principles of it, The <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 10. 14. 2.

Secondly, in regard of the ground of beleeving, which is the knowledge of Gods will revealed: for none must dare demand or take any thing from God, till hee have revealed his will of giving it; <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.

                        <hi>He hath said,</hi> must be the ground of our faith.. Thirdly, in regard of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and undoubtednesse which there is in the assent of faith. <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 4. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> was fully perswaded of Gods pow'r and promise; now there is a twofold certainty: a certainty of the thing beleeved, because of the power and promise of him that hath said it; and a certainty of the minde belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. The former is as full and sure to one beleever as to any other, as an Almes is as certainly and fully given to one poore man who yet receives it with a shaking and Palsie hand, as it is to another that receives it with more strength. But the mind of one man may bee more certaine and assured then another, or then it selfe at some other time: sometimes it may have a certainty of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, assurance, and full perswasion of Gods goodnesse; sometimes a certainty onely of Adherence, in the midst of the buffets of Satan, and some strong temptations, whereby it resolveth to cleave unto God in Christ, though it walke in darkenesse, and have no light.

grow'th, as the Apostle here intimates; we know heere but in part, and therefore our knowledge of Him may still increase.

                     <p>
                        <hi>And the power of His resurrection.</hi>] The Apostles desire in these words is double. First, that he may finde the workings of that power in his soule, which was shewed in the resurrection of Christ from the Dead, that is, the Power of the Spirit of Holynesse, which is the mighty principle of Faith in the heart. That Spirit <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 1. 4. Rom. 8. 11. 1. Pet. 3 18. EPhe. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It is as great a worke of the Spirit to forme Christ in the heart of a sinner, as it was to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion Him in the wombe of a virgin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that He may feele <hi>the resurrection of Christ</hi> to have <hi>a Power in Him.</hi> Now Christs resurrection hath a twofold Power upon us or towards us. First, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all His merits unto us, to accomplish the worke of His satisfaction, to declare his conquest over death, and to propose himselfe as an All-sufficient Saviour to the faithfull. As the stampe addes no vertue nor matter of reall value to a piece of gould, but onely makes that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue which before it had, actually applyable and currant: So the resurrection of Christ, though it was no part of the price or satisfaction which Christ made, yet it was that which made them all of force to His members. Therefore the Apostle saith that Christ <hi>was Iustified in</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Spirit.</hi> In His Death Hee suffered as a malefactor, and did undertake the guilt of our sinnes (so farre as it denotes an obligation unto punishment, though not a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:16278:280"/>
of punishment;) but by that Spirit which raised Him from the Dead Hee was Iustified Himselfe, that is, He declared to the world that Hee had shaken of all that guilt from Himselfe, and as it were left it in His Grave with His Grave clothes. For as Christs righteousnesse is compared to a robe of triumph, so may our guilt to a garment of Death, which Christ in His Resurrection shooke all of, to note that Death had no holdfast at all of Him. When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was raised, It is said that Hee<note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 44.</note> came forth bound hand and foote with Grave cloathes, to note that Hee came not out as a victor over Death, unto which He was to returne againe: but when Christ rose Hee left them behinde, because death was to have<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 6, 7.</note> no more power over Him. Thus by His resurrection He was declared to have gone through the whole pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment<note place="margin">Revel. 1. 18.</note> which Hee was to suffer for sinne, and being thus justified himselfe, that hee was able also to justifie others that beleeved in him.

condemn'd already. Now when Christ was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for sinne, hee thereby deliver'd us from the death of the Law, which is the curse: so that though some of the grave cloathes may not be quite shaken off, but that wee may be subject to the workings &amp; feares of the Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some occasions, yet the malediction thereof is for ever removed.

The wicked shall be dead everlastingly to all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and wayes of sin, which here they wallowed in. As

there remaines nothing to a drunkard or adulterer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his youthfull excesses but crudities, rottennesse, diseases, and the worme of Conscience; so the wicked shall carry no worlds nor satisfactions of lust to hell with them, their <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 49. 17.</note> glorie shall not descend after them. These things are truths written with a sunne beame in the booke of God: First, That <note n="b" place="margin">1. Thes. 4. 16, 18. Matth. 25. 46.</note> none out of Christ shall rise unto Glorie.

Whence the conclusion is evident, That every impenitent sinner, who without any inward hatred &amp; purposes of revenge against sinne, without godly sorrow forepast, and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all renovation for after-times, allowes himselfe to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in any course of uncleannesse, spends all his time and strength to no other purpose, then <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.

                     <p>Again, this power of Christs resurrection is a ground of solid and invincible comfort to the faithfull in any pressures or calamities though never so desperate, because God hath power and promises to raise them up againe.

Thirdly, against Death it selfe; because wee shall come out of our graves as gold out of the fire, or miners out of their pits, laden with gold and glory at the last.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, wee must from hence learne <note n="s" place="margin">Col. 3. 1.</note> to seeke those things that are above whither Christ is gone. <note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 18. 36.</note> Christs Kingdome is not here, and therefore our hearts should not be here. <note n="u" place="margin">Eph. 4. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Hee is ascended on high, and hath given gifts unto Men,</hi> as absent lovers send tokens to each other, to attract the affections, and call thither the thoughts.

                        <hi>but it is his Will that we be where He is:</hi> and therefore we must make it the maine businesse of our life to move towards him. Things of a nature encline to one another even to their prejudice. A stone will fall to his center, though there be so many rubbes in the way, that it is sure to bee broken all to peeces in the motion. The same should be a Christians resolution.

to goe, notwithstanding he must be broken in the way with manifold temptations, and afflictions. Saint <note n="y" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 4.</note>

                        <hi>Power of his Death,</hi> cleansing our Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from dead workes, mortifying our earthly mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, crucifying our old man, subduing our iniquities and corruptions, pulling downe the throne of Satan, spoiling him of all his armor, and destroying the workes of the Divell. And this power worketh, first, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall office of Christ, Revealing; secondly, by his Regall office, applying and reaching forth the power of his bloud to subdue sinne, as it had before triumphed over death and Satan.</p>
                     <p>But here the maine point and question will be, what this mighty power of the Death of Christ is thus to kill sinne in us, and wherein the <hi>Causality</hi> thereof Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth?
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:16278:282"/>
To this I answere that Christs Death is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Cause of the death of sinne in his members.</p>
                     <p>First, It is <hi>Causa meritoria,</hi> A meritorious Cause. For Christs death was so great aprice that it did deserve at Gods hand to have our sinnes subdued. All power and Iudgement was given unto him by his father, and that power was given him to purchase his Church withall. And this was amongst other of the covenants, that their sinnes should be Crucified. He gave himselfe unto<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25, 26.</note> Gods Iustice for his Church; and that which by that gift he purchased, was the sanctification &amp; cleansing of it. Now as a price is said to doe that which a man doth by the power which that price purchased: so the bloud of Christ is said to cleanse us, because the office or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whereby he purifieth us, was Conferd upon him <hi>Sub intuitu pretij,</hi> under the condition of suffring. For it was<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22. 23.</note> necessarie that remission and purification should be by bloud.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is <hi>Causa exemplaris,</hi> The death of Christ was the Exemplar pattern, and Idea of our Death to sin.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 24.</note> He did beare our sinnes in his Body on the tree, to shew that as his Body did naturally, so sinne did by analogie and legally dye. Therefore the Apostle saith that he was made sinne for us; to note that not onely our persons<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 21.</note> were in Gods accompt Crucified with him unto Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but that sinne it selfe did hang upon his Crosse with him unto monification and holinesse. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>That he condemned sinne in the flesh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> because he died as sinne <hi>in Abstracto.</hi> And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ification wee are said to be planted in the likenesse of Christs Death; because as when an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador doth solemnize the marriage of his king with a forraine princesse, that is truely effected betweene the parties themselves, which is transacted by the agent, and representative person to that purpose and service autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>: so Christ being made sinne for us (as the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:16278:283"/>
had the sinnes of the people emptied upon him) and in that relation, Dying; sinne it selfe likewise dieth in us. And there is a proportion betweene the Death of the Crosse which Christ died, and the Dying of sinne in us. Christ died as a Servant, to note that sinne should not rule, but be brought into slaverie and bondage: He died a Curse, to note that wee should loke upon sinne as an accursed and devoted thing, and therefore should not with Achan hide, or reserve any: He Dranke vinegar on his Crosse, to note that wee should make sinne feele the sharpnesse of Gods displeasure aginst it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was fast naild unto the Crosse, to note that wee should put sinne out of ease, and leave noe lust or Corruption at large, but crucifie the whole body thereof. Lastly though he did not presently die, yet there he did hang till he died; to note that wee should never give over subduing sinne while it hath any life or working in us. Thus the Death of Christ is the patterne of the death of sinne.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is <hi>Causa Obiectiva,</hi> an Impelling or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cause as <hi>Obiects</hi> are. For Obiects have an <hi>Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi>

How shall I dare (thinkes the faithfull soule) to live in those sinnes by which I may as truely be denominated a betrayer and Crucifier of him that saved mee, as <hi>Iudas,</hi> or <hi>Pilate,</hi> were? Thirdly It lookes on him as <hi>Our Forerunnerinto Glorie.</hi> whither<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 20. Luk. 24. 26. 1. Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

From whence the heart easily concludes, if Christ Entred not into his own glory but by suffering, how shall I enter into that glory which is none of mine, if I shed not the bloud of my lusts, and take order to Crucifie all them before I goe?</p>
                     <p>So then none can Conclude that Christ died for him, who findes not himselfe Set against the life of sinne within him, in whom the body of Corruption is not so lesned, as that it doth no more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

fellowship and vertue of the bloud of Christ hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done little good to such a man. And what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing is it for a man to live and die in an estate much more miserable then if there never had beene any Iesus given unto men? For that man who hath heard of Christ, at whose heart he hath knocked, unto whose<note place="margin">Math. 11. 21, 24 Heb. 10, 28. 29.</note> Conscience he hath beene revealed, and yet never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in him unto righteousnesse, or sanctification, but lives and dies in his filthinesse, shall be punished with a farre sorer Condemnation, then those of Tyre, Sydon, or Sodome, that knew nothing of him. O then let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to shew forth the power of Christs Death, and that he died not in vaine unto us. Though wee cannot yet totally kill, yet let us crucifie our corruptions, weaken their vigor, abate their rage, dispossesse them of the throne in our hearts, put them unto shame: and in as much as Christ hath Suffered for sinne, let us cease from sinne, and live the rest of our time not to the will of the<note place="margin">1.

                     <p>The second part of our fellowship in sufferings with Christ is the <hi>conformitie</hi> of ours to His.

                     <p>Now of these sufferings of the Church we must note that they have no conformitie with Christs in these two things.

In other respects there is a conformitie of our sufferings to Christs; so that He esteemeth them His.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Our sufferings are:</hi> First, such as wee draw upon our selves by our owne folly; and even in these afflictions which Christ as the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For Christ is so full of tendernesse, and so acquainted with<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note> sorrowes, that wee may justly conceive Him touched with the feeling of those paines, which yet He Himselfe seeth needefull for them. Secondly, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>such as are by God<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 3. 1.

Pet. 4. 14.</note> giveth us His Spirit to draw in the same yoke with us, and to hold us under them by His strength. That Spirit of Holynesse by which Christ overcame his sufferings, helpeth our infirmities in ours. Secondly, in the manner<note place="margin">1.

And these also beare conformitie unto Christs, as in the two former respects, so thirdly in the cause of them, for it is Christ only whom in his members Satan and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
