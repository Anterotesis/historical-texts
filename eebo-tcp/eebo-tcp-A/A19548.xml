            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The cogitation heereof, had almost perswaded me not to withdraw your Lordshippe, so much as to the viewe of these my slender labours, but that the seuerall bandes of duty which I owe vnto your Lordship, ouer-swayed with me heerein at the last. For hauing not onely beene called (as from little <hi>Zoar</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) by that message which to me was no other then the voice of God, though some younger <hi>Samuels,</hi> may perhappes mistake it to bee <hi>Elias</hi> voice; but further also in that straitnesse of time, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily encouraged by your Lordship to this seruice; the fruit of my labours therein (if it be any) I iudged it my duty to present to him, by whose Authoritie and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were first vndertaken.</p>
            <p>Againe, seeing my heartie and sincere desire heerein, was to testifie my vnfaigned loue, first to Gods truth, and then to the peace of our <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in both which, I expect no lesse then the seuerest censures of two, in themselues op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, and both of them very rigorous aduersaries, who contrary to the Apostles <note n="e" place="margin">Ephes. 4, 15.</note> rule, either follow not the truth, or follow it not in loue: I was emboldened in both these to

            <p>Besides, I must and do with thankefulnes acknowledge, which I haue often heeretofore gladlie recounted, a good part of that light with which God hath in mercie vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed vnto me, to haue bin receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that faire burning lamp, which many years in our Vniuersitie, your L. verie often and happilie helde forth vnto vs: then especiallie, when in the last yeares of our late Soueraigne, &amp; in those, as some thought, declining daies; wherein the children of <hi>Babylon,</hi> vpon some vainly conceiued hopes, I know not what, began somwhat insolently to insult. At which most needfull time it cannot bee forgotten, how the religious, constant &amp; godly zeal of your <hi>L.</hi> being one most eminent in that place, did animate &amp; incourage many others, my selfe among the rest, who then sat at the feet of <hi>Gamali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and who by those words vttered in fittest time, by the tongue of the learned, found in our selues, how truly the <hi>Wiseman</hi> saide, <note n="f" place="margin">Eccles. 12, 11</note> The words of the wise are like goads, and like nailes fastned by the maisters of the assemblies.</p>

prosperity of this most flourishing church and kingdome, and to heare of the myrth and melodie in our streets this day, hath mooued me to make choice of these wordes of the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> to King <hi>Salomon;</hi> wherein euery one may see both a fit correspondence to our <hi>Salomon,</hi> and a woorthy example of that loue wee all owe to him, and thankesgiuing vnto God, for this so great, and so incsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable a blessing.</p>
            <p>In the wordes themselues, not to seeke any curious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision (which in an History you will not expect) obserue I pray you with me, foure seuerall pointes, which concerne foure seuerall parties.</p>
            <p>The first, concernes King <hi>Salomon;</hi> wherein is set downe a singuler commendation of his wisedome, which excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all reports. [<hi>Behold the one halfe, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p>The second, concernes the people and Subiects of King <hi>Salomon;</hi> wherein is declared their blessed and happy estate, who had <hi>Salomon</hi> a wise King to rule <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>uer them. [<hi>Happy are thy seruants.</hi>]</p>
            <p>The third, concernes Almighty God, wherein is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a most Religious thankesgiuing vnto him, for placing <hi>Salomon,</hi> a wise King ouer his people. [<hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ssed bee the Lord thy God.</hi>]</p>
            <p>In which third point, besides many other, two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar branches are especially to be considered: the former, from whom <hi>Salomon</hi> had or held his kingdome, and that was immediately from God, who made him King ouer <hi>Israel,</hi> and placed him in his owne throne, and in his owne stead.

            <p>The fourth and last point, concernes the Queene of <hi>Sheba;</hi> wherein is set forth, a manifest and outward testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the honour and honourable respect shee bare toward King <hi>Salomon,</hi> in token whereof, s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The first point, concernes the admirable, &amp; (indeed) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable wisedome of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> whereof God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is a most sufficient witnesse. <hi>Wisedome and knowledge is granted vnto thee, so that there hath not bin the like among the Kings which were before thee, neither after thee shall th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

It is not my purpose to make any paralell to <hi>Salomon,</hi> of whom God himselfe hath saide, that none should be like vnto him: nor take vppon me to set forth vnto you, any portraiture of that wisedom, which no <hi>Zeuxes</hi> nor <hi>Apelles</hi> can otherwise expresse, but

            <p>Yet with all loyall submission, let mee thus much say, and say much lesse then I do conceiue: Neither can this present age, nor al the Chronicles (I say) not of great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> onely, but of all <hi>Europe,</hi> present vnto vs a King, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such admirable gifts of Learning, Iudgement, and Memory; adorned with so many princely and Heroicall Vertues, Iustice, Clemency, and Wisedome; especially, with that Diuine and Heauenly wisedome, which is the Fountaine and foundation of all the rest; with Religion, Piety, Zeale, and constant Magnanimity to professe, maintaine, and vphold the truth of God, and of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
            <p>Which report of mine, if any suppose to be too lauish, and with this Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> beleeue it not, let him well consider, those many, and most Religiously wise speeches, vttered in a manner in the hearing of the whole Realme: Conferences, Disputations, free Monarchies, but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that most learned Apologie, for the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance against the Popes two <hi>Breues,</hi> and that kingly gift, fit onely for a peerelesse King, to giue to a peerelesse Prince; all which are but some few sparkes of that euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning Lampe, or but small streames, of that euer and ouer-flowing spring, and then hee will bee forced euen with admiration, to professe and say with this Queene, as after the hearing and reading of diuers of them, my selfe with many others, haue often said, <hi>It was a true word indeed which I h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:25274:6"/>
which concernes the King, and the admiration of his great wisedome.</p>
            <p>The second point concernes the people and subiects of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> of whom the Queene heere saith, that they were blessed &amp; happy, who had <hi>Salomon</hi> a wise king, to rule ouer them. <hi>Happy are thy people, and happie are thy Seruants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can there in truth be a greater comfort to any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or greater safety to any kingdome, then to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a wise and prudent King: <hi>By a man of vnderstanding and knowledge, a Realme indureth long.</hi> Prou. 28, 2. A wise man (much more a wise King) is as a fortresse and strong piller, to support euen an whole Realme: <hi>And better is wisedome, then weapons of warre.</hi> Eccles. 9, 28. Nay, a wise King, is not onely a safety, but euen an happinesse (as the Queene heere saith) to a kingdom, for so God himselfe doth witnesse. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10, 17. <hi>Blessed art thou, ô Land, when thy King is the sonne of Nobles,</hi> that is by the <hi>Hebrew</hi>

            <p>On the contrary, a foolish or childish king, is one of those heauy Iudgements and curses, which God in his wrath threatens to bring vpon a land. <hi>I wil appoint children to bee their Princes, and Babes shall rule ouer them.</hi> Isay 3, 4. And againe: <hi>Woe vnto thee (ô Land) whose King is a child, a child in knowledge, in wisedome, in vnderstanding. Ecclesiastes.</hi> 10, 16.</p>
            <p>The reason of both which, is very euident. <hi>A Wise King, gouernes with</hi> Iustice <hi>and</hi> Equity, <hi>and the Kinges Throne is established by righteousnesse.</hi> Prouerbes 25, 5. <hi>And the King that iudgeth in Truth, his Throne shall bee established for euer.</hi> Prou. 29, 14.</p>
            <p>Againe, a prudent and wise King, as he maintaines <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> so his principall and chiefe care is, to maintaine and aduance piety and godlinesse, the true &amp; sincere worship of God throughout all his kingdomes.

               <hi>that he ruled thy people prudently with all his power.</hi> And wherein did his prudence appeare? <hi>he was no</hi>

               <hi>sooner set vpon the throne, but he assembled all the congregation of</hi> Israel, <hi>and they brought againe the Arke of the Lord, with singing and dauncing; with Vyols, with Cimbals, and with Trumpets,</hi> 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 13, <hi>verse</hi> 2, <hi>and</hi> 8. The like did that most religious and wise King <hi>Iosiah, He made a Couenant before all the people, to walke after the Lord, and to keepe his Commandements; and be caused all that were found in</hi> Ierusalem <hi>and</hi> Beniamin <hi>to stand to that couenant, and he compelled all that were found in</hi> Israel, <hi>to serue the Lord.

            <p>I may truely heere say vnto you, your selues also being witnesse, and say it to the immortell praise of Gods name, to the honour of our Soueraigne, and to the ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all his people, that in this happinesse, this renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Kingdome, among all, and aboue all Nations of the

            <p>The first is our long tranquility and happie peace, with all the blessings and blessed fruites of peace. A blessing which God began to bestow on this land, at the ioyful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of our late Soueraigne QVEENE ELIZABETH, whose Sacred spirite doth now rest and raigne with the Lord, but her memory shall bee blessed and eternized in the world for euer; when all those venomous <note n="k" place="margin">

Hauing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed long and happy peace, vnder her long and happy raigne, it was expected by the Agents and vassals of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, that the day which ended her life, should haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all our comforts, and beene to vs a dismall day, a day of murthers and massacres, a day of warres, of tumult, and of vtter desolation; one of their owne false Prophets <note n="l" place="margin">West, de trip. homin. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

Yea, and this very day which they had cruelly designed to weeping, mourning and lamentation, God by the happy meanes of our SALOMON, hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it (as we all now see) to a day of mirth and melodie; a day offeasting, singing, and reioycing; a day of praise and thankesgiuing to his blessed name, which be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore magnified and praised, and blessed for euermore.</p>
            <p>A second blessing, which vnder our SALOMON this whole Empire enioyeth, is the sincere profession of Gods holy truth, the blessed continuance, yea the establishment also ther<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

And as the Israelites did <note n="s" place="margin">Zach. 12, 12, 13.</note> in honor of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> euery Tribe and family shall praise thee apart, and their Wiues apart: The royall and princely Tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi> shall prayse thee apart, and the holy Tribe of <hi>Leuie</hi> shall praise thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: The Nobility shall praise thee apart: the Gentry &amp; Commons shall praise thee apart: The Students of a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions shal praise thee apart: the Men of Warre, and the Men of Peace shall praise thee apart: yea, euery House, &amp; euery Family throughout all Israell shall praise thee apart.</p>
            <p>We in this age will speake of thy praise to our Children, &amp; our Children, to their Childrens Children, vnto all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. And if it were possible that we or our posteritie could bee silent herein, yet the Magnificent and princely buildings and Monumentes, in these two famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Citties, the very wood and wals of these houses, &amp; stones in these streets, euen with their dumb eloquence, would sing aloud, and sound foorth thy Noble praise: all which in their kinds are pertakers of that happines, which vnder thee, and by thee, we then all receiued.</p>
            <p>Iudge now with your selues, if besides many and great blessinges which I haue purposely omitted, for these so
<pb facs="tcp:25274:13"/>
great and indeed inualuable blessings which by the happy meanes of our SALOMON we doe enioy, we may not all most iustly say to him, as did the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> to King <hi>Salomon:</hi> [<hi>Happy O King are thy people, and happy are thy Seruants.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Shall I further here adde, whereof this Queene is silent in that King of Israel, that the wisedom of our SALOMON is an happinesse, not onely to his owne people and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, but euen to strangers also? The gracious beames there of like those of the Sunne, spreading themselues to far and forraine Countries; yea, to the vtmost Coastes of this and the other world.</p>
            <p>To omit many other and euident proofes hereof, euen that which beeing the chiefe, if time would suffer ought not to bee omitted, that with such constancy and zeale, himselfe holds forth a glorious Lampe of Piety, and true Religion vnto all Christian Kings and kingdomes, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming heerein that which Gods spirite hath noted <note n="t" place="margin">Eccle. 12. 9.</note> as the greatest part of wisdome, the more wise the King was, the more he taught them knowledge, &amp; caused them to heare: But omitting these, let the honourable expedition now happily intended for <hi>Virginea</hi> be a witnesse: enterprised, I say not <hi>auspicijs,</hi> but by the most wise &amp; religious direction and protection of our chiefest Pilot, seconded by so many honorable and worthy personages in this State and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that it may iustly giue encouragement with alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and cheerefulnesse for some to vndertake, for others to further so noble &amp; so religious an attempt. I may not stay in this straightnes of time, to mention, much lesse set forth vnto you, the great and manifold benefits which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to this our so populous a Nation, by planting an English Colony in a Territory as large and spacious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as is England, and in a soyle so rich, fertill, and fruitefull, as that besides the sufficiencyes it naturally yealds for it selfe, may with best conuenience, supply some of the greatest wantes and necessities of these Kingdomes. Of these and such like particulars I will
<pb facs="tcp:25274:14"/>
not now intreat, though I could commend them by more then ordinary and vulgar report vnto you.</p>
            <p>But that happinesse which I mentioned, is an happie and glorious worke indeede, of planting among those poore and sauage, and to be pittied <hi>Virginians,</hi> not onely humanitie, instead of brutish inciuility, but Religion also, Piety, the true knowledge and sincere worship of GOD, where his name is not heard off: and reducing those to Faith and saluation by Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who as yet in the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their Infidelity and superstition, doe offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, yea, euen themselues vnto the Diuell.</p>
            <p>This being the Religious and honourable intendment of this enterprise, what glory shall heereby redound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? What Honour to our Soueraigne? What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to those his Subiects, who shall be the meanes or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of so happy a worke, not only to see a new BRIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINE in another world, but to heare also those, as yet Heathen, Barbarous, and Brutish people, together with our English, to learne the speech and language of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and next after their Hymnes and <hi>Alleluia<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> vnto God, to sound forth the honour and happinesse of our Soueraigne; not onely saying with this Queene of <hi>Sheba, Happy are thy people, and thy Subiects,</hi> but happy are wee and others, that were strangers to you; yea strangers and aliants to God, happy are we by thee, and by thy wisedome.</p>
            <p>And this be spoken of the second generall point, which concernes the people and their happinesse, by hauing <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> a wise and prudent King to rule ouer them.</p>
            <p>The third generall point concernes almighty God, and containes a thankesgiuing to him, for setting <hi>Salomon</hi> a wise King to rule ouer his people. <hi>Blessed bee the Lorde thy God which set thee on his Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The acknowledgement in this Queene, of the true God of <hi>Israel,</hi> of his Diuine prouidence, and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent power in placing <hi>Salomon</hi> in his owne Throne; of his goodnesse and loue to <hi>Israel,</hi> whom hee would esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish for euer; of his righteousnesse, in that hee would
<pb facs="tcp:25274:14"/>
haue his people gouerned by Iustice and Iudgement; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this her Religious thankesgiuing vnto God, for this blessing bestowed on his people; all these are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euident demonstrations of her true knowledge of God, of her loue to God, and Gods Children, of her sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Piety, and Religious seruing of God; &amp; that though by Nature she was a Gentile, and aliant from God, yet was she by his speciall grace one of those <hi>Primitiae gentium,</hi> which were ingrafted into the true Oliue, and made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the fatnesse thereof, and of those heauenly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings stored vp in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>But I purposely omit all these particulers. The onely point which I would now commend vnto you is, what a motiue and prouocation this ought to bee for vs all, to laud and magnifie the Lord, for placing so wise and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious a King ouer vs and all these kingdomes.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Salomon</hi> was but a stranger to this Queene, who yet as you see is so thankfull to God: He so farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a stranger to vs, that we may say as did the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> to King <hi>Dauid. 2. Sam.</hi> 5, 1. We are thy bones, and thy flesh.</p>
            <p>She being but a soiourner for a very short time in that kingdome, could not long pertake the benefit of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, nor of peace and protection by his Iustice and Iudgement: But we from our SALOMON, receiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall influence of his Diuine both Sacred and Politicall Wisedome, continuall protection vnder his sacred shield, continuall tranqu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lity vnder his most iust, equall, and wholsome Lawes, both Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill: How much more then should our mouths be filled with praises and blessings vnto the Lord our God? And how Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously should we say as she did; <hi>Blessed be the Lord thy GOD, which loued thee, to set thee on his Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not, but for these blessings of the Lord, often times in your priuate houses and Chambers, ye sing Hymnes and Psalmes with a grace in your heartes vnto the Lord. But because for these publicke and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb facs="tcp:25274:15"/>
blessinges, GOD lookes for publicke and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary praises at our hands; because we are now as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in this place, as at the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to offer the sweet Sacrifice and Incense of our lippes vnto God, and this day both before men and Angels, to testifie our thanksgiuing vnto God, our loue and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> loyaltie to our Soueraigne. Let euery one of you prouoke &amp; stirre vp another, and suffer me as one of the Trumpeters of the Lord to excite vs all, and stirre vp your prepared hearts, and Religious affections, for all and euery of these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, to laud and magnifie the glorious name of God, and if it be possible, by some extraordinary straine of our vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thankes, to pierce the very skies, and giue an eccho to those Celestiall Quires, singing <hi>Halleluiah, Halleluiah,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and praise, and glory, be vnto God, &amp; to the Lamb for euermore.</p>
            <p>First, for that aboundance of our continued and happy peace, let vs say with the Prophet, <note n="u" place="margin">Psa. 147, 12, 13.</note> Praise the Lord, O <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> praise thy God, O <hi>Sion,</hi> for he hath made fast the barres of thy gates, and blessed thy children within thee: He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the flower of Wheat.</p>
            <p>For establishing togither with this peace, his holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Sanctuary among vs, and in it the true and sincere worship of his holy name, O that wee could expresse the like ioy, as did the <hi>Israelites</hi> for their Temple which <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> built and established among them! All the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation assembled therein, the Leuites and singers of all sortes, of <hi>Asaph, Heman,</hi> and <hi>Ieduthun,</hi> being clad in fine Linnen, stood with Cimbals, with Vyols, &amp; with Harpes, at the East end of the Altar, and with them an hundered and twenty Priests blowing with Trumpets, &amp; they were all but as one man, and made but one sound to be heard in praising the Lorde. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 5, 12, 13. But because the pompe and beauty of the second Temple, is euen as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the first, let vs yet with the best Trumpets of our hearts and tongues, and with all our most solemne Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:25274:15"/>
of musick, sing that Psalme of Thanksgiuing, which they then did vnto God; Praise the Lord, for he is good, and his mercy indureth for euer. Praise the Lord.</p>
            <p>Like ioy and thankesgiuing let vs all shew for the Arke of the Lord, which by the meanes of our SALOMON, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods owne ordinance is established on those holy Mountaines of <hi>Sion,</hi> of which the Lord hath saide, Heere will I dwell, for I haue a delight therein.</p>
            <p>Yea, let vs for these blessings, not onely sing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, but with the Kingly Prophet, <note n="x" place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 14. 15.</note> euen shoute, and daunce with all our might before the Lorde. For which, howsoeuer some <hi>Michols</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or of the house of <hi>Saule,</hi> shall scoffe and scorne, and tauntingly say vnto vs. O how glorious are you for the Temple, and for the Arke this day! yet this is our comfort, and shall for euer bee our honour, that in vprightnesse of heart, we can truly say with that man of God: It is before the Lord, who hath chosen vs, and not your Fathers house, and who hath commaunded vs to rule ouer the people of God: and therefore will wee sing, and play, and daunce; yea, and be more vile also then thus before the Lorde. And euen of those maide-seruants of <hi>Israel,</hi> of whom you spake, that is, of the holy Church of God, shall we be had in honor. But for those scoffing <hi>Michols</hi> of the reiected house of <hi>Saule,</hi> and those blaspheming <hi>Rabsekaes</hi> of <hi>Assyria,</hi> they shall be as chaffe scattered before the Winde, and as dung swept away from the presence of the Lord, and from the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>But what can we render vnto God, or say vnto him for that most rare and woonderfull deliuerance? Let vs say with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> after the like deliuery from the Iawes of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the red sea. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15, ver. 1, 2, 11. We will sing vnto the lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously. Who is like vnto thee O Lord; glorious in holines, fearefull in praises &amp; doing wonders: the lord is my strength &amp; praise, &amp; is become my saluation: he is my God, and I will praise him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is my fathers God, and I will exalt him. Or let vs
<pb facs="tcp:25274:16"/>
sing that Psalme <note n="y" place="margin">Psal. 124.</note> of the whole Church. If the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had not beene on our side, may <hi>Israel</hi> now say. They had swallowed vs vp quicke when they were so wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully displeased at vs. The Waters; nay, the raging Fires had deuoured vs, the flames had gone ouer our soule. Praised bee the Lord, which hath not giuen vs ouer for a prey vnto their teeth.</p>
            <p>Lastly, for all these, and for all other the blessinges of the Lord; specially, for his Sacred Maiesty, vnder whom, and by whom wee liue, and liue to enioy them all; let vs with one heart and minde sing that last Psalme of the Prophet: O praise God in his holinesse, praise him in the firmament of his power; praise him in his Noble actes, praise him according to his excellent greatnesse: Praise him in the sounde of the Trumpet, praise him vppon the Lute and Harpe, praise him in the Cimbals and Daunces, praise him vpon the strings and Pipe: praise him vpon the well-tuned Cimbals, praise him vpon the loud Cimbals. Let euery thing that hath breath, praise the Lord.</p>
            <p>And this be spoken of the thankesgiuing to God, for placing <hi>Salomon</hi> a wise King ouer his people.</p>
            <p>In this Thankesgiuing, we before obserued two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Branches. The former was, from whom King <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had and held his kingdome. Of which it is heere she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, that he had it neither from the Priest, nor from the people, but immediately from God; and therefore, it is expressely heere said, [<hi>God made thee King ouer Israel</hi> and <hi>He set thee on the Throne</hi>] not the Priest, not the people, but God made him King, and God set him on the Throne. For further euidence whereof, it is heere added that <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was set in the Throne, neither of the Priest, nor of the people, but he was set in Gods owne Throne, as King, &amp; set there in Gods steed, as one immediately represeuting Gods owne person among them, and beeing his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Vice-gerent, or Lieutenant ouer all <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpose, the Scriptures, not onely in generall call Kings the Ministers or Lieutenants of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13,
<pb facs="tcp:25274:16"/>
4. and saith, that God sets vp Kinges and giues kingdoms, <hi>Daniel</hi> 2. 21. 37. but particularly also noteth this immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate designment of God in many of them: as of <hi>Dauid,</hi> The Lord chose him to be King, and delighted in him to make him King ouer all <hi>Israell. 1. Chron.</hi> 28, 4. Of <hi>Saul,</hi> The Lord hath annointed thee to be Gouernor ouer his inheritance, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1. Of <hi>Hasael</hi> and <hi>Iehu,</hi> God saide vnto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, annoint <hi>Hasael</hi> King ouer <hi>Aram,</hi> and <hi>Iehu</hi> shalt thou annoint King ouer <hi>Israel, 1. King.</hi> 19, 15. and to omit others of <hi>Salomon,</hi> whom our Text mentioneth: God chose <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to sit vpon the Throne, and he said of <hi>Salomon;</hi> I will stablish his Kingdome for euer. 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28, 5, 7.</p>

            <p>The other Testimony is an Authenticall record also of no lesse moment, and somewhat of a later time. A statute made in the 16. yeare of King <hi>Richard 2. Cap. 5.</hi> of purpose to keepe sacred and inuiolable the Soueraignety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of this Kingdome. It was therein declared, that the Crowne of England hath beene so free at all times (not then onely, but which is specially to bee remembered at all times) that it hath beene in subiection to no Realme, but <hi>Immediately subiect to GOD, and to none other,</hi> in all thinges touching the Regalty of the same. These are the words in that statute, besides diuers other tending hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, In defence of which statute they in the Parliament then assembled, promised to liue and die, as it is there noted.</p>
            <p>By al which it is euident, that this doctrine which now at <hi>Rome</hi> is counted most ridiculous, is in it self most sacred, as being grounded on the scriptures of God; and as most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hath bin embraced by all the Christians in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church; taught and maintained with a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by the ancient and godly fathers in their seuerall ages and successions: constantly defended by whole kingdoms and Empires, and that vnder paine of high Treason to the gainesayers thereof, euen in those later times also, when superstition had dimd, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, but not quite extinguished and put out the truth, and (which is far worse) the loue of the truth, as it may iustly be feared, it hath done at this day in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in those of their sect, who to error and heresie haue added not onely obstinacy, but blasphemy, like new <hi>Lucians</hi> scoffing the sacred truth of God, accounting it a most a ridiculous matter.</p>

            <p>And to whom else thinke you but to the vtter enemie of God, to that man of sinne, and sonne of perdition, who exalts himselfe indeed, as the Apostle <note n="s" place="margin">2.

            <p>True Loyalty (which I doubt not but you do performe, and to the constant and continuall performance whereof, I earnestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you all this day) is to looke at our Soueraigne, as at one pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced immediately by God, placed in Gods owne Throne, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the steede of God himselfe among vs: And then to loue, honour, and obey him, not for other respects, but for that Loue, Religious dutie and conscience, which wee owe vnto God, who placed him in his own throne, and in his own stead to gouerne vs.</p>
            <p>To honour and obey him for fear, is seruility and basenesse; to obey for gaine or profit, is selfe-loue; to obey with that imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition, is <hi>Implicite,</hi> Rebellion, and Antichristian; to loue and honour him (as wee all ought) for his owne Piety, Vertue, and goodnesse, is Christian Charity; but to loue and obey him for Gods owne cause, who set him in his owne Throne, to rule in his own steed, is true and Christian Loyalty, true and most loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Subiection. And this be spoken of the first particular braunch proposed; Namely, from whom the King had or held his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, euen immediately from God, who made him King, who set him in his Throne, and in his steed ouer the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:25274:27"/>The other particular; Namely, what moued or induced God to place <hi>Salomon</hi> ouer his people, which was no desert of theirs, either King or people, but his owne fauour and free loue vnto them, I purposely omit, and in that short remainder of the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time, intend to speake a little of the last point, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you all to the grace of God.</p>
            <p>

But they were outward &amp; euident testimonies of that reuerence &amp; loue, &amp; of that louing &amp; honorable respect, which both she and they had to King <hi>Salomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like customes of giuing presents, hath bin vsuall from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects also, thereby to testifie, not only their loue, as did strangers, but their loyalty also to their Soueraignes. <hi>Suetonius</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">In vir. Aug. cap. 57. 58.</note> reportes, that the <hi>Romans</hi> by their <hi>Strenae</hi> or annuall presents, testified their loue to <hi>Augustus,</hi> whom they honoured as <hi>Patrem patriae.</hi> Of King <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> it is said. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 17, 5. that in token of their loue and loyall affections, All <hi>Iudah</hi> brought presents to <hi>Iehosophat.</hi> On the contrary, it is said of those wicked men, sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifull Subiects of King <hi>Saule,</hi> the wicked men despised him, and brought him no presents 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 27.</p>
            <p>It is not my purpose to speak of this particular vnto you, though I might truely compare the willingnes and readinesse of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes of our SALOMON, to those of <hi>Constantius Clorus,</hi> father vnto <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great. Of whom <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, <note n="e" place="margin">Abiecta om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctatione, mature, auro, argento &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijs opum ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neribus aeraria eius complete laborant.
