            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>SUch are the horrid crimes of Treason and Murder, that by daily experience we see they seldom go unpunished even in this life: The Wise man gives wholsome advice when he fore-warns men <hi>to take heed they do not curse the King, altho' it be in their secret Chambers, lest the Fowles of the Ayr make discovery thereof:</hi> much more ought men to Tremble at the thoughts of any undertaking against the life of God's Vicegerent. It is a horrid murder for a private man to compass the Death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and much more horrid the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Country; for altho', men may think to flee out of one Country into another, and <unclear>secure</unclear> themselves from the vengeance due to such crimes, yet Providence so orders it, that those very methods they take for their security, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly brings them to Justice, as we have a fresh Example of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons now brought thereto.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Ayloff</hi> took his lot with the late Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> setting up for one of the Rulers of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and after the design was blasted, and he amongst others taken, the sence of his Guilt run him forthwith upon the Rock of Despair, by laying violent hands upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and with a Pen-Knife or other Instrument which he carried about him he rips <unclear>up</unclear> his own belly as far as Nature would suffer him; but God in Mercy to his Soul, so ordered it, that he did not Dye thereof, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long illness Recovered, and was with others of those <unclear>traytors</unclear> brought for <hi>England,</hi> and soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where he remained Eight or Ten Weeks.</p>

               </hi> 
               <unclear>and</unclear> one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Captains in that Western Rebellion. Soon after the deseat of the Rebels, being taken and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to some Goal in the <hi>West</hi> Country, was from thence brought to <hi>Newgate,</hi> 
               <unclear>where</unclear> his Crimes had little better Effect (then the other in <hi>Scotland</hi>) behaving himself for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time like a Person destracted, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <unclear>impatient</unclear> under the sufferings <unclear>which</unclear> his <hi>Treason</hi> had brought upon him.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 26<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1685 Upon the motion of the King's Council, a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to bring up these two Criminals to the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench-Bar</hi> at <hi>VVestmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and being accordingly on <hi>Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 27<hi>th. Ditto,</hi> brought up by the Keeper of <hi>Newgate</hi> to the said <hi>Bar.</hi> The Lord Chief Justice <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> and the other Judges of that Court sitting on the Bench.</p>
            <p>First, Mr. <hi>Ayloff</hi> was called to hold up his hand, and told that he had been Indicted by the Name of <hi>Iohn Ayloff</hi> late of <hi>London</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> for <hi>High-Treason</hi> in conspiring the Death of his late Majesty, the subversion of the Government <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That he had thereupon been Out-Law'd, and stood attainted of <hi>High-Treason,</hi> was therefore askt what he had to say why Judgment should not be awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for him to dye according to Law.</p>
            <p>To which Mr. <hi>Ayloff</hi> at first reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had been out of the Land and did not know of it, at last said, that he had seen or heard only of a print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Tryal</hi> of Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Mr. <hi>West</hi> had made some mention of him; but he desired to know what was sworn against him by the Witnesses.</p>
            <p>Then the same Method being used to Mr. <hi>Nelthorp,</hi> he answered very little, only said he had not conspired the Death of the King.</p>
            <p>After that, the Lord Chief Justice in an Excellent Speech, declaring that it was no hard case for Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to be Executed upon an Out-lawry, and how inexcusable they of all men were, who had not only fled from Justice, deprived themselves of a Tryal, by standing in contempt of the Law, but ingaged since in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54623:2"/>
other Treasons and Rebellions; his Lordship also giving them divers Christian admonitions to improve the short time they had left for the good of their Immortal Souls.</p>
            <p>In <unclear>conclusion</unclear> told them, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remained for that Court but to award Judgment upon the Out-lawries. And a Rule was made for their Execution on <hi>Fryday</hi> the 30th day of the said Moneth, as in Cases of High Treason.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Ayloff</hi> then desired he might have the liberty of his Friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and the same being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, provided it was in the presence of a Keeper, they were remanded to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Thursday</hi> the 29th <hi>Ditto,</hi> one of his Majesties Council moved the Court of Kings Bench, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Rule was made for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the said <hi>Iohn Ayloff</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Nelthorp</hi> as the next day; for a more publique Example, one of them, <hi>viz. Ayloff</hi> might be Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over against the <hi>Temple Gate</hi> in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> and <hi>Nelthorp</hi> against <hi>Grayes Inn</hi> in <hi>Holborun,</hi> to which Inns of Courts they did formerly belong when they Studied the Law; and the Court ordered it to be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>Pursuant to which Rules of Court on <hi>Fryday</hi> the 30th <hi>Ditto</hi> about ten in the Forenoon, first <hi>Richard Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> was drawn from <hi>Newgate</hi> on a Sled, to a Gibbet erected over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Grayes Inn Gate</hi>; he had on a Black Sute, and two in Black Habit went by the Sled, <hi>viz.</hi> on each side one. After it followed an Elderly Person also in Mourning, he was but a short time at the Gibbet before Executed, he spoke to several that were near him with a seeming cheerfulness, Praying also with great earnestness, and to appearance at this last moment of his Life submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with greater patience to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments which his Treasonable practices had brought upon him, then he did during his Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; very readily, addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to undergo the Sentence which the Law had pronounced. He had on a Whlte Sattin Cap over a Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen one, and himself helped to pull it down over his Face. Being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned off, he Hanged the usual time, and then was Quartered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Ayloff,</hi> by some called Col. <hi>Ayloff,</hi> according to the Rule of Court made for his Execution, was delivered by the Keeper of <hi>Newgate,</hi> on the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> to the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> between Ten and Eleven in the Morning; when being put into a Slead; he was conveyed through the <hi>
                  <unclear>Old-Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</unclear>
               </hi> and <hi>Fleet-street</hi> to a Gibbet Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between <hi>Chancery-Lane</hi> End, and one of the <hi>Temple Gates,</hi> where upon his arrival being in the Slead, he confessed that he was in the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on raised by <hi>Argile</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was Conscious of the late Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that he suffered justly and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, praying for the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring the Prayers of all people, but more especially of those that were spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators; after which and the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, he came out of the Slead, again, and desired God to bless all present, lifting up his hands and Eyes towards heaven, when looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gibbet he ascended, and in ascending, repeated his Prayers for the People, praying to God to keep them in the right way of Loyalty and Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to preserve the Protestant Religion; being ascended, he prayed a while to himself, and turning at the request of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, his Back to the Ladder; he said that he was now willling to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54623:3"/>
dye, but bid the Executioner not to turn him off till he gave notice; the signal being the lifting up his hands; when being bid to go somewhat low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the rounds of the Ladder, the sooner to put him out of his pain, when turned off, he after having prayed a while, said he was ready, biding the Executioner turn him off, which was accordingly done, when having hang'd about half an hour; he was cut down and quarter'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sentence, and his Quarters to be disposed of, at the pleasure of the King.</p>
