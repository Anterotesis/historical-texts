            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of grace, but there is no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betweene them in shining,

Now all the body must not bee a

But in this mysticall body

                  <p>Secondly, in respect of the

doe onely deale in profits from
earth, and for earth: in earth are
they gotten, and in the earth are

Ciuill trading oft times
calleth men from the worship of

                  <p>But for supernaturall and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
trading, as all the six dayes

the Lords mart or market, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
all his people with prouision
for the whole weeke following.</p>
                  <p>And for the place: All places
are not fit for ciuill marts and
merchants; but the principall
prohibited place is the Church,
the house of God: <hi>Matth. 21. 12.
Iesus went into the Temple of God,
and cast out all them that bought
&amp; sold in the Temple, &amp; ouerthrew
the tables of the mony changers, &amp;
the seats of them that sold Doues:</hi>
Christ would not endure his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house of prayer to be made
a house of merchandise. But in
spirituall trading, for heauen, all
places are fit for Christian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who should goe no where
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14231:21"/>
but still be trading for grace: and
continually either bee doing of

and reason of this resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
standeth in fiue thing:</p>
                  <p>1. A Merchant man is a man

is no Pedler, nor chapman

things, for great bulks,<note place="margin">1 In great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,
for great sums, and dealeth
in most rich commodities.</p>
                  <p>So the Christian Merchant care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for heauen, aymeth not at the
base profits of this life; as siluer,
gold, &amp; such corruptible things:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14231:21"/>
for these things are but sinall in
his eye and contemptible, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the businesse of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

These are that one thing needful,<note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Such rich Merchants were
the Martyrs; who hauing heauen
in their eie, esteemed their goods
libertie, yea life it self not worth
hauing in comparison therof. For
as a man if he were as high as the
Moone, would see the earth but
as a pricke; so he whose thoughts
are in heauen, and his eyes on
things that are aboue, within the
veile; esteemeth the earth but
small, and despicable. For euen as
the great light drowneth the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser;
so the bright shining of the
Sunne of righteousnesse, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
all the lesser candles &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of this present world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 In the skill of the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> there is likenesse in
the skill of the commoditie hee
dealeth in: for as a Merchant
greatly aduanceth his estate, if
he haue skill, and insight, what
commodities are like to bee of
the quickest returne: if he know
and lay out for the best conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
commodities of euery kind:
So the Christian Merchant la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14231:22"/>
for skill, knowledge, and
sound iudgement in the matter
of Religion, whereby he may be
able to iudge aright of Doctrines
deliuered, shall grow rich in
knowledge, and to a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of faith, and full of Christian
wisedome; whence the Apostle,
<hi>(Phil. 1. 10.)</hi> prayeth, <hi>that they
may abound in all knowledge and
iudgement to discerne things that
differ:</hi> and thus they shall bee
<hi>rich,</hi> and <hi>filled with the fruits of
righteousnes, ver.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>And contrariwise, for want of
this skill, a Merchant dealing for
great bulkes, soone falleth into
great losses: But especially the
Ieweller or Lapidary by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
may soone ouerthrow his
whole estate, in respect of many
cheaters and couseners, who can
notably counterfeit Pearles, and
make themseeme very orient by
false arts, and so put away at a

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14231:23"/>
to those Apostolicall precepts:

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</note> the similitude is in
their conuersing and conferring
one with another: Euery Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
will bee speaking of his
commodities; he will make of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of his Pearles and wares of
price, that he may put them off
into other mens hands for his
owne aduantage. So the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Merchant will be talking
and conferring of this Pearle
of the Gospell; as in CANT. 5.
6. The Spouse sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndeth her daies
in breathing out the prayses of
Christ. A faithfull Christian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14231:24"/>
hide grace in a napkin, nor
hold it so close to himselfe, but
hee must communicate it, and
make offers of it to others: Such
good Merchants were the two
Disciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
of Christ, whom Christ
ioyned himselfe with, LVK. 24.
19. Such an one was <hi>Paul,</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Pearle to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and
wishing all the people were such
as he was except his bonds, ACT.
26. 29. And the reason is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
hee can communicate to
another, is his owne cleare gaine:
For this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the secular riches and
spirituall: A worldly rich man is
rich for himselfe onely, and the
more he imparteth to others, the
lesse is left for himselfe; But he
that is rich in God, is not onely
rich in and for himselfe; but these
riches doe more inrich him by
inriching others, than holding
them to himselfe: and the more
he communicateth, the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14231:24"/>
as the oyle in the cruse,
and the meale in the barrel were
not wasted with spending, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
increased.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. The ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire of increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their estate of both.</note> in the earnest desire
and endeauour of increasing
wealth, they may bee fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.
The Merchant refuseth
no paines or perill, no labour or
danger, no cost or charge, no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
by Sea or Land to purchase
such commodities, as may yeeld
him returne of profit and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
But especially Lapidaries
and Merchants, for Pearles, toyle
themselues by many weary iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and voyages, into all lands
and countryes; and haue their
factors lying abroad euery where
to meet with Pearles and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stones which are of greatest
gaine and aduantage.</p>
                  <p>So the Christian Merchant
hath an insatiable thirst and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
after the good things of the
Gospell; and with vnweariable
study and desire hee trauelleth to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14231:25"/>
euery Mart, where this Pearl may
be met withall: he apprehendeth
all opportunities, frequenteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Sermon, <hi>waiteth at the gates
of wisdome:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 8. 34.</note> he swalloweth easily
matter of labour and charge, to
become owner of the Pearle; and
he is instant in this painfull ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour:
for here it is not as in ciuil
trading, wherin many Merchants
hauing gotten money enough,
giue vp their trade, and take their
ease in the Country: but so long
as there is any good comming in,
he will be ready for it: and as the
labor of the body bringeth thirst,
so the labour of the soule increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
thirst after grace. Besides
that, grace is so sweet to a godly
heart, as a Christian Merchant
can neuer be satisfied, nor euer
giue vp as hauing enough; and as
hee knoweth the streame from
whence he sucketh, can neuer be
drawne dry: so himselfe is euer
in want of some good things, or
at the least of some measure of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14231:25"/>
it; and is euer seeking the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the same.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, they agree in the care
of preseruing, and safe keeping
the Pearls, and wealth gotten: the
Merchant doth know hee is in
continuall danger of theeues and
robbers; and that the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
the commodities bee, the
more eagerly they are assaulted:
and himselfe for them often set
vpon; sometimes with hazard,
sometimes with losse of goods,
and life it selfe: now hee is so
much the more carefull and
watchfull to barre, and locke vp
in the surest and strongest places
his richest commodities.</p>
                  <p>So the Christian Merchants are
in continuall chase and pursuit by
Satan; seducers, hereticks, false
teachers, tyrants, and al prophane
ones in the world; Besides their
owne inbred rebellion and lusts,
which fight against their owne
soules.</p>
                  <p>Now then all these lye in wait
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14231:26"/>
so much more diligently, as the
wealth is more precious than any
other, to rob these Merchants,
not of siluer or gold, but of faith
and hope, and all their graces, the
least of which is much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than gold, or the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pearles that euer lay hid in
the bowels of the earth: Yea,
themselues are so furiously assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as hardly they may escape
with goods or life, as we may see
in Christ himselfe, and in the
Martyrs, who for his sake were
bereaued, and stripped of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
comforts of life, and life it
selfe.</p>
                  <p>Hence the wise Christian
Merchant carefully fenceth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with Gods feare: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
standeth on his ground and
guard of faith: Thirdly, lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Fifthly, with Christian for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14231:26"/>
and armour, he maintaineth
the measure of grace receiued:
By all which meanes he not only
disappointeth the enemy of his
prey,<note place="margin">Non minor est virtus, quam quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere, parta <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which flyeth society, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14231:27"/>
vnnaturally putting off manhood,
and blessing himselfe in a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
curse, as any temporall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
can be?</p>
                  <p>Let all of vs therefore carry
our selues like wise Merchants.<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1.<note place="margin">Imitate wise Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in three things.</note> A wise Merchant wil know
what stock he putteth into trade;
so must we take notice what ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
or talents we haue receiued
of the Lord to trafficke withall;
what portion or proportion of
gifts we haue in our hands: and
esteem our selues worth so much
as we haue receiued of grace, and
no more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Merchant wil not
lay out his mony but for a hopeful
bargaine. <hi>Esa. 55. 2. Wherefore do
you lay out siluer, and not for
bread, and your labor without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
satisfyed? Hearken diligently
vnto me, &amp; eat that which is good,
and let your soule delight in fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi>
taxing the folly of such as
labour and dearely buy externall
food, &amp; prouision; with neglect
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14231:28"/>
of the wholesome bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of life.</p>
                  <p>So a wise Christian Merchant
will spend his time and labour on
that, which when he hath gotten
will satisfie him; which if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
in outward things, (suppose
he doth gaine them) they cannot
satisfie him.<note place="margin">Eccl 5. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>He that loueth Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shall not be satisfied, and he
that loueth riches shall bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the fruit thereof:</hi> And of all
earthly things may be said that of
<hi>Salomon,</hi> The eye is neuer satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with seeing, nor the eare
with hearing: onely godlinesse
bringeth with it contentment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Merchant will
often cast his estate, his bookes,
his shops, and his reckonings to
see whether his stock increaseth
or decayeth: If he finde himselfe
a gainer, then he is glad; if the
contrary, he is heartlesse and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull.</p>
                  <p>So the Christian Merchant is
much and often in trying his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14231:28"/>
and standing in grace; and
is most glad when hee findeth in
himself increase of grace, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
humility, faith, loue, &amp;c.
but it is a death to him to goe
backward, and to see his estate of
grace rather to decrease than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease:
hee hath no comfort in
his present vnfruitfulnesse; much
lesse in Apostacy and backe-sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
but his comfort and account
to the Lord is onely when he can
say, LVK. 19. 13. <hi>Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> 
                     <hi>thy talent

                     <note place="margin">The poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is a very rich Merchant.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let this consideration also

world, maist here make as good
a bargaine and as gainfull returne
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14231:29"/>
for thy selfe, as he that hath thou
sands of mony beyond thee. The
poore receiue the Gospell, saith
our Sauiour, that is, few but the

in spirit; for this trading is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
money, like the poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

money on the Physitians, and yet

art thou a poore man, hast

and no meanes to put them forth

them and binde them to this

way to make them prosperous in
earth, and bring them happily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heauen: <hi>Prou. 14. 26. The
feare of the Lord is an assured
strength, and his children shall

                  </p>

that first findeth not in himselfe a
want of grace. <hi>Dauid</hi> desired
grace as the <hi>thirstie ground,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 143. 6</note> and
grace is not promised, nor giuen
to any but <hi>the thirstie. Psa. 55. 1.
Euery one that thirsteth, come yee
to the waters. Psalm. 14. 2. First
they must vnderstand</hi> (namely,
their estate) and <hi>then seeke after
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. All these, and they alone
doe see the excellency,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> as well as
the need of this Pearle, and God
hath let them see, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
the worth of it. Why are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14231:31"/>
men so earnestly carried to seeke
Pearles, farre and neere, swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
insensibly all toiles, dangers,
and charges, but because they
know their worth and price, and
that if they can light on them,
they shall be wel paid for all their
labour.</p>
                  <p>Euen so, such as to whom God
hath made knowne in some mea
sure, the worth of this inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Iewell, are quickned daily to
the vnweariable inquisition after
it. <hi>Paul</hi> knew that one graine of
grace would weigh downe all
world: and therefore would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it through all perils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
through good reports or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
through wants and losses, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
of the dearest things, &amp; most
desirous in all the world; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Ignoti nulla cupido,</hi> none will
seeke that hee knoweth not, or
not any goodnesse in it.</p>
                  <p>3 They onely know,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
painfull seeking, they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
attaine the Pearle: for as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14231:32"/>
Pearles doe not lye on the face of
the ground, but are hid in the
bowels of the earth, or in the
sands; so the mysteries of the
Kingdome lye not abroad for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one to stumble vpon vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares;
but they are a hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
not discerned by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man; nay, hated by the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the flesh, and scorned by
the wisest of the world.</p>
                  <p>Besides, that this is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vpon which the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
his best blessings: if <hi>wee
dig for wisdome as for treasures:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 2. 4.</note>
which words imply, that it is not
easie to come by; hee knoweth
our nature, that we lightly set by
what we lightly come by: and if
Pearles were as common as pib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
we should as lightly set by
them as we doe by the other.</p>
                  <p>4 The godly alone see,<note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> that
without the Pearle, they cannot
by any thing else be satisfied: for
so seeking, implieth a discontent
in the want of the thing sought
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14231:32"/>
for. Common men, if they finde
health, wealth, friends, pleasures,
and the like outward things, are
well contented; corne, wine and
oyle, to cheere their hearts: But
these wise Merchants seeing
grace, no other thing contenteth
them but grace; one glimpse of
Gods countenance through Iesus
Christ, is sweet aboue all. And as
he that seeketh a Iewell, doth
looke still after it, (a thousand
things come in his way and eye,
but he passeth slightly ouer them,
and seeth them not, nor seeketh
he them) euen so doth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Merchant; and as the ciuill
Merchant attaining Pearles, doth
rest ioyful in them as in such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
as will helpe his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the world: So the godly
Merchant finding this one Pearle
of the Gospell, which is the grace
of life, goeth away reioycing, and
resteth well appaid for all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and sufferings. He was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he light vpon this Pearle, the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14231:33"/>
most vnhappy man in the world;
but now he cannot hide his ioy:
but as the poore widow, which
called in her neighbors to reioice
with her because she had found
the lost groat, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 9. so can he
neither wholly hide, nor yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
halfe the ioy he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
in his new commodity and
purchase.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But many seeke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> 
                     <hi>and that with
tears, that faile of grace, as</hi> Esau,
and many shal striue to enter <hi>(saith
Christ)</hi> and shall not be able: <hi>and</hi>
Ro. 9. 31, 32. Israel sought righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
but obtained it not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Many seeke,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but amisse,
and therefore faile:<note place="margin">Fiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of right seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pearle.</note> so <hi>Israel</hi>
sought, but not by faith. Now the
true condition of seeking as the
wise Merchant, and as the Word
directeth, standeth in fiue things:</p>
                  <p>1. With an earnest and true
loue,<note place="margin">1 Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately.</note> desire, and estimation of the
thing sought; this wilmake a man
seeke diligently, and as a thirsty
person, not coldly, carelesly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misly.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14231:33"/>
slightly, or negligently; for
such seeking shall neuer find: for
why did the Church seek Christ
so laboriously, till she found him,
but because it was he <hi>whom her
soule loued? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>an.</hi> 3. 3. The watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that went about the City,
found me, to whom I said,
<hi>Haue yee seene him whom my
soule loueth?</hi> And why did <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
seeke Christ, hauing lost him
three dayes? Because shee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him, and reioyced in his
person and presence; which made
her heart so heauy in his absence,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 42. Behold, thy father and
I haue sought thee with <hi>heauy
hearts.</hi> The Merchant, because he
loueth and esteemeth of siluer,
doth seeke it carefully and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 2. 4. and the heauenly
Merchant shall finde grace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
if he seeke it as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth siluer. Loue is laborious;
hee that loueth Christ and his
grace, will neuer cease to seeke
him, nor faile to finde him:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14231:34"/>
See the promise in <hi>Jer. 29. 12, 13
Then shall you cry vnto mee, and
you shall goe and pray vnto mee,
and I will heare you: and you shal
seeke me and finde mee, because
you shall seeke mee with all your
heart.</hi> Who soeuer then euer
meaneth to finde God and his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grace, must vnfainedly and
hartily seeke after him.</p>
                  <p>2. It must be sought in the <hi>likely
place and meanes</hi> of finding:<note place="margin">2. Wisely in the likely place of finding.</note> the
ordinary place where this Pearl is
to be found, is, the asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies of the
Saints: there God holdeth forth
his scepter, and maketh offer of
the grace of life. Where was the
Church to finde Christ with his
graces at noone,<note place="margin">Cant. 1. 7.</note> in her thirst, but
in the steps of the shepherds?
And these assemblies are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs
of heauen, called therefore
the <hi>Kingdome of grace:</hi> and he
that refuseth the good offers of
grace, in the word, sacraments,
prayer, hearing, reading, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and the like, shall neuer find
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14231:34"/>
it. No wise Merchant will slacke
any good opportunity of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his estate; now the likely
meanes in wise seeking are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to be vsed, as</p>
                  <p>1 To search the euidence of
the Pearle, and this euidence is
contained in the Scriptures, <hi>John
5. Search the Scriptures, for they
witnessee of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the grant of it is from
heauen by prayer. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
goe boldly to the Throne of
grace, that we may find mercy
and grace to helpe in time of
need, HEB. 4. 16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the couenant is by
the application of these meanes
singed, and deliuered, yea and
witnessed by the blessed Spirit of
God, by a blessed change in the
beleeuing heart; by mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and subduing the corruption
of nature; by heauenly motions,
heauenly mindednesse, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conuersation, standing not in
a shell, a forme or shew, but in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14231:35"/>
the kernill, power, and substance
of sound godlinesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">

and principally, yea onely sought
and that for it selfe: it must bee
sought first in <hi>time:</hi> As <hi>Psa. 63. 3.
Early in the morning will I seeke
thee.</hi> The Isralites must seeke
<hi>Manna,</hi> the first thing they doe
in the morning. <hi>Esau</hi> seeketh, but
too late; the foolish Virgins doe
knock, but the doore is shut. 2. It
must be sought in the first place.
<hi>Mat. 6. 33. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eeke ye first the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen, &amp; the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof:</hi> Seek neither other
things before it, as worldlings,
nor other things with it, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Epicures, who would grasp
heauen and earth together; nor
yet seeke it for other things, as
Hypocrites, who professe the
Gospell for fauour, credit, profit,
or some other (in respect of that)
base things. But seek it alone for
it selfe, and in sincerity; for only
such seeking findeth it: Neuer
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14231:35"/>
will Christ be sought for loaues,
nor can the same eye looke to
heauen and earth together.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Humbly</note> it must be sought <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
that is, first out of thy selfe: a
man that wanteth water, wil goe
to the fountaine; the waters of
grace must flow from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and wel-head, Christ Iesus:
seek it therfore in him and from
him. The eye of faith spyeth it in
him, and the hand of faith doth
take it vp from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, it must bee sought
with godly sorrow &amp; repentance
for sin.</hi> Isa. 1. 16. Wash you, make
you cleane, take away the euill of
your works from before mine eies,
cease to doe euill.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, with reformation of
heart and life. <hi>Ps. 14. 4. The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of iniquity</hi> are vnfit and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
seekers of grace.<note place="margin">5. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it must be songht <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly:
Mary</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> neuer
gaue ouer seeking Christ, vntill
they found him, nor the Church
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14231:36"/>
till she found him: neither must
we giue ouer seeking, hauing
sound grace, for it is not in this
seeking, as in other things, where
hauing found, we rest contented,
and seeke no more: but here ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
found the thing we sought,
we must seeke still: for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is euer wanting of grace, if
not in whole, yet in part; if not
in substance, yet in some degree
and measure of it: and therefore
this worke (as the husband mans)
is neuer at an end.</p>
                  <p>This must needs condemne
many of vs,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> of extreame folly and
sinne: how few of vs haue sought
after grace as after siluer? for
siluer we will take great paines,
rise early, goe to bed late, and eat
the bread of carefulnesse: but
when doe we so for grace? for
siluer we will trauell many miles
on horse, and foot, to a market or
faire, if we can but gaine or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
halfe a handfull of siluer:
but for grace we will hardly step
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14231:36"/>
out of doores, or bestow the least
paines, to frequent the places of
Gods Exchange. In seeking sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
euery man will seeke a good
penny-worth: he is carefull that
none ouer-reach him: he parteth
with his money as warily as may
be: and will be ready to lay hold
on a good bargaine, when it is
offered. In the matter of grace,
how fearefully doe many thrust
it away with both hands, wilfully
forsaking their owne mercy?
<hi>Jona. 2. 8. They that wait vpon
lying vanities, forsake their owne
mercy:</hi> that is, refuse the bargaine
of eternall life offered, almost
forced vpon them and others,
that seemed to haue receiued a
good summe of grace, foolishly
depart with it, and fall away ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quite or wholly, or else from
their measure and their first loue,
these men are farre from see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
grace, and farther from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it.</p>
                  <p>This should stirre vp our thirst<note place="margin">Vse 2, 2</note>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:14231:37"/>
after grace, to expresse our selues
wise Merchants seazed on the
Pearle, which that we may ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
seeke after, let vs consider
these fiue motiues.</p>
                  <p>1. Christ seeketh vs,<note place="margin">5. Motiues to prouok vs earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to seeke after grace</note> and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vs to seek him; &amp; shal Christ
seeke thee for thy good, and not
thou seeke him for thine owne
good? But Christ seeketh vs as a
Hen that gathereth her chickins
vnder her wings, MAT. 23. 37<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and woe vnto vs if we remaine
vngathered. The father of the
prodigall, goeth out to meet his
sonne returning home, to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
vs to goe out of our selues
to seeke him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the fearefull reuenge
against such as seeke not, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after God, should moue vs
to seeke him: as ZIPH. 1. 6. in
the fourth verse, I will <hi>cut off the
remnant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aal;</hi> and in the sixt,
And them that turne backe from
the Lord, and <hi>those that haue not
sought the Lord, and inquired for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14231:37"/>
him.</hi> And if they vnder the Law
were so reuenged, how much
more shall we liuing vnder the
Gospell,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>if wee neglect so great
saluation?</hi> If the Gospell be now
hid, it is hid to them that perish,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. Oh what a fearefull
case is it, that the Gospell should
serue for the conuiction of men,
and not for their conuersion? Oh
thrice vnhappy man, that shall
peruert this so aboundant grace
to his owne destruction: and yet
the plenty of Gods grace in the
Gospel shal condemne thousands
that neuer required or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it.</p>
                  <p>3. Thou shouldest seeke grace
from God, but he seeketh to pin
his grace on thy sleeue: God brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
home the Gospell to thy
house and doores; hee sendeth
forth his seruants, he continueth
to seeke thee by continuing the
meanes &amp; the season of grace: he
seeketh thee daily by his Word,
his Ministers, his blessings, his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14231:38"/>
by the motions of the
spirit, by the checks of thine
owne conscience, and wilt thou
not seeke being sought vnto? da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
thou receiue such grace still
in vaine? 2 COR. 6. 5. or turne it
to wantonnesse? <hi>Jud.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, of this saluation the
Prophets <hi>search diligently, 1 Pet.
1.</hi> 10. and shall wee to whom it
more specially belongeth, not so
much as aske or inquire after it?
or shall we thrust it away as the
Iewes did, ACT. 13. 46. but not
without the most fearefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
that euer hapened to any
nation vnder the heauens, vnder
which they lye at this day?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, for a man to abide de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of desire and endeuour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
grace, sheweth that Satan,
the God of the world, worketh
mightily in such an one, and hath
him in his power to hood-winke
him, and hide from him the grace
of the Gospell, that the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this Pearle should neuer
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14231:38"/>
shine to him, lest he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
and be saued: See 2 <hi>Cor. 4.
3,</hi> 4. This of the first action:
<hi>Who hauing found a Pearle of
great price.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second action of the wise
Merchant, is, he findeth an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Pearle; Of the Pearle, and
of the excellency we haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
Now are we in this part
onely to speake something of the
finding of it. And by the Pearle,
being meant the grace of the
Gospell, as we haue heard, wee
learne this Doctrine:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That</hi> seekers of grace shall find

Why?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Faithfull seeking can neuer

aboue all we are able to
aske or thinke: His power is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to supply all our wants:

many seeke one thing, but finde

to seeke health, thou maist meet

seeke law and iustice, thou maist
finde iniustice and oppression:
at some friends hands thou maist
seeke fauour and friendship, but
finde hatred and enmity, as <hi>Joseph</hi>
sought at his brethrens, but findes
them foes and enemies.</p>
                  <p>But in matters of grace, thou
shalt finde the same things thou

                  <p>Here is also a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
seeking things at Gods

in the example of the vniust Iudg.
A poore man asketh at mans
hands mercy, and misseth of it:
knocke at mans doore, it is not
alway, open: But the gate of grace
is neuer shut; Gods eare is alway
open, &amp; as a fauorite sitteth in the

so long as thou canst seeke, thou

hide his face for a time, and seem
to locke vp his mercy from thee,
yet vphold thy selfe in seeking,
and thou shalt find in due season,
<hi>Psal. 9. 9, 10. The Lord also will

Wantest thou strength against
temptations? Seeke by prayer the
grace of Christian fortitude: be
strong in the cry of prayer; and as
a theefe will runne away when
the true man maketh a noyse and
out-cry, so will Satan vpon this
noyse of feruent prayer cease his
assault. Wantest thou peace of
conscience, chearefulnesse in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or suffering? wouldest thou
see a sweet looke from God? or
needst thou any other blessing for
life or godlinesse? Seeke it with

hands of Christ, and would not be

poore woman by her importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
preuailed in her suit with the

how much more shall faithfull
importunity preuaile with the

                  <p>But my seeking is so weak and

                  <p>Or art prophane, and scornest
the blessing, as <hi>Esau.</hi>
                  </p>

of them that hate them that

                  <p>Or art idle, and seekest slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or formally; and can God at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that praier, or request, which
thou carelesly and formally castest
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14231:45"/>
out, and thy selfe attendest not?
And here numbers of men lye
vnder iust reproofe; as,</p>
                  <p>1. Such as neuer spent so much
labour in seeking grace, as <hi>Saul</hi>
did in seeking his Fathers Asses,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 4.</p>
                  <p>2. They that neuer spent so
much time to find it, as they could
for a handful of siluer, &amp; yet hope
they haue it, or shal haue it. When
didst thou breake thy sleepe, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
thy selfe, put thy selfe into
all weathers by night and by day,
for the Word, as thou hast for
wealth? When wast thou so good
and thrifty an husband for thy

for grace before thou prizest it:
and be sure thou hast it not, who
so vnder-valuest it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> let vs examine our
selues whether by all our seeking
wee haue found the Pearle, and
that by these rules:<note place="margin">5. Notes of one that by seeking hath found the Pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>1. He hath found by seeking,
who still seekes to find, for it is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14231:46"/>
not here as in seeking other
things: here the finder giueth not
ouer seeking: but the more hee
findeth, the more hee seeketh;
here is an vnsaciable couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and a couetousnesse war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, much ioy and large
affections to expresse the sense of
so great a commodity: the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of Gods Spirit witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
our adoption; once receiue
it, and it refresheth the soule
with ioy vnspeakeable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 5. and this ioy will
not be hid, as in the woman fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the lost groat.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Pearle once found,
there followeth a contempt of
the world, a killing of the cares
of this life, a fencing from the
loue of earthly things: there is
no true content in anything else,
he that hath found this Pearle, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemeth
all other things, euen
the best of that the world so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mireth,
dung in comparison of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:14231:46"/>
Fourthly, being so rich a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
it enableth to good
workes and (as no other Pearle
can) it worketh the will also to
be abundant in good workes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
in the fruits of the spirit,
in the fruits of Sanctity, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of life.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is of so precious ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as it is in euery one that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it, an antidote against all the
poyson of sinne, the grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
presently expelleth it:
the grace of patience is a salue
for euery fore: the grace of faith
is a most soueraigne Cordiall; it
is of vertue to renouate the
whole man, and all the parts of
the man: it cleareth his sight
daily, it maketh him quicke of
hearing, it sharpeneth all his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in diuine things; it preserueth
his stomack and appetite to Gods
word: it purgeth out his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,

                     <hi>to

him, if thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> be perfect, go and
sell all that thou hast, and giue it
to the poore, and thou shalt haue
treasure in heauen, and come and
follow me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Papists build a state of
perfection vpon voluntary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty:<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
and hold it a counsell onely
fit for perfect Christians, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14231:48"/>
farre more meritorious than the
keeping of the whole Law.</p>
                  <p>But first to answer them, and
then the question.</p>
                  <p>1. It is a friuolous conceit to
thinke, that any man may come
to an higher estate of happinesse,
by some other meanes than by
keeping the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is absurd to think
that any worke can be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
done toward saluation, which
is without the walke &amp; compasse
of the law, which is so perfect,
that cursed is he that doth dare to
adde to it, or detract any thing
from it.</p>
                  <p>3. Christ desired no more of
the young man, than he did of his
Disciples, who said, vers. 27. we
haue <hi>left all to follow thee,</hi> and
yet <hi>Peter</hi> had an house still, and
<hi>John,</hi> to which he tooke the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore Christ would
hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the young man to part with
all, which he could not hold, with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14231:48"/>
his loue and affection to Christ
himselfe, and the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that which Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of this Iusticiary, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deuised Euangelicall counsell
aboue the law; but a duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the law: the summe of
which, is, <hi>Thou shalt loue the Lord
thy God with all thy heart:</hi> and
whereas he had boasted, that he
had kept all the law; Christ doth
send him backe againe to the
law, to let him see his want of
loue, both to God and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
to God, if the loue of his
friends hinder him from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, whom hee confesseth a
teacher from God: And want
of loue to man, if at Christs
word hee will not part with
his mony, especially if not at
Christ his especiall commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>So as this is not a counsell to
some perfect recluses or orders
of wilfull men; but a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
to all Christians, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14231:49"/>
must striue to perfection. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
2. 6. And we speake wisdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them <hi>that are perfect:</hi>
who must not onely leaue goods
and lands, and houses for Christ,
and the Gospell, but must hate
father, mother, wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
brethren, sisters, and their
owne life, if they cannot hold
them with Christ.</p>
                  <p>So much to answer the Papists.</p>
                  <p>Now to the question.</p>
                  <p>1. Who can deny wealth to be
the gift of God, if it beheld with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
couetousnesse, confidence,
pride, and subordinate to heauen
and heauenly things? Or who can
deny but riches may become
helps to heauenly Tabernacles?
who can deny but good men may
both haue them, and vse them?
<hi>Abraham</hi> was a man of great
possessions, and <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi>
men of most great wealth: and
yet godly men, and poore of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
goods therfore in themselues
are not to be cast away: but first
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14231:49"/>
in comparison,<note place="margin">Wealth in foure cases to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</note> rather than wee
will not attaine, and retaine the
Pearle of the Gospell, we must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
all we haue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when they proue an
impediment to our calling, and
holy professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we must renounce
them,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 25</note> as <hi>Moses</hi> in this case refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be the sonne of <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
daughter, and to suffer with Gods
people: a traueller may carry a
staffe to helpe him in his iourney,
but not to ouer-load himselfe:
and he may beare some mony in
his purse for his charges, but not
burthen himselfe with it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in <hi>affection</hi> alwayes
we must renounce them, and hold
them retiredly and weignedly, <hi>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the world as not vsing it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor 7. 3.</note> Let
them be in our hands, not in our
hearts; to lay downe, or lay out;
not to lay vp, or lay vp our hearts
with them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, actually, but not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called;
we must leaue them, not
of our owne accord, but called by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14231:50"/>
God, <hi>non sponte sed vocati:</hi> let
vs alwayes see wee haue a good
ground, as if tyrants, or persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
keepe vs from inioying ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christ, or our owne estate;
then in this choyse, we must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a poore estate in Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a rich estate in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And buyeth it.]</hi> Our Sauiour
vseth this word <hi>buying,</hi> not to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
that we can make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
paiment, or merit, to
purchase eternall life: for, first,
that is infinite, we finite, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
these is no proportion.
Secondly, it is a free gift of God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Thirdly, it is a buying,
but <hi>without money,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esa. 55. 1.</note> and money
worth. And <hi>the poore</hi> are called
to buy it, who haue no money to
layout for it. Fourthly, this Pearle
is such a commodity, as neither
men nor Angels can giue any due
price for. Fiftly, we can giue God
nothing but his owne.</p>
                  <p>But Christ here speaketh figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely,
namely, that this wife
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14231:50"/>
Merchant dealeth as a buyer;<note place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man resembleth a buyer in 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things.</note> first
he seeth the want of Gods grace
and Christs merits: the thirsty are
called to buy, <hi>Esay</hi> 55. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as a buyer, he <hi>periseth,</hi>
valueth, and casteth the worth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
esteemeth Christ at the highest
rate, and all things else in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of him, losse, and dung,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as a buyer he maketh
an exchange; not of money, nor
money worth, but vseth all good
indeuour, and labour, by prayer,
and diligence, and the vse of all
good meanes, to obtain the grace
of the Gospell. Which price
God doth set vpon grace, and on
which condition, an exchange is
made. The beleeuer putteth ouer
his sinnes to Christ, and receiueth
righteousnes from Christ. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 21. For he hath made <hi>him to
be sinne for vs that knew no sinne,
that we should be made the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
of God in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the bargaine made,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14231:51"/>
is earnested; so the beleeuer, able
to giue nothing to God, taketh
from God the earnest of his Spirit,
in some sauing graces; by which
the whole bargain of eternall life
is assured vnto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From this selling all,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> possessions and his life
was nos deare,<note place="margin">Acts 20.</note> so he might finish
his course with ioy. And why?</p>
                  <p>1. Such sound iudgement is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
vnto euery sound Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note>
as he thinketh nothing so dear
to him as Christ, and his grace:
and doth suppose himselfe rich
indeed, if he attain naked Christ;
and the dearest things are base in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14231:51"/>
this comparison. The Church of
<hi>Laodicea</hi> wil neuer buy gold and
white raiment, so long as her
iudgement is blinded, till she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
her eyes with eye-salue to
see; and seeing once the worth,
she is content to be at any paines
for it. The text implieth, that no
lesse paines be made for wisdome
than that of most industrious Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who take long and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
iournies, and voyages by Sea
and land for Pearles, and swallow
all paines and perils in hope of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Christian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that he shall be no loser by
the bargaine; other Merchants
buying great commodities know
not whether they shal be gainers
or no: and many seeke Pearles
with infinite losses &amp; finde them
not: But here is a certaine and
an vndoubted gaine, for whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
forsaketh house, wife, lands,
liberty, childeren, and life for
Christs sake and the Gospell, shall
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14231:52"/>
receiue <hi>an hundred-fold with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,
and in the world to come
life euerlasting:</hi> here is vsury e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
not tenne in the hundred,
but an hundred for tenne: haue
this Pearle, and want nothing;
want this Pearle, and haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this putteth a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene soundnesse and
hypocrisie; the hypocrite can sell
much for Gods fauour. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 6.
they will giue thousands of rams,
and ten thousands of riuers of
oyle: and their first borne, but
wil not part with their sinnes. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi>
and <hi>Saphira</hi> can part with
three parts of their portion: but
soundnesse esteemeth the Pearle
better than the whole, were it
the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because it seeth
Christ forsaking all, liberty, life,
wealth, heauen and happinesse
for it; in the way of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
grace in the heart doth hold
it selfe bound to forsake all for
Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:14231:52"/>
This condemneth foolish Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
who make a base recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Pearle: esteeming
the Gospell worth nothing. The
Gadarens accounted euery pig,
and base profit better than Christ
and his Sermons: Prophane <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau</hi>
despised the blessing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of pottage: There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
scornfull Merchants, who
scoffe at such simplicity, as to
forgoe profits, and delights, for
vaine conceits, as to strip ones
selfe of the pleasures of life, to
runne many miles to Sermons,
where is none at home: Others
would buy the Pearle, if by it
they might gaine ease, reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and wealth, like the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
that will take their Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

Religion by their gettings,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 14.</note> and

                  </p>
                  <p>2. Wee may see it is not so
easie a matter to haue part in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14231:53"/>
Gospell, as most men thinke: that
vtterly deceiue themselues in
this commodity: and this is the
cause why so few respect it.
1. Some men thinke they haue it
because they haue heard of it, but
there is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
finding and buying, as
betweene calling and answering.
2. Some heare, and like, and wish
and praise it; but as in a faire they
see many rich commodities, but
they passe by them and bargaine
for none: so many approue of
Doctrines in generall, but lay out
nothing, nor lay aside any lust:
they can commend a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
but will be sure it shall doe
them no good.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there are others that
come neerer, cheapen, loue and
bid somewhat; but as hard chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
nothing neere the matter:
rich men can cast some of their
superfluity sometimes to good v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
but not as the widow that had
but two mites and cast in all: this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14231:53"/>
were too hard a bargaine.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, some would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
some of their sinnes, but
not all: others will doe some du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as come to the Church, hear,
pray, sometimes read at home,
and reproue sinne: but come to
chargeable or dangerous duties,
to shew loue to Christ in time
of danger or disgrace, they are
backward, and draw in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
horne for feare they be losers
by him.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore learne to hold
Christ,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> and the Gospell as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
iewell, or pearle worth hauing;
and to thinke our selues rich if
we sel our selues out of all, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
the Pearle: let vs thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
our religion, and shut the
mouthes of our aduersaries, that
say we will leaue nothing for our

2. He changeth his owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
for Christs merits apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

them away like dung: and with

righteousnesse, ciuill ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and good workes, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
in the skale: but all is too
light, and found losse weighed
with Christ. So bring Wealth,
liberty, friends, life it selfe, into
the sight of a sound beleeuer: and
if he must leaue these, or Christ
and his Gospell, farewell they;
he soone maketh his choyce: As

the Mariners cast out their wares
with their owne hands, and the
tacklings out of the ship: so wee
must cast away all in comparison
of Christ, our Lord and our life.
Where note, that the Papist that
cannot disclaime his owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
shall misse of Christs.</p>
                  <p>2. He goeth away reioycing,
all his affections are on it; his

This is also a comfort to poore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

they haue no money: nothing is

Christ and his benefits freely

because the sense of misery was
deepe;<note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> hee striues with God,
with great, vehement, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse
of spirit, ingeminating
his petition in this twelfth vers.
Rising vp in his requests by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
as one that meaneth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
with God (as another <hi>Iacob)</hi>
and not let him goe till he haue
blessed him; and therefore first
he desireth the Lord to <hi>heare his
Prayer.</hi> But because the prayers
of the Saints are often faint and
feeble, and without any strong
motion, he desires the Lord to
<hi>hearken to his cry:</hi> the sense of
his need vrged strong cryes, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uency,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14231:60"/>
and importunity. And
further, because euery strong cry
is not heard, vnlesse it proceed
from a broken and contrite spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
He prayeth the LORD not
to keepe <hi>silence at his teares:</hi>
well hee knew that prayers of
faith, watered with teares of
godly sorrow, are eloquent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaders,
to dray a comfortable
answer from God; they cannot
suffer him to sit silent long; who
hath prepared both a bottle to
reserue them in, and an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefe
to wipe them away
from the eyes of his children.

Now the words read are a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his earnest request, drawne
from the acknowledgement of
the frailty, vanity, and breuity of
his life, laid downe by a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
taken from strangers or Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims,

                  <p>In tying which words with the
former, it may be asked, first,
what force can there bee in this
reason, to moue or incline God to
mercy, because he was a <hi>stranger
with him;</hi> it might rather imply,
that God should the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange

                  </p>
                  <p>I answer: 1. The Hebrew phrase
I am a stranger <hi>with thee,</hi> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as much as to say, I am a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<hi>before thee:</hi> or <hi>in thy sight.</hi>
And not that he was a stranger in
affection, or conuersation from
God, as the wicked, who are said
to be <hi>strange childred,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 58. 3</note> and <hi>stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14231:61"/>
from the wombe.</hi> For how
could <hi>Dauid</hi> be such a stranger,
who set <hi>the Lord euer before him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 16. 8.</note>
and <hi>at his right hand,</hi> that hee
might not sinne against him?</p>
                  <p>2. As it is a confession and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of his owne humility and
sense of his misery, it is a motiue
to mercy: as if he had said, I am a
stranger and need helpe, because
as a stranger, I lye open to many
iniuries and inconueniences: but
thou art the God of the abiect;
&amp; thy property is as to cast down
the proud, so to raise vp such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
soules as I am, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
heare my prayers, cryes and
teares.</p>
                  <p>3. As it ascribeth vnto the Lord
the honour of mercy, it is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
to mercy; for holy <hi>Dauid</hi>
puts the Lord in mind of his own
gracious inclination and affection
to strangers;<note place="margin">Exo. 22. 11</note> for he hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vs to be kinde to strangers;<note place="margin">Leui. 19. 33</note>
and hath in speciall manner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
the protection of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.<note place="margin">Deu. 10. 19.</note>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:14231:62"/>
                     <hi>Ps. 146. 6. The Lord keepeth
the strangers:</hi> and therefore his
faith binding God after a sort to
his owne law and promise, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
himselfe of Gods mercy,
because he is a stranger.</p>
                  <p>4. As it is an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his own impotency, and
the misery of his life, it pleadeth
strongly for mercy: as if hee had
said; Thou knowest, Lord, that
I am a stranger here, and so long
as I am so, I cannot but carry a
burden of flesh, and a body of
sinne, and daily thereby deserue
thy most heauy displeasure: and
therefore I beseech thee, be not
so extreame against me, as in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
thou mayest; but conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my frailty, mingle my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
with mercy. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
I discerne also by my bodily
weaknesse and infirmity, that I
am a stranger here, and of short
continuance, I pray thee remoue
thy hand, and let not all my life
be miserable, but <hi>stay thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14231:62"/>
from me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 13.</note> that <hi>I may recouer
my strength, before I goe hence,
and bee no more.</hi> And vpon the
same ground, <hi>Iob</hi> makes the same
request: <hi>Let him cease and leaue
off from mee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 10. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>that I may take a
little comfort, before I goe and
shall not returne, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may bee asked,
How can <hi>Dauid</hi> vse this as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for his recouery, which hee
vsed before, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. for the haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his death; for because his
life was short and miserable,
therefore he desires he might die
in all haste.</p>
                  <p>To which I snswer, That
great difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Dauid</hi> foiled by flesh, and
<hi>Dauid</hi> supported by the Spirit,
for wee haue in him lying vnder
the temptation, an instance of our
owne strong-hearted corruption;
which out of a good proposition,
can draw most dangerous and
wicked conclusions; For,
out of the consideration of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14231:63"/>
the shortnesse of his life, he could
draw conclusions of murmuring,
impatience, and almost of despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
But now <hi>Dauid</hi> is another
man, and the Spirit of grace hath
conquered those assaults, &amp; now
he can out of the same premises,
draw the cleane contrary conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
to support his faith, patience
and dependance vpon God. For
such is the wisedome of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that he can draw holy, sweet,
&amp; comfortable conclusions from
those principles and grounds,
from which flesh and corruption
vseth to sucke sinne and poyson;
and teacheth the Saints so to doe.</p>

trauelling homewards vnto it: for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14231:63"/>
these two conditions are proper
to a stranger: First, that he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

from his owne home an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;
thus was <hi>Abraham</hi> a
stranger in <hi>Canaan.</hi> Secondly, that
he is trauelling home as a Pilgrim
to his owne Country; Thus was
<hi>Iacob</hi> a stranger, whose whole life
was a trauel in forrain Countries,
out of any certaine and settled
dwelling, as himselfe professeth,
<hi>Gen. 47. 9. The whole time of my

thirty yeeres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Who is this stranger? <hi>Dauid</hi>
saith, I am a stranger, which may
seemestrange, if we consider that
<hi>Dauid</hi> was a King, and that in his
own Country, and that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Iudea;</hi> in comparison of
whose inhabitants all the world
besides were strangers, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 27

went vp to the mount of <hi>Oliues</hi>

hee any meritorious iourney in a

that, he was King of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>

There was now no Sepulcher of
our Lord to visit, nor no Image of
our Lady, and yet hee professeth
himselfe a stranger.</p>
                  <p>3. But where was <hi>Dauid</hi> a
stranger? Himselfe saith, <hi>Before
thee:</hi> that is, wheresoeuer hee is
before God, there he is a stranger:
not in another mans kingdome or
Countrey, as of <hi>Moabits</hi> or <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims,</hi>
but in his owne Country,
in <hi>Canaan</hi> he is a stranger; yea,
at <hi>Bethlem</hi> in the City of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:14231:64"/>
and in <hi>Sion,</hi> the Fort of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
hee is a stranger. This hee
expresseth, <hi>Psalme 119. 19. I
am a stranger vpon earth:</hi> that
is, in euery part of the earth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in mine owne house, in mine
owne bed, in mine owne body
and bosome I am a stranger <hi>with
thee.</hi> Wherein the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
both acknowledgeth the
Lord the proprietary,<note place="margin">Leu 25. 23.</note> of <hi>whom
he held his Countrey</hi> and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
For it is as if he had said,
I am a stranger in thy Countrey:
my Countrey is thy Countrey,
and thy Countrey is my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
and now I doe but soiourne
a while <hi>with thee</hi> in thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
till I returne home and
dwell <hi>with thee</hi> in my Country.
As also hee infoldeth a motiue,
why the LORD should incline
his eare to his Prayer, and shew
him fauour, because hee is a
stranger in the Lords Countrey:
and therefore committing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the protection and safe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14231:65"/>
conduct of the Lord of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he doubteth not, but to finde
grace in his eyes, &amp; by his means
a comfortable passage, til he come
happily to the end of his way. For
who should heare the complaints
of a soiourner, but he with whom
he soiourneth?</p>
                  <p>4. But is it otherwise with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
now, than with other men? no
surely, but he beareth part in the
common condition of his fathers.
Although he was deare to God, &amp;
the King of Gods people; yet he
is no better than his Fathers; he is
a stranger <hi>as all his Fathers were.</hi>
He meaneth not the fathers of his
flesh only, who were all dead, and
gone to their iournies end, but the
Fathers of his faith also; these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Patriarchs, <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
&amp; their posterity, which were
the holy seed; who in their times
accounted themselues <hi>strangers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb 11. 13 14</note>
&amp; <hi>declared</hi> themselues so to be,

they would not cumber the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
with buildings or purchases; but
betooke themselues to poore and
portable tents, which were soone
pitched vp, and as soone taken

contented to wander vp &amp; down
as Pilgrims; restlesly from place to

Christian is a <hi>Gershom:</hi> that

in respect, first of the place, for

                     <hi>Gal. 6. 14.
The world is crucified to me, and
I vnto the world.</hi> The very light
of nature saw and said, that nature
hath afforded vs in this world on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an Inne, and not a dwelling:
and should not grace much more
acquaint vs with Gods decree
and ordinance, which is, that man
should be a while in the world, as
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14231:67"/>
in a way to passe him vnto his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
estate elsewhere, or at most,
but a traueller in an Inne, which
hee is ready to leaue the next
morrow.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in their owne account
and confession they are strangers,
<hi>Heb. 11. 13. All</hi> these <hi>confessed
that they were strangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
vpon earth.</hi> And in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the world also they are
strangers, which vseth them
strangely &amp; coursly, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was
a stranger to his brethren, <hi>Ps. 69.

world, it would know them, loue
them, and hug them in their lap:
they being strangers, it is another
Egypt to Gods first borne, and
knoweth them not but to vexe
and oppresse them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in respect of the short
time of thier continuance, for as
a stranger abides not in a strange
place (as the natiues do) but hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
through his way, and so with
his time cutteth &amp; shortneth his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14231:67"/>
iourney; so the godly haue here
no abiding city,<note place="margin">Heb. 13 14</note> neither is this
their resting place. For this cause
the whole militant Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Tabernacle: &amp; the Saints cal
the time of their life for the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
&amp; discontinuance of it,<note place="margin">Psal. 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </note> but
a <hi>being in this tabernacle,</hi> because
first,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 13</note> as a tabernacle is but a soior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
place, set vp for a shift to
hide our selues for a small while,
as the souldier hides himselfe in a
sconce or tent onely for the time
of a siege at the longest: so is it
with the tabernacle of the body,
set vp for a small time, not so
much for it self as for the inmate,
the soule which is contained in
it. Secondly, as a tabernacle is a
moueable tent, pitched for a day;
ouer night is set vp, and perhaps
the next day the stakes are pulled
vp, and the cords are slacked, and
the conering is folded vp: no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
is it with the tabernacle
of the body, which no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
whether it shall stand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14231:68"/>
till the next morrow, no,
nor till the next houre.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as a Tabernacle is only
a couering, but hath no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to settle vpon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> so <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh
of our bodies, as houses <hi>of clay,
whose foundation is in the dust:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob. 4. 19.</note>
that if God did not fasten the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
cords of them to his appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time, euery blast would ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
them euery moment.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the godly are strangers
here below in respect of their
businesse, &amp; imployment; a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is vnacquainted with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the place where he takes
vp his Inne, he meddles not with
the gouernment, the offices, the
passages of causes in the towne
where he lyeth as a stranger; but
intendeth his iourney, &amp; only ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
how he may passe through:
and if he haue any busines there,
it is only to aduance his estate at
home in his own country. And so
it is with the godly; they estrange
themselues as much as may bee
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14231:68"/>
from the world, &amp; the common
courses of it: their callings they
cast not off, because they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to abide in them with
moderate care, to prouide for
themselues, and theirs. And for
earthly things they cannot bee
without them, while they haue a
life to maintain by them; but yet
they meddle no more with them
than needs must, and in the midst
of their earthly businesse are not
earthly minded.<note place="margin">Col 3. 10.</note> They are Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses
of another Corporation, &amp;
all their trading and traffick here
is to make themselues a rich and
sure estate there. They haue a
chiefe businesse to doe, which
they principally intend, namely,
to seeke the kingdome of God,
and the righteousnes of it; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of their sinnes, to beleeue in
the Son of God, &amp; to make their
election sure: whereto they giue
all diligence, as they are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the godly are strangers in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14231:69"/>
respect of their affection: for, as
strangers long after home, and
where euer their bodies be, their
hearts and mindes are not there,
but at home where their deare
friends and estates are: So is it
with the Saints, whose mindes,
and meditations, and conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are in heauen before-hand:
for there is their Fathers house,
and there is their inheritance,
there is Iesus Christ their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and no maruel if their hearts
be there where their treasure is.
The worldling hath his whole
portion in this life, and therefore
hee bestowes all his heart, his
thoughts, his cares, his desires aud
indeuors vpon the world; he runs
after it with a full desire. But it
cannot be so with the godly man
who is minded as was good <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,
2.</hi> 3. Who although his
person was in the King of <hi>Persia</hi>
his Court, and was a neere atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
at the Kings Table, yet his
heart was at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14231:69"/>
                     <hi>Daniel,</hi> who while he was in the
land of his captiuity, yet he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his windowes euery day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But are not wicked
men strangers here vpon earth, as
well as the godly?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Wicked men and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
are indeed strangers here,
if we looke towards God, they
are strangers with him, strangers
from the Couenant of God; and
stranhers from the life and waies
of God. Or if wee consider the
time of their continuance here,
they haue no more continuance
here than others: they haue no
Leases of their liues, nor no surer
holds of their estates than others
haue. The rich Glutton heard,
<hi>Thon foole, this night shall they
take away thy soule,</hi> and all. Or
if we consider the place in which
they liue, they are strangers;
for the East winde takes away
and hurls them out of their place
as easily as any other.<note place="margin">Iob 27. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> And

houses &amp; possessions which knew
them once, shall know them no
more, but take in other strangers
for a terme of dayes, as they took
in them.</p>
                  <p>But wicked men are not stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
as the godly are, in 4 respects</p>
                  <p>1. In their owne account, or
conceit; for, though their estate
be as vnstable as any others, yet
haue they a strong co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
and of taking their rest
for many yeares. They are descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to be such as put off the euill
day, &amp; make leagues with death,
&amp; are hardly brought to confesse
themselues to bee pilgrims and
strangers.</p>
                  <p>2. In the worlds account they
be not strangers, but neighbors &amp;
Towne-dwellers. The world
knowes them, &amp; loueth them as
her own: yea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ulleth them in her
lap as her children, shee graceth
them, enricheth them, &amp; aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14231:70"/>
them as men of best deserts.
In a word, she thinketh nothing
she hath too good for such fast
friends, and diligent seruants.</p>
                  <p>3. In their owne affection they
be no strangers; for how can they
considering they haue no other
portion but here? <hi>Ps.</hi> 17. 14. How
can they but <hi>mind earthly</hi> things,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19.</note>
to whom God hath shewed no
better? How can they but giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their affections, &amp; bury their
hearts in earth, &amp; drowne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in the delights of it, that
haue no other God, no other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen?
What man wil be willing to
giue ouer a broken title, till he be
assured and seated in a better?
which because they are not, like
profane <hi>Esaus,</hi> they hunger after
pottage, let the blessing goe
where it will.</p>
                  <p>4. In their course and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they doe not <hi>declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be strangers.</hi> Al their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
their paines, their sweat &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour,
is to get a sure &amp; conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14231:71"/>
estate in earth: they treasure
all in earth; If they can encrease
their corn, their wine, their oyle,
their coyne, their commodities,
they rest as in a good portion; sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or neuer seeking in earnest
that <hi>good part</hi> which should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be taken from them, nor they
from it, if once they could attain
it. Thus much of the Doctrine, &amp;
this question. The Vse followeth.</p>
                  <p>First, in that the godly man is a
stranger and Pilgrim here, wee
learne sundry duties. As first to
practise Christian sobriety, in the
affecting,<note place="margin">Christian sob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iety in 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affecting.</note> enioying, and vsing the
things of this life. For, 1. a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in his way affects not, desires
not, lookes not for great things
for himselfe in the City he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelleth
thorow; hee lightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
the honours, offices, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues,
and priuileges of it: his
chiefe desires and affections are
elsewhere: all the priuilege hee
expecteth there, is how to passe
quietly and safely through: Enen
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14231:71"/>
so ought the Christian Pilgrim by
the weaned carriage of himselfe
towards things below,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 14</note> declare
plainly (as the Patriarchs did) that
he seeketh a Countrey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seekest thou great things for
thy selfe</hi> (saith the Lord to <hi>Baruk)
seeke them not.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 45. 5.</note> And why must he
not? because he was but a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in that Land, now presently
to bee giuen ouer into the hands
of strangers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> A stranger enioyes
the things of a strange place as a
stranger: hee vseth other mens
goods for a night, but hee setteth
not his heart on them, nor taketh
much delight in them, because he
knoweth hee must leaue them

away with him: Euen so a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
stranger taketh but a little
delight in his iourney, because he
thinks not himselfe at home, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he enioy things here as
his portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor as his own, because
he is to be countable for them:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14231:72"/>
and because he wel knoweth, that
too much delight in fleshly and
worldly pleasures giueth life to
corruption, &amp; weakneth grace in
him, he attendeth that wholsome
Apostolical exhortation, 1 <hi>Pet. 2.
11. Dearely beloued, as strangers

lusts, which fight against the soule.</hi>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Vsing the world.</note> a stranger vseth the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
comforts hee meeteth

vseth them rather for necessity
than for satiety, onely for present

and sobriety: Euen so a Christian
Pilgrim must learne to <hi>vse the
world as not vsing it:</hi>

and pleasures, to take his
mind off them, and to lift vp his
thoughts to heauen, the place of

strongly enforceth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.
Carnall men <hi>mind earthly things,</hi>

themselues in the pond &amp; puddle
of sensuality. But farre be it from
vs, who professe the teaching of
grace, so to doe; <hi>Our conuersation
is in heauen,</hi> from whence wee
looke for a Sauiour; they haue
<hi>their portion in this life,</hi>

portion is in another, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                  <p>Secondly, In that we are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
here, we learn another duty,
which is, the exercise of Christian
patience and contentment in all
estates, be it sicknesse, pouerty,
reproches, abuses or wrongs in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
kind: a stranger is contented
to endure the wrongs that meet
him in his way; he digesteth, and
putteth vp all patiently; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
not, and much lesse see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

shall haue little rest or redresse
till he come home: Euen so the
Christian <hi>Pilgrim</hi> must learne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently

to endure the afflictions,
and course and crosse vsages of

them by the same argument, That

and thin, through drops and drout
and all because he is going home.
Neither must thou that art a
Christian Pilgrim, shrinke for
the stormes of the world, nor the
asperousnesse of the way, which
is all strewed with crosses;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14231:74"/>
but hearten thy selfe as the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger,
who vsually saith, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
an ill day that hath a good
night; &amp; though many bitter pils
of harsh and strange vsages must
be swallowed by these strangers,
yet the consideration of home is
as sugar in their pockets to swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
them all.</p>
                  <p>A stranger measures not his
owne worth, nor thinketh worse
of himselfe for things befalling
him in the way; but esteemeth &amp;
valueth himselfe, according to
his estate at home: So must the
Christian stranger, liue by faith,
looke vpon things not seene. Let
the world vnder-value thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
thy selfe, that thou hast cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
&amp; reputation at home, where
thou art knowne, and thy worth
is known, which by no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the way can be obscured
or diminished.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a third duty hence, that
we are strangers here, is to learne
to estrange our selues from the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14231:74"/>
world, and courses of worldly
men. A stranger when euer hee
trauels, retaineth the manners,
fashions, and customes of his own
countrey; a Christian stranger al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be in the world, yet he
is not of the world, hee is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
corporation, and therefore
though he walke <hi>in the flesh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        </gap>.</note> yet
hee must not warre <hi>according to
the flesh.</hi> He carrieth this body of
flesh about him as others doe, but
he must fight against flesh and the
lusts of it, contrary to the Patrons
and defenders of the corruptions
that are in the world through lust.
The world may and must enioy
our presence for a time, but must
at no time gaine our conformity
to it, <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Fashion not your
selues according to this world;</hi> that
is, the customes and guizes of it;
because it lyeth in wickednesse,
and the Christian is cast into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forme of doctrine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation.
Art thou now sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to follow the lusts and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14231:75"/>
of this world? thinke with
thy selfe, that thou art a stranger
here, and of another countrey:
thou liuest vnder other lawes:
thou maist not cast in thy lot with
the wicked of the world, nor giue
voyce or suffrage in their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
but be as <hi>Lot,</hi> who though
he were in <hi>Sodom,</hi> was not of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
but was perpetually vexed
with the vncleane conuersation
of those wicked men. Art thou
prouoked to sweare, to drinke
excessiuely, to lye for aduantage,
to breake the Sabbath for gaine,
to vncleannesse, or any other
soule lust? Now say to thy selfe,
I am of the kingdome of light,
but this is a worke of darknesse;
this is an vnlawfull act in my
Countrey, and why should I pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
it here? seeing my Lord and
King must needs know it: if I
commit treason here against my
King and Countrey; my King
hath informers enow, and I
shall lose my whole estate there,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14231:75"/>
and bee banished out of my
Countrey for euer. Shall I,
(saith <hi>Joseph)</hi> commit this sinne
against my God, against my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster?
Seeing my Master hath
kept nothing from me but sinne,
I will not doe this thing, I will
not sinne, and commit this high
wickednesse.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A fourth duty is,
that seeing we are strangers here,
to learne to affect our own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and highly to esteeme it.
Euery man by nature loueth his
natiue country best, neither thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
himselfe so well in any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
land: and strangers, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
hauing parents, kindred, and
great reuenues in their natiue
soyle, and being hardly intreated
where they so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ourne, would be
glad to returne home, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
the sight of those whomu they
haue long longed to see: Euen so
the Christian Pilgrim. Neuer did
Israel more affect and extol their
owne countrey in their banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14231:76"/>
from it, and captiuity in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
than the Christian stranger
doth affectedly desire, and prefer
his heauenly Countrey aboue this
strange land, the Countrey of his
captiuity: For, he discerneth that
this is not his Country: first, That
is a mans Country where he was
borne &amp; brought vp; but whence
taketh a Christian his spirituall
birth, or where is he brought vp
but in the Church and kingdome
of Christ? Earth giueth him a
birth and being as he is man, but
as a Christian he is borne of God.
Secondly, againe, that is a man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
countrey where his parents, his
ancestors, &amp; deare kindred dwell
and inhabit. Now where dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
a Christian mans Father, but
in heauen? Where is his elder
brother but there? Where are all
his brethren and sisters, sons and
daughters of the same parents,
but there? and therefore heauen
is his Country. Thirdly, further,
that is a mans Countrey where
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14231:76"/>
his principall estate, and goods
are, where his patrimony and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
lyeth; and where is the
chiefe portion, the treasure, the
immortall inheri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
but in heauen? And where
else is his Countrey? Now then,
a Christian considering on the one
hand, that he is in a strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and how hardly he hath bin
intreated in it, and so likely to be
still; and on the other hand, that
he hath a home and a father there
that loueth him dearely; and that
his elder brother Iesus Christ, and
all his spiritual kindred, the Saints
of God are there: And besides
that, he hath a rich portion and a
large patrimony, euen an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
inheritance in heauen; how
can he choose but to be reared in
his affections, yea, rauished to be
there? desiring nothing in the
world more than to <hi>be dissolued</hi>
hence, &amp; to <hi>be with Christ, which
is best of all.</hi> A Traueller hath his
minde and thoughts still vpon
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14231:77"/>
home, and saith with himselfe,
Home is homely. And the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner,
or Sea-faring man in a
storme, or rough Sea, hath his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
on the Shore, and his minde
is not where his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ody is. So is it
with the Christian Passenger, his
minde is not where his body is:
and if he cannot get home in the
body as soone as he desireth, yet
in his spirit, he will mind heauen,
and heauenly things: he will get
as neere home as he can: if hee
cannot get into the heart of the
city, hee will be sure to get into
the sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

If hee cannot get suddenly into

will get into the <hi>Ierusalem which
is from aboue:</hi> and where his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
cannot bee for the time, his
conuersation and meditation shal
be <hi>in heauen;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 21.</note> for, <hi>where his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is, there will his heart be also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. In that wee are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<hi>with God,</hi> we learne diuers
things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:14231:77"/>
1. The soueraignty and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God, who is <hi>the great ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and ruler of the whole earth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 4. 14.</note>
Kings, themselues, who are the
highest earthly Lords, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
are but strangers with

<hi>we are but strangers</hi> and <hi>soiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. We must hence gather out
our owne duty towards God, in
whose Countrey we soiourne;
and our duty is manifold:</p>
                  <p>1. To aske leaue of God, to
passe through his Countrey; so
did <hi>Israel</hi> of <hi>Edom,</hi> a wicked
Prince and people, <hi>Numb. 20. I
pray thee that we may passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
thy country, &amp;c.</hi> It is fit to ask
leaue where no right is. Besides,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14231:78"/>
that by daily prayer for Gods
leaue, and fauourable loue in our
way, we both ascribe vnto God
the honour of soueraignty and
bounty; as also sweeten his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which he giueth vs leaue to
enioy,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 5</note> all which are <hi>sanctified to
vs by the word and by prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 Binde thy selfe from tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
in the way and Countrey
through which thou passest: So
did <hi>Israel</hi> vnto <hi>Edom, We will not
goe through the fields,</hi>

neitheir will we drinke of
the water of the wels: we will goe
by the Kings way, and neither turn
to the right hand, nor left, til we be
past thy borders.</hi> So must the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
be carefull he transgresse
not the lawes of the Countrey in
which he soiournes, to sturre vp
against himselfe the wrath and
reuenge of the Lord in whose

But the Lord of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

wisedome will be to resolue of
paines and trauell all the daies of
our life, and not to expect rest till
the night of death come, when
dying in the Lord we shall rest
from our labours: and because
<hi>this is not our rest,</hi> we <hi>must arise
and depart hence.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mica. 2: 20</note> And seeing we
can no more auoid this weary
iourney, than any of our Fathers
could do; we must rather bestow
wise and carefull thoughts, in
fitting our selues to our iourney,
and in behauing our selues

specially:</p>
                  <p>1. By casting off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:14231:80"/>
2. By prouiding for himselfe
things fit for his iourney.</p>
                  <p>Of the former sort there be
three especiall encumbrances
that the Christian Pilgrim must
lighten himselfe of. The first of
them is sinne, which as an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
burden <hi>presseth vs downe,</hi>
and <hi>hangeth fast on:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle counselleth <hi>to
cast it off,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 2.</note> if we meane to run the
race before vs. Now the way to
lighten our selues of this weight,
is to exercise eueryday the grace
of repentance and mortification,
and daily to take some sinne or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in hand, and at least to slake
and abate the power of it, that if
we cannot be rid of the sinne in
respect of the presence of it, yet
we may be rid of the reigne and
command of it.</p>
                  <p>The second, are earthly cares,
profits and pleasures, which are
as heauie stones tyed vnto vs, and
pressing vs from heauen to earth,
making heauie and sadde the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14231:81"/>
soule, and vnweldy in her moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The way for vs to lighten
our selues of these encumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
is daily and continually to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate,
&amp; raise our thoughts home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and heauenward, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
our selues in holy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
praiers, and praises, sundry
times through the day.</p>
                  <p>For as he that would keepe a
Clocke in true motion, must eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day sundry times windevp the
plummets, which are still draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
downward; euen so must we
doe with our hearts; the cares
and pleasures of the world are as
plummets of Lead, pressing down
the soule incessantly, in her moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards heauen; and he that
would continue his motion must
daily winde vp his heart towards
God: and by maine strength of
grace fetch it vp from earth, that
it may be firmly setled on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
things, delighting it selfe
with the riches of heauen, and
with contemplation of those
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14231:81"/>
pleasures, that are at the right
hand of God for euermore.</p>
                  <p>The third encumbrance, is the
feare of death, which presseth vs
all our life; and the Christian must
lighten himselfe of this burden
by looking beyond it to his owne
home; by longing after the liuing
God, whom none can see in the
body and liue; by considering that
the neerer he is to death, he is so
much neerer home: and what
stranger feareth to goe home; or
is sorry when after a long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
he is entring into his owne
Citie?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A wise Christian will
furnish and prouide himself with
necessaries, and needfull supplies,
to helpe him through his iournie.</p>
                  <p>There be fiue things especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which a traueller must fit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
withal, that his iourney may
be lesse tedious, and more pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
to himselfe.</p>
                  <p>1. The knowledge of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
way. Now whereas no man
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14231:82"/>
knowes the way to the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
countrey, without Gods tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
euery one must go to God
himselfe first, and then to such as
God hath appointed to be the
directors, and instructors in this
way. The former we see in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Dauid, Psalme 119. 19. I am
a stranger vpon earth, therefore
hide not thy Commandements
from me.</hi> He knew well how
hardly a blinde man could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
a farre and dangerous iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and thus it is onely th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
that shews the way
to this heauenly Countrie. Why?
was <hi>Dauid</hi> a blinde man, or did
he not know the ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements?
Euen <hi>Dauid</hi> who
was not stone blinde, but much
enlightned, was blinde in part,
and still earnest, that the LORD
would further <hi>open his eyes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ps. 119. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 35.</note> to
see the way more plainly and
clearely than yet he did: And
though he knew the words, and
true sence of the ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14231:82"/>
yet he desireth still to
be led further into the particular
vse, application, direction, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of them, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the Word,<note place="margin">Vers. 96.</note> which
he saith, is <hi>exceeding large.</hi> And
for the latter; As a stranger in an
vnknowne Country, and way, wil
euer be asking the way of euery
one neuer so simple, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the way better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
aud will obserue the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
markes, and statues, by
which he may know, whether
he be right or no: So must eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Christian Pilgrim be inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
of his way; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he must frequent the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of the word dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, which
God hath erected to be as <hi>A light
in a darke plabe;</hi> as the Pillar
of the Cloude and fire by night
and by day, to direct vs through
this dry and desart wildernesse;
as <hi>Ariadnes</hi> threede to helpe
vs through this troublesome
Maze and Labyrinth; and as a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14231:83"/>
                     <hi>voyce behinde vs,</hi> saying, <hi>This
is the way, walke in it.</hi> An inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue
Christian will be still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
with Gods Ministers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the way of God: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
with priuate Christians,
be they neuer so meane in place
or appearance, concerning their
great iourney betweene heauen
and earth; and will take speciall
notice of the markes of their
way, as whether it be the narrow
way, or the broad way; whether
it be strewed with crosses, or
pleasant to the flesh; whether it
be a cleane way, or a foule, dirty,
and miry way of lusts; whether
it be an old beaten way by the
feet of ancient beleeuers, the
Prophets, the Apostles, and holy
men, yea, of Iesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
or a new broken and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
way, vnknowne vnto them,
and the Scriptures; whether it be
a <hi>right way,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 14. 9.</note> or a crooked path of
by-lanes, &amp; turnings to the right
hand or to the left; whether it
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14231:83"/>
be a lightsome, or a <hi>darke</hi> way,
and the like.<note place="margin">Pro. 4. 19.</note> Thus inquisitîue and
carefull will a Christian Pilgrim
be of the best directions he can
get; as the poore iaylor will know
of <hi>Paul</hi> his prisoner, what he
may doe to be saued; and it is
none of the lightest plagues of
God, to haue an heart vnwilling
to aske about the way of heauen.</p>
                  <p>A second comfortable helpe
in an vnknowne way, is a good
guide. The Christian stranger
hath need of a guide, and the
best guide is God himselfe, yea,
and more, God is the onely
guide. In any other way or iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
the natiues or inhabitants
can guide a stranger from place
to place, but here none but God
can be our guide, <hi>Psalm. 25. 9.
He will guide in Judgement, and
teach the humble his way.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But how then may a
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>an get God to be his guide?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> By two speciall
meanes:<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:14231:84"/>
1. <hi>By earnest Prayer:</hi> Dauid
<hi>knowing that none but GOD
could guide him, prayeth,</hi> Psal.
143. 8. Shew mee the way that I
shall goe. <hi>And</hi> verse 10. Let thy
good Spirit lead me vnto the land
of righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>2. By constant subiection to
Gods word; for GOD goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs by his word, as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Israel</hi> in the Pillar of the
Cloud and fire, and willing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Gods word, maketh
God our guide.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A stranger in his way
needeth his viance, or prouision
for his expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The word of God
is the Christians <hi>viaticum,</hi> and
supplieth all his needs, it offoords
him food in his hunger, being the
bread of life, and the Mannah that
came down from heauen; it yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
him drink in his thirst, being
water of life, &amp; whosoeuer thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
is called to thes sweet waters
of consolation, drawne out of the
wells of saluation; it affoords him
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14231:84"/>
Physicke in his soules sicknesse;
strength in his weakenesse, and
neuer leaueth him that learneth
vpon it, without sufficient means
to helpe him through his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a traueller hath need
of a weapon to defend himselfe,
and to wound or keepe off his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
The same word of God is
a speciall part of our spirituall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
it is the sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
And as <hi>Dauid</hi> said of <hi>Goliahs</hi>
sword, Oh, there is none to that,
giue me that; so there is no sword
to this for the repulse of all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
enemies, and for the sure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of him that shall buckle it
close vnto him. Besides that, it
directs him to obtaine and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
vnto him all the other pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Cstristian armour, so as in
no part he lye open or naked to
danger.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, A Treueller hath
need of good company, which
is <hi>pro vehiculo,</hi> as good as a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14231:85"/>
Waggon or Coach, to carry
him with the more ease through
the tediousnesse of the way. The
same testimonies of God are
sweet companions, and helpe
to deceiue, and pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ouer our
time comfortably; if wee can
<hi>talke of them in the way,</hi> and in
the house, and in the field; and
if we can whet them vpon our
selues and others, if wee make
them <hi>The man of our counsell,</hi>
and meditate on them night and
day: hee is neuer alone that
hath God and Christ conferring,
counselling, and directing him
in the Scriptures: neither is hee
alone, who when hee is most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
is in Soliloquie with God:
this man wanteth neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
nor comfort.</p>
                  <p>Now how happily shall this
man compasse his iourney, and
goe <hi>singing</hi> through the most
tedious wayes of his <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ps. 119. 14.</note>

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4. In that we are Pilgrims

                     </hi> Wel
did the holy men consider, what
an aduantage it is to set out in the
way of God early, euen in the
morning of the life: What a
sweet comfort it is to be early
graced; that we haue but a short
day passed away in a few houres
to trauell in; that this day
stayeth not, but hasteneth
from vs; that this day is the
onely time to walke in; and that
this day being shut in, there is
no more time to worke or
walke in, and therefore did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirre
themselues lest they should
fall short of their intended iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                  <p>2. As a man in his iourney,
will be glad of any good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that will goe but part of his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14231:86"/>
way with him: So must the
Christian in his iourney, be glad
of company in his way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;
and heartily embrace the
fellowship and society of the
Saints, which meane to goe
through with him. Indeed if a
man would choose to sort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with euill men, he might
get more company, but they goe
the contrary way; but a wise
traueller will rather chuse to goe
with one, or two, yea or alone in
his right way, than goe a cleane
contrary way for company. Let
vs be glad to meet our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men
in this through-fare,
be kinde to them for the same
Countrey sake; and as we shall
easily know them by their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,

so let vs heartily affect them,
and vndiuidedly cleaue vnto

oppressions of the Saints of God
in these heauie times of warres
and bloudie persecutions; in
which the Captaines of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
chase the godly from their
seates, houses, estates, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
not suffering the Doue of
Christ a rest for the sole of her
foot. Here is a ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</p>
                  <p>1. That all the furie of the
enemies, exiling and banishing
the godly, can but make them
<hi>strangers,</hi> and so were they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
wheresoeuer they dwelt
in any place of the earth. It is
no great addition of misery to
banish him, that was in banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before; or to driue a man
out of one strange place into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
He that is already a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
vpon earth in affection, can
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14231:89"/>
easily become actually a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
if God call him vnto
it.</p>
                  <p>2. When the enemies haue
exercised all their rage, they
cannot banish them out of
GODS Countrey; but they
are <hi>strangers before GOD,</hi> who
is equally present with them in
one corner of the earth as well
as in another, to protect them, to
prouide for them, to pittie them,
and guide them home to their
owne Countrey.</p>
                  <p>3. Although the enemies
would be endlesse in their rage
against the Saints: and were
they to liue euer, they would
euer nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ish and exercise an
immorttall wrath against the
people of God, yet can they
not inflict so much mischiefe on
them as they desire: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that themselues are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
and besides the justice of
God breaking quickly to pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the roddes of his wrath,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14231:89"/>
and casting them into the fire:
the godly themselues are but
strangers here, and of short
continuance: so as, suppose
their sufferings be sharpe, yet
they be but short. The roddes
of the wicked shall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
lye vpon the lot of the
righteous (as they desire they
should) seeing the godly are
strangers as well in time as in
place, and themselues not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing,
their misery cannot be
continuall.</p>

a Christian hath comfort,
that he being a stranger here,
he hath no great estate to loose:
some Moueables, such as he

way, but his estate and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance

who nousled and mis-led this
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14231:93"/>
Orphan in Popery, till shee
came about foureteene yeeres
of age; at which time this
Lady died. Upon which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
God (hauing a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
purpose towards her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion)
by his good Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
brought her to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of that Religious and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Countesse of <hi>Leicester,</hi> who
entertained her with more
than ordinary respect, both
because of her young yeares,
as also because shee was allied
to Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> then
husband to the honourable
Countesse; at whose request
his Lady had taken her into
her care.</p>
                  <p>To this Honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse
shee came a most zealous
Papist, and resolute, as soone
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14231:93"/>
as possibly shee could appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
a fit opportunity, to
conuey her selfe beyond the

for she then thought that that
was the surest and likeliest
way to get Heauen:<note place="margin">This reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious care of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Countesse as she did all her life thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, so it is very obseruable both for the high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of her honor and for the imitation of others of her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ranke.</note> which
as shee had an earnest desire to
attaine, so would shee take the
nearest way which shee
thought would bring her thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But shee could not so
closely carry her secret deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and intentions, but that
by the carefull eye of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Lady, they were
soone discouered, and not soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
discouered then wisely
preuented; for presently her
Lady tooke from her all her
Popish bookes, Beades and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
and all such trumpery,
and set a narrow watch ouer
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14231:94"/>
her, that shee might bee kept
from her Popish Prayers,
and not absent her selfe from
the daily Prayers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
which were religiously
obserued: further, requiring
her to reade those Prayers
that her honour daily vsed to
have in her private chamber
with her women.</p>
                  <p>Her Ladiship also careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preuented her from her Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
company and counsel by
word or writing, for neither
might shee write nor receive
any letter without the view
and consent of her Honour.</p>
                  <p>Shee also constrained her to
be countable for the Sermons
which shee heard in the house,
which were constantly two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Sabbath day, (for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the sound knowledge
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14231:94"/>
of God, which is the onely
Hammer of Popery.) And
hereby shee in short time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
great ability to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to others the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of those Sermons which
shee heard, the rather because
it was constantly obserued
by all the women in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Family, to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
after the last Sermon,
and make repetition of both.</p>
                  <p>And this shee did as yet for
feare, but still with this reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
that shee would keepe
her heart for Popery; and
trusted that God would bee
merciful vnto her (as <hi>Naaman)</hi>
in this which shee did onely
through feare and constraint.
But God (who in his owne
time worketh in his owne
meanes) beganne to worke in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14231:95"/>
her first a staggering in her
old way; For, when she saw
the holy conuersation of that
Reverend Preacher, Master
<hi>I. W.</hi> who was then Chaplin
to the Countesse, shee began
to perswade her selfe, that sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this mans godlinesse must
needs bring him to Heaven.
And then the reverend respect
of the man made her begin to
give some better eare to his
Doctrine, to examine his
proofes, and to reverence his
Ministry; whereby in short
time, it pleased God that shee
was won to beleeve the Truth,<note place="margin">Her new birth.</note>
and renounce her former su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and ignorance. And
as it is the property of a true
Convert, being converted her
selfe,<note place="margin">Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of others, and was a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14231:95"/>
great helpe and furtherance to
the publique Ministery that
way: For this was a thing
which that honourable Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
tooke speciall knowledge
of; and there were many that
had great cause to blesse God
for her in that respect.</p>
                  <p>Now presently Satan (that

to rage,<note place="margin">Reu. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with strong and violent temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:<note place="margin">Her long &amp; strong temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
and first hee terrified
her in that shee had sinned the
sinne against the holy Ghost,
for shee had played the deepe
dissembler; and being in heart
a Papist, yet joyned with the
Protestants whom shee held
for Heretickes, and all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14231:96"/>
conscience, and so fiercely and
incessantly hee followed this
temptation, as that shee was
perswaded it was impossible
that euer this sinne should or
could be pardoned. And this
temptation was pointed and
sharpened with that dreadfull
and foule suggestion of selfe
murder, as if the remedy of
the sin against the holy Ghost,
were to destroy ones selfe.
While shee was thus long tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
&amp; tumbled in these waues
and billowes of Satanicall
suggestions, wherein she was
so low cast and dejected (still
concealing her griefe) as shee
almost despaired of recovery;
It pleased God to direct that
Reverend Preacher (who was
her Father in Christ, &amp; whom
shee ever after embraced with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14231:96"/>
the most entire love of the
most naturall Childe) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of this sinne, and to shew
what it was, and by whom and
in what manner it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
To which Doctrine
shee diligently harkening, and
by examination of it, and her
selfe, finding that shee had not
so sinned after illumination,
nor with obstinate malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God or his Truth,
(which when shee was most
superstitiously devoted, shee
desired to finde out) it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God to quiet her mind for
that; and so led her ouer that
temptation.</p>
                  <p>But Satan that departed
from our head, Jesus Christ,
onely for a seaon, was not
long away from the molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this his member, but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14231:97"/>
returned and brought seuen
worse spirits (were it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
than before, and now his
name may be <hi>Legion;</hi> for now
hee would confound and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
her with multitudes of
blasphemous thoughts, and
doubts. Now must shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
there is no God: That
the Scriptures are not his
Word, but a Pollicie: or if it
were his Word, who must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it? or how could shee
a silly woman get the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of such deepe myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as are contained in the
same? Besides, as shee was of
mind that she was gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of
one error, so she knew nothing
but that shee was mis-led into
another; for, how could shee
be sure that this was the truth
which she now professed, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14231:97"/>
there are as many, or more
learned men of the one opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as of the other, and all of
them maintaine their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by the Scriptures. Thus
was shee vexed and exercised
with Armies of roving and
unsetled conceits for five or
six yeares together, till God,
(whom shee often sollicited
for direction and assistance in
the combat) brought her to
this resolution, that she would
hold these conclusions, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
disputes Satan might
weary her withall: That there
was not onely a God in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but a God that was her
God: and whatsoever opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
there were in the world,
that there was but one Truth,
and that was to bee learned
out of the Scriptures; and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14231:98"/>
though there were much in
the Bible which shee did not
understand, yet shee was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that if shee would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
read and search the
Scriptures, with earnest pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to God for a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in them, shee should
attaine thence a measure of
knowledge, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fficient to bring
her to heaven; and holding
strongly these grounds, shee
found the temptations waste
away by degrees, and her selfe
daily more strongly setled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the foundation.</p>
                  <p>Neither was shee onely by
the grace of God a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in these temptations, but
I may say with the Apostle, in
a manner more than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
by them; for, God
(who bringeth light out of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14231:98"/>
darkenesse) made these temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
a sweet seasoning of
her whole life. By occasion of
which, shee tyed her selfe to a

observed for the space of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeares together, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her taske upon her birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and reading every day so
many Chapters as to bring it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14231:99"/>
about iust with the yeare. By
which exercise shee gained a
great increase of knowledge,
and no lesse strengthening of
her faith; for she did not read
carelesly or negligently, but
alwayes kept a note of what
places she did not vnderstand,
and would still bee inquiring
the meaning of them, as shee
met either with Ministers, or
such as she thought were able
to informe her in the same.
And her custome was euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shee opened her Bible, to
send vp a short prayer vnto
God, for the opening of her
blinde eyes, to the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of those sacred myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that so they might bee as
a Lanthorne to guide her feet
in the wayes of holinesse, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
shee had attained her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14231:99"/>
happinesse.</p>
                  <p>And not herewith conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as a good <hi>Mary,</hi> she pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Word of God in
her heart; for by her great
industry in the Scriptures, shee
had gotten by heart many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Chapters, and speciall
<hi>Psalmes;</hi> and of euery Booke
of the Scripture one choyce
verse: all which shee weekly
repeated in an order which
shee propounded to her selfe:
and being asked why shee was
so laborious in getting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
those Scriptures in
memory? Her answer was,
that shee knew not what daies
of triall or persecution might
come, wherein shee might be
depriued of her Bible, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good bookes and helpes;
but so much of the Scriptures
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14231:100"/>
as she could get into her heart
shee knew no Tyrants or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
could bereaue or rob her
of. (God make thee that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
and me that writeth this,
so Christianly prouident, as
in these dayes of plenty to lay
vp somewhat for the dayes of
straitnesse and famine.) Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in her priuat Prayers.</note>
from that time of her
trouble shee resolued vpon
<hi>Daniels</hi> practice, wherein shee
was also constant; namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the family duties, which
were twice a day performed
by the Chaplin in that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
house in which shee liued
till within one yeere of her
death; And besides the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
Prayers that shee daily
read in her Ladies Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
shee was thrice every
day on her knees before God
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14231:100"/>
in secret, like a true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
whose delight was to bee
in Gods presence. By meanes
of which daily exercise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all other comfortable
fruits, shee attained a singular
sweet gift in prayer, whereby
she could both strongly wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
and happily prevaile with
God, whose grace suffereth
himselfe to be ouercome with
the prayers of his weake ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p>And because she knew that
Religious fasting is the whet-stone
of Prayer, shee tyed her
selfe to set apart six dayes in
every yeare, wherein shee was
extraordinarily humbled in
fasting and prayer, for her
owne sinnes, and the sinnes of
the times. At all which times
shee was in speciall manner
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14231:101"/>
earnest with the Lord, that he
would bee pleased further to
reveale vnto her his whole
Truth, needfull for her salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and keepe her constant in
the obedience thereof vnto
the end.</p>
                  <p>And because shee knew
that the right and worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
of the Sacraments af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth
a Christian speciall
strength, and much stabilitie
in the course of godlinesse: as
shee diligently apprehended
that comfort when shee could
conueniently receiue that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
so for many yeares
shee had laid a band vpon her
selfe, neuer to receiue it, but
the day before to fit, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
her selfe seriously, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humbling her selfe before
the Lord in fasting and prayer
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14231:101"/>
all the day long.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> the trouble of her
conscience, made her ever of
a tender conscience: fearefull
shee was of offending God
and her owne conscience; and
watched her selfe narrowly;
and to keepe her selfe in awe;
for the space of fiue yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her death, shee kept a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of her daily slips, and
set downe euen the naughty
thoughts which shee obserued
in her selfe, that one day in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
weeke shee might extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
humble her selfe
for all the failings of that
weeke, and this with such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
abstinence as might best
fit her weake body to humble
and feruent prayer. And all
these priuate Religious duties,
she performed so secretly, that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14231:102"/>
none but her bosome friend
knew of their performance.
As shee was thus fearefull of
sinnes present, and to come, so
her conscience was tender in
respect of sinnes past, as may
appeare by this memorable
instance; Whilest shee was a
childe bred vp in the chamber
of that old Lady, shee was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
by lewd servants who
fed her with figges, and other
such toyes, fit to please chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
withall, to steale money
out of the Ladies Cabinet
which often stood open in her
Chamber, and which they
knew shee had the fittest op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to doe of all other:
whereunto her childishnesse
giving way, shee found it not
missed, and so continued it for
seven yeares or thereabouts,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14231:102"/>
without any great checke of
Conscience. But when the
light of God came in, and
made a priuy search in the
heart; and made her able to
take her selfe with the fact;
now shee was ashamed and
confounded in her selfe, and
her stirred conscience gaue her
no rest, nor could shee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
any hope of quiet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
shee saw shee had done
that which shee could no way
vndoe. If shee looked at the
summe of mony taken and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
away, she conceiued that
by continuing in that course
seuen yeares together, shee
might haue wronged that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
thirty or forty pound. If she
thought of restitution, she was
no way able. Thus shee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the burthen of this sinne
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14231:103"/>
a long time, easing it as wel as
she could with a resolute pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
if ever God pleased to
make her able, to make resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
to the heires of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Lady. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so she did. For when that
honourable, and bountifull
Lady, whom shee long ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
gave her a large portion
when shee bestowed her in
marriage, she forthwith made
choyce of a Reverend Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
whom shee employed
therein (enjoyning him secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie)
and because shee would
be sure to make full restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
shee delivered him sixty
pounds, to tender vnto this
Ladies heire, as from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
servant of the Ladies,
who had vniustly taken it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from her. And when the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14231:103"/>
Gentleman returned tenne
pounds of it againe, such was
the tendernesse of her consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that she would receive
none of it to her owne vse; but
gave it away to poore and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
persons and vses. And
this childish errour, God tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to her good; for in all the
two and twenty yeares of her
service unto that honourable
Lady, she never durst make
vse of any thing that was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her charge, were it small
or great, but set it downe in
writing, and once every yeare
did make it good, either in the
kinde, or in some other thing
which she bought for her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diships
vse.</p>

                        </gap>ion</note> the sense of her
owne weaknesses and wants
made her of a pittifull and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14231:104"/>
charitable disposition towards
the wants and miseries of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Shee had ever a large
heart to the poore, especially
the godly poore; shee neuer
did see or heare of any that
were in want, but her heart
did mourne if shee had not to
releeve them, neither was her
hand shut, for she did yearely
lay aside a portion of money
to the vttermost of her ability
(if not beyond) for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe.
Thus she lived holily,
happily, and desiredly: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could so gracious a life be
shut vp but by an answerable,
that is, an happy death and
dissolution, whereof I will
adde but a few words, and so
leaue her to her happinesse til
we meet happily againe.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that the life of a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14231:104"/>
Christian should be a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
meditation of death,<note place="margin">Her lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> as it
is a continuall motion to
death: and such was the latter
part especially of the life of
this Christian woman, who
was of weake and sickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
many yeares before
her death, which made her so
much the more prepared for
her last combat and sicknesse,
which lasted ten weekes; in
all which time she certainely
apprehended and expected
her dissolution, it being the
principall, and almost onely
subject of her discourse, sixe
moneths before it came. But
thirty dayes before her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
she finding her paines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
and growing very
sharpe and tedious, shee spent
an houres talke with me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14231:105"/>
her desire for the
things of this life; and hauing
said what she purposed, shee
thus concluded her speech:
Now, sweet Heart, no more
words betweene you and me
of any worldly thing, onely
let me earnestly request, and
charge you, that as you see
my weaknesse increase, you
will not faile to assist me, and
call on me to follow the Lord
with prayer and patience; For,
now I know, that Satan will
shew all his malice, because
his time is but short against
me, and hee will easily espy
my weaknesse, and make his
aduantage of it, and therefore
now especially help me with
your counsell, comfort, and
prayers.</p>
                  <p>In all the time of her sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14231:105"/>
our gracious God who
as a fast friend standeth closest
to his servants, when they
haue most need of him, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his gracious presence with
her, as in all other comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
supplies answerable to
that depth of distresse, so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in hearing and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her prayers, and desires
of her heart.</p>
                  <p>There were foure requests
which we observed shee espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
preferred vnto God in
her sicknesse,<note place="margin">Foure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>specially she made to God in her sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and heard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> them all.</note> and in none of
them was denied.</p>
                  <p>The first, that she might be
armed with strength against
Satans assaults, which she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
would bee fierce and
frequent; from whom shee
was mercifully freed; for
onely three dayes before her
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14231:106"/>
death, she began to be deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the sense of her
owne dulnesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
began to call in question
Gods love towards her, and
the truth of Gods grace in
her; for said shee, were I
the Lords, why should not
I lift vp my head now, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the time of my dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
draweth on so neare?
But these complaints conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
not above six houres,
but she had much cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and comfort againe,
which she expressed, both in
earnest and excellent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
(wherein her gift was
more then ordinary for her
sexe) as also in many cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thankes and prayses to
God for his great mercy, for
that he had now so chained
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14231:106"/>
Satan at this time of her great
weaknesse, that having beene
formerly molested, and daily
vexed with his assaults, for
the space of above six yeares
together, now he would not
suffer him to rest on her with
his malice above six houres.</p>
                  <p>Her second request was,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
that the Lord would streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
her with patience to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
all her paines to the
end; and herein she was as
graciously heard as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
for although she was
full of paines, and assaulted
with many strong fits, in which
no part was exempt from
deadly paynes, and every of
these fits of many houres con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
yet was she never
heard to vtter any word of
impatience in her selfe, or
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14231:107"/>
discontent to any that were
about her, and much lesse to
charge God foolishly, in
whose hands she was as the
clay in the hand of the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Her third request to God,
was, that she might in all her
sorrowes be still supported
with some sense of his love;
and with the assurance of the
pardon of all her sinnes. And
that God was comfortably
found of her in this request,
was very apparant in her joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
expectation of death;
the time whereof she truly
foretold five dayes before it
came; and as this time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
her joy increased;
so as she was able to comfort
her mournfull husband and
friends, saying; Mourne not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14231:107"/>
for me, but for your selues, for
I shall very shortly be more
happy than the wishes of your
hearts can make me, and
therefore cease your mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and helpe me thither
by your prayers as fast as you
can.</p>
                  <p>Her fourth request was,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
that she might have her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
continued unto the last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that so by no idle, or light
speech, she might dishonour
God, or bring scandall o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> her
profession; for she said, If I
through paine or want of
sleepe (which she much wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
should haue any foolish
or idletalke, I know what the
speech of the world vseth to
be; This is the end of all your

not themselues, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:14231:108"/>
And as she prayed, God
gaue her her memory to the
last gaspe,<note place="margin">Her happy departure</note> that she dyed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for a little before her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
she called vs that
were about her, and hasted
to Prayer, for now (said she)
I shall be gone presently:
(which words we then belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

ended, she said with more
strength than she had spoken
any thing foure houres before,
<hi>Amen, amen.</hi> Into thy hands,
O Lord, I commend my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Lord Jesus haue mercy on
me, and receiue my soule. And
thus with her last breath and
words, her soule was carried
into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome in the
Heavens, to which her eyes
and hands were lifted. This
was the life and death of this
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14231:108"/>
sweet Saint, as it was observed
and now faithfully witnessed
by her mournfull husband,
who wisheth both his life and

particular directions for euery

we may not thinke it a defectiue

rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s, to all which wee must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
euery particular action of
common life, for the allowance
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14231:113"/>
or refusall of it. And therefore
for the help of such as are teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
I thought it might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to apply vnto those gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and bring to their triall, this
particular of habits, and attires;
vnto which, while they are squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
none haue so much right to
vse them as women fearing
God: but if they depart from
those rules, they are not so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely
in any, as in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The generall Rules are
these, reduced to foure
heads.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Some concerne God:
2. Some our selues: 3. Some
our brethren: 4. Some the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
it selfe. For vnto all
these wee must haue respect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in our Attires and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>I. In respect of God, we must
attend three rules:</p>
                     <p>1. The first concerneth our
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14231:114"/>
warrant, and is this: No orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must be vsed, but by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and leaue from God. Our
warrant is from the Word; our
loaue is by prayer: the rule for
both is expresse, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 5. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
creature of God is good, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by the word of God and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
Whence it followeth, that
whatsoeuer ornament, attire, or
fashion, is not warranted to the
heart by some part of the Word,
the ground of faith, or for which
it cannot send vp a prayer of
faith for Gods blessing vpon it:
that cannot be warrantable to a
godly heart. Which of our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
in their strange fashions,
ponder that of the Apostle, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
ye doe in word or deed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 3. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>doe all
in the name of Christ:</hi> that is,</p>
                     <p>1. By the warrant of his
Word.</p>
                     <p>2. With inuocation of God in
the name of Christ.</p>
                     <p>2. The second rule concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
God must looke to the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14231:114"/>
right end, namely,</p>
                     <p>No ornament or attire of any
fashion or colour may bee vsed
till the heart be assured that this
be the proper end, That in ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the body, it honour God.
1 <hi>Cor. 10. 31. Whether yee eat or
drinke, or whatsoeuer ye doe, doe all
to the glory of God.</hi> The word
<hi>whatsoeuer,</hi> being a word of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersality,
fetcheth in the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
action of life, in which we
are bound chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fly and principally
to intend, and set vp the glory of
God, for which end hee created
not our selues onely, but all his
workes, first to himselfe, and
then for vs. Whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that whatsoeuer fashion, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
or ornament doth spot or
staine the glory of God, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
of God, or our holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
that is vnwarrantable
and vnlawfull.</p>
                     <p>3. The third rule concerning
God, is, That</p>
                     <p>No ornament may be vsed to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14231:115"/>
correct Gods workemanship,
which euen a skilfull Artificer
would take il at any mans hands.
It is true, a woman may nourish
her haire, for it is her glory; and
may seemely adorne her selfe
with her owne, for so was the
Church in Christs eyes; yea, and
in want of their owne, if for
seemelinesse they borrow of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others,<note place="margin">Cant. 4. 3.</note>
it may be excused (so
modesty be not exceeded:) but
of very wantonnesse or pride
to dislike their owne, or to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
such ornament of strange
haire as their naturall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
haire will not reach vnto, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
vanity and discontentment
with the worke of God, saying
vnto God, Why hast thou made
me thus, or why hast thou made
my haire of this colour, and not
of that?</p>
                     <p>And much more to grow out
of liking with Gods workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
on their faces, and by pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to refine them to their own
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:14231:115"/>
fancies, is an immodest sinne
condemned in whorish <hi>Iezabel.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Kin. 9. 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note>
We deny not but it is lawfull
to couer a blemish, or hide an
hurt or deformity in seemly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
but by defacing Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,
and by stamping pride
on their faces by painting and
colours, can by no colour be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted.
Say not, It is custome;
for all custome must bee ruled by
the word of Christ, who said, <hi>I
am Truth;</hi> and not, <hi>I am Custome.</hi>
Nor say, I must bee handsome
and comely, and therefore I may;
for this is but to couer pride vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this pretence. Neither say,
I am young, and may take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 4. 6.</note>
for young men and women
must be sober as well as other.
Nor say, I must please my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
True; but it must bee in
the Lord, and in things honest
and lawfull. Or can it please any
husband, to come before him in
a visard, a borrowed and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
face and fashion?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:14231:116"/>
II. The second sort of rules
respecting our selues, are fiue.</p>
                     <p>1. No ornament or attire may
be worne, till the heart be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that it will bee fitting and
pleasing to the holy Ghost, whose
Temple the body of euery belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
is. 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 19. Know yee not
that your bodies are the Temples of
the holy Ghost?</hi> Now because this
holy Spirit cannot take pleasure
in any ornament but such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
holinesse, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
can any other beseeme this
Temple; therefore all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
will make conscience of
what they offer to adorne this
Temple withall, and be sure it be
no light, strange, odde, or swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
fashion or attire, taken
from light and wanton persons,
that they present the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God with, for the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of his temple.</p>
                     <p>And besides, seeing euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer
hath put on Christ as a
garment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13, 14. it will be
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:14231:116"/>
the wisedome of euery Christian
to see that his ornament be suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his apparell, that neither
his ornament shame his suit, nor
his suit disgrace his ornament.
Euery thing in a Christian, from
a Christian, on a Christian, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, should sauour of
Christ, and expresse him. Be sure
that thy ornament suit with the
same minde that was in Iesus
Christ.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 5.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. No Ornament may be vsed
with affection, or affectation.
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. the Apostle forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
broydred haire: and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 9. he forbiddeth not that only,
but gold, and pearles, and costly
apparell. Which wee must not
vnderstand as if hee simply and
absolutely did forbid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the wearing of gold, or
chaines, rings, bracelets, billi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s,
spangles, and the like: but
the thing forbidden, is the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
and study of these things.</p>
                     <p>When women (for to those
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:14231:117"/>
he writeth in both places, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more impotently carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with this vanity than the
other sexe) not onely take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in outward ornament, but
study brauerie, and striue to be as
braue, or beyond others, at least
not behinde them in vaine and
new-come fashions, which is a
signe of a sluggish and delicate
minde, giuen vp to the delights
of the flesh, and farre from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.</p>
                     <p>Our Lord, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 28. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
not Christians to bestow
their thoughts on apparel which
is more needfull than ornament.
And his Apostle commands vs
to vse the most necessary things
as not vsing them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31.
Then must wee restraine our
selues euen in lawfull liberties,
when wee finde our selues prone
to bee brought vnder the power
of any of them, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
                     <p>3. No ornament or habit may
be worne against shamefastnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14231:117"/>
and modesty. 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 9.
The women must array themselues
in comely apparell, with shamefast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and modesty.</hi> We know, that
since the fall, nakednesse is a
shamefull thing, and sinne hath
cast shame on euery part, and
calleth for a couer ouer al but for
necessity; and garments were
ordained to hide nakednesse, not
to display or discouer it. And
me thinks it cannot stand either
with religion, or modesty, or
with the shamefastnesse of that
sex, so to attire themselues, as to
display their naked breasts, and
some somewhat lower; or bare
their armes beyond that which
is fit for euery one to behold. I
cannot enter into the heart to
iudge any: but I much feare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are, or haue euer beene
deiected with a deepe sense of
their soules nakednesse, and
therewith ashamed and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
before God, that are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to vncouer their bodily
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:14231:118"/>
nakednesse (beyond that which
is comely) before men.</p>
                     <p>4. No ornament or attire may
be vsed to the impeachment of
our good name, which is <hi>better
than the most precious oyntment,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccel. 7. 3.</note> or
ornament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if it carry a brand
of pride, wantonnesse, lightnesse,
or inconstancy, or a note to bee
an inuenter or follower of new
and strange fashions: whereas
the Apostle would haue the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
habit and attire expresse
the <hi>feare of God</hi> which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. and would
haue women to bewray the <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
man of the heart</hi> in all their
outward attires, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. that
is, the new creature, and diuine
nature, which is hid and seated
within, but shewed forth in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
behauiour, and sober car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
But alas, how doe they
prouide for their reputation, that
(as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> complaineth of
some women in his time) so
lightly and wantonly tire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:14231:118"/>
that when they come into
the Church or Oratory, they
seeme rather to come into dance
than to pray. And the euill is
greater, that the hurt falleth not
onely on their owne names, but
on the name of God also.</p>
                     <p>5. No ornament or attire may
bee vsed to the wasting of our
outward estate, or the abuse of
Gods blessing in riot or prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
or the disabling vs from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
helpfull to others. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because wee sit not in our
owne, but are stewards of these
things, and must bee countable
how we expend them. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heart must bee sure therefore
to lay out nothing for attires, or
fashions, but that which it may
comfortably bring in accounts
vnto God.</p>
                     <p>Besides, the word of God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
necessary iniunctions vpon
vs to doe good, and distribute to
the necessities of the Saints; to
be rich in good workes, thereby
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:14231:119"/>
both to testifie the truth of our
faith, as also to be furthering our
owne reckoning. Now what an
vnanswerable ouersight were it,
by excesse and superfluity in
things (comparatiuely) vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
to disable our selues for so
necessary duties, and preuent our
selues of so large and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
retribution,</p>
                     <p>III. Now follow the rules
concerning our brethren.</p>
                     <p>1, No ornament or fashion
may be vsed to offend our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
brother. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 21. It is
not good to doe any thing (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it more necessary than at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires)
with offending the weake
brother. If the heart suspect or
discerne, that this or that attire
may or doe offend any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
if the iust cause of the offence
rise not out of the thing which
may be allowable enough, but
out of his weaknesse that takes
the offence, the precept of the
Apostle bindeth it, to tender the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:14231:119"/>
weaknesse of his brother, and
now to forbeare his or her law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
libertie; and vpon very good
and grounded reason. 1. Because
charitie is better than outward
ornament. 2. The nourishing of
our brothers faith, is farre more
precious than the nourishing of
out owne flesh. 3. The edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our brother is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before our owne pleasure.
So, as a conscience well informed
will bee very tender to offend a
weake brother by vndue and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
vse of his liberty, although
himselfe bee perswaded well of
it.</p>
                     <p>2. No ornament, atire, habit,
or fashion, may bee vsed to the
strengthning of any vaine minds
in their new-fangled and strange
guizes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. And <hi>fashion
not your selues to this world.</hi> A
godly minde may not like, or be
like vaine-minded persons i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
their fashions, forme, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
no not so much as <hi>enter into
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14231:120"/>
their way, Prou.</hi> 4. 17. nor bee
companions with them in any
of their works of darknesse, <hi>Eph.
5.</hi> 7. Now as it will bee a sorry
plea for thyselfe in thine account
to say, I thought I might doe
this or that, because I saw some
before me whom I thought well
of; so will it iustly increase thy
iudgement, that thou hast by thy
practise strengthned the hand of
sinners, and harde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed them in
their sinne, whom by thy sober
and seemely carriage thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
haue actually and really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Yea, and in that rule of
the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 26. Lot all
things be done to edification,</hi> thou
art cast as guiltie, who hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
him by thy example,
whom thou shouldest haue edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                     <p>3. No ornament or attire may
be vsed, which may become ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a share to our selues or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
There are some habits fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to draw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yes, to get louers,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:14231:120"/>
and to occasion vnlawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
The daughters of <hi>Sarah</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
such whorish habits, and are
carefull that by nothing about
them any eye or heart may bee
entangled. Their endeuour is
not to auoyd onely apparent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
but <hi>appearances of euill.</hi> To
discouer by our habits some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
parts,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5.</note> as many doe, is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of temptation to many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.
And as in the Law, hee
that digged a pit and left it vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
must answer for the oxe,
or asse, or beast that fell into it:
so here; although they are beasts
that fall into the pit of lust vpon
such spectacles, yet are they not
free, that couered not the pit.

But I intend no such thing by my
habit; for if thou knowest it may
bee an occasion of mouing euill
lusts, and doest not preuent the
occasion, thou art blame-worthy
as the first in that sinne. Thou
hast filled a cup of poyson to the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14231:121"/>
beholder, although there be none
to drinke it, saith <hi>Chrysostome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IV. Now followes the last
ranke of rules, concerning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
or attires themselues.</p>
                     <p>1. No outward ornameut or
habit may be vsed vpon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
which is seuered from the
inward ornament of grace vpon
the soule. The Apostles no
where mention this argument,
but they commend this to the
chiefe care of Christian women,
to bee more sollicitous and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in adorning the soule with
grace, than the body with gay
clothing: and plainly teach that
the true ornament of a Christian
woman,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 3.</note> is her sanctification,<note place="margin">Prou. 1. 9.</note>
which beautifieth the hidden
man before God. This is the
ornament for her head, and
chaynes for her necke. This is
the borders of gold, and studs of
siluer, which make her comely
in the eye of Christ, <hi>Cant. 1. 10,
11.</hi> Yea, this is her grace among
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14231:121"/>
men, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. 25. And when <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
shall proue deceitfull,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vers. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>aad
beauty to be vanity,</hi> then shal a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
fearing the Lord, be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
All ornaments of nature,
all artificiall colours and couers
are but filthinesse, where this
is wanting. See <hi>Prou.</hi> 11. 12. A
iewell of gold in a swines snout,
is a beautifull woman without
inward comelinesse. Seuer this
from outward ornament; and
though shee may please her selfe
a time in her conceit of brauery;
I shall assure her, shee shall haue
no reioycing in heart, no hope
in death, no ioy in God, no bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in iudgement. Take the
counsell of Christ in time, <hi>Reu. 3.
18. I counsel thee to buy of me white
garments,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. No ornament or attire
must be worne against the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and example of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
frugall, and graue persons of
our owne ranke. <hi>Phil.</hi> 49, Wee
must thinke and doe whatsoeuer

things pertaine to <hi>good report,</hi> and
whatsoeuer things haue any <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
or praise in them.</hi> Now to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the most modest, sober, and
vertuous of our ranke, is vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and prayse-worthy, and of
good report: whereas to inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of euill fashions, or imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of light, wanton, garish, or
proud persons, in their proud or
fantasticall fashions, brings a
iust blot vpon the person, and a

                        </gap> easily bee
healed. And how iust is it, that
such as will pride themselues,
and glory in themselues, against
the glory of Iesus Christ, and the
Gospell of Christ which they
professe, should meet with shame
and contempt amongst men of
sound iudgement, and be sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with a little contemptuous
flattery onely of such wantons as
themselues?</p>
                     <p>3. No ornament must be vsed
which is not as well expedient
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14231:122"/>
as lawfull. 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 23. All
things</hi> (meaning things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent)
<hi>are lawfull for mee, but all
things are not expedient.</hi> Euen such
things as are lawfull, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expedient
for a meane estate and
condition, whether it bee in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
or in ability.</p>
                     <p>What an inconuenient excesse
is it, to weare gold for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when they want siluer for
necessaries: now to weare iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
for pride, and then pawne
them for need; to rufflle it in
silkes, when they can scarce pay
for cloth; to make an idle shew
and ostentation of abundance,
when indeed they are in great
wants? Is it fit for such to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
fashions? No, but as we must
eat according to that with which
the Lord hath blessed vs; so must
we also in our attire and habits.

signifie?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> An inward action of the soule,

when by the faith of our soules

his flesh, and bone of his bone, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as the bread and wine become

must not onely be duly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
but applied also according to
their significations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yea, and this must hold the
mind intent through the whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of receiuing the Sacrament,
in vniting of the signes &amp; actions,
with the things signified by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> How may we doe this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In all the actions of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I must conceiue the actions of
God mentioned before; and in my
owne actions receiuing, I must
conceiue the inward actions of my
owne faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> This indeed seemes most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in the act of receiuing, and
therefore explaine it first in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Minister.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. When I see the Minister
take the Bread and Wine, I
must conceiue an action of God,
taking &amp; setting apart his Son from
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14231:129"/>
the masse of mankinde, to be the
Redeemer &amp; Sauior of the world,
and my selfe in particular.</p>
                  <p>2. When I heare him blesse the
Bread and Wine, I must conceiue
God the Father sanctifying his Son
with all gifts and graces, aboue all
men and Angels, needfull for the
greet worke of redemption of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and of my selfe in speciall the
chiefest of them.</p>
                  <p>3. When I see him breake the
bread and powre out the wine, I
must conceiue that action of God,
breaking his Sonne to peeces, with
the infinite weight of wrath and
curse due to my sinnes as well as
any others.</p>
                  <p>4. When I see him distribute
these signes; I must conceiue that
action of God, offering Christ and
saluation to euery one, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of faith and repentance; and
exhibiting and giuing him to the
saith of my owne heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> And what must you conceiue
in the actions of beleeuing?</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. In taking of the bread and
wine, I must conceiue the hand of
my faith now reaching out it selfe
to apprehend Christ and all his
benefits to my selfe in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                  <p>2. In my eating and drinking,
I must striue to feele the power of
my vnion with Christ, strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and renewing my soule with
new life of grace, &amp; power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
as the food doth, applied to
an healthfull body.</p>

whether he haue receiued increase
of grace, and strength against sin,
and whether he haue added any
thing to his repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance &amp; obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>

and suspect his vnprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednes,

the more. 3. Frequent the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
