         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince my laſt, we ſeeing the Enemy not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to engage, and yet very apt to take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
againſt ſpeeches of that kind, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in our Army, which occaſioned ſome
of them to come to parley with our Officers
to let them know that they would fight us, they lying
ſtill in, or neer their faſtneſſe, on the Weſt ſide of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
We reſolved (the Lord aſſiſting) to draw neer to
them once more, to try if we could fight them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
one houres advantage gained, might probably (we
think) have given us an opportunity, to which purpoſe,
upon Tueſday the 27 inſtant, we marched Weſtward of
<hi>Edenburgh</hi> towards <hi>Sterling,</hi> which the Enemy perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
marched with as great expedition as was poſſible to
prevent us, and the Vantguards of both the Armies
came to skirmiſh upon a place, where Bogges and paſſes
made the acceſſe of each Army to the other difficult. We
being ignorant of the place drew up, hoping to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
but found no way feazeable by reaſon of the bogs
and other difficulties.</p>
            <p>We drew up our Cannon, and did that day diſcharge
two or three hundred great ſhot upon them, a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
number they likewiſe returned to us, and this was
all that paſſed from each to other, wherein we had neere
twenty killed and wounded, but not one Commiſſioned
Officer, the Enemy as we are informed had about four-ſcore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46625:3"/>
kild and ſome conſiderable Officers. Seeing they
would keep their ground, from which we could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
them, and our bread being ſpent, we were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated
to go for a new ſupply, and ſo marched off about
ten or eleven a clock on Wedneſday morning. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
perceiving it, and as we conceive, fearing we might
interpoſe between them and <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> though it was
not our intention, albeit it ſeemed ſo by our march, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
back again with all haſte, having a Bogge and
paſſes between them and us. There being no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
action, ſaving the skirmiſhing of the Van of our
Horſe with theirs, neere to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> without any loſſe
to either part conſiderable, ſaving that we got two or
three of their Horſes.</p>
            <p>That night we quartered within a mile of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi>
and of the Enemy. It was a moſt tempeſtuous night and
wet morning, the Enemy marched in the night between
<hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to interpoſe between us and our
Victuall, they knowing that it was ſpent (but the Lord
in mercy prevented it) which we perceiving in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
got time enough, through the goodneſſe of the
Lord, to the Sea ſide to revictuall; the Enemy being
drawn up upon the Hill neer <hi>Arthurs</hi> Seat, looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, but not attempting any thing. And thus you have
an account of the preſent Occurrences.</p>

            <p>SInce my laſt, we have againe twice attempted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the <hi>Scots</hi> Army. Upon Tueſday laſt, we march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an endeavour to interpoſe betwixt <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:46625:3"/>
and <hi>Sterling,</hi> and by that neceſſitate the Enemy to
fight, and accordingly wee advanced, with our whole
Army, but they being in view of us, (only a river part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
diſcerned by our march what we deſigned, and ſo
haſtened their march, untill they came to a Paſſe neare
us; and drew up in Ba<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>talia, we did the like, all being
confident we ſhould within a quarter of an houre have an
ingagement, and as we judged could not be prevented,
the ground appearing equally good on both ſides. The
Word given out was <hi>[RISE LORD]</hi> the body of Foote
advancing within leſſe then twice Musket ſhot, and then
was diſcovered ſuch a Bog on both our wings of Horſe
that it was impoſſible to paſſe over. Thus by this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unexpected hand of Providence were we prevented,
and only had liberty to play with our Cannon that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and part of the next morning which did good execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as wee beleive, upon them, we had very ſtrange
and remarkeable deliverances from theirs, though they
played very hard upon us, and that with much art,
but the Lord ſuffered them not to do us much hurt, we
had not ſlaine and wounded above five and twenty men.
We finding it not poſſible to ingage them, and far from
our Proviſions, divers of our men having caſt away their
Bisket, with their Tents out of a conſidence they ſhould
then fight: We therefore reſolved upon our march back
to the Sea side, The Enemy likewiſe haſtened towards
<hi>Edenburgh,</hi> we did beleeve their deſign was to gain a Paſſe
or two, and ſo interpoſe betwixt us and our Proviſions,
which they might eaſily have done being before us, but
the Lord gave them not courage to do it, we found them
drawne up near <hi>Edenburgh</hi> by <hi>Arthurs hill,</hi> and not at

               </gap>he Paſſe. They inſtead of offering to advance upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46625:4"/>
us, retreated behind one of their Gariſons, and ſo march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on that ſide of the Paſſe, wee came over up towards
thoſe hills we left.</p>
            <p>So we finding an impoſſibility in our forcing them to
fight, the Paſſes being ſo many and great, that as ſoone
as we get on one ſide, they go over on the other, that
the Councel yeſterday was very unanimous on this, that
it was to no purpoſe further to march after them, but
inclined generally to fall upon Gariſoning of <hi>Dunbarre,</hi>
and other conſiderable places nearer <hi>Tweed,</hi> and after one
Gariſon compleated (if we have no better complyance)
proceed to ſome more ſevere courſe then hath bin yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
I know many among you will thinke it ſtrange we
have done no more againſt them: I wiſh they may eye
the Lord, and not man. We have this ſatisfaction, there
is no meanes left unattempted by us: We have done our
utmoſt, and the Lord therein gives us comfort, beſides
many remarkeable teſtimonies of his preſence.</p>
            <p>Of late we have underſtood thoſe who have the name
of honeſty among them, begin to be better ſatisfied, and
more deſirous of an Agreement. They are not ſo of a
peece as they were, but their diſaffection about the King,
and other diviſions increaſe: They ſee themſelves in a
ſnare, and would gladly many of them get out, we are
aſſured their honeſt men will not long hold in with
them. The Lord I doubt not but one way or other will
very eminently appear with us, is the prayer of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate

            </opener>
            <p>HAving taken <hi>Redhall</hi> Monday the 26 inſtant, wee
advanced from <hi>Penckland</hi> hills, about two miles
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46625:4"/>
to the water of <hi>Leith,</hi> and the next day we marched on,
reſolving (if poſſible) to ingage the Enemy, who were
drawne up that morning in Battalia, as if they intended
to have ſtood us; but as they obſerved us wheeling to
the Weſtward, to come upon them, they remooved
from their ground, and gained a paſſe, where there was
a boggy ground of each ſide. Our men were drawn on
with all poſſible ſpeed, not knowing the ground to bee
ſuch, and were in a ſhort time ſet in order. Never more
reſolution and willingneſſe knowne to have engaged an
Enemy then was in our men at that time; but when we
ſhould have fallen on, neither wing was able to come at
them, and then we perceived that, notwithſtanding all
their bravadoes the day before by Sir <hi>Jo. Browne,</hi> by
whom they ſent us word they were reſolved to give us a
faire meeting; Yet their haſte towards us was not to
engage us, but to ſtop us from comming at them. Wee
ſtood in Battalia that afternoone, and next morning:
the Cannons playing hotly on both ſides, and though
we were much the fairer mark, ſtanding upon the pitch
of a riſing ground, yet it pleaſed God our loſſe was
much the leſſe, we had onely about foure that dyed upon
the place, and about 18. or 19. wounded; and of the
Enemy about 100. wounded and killed, one Col. <hi>Mennes</hi>
and a Captain, and a Lieutenant of Horſe, and an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
killed of theirs. We have loſt ſince our comming
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Enemy, onely one Commiſſion Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
<hi>viz.</hi> Col. <hi>Lilburnes</hi> Cornet, who was killed at the
charge at <hi>Muſcleborough.</hi> There was ſeverall ſtrange
ſhot, one was at Major <hi>Hobſons</hi> Troopes, which was
drawne cloſe together to prayer, and juſt as the <hi>Amen</hi>
was ſaid, there came in a great ſhot among them, and
touched neither Horſe nor man. The next morning hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46625:5"/>
but two daies proviſion left, and ſeeing we could not
in that place engage them, we drew back to our old quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
on <hi>Penckland hills,</hi> and the Enemy drew between <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi>
and <hi>Leith,</hi> as if they would that night have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
our Gariſons on the Eaſt ſide of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and
have interpoſed between us and our bread &amp; cheeſe. The
29 inſtant we marched to the Eaſtward of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and
ſeeing the Enemy drawn up from <hi>Arthurs</hi> Hill to the Sea
ſide, we poſſeſſed our ſelves of the next ground to them,
within Canon ſhot, reſolving there to have endevoured
to engage them, but they very gallantly drew away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Arthurs</hi> Hill and <hi>Cragmiller</hi> a Gariſon of theirs.
Our Canons ſome of them reaching them, and doing as
