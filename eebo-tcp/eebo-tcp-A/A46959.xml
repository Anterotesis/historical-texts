            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>READER,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Collection of Miracles was intended as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to the School of the Eucharist, and to let the <hi>Hereticks</hi> know further, that if the <hi>Papists</hi> please they can trump up Miracles to prove all their other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as well as that single one of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nay, they have out-done their own Business in that kind, for they have employed Miracles against one another, to prove the contrary Points of Doctrine which are amongst themselves: So that the World has not only been filled with <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> but, for instance, with <hi>Dominican</hi> and <hi>Franciscan</hi> Miracles. For to pass by the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of <hi>Jetzer</hi> which is of elder date, it is well known how the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets Eggs in the <hi>Canaries</hi> have been of late years both Maculists and Immaculists, and have been found in quite contrary Stories. For when the <hi>Franciscans</hi> were baffled in their other Arguments, they betook themselves to this last and most unanswerable Method of Confuting their Adversaries, and accordingly one of them brings an Egg to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> which was well attested to be found in a Pullet's Nest, with an Inscription of Letters which seemed to grow in the Shell of it, <hi>That the</hi> Virgin Mary <hi>was Conceived without Original Sin.</hi> This Miracle stunnied the <hi>Dominicans</hi> for some time; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways set a Priest to catch a Priest, for by that time the <hi>Dominicans</hi> were Virtuoso's sufficient to prepare one, They also had a Pullet's Egg out of the Nest with the quite contrary Inscription upon it: And if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop had not put a st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uth of this Story is so well known to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ubstance of it I will refer my self to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Walk upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and I am sure I have not willingly varied in any Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66175:3"/>But will any man of common Sense call such Forgeries, as all these are, by the Sacred Name of Miracles? Or entitle the little Cheats of Priests to the Almighty Power of God? No surely; for not only every Christian has a surer Word of Prophecy to give heed unto, but also every Natural Man has a better Light to guide him, than to be imposed upon by Lying Wonders. For as for Christians, it is a first Principle with them, That if an Angel from Heaven teach any other Gospel than what they have receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d from Christ and his Apostles, that Angel is a false and accursed Spirit, and not to be believed; And with mere Natural Men it is an undoubted Axiom, That God cannot deny himself, nor work any Miracle which is Inconsistent with his own Divine Nature: So that if any pretended Miracles to attest such Doctrines as are contrary to the plain and express revelation of Scripture, and to the unchangeable Nature of God, we are able at the first sight, both as Men and Christians, to pronounce such Miracles to be false and counterfeit. Upon both of these accounts we are sure that the School of the Eucharist is an heap of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries, which are not fit to be endured either by Men or Christians. For the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, in behalf of which God is said to have wrought all those amazing Miracles, is expresly contrary to Scripture, which teaches us, That Christ's Body is a true Humane Body, in Humane Shape and Proportions: Whereas Transubstantiation quite contrary makes no more but a little Breaden Apparition of the self same Body, and will force us to believe, That it is in the form of a Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mb of Bread. Again, all Miracles wrought in behalf of Transubstantiation, are wrought to Prove, That both the sides of an infinite number of Contradictions are True; But as we are men we are infallibly certain, that it is Impossible for both sides of a Contradiction to be True: From whence we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like certain, That it is Impossible for the God of Truth to set his Seal to Transubstantiation, that is to say, to such a number of Falshoods.</p>
            <p>The same may be shown in the other Points of Popery, as Invocation of Saints and Angels, Worship of Images, Worship of Relicks, or Dead Mens Bones, Prayers in an Unknown Tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are downright Contradictions both to the Doctrine of Scripture, as also to the Principles of Natural Light, and the everlasting Notions which we have of God. But because <hi>Purgatory</hi> is the matter which lies before us, I shall chuse rather to instance in that.</p>

               </note>And <hi>1.</hi> The Popish Doctrine which says, <hi>That amongst the Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacles or Apartments of Hell, there is a Purgatory-fire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Souls of the Godly being tormented for a limited time are cleansed from Sin, that so they may have a passage into their Eternal Country into which no unclean thing shalll enter,</hi> is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

another Gospel; for I challenge all the World to shew me where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour or his Apostles have Prea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hed any such Gospel: Nay, it is a contrary Gospel, for it stands in a direct and diametrical opposition to the principal Doctrines of Christianity, as has been largely and learnedly shewn by Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> in <hi>The Second Part of</hi> his <hi>Preservative against Popery.</hi> So that if the Papists had fourty times more Miracles than they have for the establishment of Purgatory, yet while we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians we must reject both it and them as Forgeries and Falshoods.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> As we are men we are able to shew the falshood of that Doctrine, and consequently of all the Miracles wrought in behalf of it. For let men call an old Heathenish Poetical Fiction by the Name of an Article of the Catholick Faith, the new Name does not alter the nature of the Thing, nor make a Fiction to be a Truth.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore examine Purgatory as a Doctrine of the Poets, but by no means as a Doctrine of Christianity, and consider what a wise Heathen would have said to it. And <hi>1.</hi> He would say, That to suppose the Souls of the Godly to be an unclean Thing, is a contradiction in terms; for an unclean Soul is an ungodly Soul. <hi>2.</hi> He would say, That Fire is no means of purging away the Defilements of a Soul, nor can a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual substance be chymically prepared for Heaven. <hi>3.</hi> He would make work with their contradictious Charity in Praying for Souls out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, in giving Alms and saying Masses to help them out, when yet they stedfastly believe with a Divine Faith, that those Souls were sent thither on purpose for their good, and that if the punishments of Purgatory be not necessary for their entrance into Heaven, they went thither in vain. <hi>4.</hi> Though he were a very Philosopher, he would smile as much, to think how one man's Alms or Ave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s should supply the place of a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rging Fire and refine another man's dross, as he would to think how one man's taking Physick should make another man Well. In short, he would think of this Doctrine, and of all the Miracles which support it, as he ought to think.</p>
            <p>This is a sure way of judging concerning all other Popish Miracles, even of the great <hi>Xavier</hi>'s, which the Author of the Pulpit Sayings, <hi>p. 21.</hi> brags to have gained credit amongst Protestants themselves. But for certain those Protestants had never read <hi>Xavier</hi>'s <hi>Persic Gospel,</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as I remember by <hi>Ludovicus de Dieu,</hi> for then they must have concluded, that God would never give his Letters of Credence to such a false Apostle, nor employ his own Almighty Power to gain belief to such an heap of Falshoods as there is, yea though they be mixed with some Truths, for the Devil himself never spoke all Lies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66175:4"/>It is easie to apply this Rule, which can never fail, to all the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in this following Collection, which are such as cannot be reconciled with Christianity, nor the natural Notions which we have of God. <hi>God and Nature do nothing in vain</hi>; But can any thing be more vain and sportive than those Matches of Mira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>les, which we have <hi>p. 32 and 44</hi>? Where Omnipotency is employed to less purpose, than the Capping of Verses betwixt two School-boys, or than if one of them should stand to blow out a Candle, while the other blew it in again. And if those Miracles which passed betwixt St. <hi>Molva</hi> and St. <hi>Modoc,</hi> p. <hi>44.</hi> have any meaning at all, they tend only to confirm the Doctrine of Abstaining from Meats; which Doctrine has but a very bad Character, <hi>1 Tim. 4. 3.</hi> and therefore those Miracles are undoubted Impostures. For the Doctrines of Devils shall never be confirmed with God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Miracles.</p>
            <p>But every Reader is able to judge for himself, which of these Miracles are to n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> purpose, and which are for the Priest's purpose, and to make the Popish Pot boyl, as the Fire of Purgatory plainly is; which are for the honour of the Saint, and the dishonour of God; which are fit to enslave men's minds, and which are fit to widen their Belief, that they may the more easily swallow the Mysteries of Popery; and in a word, which of them serve best for those Superstitious and Antichristian Uses, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> knows very well how to put them to. And therefore I shall only take notice of one single Miracle, but it was a Breeder and had a great many more in the belly of it, and that is the Staff of <hi>Jesus,</hi> which <hi>Justus</hi> the Hermite was ordered to deliver to St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> of which you have an Account <hi>p. 42, 43.</hi> Now I only ask, Whether the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians said their Creed that Morning, when Iesus Christ had lain all Night at <hi>Justus</hi>'s Cell, and when he delivered to him the Staff? For at that time either the Article of his sitting in Heaven, or else his delivering of the Staff, and ascending afterwards into Heaven, was not true. And I desire some Romish Priest to tell me which it was.</p>

               <head>The History of a Man, that having experienc'd the Pains of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, chose much rather to suffer the Miseries of Humane Life, for many Years together, than Three Days Torments in Purgatory.</head>
               <p>WE read in St. <hi>Antonin,</hi> that a Man who had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely debauch'd, was visited by God with a long and painful Sickness. As he was a great lover of his Pleasure, and his Distemper putting him as it were upon the rack, he at length lost all Patience, and earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought our Lord, that he would send Death to him. An Angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him, that offered him the choice, either to continue sick as he was two Years longer, or spend three Days in Purgatory. This Man being only sensible of his present pain, preferr'd three Days in Purgatory, before a two Years sickness. But hardly had he been an Hour in those Dreadful Flames, but that the same Angel came to visit him there, and askt him in what condition he found himself. Ah! he answer'd, you have deceiv'd me: For I was to have been but three Days in Purgatory, and whereas I have now been several Years here. No, the Angel retorted, I have not deceived you. But it is the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of your pains, that makes you think the little time you have been here so long. Ah! for God's sake, reply'd he, do so as that I may again return into life; For I am ready to suffer all the pains of my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, not only during two Years, but as long as it shall please God to afflict and punish me. He obtain'd what he required, and never after did he complain of the pains he endured. <hi>Le Pedag. Christien,</hi> p. 508.</p>

               <p>A Holy Man, call'd <hi>Bertrand,</hi> a Provincial of the Order of St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minique,</hi> said Mass daily for the expiation of his own sins, without troubling himself with offering it to God for the repose of Souls in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.

The Night following a dead man appeared ten times to him, knocking his hand against his Coffin, and making a shew as if he would maul him.

               <p>ST. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> saith the Reverend Father <hi>Ribadeneyra,</hi> in his <hi>Flowers of the Lives of Saints,</hi> was wont to demand three things of Almighty God with great Instance: The first was force to serve him without ever relenting in that first Primitive fervour wherewith he had undertaken his service. The second, that he would be pleased to keep him always in the humble and poor condition of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous state, which he had made profession of. And the third was, that he would reveal unto him, what state his Brother <hi>Arnold</hi> was in, whom the Emperour <hi>Conrade</hi> had put to death, because he stuck to the Party of the Church. All which three things our Lord granted him in ample manner. For he gave him Grace to persevere in his service until death in his Religious Order, with great sanctity; and he revealed unto him in a Vision, that his Brother was in the state of Salvation; our Lord recompencing the Death which he was put unto for his Service and for the Defence of the Church. His Sister, that had taken a Religious Course, appeared once unto him, whilst he was praying, and told him, that she was in Purgatory, demanding the Assistance of his Sacrifices and other Prayers. The Saint was very careful to help her with Masses, Fastings, Prayers,

Romanus</hi> bid him, <hi>go on and persevere in the state he was in, for it was very good, and God was well pleased with it.</hi> Then <hi>St. Thomas</hi> asked <hi>Romanus, how all things went with him, and where he was?</hi> To whom he replied, <hi>that he was now in Heaven; but had been fifteen days in Purgatory for a neglect which he had committed in the Execution of the Bishop of</hi> Paris <hi>his Will, in a Matter which ought to have been performed out of hand, and was delayed by his fault.</hi> Some other things did <hi>St. Thomas</hi> ask him, and was satisfi'd in them all, after which <hi>Romanus</hi> vanished, leaving him in great comfort and consolation.

The man that sold him this Land had now been dead three years: And his Heirs, for to please the King, who bore a great enmity to the Saint, and to make their benefit of so fair an occasion, complained of the Bishop in a Juridical Court, that he had seized upon an Inheritance that belonged to them. The Business was brought to be examined before the King; who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Bishop wanted some necessary Writings, and that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, for fear of his displeasure, durst not inform the Court of the Truth, condemned him to restore the Lands to <hi>Peter</hi>'s Heirs, as due and proper to them by right of Inheritance. The Saint demanded three days for to bring <hi>Peter</hi> before them, of whom he had bought the Land, and who, as we said, had been dead and buried three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66175:7"/>
They easily granted him his demand, making a jest and sport of it. But the Saint fasted, watcht and pray'd with great fervour and instancy, begging of our Lord, <hi>That seeing the Cause was his, and that it was he who was wronged and injured by that unjust Sentance, he would be pleased to take the whole Business in hand, and rise up in his own defence.</hi> At the end of three days, having offered up the Holy Sacrifice of Mass, he went unto the Grave where <hi>Peter</hi> lay buried, and made the Grave-stone be taken away, and the Earth opened until the Body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: Then touching the said Body with his Grosier-staff, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Peter</hi> to rise. At which instant the dead Body obeying the Voice of the living Saint, <hi>Peter</hi> rose up and followed him to the Court, where the King was, accompanied with all his Nobles and Judges To whom <hi>St. Stanislaus</hi> spoke thus: <hi>Look here is</hi> Peter, <hi>of whom I bought the Land; who having been dead, is risen again, and now standeth before you. Ask of him if it be true that I paid him entirely that for which he sold and I bought that Land for the Church. The man is sufficiently known, his Grave is open: It is God who raised him to life, for the confirmation and assured proof of this Verity. His Word ought to be a more certain and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Argument of it, than all the Testimony of Witnesses, or Evidence of Writings that can be alledged.</hi> This so great and manifest a Miracle did extreamly daunt the Courage of the Bishop's Adversaries, and struck them to the very heart, so that they remained quite dumb, and had not one word to say: For <hi>Peter</hi> declared publickly the Truth, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gravely and seriously warned his Heirs <hi>to do Penance for this their sin, and for having so much molested the holy Prelate, contrary to all Equity and Iustice.</hi> St. <hi>Stanislaus</hi> offered <hi>Peter,</hi> if he desired to remain some years in Life, to obtain it for him of Almighty God. But he chose rather to return to his Grave, and die again presently, than to abide in so troublesome and dangerous a Life: and told the Saint, <hi>That he was in Purgatory, and that yet he had something to suffer in satisfaction for the remnant of his sins: and that he had rather be secure of his salvation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were by undergoing the rest of the pain and torment due to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sins, than engage himself in the hazard and jeopardy, by embarking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new to be tossed in the stormy and tempestuous Sea of this wicked World. That he begged of him to beseech our Lord to remit and pardon him the rest of his Punishment, and to release him soon out of that Prison, and bring him to enjoy his glory in the blessed company of Saints.</hi> When he had said this, St. <hi>Stanislaus</hi> accompanied him to the Grave, and a multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple went along with them. <hi>Peter</hi> laid himself down in his Tomb, and composed himself for his last Rest; and begging of all the Assembly for to recommend his Soul unto our Lord, died the second time, for to go to live eternally with Almighty God.</p>

The Religious man returned into <hi>France,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated that which he had heard of the holy Hermite with <hi>Odilo</hi> Abbot, and with all that blessed Congregation which was under his charge: And the Abbot ordained that in all his Monasteries, upon the second of <hi>November,</hi> the day after the Festivity of <hi>All Saints,</hi> should be made a particular Commemoration of the Dead, and that especial care should be used to succour and relieve them, by Prayers, Alms, and Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And that which <hi>St. Odilo</hi> instituted in his Convents, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards received and established by Apostolical Authority in the whole Universal Church. <hi>Peter Galefinus</hi> Protonotary Apostolical, says, that many write, that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> XVI. instituted this Commemoration by the counsel and advice of <hi>St. Odilo.</hi> It is true, that <hi>Almarius Fortunatus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Trevers,</hi> who lived about 200 years before <hi>Odilo,</hi> in a Book of the Ecclesiastical Offices, which he wrote to <hi>Ludovicus Pius</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, after the Office of the Saints, he puts that of the Dead; and he says that he did so, because many depart out of this Life, who do not go presently to Heaven, for whom that Office was wont to be said: which is a sign that even in his time this was done, as Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> has noted. And this is sufficient to declare the Institution of this Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the Dead, and the occasion of making of it.</p>

One day amongst the rest, as he was cooling his Gouty Toe, he heard a Voice from out of the Ice, whereupon he conjures it to tell, who or what it was. The Voice answers, <hi>I am a Soul afflicted for my sins in this Ice, and unless you say thirty Masses for me, thirty whole days together; I shall not be delivered.

When the Hurly-burly was past, he falls to his Bus'ness the second time, but with as ill success; for then there arose a Civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion in the Town. The third time he means to make all sure: but see, (as the Devil would have it) the whole City, with the Bishop's Palace, was all on a light fire; his Servants were importunate with him, to cast away his Book, and to provide for his own safety. Do what they could, they could not prevail. All the Answer they could get is this, that though the Town should be burnt to the ground, he is resolved not to give over, till he had made an end. To be short, he was as good as his word. Would you hear the issue? He had no sooner finished, but the Ice melted, the Soul was delivered, and the Fire va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; neither was there any damage at all received.

A Brother of his, a good Priest and Abbot, with diligence making search for his Body, amongst many happened on one that was exceeding like him, (as a man may easily be deceived in the alteration that streight falleth upon the Soul's departure, to the whole form and fashion of the Body) and bestowed of his Love, the duty of Obsequies, with solemn Memorials for the rest of him, whom he took to be his Brother decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: burying him in his own Monastery, and causing Mass to be done daily for his pardon, and Soul's release. But so it fortuned, that his Brother <hi>Huma,</hi> (for so was he caulled) being not all-out dead, within four and twenty Hours came reasonably to himself again: and gathering withal some strength, rose up, washt himself, and made means to come to some friend or acquaintance, where he might salve his Sores, and close his Woundes again: But by lacke of strengthe to make shifte, and by misfortune, he fel into his Enemies handes: and therby the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine examined of his Estate, he denied himself to be of Name or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie in his Coontry. Yet by the lykelyhoods that they gathered of his coomly demeanure, and Gentleman-lyke taulke, which he could hardly dissemble, they mistruste (as it was indeede) that he was a Man of Arms, and more than a Commen Souldear. Therfore in hope of good gaine by his raunson, they thought good after he was full recovered, for fear of his escape to lay Irons upon him, and so to make sure-work. But so God wrought, that no fetters could howld him: For every day once at a certaine houre, the bandes bracke lowse without force, and the man made free. The Gentleman marvailed at the case himself, but his

                  <hi>ELdred,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Rievall,</hi> gives this following Account; That in the time when King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> by the Preaching of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Christian Faith: his Nephew <hi>Sigebert,</hi> who governed <hi>East Angles</hi> (rather <hi>East Saxon,</hi>) by the same holy Bishop's Ministry received the Faith. This Prince built one Church within the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> the principal City of the Kingdom; where he honourably placed <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus</hi> Bishop of the same City without the Walls: Likewise towards the West he founded a Famous Monastery to the honour of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and endowed it with many Possessions. Now on the Night before the Day design'd for the Dedication of this Church, the blessed Apostle St. <hi>Peter</hi> appear'd to a certain Fisher-man in the habit of a Stranger, on the other side of the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> which flowed by this Monastery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be waft over, which was done: Being out of the Boat, he entered into the Church in the sight of the Fisher-men; and presently a heavenly Light shone so clear, that it turned the Night into Day. There was with the Apostle a multitude of Heavenly Citizens, coming out, and going into the Church: A Divine Melody sounded, and an Odour of an unexpressible fragrancy was shed abroad. As soon as all things pertaining to the Dedication of the Church was performed, the glorious Fisher of Men returned to the poor Fisher-man, who was so a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>I have thought expedient,</hi> saith he, <hi>to describe here out of the Acts of St.</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus <hi>a wonderful Miracle beseeming an Apostolick Man, which is omitted by St.</hi> Beda. <hi>It was thus: The Holy Man being arrived to the Shore of the</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish <hi>Sea, and ready to take Ship, celebrated the Divine Mysteries, offering to God the Sacrifice of the Saving Host as a</hi> Viaticum <hi>for himself and Followers, After which, the Season being proper, he was hastily urged to enter the Ship: and the Wind serving them, they sailed speedily, when on the sudden</hi> Birinus <hi>called to mind that he had lost a thing infinitely precious to him, which by the urging hast of the Seamen, having his mind other ways busied, he had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him at Land. For Pope</hi> Honorius <hi>had bestowed on him a Pall, or Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, upon which he consecrated the Body of our Lord, and afterward used to wear it in a Particle of the said Sacred Body, which he hung about his Neck, and always carried with him: but when he celebrated Mass, he was wont to lay it by him upon the Altar. Armed therefore with Faith, he by Divine Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration went down from the Ship into the Sea, and walk'd securely upon it to the Shore. Where finding what he had left behind, he took it, and in like manner returned to the Ship, which he found standing still immoveable, whereas a little before he had left it sailing extreme swiftly. When he was entred into the Ship, not one drop of water appeared on his Cloaths; which the Mariners seeing, kneel'd before him, and worshipped him as a God: and many of them by his Preaching were converted to the Faith of Christ.</hi>

               <p>St. <hi>Edmund,</hi> King of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> having had his Army under the Command of the valiant Count <hi>Walketule</hi> routed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> in the time of their Invasion of this Island, that Pious King was likewise, after some farther Opposition, taken by them; and being tied to a Tree by order of their General, was first most cruelly whipped, and then those Barbarians did, as it were in sport, so pierce with their Darts his whole Body in all places, that in a short time there was not left place for a new Wound; yet he willingly sustaining all these Torments for the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and Defence of his Countrey, they cut off his Head.</p>
               <p>But the Rage and Malicious Fury of those <hi>Pagans</hi> not ceasing after they had thus slain King <hi>Edmund</hi>; but casting out his Body despightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they kept the Head to revenge themselves yet further on the Tongue which had so constantly sounded forth the Name of <hi>Christ:</hi> and after they had used all manner of Contemptuous Scorns upon it, they cast it into a secret place in a thicket of a Wood adjoining, lest the <hi>Christians</hi> should venerate it, and decently bury it with the Body.</p>

out of their lurking Places, they reverently took his Body out of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Place where it had been cast, and then with all diligence sought for the Head. And whilst every one of them with equal Affection search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each corner of the Wood, there hapned a Wonder not heard of in any Age before. For whilst they dispers'd themselves in all parts, and each one demanded of his Companions, where it was that the <hi>Danes</hi> had cast the Head, the same <hi>Head</hi> answered them aloud in their own Tongue, <hi>Here, here, here:</hi> neither did it cease to cry out in the same Words till it had brought them to the Place. And to add to the Wonder, there they found a mighty and fierce Wolf, which with its Fore-feet held the Head, as if appointed to watch and defend it from other Beasts. When they were come, the Wolf quietly resigned it to them: so with joyful Hymns to God they carried and joyn'd it to the Body, the Wolf in the mean time following it to the Place where they buried it; after which, the Beast returned into the Wood: In all which time, neither did the Wolf hurt any one, neither did any one shew the least Intention to hurt the Wolf. <hi>F.

Immediately the whole Army of them took wing; but being sensible of the injury done them, they flew not away, but hovering over the Holy Virgins head, with wonderful noise, made complaint of their loss. She hearing their importunate Clamours, understood, by Inspiration, the cause thereof; and, after search made, the Offender confessed his Theft; whereupon she commanded the Bird to be restored to her Companions. After which they all, with one consent, flew away, so as that not any Bird of that kind was afterwards seen in that Territory.

               <p>ONE <hi>Eilwardus</hi> having in his Drink broke into a Man's house, and stole some of his Goods, such an Action of Felony was laid against him, that he was condemned to have his Eyes put out, and his Privities to be cut off, which Sentence was executed upon him; and he being in danger of Death by bleeding, was counselled to pray to St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> In the Night he had a Vision of one in white Apparel, who bid him <hi>watch and pray, and put his Trust in God, and our Lady, and holy St.</hi> Thomas. The next day the Man rubbing his Eyes, they were restored; and a little after rubbing the other place, his <hi>Pendenda,</hi> (as he calls them) were also restored, very small at the first, but growing still greater, which he permitted every one to feel that would.

               <p>Now there were in the same Island at some distance other Men also who liv'd solitary Lives: Of which some seem'd very fresh and youthful, others were decrepid old Men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> St. <hi>Patrick</hi> after some conversation with them, was informed that those very old Men were Children to those who appeared so youthful. At which being astonish'd, and enquiring the occasion of so great a Miracle, they thus acquainted him, saying, <hi>We from our Childhood by Divine Grace have been much addicted to Works of Mercy, so that our Doors were always open to all Travellers which demanded Meat or Lodging. On a certain Night it hapned that a Stranger, having a Staff in his hand, was entertain'd by us, whom we used with all the Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie we could. On the Morning after he gave us his Benediction, and said, I am</hi> Jesus Christ: <hi>My Members you have hitherto oft ministred to, and this Night entertain'd me in my own Person. After this he gave the Staff which he had in his hand to a Man of God, our Father both spiritually and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, commanding him to keep it, till in succeeding times a certain Stranger, named</hi> Patrick, <hi>should come to visit him: and to him he should give it. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving said this, he presently ascended into Heaven. And from that day we have remained in the same state of youthful Comliness and Vigour to this hour.</hi>

               <p>St. <hi>Patrick</hi> landed in the Province of <hi>Lenster</hi> in the Year 432. where having converted <hi>Sinel</hi> the Son of <hi>Finchado,</hi> he directed his Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ulster,</hi> where one <hi>Dicon</hi> coming suddenly with Weapons, intended to kill the Saint and his Companions.

                  <note place="margin">Matt.
