         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the <hi>Performance,</hi>
there can be no Objections made
againſt the <hi>Seaſonableneſs</hi> of
my preſent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking: For
if the Publication of this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Work had been longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd,
it wou'd have been a
hard Task for the Author to
have acquir'd the Reputation

while 'tis freſh and unfaded;

are oblig'd to depend on the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit

ſuppreſſes the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Actions of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
whoſe Memory it pretends
to preſerve. In the midſt of
ſo much Confuſion 'tis impoſſible
to avoid Miſtakes: For that
which bears the neareſt <hi>reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi>
to <hi>Truth</hi> is frequently
obſerv'd to be only a <hi>well-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
Lye;</hi> and oftentimes a
<hi>ſeeming Fable</hi> after a diligent
Enquiry, is found to be a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Truth.</hi> The Life of great
Perſons is full of <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
and thoſe <hi>Characters</hi> of
em, and <hi>Judgments</hi> concerning
<pb facs="tcp:51877:4"/>
their Actions that are founded
on the <hi>Idea</hi> they give of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on certain occaſions, rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amount to more than <hi>falſe,</hi> or
at beſt <hi>uncertain Conjectures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, if I had
publiſh'd this Hiſtory <hi>ſooner,</hi> it
might have been ſuſpected of
<hi>Flattery.</hi> The <hi>Miniſters</hi> of
great Princes are no leſs terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than their <hi>Maſters,</hi> and if
ever an impartial Hiſtorian
runs the hazard of an unjuſt
and rigorous Treatment, for a
faithful Repreſentation of the
Management of Affairs, 'tis
when he attempts to unſkreen
the Deſigns of thoſe who are
the preſent Diſpenſers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Puniſhments. If
<pb facs="tcp:51877:4"/>
M. <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Life had appear'd
while his <hi>Sons</hi> were actually
poſſeſs'd of the higheſt Poſts in
the Government, the Reader
might have juſtly ſuſpected me
of a Deſign to make my Court
to the <hi>Children,</hi> by writing a
Panegyrick on the <hi>Father.</hi> But
the preſent Poſture of Affairs
leaves no room for any ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I expect to be believ'd
when I proteſt that the only
Motive which engag'd me in
writing the Hiſtory of that
<hi>Great Miniſter,</hi> was my deſire
to acquaint Poſterity with the
moſt memorable Actions of his
Life. And as I began the
Work without the leaſt curb
<pb facs="tcp:51877:5"/>
upon my Sincerity, ſo in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of it I have confin'd my
ſelf to a ſcrupulous Obſervance
of the Truth: Nor have I been
leſs careful to expoſe his <hi>Faults,</hi>
than to do Juſtice to his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reader will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that I never take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to wander from my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
For he muſt not expect
to find in this Treatiſe a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
Hiſtory of the Reign of
<hi>Lewis XIV.</hi> but the Life of
one of his <hi>Chief Miniſters of
State,</hi> who ſuſtain'd not the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi>
Burthen of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but was confin'd to the
Management of certain <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
Affairs: And I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
<pb facs="tcp:51877:5"/>
with all poſſible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs,
to trace him thro' the
whole Courſe of his Life in
the diſcharge of his <hi>peculiar
Employments,</hi> without taking
notice of thoſe <hi>general Affairs</hi>
that were not properly a part of
his Province, any further than
he had a ſhare in 'em.</p>
            <p>I cou'd not forbear adorning
my Work with large and exact
Deſcriptions of his Majeſty's
<hi>principal Buildings,</hi> that were
erected under the Inſpection of
this Miniſter: For beſides that
Relations of this Nature are
extremely agreeable to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Ingenious part of
Mankind, theſe admirable
Works are ſo many convincing
<pb facs="tcp:51877:6"/>
Proofs of the Activity, Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
and indefatigable Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of him to whoſe Care
they were committed. The
Diſcharge of ſo important a
Truſt might have been the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
and glorious Occupation of
an <hi>ordinary Genius;</hi> but it
was the leaſt part of M. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s
Task. For beſides, he
had the Management of <hi>Naval
Affairs,</hi> and of the <hi>King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,</hi>
which he ſtill found
means to encreaſe by ſome new
Expedient. He was alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with the Care of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
<hi>Trade,</hi> and of improving
<hi>ingenious Arts:</hi> And 'tis the
duty of every <hi>Frenchman</hi> to
acknowledge that the Induſtry
<pb facs="tcp:51877:6"/>
and Politeneſs of our Artizans
is an effect of the admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of that Miniſter, and that
he depriv'd our Neighbours of
the Servile Tribute which our
waſteful Luxury paid to the
Arts that flouriſh'd among 'em.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Gratitude</hi> to M.
<hi>Colbert</hi> muſt not betray us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a diſingenuous <hi>partiality:</hi>
Neither ought we to be ſo daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled
with the pleaſing view of
the <hi>ſhining</hi> part of his Life, as
to forget or diſſemble his <hi>Faults.</hi>
For 'tis certain that he never
ſcrupl'd to commit any Act of
Injuſtice that might ſerve to
enrich his Sovereign; and that
notwithſtanding his affected
Probity, and ſeeming Neglect of
<pb facs="tcp:51877:7"/>
his own Intereſt, he omitted no
Opportunity to fill his Coffers
by indirect Methods. This is
the dark and blemiſh'd Reverſe
of his Character; and the truth
of theſe Aſſertions will appear
evidently to the attentive Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
of the following Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>To the Hiſtory of M. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
I have added that of his
Eldeſt Son, the Marqueſs of
<hi>Seignelay,</hi> who ſucceeded him
in the Offices of <hi>Secretary of
State,</hi> and of <hi>Commander</hi> and
<hi>Great Treaſurer of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Orders.</hi> At preſent there
are none of his Sons alive but

the Regiment of <hi>Champaign.</hi>

            <head>THE
LIFE
OF
<hi>John Baptiſt Colbert,</hi>
Miniſter, and Secretary
of STATE.</head>
            <p>THere is ſomething ſo ſingular and
ſurprizing, both in the <hi>Quickneſs</hi>
of <hi>Monſieur Colbert</hi>'s Advancement,
and the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of his Fortune,
that After-Ages will hardly be induc'd to give
Credit to that part of our Modern Hiſtory, if
they be not inform'd by what Steps and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
he rais'd himſelf to ſo high a Degree of
Power.</p>
            <p>He was of a middle Stature, rather Lean
than Fat; his Hair was black, and ſo thin,
that he was oblig'd to begin very ſoon to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51877:9"/>
make uſe of a Cap. His Mien was low and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected;
he had a gloomy Air, and ſtern A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
He ſpoke little, and would never return
a preſent Anſwer, till he had firſt receiv'd a
particular account in Writing of what was
propos'd to him. He manag'd Buſineſs with
unweary'd Application, and a ſurprizing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs:
the Clearneſs of his Judgment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abl'd
him to expedite all ſorts of Affairs ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
and without Confuſion. He was of a
ſlow Conception, but ſpoke judiciouſly of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, after he had fully comprehended
it. He was a Lover of Learning, tho'
he never apply'd himſelf to the Study of it.
He was a great Pretender to Probity; but tho'
he endeavour'd to perſwade the World that
he neglected his own Intereſt, and ſeem'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to owe his Riches merely to the King's
Bounty, he ſcrupl'd not to fill his Coffers by
indirect Methods. He affected a great deal
of Moderation in the beginning of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery;
but aſſoon as he ſaw his Fortune ſecur'd
by great Offices and powerful Alliances, he
gave a full Career to his vaſt Deſigns, and
ſpar'd nothing to advance his Glory, tho'
he manag'd his private Affairs with a great
deal of Frugality. He ſacrific'd Honour, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
Gratitude, and every thing elſe to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of his Ambition. The Hardneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibility
of his Temper was altogether inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable.
He beheld without concern the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
of an infinite number of Families, whom
he had ruin'd to enrich his Maſter's Treaſury.
But though he never employ'd his Power for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51877:9"/>
the good of others, it muſt be acknowledg'd
that he never ſhed the Blood of his Enemies.
He was crafty and ſubtil: His outward Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was modeſt, accompanied with a great
deal of ſeeming Plainneſs and Simplicity. He
lov'd, and was acquainted with ingenious
Arts: He ſlept little, and was ſober. Though
he was naturally ſowre and moroſe, he knew
how to act the part of a Lover in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of thoſe Ladies who had touch'd his
Heart; but he always treated 'em in publick
with his accuſtom'd Gravity, that he might
not be thought capable of ſuffering himſelf
to be govern'd by the fair Sex.</p>
            <p>He was the Son of <hi>Nicholas Colbert Sieur de
Vandieres,</hi> and of <hi>Mary Puſſort;</hi> and was born
at <hi>Rheims</hi> in <hi>Champaigne,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1625"/> in <hi>November</hi> 1625.
His Grand-father was a Wine-Merchant, and
his Father at firſt follow'd the ſame Occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but afterwards he traded in Cloth, and
laſt of all in Silk. Our future Miniſter was
very young when his Father ſent him to <hi>Paris,</hi>
to be inſtructed in the Arts of Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing:
From thence he went to <hi>Lyons,</hi> but
falling out with his Maſter, return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi>
where he was firſt Clerk to a Notary, and
then to <hi>Biterne,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1640"/> Attorney of the Chaſtelet,
whom he left to ſerve <hi>Sabathier,</hi> Treaſurer of
the Money rais'd by the Sale of Offices, in
the Quality of a Commiſſary or Deputy. In
the Year 1648. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1648"/> his Kinſman <hi>John Baptiſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
Lord of <hi>S. Poüange,</hi> preferr'd him to the
Service of <hi>Michael le Tellier,</hi> Secretary of State,
whoſe Siſter he had marry'd; and the Youth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51877:10"/>
was quickly taken notice of for his Diligence,
and Exactneſs in executing all the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that were entruſted to his Care.</p>
            <p>One day his Maſter ſent him to Cardinal
<hi>Mazarin</hi> with a Letter written by the Queen-Mother,
and order'd him to bring back the
Letter after that Miniſter had ſeen it. <hi>Colbert</hi>
arriving at <hi>Sedan,</hi> where the Cardinal then was,
preſented the Queen's Letter to him, with
another from <hi>le Tellier,</hi> to his Eminency; and
returning the next day for an Anſwer, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
only a ſeal'd Packet; but not ſeeing the
Queen's Letter, he ask'd the Cardinal for it,
who told him that all was in the Packet, and
bid him return to his Maſter. The wary
Meſſenger not ſatisfi'd with that Anſwer,
broke up the Seal in the Cardinal's Preſence,
who being ſurpriz'd at his Boldneſs, chid him
for his Sawcineſs, and ſnatch'd the Packet out
of his hand; <hi>Colbert,</hi> not in the leaſt daunted with
ſo rough a Treatment, reply'd, That he believ'd
his Eminency had entruſted the Care of cloſing
the Packet to one of his Secretaries, who, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
had forgotten to put in the Queen's Letter.
The Cardinal pretending Buſineſs put him off
till the next Day, but at laſt, after ſeveral Delays
and Denials, ſeeing him always at the Cloſet-Door,
he reſtor'd the Letter, which <hi>Colbert</hi>
view'd very attentively, to ſee whether it was
the ſame he deliver'd; and went away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſeeming to take notice of the Cardinal's
Anger, who ask'd him whether he thought
him capable of ſo much Baſeneſs as to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
a Paper. Some time after the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51877:10"/>
returning to Court, and wanting one to
write his <hi>Agenda,</hi> or <hi>Memorandums,</hi> deſir'd <hi>le
Tellier</hi> to furniſh him with a fit Perſon for that
Employment: and <hi>Colbert</hi> being preſented to
him, he had ſtill ſome confus'd Remembrance
of him, and was deſirous to know where he
had ſeen him. <hi>Colbert</hi> was afraid to put him
in mind of <hi>Sedan,</hi> leaſt the Remembrance of
his Importunacy, in demanding the Queen's
Letter, ſhould renew the Cardinal's Anger;
but his Eminency was ſo far from hating him
for his Faithfulneſs to his late Maſter, that he
receiv'd him on condition, That he ſhould
ſerve him with like Zeal and Fidelity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colbert</hi> apply'd himſelf wholly to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of his Maſter's Intereſts, and gave
him ſo many Marks of his Diligence and
Skill, that after the Death of <hi>Joubert</hi> his
Eminency's Intendant, he was choſen to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in that Poſt. He accommodated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo dexterouſly to the Inclinations of that
Miniſter, by retrenching his ſuperfluous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
that he was entruſted with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of that gainful Trade of ſelling Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
and Governments. It was by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
that the Cardinal oblig'd the Governours
of Frontier Places to maintain their Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
with the Contributions they exacted; and
his Eminency was extremely pleas'd with that
Advice. He was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to negotiate the
Reconciliation of Cardinal <hi>de Rets,</hi> for which
the Pope had ſhew'd ſome Concern, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
his Holineſs to conſent to the diſ-inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating
of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> according to the Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51877:11"/>
with his Predeceſſour <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. At
his Return, to requite his good Services, he was
made Secretary of the Queen's Diſpatches,
which Office he afterwards ſold to <hi>Briſacier,</hi>
Maſter of the Court of Accounts, and bought
that of Preſident in the ſame Company, who
happily for him, but unhappily for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
would not receive him; for he became
their greateſt Enemy, and depriv'd 'em of the
profit of the <hi>Debets</hi> of Accounts, for which he
made a Bargain with <hi>Vilette,</hi> and afterwards
with others, to the great Prejudice of the
Chamber, tho' the King did not receive much
Advantage by the Alteration.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as he ſaw himſelf in Favour at
Court, he began to think of a convenient
Match, and took to Wife <hi>Mary Charon,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>James Charon, Sieur de Menars,</hi> a Native
of <hi>Blois,</hi> (who of a Cooper and Wine-Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
was become Pay-Maſter of the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try),
and of <hi>Mary Begon</hi> his Wife. <hi>Charon</hi>
had higher Deſigns, for he look'd upon his
Daughter as one of the Richeſt Matches in
<hi>Paris,</hi> by reaſon of the great Legacies and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances
that would fall to her: but at laſt
he conſented to this Propoſal, that he might
be exempted from a Tax with which he was
threatned. The great Reſpect which <hi>Colbert</hi>
ſhew'd to his Wife did not hinder him from
gratifying in ſome meaſure his particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
and from yielding to the Charms
of <hi>Frances de Godet,</hi> Widow of <hi>John Gravé
Sieur de Launay,</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> Lady, of a ſmooth
and inſinuating Temper, the uſual Character
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51877:11"/>
of thoſe of her Country. She was of a
graceful Stature, and Majeſtick Gate: Her
Face was round, her Complexion white and
clear, her Hair light, and her Eyes blue. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay
Gravé</hi> a rich Partizan marry'd her after
the Death of his firſt Wife, whoſe Servant ſhe
had been, and left her a great Eſtate. <hi>Colbert</hi>
took care to introduce his Miſtreſs to the
Queen and Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> with whom
he made her play very frequently; and ſhe
made uſe of thoſe Privileges for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of him who procur'd 'em to her; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a quick and piercing Wit, ſhe gave
him notice of every thing ſhe heard, that had
any relation to his Intereſts: nor was he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
to one that had done him ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Service; for he contriv'd a way to make
her the Wife of <hi>Anthony de Broüille,</hi> Marqueſs
of <hi>Piene,</hi> Knight of the Orders, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Pignerol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marchioneſs of <hi>Piene</hi> was not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Perſon that touch'd the Heart of <hi>Colbert:</hi>
for beſides her, he made Love to <hi>Ann Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
Vanel,</hi> Wife of <hi>John Coiſſier,</hi> Maſter of the
Court of Accounts, a young Lady of a low
Stature, but extremely pretty, and adorn'd
with all the Advantages of a gay Humour
and lively Wit. His frequent Viſits, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at her Houſe were aſcrib'd to his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Friendſhip with her Father-in-law, who
had been Receiver of the Conſignations with
<hi>Betaut,</hi> and to the Leſſons of Politicks he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
took from her Husband, who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
well acquainted with all the Negotiations
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51877:12"/>
and Intrigues of the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> as
having been Secretary to the Embaſſy under
<hi>Abel de Servien,</hi> whoſe Deputy he ſtill was
in the Super-Intendancy. But our States-Man
was ſoon weary of the Levity and Fickleneſs
of that Lady, and reſign'd his Pretenſions
to his Brother <hi>Edward Francis Colbert,</hi> whom
he had made Captain of the Guards, to <hi>Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerau</hi>
Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Secretary, and to
the Commander of <hi>Gault,</hi> who had more time
to beſtow on their Amours. Ambition was
the predominant Paſſion of <hi>John Baptiſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
and though he had not yet arriv'd to that
eminent height of Grandeur, to which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
attain'd, he had already advanc'd all
his Brothers. For he had obtain'd the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy
of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> with the Dignity of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
<hi>à Mortier</hi> in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> for
<hi>Charles Colbert,</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Luçon,</hi>
with the Office of the King's Library-Keeper
for his Brother <hi>Nicholas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarin</hi> at his Death recommended <hi>Colbert</hi>
to his Majeſty, as a fit Perſon to regulate Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
relating to the <hi>Finances</hi> which ſtood much
in need of Reformation: for <hi>Nicholas Fouquet,</hi>
who was then Superintendant, had borrow'd
ſuch vaſt Summs, that he was above four
Years behind-hand. He had rais'd Rents on
the <hi>Third Peny</hi> and a <hi>Half,</hi> which nevertheleſs
yielded no more than the <hi>Seventh Peny,</hi> becauſe
only two Quarters were paid, and even that
was very much. He had alſo erected Offices
without Charge, and had deliver'd blank Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
which the Purchaſers were to enjoy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51877:12"/>
ſupplying the Places, ſo that the King
was depriv'd of his Right to Surrenders. And
beſides there was a <hi>Third Part</hi> remitted at each
Bargain, which oppreſs'd the People without
the leaſt Advantage to the King. The Edicts
were chang'd to Bills or Tickets, which were
afterwards cut into ſo many Pieces, that 'twas
impoſſible to know the Original: and he paid
ſo exceſſive Rates of Intereſt for the Loans he
receiv'd, that the Crown muſt have for ever
remain'd unable to diſcharge the Summs, if
a quick Stop had not been put to theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.
The King reſolv'd to entruſt the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of his Revenue to <hi>Colbert,</hi> having already
receiv'd ſome Marks of his Frugality: for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd
that he had ſav'd him a conſiderable
Summ of Money, by changing the fine Silver
Edgings that were fitted to the Ribbons with
which the Habits of the <hi>Hundred Switzers</hi>
were adorn'd, to counterfeit Lace: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Majeſty made him Intendant of the
<hi>Finances,</hi> together with <hi>Breteuil, Marin,</hi> and
<hi>Hervard;</hi> and erected a Chamber of Juſtice,
compos'd of Six Counſellours of State, Six
Maſters of Requeſts, Four Counſellours of the
Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> Two Counſellours of the
Great Council, Two Maſters of the Court
of Accounts, Two Counſellours of the Court
of Aids, and a Counſellour out of each of
the other Parliaments, to call to an account,
and arraign ſuch Farmers as were guilty of
Miſdemeanors. The Chamber, for a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of their Juſtice, and for an Example and
Terrour to the reſt of theſe Officers, caus'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51877:13"/>
ſome of the meaneſt of 'em to be hang'd:
and theſe Executions made way for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
of the Superintendant, the Three
Treaſurers of the Exchequer, and the richeſt
Partizans or Farmers.</p>
            <p>Before they proceeded to ſecure <hi>Fouquet,</hi>
he was dexterouſly perſwaded to reſign the
Office of Attorney-General of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
of <hi>Paris,</hi> leſt he ſhould claim the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
which that Dignity gave him of being
try'd by the Chambers in a full Aſſembly. He
was apprehended at <hi>Nantes</hi> on the <hi>Fifth</hi> of
<hi>September,</hi> 1661. whither the Court was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
to quiet ſome Diſorders in <hi>Bretaigne:</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1661"/> he
was afterwards carry'd from thence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
cloſe Priſoner to the Caſtel of St. <hi>Angers,</hi>
where he was ſeiz'd with a very dangerous
Sickneſs. At the ſame time the Papers which
he brought along with him were ſecur'd, and
the Seal affix'd to his Houſes at <hi>Paris, S. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dé</hi>
and <hi>Vaux,</hi> and to his Apartments at the
<hi>Louvre.</hi> His Papers that were ſeiz'd at <hi>Nantes,</hi>
with thoſe of his Deputy <hi>Peliſſon,</hi> were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
for ſeveral days by <hi>Boucherat,</hi> Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of State, <hi>Pellot,</hi> Maſter of Requeſts, and
<hi>Colbert;</hi> and afterwards tranſmitted to <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainbleau</hi>
without taking an Inventory of 'em.
The Seal was affix'd on his Houſe at <hi>Paris</hi>
by the Lieutenant-Civil, aſſiſted by the King's
Advocate of the <hi>Chaſtelet,</hi> for the Intereſt of
the Publick, and in preſence of the Priſoner's
domeſtick Servants. The ſame Ceremonies
were not obſerv'd at <hi>Fontainbleau;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they miſtruſted the Exactneſs of <hi>Poncet,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51877:13"/>
who was one of the Commiſſioners, they
ſent him to aſſiſt at the taking of the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of S. <hi>Mandé. Barin de la Galiſſoniere</hi> was
ſubſtituted in his Place, but <hi>d' Aligre,</hi> Director
of the Finances, and <hi>Colbert,</hi> manag'd the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
alone, and proceeded with ſo much Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs
and Diligence, that they ſpent even
<hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holydays</hi> in that Occupation. The
greateſt part of 'em were not ſubſign'd, and
even they carried the Bundles to his Majeſty's
Cloſet without marking their Numbers. As
for the Papers at S. <hi>Mandé, Poncet</hi> had brought
'em to <hi>Fontainbleau;</hi> but after he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the King, that, according to the
Forms of Juſtice, they ought to remain in the
place where they were found, till the Perſon
who own'd 'em was brought to an Account,
his Majeſty commanded 'em to be carry'd
back to S. <hi>Mandé.</hi> The King had appointed
the Lieutenant-Civil to affix the Seal to that
Houſe; but <hi>Colbert</hi> ſuppreſs'd a ſecond Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which gave that Commiſſion to <hi>Benard</hi>
and <hi>l' Alleman,</hi> Maſters of the Requeſts. By
Virtue of this laſt Order, the Seal was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd
on the <hi>8th</hi> of the ſame Month of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
by thoſe Commiſſioners, in preſence
of <hi>Charles de la Nouë</hi> and <hi>Jacob Bezemont,</hi> the
Priſoner's Servants. But <hi>Colbert</hi> ſuſpecting
'em of Remiſſneſs and Neglect, obtain'd a
new Commiſſion for <hi>Lauzon</hi> and <hi>la Foſſe,</hi>
Counſellours of State, who with <hi>Poncet</hi> were
appointed to take the Inventory: after which,
the firſt Commiſſioners having own'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniz'd
their Seal, deliver'd up the Keys of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51877:14"/>
the Doors, Trunks and Cupboards, to
thoſe who were appointed to ſucceed 'em,
who affix'd a new Seal, though their Power
did not reach ſo far, and put the Signet
(which they ought to have kept) into the
hands of <hi>Foucaut,</hi> Clerk to the Commiſſion,
and <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Creature, who by this means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Maſter of all the Papers, ſince the Keys
were entruſted to his Clerk. And therefore
aſſoon as he was inform'd that <hi>Foucaut</hi> was
Maſter of all, leaving his Buſineſs at <hi>Fontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau,</hi>
he went immediately to S. <hi>Mandé</hi> to be
preſent at the taking of the Inventory, tho'
he had no Authority to go thither. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that made him ſo deſirous to ſeize on
theſe Papers, was not only to deprive <hi>Fouquet</hi>
of what might ſerve for his Defence, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to ſecure himſelf againſt all Accuſations by
ſuppreſſing thoſe Papers which might have
diſcover'd his Guilt. For, during the Life of
Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> the Adminiſtration of
three fourth Parts of the Charge of Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant,
and the Receipt and Disburſement
of the beſt part of the Money in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
was manag'd in that Miniſter's Palace,

As for his Cheating the Publick, or

'twas pretended that he had taken intereſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretext of forg'd Loans; that he had
advanc'd Money which he ought not to have

there was no Pretext to diſpoſſeſs 'em. To
conceal that Bribe, <hi>Colbert</hi> rais'd the Cardinal's
Benefices a hundred thouſand Livres, which
<hi>Girardin</hi> at the ſame time took to farm. Since
<hi>Fouquet</hi> had no hand in that Affair, there was
no mention made of it at his Trial, though
it was a part of his Charge. 'Tis plain from

what happen'd on occaſion of the Woods of
<hi>Normandy,</hi> that <hi>Colbert</hi> was as much concern'd
as <hi>Fouquet</hi> in Treaties of that Nature: For
<hi>Berrier</hi> and <hi>Bechamel</hi> who farm'd 'em, ſeeing

after which the whole Buſineſs was huſh'd

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1662"/> On the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1662,  <hi>Fouquet</hi> was
examin'd the firſt time by <hi>Poncet,</hi> Maſter of
Requeſts, and <hi>Renaud</hi> Counſellour in the

him, and others alledg'd by <hi>Denys Talon,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate-General
of the ſame Parliament,
and Attorney-General of the Chamber.
The Examination laſted above a Month,
and they proceeded no farther till <hi>June.
Fouquet</hi> had all along refus'd to own the
Authority of the Chamber; and though
the King's Council had by ſeveral Orders
confirm'd its Juriſdiction, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to ſubmit and give in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
under pain of being proceeded againſt
as Mute, he ſtill perſiſted in his Plea, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Authority of the Court. Yet his
Proceſs was appointed by an Order of the
Chamber, dated <hi>October</hi> 4. 1662. and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>le Fevre d' Ormeſſon,</hi> Maſter of Requeſts,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1664"/> 
               <hi>Fouquet</hi> was brought from <hi>Vincennes</hi> on the
<hi>14th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1664. to the Chamber of
Juſtice in the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> to be examin'd on the
Criminals Seat; and the examination conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
till the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> when <hi>d' Ormeſſon</hi>
began to make his report, adjudging him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Baniſhment, and his Eſtate to be forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the King, paying a Fine of a hundred
thouſand Livres. <hi>Sainte Helene,</hi> who was alſo
empower'd to make the Report, voted for
Death, adding, That though the Evidence
was ſtrong enough to convict him of <hi>Peculate</hi>
or of Robbing and Embezelling the King's
Treaſure, which ought by the Law to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with Hanging; yet he was of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that the Priſoner ſhould only be beheaded.
<hi>Sainte Helene</hi> was follow'd, and his Judgment
confirm'd by <hi>Puſſort, Colbert</hi>'s Uncle, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour
in the great Council; <hi>Feriol,</hi> Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

Maſter of Requeſts; and <hi>Philip de Pontchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train,</hi>
Preſident in the Chamber of Accounts,
<hi>Poncet</hi> and <hi>Voiſin</hi> gave Judgment of Death,
as well as the Chancellour; but it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
for Baniſhment by four Voices; after
which Sentence was given on the <hi>20th</hi> of
<hi>December,</hi> 1664. according to <hi>d' Ormeſſon</hi>'s
Verdict.</p>
            <p>The King being inform'd of the Nature of
the Sentence, and conſidering that it might be a
thing of dangerous Conſequence, to ſend a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
out of the Kingdom, who was ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
acquainted with the moſt important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the State, chang'd the Puniſhment to
perpetual Impriſonment, and order'd him to
be carry'd to <hi>Pignerol</hi> on the Frontiers of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> whither he began his Journey two
days after, under a Guard of a hundred Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers,
and there ended his Life in the Year
1680. Immediately after his Condemnation,
his Mother and Wife receiv'd Orders to retire
to <hi>Montluçon</hi> in <hi>Bourbonnois,</hi> with his Brother
<hi>Fouquet,</hi> the King's firſt Gentleman of the
Horſe. His Son-in-law, the Marqueſs of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rôt,</hi>
with his Wife, were order'd to <hi>Anceni</hi> in
<hi>Bretaigne;</hi> and <hi>Bailly,</hi> Advocate-General of the
Great Council, was commanded to retire to
his Abbey of St. <hi>Thierry,</hi> becauſe he pleaded
for him with too much eagerneſs.</p>
            <p>The Difference between the Tempers of
<hi>Colbert</hi> and <hi>Fouquet,</hi> appears plainly by their
Carriage to the Author of the <hi>Burleſque Gazette,</hi>
who beſides a Penſion of two hundred Livres
from <hi>Mademoiſelle de Monpenſier,</hi> had another
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51877:17"/>
of two hundred Crowns allow'd him by <hi>Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.</hi>
This Gazetteer after his unfortunate Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactour
was apprehended, ſpoke advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
of him in his Gazette, proteſting that
though he would not meddle with Affairs of
State, he cou'd not forbear expreſſing his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
for the Obligations he had receiv'd.
<hi>Colbert,</hi> knowing that he had a Penſion, took it
from him; which <hi>Fouquet,</hi> who was then in
the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> had no ſooner heard, but he reſolv'd
to make up that Loſs with Advantage, tho'
he was depriv'd of all his Eſtate, and in a
Condition that requir'd vaſt Summs of Money
to defray his neceſſary Charges. For <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle
de Scudery,</hi> at his deſire, ſent fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Livres to <hi>Loret</hi> by a truſty Meſſenger,
who after he had diſcours'd with him for a
conſiderable time, took occaſion to leave that
Summ in a Purſe without his Knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bruant des Carrieres,</hi> Maſter of the Court of
Accounts, and <hi>Fouquet</hi>'s firſt Deputy, made his
eſcape out of the Kingdom, and retir'd to
<hi>Liege</hi> aſſoon as his Maſter was ſecur'd. But
the Chamber indited him for Contempt, and
condemn'd him to be hang'd; after which his
Office in the Court of Accounts was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd.
He had bought of <hi>Margaret Ranchin,</hi>
Widow of <hi>Claude Vanel,</hi> a Houſe in <hi>New-ſtreet</hi>
in the <hi>Little Fields,</hi> for 150000 Livres, in the
Name of <hi>Joan de Chaumont,</hi> Widow of <hi>Claude
Girardin.</hi> This Houſe ſtood very convenient
for <hi>Colbert,</hi> who liv'd in another contiguous to
it, which he had purchas'd of <hi>Batru:</hi> and the
Temptation was ſo ſtrong, that he us'd all his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51877:17"/>
Art to make himſelf Maſter of the Houſe,
without putting his hand in his Purſe. At
laſt he took advantage of ſeveral Orders or
Sentences of the Chamber of Juſtice, by
which the Widow and Heirs of <hi>Vanel</hi> were
fin'd in 350000 Livres, and under that pretext
procur'd Widow <hi>Girardin</hi> to be aſſign'd in a
Declaration of Mortgage. But ſince theſe
Proceedings were of no greater Force in Law
than the Judgment of the ſame Chamber,
by which a great Tax was already laid on
<hi>Claude Girardin,</hi> the Son of <hi>Joan Chaumont,
Colbert</hi> tax'd or aſſeſs'd the Inheritance of
<hi>Claude Girardin,</hi> the Father, at a hundred and
twenty thouſand Livres, though he had never
been concern'd in the King's Affairs, nor had
ever enjoy'd any other Office than that of
Comptroller of the Sallaries of the Officers of
the Parliament at <hi>Rhoan,</hi> for which he was not
at all liable to account. By Virtue of theſe
Sentences a Decree was obtain'd, no leſs irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
than the reſt of the Proceedings, and
the Houſe was adjudg'd to <hi>Colbert,</hi> againſt the
Heirs both of <hi>Vanel</hi> and <hi>Girardin,</hi> for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty thouſand Livres, deducting
the Summs due to the King: but <hi>Colbert</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
the Validity of his Title, procur'd a
Grant of it from his Majeſty. During the
Proſecution of <hi>Fouquet</hi>'s Deputies and Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<hi>Bruant</hi> ſtay'd at <hi>Liege,</hi> where he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſuch conſiderable Services to the State in
1672, that he obtain'd a Pardon, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Paris</hi> after <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Death, thinking
to be reinſtated in the Poſſeſſion of his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51877:18"/>
Houſe: but he had only the Advantage of
venting his Paſſion in his Writings, for the
Council would not meddle with what had
been decreed by the Chamber of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul Peliſſon</hi> had the good Fortune to eſcape
the Fate of his Fellow-Deputy: For <hi>Colbert</hi>'s
Ambition to be thought Learned, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the Eſteem of thoſe who were really ſo,
prompted him not only to procure his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but to take him into his own Service, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his late Maſter's Condemnation. <hi>Peliſſon</hi>
was the younger Son of a Counſellour in the
Court of Judicature eſtabliſh'd by the Edict
of <hi>Caſtres:</hi> his Patrimony was inconſiderable,
but his Learning and Politeneſs ſupply'd the
Defects of his Fortune. His Elder Brother
bought a Counſellour's Place in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Court of <hi>Breſſe,</hi> which was afterwards
united to the Parliament of <hi>Mets:</hi> and our
Cadet went to <hi>Paris</hi> with <hi>Iſarn,</hi> Brother to the
Clerk of the above-mention'd Court, inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Edict. Theſe two Adventurers
were intimate Friends, and there was a great
Affinity between their Tempers: they were
both remarkable for Sweetneſs of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and could write as well in Verſe as in
Proſe. But there was not the ſame Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
between their Faces; for the <hi>Small-pox</hi>
had very much disfigur'd <hi>Peliſſon</hi>'s, (whoſe Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were not very regular before,) by leaving
Marks of its Fury on his Fore-head and
Cheeks, and ſo diſtorting his Eye-lids, that
the White was too much uncover'd. On the
contrary, <hi>Iſarn</hi> was form'd for Love, his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51877:18"/>
Complexion, Features, Hair (which was
black, curl'd, and in great abundance), and
every thing elſe were graceful and agreeable.
They addreſs'd themſelves both together to
<hi>Mademoiſelle de Scudery,</hi> and endeavour'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
her with the Productions of their Wit:
<hi>Peliſſon</hi> made <hi>Stanza's</hi> on a <hi>Linget</hi> that was her
Favourite; and <hi>Iſarn</hi> wrote the <hi>Louis d' Or,</hi>
a ſmall <hi>Miſcellany</hi> of <hi>Proſe</hi> and <hi>Verſe.</hi> But at
laſt ſhe declar'd for the former, and preferr'd
his <hi>Linget</hi> to the other's <hi>Louis d' Or.</hi> She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
in her <hi>Cyrus</hi> her Amours with <hi>Peliſſon,</hi>
under the Names of <hi>Sappho</hi> and <hi>Phaon;</hi> and to
ſhew that her Paſſion was beyond the Reach
of Matter, and would never make her throw
her ſelf into the Sea after the Example of that
Learned <hi>Graecian</hi> Lady, ſhe drew in her <hi>Clelia</hi>
a Scheme of her Love, which ſhe call'd <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Friendſhip.</hi> And even ſhe could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
diſcovering to <hi>Peliſſon</hi> her Inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him, in theſe Extemporary Verſes.</p>

Mind to be ſatisfy'd with ſuch Trifles. The
<hi>French Academy</hi> had ſo great an Eſteem for
him, that they admitted him into their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
though there was no Place vacant. He
wrote the Hiſtory of that Society, enrich'd
with an Account of its Inſtitution and Statutes,
and the Lives of its Members: The Subject
he undertook is deſcrib'd with a great deal of
Exactneſs, and the Reader is ſometimes divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a pleaſant Mixture of Praiſe and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
as in the Account of <hi>Voiture.</hi> This Work
was very much eſteem'd, and rais'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of its Author: <hi>Fouquet,</hi> who had
read it, receiv'd very favourably the Propoſal
which <hi>Mademoiſelle de Scudery</hi> made him, of
making that <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> one of his Deputies;
and from that time entruſted him with the
Care of Framing the Draughts of all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Importance, which he was oblig'd to
write. He plac'd an entire Confidence in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51877:19"/>
him, and beſtow'd on him a newly-erected
Office in the Court of Accounts, Aids, and
Finances at <hi>Montpelier,</hi> where he was receiv'd
in <hi>November</hi> 1659, when the Court paſs'd
that way. He gave him a very ſignal Mark
of his Affection, when, upon his bare Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
he protected <hi>de Mance,</hi> Farmer of
the Gabels in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> with ſo much Zeal
and Eagerneſs againſt the whole Province,
who had conſpir'd that Officer's Ruine. Nor
was <hi>Peliſſon</hi> an ingrateful Servant; for 'tis well
known with what Vigour and Eloquence he
vindicated his Maſter from the Crimes that
were laid to his Charge. <hi>Colbert,</hi> who had
ſeen the Collection of all thoſe Pieces, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Holland</hi> in Six Volumes, conceiv'd ſo
high an Eſteem for the Author, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
not only to ſet him at Liberty, but to
gain him entirely, by beſtowing Favours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him: and <hi>Peliſſon</hi> transferr'd all the Fidelity
with which he had ſerv'd <hi>Fouquet,</hi> to his new
Maſter. 'Twas he who inſpir'd that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
with a Deſire to be admitted into the
<hi>French Academy,</hi> into which he was receiv'd in
the Place of <hi>Silhon, An. 1667. Colbert</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
alſo in his Service <hi>des Chiens,</hi> another
of <hi>Fouquet</hi>'s Deputies, but for a different Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
for he thought he ow'd no leſs a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to one that had done him ſuch accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Service, by furniſhing him with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
againſt his Maſter. But 'tis impoſſible
to love a Traitour long, and <hi>Colbert</hi> ſhortly
after turn'd away that unfaithful Servant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:51877:20"/>
Notwithſtanding my Reſolution to obſerve
the Order of Time with as much Exactneſs
as a Work of this Nature will admit, I thought
fit to make an uninterrupted Relation of the
Fall and Diſgrace of <hi>Fouquet</hi> and his Deputies;
I ſhall in the next place, give an Account of
the new Regulation of the <hi>Finances,</hi> and the
Advancement of <hi>Colbert</hi> on the Ruines of that
unfortunate Officer.</p>
            <p>Immediately after <hi>Fouquet</hi>'s Impriſonment,
the Office of Superintendant was ſuppreſs'd,
and a Council of the <hi>Finances</hi> eſtabliſh'd, of
which the <hi>Mareſchal de Villeroy</hi> was declar'd the
Chief. <hi>Colbert</hi> claim'd Admittance into that
Council, not only as Intendant, but alſo by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his Office of Comptroller-General,
which he enjoy'd alone, though it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
divided between <hi>Bretenil</hi> and <hi>Marin</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the other three Intendants, with the two
Directors of the <hi>Finances, d' Aligre</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangis,</hi>
were alſo admitted into the Council.
Though <hi>Colbert</hi> had not the Name of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant,
he had all the Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that ever was enjoy'd by <hi>Fouquet,</hi> only
with this difference, that all his Orders were
preſented to the King for his Approbation.</p>
            <p>They left off diſcharging the old Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer-Tickets,
which paſs'd Current in Trade,
at the Rate of the <hi>Tenth Peny,</hi> becauſe the
Farmers gave them in part of Payment
for their Taxes, after the full Pardon that was
granted them on Condition of diſcharging
the Tickets by an Edict publiſh'd in <hi>December,
1665,</hi> and verify'd by the Parliament on the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51877:20"/>
               <hi>21ſt,</hi> of the ſame Month; after which the
Price of theſe Tickets fell ſo low, that one
of a hundred thouſand Livres has been ſold
for fifty Piſtols. <hi>Colbert</hi> took that occaſion to
buy up a great number of 'em, and by reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
their full Value, made himſelf Maſter
of thoſe immenſe Summs, with which he
purchas'd the Marquiſates of <hi>Seignelay,</hi> and
<hi>Blainville,</hi> and the Baronies of <hi>Monetau, Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Beaumont,</hi> and <hi>Sceaux,</hi> with ſeveral other
conſiderable Eſtates.</p>
            <p>The new Rents which yielded exceſſive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
were ſuppreſs'd, and the Proprietors
ordain'd to deliver up their Contracts to be
diſcuſs'd, to <hi>de Seve</hi> Counſellour of State, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd
by the King for that Effect. The
Reimburſement was intended for the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Taxes of thoſe that were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
their Heirs, Deputies, and Partners:
and for thoſe who had never been concern'd
with the King's Affairs, the Poſſeſſion was
laid upon the actual Payment of the <hi>Finance,</hi> by
which means the Proprietors recover'd very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
Nor was this all, for even thoſe were tax'd
who in their Treaties had transferr'd Reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements
of Rents or other Rights and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
held of the King. And there was a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Office erected in the Houſe of <hi>Puſſort,
Colbert</hi>'s Uncle, for re-purchas'd Rents, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of an Edict dated <hi>January</hi> 1665, and
verify'd or approv'd on the <hi>14th</hi> of the ſame
Month.</p>
            <p>The Suppreſſion of the Rents procur'd a
great Number of Enemies to <hi>Colbert:</hi> and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51877:21"/>
even one day going to viſit Chancellour <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier,</hi>
he was beſieg'd in the Court by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
who held the Rents, ſome of whom
had the Confidence to threaten him. He
ſeem'd to hear their Reaſons, but his Deſign
was to learn the Names of the Mutiniers:
and at night he inform'd the King of what
had happen'd, who order'd 'em to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.
He thought the Impriſonment of
thoſe who were moſt forward, would have
impos'd Silence on the reſt; but he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
for ſome one or other appear'd every
day to fright him. His Deputies, who were
more fearful than he, endeavour'd to diſſwade
him from proceeding in that Affair, but
could not prevail. It happen'd one Night,
that <hi>Picon,</hi> his chief Deputy, who had the
Misfortune to love Wine too much, ſtarted
out of his Sleep, imagining that the Tenants
held him by the Throat. The Noiſe he made
alarm'd the whole Houſe, and <hi>Colbert</hi> among
the reſt, who being inform'd of the Occaſion
of the Diſturbance, turn'd away the poor
Drunkard next Morning; tho', at the Deſire
of ſome Perſons whom he could not deny,
and on the Aſſurance they gave him that the
Man was reform'd, he receiv'd him again
ſome Years after, and kept him till his
Death.</p>
            <p>'Twas not thought ſufficient to take the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſements
for the Payment of the Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but the Offices, Lands, Houſes, and
other immoveable Goods belonging to the
Three Treaſurers of the Exchequer, the two
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51877:21"/>
               <hi>Monerots, Languet</hi> and <hi>Banſſe</hi> were ſeiz'd and
adjudg'd to the King's Uſe. Several Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
made advantage of theſe Spoils: The
Houſe of <hi>Sevre de Monerot</hi> the Elder was given
to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to be united to his
Park at S. <hi>Cloud;</hi> his Houſe at <hi>Paris</hi> to the
Duke of <hi>Luxemburg;</hi> and <hi>Monerot</hi> the Younger's
Houſe was beſtow'd on the <hi>Mareſchal de Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>
They did not content themſelves with
ſeizing the Eſtates of the actual Poſſeſſours;
but the ſame Judgment was awarded againſt
Children, even though they had renounc'd
their Fathers Inheritance; and againſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers,
who had paid the Price of the Eſtates
in Ready Money; nor could they prevent
their Ruine, by ſheltering themſelves under
the Authority of the Decree, which clears
all Mortgages, and takes away all Encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances.
The Sons-in-law of thoſe who had
been concern'd in theſe Affairs, not only loſt
all the Immoveable or Real Eſtates they had
receiv'd in Dowry with their Wives, but
were forc'd to pay the Taxations that were
impos'd on their Fathers-in law, without the
leaſt Regard to their Dignities; for Soldiers
were quarter'd in the Houſes of<note n="*" place="margin">So called from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cap they uſually wear.</note> Preſidents
<hi>a Mortier,</hi> merely becauſe they had marry'd
the Daughters of Farmers. Thus 'tis plain,
that theſe Perſons could no longer be call'd
the King's Tutors, who attempted to uſurp
the Sovereign Authority during the King's
Minority. The Offices of the Treaſurers of
the Exchequer were ſuppreſs'd; and <hi>Bartillac,</hi>
who had been Treaſurer to the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51877:22"/>
was made Keeper of the Royal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
Theſe violent Proceedings interrupted
the Trade of the Kingdom, without bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any conſiderable Summs into the King's
Coffers, by reaſon of the great Charge which
the Proſecution of the Deſign requir'd: and
therefore <hi>Colbert</hi> perceiving that he had made
himſelf the Object of the publick Hatred,
agreed with Twelve of the richeſt Farmers,
who undertook the Affair on Condition that
they ſhould be exempted from the Payment
of their own Taxes; like Soldiers, who ſave
themſelves from the Gallows by performing
the Office of Executioner upon their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
But in the midſt of all thoſe Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
the Family of <hi>Launay Gravé</hi> remain'd
free from all manner of Proſecutions: and
<hi>Colbert,</hi> who ſtill retain'd a Kindneſs for the
Marchioneſs of <hi>Pienes,</hi> procur'd all her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſements
to be given her; a Favour
which ſhe ow'd to his delightful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his old Amours.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have ſhew'd <hi>Colbert</hi> on the moſt
diſadvantageous ſide, but now I muſt turn
the Reverſe of the Medal. <hi>France</hi> is oblig'd to
this Miniſter for the Eſtabliſhment of her
Trade with the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
that the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who inhabit a barren
Country void of all Conveniencies, owe their
Power and Riches to their Trade; from
whence he concluded, that the King, who
poſſeſs'd in his own Dominions all that his
Neighbours wanted, had a much fairer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Succeſs in ſuch an Undertaking. He
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51877:22"/>
form'd and brought together two Companies,
one for the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and another for the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and the King declar'd himſelf Protector
of both, granting 'em great Privileges, and
obliging himſelf by Contract, to lend 'em Six
Millions, without Intereſt. And beſides, to
encreaſe the Fund, his Majeſty engag'd the
Judges and Merchants in the ſame Deſign,
who were tax'd proportionably to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.
Theſe Companies have ſince ſettl'd
Factories in the Principal Cities of the <hi>Indies,</hi>
and the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> who is one of the
moſt powerful Princes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſent Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
to his Majeſty in the Year 1686.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>January, 1664. Colbert</hi>
bought of <hi>Ratabon</hi> the Office of Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of the Buildings, and from that time
forward apply'd himſelf with ſo much Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
and Succeſs to the Enlargement and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhment
of the Royal Houſes, that they are
at preſent ſo many Maſter-Pieces of Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
He began with the Palace of the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illeries,</hi>
to which he join'd the Garden that
was ſeparated from it by the Street. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
a large <hi>Parterre</hi> or Flower-Garden to be
made before the Building, with three Baſons,
diſpos'd after the manner of a Triangle. By
his Directions the Bird-houſe, <hi>Mademoiſelle de
Guiſe</hi>'s Lodgings, and all the other Houſes as
far as the Gate of <hi>Conference,</hi> were beaten
down, to make room for the <hi>Terraſs</hi> that runs
along the River, as there is another oppoſite
to this, towards the Manage of the Great
Stables. A large Alley was planted there with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51877:23"/>
               <hi>Indian</hi> Cheſnut-Trees, with two ſmall ones on
each ſide, reaching to <hi>Renard</hi>'s Garden, which
was taken in within the Incloſure of the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illeries,</hi>
where the <hi>Terraſs</hi> is cut through the
Middle, to leave the Proſpect of the<note n="*" place="margin">This name is given to publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, (ſuch as <hi>Hide-Park)</hi> where Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity take the Air.</note> 
               <hi>Cours</hi>
unobſtructed, with a Paſſage to aſcend thither
on both ſides, and a large Baſon or Vaſe of a
Fountain in the midſt of the Garden, that
takes up the greateſt Part of it. On the
right hand a Theatre was erected on a Graſs-plot,
for the Repreſentation of Comedies, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
by a kind of <hi>Parterre,</hi> from an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre,
which is capable of containing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a thouſand Perſons, who may from
thence conveniently behold the Shows that
are preſented on the Theatre. 'Twould be
an endleſs Labour to deſcribe all the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that are to be ſeen in the <hi>Tuilleries;</hi> ſuch
as the Labyrinth, the Orange-houſe, and the
Marble Statue that repreſents <hi>Time,</hi> treading
on <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Falſhood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1665. <hi>Colbert</hi> ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> for
<hi>Cavalier Bernin,</hi> to frame the Deſign of the
<hi>Louvre,</hi> and procur'd him a Penſion of two
thouſand Crowns. That Illuſtrious <hi>Italian,</hi>
whoſe excellent Skill extended equally to Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
and Architecture, made the <hi>Buſt</hi> or
Half-Statue of the King, that adorns his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Cabinet. That admirable Piece not
only repreſents all the Features of that great
Monarch to the Life, but diſcovers that ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mien which makes his Enemies tremble at
the Head of his Armies, without loſing the
leaſt Grace of that mild and ſweet Air
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51877:23"/>
which charms his Subjects: And beſides it
ſeems to expreſs that vaſt and piercing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was never guilty of an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
and that Piety which excites him to
leave nothing unattempted for the Defence of
Religion.</p>
            <p>The ſame Miniſter repair'd the Royal Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of S. <hi>Germain en Laye, Fontainbleau</hi> and
<hi>Chambord.</hi> He caus'd four additional Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to be join'd to the firſt, which make that
Houſe a great deal more convenient than
'twas formerly: and he made uſe of Sir <hi>S.
Moreland</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mathematician, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh
it with Water-Spouts of ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a height, that the chief of 'em is above 30.
foot higher than the Dome that contains the
Bell. As for <hi>Verſailles</hi> it may be ſaid that he
rais'd it from the ground, as it were by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment:
'Twas formerly a Dog-kennel,
where <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. kept his Hunting-furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and at preſent 'tis a Palace worthy of
the great Monarch that lives in't. A long
Avenue of four Rows of Trees leads to it,
on the right hand of which is the Caſtle of
<hi>Clagny,</hi> which his Majeſty built for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
of <hi>Monteſpan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis ſeated near the ancient Barony of <hi>Clag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
at the ſide of a little and very old Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Beauty of which engag'd the King
in this vaſt and chargeable Deſign. The Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of this Caſtle is almoſt the ſame with
that of <hi>Verſailles;</hi> the Body of the Building
has no ſeparate Parts, but conſiſts of a ſingle
Piece, with two double turning Wings, under
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51877:24"/>
which there are two other ſingle oblique
Wings on the Fore-Front. The Court is 30.
<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Toiſe</hi> commonly contains ſix Feet.</note> 
               <hi>Toiſes</hi> broad, and 32. deep, without reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Half-Moon which encloſes it before,
and increaſes its Largeneſs. You aſcend to
the lower Story by five ſquare Steps, which
raiſe the Story between four and five Foot
high. Here there is a large Gallery 35. Toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
long, and 25. Foot broad, compos'd of
three Halls, ſomewhat broader than the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
left between 'em. The Hiſtory of <hi>Aeneas</hi>
is deſcrib'd in ſeveral Pictures on the Vault,
and above the Cornice that ſupports the
Frames, there are ſome Complications of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
in <hi>Baſſo relievo,</hi> repreſenting ſeveral <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
the <hi>Elements, Seaſons,</hi> and <hi>Parts of the
Earth,</hi> with their reſpective Qualities. The
Vault of the great Hall in the middle, which
is higher than the reſt, is born by four <hi>Tromps:</hi>
At the End of the Gallery you deſcend ſome
Steps to an Orange-Houſe pav'd with Marble,
24. Toiſes long, and 25. broad. The Chapel
is at the other Corner on the right hand; its
Ground-plot is round, and 30. Foot in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.
The great Stair-Caſe is in the right
wing at the Entry; 'tis of an unuſual Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
and the Stones are very ingeniouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpos'd:
it leads to a Porch join'd to the great
Hall that ſeparates two Apartments contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to two ſmaller ones; from whence in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
or rail'd Places, Maſs may be heard in
the Chapel. <hi>Manſard</hi> was the Deſigner and
Architect of this Building. The great Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
or Apartment in the Middle, is cover'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51877:24"/>
with a Dome; the Ground-plot is ſquare,
and the reſt of the Caſtle is cover'd with parted
Roofs or Timber-work, after the Faſhion
introduc'd by <hi>Manſard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The principal Ornaments of the Garden
are a Wood of high Trees, ſeveral <hi>Parterres</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
with Box into various Figures,
Bowling-Greens of ſeveral Figures, Groves
and Arbors of Lattice-Work embelliſh'd with
Architecture. There are alſo very fair Hedge-Rows
of <hi>Myrtles,</hi> which are full enough to
contain Cheſts full of Orange-Trees, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Shrubs, which ſeem to grow out of the
Hedge-Rows, for the Cheſts are not ſeen.
The Pond call'd <hi>de Clagny</hi> ſerves alſo for a
Canal in ſight of the Caſtle. The Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with which <hi>Colbert</hi> beautify'd this
Houſe, are not at all comparable to thoſe
with which he embelliſh'd <hi>Verſailles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Avenue terminates in a ſpacious
Plot of Ground that contains 180. <hi>Toiſes</hi> in
Front, and two other Avenues, which end in
the ſame Place, form a kind of Figure reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
a Gooſe's Foot. Here are the Great
and Little Stables, where all the Officers have
their Lodgings, and theſe Buildings are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the Caſtle by the above-mention'd
void Place.</p>
            <p>Each of the Stables conſiſts of five Courts,
the greateſt of which is narroweſt at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
being only enclos'd before by a Rail 32.
<hi>Toiſes</hi> in Length, and the Pavilions or additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Buildings of 9. <hi>Toiſes,</hi> which flank the
Wings that are 37. <hi>Toiſes</hi> long, and return to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Bottom of the Court, ending in a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51877:25"/>
Half-Moon made by two Arches of a Circle,
which join a large outer Building in which is
the Principal Gate. The two middle Courts are
ſurrounded with Buildings 20 <hi>Toiſes</hi> long, and
12. broad. On each ſide without is a little
Court for the Dung-hills, containing 20. <hi>Toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
in Length, and 9. in Breadth, enclos'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by a Partition-wall equal in Heigth to the
firſt Story. Theſe Buildings are contriv'd ſo
low, as not to obſtruct the Sight of the Caſtle;
for the Level of the Tops anſwers within a
little to the Marble Pavement of the little
Court. From the great Arch at the Bottom
of the little Court, and in the Middle of the
outward Court, you enter into a large co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<hi>Manage 20 Toiſes</hi> long, and 8 broad, at
the ſides of which are two Stables. Behind
the Stable there is a great <hi>Manage</hi> for <hi>Juſts</hi> and
<hi>Turnaments,</hi> before which is the <hi>Dog-Kennel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the little Stables, the Coach-Houſes
are under the Arches of the Half-moon, at
the Bottom of the Court: From the Gate of
the Front-Building you enter into the largeſt
Stable between two Ranks of Horſes, 25. in
each; and at the End there is a large Cop or
Spherical Vault, containing 12. <hi>Toiſes</hi> in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
which ſeparates the two other Stables.
There is an Entrance into the <hi>Dog-Kennel</hi> on
each ſide, where there is a Garden rail'd in
with Baliſters, that takes up all the Front of
the Building. This Structure is compos'd of a
Story next the Ground, and another above
that, without any apparent Roof. The great
Court is oblique, and the Paſſage to it lies
thro' two other ſmaller Courts. A Draw-bridge
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51877:25"/>
leads into a large outward Court, more
long than broad, ſurrounded with Iron Rails,
with two Apartments one on each ſide, to
which you aſcend by two Stair-Caſes of Brick
very large and uncover'd. Here the Cooks,
the Officers of the Buttery, Pantry, Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and ſeveral other of his Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
have their Lodgings. At the other End
of the outward Court are two great Arch'd
Gates, one on each ſide, which open into the
Town overagainſt the Church and Market-Place.
From this Court you paſs into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſquare Court, pav'd with black and
white Marble, with Fillets of another ſort of
white and red Marble: in the Midſt of this
Court there is a Vaſe of white Marble, with
a <hi>Groupe</hi> or Complication of Figures of Braſs,
gilt. The Building conſiſts of two Sides, and
two Wings, which look into the Garden:
The Chapel is on the right hand towards the
King's Apartment, and all the Miniſters are
lodg'd below, on the two Sides.</p>
            <p>The Stair-Caſe that leads to the King's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment
is a Maſter-Piece of Architecture.
'Tis 11. <hi>Toiſes</hi> long, and 5. broad, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
the lower Steps, and thoſe between
the Stories or Reſting-places. Three Arches
in Front open an Entry into a Porch 39 Foot
broad and 13 deep, which below is adorn'd
with Compartments of Marble. On the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part of the Stair and the Vault, there are
Ornaments and Trophies in <hi>Baſſo relievo;</hi>
from hence you aſcend by three Steps, and
three oppoſite Arches, to the firſt Landing-place
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51877:26"/>
or broad Step, containing 15 Foot in
Breadth, which is likewiſe overcaſt with
Compartments of Marble. Facing theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
there is a Stair-Caſe in Pannels of eleven
Steps of Marble: The broad, or Reſting-place
above is of eleven Steps ſquare. In the Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Wall there is a flat Nich, and in
it a Marble Vaſe ſupported by two Dolphins
of Braſs: two <hi>Tritons</hi> which are above bear a
double Scallop or Shell of Marble, adorn'd
with a Head ſpouting Water into a Panier or
Basket full of Shells, which forms a Nape
that falls into the Marble Vaſe, and runs thro'
another Head, and thro' the two Dolphins.
The whole is of Braſs.</p>
            <p>The Spaces between the Stories or Landing-places,
are ten Foot broad, and conſiſt each
of twenty Marble Steps. The Buttreſſes are
of the ſame Matter, ſupported by Baliſters of
Braſs, cut into Flowers and gilt. The two
Reſting-places are alſo overlaid with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments
of Marble, and ten Foot broad;
on each of which are four Doors richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with Sculpture, that lead into the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments.
On the ſame Reſting-places there
are Marble Columns and Pilaſters of the <hi>Ionic</hi>
Order, with Baſes and Chapitres of Braſs,
gilt. The Buſt of the King is plac'd againſt
the Wall, and accompany'd with ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of the ſame Matter.</p>
            <p>The four maſſive or ſolid Places at the ſides
of the four Doors of the Apartments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Pilaſters, are full of Ornaments
and Figures on a Ground of Gold, reſembling
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51877:26"/>
Tapeſtry. In the four middle Spaces there
are ſeveral Pictures repreſenting his Majeſty's
Conqueſts. In the Intervals between the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives
and middle Spaces there are Galleries on
each ſide of the ſame <hi>Ionic</hi> Order, and after
the ſame Model, Pillars on which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
Perſons of ſeveral Nations, as if
they were going into the Galleries. There
are alſo Galleries above the firſt Corniſh, and
two more in the length of the Faces ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Terms.</hi> On the Angles and at the End
are large Sterns of Ships, bearing four Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
of Arms like to thoſe of the four Parts
of the World. Theſe Sterns are ſupported
with Brackets in the Form of arch'd Buttreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
fortify'd with Horns of Plenty, and
Scallops of Braſs, at the Sides of which are
Captives in Sculpture, and underneath Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
            <p>The Cieling is adorn'd with octangular <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Relievo's</hi> full of Figures ſuitable to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
and the antique Pieces are cover'd with
large Curtains, the ſtrings of which are held
by <hi>Terms.</hi> In this Stair-caſe they have alſo
found room to place all the Muſes, the Arts
of Painting and Sculpture, Captives, the four
parts of the World with their ſeveral Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
all the Kings Actions, Poeſie, Hiſtory,
Fame, and Mercury. All theſe Ornaments
repreſent a Feſtival ſolemniz'd by the Deities
of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> who are met together to receive
the King at his return from the War. 'Tis
ſuppos'd that the Painting is the Work of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's
who appear in the Air adorning the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51877:27"/>
Vault and all the reſt of this magnificent place
with Feſtoons. His Majeſty is plac'd in the
middle, to denote that the Feſtival is kept for
him: and the People of all Nations who ſeem
to paſs into the Galleries, being variouſly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
according to the faſhion of their ſeveral
Countries, take a view of all theſe Wonders,
according to their reſpective Characters in
their paſſage to ſee that great Prince whoſe
Reputation has charm'd 'em. All the Pictures
are by the hand of <hi>Le Brun,</hi> and the Deſign
of the Stair-caſe by <hi>Manſard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Great Hall leads into the Gallery which
is 40 Toiſes long, and 36 Foot broad: here
the Hiſtory of the King is painted from the
Peace of the <hi>Pyrenees</hi> to that of <hi>Nimeghen,</hi>
where all his Majeſties Actions are repreſented
under Allegorical Figures, by the hand of <hi>Le
Brun.</hi> Eight Niches in the Gallery contain
the Antique Figures of <hi>Apollo, Venus</hi> of <hi>Savona,
Diana</hi> of <hi>Epheſus, Venus</hi> of <hi>Arles, Bacchus, Sleep,</hi>
and two Senatours. The three firſt were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
by <hi>Girardin,</hi> who alſo fitted Draperies
of Braſs gilt after the manner of Buſts, to
twelve Heads of Porphyry that repreſent the
<hi>Twelve Caeſars,</hi> and to four others of Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
or Jett, which are the Heads of Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men. <hi>Colbert</hi> took care not only of the
Building of this Gallery, but of all its Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Furniture; as Veſſels, Boxes of
Orange-Trees, Ciſterns, Rows of Stands for
Tapers, Silver Stands garniſh'd with Branches
and Candle-ſticks of the ſame Metal, Veſſels
of Porphyry plac'd above and under Tables
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51877:27"/>
full of precious Stones, which are multiplied
by the Glaſſes that ſurround the Place. And
he caus'd all thoſe Pieces of Silver-Work to
be wrought and carv'd with inconceivable
Care and Exactneſs.</p>
            <p>From this Gallery, the Way to the King's
Apartment, lies through the Hall of <hi>Mars,</hi>
which is full of Pictures, repreſenting Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
and Sieges of Towns under Allegorical
Figures. The Apartment contains a long Row
of Pieces, and in the firſt Place the Throne,
which is Silver, and eight Foot high. The
Seat and Back are ſupported by Children
carrying Baskets of Flowers: and on the
higheſt Part of the Seat which forms the
Back, ſtands <hi>Apollo</hi> holding his Lyre, and
crown'd with Laurel. On each ſide are <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi>
and <hi>Strength</hi> ſitting, and below two Silver
Stools with Cuſhions: at the two Angles are
Stands for Tapers eight Foot high; and four
branch'd Candle-ſticks ſupported by Silver
Stands ſix Foot high adorn the four Corners
of the Room. The next Chamber is that of
<hi>Mercury,</hi> then thoſe of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> and
the Halls of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Abundance.</hi> The laſt
leads into the Cabinet of Knacks or little Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities,
ſo call<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d becauſe 'tis full of 'em:
'tis of an octangular Figure, with Niches in
the Angles; the Vault is fram'd Dome-wiſe,
and the Light is in the Middle. All the
Work in this Cabinet is of Sculpture, of
which a great part is of Braſs gilt: 'tis ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with Glaſſes, and there are Degrees
in the Niches before the Glaſſes. The reſt of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51877:28"/>
the Cabinet is full of Brackets, which as well
as the degrees in the Niches are full of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities;
as Agats of all ſorts, and fram'd into
a thouſand different Figures; Cryſtals of great
value for the Faſhion in which they are cut;
little antique Figures of Braſs, Figures of Gold
cover'd with Jewels, and a great number of
curious works and precious Stones of ſeveral Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
There is a very fine Ship of Gold (for a
device to cover the King's Meat) on the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and a large and rich Cheſt of Drawers
in the Middle, full of an infinite number of
ancient and modern Medals. There is alſo
a Table eight Foot and a half long, and two
and a half broad; the Ground is of White
Marble, on which there is a Map of <hi>France,</hi>
compos'd of inlaid Pieces of Marble, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the exacteſt and lateſt Aſtronomical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.
Each Province is diſtinguiſh'd by
a Piece of Marble of a peculiar Colour, and
cut exactly according to the irregular Figure,
which the Frontiers of the Provinces make by
entering into one another. The Names of
the Provinces are mark'd in Capital Letters of
Gold, and thoſe of the Principal Towns in
<hi>Italick</hi> Characters. The moſt contrary Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
are plac'd next each other, to heighten
their Luſtre: thus the Iſle of <hi>France</hi> is of a
clear blue, <hi>Champaigne</hi> of red Porphyry, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leanois</hi>
of Opal, and <hi>Beauce</hi> of a <hi>Fueille-mort</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
But the Curiouſneſs of the Workman
appears particularly in the Interſections which
the Earth makes with the Sea, where all the
Capes and Bays are obſerv'd with an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51877:28"/>
Exactneſs; and in the Lakes and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
that are preſerv'd out of the Ground of
the Table, notwithſtanding the Smallneſs of
the Lines which frequently exceed not the
breadth of a Thread near the beginning of
the Rivers, and their winding Courſe. In the
Space of white Marble that denotes the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,</hi>
there is a Mariner's Compaſs of
different Pieces of Marble curiouſly wrought;
and in the other Space that ſtands for the <hi>Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
there are two Cartridges, in one of which
is written <hi>Carte de la France,</hi> with thoſe words
borrow'd from <hi>Virgil,</hi> which make a kind of
Deviſe of which <hi>France</hi> is the Body: <hi>Has tibi
exerit Artes:</hi> The other Cartridge contains
the Name of the Perſon who gave this Map
to the King. The Ocean is bounded on the
North with the neareſt Parts of the Coaſt of
<hi>England.</hi> The Border is compos'd of two
Fillets of blue Marble (one of which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
with a Moulding or Edging) and
one of black mark'd with the Degrees of
Longitude and Latitude by little oblong
Squares of white Marble, preſerv'd out of the
Ground of the Table.</p>
            <p>Above the King's Apartment is that call'd
the <hi>Marble Apartment,</hi> which is furniſh'd with
Ornaments, and embelliſh'd with ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
all of precious Marble. At the End
of this is the <hi>Cabinet of Baths,</hi> where nothing
appears but Gold, Marble, and very fine Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
with all the Ornaments and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
ſuitable to ſuch a Place. The <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s
Apartment is on the left hand, oppoſite to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51877:29"/>
the King's, and compos'd of a like number
of Chambers, which are all lin'd and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt
with the ſame ſorts of Marble, but vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
join'd and inlaid. The Cabinet of
Knacks, or little Curioſities, that belongs to
this Apartment, contains three Rooms and a
Half-Room, and the Floor is inlaid. The
Painting of the Cieling is by <hi>Mignard;</hi>
and there is ſuch a prodigious number of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
in this Place, that the aſtoniſh'd Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
can hardly forbear concluding, that all
the Kingdoms of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> were drain'd to
adorn it. The Porch that fronts the Middle of
the little Court, leads into the Park; and paſſing
under vaulted Galleries you come to the great
<hi>Terraſs</hi> at the Entry of the Garden. And here
it was that <hi>Colbert</hi> diſplay'd and even exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the moſt pleaſant and magnificent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
both of Nature and Art.</p>
            <p>The vaſt Extent of this ſtately Edifice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the Front and returning Wing
on that ſide alone which faces the Garden,
contains above three hundred <hi>Toiſes,</hi> and more
than four hundred and twenty large croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd
Windows, twenty outer Buildings,
with Columns ſurmounted with Figures, and
over theſe, Trophies intermixt with Veſſels
plac'd along the Baliſters that ſurround the
whole Structure. The Figures that adorn the
ſide which faces the Garden, are <hi>Apollo</hi> and
<hi>Diana,</hi> the four Seaſons, and twelve Months
of the Year; along the Gallery there are
twelve Figures of Rivers, and Nymphs of
Fountains; the Nymph <hi>Echo, Narciſſus, Thetis,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:51877:29"/>
and <hi>Galataea,</hi> with <hi>Hebe</hi> and <hi>Ganymede</hi> in two
Niches: on the Front of the King's great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
on that ſide where the <hi>Grotto</hi> was
formerly, which faces the Northern <hi>Parterre,</hi>
are <hi>Pomona, Vertumnus,</hi> one of the Nymphs
<hi>Heſperides,</hi> the Nymph <hi>Amalthaea, Thalia,
Momus, Terpſichore, Pan, Flora, Zephyrus, Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthus,
Clitia,</hi> and (in two Niches) <hi>Muſick</hi>
and <hi>Dancing.</hi> Theſe Figures are on the Wing
that belongs to the <hi>Dauphin:</hi> and that call'd
the Prince's Wing is adorn'd with <hi>Deities</hi> and
the <hi>Virtues,</hi> which are very numerous by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Length of that Wing, over-againſt
which there is another built ſince the Death
of <hi>Colbert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Piece that ſalutes thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
from the <hi>Terraſs,</hi> is the Vaſe of <hi>Latona,</hi>
in the midſt of which that Goddeſs is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
with her Children <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana:</hi>
the Peaſants metamorphos'd into Frogs are to
be ſeen in ſeveral Parts of the Vaſe, and the
Borders of it are adorn'd with ſeveral Figures
of thoſe Animals. In the Northern <hi>Parterre</hi>
before the <hi>Terraſs</hi> are two Vaſes with <hi>Tritons</hi>
and <hi>Syrens</hi> ſupporting rich Crowns, and ſpout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Water; and at the End of it there is a
long Alley that leads to the Canal, fenc'd on
both ſides with Hedge-Rows, along which
there are ſeveral Figures repreſenting the four
Seaſons, four Parts of the World, four Ages,
four kinds of Poeſie, four Parts of Day and
Night, and the four Elements. All theſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
were deſign'd by <hi>le Brun,</hi> and made
after his Models.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:51877:30"/>
There is another Alley, call'd the <hi>Water,</hi>
or <hi>Caſcade-Alley;</hi> in the middle of which
there is another form'd by two Ranks of
complicated Figures, repreſenting <hi>Cupids,</hi>
young Boys and Girls, little <hi>Tritons,</hi> and
Terms, which are half-body'd Figures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Arms: Some of theſe carry on their
Heads great Shells, in form of Baſons, fill'd
with Coral. and various kinds of Shells; and
others bear Baskets full of Flowers, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſorts of Fruit. The Water that flows
out of theſe Baskets and Baſons in form of
a <hi>Nape</hi> or Table-Cloath, gave this Walk the
Name by which 'tis uſually known. At
the end of this Alley, you enter into that
of the <hi>Pyramide;</hi> the Fountain (ſo call'd) is
compos'd of four Baſons of white Marble,
one above another, and decreaſing gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
according to their height. The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
twelve Feet in Diameter, and a Top
or Cover of one Piece of Marble, being
ſupported by four <hi>Tritons</hi> greater than the
Life; and the reſt differ only in the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Figures and Veſſels. The whole
Work is of white Marble, ſaving only the
Pedeſtals, which are of coloured Marble:
The Figures and Ornaments are of Braſs;
and altogether make a Water-work reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
a Table-cloth, thro' which the Figures
appear. The Water is receiv'd below in a
great ſquare Baſon, adorn'd with a <hi>Baſſo-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievo</hi>
of eight or ten Nymphs bathing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who may be ſeen thro' the Water
that covers 'em in the form of a Table-cloth:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51877:30"/>
And beſides, there are other <hi>Baſſo-relievo</hi>'s,
repreſenting Rivers, Nymphs, and Children,
all as big as the Life, and made by <hi>Girardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On both ſides of the Great Alley there
are <hi>Groves,</hi> encloſed with Lattice-Work,
which are diſtinguiſh'd by peculiar Names.
The firſt that appears on the Right-hand is
the <hi>Triumphal-Arch,</hi> ſo call'd from the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of one at the bottom: It contains
three Portico's, with ſeven Baſons above 'em,
out of which ariſe as many Water-ſpouts
that fall back into the ſame Baſons, and
from thence into ſeveral others on both ſides,
forming divers <hi>Napes,</hi> or Figures of a Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth:
And in the midſt of the Portico's
three Water-Spouts ariſe out of high Baſons,
and make the ſame ſort of Water-works.
You aſcend to the Portico's by ſeveral Steps,
which are alſo full of Water-Spouts that fall
into a great Baſon below. On both ſides of
the <hi>Triumphal-Arch</hi> there are two Obelisks
between as many Scabelons or Pedeſtals
fram<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d like Stools, on which there are Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that ſpout forth Water. Returning
from thence, you meet with two high Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids,
conſiſting of ſeveral Steps or Degrees,
and throwing up Water in a ſquare Figure,
which is divided into ſeveral Spouts. On
both ſides of theſe Pyramids are two other
Pedeſtals or Stools, with Baſons and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Spouts:
And beſides, there are two Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisks,
one on each ſide, between two Scabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,
with Ornaments, Baſons, and Water-Spouts,
like the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:51877:31"/>
The Fourth Front which faces the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal-Arch</hi>
is beautifi'd with a great number
of Ornaments, tho' part of it is taken up
with the Entrance into that place: For on
both ſides there are Pedeſtals, with Baſons,
Caſcades, and Figures repreſenting the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of <hi>France;</hi> and the part that remains
empty is fill'd with Water, which mounting
up into thoſe void Spaces, makes 'em appear
like ſo many Works of Cryſtal, enrich'd
with many Ornaments, where Gold is not
ſpar'd. The whole was deſign'd by <hi>le
Noſtre,</hi> Intendant of the Garden of the <hi>Tuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In your paſſage from the <hi>Triumphal-Arch</hi>
to the <hi>Theatre of Water,</hi> you meet, in the
firſt place, with the <hi>Fountain of the Dragon,</hi>
in the midſt of which there is a Dragon of
Braſs, that ſpouts Water from ſeveral parts
of his Body; and then with the <hi>Baſon of
Neptune,</hi> in which the Figure of that Deity
is plac'd, with all its Attributes or Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The <hi>Theatre of Water</hi> derives its Name
from the various Figures repreſented by the
Water-Spouts, of which 'tis full. Firſt you
perceive three Alleys of Water, in form of
a Gooſe-Paw, border'd with a Trellis; they
are on a riſing Ground, and higher than
the part where you ſtand to view 'em.
The middle Alley is divided on each ſide
from the other two, by a hollow place en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd,
and ſurrounded with a Trellis; and
before theſe Encloſures, there are two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
containing other ſmaller and higher
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51877:31"/>
Baſons, diſpoſed in ſuch a manner, that
the Water-Spouts which riſe up from 'em,
fall down again, and filling all the Baſons,
makes <hi>Napes</hi> of Water all around. There
are like Works beyond the other two Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
ſo that each Alley has ſome of 'em
on both ſides. The middle Alley is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the reſt, containing Caſcades that
make fourteen or fifteen <hi>Napes</hi> of Water
one above another: And both the Caſcades
and Water-works are form'd by a great
number of Water-Spouts, which running
in five Rows along the whole Alley, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
it into ſix little Alleys. At the end
of it is a large Baſon, which takes up the
whole Front of the Caſcades, and receives
their Water; and below that another Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
fill'd by ſix great Water-Spouts. The
other two Alleys have each two Rows of
Water-Spouts, which divide 'em into three
Parts, or ſmall Alleys. They are in a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which is continu'd from one end of
the Alleys to the other: And ſince their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
is ſloping, by ſtopping the Courſe
of the Water in ſeveral places, there are
Water-Works in form of a Table-Cloth,
and Caſcades form'd along the Alleys that
accompany thoſe of the middle Alley. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Trelliſes and the Water-Spouts of
all the Three Alleys, there are ſix Rows of
ſmall Trees, variouſly cut, and repreſenting
ſeveral Figures: And ſince the Deſign of
the Contrivers was to imitate the Embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments
of Theatres; theſe Water-Spouts
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51877:32"/>
undergo five ſeveral Changes; for they
mount up ſtreight at firſt, afterwards they
bend into crooked Figures, and form Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
on the In-ſide, and then behind, and
at laſt they form Circles before, which
changing on a ſudden, appear behind.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marſh of Water</hi> is an oblong Square,
eight Toiſes broad, and twelve long: In
the middle there is a great Oak-Tree, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd
with the Repreſentations of all
the uſual Productions of Fenny-Grounds;
and the Banks are full of Reeds, among
which there are Swans in the Corners. All
the Branches of the Oak, the Herbs that
ſurround it, with the Reeds and Swans caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth Water together, give the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
the pleaſure of ſeeing a Million of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Spouts
at the ſame time, ſome higher,
and others lower, which form as it were a
Field of Water, and waſhing the Plants,
make their greenneſs appear more natural.
About the midſt of the two Wings of the
Mariſh, in two hollow places, there are two
Marble Tables rais'd on ſome Steps, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with all the Furniture of a Cupboard:
But ſince the greateſt part of theſe Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have only Circles, or other Pieces
gilt, the uſe of 'em does not appear, 'till
the Water begins to play. The Situation
of this Grove is low, and the riſing Grounds
that ſurround it are adorn'd with Veſſels
of Porcelain, on ſeveral ſorts of Pedeſtals
before the Trelliſes, which make a very fine
and Pleaſant ſight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:51877:32"/>
In the ſame part of the Garden there are
two Baſons which are not enclos'd; one is
call'd the <hi>Fountain of Ceres,</hi> and the other has
its Name from <hi>Flora.</hi> Theſe Baſons, with
thoſe of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> which are on
the other ſide, are call'd the <hi>Fountains of the
Four Seaſons. Ceres</hi> with her Sickle appears
in the midſt of a Hexagonal Baſon, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with Ears of Corn gilt. <hi>Flora</hi> is
in a leaning Poſture, environ'd with eight
large Water-Spouts, and ſeveral other ſmall
ones, in form of a Heron's Tuft.</p>
            <p>The Grove of the <hi>Mountain of Water,</hi> or of
the <hi>Star,</hi> takes its Name from the Five Walks
that repreſent a Star, meeting near the
principal Fountain. The Water-Spouts that
iſſue out of the Rock on both ſides of the
Alleys, fall into a little Ditch in form of a
Shower, in the midſt of which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Fountain ſurrounded with a Trellis,
adorn'd with Architecture and Pilaſters:
And about it there are hollow parts, enclos'd
after the manner of Portico's, and contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Barriers that keep the ſame Figure. The
Top of the Trelliſes is adorn'd with Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of ſeveral Figures, full of Flowers and
green Herbs. The Water-Spouts of the
chief Baſon are unequal, and form a kind
of <hi>Mountain of Water,</hi> from the top of which
iſſues a large Water-Spout.</p>
            <p>At the two ends of the Grove of <hi>Apollo's
Baths,</hi> there are two ſquare Pavilions, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rich and handſom, invented by <hi>Manſard,</hi>
each of 'em containing eight Pannels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51877:33"/>
fourteen and fifteen Foot broad, and
twenty foot high. They are of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
each being adorn'd with eight Columns
of colour'd Marble, and Pilaſters cut out of
the white Marble. The Aſcents of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Pannels or Pieces in the Corners are
full of Trophies of Braſs, repreſenting the
Arms us'd by ſeveral Nations: And there
are alſo like Trophies on the out-ſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Pilaſters. The Domes are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd
with ſeveral Metallic Ornaments,
and end in a Veſſel. Over-againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the Grove, in the midſt of the two
ſides, are the fine Marble Figures, made by
<hi>Girardon,</hi> repreſenting the <hi>Sun</hi> with <hi>Thetis,</hi>
and her Nymphs waſhing his Feet, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Water upon him, and wiping him:
And in the hollow parts of the ſides, there
are complicated Figures of <hi>Tritons</hi> holding
<hi>Apollo</hi>'s Horſes. This Grove is ſurrounded
with a Terraſs, adorn'd with Baliſters of
Braſs gilt: And the Arms us'd in Battle by
all the Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> are repreſented in
eighty two <hi>Baſſo-relievo's</hi> about the Terraſs.
In the middle of the Spot of Ground en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd
by the Terraſs, there is an octangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Baſon, ſurrounded with Baliſters of Braſs
gilt, of a different Deſign from thoſe of
the <hi>Terraſs:</hi> And every one of the Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals
that are ſcatter'd up and down in this
Place, ſpouts out Water, which makes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Ditch about the Baliſters, from whence
the Water ſpreading it's ſelf, forms a <hi>Nape.</hi>
There are alſo four large Pedeſtals adorn'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51877:33"/>
with Marble Figures: On the firſt is the
<hi>Break of Day,</hi> repreſented by a young Man
holding a Flambeau, with Clouds at his
Feet, an <hi>Owl</hi> flying away, and <hi>Zephyrus</hi>
blowing. The <hi>Morning</hi> is on the Second,
ſtrewing Flowers, and alighting from her
Chariot: On the Third <hi>Arion</hi> is repreſented,
invoking the Gods, and mounted on a Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin:
And on the Fourth <hi>Leucothoe,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Offerings from the Mariners.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of a Grove, adorn'd with Trel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis-Work,
there is a large Baſon, containing
<hi>Enceladus</hi> almoſt buried under the Rocks he
had pil'd up to ſcale Heaven. That which
appears of him is four times bigger than the
Life: He caſts out of his Mouth a Water-Spout
twenty four Foot high, and bigger
than a Man's Arm; and an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſmaller Streams guſh forth among
the Stones that over-whelm him. Beſides
theſe, ſeveral large Water-Spouts ariſe out
of twelve Heaps of Stones that lie at ſome
diſtance from the Giant, ſurrounding the
Baſon and Arbors of Trellis-Work: And on
a ſloping Graſs-Plot, there are divers little
Baſons of pieces of Rocks, in each of which
there is a Water-Spout.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hall of Feaſts,</hi> or of the <hi>Council,</hi> is
more long than broad; it has a Graſs-Plot
in the middle, ſurrounded with Gravel-Walks,
at the four Corners of which are round Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
jutting out over a Ditch full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that environs this Place. The Figure
of the Borders of the Ditch is odd but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51877:34"/>
for it comprehends in its Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
above thirty Angles, ſtretching outwards,
and as many bending inwards. Over-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the midſt of each ſide, there is a
Baſon without the Ditch, ſo that the Hall
ſeems encompaſs'd with Baſons, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
alſo thoſe in the Corners: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Water-Spouts in the Baſons, the
Ditch is full of 'em. Every Spout both in
the Ditch and Baſons, proceeds from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of gilt Figures of Children in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Poſtures. The Draw-Bridges by which
you enter into the Hall, are remov'd, and
drawn under-ground by a ſort of Spring,
ſo that you may be impriſon'd in it.</p>
            <p>Between this Grove and the <hi>Colomnade,</hi>
you meet on the out-ſide with the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> oppoſite to thoſe
of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Flora. Saturn</hi> is in a round Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
accompany'd with ſeveral Children,
carrying the old Man's Properties, which
caſt forth many Water-Spouts. He holds a
Stone preſented to him by his Wife, who
makes him believe ſhe was brought to Bed
of it: This Baſon repreſents <hi>Winter.</hi> That
of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which denotes <hi>Autumn,</hi> is of an
octangular Figure, where that Deity appears,
accompany'd with ſeveral Satyrs, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with all his Attributes; and all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
caſt forth ſeveral Water-Spouts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
there are four other Satyrs at an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
diſtance from him; and every one of
'em ſpouts out Water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:51877:34"/>
The <hi>Colomnade</hi> (or Range of Pillars) is
in the Place where the Springs were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
on an Aſcent which at preſent makes
a part of that Grove. The Encloſure is an
exact Square, twenty one <hi>Toiſes</hi> and a half
in Diameter, environ'd with thirty two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
of ſeveral kinds of Marble, of the
<hi>Ionic</hi> Order, twenty Inches about, and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Foot high, comprehending the <hi>Attic</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and the quadrangular Chapiters of white
Marble. Theſe Columns are accompany'd
with their Pilaſters, which ſtand by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
about two Diameters and a half di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from the Columns behind, they are
both crown'd with Entablatures, which are
only Cornices architrav'd, turning on each Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and leaning in form of a Plat-band on
the Pilaſters. The Columns and Pilaſters
are both plac'd on Marble <hi>Socles,</hi> ſomewhat
higher than they are broad; and the firſt
are join'd together by Arches, adorn'd with
their <hi>Archivoltes,</hi> with Heads in their Keys,
repreſenting the Rural and Marine Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as the <hi>Nymphs, Naiads, Dryads, Hama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dryads,
Sylvans, &amp;c.</hi> The whole is crown'd
with a <hi>Corinthian</hi> Cornice, which turning
into it-ſelf, makes a perfect Circle. Above
the Cornice is a <hi>Socle</hi> adorn'd with Gates
in <hi>Bas-relief;</hi> and the <hi>Socle</hi> turning round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
each Column, bears a Veſſel of white
Marble, carv'd, and ending in a Pine-Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The Triangular <hi>Tympans</hi> between the
Arches are adorn'd with thirty two <hi>Bas-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs</hi>
of Children, among whom the <hi>Sports</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:51877:35"/>
and <hi>Loves</hi> are repreſented. The whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
is plac'd in a round Baſon or Ditch
that runs quite round, and receives the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that falls in form of a Table-cloth from
thirty one Water-Spouts, in a like number of
Baſons of white Marble, each plac'd on a
Foot adorn'd with three Corbels. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
takes up the place of the thirty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Baſon, which ſtands before it in a
Nich of Trellis-Work, at the meeting of
the two Walks that lead to the place. The
<hi>Area</hi> in the middle is gravell'd, and ſhut
up with five Steps diſtant about thirteen or
fourteen foot from the ſide of the Ditch;
and that Interval forms another gravell'd
Walk. The whole Structure is built of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
white Marble without Incruſtation; the
Wood that ſurrounds it, and the Trellis-Work
which adorn the Twigs of the Trees,
make an excellent Ground for the more
diſtinct view of the Architecture; and this
piece which was only deſign'd for Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
is no leſs admir'd for the neatneſs
of the Work, than for the richneſs of the
Matter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Water-Gallery</hi> is full of Antick Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
that form its Wings, at the ſide of
which there are two Rows of Trees, ſo
cut as not to obſcure or hide the Figures.
The Statues at the two Ends are not at all
bigger than the Life; and the Trees are
ſucceeded by two Rows of Water-Spouts.
At each end of the Gallery there is a great
broad Baſon, into which the Water falls
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51877:35"/>
back; and the Ends jut out at the middle.
One of the Baſons contains three large Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Spouts,
and in the other a ſmall high-rais'd
Baſon, that forms a Water-Work in form of
a Table-Cloth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Royal Iſland</hi> is a large Canal, in the
midſt of which there is an Iſland eight Foot
deep, and one hundred and ſixty foot long;
and there is another leſs Canal at the end
of this. In the place call'd the <hi>Branch'd
Candleſtick,</hi> the Figure of the Water-Works
is exactly ſuitable to the Name.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hall of Balls</hi> is Hexagonal; four ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
Stairs of four Steps each, open a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to it, and 'tis ſurrounded with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Ditch full of Water of the ſame Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
The Banks of the Ditches are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Shells, and there are ſeveral Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of <hi>Porcelain</hi> round the third Encloſure
that encompaſſes the Hall. Over-againſt
the four <hi>Perrons,</hi> or advanc'd Stairs, there
are two Caſcades, and as many Entries:
There are alſo ſix Benches for Seats, and
this place is cover'd with a Trellis. Each of
the Caſcades conſiſts of ſeventeen Rows of
Baſons of Shell-Work, rais'd with ſeven Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
one above another; but five of the
Rows are compos'd of nine Baſons. The
tops of thoſe that have no Water-Spouts,
are adorn'd with Veſſels of Metal, four of
which repreſent the <hi>Bacchanalia</hi> on Sea and
Land: Theſe Repreſentations are very ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the deſign'd uſe of the place; for
the Dancing-Figures have ſo natural an Air,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51877:36"/>
that 'tis impoſſible to look on 'em without
feeling ſome Motions of Joy. Under each
Caſcade there are large Taper-Candleſticks
for the Conveniency of Illuminations in the
Evening, for the Glittering of the Water
contributes very much to pleaſe the Eye of
the Spectatour. The Sides of the two En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are adorn'd with Hatch'd-Work, and on
the top with Veſſels.</p>
            <p>The laſt, and one of the greateſt of theſe
Groves or little Woods, is the <hi>Labyrinth:</hi> it
contains thirty eight Fountains, contriv'd to
repreſent a like number of <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s <hi>Fables,</hi> and
embelliſh'd with many Water-Spouts. Every
Fountain has a Baſon, in which its proper Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is repreſented by Metallic Figures in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi>
with Characters declaring the Subject.
The Ornaments which reſemble thoſe of one
of the Arches enclos'd in the Hedge-Rows,
are half-cover'd and environ'd with Leaves
and Reeds ſpouting Water. The greateſt part
of 'em are of Tin or ſome other convenient
Matter, as well as the Branches thro' which
the Water paſſes; and painted green with ſo
natural a Verdure, that they ſeem to be re-really
what they repreſent, till the ſpurting of
the Water undeceives the Spectatour. The
Name of this Place is a ſufficient Indication
that 'tis full of Windings, and variouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingl'd
Walks, which are ſo intricate,
that thoſe who are engag'd in 'em cannot
without ſome difficulty avoid returning to the
ſame Parts they had already viſited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:51877:36"/>
The <hi>Orange-houſe</hi> is one of the fineſt Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Verſailles:</hi> It was deſign'd by <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard,</hi>
and is ſo large and bold a Structure, that
the World cannot produce a more finiſh'd
Work of that Kind. On the left hand 'tis
expos'd to the South, and ſupports the Earth
that encloſes a large <hi>Parterre,</hi> which fronts the
lateral Face of the Caſtle, and that of the
great Iſle or Wing. This Building conſiſts of
a large Gallery 80. <hi>Toiſes</hi> long, accompany'd
by two others turning inwards of 60. <hi>Toiſes</hi>
each: the Breadth of theſe Galleries on the
North-ſide of the Wall amounts to 38. Feet,
and their Height to the Scutheon or Key, to
ſeven <hi>Toiſes.</hi> The Vault is divided into as
many Parts as there are Croſs-works by
Branches Ogiv'd or Semi-circular Arches, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by little Buttreſſes that jut out the
length of a Foot: and the lateral Galleries
communicate with that at the End or Bottom
of the Building, by two round Towers or
Segments of a Circle jutting outwards, and
of equal Breadth within to that of the Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
On the Side next the great Iſle, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Wall at the inward Angle is adorn'd
with two large Niches; and in the ſame
place, at the other End, there are two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
with advanc'd Stairs that lead into a
Hall or round Porch, which is the principal
Entry into the <hi>Orange-houſe</hi> from the Park.
Beſides thoſe Niches there is one in the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the main Gallery over-againſt the great
Door; it contains a Statue of the King on Foot
of white Marble, which was preſented to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51877:37"/>
his Majeſty by the late Duke <hi>de la Feüillade,</hi>
who had caus'd it to be made with a Deſign
to erect it in the <hi>Place of Victories,</hi> in the room
of that which is there at preſent. Theſe
Niches are large enough to contain complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Figures of <hi>Coloſſes,</hi> ſuch as thoſe of the
<hi>Baths</hi> of <hi>Thetis</hi> and <hi>Caracalla,</hi> where the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Flora</hi> ſtood. The largeſt
Gallery receives Light thro' thirteen Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
taken out of the Arches: the Inſide is
not adorn'd either with Architecture or Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
as the Rules of that kind of Building
require: its main Beauty conſiſting in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Contrivance of the Vault. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Decoration conſiſts only of Boſſages of
the Heighth of one Module, or half the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the Columns which are of the <hi>Tuſcan</hi>
Order, containing four Feet and two Inches
in Diameter, and their Thickneſs being the
ſeventh part of their Heighth. There are
but two outward or Front-Buildings, of
which that in the Middle conſiſts of eight
Columns coupl'd together, and the other two
of four Columns each: and there are alſo
two Columns at the Royal Door of the
Hall or Entry; being of the ſame Order,
but of a leſs Diameter. Theſe Columns are
crown'd with a regular Entablature, and the
Front-Buildings on the ſides are contiguous to
that part of the Level of the <hi>Terraſs</hi> which
leans on the Vaults; ſo that by two large
Pair of Stairs, each ten <hi>Toiſes</hi> broad, you may
deſcend to the lower Part of the <hi>Orange-houſe.</hi>
The Steps are interrupted by two Landing-Places;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51877:37"/>
and there are low or creeping Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
under 'em to give light to the Vault. All
this great Theatre encloſes a <hi>Parterre</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments
of Turf adorn'd with a Baſon in
the Middle: the Fore-part of the <hi>Parterre</hi> is
rail'd in with Baliſters on a ſloping Wall,
that makes one of the Sides of a little Ditch
or Canal full of Water; the Counterſcarp is
much lower than the Wall, ſo that thoſe who
paſs by on the High-way have a full and very
pleaſant View of the Building. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Entries are equal in Breadth to the Edges,
and adorn'd with two great Jaums of a Wall,
each of which is beautify'd with two diſtinct
<hi>Tuſcan</hi> Columns coupl'd together, and crown'd
as well as the Columns with a regular Enta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blature.
The North part of the Jaums is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
above with Boſſages like to thoſe of the
<hi>Orange-houſe,</hi> and under the Columns is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of a Medley of Figures between the
Jaums, and from the hinder Part of 'em to
the Foot of the Stairs. The Space between
the Stairs and the principal Gates is inclos'd
with an Iron Grate, ſo that you may go up
to the <hi>Parterre</hi> above, without entering into
the <hi>Orange-houſe.</hi> Theſe Grates are kept firm
by Stone Pillars on which are plac'd Veſſels
full of Flowers and Fruits: the Gates are
crown'd with rich Iron-Work in two Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with the King's Arms; and all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of the Locks are gilded. The <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre</hi>
is divided into ſix large Squares with
Compartments of Turf, ſeparated by Gravel
of the ſame Heighth with the Walks: and in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51877:38"/>
the midſt of the Squares, next the middle
Gallery, there is a round Baſon or Fountain
border'd with Turf. In the Croſs-Walk that
ſeparates theſe four Pannels or Squares from
the other two, there is a great Complication
of Figures of white Marble on a Pedeſtal,
where <hi>Fame</hi> is repreſented writing the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the King. In her left hand ſhe holds
his Majeſty's Picture in <hi>Profile,</hi> in an Oval
Medal, which ſhe places on a Book denoting
<hi>Hiſtory:</hi> She is repreſented by a great wing'd
Figure, magnificently apparell'd, and ſeated
on Trophies: ſhe tramples on <hi>Envy,</hi> who
tears a Heart, and with her left hand pulls
<hi>Fame</hi> by the Gown, to hinder her from Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Among the Trophies there are Medals
with the Portraictures of the greateſt Princes,
ſuch as <hi>Alexander, Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Trajan.</hi> This
Maſs of Figures ſtands by it ſelf, and is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on all ſides, making a very fine and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sight: it was made at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Dominico
Guidi,</hi> of the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Urbin,</hi> one of the
moſt Famous Sculptors in <hi>Italy,</hi> and Diſciple
of <hi>Alexander Algondy,</hi> who was one of the
beſt Artiſts of his Age. In this <hi>Parterre</hi> the
Orange-Trees are plac'd, when the Seaſon of
the Year permits.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kitchin-Garden</hi> is without the Limits of
the Park that includes the <hi>Orange-houſe,</hi> being
ſituated on the Side next the great Wing of
the Caſtle and parallel to the <hi>Mall,</hi> from
which 'tis ſeparated by a large Baſon of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
'tis a quadrangular Encloſure a hundred
and fifty ſeven <hi>Toiſes</hi> long, and a hundred
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51877:38"/>
and thirty four broad, divided into thirty one
little Gardens ſeparated from each other, and
enclos'd with Walls; which communicating
together encompaſs a large Garden, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
100. <hi>Toiſes</hi> in Length, and 84. in Breadth,
with a round Fountain or Baſon of Water in
the Middle, of 20. <hi>Toiſes</hi> border'd with Turf.
The King enters into this Place by a Gate, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Royal Gate</hi> in the Walk parallel to the
<hi>Mall.</hi> The Body of the Edifice almoſt to the
corner of the Wall of the Encloſure, conſiſts
of two Sides or diſtinct Structures, join'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by two Galleries one above another, call'd
the <hi>Figuerie,</hi> which is 25. <hi>Toiſes</hi> long, and the
Garden uſually known by the Name of <hi>Melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere,</hi>
or Melon-Garden, is alſo very large. All
thoſe Gardens are appointed for Fruit-Trees,
and ſo artificially diſpos'd, that each Row of
Trees enjoys the Warmth of the Sun agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to their peculiar Natures, ſome more and
others leſs, ſome at one time of the day,
and ſome at another. Every Garden has alſo
the Conveniency of a Fountain to furniſh it
with Water, and of a <hi>Terraſs,</hi> under which are
vaulted Arbours that ſerve for Fruit-Houſes in
Winter. The Pond that ſeparates the <hi>Kitchin-Garden</hi>
from the <hi>Mall,</hi> was dug by <hi>Switzers,</hi>
from whom it took the Name that ſtill it
bears: 'tis very large and ought rather to be
call'd a Lake or great Pond, than a Fountain
or Baſon of Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colbert</hi> did not content himſelf with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhing
this Garden with all the Curioſities
that <hi>Europe</hi> could furniſh; he took care alſo
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51877:39"/>
to repleniſh the <hi>Menagerie</hi> or <hi>Vivarium</hi> with
the rareſt Animals that were to be found in the
Four Parts of the World. The great Canal
leads to that <hi>Rural Houſe</hi> on one ſide, and to
<hi>Trianon</hi> on the other: and tho' the former
is deſign'd only as a Lodge for Animals, as
its Name imports, it has the ſtately Aſpect
of a magnificent Palace, and preſents a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Proſpect of four Pavilions and a Dome
to the Eyes of the Beholder. The Paſſage
to it lies thro' a large Avenue or Walk of
Trees, and in the firſt Place brings you to a
Court enclos'd with Iron-Rails, from whence
you enter into another, at the oppoſite End
of which there is an octangular Dome, that
forms a Hall of the ſame Figure, whither
you aſcend by a few Steps to an Entry that
leads into the Hall that is ſurrounded with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Chambers. Beneath theſe there is a
<hi>Grotto</hi> with a wheeling Water-Spout in the
Middle that beſprinkles the whole <hi>Grotto;</hi>
and the Floor is full of little Holes, from
whence there ariſes a Shower of Water. The
Hall is environ'd with an octogonal Court,
ſurrounded with Iron Rails, in which you
meet with ſeven Iron Doors at a convenient
diſtance from each other, that open into a
like number of Courts, ſome of which are
appointed for Stables, ſome for Sheep-Houſes,
and others contain Stalls for ſeveral ſorts of
Animals. In one of theſe Courts there is a
very fine <hi>Bird-Houſe,</hi> for thoſe Birds that
muſt be kept in Cages or Coops; and a <hi>Fiſh-Pond</hi>
in another for the uſe of <hi>Pelicans,</hi> and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51877:39"/>
ſeveral other ſorts of Fowl that feed on Fiſhes.
On the right hand in places enclos'd with
Rails, ſuch Animals are kept that they may
be ſafely ſuffer'd to range about; for they
may eaſily paſs between the Rails: Here are
to be ſeen in different Lodges, <hi>Ermins, Civet-Cats,
Caſtors, Muſcovia-Cats</hi> and <hi>Rats,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary
Cats.</hi> The left ſide of the ſame Court is
appointed for wild and voracious Animals,
ſuch as <hi>Lyons, Tygres, Leopards, Lynxes, Bears,</hi>
and <hi>Wolves.</hi> Such Beaſts as are made uſe of
for Labour are lodg'd in another Court,
and next to that are <hi>Mews</hi> for all ſorts of
Fowls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trianon</hi> is ſeated on the other ſide of the
Canal. Before that fine and pleaſant Houſe
there is a Hollow or Bottom reſembling a
Half-Oval, with a Door on each Side, and
one at the End, oppoſite to the Entry, which
leads into the Principal Court, as thoſe on
each Side do into two other ſeparate Courts,
that reach along the Oval. At the End of
theſe two Courts, following the Oval, you
meet with two Doors that open into the
Court, at the oppoſite End of which is the
Principal Apartment conſiſting only of one
Story, and adorn'd on the outſide with ſo vaſt
number of Veſſels of ſeveral Figures repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<hi>Porcelane,</hi> that nothing elſe appears to
the Eye. The Inſide alſo is painted in Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Porcelane;</hi> the Walls are all cover'd with
Looking-Glaſſes, and the Furniture is equally
Rich and Genteel. The Sides of this Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are border'd with two Square Pavilions,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51877:40"/>
built and adorn'd after the ſame Faſhion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And there are two other Pavilions lower
down, which terminate the fore-part of the
Structure. This place was deſign'd for a
Magazine of all ſorts of Flowers, which are
preſerv'd here both in Winter and Summer.
All the Baſons either are, or appear to be
of Porcelain, and Water-Spouts ariſe out of
the Urns. The Flowers and Shrubs are kept
in Pots of Procelain, or in Boxes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
it; and there are long Walks of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range-Trees
planted in the Ground, with
Hedge-Rows of Jaſmins and Myrtles under
a Gallery of Timber that remains open du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Summer, but in Winter is cover'd
with Dung, to preſerve the Trees from the
Cold.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Colbert</hi> thought there were ſtill ſome
finiſhing Strokes wanting to compleat the
Beauty of <hi>Verſailles.</hi> There was no other
Water but what was pump'd out of a Pond,
and from thence diſtributed by Canals, to
the places that requir'd its Moiſture; nor
was it free from the uſual defects of ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
Water, Stench, and Muddineſs. The
Conſideration of theſe Inconveniences made
<hi>Colbert</hi> undertake to bring Water from the
River <hi>Eure</hi> to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> by an Aqueduct,
which reaches from the Hill of <hi>Picardon</hi> to
the Ciſterns or Reſervers of Water. Five
large Baſons contain both the Water of
that River, and that which ſupplies the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
of <hi>Marly:</hi> Four of 'em are oblong
Squares, eighty five <hi>Toiſes</hi> loing, and fifty four
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51877:40"/>
broad, with Pannels of eighteen <hi>Toiſes</hi> at
the outward Angles; and in the midſt of
theſe, there is a little Baſon of ten <hi>Toiſes</hi>
in Diameter, call'd the <hi>Receptacle of Water,</hi>
becauſe it receives all the Water, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes
it to the great Baſons at the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
which are hollow'd and fram'd into
Arches of a Circle. Theſe five Baſons are
ſeparated by Walks of eighteen Foot in
breadth, and ſurrounded with another of
eight <hi>Toiſes,</hi> which reaches from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Brink of the Baſons to the <hi>Glacis</hi> of
the Earth that is enclos'd with a Wall.
The great Baſons are eighteen Foot deep,
and fill'd with Water to the height of
twelve Feet; ſo that each of 'em contains
8000 Cubical <hi>Toiſes</hi> of Water, or 224000
<hi>Muids,</hi> amounting in all the four to 896000
<hi>Muids</hi> or Hogſheads of Water. To retain
the Water, there is a Lay of Clay eighteen
Inches thick, both at the Bottom, and
round the Edges of the Baſons or Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
ſupported by a Wall four Foot broad
above, and five below, founded on a Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Grate laid over the Clay with Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms;
'tis call'd <hi>The Wall of Douvre,</hi> and
the <hi>Talus</hi> or Sloping is on the inſide, by
which it loſes a Foot of its breadth. The
Aqueduct is 500 <hi>Toiſes</hi> long, and its greateſt
height amounts to fourteen or fifteen. The
<hi>Baſis</hi> or Ground-Work extends to fourteen
Feet, which are reduc'd to ſix on the top;
and of that number the Canal takes up
three, in which breadth it contains 648
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51877:41"/>
Inches of Water. The River <hi>Eure</hi> is brought
to <hi>Verſailles</hi> from <hi>Pontgoin,</hi> ſeven Leagues from
<hi>Chartres;</hi> the Canal between <hi>Pontgoin</hi> and
<hi>Berchere la Margot,</hi> containing 20000 <hi>Toiſes.</hi>
This Canal is brought along the Surface
of the Earth according to its Level, and
fifteen Foot downwards: Its height riſes or
falls, according to the ſituation of the
Ground; and the <hi>Talus</hi> or Slopeneſs of the
Banks is double of the depth. In the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
or Valley of <hi>Berchere,</hi> where the Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Maſon's-Work begins, there is a
Bank or Aqueduct of Earth erected, which
accompanies that of Stone-Work for the
Space of 3607 <hi>Toiſes.</hi> The Canal of this
Earthen Aqueduct is fifteen Foot broad at
the bottom, and ſix, ſeven, or eight Foot
broad at the top, the <hi>Talus</hi> being double
the height. The Sides or Banks are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by a Cauſey nine Foot broad, with
a <hi>Talus</hi> double the height, to keep the
Earth from falling. In the Valley of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chere,</hi>
the height of the Earthen Bank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to 100 Feet, in other parts to 70,
50, 40, and 20 Feet; and towards <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenon,</hi>
where 'tis joyn'd to the Stone-Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
its height riſes to 79 Feet. The
Stone Aqueduct is 2960 <hi>Toiſes</hi> long, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of 242 Arches: The breadth of the
Arches amounts to forty Feet; their Piles
are forty eight Foot long, and twenty four
broad, with Buttreſſes reaching eleven Feet
in breadth, and ſix in Projecture, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing.
In the deepeſt part there are three
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51877:41"/>
Arches one over another, like thoſe at <hi>Pont
du Guard</hi> in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Towards <hi>Berchere</hi>
there are thirty three ſingle Arches, ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
one double, forty ſix treble; then ſeventy
two double, and in the laſt place twenty
ſingle, which rejoin the Earthen Aqueduct
coming from towards <hi>Verſailles,</hi> at the height
of ſixty five Feet, which is gradually dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
for the ſpace of 6055 <hi>Toiſes,</hi> till it be
reduc'd even with the Terraſſes, and from
thence to <hi>Verſailles</hi> 'tis brought along the
Surface of the Ground, as between <hi>Pontgoin</hi>
and <hi>Berchere,</hi> for the ſpace of 25000 <hi>Toiſes,</hi>
unleſs in ſome parts where there is a Stone
Aqueduct hollow'd in the Ground. The
greateſt height of the Aqueduct in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of <hi>Maintenon,</hi> thro' which the Rivers of
<hi>Eure</hi> and <hi>Gaillardon</hi> paſs, and where the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Arches are, amounts to 216 Feet and
ſix Inches, to the Pavement of the upper
Wreaths or Edges, without reckoning the
Foundations, which are fifteen or ſixteen
Foot deep, or the Parapet of three Foot
and ſix Inches. The height of the firſt or
lower Arches to the top of the Concavity
of the Vault, amounts to ſeventy ſix Feet,
and to the Pavement of the ſecond Arches
eighty one Foot and ſix Inches. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Arches are ſeventy Foot high to the
top of the Concavity, and eighty five to
the Pavement of the Third, which are thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Foot and three Inches high to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity
of their Vault, and nine Foot nine
Inches more to the upper Wreaths, on which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51877:42"/>
there are Parapets of three Feet and ſix In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
The Canal is ſeven Foot broad at
the bottom, and widens by degrees till the
breadth is encreas'd to ſeven Feet and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Inches at the height of four Feet,
where the ſides begin to bow inwards, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of a Vault. On each ſide
of the Canal there is a Corridore three Foot,
and a Parapet ſeventeen Inches broad: The
Piles of the Arches are perpendicular above
the Ground on the inſide, and both the ſides.
Thro' the whole Aqueduct every <hi>Toiſe</hi> of
Work has an Inch of <hi>Talus</hi> or Sloping;
but the Buttreſſes have more above the
firſt or lower Arches; for on each ſide, the
Reclination or Narrowing amounts to about
ſeven Feet, and to almoſt ſix above the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Arches. There is a Door in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of each Pile, both in the ſecond and
third Arches, for the conveniency of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
along the Aqueduct; the Doors in the
ſecond Arches are four Foot broad, and
thoſe in the third three Foot ſix Inches
broad, and ſeven Foot high.</p>
            <p>After the Deſcription of the Caſtle of
<hi>Verſailles,</hi> it will not be improper to ſubjoin
a ſhort Account of the Church that <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
caus'd to be new-built from top to
bottom of hewn Stone, in the <hi>Ruë de Paris,</hi>
facing <hi>Ruë Daufine,</hi> which leads to the Place
or Square of the ſame Name. The
Portal, comprehending the two Towers, is
nineteen <hi>Toiſes</hi> broad, embelliſh'd with four
Columns of the <hi>Doric</hi> Order in Front; over
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51877:42"/>
which are four other Columns of the <hi>Ionic</hi>
Order, crown'd with a <hi>Fronton.</hi> The Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are adorn'd with the laſt-nam'd Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the whole with Sculpture; the
length of the Church without the Walls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to forty <hi>Toiſes,</hi> and within, from the
greater Altar to the great Door, to thirty.
The Nave is thirty two Foot broad, and
the Croſs is ſeventeen <hi>Toiſes</hi> long. In the
midſt of the Croſs, there is a <hi>Cupola</hi>
vaulted with Stone, ſix Foot and a
half high. The Lantern contains twenty
Feet in Diameter, and leans on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
on a great Square of Stone-Work eight
<hi>Toiſes</hi> broad. The height from the Key of
the Vault on the inſide, amounts to nine
<hi>Toiſes</hi> and a half; and from the <hi>Cope</hi> or
<hi>Cupola</hi> of the Lantern to the Pavement of
the Church, there are in all eighteen <hi>Toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
The inſide is adorn'd with the <hi>Doric</hi>
Order; and the great Altar is enrich'd with
forty <hi>Corinthian</hi> Columns of Marble, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
two Feet in Diameter, and crown'd
with their Entablatures and <hi>Frontons;</hi> and
beſides, all the Altars are garniſh'd with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
by the beſt Hands. At the ſide of
the Church <hi>Colbert</hi> caus'd a great Building
to be erected, containing Lodgings for the
Fathers of the <hi>Miſſion</hi> who ſerve here. It
runs parallel to the ſide of the Church,
reaching forty four <hi>Toiſes</hi> in length, and is
contiguous to the Houſes in the Street. It
encloſes a low Court, thirteen <hi>Toiſes</hi> ſquare,
and the thickneſs of the Building amounts
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51877:43"/>
to ſix <hi>Toiſes</hi> and two Feet. Below it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
a great <hi>Corridore,</hi> forty three <hi>Toiſes</hi> in
circumference, and twelve broad, with five
great Halls on the out-ſide. The Refectory
is at the Foot of the great Stair-caſe. The
loweſt and higheſt Story have each a great
<hi>Corridore,</hi> and contain above ſixty Cells, and
ten ſmall Apartments of two Rooms. The
whole Building, including the Places or Rooms
for the ſervice of the Houſe, contains above
one hundred and fifty Rooms, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Places. Both the Church, and the
reſt of the Edifice were deſign'd by <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Machine to raiſe Waters gave <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
occaſion to embelliſh <hi>Marly,</hi> whither the
King frequently retires from the Hurry of
Affairs, attended only by thoſe who are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Diverting him, and by his neceſſary
Servants. 'Tis ſeated in the Park of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles,</hi>
and enclos'd with another diſtinct
Park on the Road that leads to St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main:</hi>
At the end of the bottom where it
ſtands, there is a View open'd to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> and the places about it,
which makes one of the lovelieſt Proſpects
imaginable. The moſt conſiderable Charge
of this Building was occaſion'd by the drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and filling up of the Fenny-Grounds
to clear a ſpace for the Garden, and to
make ſo extraordinary a Ground-Plot as
that of the Situation of this Houſe; for
the Diſpoſition of its Plan is wholly ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
Paſſing along the Road of St. <hi>Germain,</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:51877:43"/>
aſſoon as you come to <hi>Marly,</hi> you enter
into a round Court of fifty <hi>Toiſes,</hi> with
Courts of Guard, Coach-Houſes, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
and from thence you perceive the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
at the end of a long Avenue or Walk,
of one hundred and fifteen <hi>Toiſes</hi> in length,
and ten in breadth, enclos'd with Walls on
each ſide, to keep in the Earth, and planted
with Trees. This Walk brings you to the
outward Court. The Caſtle is a diſtinct
Building, ſeparated from twelve other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilions,
ſix on each ſide, as they alſo are
from one another. The greateſt of theſe
Pavilions is twenty one <hi>Toiſes</hi> large in all its
Dimenſions, being a large and diſtinct Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
with four equal Faces: You aſcend
to it by round Steps bow'd inwards on both
Sides. The Lower Story is magnificent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
four Entries, which lead into a great
Octangular Hall, and ſeparate four large
Apartments, call'd <hi>The Four Seaſons.</hi> The
Hall is the chief Room, conſiſting of eight
Pannels, four great, and as many ſmall;
'tis eight <hi>Toiſes</hi> broad, and adorn'd with
chanell'd Pilaſters of the Compound Order,
with their Ornaments. The Doors of the
four Entries are in the large Pannels; and
in each of the ſmall ones there is a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Marble, plac'd on a jutting Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal.
The Order is crown'd with its Enta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blatures,
fram'd after an unuſual manner
with Corbels. Above is an <hi>Attic</hi> adorn'd with
half-body'd Statues of Women, ſuſtain'd by
Garlands of Flowers, and with their Hands
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51877:44"/>
ſupporting over their Heads an Entablature
conſiſting of an Architrav'd Cornice. The
Hall receives the Light thro' four Windows
in the <hi>Attic,</hi> under which, on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
Cornice in the inſide, are four Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conies
born by Eagles. The Vault that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
above the Cornice of the <hi>Attic</hi> conſiſts
of eight Pannels, which meet, and are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at a great round Moulding, cut by a rich
Wreath of Flowers, that ſerves for a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,
and a <hi>Spherical</hi> Vault. All the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Hall are of<note n="*" place="margin">A fine ſort of Clay or Plaiſter.</note> 
               <hi>Stuc,</hi> curiouſly
wrought; and in the midſt of the Vault
there hangs a prodigiouſly big Branch'd-Candleſtick
of <hi>Rock-Cryſtal,</hi> ten Foot high,
and ſix broad, adorn'd with ſeveral Rows
of Branches, ſupported by a large double
Eagle of <hi>Cryſtal,</hi> and ſurrounded with eight
other leſs Candleſticks, after the manner of
a Crown. The four Entries are longer
than broad, with relation to their depth,
containing four <hi>Toiſes</hi> in one Dimenſion,
and five and a half in the other, and are
embelliſh'd with Architecture, Sculpture, and
Marble Buſts. In each Entry there are two
great Tables of precious Marble, and two
large Pictures by <hi>Vander-Meulen,</hi> eight Foot
long, and five Foot high, repreſenting the
Sieges carry'd on, and Cities taken by His
Majeſty. Every one of theſe great Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is compos'd of three Rooms, an Anti-Chamber,
Chamber, and Cloſet; and the
Upper Story to which you aſcend by two
Stair-caſes, conſiſts of four Halls, one in the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51877:44"/>
middle of every Face. They are ſixteen
Foot broad, and ſerve for Anti-Chambers
to eight of the twelve little Apartments,
which conſiſt of two Rooms each. The
Dome of the great Hall is ſurrounded with
an Octangular <hi>Terraſs</hi> twelve Foot broad, and
little <hi>Corridores</hi> of half that breadth. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Decoration conſiſts in Pictures in
<hi>Freſco,</hi> after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner, being a great
<hi>Corinthian</hi> Order of Marble Pilaſters, having
only the Cornice in <hi>Relievo,</hi> to crown the
Maſs of the Building. On each Face a
<hi>Fronton</hi> crowns the Front-Building, without
any apparent Projecture, but what it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
from the Shadows of the Painting.
Between the Windows of the firſt Story
that are even with the Ground, there are
<hi>Baſſo-relievo's,</hi> Trophies, and Deviſes: And
the Angles are adorn'd with cleft Stones;
becauſe if the Cieling were Angular, the
Projecture or jutting forth of the Baſes and
Chapiters would appear mutilated. The
whole Edifice is terminated with Baliſters,
and has no apparent Roof: All the Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
Baſes, Chapiters, and Baliſters are of
Braſs gilt; and the Architecture is of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of ſeveral Colours. The other twelve
Pavilions are adorn'd after the ſame manner;
and ſix of 'em are of the <hi>Ionic</hi> Order: Each
Pavilion contains two Apartments, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and another in the firſt Story; every
one of 'em has ſix <hi>Toiſes</hi> in Front, and they
are thirty two <hi>Toiſes</hi> diſtant from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Beſides theſe thirteen Pavilions, there
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51877:45"/>
are two on the right ſide of the Caſtle that
faces the <hi>Paterre,</hi> in one of which is the
Chapel, embelliſh'd in the inſide with Pila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order; and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even with the Ground, is the Guard-Chamber,
and above that the Officers Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
To theſe Pavilions they have ſince
added two Wings, which being joyn'd to
two Walls built in form of an Arch of a
Circle, form an outward Court, containing
thirty five <hi>Toiſes</hi> in Diameter. At the foot
of the Deſcent from the Avenue on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, and over-againſt theſe two Pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
there are two others of the like Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
which make one half of the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and comprehend the Kitchens, and
other Offices or Work-Houſes, being thirty
<hi>Toiſes</hi> in Front, and incloſing a Court for
that uſe. Theſe two Pavilions are adorn'd
on the out-ſide like thoſe that are oppoſite
to 'em, and hide all that Building which
is appointed for the ſervice of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace:
They are joyn'd together by a Wall
painted by <hi>Rouſſeau</hi> in Perſpective, which
ſurprizes and charms the Beholder. All
theſe Pavilions, both the twelve of equal
bigneſs, and thoſe laſt mentioned, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
together by Trellis'd Arbours, fifteen
Foot broad, which form a Half-Moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Caſtle, and all the Arches of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
that compoſe 'em, end in Pavilions of
Trellis-Work. The Garden is ſo intermix'd
with the Building, that the Coaches never
paſs beyond the Grate between the two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilions
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51877:45"/>
on the other ſide of the Deſcent.
'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the Diſpoſition of
the Garden is as new as unuſual, conſiſting
of ſeveral Falls of <hi>Teraſſes,</hi> ſupported by ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Turfs, with Ever-green Trees, ſuch as
<hi>Firs, Yews, &amp;c.</hi> and you deſcend from one
to another by Stone Steps of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
bigneſs, and various Contrivance. The
<hi>Parterres</hi> are enclos'd with Baſons of divers
Figures, adorn'd with ſeveral Water-Spouts:
The Baſon behind the Caſtle is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable;
'tis in form of a Half-Moon,
thirty eight <hi>Toiſes</hi> broad, and its Water-Spout
riſes one hundred Foot high. The
Baſons of the <hi>Parterre</hi> are in number ſeven;
the firſt you meet with before the great
Deſcent of Steps, has Three Water-Spouts,
and contains twenty <hi>Toiſes</hi> in one Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and forty in the other. The greateſt
containing five Water-Spouts, is one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Toiſes</hi> long, and fifty broad; and the
laſt conſiſting of Pannels below, is ſeventy
<hi>Toiſes</hi> long, and thirty two broad, adorn'd
with three Water-Spouts. The other four
are round, of which two at the foot of the
Caſtle are ſmaller, each of 'em containing
ten <hi>Toiſes</hi> in Diameter; but the Diameter
of thoſe above contains ſixteen <hi>Toiſes.</hi> Both
the <hi>Terraſſes</hi> and Pavilions run ſloping, tho'
they are all plac'd level as well as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
And 'tis impoſſible to behold at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
without an agreeable Surprize, that
unuſual Scene of Buildings, <hi>Terraſſes,</hi> and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
variouſly intermixt, without Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51877:46"/>
like curious Works appearing diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on an advantageous Ground. The <hi>Park</hi>
of this Houſe is enclos'd with a Wall, and
divided by Croſs-Walks, ſome eight, and
others ſix <hi>Toiſes</hi> broad, where you have
ſometimes the Proſpect of the Caſtle, and
ſometimes of the Iron Grates before its
Entry: and that none of the Advantages
of the Situation might be loſt, there are
Groves of divers Figures contriv'd in the
Wood. The <hi>Park-Pale</hi> encloſes ſeveral large
Ponds, among which there are Three that
have twelve Foot of Water; the greateſt is
in the Middle, and its ſuperficial Extent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to 18000. <hi>Toiſes</hi> of Water, whereas
the other two together make but 2000: and
beſides there are two other larger Ponds, of a
Regular Figure. The Surface of the Water
in the firſt Pond is higher than that of the
laſt Baſon of the <hi>Parterre</hi> by thirty three
<hi>Toiſes:</hi> and beſides the Croſs-ways for
Coaches, there are Walks along the Walls
of the Encloſure, which open a Paſſage
thro' all the Parts of the Garden. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
<hi>Colbert</hi> had to make advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Bargains with the Work-men that were
employ'd in building the <hi>Royal Houſes,</hi> becauſe
they were oblig'd to addreſs themſelves to him
for Payment, gave him an Opportunity to
make his Houſe of <hi>Sceaux</hi> a magnificent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
I will not trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with a
particular Deſcription of all its Beauties, but
content my ſelf with mentioning the fineſt
Parts of the Garden. After you have paſs'd
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51877:46"/>
thro' ſeveral lovely Walks fenc'd with Hedge-Rows,
you come to the <hi>Pavilion of the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
ſo call'd, either becauſe the earlieſt Glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings
of the Light are diſcover'd there ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than in any other part, and that the
Morning ſeems only to break forth with a
deſign to ſhine upon ſo beautiful a Place, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that Goddeſs is painted there by the hand
of <hi>le Brun.</hi> This Pavilion has twelve Openings,
reckoning that of the Door; and, ſince 'tis
ſomewhat rais'd, there are two Stair-Caſes
oppoſite to one another, by which you aſcend
to it. Going from thence to the <hi>Hall of Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-Trees,</hi>
you meet with a fine Pond or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
at the Side of the Caſtle: there are five
lovely Fountains in the Hall, four towards
the Corners, and one in the Middle; and
ſomewhat lower there is a little Wood, made
after the faſhion of a Labyrinth, and full of
Water. Then you come to the <hi>Water-Walk,</hi>
which is adorn'd on both ſides with Buſts,
plac'd on ſmall Pedeſtals like Stools, and
Water-Spouts mounting as high as the Trellis.
Each Water-Spout appears between two Buſts,
and every Buſt between two Water-Spouts.
On each Side of the Walk there is a little
Ditch or Furrow, to receive the Water that
falls from ſo great a number of Spouts; and
at each of the four Corners there is a great
Shell for the ſame uſe. Behind the Buſts and
Water-Spouts there is a green Wall form'd by
large Trelliſſes; and, leaving this beautiful
Place, you enter into the <hi>Pavilion of the four
Winds,</hi> where you have a charming Proſpect.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51877:47"/>
From thence you paſs to the Canal, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
ſomewhat lower, you meet with a
Piece of Water, containing about ſix Acres,
which fronts a Caſcade at the other End of
the Garden. 'Tis on the Brow of a Hillock,
forming three Water-Walks, and adorn'd with
ſeveral Veſſels of Braſs between the Baſons,
out of which the Water-Spouts ariſe. It may
be juſtly ſaid to be altogether natural, for 'tis
fill'd with Running Water. <hi>Colbert</hi> did not only
deſign to make this Place a Houſe of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
for he annex'd a great Revene to it,
by tranſporting thither the <hi>Oxe-Market</hi> that
was formerly kept at <hi>Long-jumeau,</hi> to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of Trade, which was diminiſh'd by
that Alteration.</p>
            <p>The Deſire that Miniſter had to diſplay in
all Parts, the Grandeur and Magnificence of
his Maſter, made him alſo form ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
to encreaſe the Beauty and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of the Capital City. He began the
<hi>Cours</hi> on Ramparts with four Rows of Trees,
reaching from the Gate of S. <hi>Honoré</hi> to that
of S. <hi>Anthony:</hi> and on the other ſide of the
River 'twas thought ſufficient to make the
Deſcent of the Hill ſomewhat eaſier between
the Gates of S. <hi>Marcel</hi> and S. <hi>Victor.</hi> He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the Old Gates of S. <hi>Denis</hi> and S. <hi>Martin</hi>
to be beaten down; and, inſtead of theſe,
Triumphal Arches to be erected in Memory
of his Majeſty's Conqueſt of the greateſt
Part of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> in 1672. He
built the <hi>Key</hi> call'd <hi>Pelletier</hi>'s, or the <hi>New-Key,</hi>
with a Parapet, from <hi>Our Lady's Gate,</hi> to the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51877:47"/>
               <hi>Greve</hi> or Place of Execution, which it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſes
on the ſide next the <hi>Seine:</hi> and he
caus'd the Key to be lin'd with Stone, from
the firſt Wicket of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> near the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering-Place
for Horſes to the End of the
Old <hi>Cours.</hi> The Streets were alſo enlarg'd
by his Orders, which gave Occaſion to the
Preſident <hi>de Fourcy</hi> to make two New ones,
during the time of his <hi>Provoſtſhip</hi> or <hi>Mayoralty;</hi>
one of 'em reaching from S. <hi>Anthony's Street</hi>
to the Bridge that leads to <hi>Our Lady's Iſland,</hi>
and the other continuing the Street <hi>des Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaires</hi>
to <hi>Pont-Neuf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Publick is oblig'd to the ſame Miniſter
for the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Academy</hi> for
<hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Sculpture,</hi> in 1664. The <hi>King</hi>'s
<hi>Painters</hi> and <hi>Sculptors,</hi> with ſome others of
the moſt skilful Profeſſours of thoſe Arts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proſecuted at Law by the <hi>Maſter-Painters</hi>
of <hi>Paris,</hi> join'd together, and began to form
a Society, under the Name of the <hi>Royal Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy
for Sculpture and Painting.</hi> Their Deſign
was to keep publick Exerciſes to improve
thoſe ingenious Arts, and to advance 'em to
the higheſt Degree of Perfection. They put
themſelves under the Protection of Cardinal
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> and choſe Chancellour <hi>Seguier</hi> for
their Vice-Protectour: after which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
a Petition to the King, containing an
Account of all the <hi>Proſecutions</hi> that were ſet
on foot againſt 'em, to the great Prejudice of
the Art of Painting and Sculpture, which
their Enemies deſign'd to deprive of that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Liberty which is ſo natural to it, and to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51877:48"/>
make it ſubject to the Laws of a Mechanical
and Servile Trade. This Petition was favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
receiv'd, and by an Order of Council,
bearing Date the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1648. all
Perſons were prohibited to diſturb or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
the Academy in its Exerciſes. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
was, in its Infancy, compos'd of
twenty five Members; twelve Officers
call'd <hi>Elders,</hi> who were oblig'd to attend
monthly, and give publick Leſſons; eleven
<hi>Academicians,</hi> and two <hi>Syndics.</hi> The twelve
<hi>Elders</hi> were <hi>le Brun, Erard, Bourdon, de la Hyre,
Sarrazin, Corneille, Perrier, de Beaubrun, le Sueur,
Juſte d' Egtimont, Vanoſtad,</hi> and <hi>Guillemin:</hi> The
eleven <hi>Academicians</hi> were <hi>du Garnier, Vanmol,
Ferdinand, Boulogne, Montpecher, Hans, Terte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
ſenior, <hi>Gerard Goſin, Pinage, Benard,</hi> and
<hi>de Seve</hi> ſenior; and the two <hi>Syndics,</hi> now
call'd <hi>Uſhers,</hi> were <hi>Bellot</hi> and <hi>l' Eveque.</hi> Not
long after the Promulgation of the Order of
Council, 'twas thought convenient to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the reſpective Duties of the Members of
the <hi>Academy,</hi> and of the <hi>Students;</hi> and in the
<hi>February</hi> following, the <hi>Society</hi> drew up <hi>Thirteen
Articles</hi> of <hi>Regulation,</hi> which were approv'd
and ratify'd by <hi>Letters-Patents</hi> granted the ſame
Month. Five or ſix Years after 'twas found
by Experience, that it was neceſſary for the
Advancement of the <hi>Academy,</hi> to make ſome
Additions to the former Statutes; and <hi>Twenty
one New Articles</hi> were preſented to the King,
and ratify'd by Letters Patents in <hi>January
1655.</hi> Since that time his Majeſty perceiving
with Satifaction the Progreſs made by the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51877:48"/>
               <hi>Academy</hi> in the Deſign of their Inſtitution,
granted 'em new Statutes much more ample
than the firſt, ſupplying the Omiſſions, and
correcting the Faults that were obſerv'd in
the former Regulation. And theſe three Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
of Statutes, with the ſeveral Patents
in Confirmation of 'em, were regiſter'd in
the <hi>Parliament, Chamber of Accounts,</hi> and <hi>Court
of Aids,</hi> notwithſtanding all the Oppoſition
of the <hi>Maſter-Painters.</hi> After Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>'s
death, in 1663, the <hi>Academy</hi> begg'd
the Protection of Chancellor <hi>Seguier,</hi> and
made <hi>Colbert</hi> their <hi>Vice-Protector;</hi> at whoſe
ſolicitation they were finally eſtabliſh'd by
a Patent, containing new Privileges, in the
Year 1664. They were firſt lodg'd in the
Gallery of the <hi>Royal College</hi> of the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;</hi>
but afterwards his Majeſty granted 'em
more ſpacious Lodgings near the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi>
and after that another more convenient place,
in the Gallery of the <hi>Louvre.</hi> From thence
they were remov'd to the Palace <hi>Brion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the <hi>Palace Royal;</hi> and after that Houſe
was annex'd to the Duke of <hi>Chartres</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
they were plac<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in the <hi>Old Louvre.</hi>
There was alſo a Fund ſettl'd by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
in the Regiſter of the <hi>Royal Buildings,</hi>
to raiſe a conſiderable Penſion for the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the <hi>Academy,</hi> and to defray the
Charges of Models, and other neceſſary
Expences of that Society. All Suits and
Cauſes relating to their Functions, Works,
and Publick Exerciſes, are to be examin'd
by the <hi>Council of State,</hi> and the <hi>Academy</hi> it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51877:49"/>
ſelf being aſſembl'd, is declar'd Judge of
all differences that may ariſe about the Arts
of <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Sculpture.</hi> He that preſides
in the Aſſemblies receives an Oath of thoſe
that are deem'd capable of being admitted
Members of the <hi>Academy:</hi> And the Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
agreed on in theſe Meetings, have
the force of Statutes. The <hi>Academy</hi> alone
is empower'd to lay down Models, iſſue out
Advertiſements, and give publick Leſſons
concerning the Arts of <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
and what relates to, or depends upon
'em. And that none may be admitted to
profeſs theſe Arts by any other way or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
his Majeſty prohibited all Perſons
whatſoever, to aſſume the Title or Quality
of his <hi>Painters,</hi> or <hi>Sculptors,</hi> till they were
receiv'd into the <hi>Academy;</hi> revoking and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
void all Grants or Briefs that might
have been obtain'd for that purpoſe: So
that all thoſe who were in that Poſt were
oblig'd to enter into that Society, under
pain of loſing their Places. Beſides, the
<hi>Academy</hi> may keep publick Exerciſes in other
Places of the City, and erect <hi>Academical
Schools</hi> in all the Cities of the Kingdom,
by Virtue of a Patent, and Order of Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
granted by his Majeſty, in <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
1676.</hi> The ſame Monarch eſtabliſh'd an
<hi>Academy</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> where a Model is kept,
and Penſions allow'd to young Students, who
travel thither to ſtudy theſe Arts, after they
have gain'd the Prize in the <hi>Academy;</hi> and
that Society ſends one of its <hi>Rectors</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51877:49"/>
there. Thoſe who are poſſeſt of the
chief Places and Offices in the <hi>Academy,</hi> to
the number of forty, are exempted from all
Obligations whatſoever, to undertake the
charge of Guardians or Curators, or to keep
Watch and Ward, and have a right to the
great <hi>Committimus,</hi> or ſpecial Privileges for
that purpoſe. Thoſe who are brought up
in thoſe Arts by any Member of the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy,</hi>
tho' they have not ſufficient Merit to
be receiv'd into that Society, are to be
admitted to the Office and Dignity of a
<hi>Maſter</hi> in any place of the Kingdom, by
Virtue of a Certificate from the Perſon by
whom they were educated, ſeen and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
by the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> and counter-ſign'd
by the <hi>Secretary;</hi> and that Certificate has in
all reſpects the Force of a Brief, or Writ of
Apprenticeſhip. And the Works of the
Members of the <hi>Academy</hi> cannot be moulded
or copied without their permiſſion. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
that compoſe this Society are, firſt,
a <hi>Director,</hi> call'd by the firſt Statutes the
<hi>Head,</hi> who may be chang'd or continu'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Year; and the Company may chooſe
either one of their own Members, or any
other, whom they ſhall think fit to diſcharge
that Office: It was firſt poſſeſt by <hi>Charmois,</hi>
and in 1656 by <hi>Ratabon,</hi> Superintendant of
the Buildings. A <hi>Chancellor,</hi> whoſe Office
is for Life; he approves all Diſpatches, and
affixes the Seal, which has on one ſide, the
Image of the <hi>Protector,</hi> and on the other,
the Arms of the <hi>Academy:</hi> This Office was
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51877:50"/>
firſt executed by <hi>le Brun,</hi> who not only as
<hi>Chancellor,</hi> but alſo as his Majeſty's <hi>Chief
Painter,</hi> preſided in all the Aſſemblies, and
receiv'd the Oath. Four <hi>Rectors,</hi> alſo for
Life; and two <hi>Adjuncts,</hi> to ſupply the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of thoſe that are abſent: Their Office is
to ſerve quarterly, and to meet at the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy</hi>
with the <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> who is in Waiting,
to correct the Students, judge of thoſe who
excel their Fellows, and deſerve ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
and to diſpatch all other Affairs.
Twelve <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> two of whom may be
chang'd every Year by Lot; and Eight <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts:</hi>
The <hi>Profeſſors</hi> are oblig'd to ſerve by
turns Monthly, and during the time of
Waiting, to give Daily Attendance at the
<hi>Academy,</hi> to correct the Students, order the
Model and Poſtures for deſigning, and to
take care of other Affairs. There is alſo a
<hi>Profeſſor</hi> of <hi>Geometry,</hi> and another of <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
who read Leſſons twice a Week. A
<hi>Treaſurer,</hi> who receives and diſtributes the
King's Penſions, and is entruſted with the
principal Care of the Pictures, Sculptures,
Furniture, and Tools belonging to the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy.</hi>
Several <hi>Counſellors,</hi> who are divided
into two Claſſes; the firſt conſiſting of thoſe
who have already diſcharg'd the other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and the ſecond of Perſons of Merit,
who for their Love and Knowledge of thoſe
Arts, are receiv'd into the <hi>Academy,</hi> under
the Title of <hi>Counſellors, Lovers of Art;</hi> but
can never riſe to any higher Poſt, becauſe
their Skill is confin'd to ſome part, and they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51877:50"/>
do not profeſs the Art in its full extent:
All theſe <hi>Counſellors</hi> have a Deliberative Voice
in the Meetings of the Society. The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary</hi>
takes care of Affairs, keeps the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and counter-ſigns Diſpatches. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy</hi>
may alſo have two <hi>Uſhers</hi> to ſerve
them on all Occaſions, who are to enjoy
the Privileges of that Society, if they be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Painters</hi> or <hi>Sculptors.</hi> The <hi>Roman Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy</hi>
that has its Name from St. <hi>Luke,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inform'd of the erection of that of <hi>France,</hi>
and of the Merit of its Members, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to entertain a Correſpondence with
'em, both by way of Friendſhip, and for
the Improvement of the Arts they profeſs'd.
And to engage the <hi>French</hi> to a Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with her deſires, ſhe made the firſt
Step by chooſing <hi>le Brun</hi> for her <hi>Head</hi> two
Years ſucceſſively, tho' that Dignity is never
beſtow'd on any Perſon that lives out of
<hi>Rome.</hi> This Advance gave the King Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to grant Letters of Union of theſe
two Societies, in <hi>November</hi> 1676, which were
afterwards ratify'd by the <hi>Parliament.</hi> The
<hi>Academy</hi> receives none into its Body but
thoſe whoſe Merit has rais'd 'em above the
common Excellencies of Vulgar Artiſts:
Thoſe who profeſs the entire Art, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to the higheſt Offices in that Society;
but they who are only Maſters of ſome
particular Talents, and apply themſelves
wholly to <hi>Pictures, Landskips, Flowers</hi> or
<hi>Fruits,</hi> tho' they may be admitted into the
<hi>Academy,</hi> can never riſe above the Degree of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51877:51"/>
               <hi>Counſellors:</hi> And skilful <hi>Engravers</hi> are alſo
receiv'd on the ſame Conditions. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of their Reception is thus: Thoſe who
apply themſelves to <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> are
oblig'd to work a whole Month after a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
in preſence of the <hi>Waiting-Profeſſor:</hi> After
which there is a Subject preſcrib'd to 'em,
deſcribing the King's Heroical Actions in
Allegorical Figures. The Piece being finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is preſented to the <hi>Academy,</hi> who deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
by plurality of Voices, whether the
Deſign ought to be receiv'd: And if the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate</hi>
receive a favourable Sentence, he is
order'd to draw a Picture of a certain big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and that being examin'd and approv'd
by the Majority of Voices, he is ſworn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> and admitted into the
<hi>Academy.</hi> They who pretend only to ſome
particular Talent, preſent their Works as the
others, but are not oblig'd to draw from
the Life. <hi>Colbert</hi> being made <hi>Protector</hi> of the
<hi>Academy,</hi> after the Death of Chancellor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier,</hi>
thought fit that there ſhould be a <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographer</hi>
appointed, to collect all uſeful
and curious Obſervations that were made
at the Conferrences, and perſuaded his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to create one, with a Salary of 300
Livres. This Employment was beſtow'd on
<hi>Guillet de St. Georges,</hi> whom <hi>le Brun</hi> preſented
to that Miniſter; and he has ſince acquir'd
a great deal of Honour by the Works he
has communicated to the Publick; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others, by his <hi>Ancient and Modern A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
his <hi>Dictionary of Arts,</hi> and his <hi>Hiſtory of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51877:51"/>
Sultan Mahomet</hi> II. He was receiv'd on
the thirty firſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1682, and made
a very fine Diſcourſe in Praiſe of the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy,</hi>
and its <hi>Protector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I finiſh this Account of the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy,</hi>
it will not be improper to preſent the
Reader with a Catalogue of the Works of
<hi>le Brun,</hi> its firſt <hi>Director.</hi> He painted the
Battle and Triumph of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of five Pieces of Tapeſtry, repreſenting
a like number of the moſt glorious Actions
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Battle of <hi>Porus,</hi> the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51877:52"/>

Treaſurer of the Money rais'd by the
Sale of Offices. The Preſident <hi>Lambert</hi>'s
Gallery, and that of <hi>Apollo</hi> in the <hi>Old Louvre,</hi>
were alſo painted by him. And there are
ſome Pieces begun by him at <hi>Ramboüillet,</hi>
in the Guard-Chamber of the Palace-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
at St. <hi>Germans en Laye,</hi> and at the Houſe
of the <hi>United Farms,</hi> where Chancellor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier</hi>

            <p>The Learned World is alſo oblig'd
to <hi>Colbert</hi> for the Erection of the <hi>Academy
of Sciences,</hi> that meets twice every Week
in one of the Halls of the King's Library in
the Street <hi>Viviene,</hi> and had made ſo many
curious and uſeful Diſcoveries. On <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi>
they treat of <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> and on
<hi>Saturdays</hi> of <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> and other parts of the
<hi>Mathematicks.</hi> They have invented a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to determine the <hi>Longitude</hi> of Places,
which has been try'd in <hi>Denmark</hi> by his
Majeſty's Order; at <hi>Cayene</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and
in ſeveral Parts of the World, according to
the Directions of the <hi>Aſtronomers.</hi> Theſe
Obſervations were made, and are ſtill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
on every Year by <hi>Picard, Richer,</hi> and
<hi>de la Hyre,</hi> who are Members of that Body.
And during the Voyages that are underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
on this Occaſion, <hi>Caſſini</hi> remains ſtill
in the <hi>Obſervatory</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> to make like Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
at the ſame time with the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers.
They are all ſo juſt and exact,
that the <hi>Longitude</hi> may be certainly found
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51877:52"/>
out at any Diſtance, without incurring an
Error of above one hundred <hi>Toiſes,</hi> which
bear no proportion to the greatneſs of the

Library, was made <hi>Moderator</hi> of it, who was
ſucceeded by the Abbot <hi>de Lanion,</hi> and he
by <hi>Thevenot.</hi> The preſent <hi>Moderator</hi> is the

And it muſt be acknowledged, that
'tis one of the moſt Learned and Ingenious
Pieces extant on that Subject. <hi>Blondel, Camp-Maréchal,</hi>

to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> has compos'd a <hi>Courſe
of Architecture,</hi> with the Solutions of the

<hi>Caſſini,</hi> who was eſteem'd at <hi>Bologna</hi> the chief
<hi>Aſtronomer</hi> of his Age, has publiſh'd ſeveral
Treatiſes, and among the reſt, one concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> with their <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides,</hi>

<hi>Saturn,</hi> different from that of <hi>Huguens,</hi> a
<hi>Planiſphere,</hi> and a Diſcourſe of the <hi>Comet</hi> in
1680, and 1681. <hi>Picard</hi> wrote an Account
of his <hi>Voyage</hi> to <hi>Uraneburg,</hi> enrich'd with all
the <hi>Coeleſtial Obſervations</hi> he made in the ſame
place where <hi>Tycho Brahé</hi> contemplated the

of <hi>Conics,</hi> containing an Explication of that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51877:53"/>
hardeſt part of <hi>Geometry,</hi> to which in 1679,
he added new <hi>Elements</hi> of the <hi>Conic Sections,
Geometrical Places,</hi> and the <hi>Conſtruction</hi> of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quations.
Roëmer</hi> invented two Machines

He left <hi>Paris</hi> to return to the <hi>North,</hi>
where he was born, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
being deſirous to ſee him again. <hi>Mariotte</hi>
wrote three Books concerning the <hi>Organ</hi> of

or <hi>Phyſical Eſſays,</hi> of the <hi>Vegetation of Plants,</hi>
the Nature of the <hi>Air,</hi> and of <hi>Heat</hi> and
<hi>Cold. Duclos</hi> is the Author of two Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
one of the <hi>Mineral Waters</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the
other of <hi>Salts. Perrault</hi> tranſlated <hi>Vitruvius,</hi>
and illuſtrated his Author with learned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations,

Year 1670, a Treatiſe in Two Volumes,
<hi>De Corporum Affectionibus;</hi> and another alſo
in Two Volumes, <hi>De Corpore animato &amp; de

the Name of the whole Society. And to make
this Foundation more uſeful to the Publick,
<hi>Colbert</hi> caus'd an <hi>Obſervatory</hi> to be erected at the
end of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Suburbs, in the Year 1667. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1667"/>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Obſervatory</hi> is ſituated in the higheſt
place in the City towards the <hi>South,</hi> that the
Proſpect of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and eſpecially of the
<hi>Planets</hi> which move towards that part of the
Heavens, might not be obſtructed by the
Vapours of the River, or the Smoke that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
from the Houſes on the other ſide.
'Tis of a ſquare Figure, containing about
fifteen <hi>Toiſes</hi> on each ſide, with two Octan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Towers, at the Corners of the <hi>South</hi>
Front, of ſeven <hi>Toiſes</hi> in Diameter; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
ſquare, and ſomewhat leſs Tower in
the midſt of the oppoſite Face, where the
Entry is: And all the three Towers are of the
ſame height with the reſt of the Building.
The <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Tower is open from the ſecond
Story; and its two oppoſite Faces that front
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51877:54"/>
the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> are cleft or divided,
to make way for <hi>Teleſcopes</hi> of above fifty Foot
in length, for the conveniency of obſerving
the Paſſage of the <hi>Planets</hi> thro' the <hi>Meridian,</hi>
and on the <hi>North</hi> ſide to view the <hi>fix'd
Stars,</hi> at their coming to the <hi>Meridian,</hi>
both above and under the <hi>Pole,</hi> in order to
the finding of the <hi>Latitude</hi> or <hi>Elevation</hi> of the
<hi>Pole</hi> above our <hi>Horizon.</hi> The Tower in the
<hi>North</hi> Front is cover'd with Flints by way of
Plat-form, as is alſo the Body of the Edifice on
the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſide: And the Platform of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>
Tower is open in the middle, that
thoſe who are employ'd in obſerving the <hi>Stars</hi>
may be ſhelter'd from the Wind. The Building
below comprehends two Stories vaulted with
hewn Stone, the Walls being nine foot thick,
and ſixty ſix Foot high, comprehending the
Rail'd Gallery on the Platform. The lower
or half-Story of the whole Building, is on
the <hi>South</hi> ſide, back'd with a <hi>Terraſs</hi> rais'd
more than twenty Foot high above the
Field; ſo that the firſt Story lies almoſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
with the <hi>Terraſs,</hi> where there is a Pole
or Maſt that carries a <hi>Teleſcope</hi> ſeventy Foot
long, and a Tower of Timber-Work one
hundred and thirty Foot high. The Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
riſes ten <hi>Toiſes</hi> and a half above the
Ground, but reaches deeper under it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Quarries on which 'tis built:
And at the bottom of theſe there are wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stairs, that ſeem to hang in the Air by
the middle; where there is a void Place
fourteen <hi>Toiſes</hi> deep. Theſe Stairs are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under the middle of the Building; and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51877:54"/>
there are round Holes about three Foot in
Diameter, both in the Vault of the Ground-Floor,
and in the Vaults of the two Stories,
and alſo in the Platform. The Centres of
theſe four Holes are perpendicularly over
the Centre of the void place, in the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stairs: So that all together make, as it
were, one continu'd <hi>Pit</hi> twenty four <hi>Toiſes</hi>
and an half, or one hundred forty ſeven
Foot deep; which was deſign'd, and has
been made uſe of, for the Trial of ſeveral
Experiments; as to examine whether the
<hi>Stars</hi> in the <hi>Zenith</hi> might be ſeen in the
Day from the bottom of this depth; to
obſerve the Degrees of <hi>Acceleration</hi> in the
deſcent and fall of Bodies in the Air, and
the <hi>Vibrations</hi> of <hi>Pendulums</hi> under one hundred
forty ſeven Feet in length, without danger
of any Alteration from the Motion of the
Air; to make Obſervations with <hi>Barometers</hi>
above eighty Foot long, both with <hi>Mercury</hi>
alone, and Water alone; and to try with
Tin-Pipes of the ſame length, what height
of Water is requir'd to break the Pipes,
that it may be known how ſtrong thoſe
Pipes muſt be made, that are made uſe
of for the Conveyance of Water from a
high place to another of like heighth.
There were alſo Chambers dug out of the
Quarries, that it might be obſerved whether
Grains and Fruits cou'd be preſerv'd in 'em.
Beſides there have been Enquiries made to
diſcover the different Properties of the free
and open Air, and that which is inclos'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ground;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51877:55"/>
and a hundred Experiments have
been try'd both with <hi>Thermometers</hi> and <hi>Hydrome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
to obſerve the various Effects that proceed
from the different Degrees of Moiſture, Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Heat, and Cold both in Winter and
Summer; which curious and inſtructive Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
of natural Knowledge, may with
excellent Succeſs be apply'd to the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Medicine. From the lower Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you aſcend to the firſt and ſecond Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and even to the Platform of the whole
Building, by a Stair-Caſe as large as 'tis bold
and beautiful; 'Tis adorn'd with rich Iron
Baliſters, and ſeems to hang in the Air, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a void Place in the middle. Since the
Faces of the Building look directly to the
Four Parts of the World, and the Windows
of the ſecond Story are each eight Foot
broad, and twenty ſix Foot high, the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
<hi>Aſtronomer</hi> has a full Proſpect of the
whole Heavens, and enjoys the double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of fixing his Inſtruments in the
Walls, and of ſatisfying his Curioſity in a
cover'd Room, with Teleſcopes of fifteen or
twenty Foot; for thoſe Obſervations that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
Inſtruments of a greater Length muſt
be made on the <hi>Terraſs.</hi> In this Edifice there
is a Collection of all the Machines us'd by
Artificers, and the Warlike Engines of the
Ancients; ſo that here a Man may in a little
time be ſufficiently inſtructed, and fitted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſerve as an Engineer, or to teach the
Arts of <hi>Fortification</hi> and <hi>Navigation</hi> in an Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy.
Here is alſo a Burning-Glaſs, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51877:55"/>
melts Lead in an Inſtant, aſſoon as 'tis
plac'd on its <hi>Focus;</hi> a Planiſphere, containing
all the Stars that are viſible above the <hi>Horizon</hi>
of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſhewing their Situation in the
Heavens; and a Copper Machine, compos'd
of the Circles of the Sphere, carrying an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective-Glaſs
one hundred and forty Foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from the Solar <hi>Focus,</hi> which by the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Watch follows that of a Star, when
'tis only two or three Degrees elevated above
the <hi>Horizon:</hi> The Engine muſt be rais'd to
the heighth of ſix or ſeven Feet, till the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Glaſs be parallel to the Disk of
the Star; then retiring in a ſtreight Line
to the diſtance of one hundred and forty
Foot, place the Eye-Glaſs, ſo that the four
Centres of the Star, of the Surface of the
Objective-Glaſs, of the Eye-Glaſs, and of
the opening of the Ball of the Eye be in one
ſtreight Line: If the Star be conſiderably
elevated about the <hi>Horizon,</hi> the Machine
muſt be rais'd proportionably in the Air, by
a Rope, towards the Angles or Corners of
the above-mention'd woodden Tower, which
is a hundred and fifty Foot high, and ſtands
before the South-Front of the Obſervatory;
but you muſt learn by ſeveral Trials, and a
long continu'd Uſe, to follow the Star with
the Eye-Glaſs, ſo that the Eye may deſcribe
a Circle of almoſt a hundred and forty one
Foot of Rays, of which the Glaſs is the
Centre. Here is alſo to be ſeen a large
Aſtronomical Ring, that ſerves to find by
the Sun, the Hour and Minute, as well as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51877:56"/>
the Declination of the Magnet, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1664"/> for the Uſe
of Navigation; a Level with a Proſpective-Glaſs,
that comes quickly to an <hi>Aequilibrium;</hi>
and a very exact Figure of the Moon, with
all the hollow and riſing Parts that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in its Surface. And beſides, there is a
Machine for the Planets (fram'd according
to <hi>Copernicus</hi>'s Syſtem) which may be call'd
a <hi>Speaking Ephemeris,</hi> to find the Poſition of
the Heavens at any time propos'd, whether paſt,
preſent, or to come; the Longitude and Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of each Planet, and conſequently its true
Place in the Heavens at any time whatſover,
only by turning a Handle, as in the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Machine. It ſhews alſo the Swiftneſs and
Slowneſs of each Planet, its Excentricity, and
when it appears to us to ſtand ſtill or move
backwards; for the Machine is ſo contriv'd,
that it muſt of neceſſity follow both the ſwift
and ſlow Motion of every Planet, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to its neareſt, or retires to its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Diſtance from the Sun. There is alſo a
Pneumatical Engine for the Experiments of
<hi>Vacuum;</hi> a Machine to make Stuffs; one to
wind a hundred Hanks of Thread at once,
another to cleanſe Sea-Ports, and a <hi>Catapulta</hi>
of the Ancients. By what has been ſaid the
<hi>Reader</hi> will be eaſily convinc'd of the Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Obſervatory, and that the Ingenious
World is highly oblig'd to <hi>Colbert</hi> for employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Intereſt with the King, and his own
Care and Induſtry for the Foundation and
Erection of that Edifice, according to the
Directions of thoſe great Men that are now
lodg'd in it.</p>

               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:51877:56"/>
But theſe are not the only Obligations <hi>France</hi>
has to that Miniſter: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1667"/> She owes to him all the
Advantages ſhe receives by the Union of the
two Seas. The Succeſs of that Attempt is ſo
much the more ſurprizing, that it was always
before eſteem'd impoſſible. The Glory of
the Invention is due to <hi>Riquet,</hi> a Native of
<hi>Beziers,</hi> a Perſon of a happy <hi>Genius,</hi> and an
admirably quick and piercing Judgment; for
'twas he that found the Secret which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
before enter'd into the Imagination of
any Man. The ſeveral Offices he enjoy'd in
that Part of the Country, gave him an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to conſider it with great Care and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and the exact Knowledge he had of it
convinc'd him, that the way that leads from
<hi>Higher</hi> to <hi>Lower Languedoc</hi> was the only thing
that render'd the Deſign practicable; ſince on
both ſides there are Mountains of a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
height, the <hi>Pyrenean Hills</hi> on one ſide, and on
the other the <hi>Black Mountain,</hi> neither of which
cou'd ever have been divided by the united La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
of the whole Kingdom. He diſcover'd alſo
that there was only one place where the Water
of the Rivers that fall into the Ocean cou'd
be united to thoſe that fall into the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean.</hi>
That place is call'd <hi>Naurouſe,</hi> being a little
Eminency or Riſing-ground, bounded with
two Valleys, one of which runs ſloping
from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and is waſh'd by a little
River that falls into the <hi>Freſque,</hi> as that does
into the River <hi>Aude</hi> above <hi>Carcaſſone:</hi> And
the <hi>Aude</hi> empties it ſelf on one ſide, by its
natural Chanel, into the Lake of <hi>Vandres,</hi>
that communicates with the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:51877:57"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1664"/> and on the other, is convey'd by an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Canal to <hi>Narbon,</hi> from whence it runs
to the Sea. The other Valley that deſcends
from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> is croſs'd by the River
<hi>Lers,</hi> which enters into the <hi>Garonne</hi> below
<hi>Tholouſe.</hi> Now the Springs of theſe two little
Rivers of <hi>Aude</hi> and <hi>Lers,</hi> being at the Head
of the two Valleys, about a quarter of a
League diſtant from each other; <hi>Riquet</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that if they were Navigable, the
Boats that paſt along their Chanels might
be brought very near each other. All the
difficulty was to know whether a Baſon or
Pond cou'd be dug on the Eminency of
<hi>Naurouſe,</hi> and two Canals made to deſcend
on one ſide to the Head of the <hi>Lers,</hi> and
on the other to the Source of the River
<hi>Freſques,</hi> that falls into the <hi>Aude;</hi> and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ſuch a Pond cou'd be made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were poſſible to gather and bring
together a ſufficient quantity of Water to
fill the Canals, and make 'em Navigable.
To clear theſe Doubts, he viſited all the
neighbouring Mountains, examin'd the height
of the Sources of ſeveral Rivers that ariſe
among 'em, run over all the Country,
conſider'd every part attentively, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
the Ground ſo often, and ſo exactly,
that he was at laſt convinc'd of the Eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Attempt, to gather together the
Water of the little Rivers of <hi>Alſau, Bernaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Lampy, Lampillon, Rieutort,</hi> and <hi>Sor,</hi>
which fall from theſe Mountains into the
Plain of <hi>Revel,</hi> and the other Countries of
<hi>Laurageois.</hi> And beſides, he concluded that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51877:57"/>
by digging a Canal along the ſide of the
Hills, the Water of the Rivers might be
convey'd down to the Hillock of <hi>Naurouſe,</hi>
which he conſider'd as the Point of Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from whence the Waters might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
on both ſides towards the <hi>Ocean</hi>
and <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> to fill the Canals that
might be made for the conveniency of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation.
Theſe Conſiderations having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
him to undertake the Project, and
convinc'd him of a poſſibility of Succeſs;
he addreſs'd himſelf to <hi>Colbert,</hi> with whom
he prevail'd to mention the Deſign to the
King. But that Miniſter being unwilling
to engage his Majeſty in an unprofi<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able
Expence, propos'd that there might be a
Tryal made with a little Ditch, which was
accordingly begun in the <hi>Black Mountain,</hi>
above the Town of <hi>Revel,</hi> and carry'd on
ſo happily, that it brought the Water of the
above-mention'd Rivers to <hi>Naurouſe.</hi> So en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
a Succeſs of the firſt Eſſay, gave
a reaſonable Hope, or rather Aſſurance
of the happy Accompliſhment of the Main
Deſign, which was undertaken and carried
on with Vigour: And the little Ditch was
turn'd to a Canal of a convenient large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and depth, for the conveyance of a
ſufficient quantity of Water. It begins
near the Foreſt of <hi>Ramondins,</hi> a little above
the Head of the <hi>Alſau,</hi> and deſcending to
the little Rivulets of <hi>Comberouge</hi> and <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diere</hi>
takes in the River of <hi>Bernaſſon,</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Brook of the ſame name a little
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51877:58"/>
lower, after which it receives the Rivers of
<hi>Lampy</hi> and <hi>Lampillon,</hi> with the Brook <hi>Coſtere,</hi>
and empties all theſe Waters into the <hi>Sor</hi>
above <hi>Campinaſe.</hi> The whole Courſe of the
Canal is full of Windings, and contains
10761 <hi>Toiſes</hi> in length. That the Water of
thoſe Rivers might enter into the Canal,
'twas found neceſſary to to ſtop their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Courſe with ſeveral Banks or Dams of
well-cemented Earth, which were built of
ſo convenient a height, that when the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
riſes too high, it may run over the Banks,
and fall into its natural Chanels. Nor was
it deſign'd to leave the Beds of thoſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
perfectly dry, after the Baſons of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
were furniſh'd with a ſufficient
Stock of Water; and therefore there were
ſeveral Sluces made in the Ditch, call'd in
that Country <hi>Eſcampadous.</hi> The <hi>Sor</hi> having
receiv'd ſo conſiderable an Addition of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
carries 'em along with it for the ſpace
of 3449 <hi>Toiſes,</hi> to the Foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
where its Courſe is ſtopt by Banks like
to the former, to bring it into a new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
which, nevertheleſs, is only a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of the Ditch, and creeps along the
Hillocks to <hi>Naurouſe,</hi> for the ſpace of 19378
<hi>Toiſes.</hi> But leaſt the Water of all thoſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets
ſhould not be ſufficient to fill the
Ditch, eſpecially in the Summer when moſt
of 'em are dry, 'twas judg'd convenient to
ſeek out a fit place in the Mountain to
make ſo conſiderable a Receptacle, that it
might be in a readineſs on all Occaſions to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51877:58"/>
ſupply that defect. The place appointed for this
purpoſe is a Valley, a quarter of a League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Town of <hi>Revel,</hi> call'd <hi>The Valley of
S. Ferreol,</hi> from a great Farm of the ſame
name in the Neighbourhood; and 'twas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
that it might be fill'd with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Audaut</hi> that runs thro' it, together
with that which proceeds from the Snow
and Rains that happen very frequently in
the Mountain. The Valley is 760 <hi>Toiſes</hi> long,
and 550 broad, being very narrow at the
Head, wide in the Middle, and contracted
again at the End, by the approaching Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
that bound it on both ſides; and to
keep in the Water in form of a Lake, the
Mountains are join'd by a Cauſey, which
may be call'd a <hi>Third Hill,</hi> by reaſon of its
great thickneſs and height. Its breadth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to ſixty one <hi>Toiſes,</hi> and its Baſe is a
ſolid body of Stone-Work, founded on the
Rock, and as it were mortais'd into it, having
only one ſmall opening or hole vaulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and level with the Ground, to let out
the Water. 'Twas thought convenient to
follow the Courſe of the Brook <hi>Audaut</hi> that
runs thro' the Valley, and to contrive the
Paſſage on that ſide whither the Stream na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
tends, to prevent the Ruines or Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the Work, that might have been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
by a violent alteration of its Courſe;
and therefore the Paſſage was made nine
Foot broad, twelve Foot high, and ninety
ſix <hi>Toiſes</hi> long, in a crooked Line. On the
Body of Stone-Work there is a thick Wall,

reaching in a ſtreight Line from the Head
to the Foot of the Dam, and exceeding by
ſome <hi>Toiſes</hi> the height of the vaulted Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
In the thickneſs of the Wall there is
another Vault in form of a Gallery, the
Entry of which is towards the Foot of the
Cauſey; and its height as well as breadth is
parallel to that of the former. The Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
growing inſenſibly narrow towards the
bottom, contains but one <hi>Toiſe</hi> in breadth,
and a <hi>Toiſe</hi> and a half at the Head of the
Work: 'Tis only ſixty one <hi>Toiſes</hi> long,
becauſe it runs in a ſtreight Line; whereas
the length of the Aqueduct amounts to nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four <hi>Toiſes.</hi> Above, or at the Head of
the Cauſey, it anſwers perpendicularly to
the Orifice of the Aqueduct; and below 'tis
on the left ſide of its Mouth. Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus diſpos'd, there were three Croſs-Walls
built from one end of the Cauſey to
the other, being founded on the Stone-Work
that makes the Baſis of the Structure.
They are not only interlac'd with the Stone-Work
of the Gallery, thro' which they paſs
in form of a Croſs, but are alſo inſerted
into the two Hillocks that ſurround
the Valley. The firſt Wall at the Head of
the Cauſey is ſeven <hi>Toiſes</hi> high, eight or ten
broad, and twelve Foot thick at the end,
being largeſt below, becauſe of the ſlope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The ſecond being the higheſt of all
the three, is one hundred and eighteen <hi>Toiſes</hi>
long, fifteen Foot thick, and ſixteen <hi>Toiſes</hi>
and two Foot high: 'Tis plac'd almoſt in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51877:59"/>
the midſt of the Cauſey, at the diſtance of
thirty three <hi>Toiſes</hi> from the firſt; and the
length of it may be extended to two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ninety nine <hi>Toiſes</hi> and more. The third
makes the Foot of the Cauſey, and is thirty
one <hi>Toiſes</hi> diſtant from the ſecond: 'Tis
eight Foot thick, and equal to the firſt in
height and breadth. Of the two above-mention'd
Vaults, the lower lets out the
Waters of the Magazine; and the other
ſerves for an Entry to thoſe who go to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
or ſhut the Paſſage of the Water, by
means of two Brazen Trap-Doors, plac'd
horizontally in a Tower call'd <hi>The Drum,</hi>
which is join'd to the firſt or inward Wall;
the Openings of the two Vaults being in
the third or outward Wall. As for the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or Pond of <hi>Naurouſe,</hi> whether the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the <hi>Black Mountain,</hi> and of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazin
of St. <hi>Ferreol,</hi> are brought by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of <hi>Derivation;</hi> 'tis call'd <hi>The Point of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,</hi>
becauſe from thence the Water is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
on both ſides, to the Canals that
convey it to the two Seas. The Figure of
this Baſon is an Octangular Oval, its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Diameter containg 200 <hi>Toiſes,</hi> and its
leaſt 150: 'Tis lin'd with hewn Stone. It
receives the Water of the Ditch by one of
its Angles, and diſtributes it by two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
that iſſue out of the two other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.
One of theſe Canals bends its Courſe
towards the Ocean, and reaching the Valley
of <hi>Lers,</hi> falls into the <hi>Garonne:</hi> It has eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Sluces, both double and ſingle, which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51877:60"/>
make twenty ſeven Bodies of Sluces in the
ſpace of 28142 <hi>Toiſes,</hi> or fourteen <hi>French</hi>
Leagues. The other Canal, which runs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> to the Lake of <hi>Thun,</hi>
contains forty ſix Sluces, double, treble, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple,
and octuple, in the length of 99443
<hi>Toiſes,</hi> or almoſt fifty <hi>French</hi> Leagues. Beſides
theſe, there are two other Canals, one to empty
the Baſon when 'tis too full, by diſcharging
the ſuperfluous Water into the River <hi>Lers:</hi>
The ſecond which is not united to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
at its coming out of the Ditch, to drain
away the foul and muddy Water, that the
Baſon or Pond receiving only pure and
clean Water, may be freed from the uſual
Inconveniencies of other Ponds that are apt
to be gorg'd with Mud, and muſt be cleans'd
and hollow'd from time to time. The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Garonne</hi> contributed very much to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the deſign'd Communication of the
two Seas, by opening a free and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Paſſage to the Ocean: But the ſame
Conveniency was not to be found among
the Rivers that fall into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>
along the Coaſt of <hi>Languedoc;</hi> for the <hi>Aude</hi>
was not Navigable above <hi>Narbon,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
it enters into the Sea by the Lakes of
<hi>Bayes</hi> and <hi>Vandres,</hi> where the Road or Shoar
is ſo ſhallow, that 'twas impoſſible to make
a Haven. After an exact View of all the
Coaſt, there was no place found but <hi>Cape
de Sete,</hi> of a ſufficient depth for Veſſels of
five or ſix hundred Tun; and therefore 'twas
reſolv'd to make a Harbour there. <hi>Sete</hi> is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51877:60"/>
a Promontory, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1665"/> in the Neighbourhood of the
little Town of <hi>Frontignan,</hi> famous for its
<hi>Muſcadine</hi> Wine. The Sea is on one ſide
of it, and on the other it has the Lakes of
<hi>Thun, Maguelone,</hi> and <hi>Peraut,</hi> border'd with
the Plains of <hi>lower Languedoc;</hi> and on the
Right and Left-hand 'tis bounded with the
Strand, between thoſe Lakes and the Sea.
This Mountain thruſts a long Point into
the Sea; and on the other ſide the Sea ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
into the Land, making a Bay, where
the above-mention'd Depth was found.
The Shoar along the Strand is full of Sand,
as are all the Coaſts of <hi>Languedoc</hi> about the
Gulf of <hi>Leon;</hi> the Cape ſinks deeper, and
all around the Depth amounts to twenty or
twenty four Feet. Now theſe Lakes or Ponds
have no Water but what they receive by
the Inlets or Paſſages, which the Sea makes
when it beats ſtrongly againſt the Shore;
and theſe Inlets that open a Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between the Lakes and the Sea, are
chang'd according to the various alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Wind: So that there was only
a Paſſage for ſmall Veſſels, by reaſon of
the Shallowneſs of moſt of the Lakes, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and parts of the Sea where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
And therefore to accompliſh the intended
Communication of the Seas, 'twas neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to make a fit Harbour for all ſorts of
Ships. In order to the Execution of that
Deſign, the Lake of <hi>Thun</hi> was choſen, as
being the largeſt and deepeſt of all thoſe
Lakes, and not far from the Cape of <hi>Sete:</hi> 'Tis
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51877:61"/>
of great extent, and is twenty five or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Foot deep in ſeveral places: 'Tis equally
ſafe and commodious for ſailing, and in
caſe of neceſſity might ſerve for a Harbour.
For theſe reaſons 'twas thought fit to bring
the Canals that come from <hi>Naurouſe,</hi> and
communicate with the Ocean, to the Lake
on one ſide; and a Canal was alſo dug be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the other ſide and the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi>
The laſt Canal is two <hi>Toiſes</hi> deep, ſixteen
broad at the Surface, and eight at the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
and about eight hundred in length. The
whole Work was begun in 1666, after <hi>Riquet</hi>
had undertaken to warrant the Succeſs, and
was finiſh'd before his Death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
in the beginning of <hi>October</hi> 1680.
tho' it was not brought to the utmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Perfection, till afterwards, by the
care of his Sons, <hi>Bonrepos,</hi> Maſter of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
and <hi>Caraman,</hi> Captain of the Guards;
and his two Sons-in-Law, <hi>Grammont,</hi> Baron

            <p>After ſo many and ſo uſeful Deſigns for

Deſign, on the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1665, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
the Office of <hi>Treaſurer of the King's
Orders,</hi> vacant by the Death of <hi>Nouveau,</hi>
Superintendant of the <hi>Poſt-Office.</hi> The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of St. <hi>Michael</hi> was inſtituted on the firſt
of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1469, by King <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Knights being fixt to thirty ſix,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51877:61"/>
tho' it was afterwards encreas'd to one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
All the Knights of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> are
made Knights of St. <hi>Michael</hi> ſome days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they receive the Collar of their own
Order. The Order of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> was
inſtituted at <hi>Paris,</hi> on the firſt Day of the
Year 1579, by <hi>Henry</hi> III. in memory of
his having been advanc'd to the Crown of
<hi>Poland,</hi> and afterwards to that of <hi>France,</hi> on
the Feſtival of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The late
King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. conferr'd it on fifty Lords,
in the Year 1633. There were ſeventy
created in 1662, and ſeventy four in 1669.
The Badge of the Order is a <hi>Croſs of Gold,</hi>
faſten'd to a blue Ribban four Fingers
broad, and one embroider'd with Silver,
with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the middle, on the
<hi>Juſtaucor.</hi> The four Officers are the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
Maſter of the Ceremonies, Great Treaſurer,</hi>
and <hi>Secretary,</hi> who wear the ſame Badges
that are uſed by the Knights, even after they
have ſold their Offices.</p>
            <p>The liberty which the Sons of the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
of the King's Revenue had obtain'd to
poſſeſs Employments in the ſuperior Courts,
had rais'd the price of thoſe Offices ſo high,
that the Trade was conſiderably decay'd.
The Office of <hi>Counſellor</hi> in the <hi>Court of Aids,</hi>
was ſold for 40000 Crowns, that of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor</hi>
in the <hi>Great Council</hi> for 50000, of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor</hi>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51877:62"/>
               <hi>Colbert</hi>'s advice, publiſh'd an Edict in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
1665,</hi> by which the Rates of theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
were fixt; that of <hi>Preſident à Mortier</hi>

at 100000, of <hi>Counſellor</hi> in the <hi>Great

<hi>Chambers of Accounts</hi> at 40000 Crowns, of
the <hi>Counſellors</hi> at 20000 Crowns, except thoſe
of <hi>Rhoan,</hi> that were rais'd to 70000, and of
<hi>Mets,</hi> who were reduc'd to 36000. Theſe
Regulations were not at firſt attended with
the deſir'd Succeſs; for the Purchaſers elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Force and Deſign of the Edict by
private Bargains, which rais'd the Prizes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high above the appointed Rates. And
therefore <hi>Colbert</hi> perceiving that there was no
other way to moderate the Prizes of thoſe
Offices, reſolv'd to leſſen their Juriſdiction.
During the King's Minority, the Superiour
Courts were ambitious of raiſing their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
in imitation of the Parliament of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
that claims a ſhare in the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
The King himſelf carry'd his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
to the Parliament, and ſent 'em to the
<hi>Chamber of Accounts</hi> by his Uncle the Duke
of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and to the <hi>Court of Aids</hi> by the
Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> The Edicts were order'd
to be regiſter'd in the King's Preſence, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51877:62"/>
which the Parliament examin'd 'em, and
agreed to 'em with ſeveral Limitations; by
that means aſſuming a kind of Sovereign
Power, not much different from that of
the Crown. 'Tis true, the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi>
according to its Original Inſtitution, had a
right to take Cognizance of all the Affairs
of the Kingdom; and that Body being
compos'd of the Three Orders, repreſented
the <hi>States-General</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> At that time
the Authority of the Parliament was both
uſeful and innocent: Nor could the Power
of the King be invaded by that Aſſembly,
ſince they met only at a certain time of
the Year, and their Seſſion was confin'd to
Six Weeks. But after <hi>Lewis Hutin</hi> had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the Parliament a perpetual and fixt
Court, he reduc'd its Authority to a Right
of judging the Differences of Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
And this Abridgement of its Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
became ſtill more neceſſary when
<hi>Henry</hi> II. expos'd the Offices to Sale; for
Merit was no longer a neceſſary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Members of that Aſſembly,
and the Secrets of the State could not be
ſafely entruſted to young and unexperienc'd
Perſons. Beſides, 'tis certain that if the
Power and Juriſdiction of the Sovereign
Courts had not been reſtrain'd within their
ancient Bounds, <hi>France</hi> had not been at
preſent a <hi>Monarchical</hi> State, the Government
wou'd have been reduc'd to an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi>
and the King made a <hi>Doge</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> For
'tis only that unlimited Power he now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51877:63"/>
that has enabl'd him to execute thoſe
great Deſigns which make his Reign the
Subject of our Admiration. The Abuſes
that crept into the Adminiſtration of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
during the <hi>Regency,</hi> made the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſubject to two Inconveniencies, that
wou'd have infallibly ruin'd the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
Projects: <hi>Secrecy</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> are two
neceſſary Qualifications in all thoſe that are
intruſted with the Management of great
Attempts; neither of which cou'd have been
expected, if the King had been oblig'd to
take the Advice of the Parliament. For
what Method cou'd have been taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the divulging of thoſe Deliberations
that depended upon the Votes of ſo many
Perſons? nor had it ever been in the King's
Power to take Advantage of any favourable
Juncture, if he cou'd not have diſpatch'd his
Orders without ſummoning a Meeting of the
Chambers. The Eaſe and Intereſt of the
People on which theſe Innovations were
pretended to be grounded, was a meer fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
pretext; and never were they ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
oppreſs'd as in thoſe unhappy Times.
Theſe were the convincing Reaſons that
<hi>Colbert</hi> urg'd to his Majeſty, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with which, that Monarch laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
the uſual Cuſtom of keeping his Seat
of Juſtice in the Parliament, and of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Princes with his Edicts to the
<hi>Chamber of Accounts,</hi> and the <hi>Court of Aids:</hi>
And beſides, he ſav'd 100000 Livres which
he muſt have given to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:51877:63"/>
and 50000 to the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> All the
Edicts paſs'd without diſpute: And the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was afterwards humbl'd to ſuch a
degree, that <hi>Colbert</hi> contented himſelf with
ſending the Edicts to that Aſſembly by one of
the Conmmiſſaries of his Nephew <hi>Deſmarets:</hi>
And by this means the Rates of Offices in
that Company fell ſo low, that they are
now ſold for 70000 Livres. About the ſame
time a ſtop was put to the Proſecution of
the Farmers; and an <hi>Amneſty</hi> was granted
'em by an Edict in <hi>December</hi> 1665, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they ſhou'd pay the Summs at which
they were aſſeſs'd.</p>
            <p>But all theſe important Affairs of State
cou'd not make <hi>Colbert</hi> forget the embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Verſailles.</hi> The Architecture was
already brought to perfection; there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wanting to compleat that vaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
but ſuitable Furniture, and the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the inſide; and theſe he reſolv'd
to make the Object of his next Care. He
ſettl'd a Manufactory at the <hi>Gobelins,</hi> and
committed the Management of it to <hi>le Brun,</hi>
as the only fit Perſon for ſuch an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
That place was already famous for
dying of <hi>Scarlet,</hi> the Water of the River of
<hi>Gobelins</hi> being endu'd with a peculiar qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to brighten the Colour, and give it that
ſhining Luſtre which dazzles the Eye of the
Beholder. There <hi>Colbert</hi> order'd <hi>Tapeſtry-Hangings</hi>
to be made for the King's uſe,
after <hi>le Brun</hi>'s Deſigns: And in the ſame
place he employ'd Artiſts about <hi>Inlaid Stone-Work,</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:51877:64"/>
of ſuch exquiſite and coſtly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
that a ſquare Foot of it amounted to
above 1000 Crowns. Only precious Stones
were made uſe of in this Work, and ſome
of 'em were cut ſo ſmall, that 'twas almoſt
impoſſible to diſcern 'em before they were
put in their proper Places. This kind of
Work is very tedious, by reaſon of the
hardneſs of the Materials, and it requires ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Years to finiſh one Square. There he
alſo caus'd thoſe vaſt pieces of <hi>Goldſmith's-Work</hi>
to be made, that were ſince carry'd to
<hi>Verſailles;</hi> ſuch as Tables, Stands, Pitchers,
Bathing-Tubs, Boxes for Orange-Trees, and
Candleſticks, which were equally admirable
for their Largeneſs, and the Curiouſneſs of
the Sculpture. In the ſame place there
was a <hi>Gondola</hi> built for the Canal of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles,</hi>
and all the Ornaments were wrought
for the great Gallery. The Pilaſters, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nices,
and generally all the parts of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,
and the Body of the Work is of
<hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> garniſh'd with Ornaments of
Braſs gilt, according to <hi>Manſard</hi>'s Deſign.
The great Pannels between the Pilaſters are
full of large <hi>Looking-Glaſſes,</hi> the Junctures of
which are hid by Branches of Ornaments
and <hi>Groteſque</hi> Figures, ſpread over the Glaſſes
with ſo artful a Negligence, that twenty
of the largeſt of 'em ſeem to be only one
Piece.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1666"/> The difficulty of bringing thoſe large
Glaſſes from <hi>Venice,</hi> made <hi>Colbert</hi> ſet up a
<hi>Glaſs-Houſe</hi> in the <hi>Fauxburg</hi> of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:51877:64"/>
which he committed to the inſpection of
<hi>Ranchin,</hi> Secretary of the Council of <hi>Finances,
Pecquot,</hi> Clerk of the Council of <hi>Caſualties,</hi>
and <hi>Poquelain.</hi> Thither the rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought
Glaſſes are brought from <hi>Normandy;</hi>
and there they are poliſh'd and ſold. There
alſo the Quickſilver is laid on thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for Looking-Glaſſes, which are leſs
chargeable, and ſome of 'em much larger
than thoſe that are brought from <hi>Venice,</hi>
tho' they are not ſo fine. At the ſame
time he ſettl'd a Manufactory of <hi>French
Point,</hi> to leſſen the exceſſive chargeableneſs
of the Point of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> the price
of which was riſen ſo high, that one pair

for <hi>Mademoiſelle du Mont</hi> his Nurſe, with
her four Daughters, <hi>Petronille, Manque, Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bette,</hi>
and <hi>Janeton:</hi> She intreated that Prince,
for a Reward of the Care ſhe had taken of
him during his Infancy, to obtain a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
for her to ſet up a Manufactory of
<hi>French Point</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> The Count ſpoke to
<hi>Colbert</hi> in her favour, who, liking the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
ſettl'd her in the <hi>Fauxburg</hi> of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi>
and gave her one of the King's <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Switzers</hi> to guard her Door. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſhe apply'd her ſelf to the proſecution
of her Project, and gather'd together above
two hundred Young-Women, among whom
were ſeveral Daughters of Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
by whoſe aſſiſtance ſhe made ſuch
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51877:65"/>
fine Work that the <hi>Venice</hi>-Point was generally
ſlighted. The Manufactory was afterwards
remov'd to St. <hi>Saviours-ſtreet,</hi> and at laſt to
<hi>Chaumont-Houſe,</hi> near St. <hi>Denis</hi>'s-Gate. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle

to <hi>Portugal</hi> with <hi>Manque</hi> and <hi>Lisbette,</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>The great Charge the King was oblig'd
to maintain during the War againſt <hi>Spain,</hi>
had oblig'd him to <hi>alienate</hi> the greateſt part
of his <hi>Demaine:</hi> But <hi>Colbert</hi> being deſirous to
clear his Majeſty's Revenues, perſuaded him
to re-unite the alienated Crown-Lands to
the reſt of his <hi>Demaine;</hi> which was put in
execution by Virtue of an Edict ſet forth
in <hi>April</hi> 1667, on condition to reimburſe the
Purchaſers; but ſince moſt of 'em had been
tax'd, the King had but little to pay. The
ſame <hi>Miniſter</hi> undertook the <hi>Reformation of
Juſtice;</hi> and the ill ſucceſs of that Deſign
was, perhaps, owing either to the Unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of <hi>Puſſort,</hi> and the reſt whom he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in compiling the <hi>Code,</hi> or to their
Unwillingneſs to remove the Foundations
of Wrangling, leſt the Officers of the Courts
of Judicature ſhou'd remain without Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
To demonſtrate the Uſeleſneſs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51877:66"/>
of the new Regulation it muſt be obſerv'd,
that the Litigious <hi>Wrangling</hi> of <hi>Lawyers</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from <hi>Four</hi> Cauſes; the various Degrees
of Officers or Courts of Juſtice, the Conteſts
about their Juriſdiction, frivolous Suits and
Forms, and the confounding of Matter of Fact
with Matter of Law, which makes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to refer every Particular to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Head. The firſt Inconveniency might
have been eaſily remedy'd, by bringing the
Appeals from the Sentences of the Judges
of <hi>Signiories</hi> to the <hi>Preſidial Courts,</hi> to which
they are ſubordinate, where the Cauſe ſhou'd
be finally judg'd without any further Appeal;
and by bringing the Appeals from the Royal
Juriſdictions immediately to the Parliament,
without ſtopping at the Preſidial Courts. And
if it be objected, That the Parties wou'd by
ſuch a Regulation be engag'd in long and
chargeable Voyages; it ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that there lies always an Appeal to the
Parliament from the Sentence of the Preſidial
Courts, that have condemn'd or approv'd the
Judgment of their ſubordinate Royal Courts
of Juſtice. And beſides the Juriſdiction or
Diſtrict of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which is
certainly too wide, might be divided into
ſeveral Parts, by creating two other Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,
one at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and another at <hi>Poictiers;</hi>
as likewiſe <hi>Lower Languedoc</hi> might be taken
from the Parliament of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> by erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another at <hi>Nîmes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:51877:66"/>
The Conteſts between Courts concerning
their Juriſdictions, are chiefly occaſion'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe the <hi>Court of Aids</hi> has a Right to
cite before it, all the Cauſes in which the
King's Farmers are concern'd, or by reaſon
of the Audiences erected in the <hi>Courts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt;</hi>
which, according to ancient Cuſtom,
belong only to the <hi>Great Chamber,</hi> as
that alone has a Regiſtry of Enrollments;
for every Court reclaiming its Juriſdiction
under Pretext of ſome incidental Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
there are an infinite number of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes
occaſion'd. And beſides theſe, Conteſts
are frequently owing to the Oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Sentences or Decrees obtain'd for want
of Appearance, or of defending the Farmer
at the <hi>Great Chamber,</hi> tho' the Petitions were
preſented to one of the Chambers of <hi>Inqueſt.</hi>
The Code requires theſe Caſes to be judg'd
at the Bar, which is the true way to make
the Deciſion of the Incident or Bye-matter
laſt longer than the Judgment of the Main
Suit, becauſe the Advocates cannot be made
to confer; and there is always a Return
in Law againſt the Sentences given accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Opinion of the Bar. The only
way to redreſs theſe Inconveniencies is, with
reſpect to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> to reſtrain the <hi>Courts of
Requeſts</hi> of the Palace, and other ordinary
Juriſdictions, from taking Cognizance of
Matters belonging to the <hi>Court of Aids;</hi> or
elſe to hinder the <hi>Court of Aids</hi> from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
a Cauſe from the other Courts of
which they are actually poſſeſs'd. And the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51877:67"/>
               <hi>Second</hi> might be eaſily remedy'd, by reducing
the Courts of Inqueſt to their Primitive
State, and by ordering all Incidents to be
judg'd in the Court call'd <hi>The Chamber of the
Council,</hi> and all Petitions to be carry'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and either join'd, if they have a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the main Suit, or judg'd on the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
Relation of the Reporter, if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
or include a <hi>Proviſo.</hi> This Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would alſo reddreſs another Abuſe: for
the Hearings at ſeveral Courts of Inqueſt
falling out in one day; and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo an Audience at the Court, call'd the
<hi>Tournelle Civile,</hi> at the very ſame Hour, 'tis
impoſſible for the <hi>Advocates</hi> or <hi>Counſellours</hi> at
Law to be preſent in all thoſe places at once,
and therefore they are forc'd to incur the
Penalty for want of Appearance, which
might be prevented if there were no Audiences
at the Courts of Inqueſt, for then they wou'd
all remain at the <hi>Tournelle Civile.</hi> 'Tis true,
there are Hearings at the ſame Hour at the
Courts of Requeſts, in the Palace and in the
Town-Houſe; but that Inconveniency might
be alſo regulated, by excluding the <hi>Advocates</hi>
under Ten Years ſtanding from the Superior
Courts, and by reſtraining the old Advocates
from pleading before the ſubaltern or inferior
Courts.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the idle and unprofitable
Pleadings or Forms, it will appear that the
<hi>Code</hi> ought to cut off the Contradictions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joinders,
Replications, and all the New or
Additional Proofs and Reviews, which only
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51877:67"/>
make way for the Repetition of what had
been urg'd a hundred times before. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
there is another great Abuſe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Defaults for want of timely Defence;
for the Attorneys to gain time, demand in
the general a Copy of all the Inſtruments or
Pleadings, without mentioning particularly
which are neceſſary to 'em, and after they
have incurr'd the Default, they are receiv'd
as Opponents, without any previous Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
whether their Exceptions are well
or ill-grounded. The only effectual way to
redreſs this Abuſe, is to ordain that the Cauſe
ſhall be judg'd only by thoſe Pieces or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of which Copies have been given,
with an Expreſs Prohibition to make uſe of
any others; and this being ſuppos'd, if the
Proctor or Attorney do not put in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
within the time limited by the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
that in that Caſe he may and ſhall
be fin'd in his own Name; and that it ſhall
not be in the Judge's Power to moderate the
Fine. And beſides the Attorneys ought to
be reſtrain'd from withdrawing their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and oblig'd to communicate 'em to
the Reporter: for tho' the Regulation has
made 'em liable to a Pecuniary Mulct, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Bodily Reſtraint, they never pay
any thing, tho' by this means they have
gain'd a great deal of time.</p>
            <p>The laſt Article is of greateſt Importance,
ſince it relates to the Manifeſtation of the
Truth, which the Advocates endeavour to
diſguiſe with their Forms and Pleadings, ſo
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51877:68"/>
that 'tis almoſt impoſſible for the Judge to
diſcover it. For 'tis their conſtant Practice
to ſpend the time allow'd 'em in ſeveral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences
in the Pleading of one Cauſe, which
is often referr'd, and in the mean time the
Claims are not diſpatch'd; beſides that, the
Cauſe being put off from Week to Week,
it becomes a hard Task to remember what
has been already alledg'd. And therefore
to prevent ſuch an uſeleſs Waſte of Time,
the Plantiff ought to preſent an Account of
the Matter of Fact, which the Defendant
ſhou'd return corrected. And if the two
Proctors or Attorneys cannot come to an
Agreement concerning the Manner of Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Advocates ſhou'd endeavour to agree
at the Bar; or if they cannot reconcile their
Differences, they ſhou'd ſign a Referment,
which ought to be indors'd, and no Cauſe
brought to Hearing, till the Matter of Fact
be unexceptionably clear, and only ſome
Queſtions of Law remain to be decided:
Then he that pleads firſt ſhou'd read the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Matter of Fact, and afterwards
alledge his Reaſons, to prove his Claim in
Law; expecting the Reply of the Opponent.
Thus, only rare and nice Cauſes wou'd
be pleaded, and the Audience being freed
from the overwhelming Multitude of Suits,
wou'd quickly diſpatch all that came before
'em; nor wou'd there be any occaſion for
Rolls. Beſides, the ſame Cuſtom that is
ſometimes obſerv'd at the <hi>Chaſtelet,</hi> ought to
be be introduc'd into the Subaltern Courts:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51877:68"/>
The Attorneys ſhou'd be oblig'd to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
petty Affairs among themſelves, and
when they cannot agree, to referr the Caſe
to an old Practitioner, endorſing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
from whence an Appeal might be
brought before the <hi>Tournelle Civile;</hi> and
ſince 'tis to be ſuppos'd that only impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Caſes wou'd be pleaded, a farther Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
might be made to the <hi>Great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall, in the next place, proceed to ſome
particular Inſtances, and conſider the uſual
Practice with relation to Seizures, Arreſts,
Executions, and Decrees or Orders for Sale
of Goods. As for Seizures and Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
when a Man finds himſelf unable
to pay his Debts, he is reduc'd to Beggary,
with the ſeiz'd Goods in his poſſeſſion; and
during the time that is ſpent in the Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he becomes inſolvent, or the Summs
that were ſeiz'd are conſum'd by the charge
of the Diſtribution. This Abuſe might be
prevented, by ordaining that the Debtor ſhould
immediately conſign, aſſoon as the Goods
are ſeiz'd in his Poſſeſſion; and that the
Diſtribution be made by an old Attorney,
without any other charge than ſix <hi>Deniers</hi> in
the <hi>Livre.</hi> As for Executions, 'tis certain
that the charge of the Sale conſumes the
greateſt part of what it amounts to; whereas
it might be enacted, that he who procures the
Execution ſhall take the diſtrain'd Goods at
the price ſet upon 'em by the Sergeant, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51877:69"/>
that the Owner may claim and recover 'em,
before a Month be expir'd, if he can find
one who will allow him a greater Price.
The caſe is ſtill worſe with reſpect to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
for Sale of Goods, the charge of which
amounts to exceſſive Summs: But this Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
might be alſo redreſs'd, by granting
to the Attacher the Enjoyment and Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſeiz'd Goods, who ſhou'd be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to reſtore the Over-plus of the Price,
(after the ſatisfaction of his own Claim)
to be diſtributed among the Opponents, on
condition, that he may be caſt by the ſame
Opponents within a Year, reimburſing the
principal Summ, Intereſt, and Charge. I
could add many other Remarks on the Forms
of Proceeding at Law, but I have already
ſaid as much on that Subject as the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctneſs
of my intended Hiſtory will
allow.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time <hi>Nicholas de la Regnie,</hi>
then Maſter of Requeſts, and now Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor
of State, was made Lieutenant of the
Polity or Government of the City of <hi>Paris,</hi>
which would have certainly receiv'd great
Advantages by this new-created Office, if
a larger Juriſdiction had been annex'd
to it; and if at the ſame time ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Regulations had been made for the
ſecurity of the City and of Trade. 'Tis true,
that new Magiſtrate has redreſs'd ſeveral
Abuſes, and in ſome meaſure ſuppreſs'd the
Inſolency of Robbers, which was grown ſo
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51877:69"/>
intolerable, that 'twas not ſafe to walk in
the Night without a Guard. But the
City is not perfectly freed from that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency;
for the Watch-men are either
Robbers themſelves, or in League with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that are ſo; and the Commiſſaries of
the <hi>Chaſtelet</hi> are too remiſs in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of their Duty in their reſpective
Wards; either out of Careleſneſs, or for fear
of hazarding their Lives Nevertheleſs there
might be ſeveral Ways found out to put an
entire ſtop to theſe Diſorders. The Firſt is,
to oblige the Owners of Houſes, or their
principal Tenants, when the Land-lords do
not live in their own Houſes, to keep their
Doors lock'd after Nine a-clock at night in
Winter, and Ten in Summer, ſo that none
can go out or come in without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and to give notice to the Lieutenant
of the Polity of thoſe who are wont to go
abroad too frequently in the Night, that
he may proceed againſt 'em as he ſhall think
fit. In the ſecond place, the Land-lords or
their chief Tenants, might be enjoin'd to
ſeize on all the Fire-Arms that are in their
Houſes, and not to reſtore 'em to the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
till they take Horſe to go into the
Countrey. Thirdly, all Perſons ſhould be
forbidden to go to the places whither the
People reſort to ſmoke <hi>Tobacco,</hi> under pain
of being ſent to the Galleys; for thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are the Rendezvous of Rogues and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
Perſons. The Fourth and ſureſt way
to prevent theſe Abuſes, would be to put
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51877:70"/>
the Government of the City into the hands
of the Citizens, who are moſt concern'd,
and wou'd conſequently be moſt diligent in
the preſervation of its Peace and Security:
And, for that effect, 'twou'd be expedient in all
the Quarters or Wards of the City, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
Captains with their Officers, who
might be chang'd every three Years. Theſe
Captains might be oblig'd to keep Regiſters
of all Perſons in their reſpective Wards, of
their Age, Profeſſion, and Eſtate; whether
they are Boys or Girls; in the ſtate of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
or of Widowhood: So that no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
cou'd come to live in any part of the
City without the knowledge and leave of
the Captain of that Ward, who might be
injoyn'd not to grant a permiſſion to that
effect, till a Certificate were produc'd from
the Captain of the Ward, where the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer
had his laſt abode, teſtifying that
there were no Complaints againſt him all the
while he liv'd there, and ſhowing the reaſon of
his Removal. And if it be a Stranger new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come to Town, he might be oblig'd to
bring a Certificate to the ſame purpoſe,
from the Magiſtrates of the City where he
liv'd. In the mean time, ſince the Captain
of the Ward cou'd not be in juſtice oblig'd to
undergo ſo much trouble without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
there might be a moderate Fee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be given for every Certificate.
And beſides 'twou'd be convenient, in every
publick place where Streets meet, to ſet up
a Bell of a ſufficient bigneſs to be heard at
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51877:70"/>
the Captain's Lodging, and to ring an Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
on occaſion of any Diſorder or Tumult,
whether by Night or by Day. And at the
ſame time the Citziens liſted in the Company
of the Ward might be oblig'd to take Arms,
and attend the Captain, who is to march
with his Company to the Place where the
Alarum was rung, to quiet the Tumult, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Authors of it, and draw up an
Information to be ſign'd by all the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
and produc'd before the Lieutenant
Criminal, as a ſufficient Evidence for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Sentence againſt the Rioteers. Beſides,
the Captain alone ſhould be impower'd to
cauſe any Citizen within the Bounds of his
Ward, to be Arreſted or Apprehended either
for Debt or Crimes, and to ſerve Executions on
Moveable Goods; which would be a means
to prevent the Roguiſh Tricks of Sergeants,
who are oftentimes wont to rob thoſe Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
whither they are ſent to ſerve an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
or arreſt a Priſoner. And, finally,
there might be a certain Day appointed in
every Week, on which the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the
<hi>Polity</hi> ſhou'd be inform'd of all Occurrences
by the Captains of the Wards, and give
'em ſuch Inſtructions and Orders as he ſhou'd
judge fit to be executed.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another Abuſe, no leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
than thoſe already mention'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to <hi>Women</hi> that make a Trade of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery;</hi>
who are treated either with too
much Rigour or Indulgence on ſeveral Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions:
For the Commiſſaries are brib'd
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51877:71"/>
to connive at thoſe infamous Practices; and
if at any time they ſeize and impriſon lewd
Women, they are commonly ſuch as retain
ſome ſence of Decency, whoſe Houſes are
beſt ſtor'd with Furniture, and their Perſons
may be apprehended with leſs danger; while
common Proſtitutes are ſuffer'd to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted,
ſecur'd by their Poverty, and their
Guard of Bullies. Nevertheleſs, 'tis certain
that this Method is directly oppoſite to that
which ought to be obſerv'd; neither ought
the Officers to content themſelves barely
with diſlodging thoſe unhappy Creatures,
ſince they only remove to another Street,
where they ſet up the ſame Trade as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The care of redreſſing thoſe Abuſes
ought to be committed to the Captain of
the Ward, who being inform'd of the lewd
Practices of thoſe Whores, and of the
Women that procure 'em, ſhou'd either ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
'em out of the City, or ſhut 'em up
for ever in the Hoſpital. This Regulation
wou'd be attended with two very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
Conſequences; for <hi>Paris</hi> wou'd at
once be freed from <hi>Debauchery,</hi> and diſpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl'd
of <hi>Ruffians,</hi> who are maintain'd by thoſe
Women. But thoſe who make a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Figure in the World, if they occaſion
no ſcandal in the Neighbourhood, and keep
conſtant to one Man, ought not to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted;
and even they who take a greater
Liberty, and are not willing to be confin'd
to one Perſon, if they be rich, and receive
none but civil Perſons into their Houſes,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51877:71"/>
ſhou'd only be oblig'd to wear ſome Marks
of Diſtinction, as at <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus they might
be order'd never to go abroad in Coaches
or Chairs, and never to wear Hoods, Coifs,
Scarves or Gloves, that their Character and
Occupation might be known by their
Dreſs; for that wou'd be the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Method to leſſen their Numbers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly.</p>
            <p>The great Fines that are impos'd on thoſe
who play at forbidden <hi>Games,</hi> have in ſome
meaſure produc'd the Effect for which they
were deſign'd; yet there are ſtill ſome Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
where Gaming is very frequent, and
runs very high; and (which is worſe) there
are profeſs'd <hi>Rooks,</hi> who live on what they
get by cheating, and are ſupported by their
Confederate <hi>Hectors,</hi> with whom they ſhare
their diſhoneſt Gain. To ſuppreſs thoſe Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
'twou'd be convenient to limit the Summs
that are hazarded, ſo that none might loſe
above <hi>Ten Piſtoles</hi> at any ſort of Game, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
thoſe that ſuffer higher Gaming
in their Houſes, to be fin'd 1000 Crowns,
and thoſe who cheat at Play, to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys;
to be convicted by the Complaints of
the bubbl'd Loſers, and the Teſtimony of
the Spectators. The Captain of the Ward
might be empower'd and order'd to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Search after thoſe who are guilty of
theſe Diſorders, and to make his Enquiry
the more ſucceſsful, the third part of the
Fine might be given to the Informer;
and ſince there wou'd be a Man out of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51877:72"/>
each Houſe, in the Company, 'twou'd
be impoſſible to conceal or diſguiſe the
Truth.</p>
            <p>There cannot be a more pernicious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
than the <hi>Uſury</hi> of thoſe who lend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
on <hi>Pledges:</hi> But the care that is taken
to puniſh Uſurers, ſerves only to encreaſe
the Abuſe. For ſince they dare not drive
their Trade openly, they make uſe of <hi>He</hi>
and <hi>She-Brokers,</hi> who bring the Pledges, and
carry away the Money. Now theſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
are mere pilferring Vagabonds, who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing to loſe, aſſume a Privilege to
commit any Villany. Thus they give but
a part of the Money to the Borrowers, and
make 'em pay more than they receiv'd,
when they are deſirous to redeem their
Clothes, which are oftentimes utterly loſt,
becauſe 'tis impoſſible for 'em to diſcover
whither the Brokers carry'd 'em. So that
'twere certainly better to tolerate the lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>There are alſo great Abuſes committed in

Now the Price of <hi>Corn,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that of <hi>Bread,</hi> might be regulated
immediately after Harveſt. And there ought

and a Bill with the ſeveral Prizes hung
up at each End of the Market: and the

The Uſurpation of <hi>Noble Titles</hi> was none
of the leaſt Abuſes that crept into the
Kingdom, during the Troubles. 'Twas the
uſual Practice of thoſe who were ſcarce Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
to aſſume the Title of <hi>Counts</hi> and
<hi>Marquiſſes;</hi> and the Sons of Merchants had the
Impudence to add a <hi>Coronet</hi> to their <hi>Coat of
Arms,</hi> becauſe they were poſſeſs'd of ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
Theſe <hi>Rhodomontado's</hi> occaſion'd the <hi>Pun</hi>
of one of our <hi>Comical Poets;</hi>
            </p>

               <l>On trouve à chaque pas un Marquis ſuppoſé.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In order to the redreſſing of this Abuſe,
<hi>Colbert</hi> order'd the Claims of thoſe counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Nobles to be examin'd: and all thoſe
who pretended a Right to the Privileges of
the Nobility, were oblig'd to produc'd their
Titles before the Intendants of the reſpective
Provinces. And beſides, they who had in
publick Deeds aſſum'd the Title of <hi>Knight</hi> or
<hi>Eſquire,</hi> and were not able to prove their
Claim to thoſe Honours, were not only made
liable to the common Taxes, but were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſubmit to an extraordinory Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1668"/> Thus you ſee how diligently <hi>Colbert</hi> apply'd
himſelf to the Reformation of the State, but
in the mean time he neglected not the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of his Family. The King had
declar'd War againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> in Purſuance of
his Right to thoſe Countries in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
that were laps'd and devolv'd to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51877:73"/>
Queen; and had already made himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of ſeveral Places, the Principal of which
were <hi>Doüay, Tournay, Lille, Courtray, Oude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde,</hi>
and <hi>Charleroy,</hi> with all the <hi>Franche-Comté.
Clement</hi> IX. who was lately made
Pope, had employ'd his Miniſters to negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
a Peace between the two Crowns, and
the Conferences were appointed to be held
at <hi>Aix la Chapelle. Colbert</hi> procur'd the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his Majeſty's Plenipotentiary for his
Brother <hi>Charles,</hi> who arriv'd at that City
with a Magnificent Equipage, and was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after follow'd by the Baron <hi>de Bergeyk,</hi>
ſent in the ſame Quality by his Catholick
Majeſty; <hi>Franciotti,</hi> the Pope's <hi>Nuncio,</hi> Sir
<hi>William Temple,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador, and
<hi>Beverning,</hi> Ambaſſador from the States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
performing the Office of Mediatours.
The <hi>French</hi> maintain'd that by Right of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
which takes place and is in force
in the Dutchy of <hi>Brabant,</hi> the Lordſhip of
<hi>Mechlin,</hi> the Marquiſate of the <hi>Holy Empire,</hi>
the County of <hi>Aloſte,</hi> High <hi>Guelderland,</hi> of
which <hi>Ruremond</hi> is the Capital City, the
County of <hi>Namur,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Limburg,</hi>
the Lordſhips of <hi>Dalem, Valquemburg</hi> or <hi>Fauque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,
Roder-le-Duc,</hi> and other places beyond
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the County of <hi>Arlon,</hi> the Dutchy
of <hi>Cambray, Franche-Comté</hi> and the Dutchy
of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> the Daughters of the firſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
excluded the Males born in the ſecond.
To this Right the <hi>Spaniards</hi> oppos'd the
Queen's Renunciation by her Contract of
Marriage, of her Claim to the Inheritance
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51877:74"/>
of the Eſtates belonging to her Father and
Mother, pretending that her Renunciation
was a Part of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty. The
<hi>French</hi> wou'd not allow of that Connexion,
affirming that they were two ſeparate Acts,
and beſides, that the Renunciation was void,
as relating to an Inheritance that was not yet
fall'n, and that ſhe cou'd not abrogate the
local Cuſtom of thoſe Provinces; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſince the Condition of the Renunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was not accompliſh'd, the Dowry ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by the Contract not being paid: and
'twas further alledg'd, that ſhe never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
the Inheritance of her Brother,
Prince <hi>Baltaſar,</hi> who inherited the Dowry
of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>France</hi> his Mother. Tho' all
theſe Reaſons were more than ſufficient to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the Queen's Right, and tho' the King was
able to maintain her Title by his Arms, he
choſe rather to relinquiſh part of it for the
Love of Peace. He offer'd to reſtore <hi>Franche-Comté,</hi>
that belong'd to him both by Right
of Succeſſion and of Conqueſt, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himſelf with the Places he had taken
in <hi>Flanders. Charles Colbert</hi> made the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
and Mediators ſo ſenſible of the Reaſons on
which the King his Maſter's Claim was
founded, that the Baron <hi>de Bergeyk</hi> receiv'd
as a Favour the Offers of his moſt Chriſtian
Majeſty. Thus the <hi>Treaty</hi> was ſign'd on the
<hi>ſecond</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1668. and the Brother of our
Miniſter by ſo ſucceſsful a Negotiation, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
a way to a higher Preferment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:51877:74"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1669"/> 
               <hi>Colbert</hi> had no reaſon to complain of the
Ingratitude of his Maſter: He was made Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State in the room of <hi>Guene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaud,</hi>
and was entruſted with the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Affairs relating to the Sea; nor
were his Performances in that Poſt unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Confidence his Majeſty repos'd in
him. For he was ſo induſtrious to augment
the Naval Forces, that the King may ſtyle
himſelf Maſter of the Sea; ſince in the time
of Peace there is no Nation that dares refuſe
to ſalute his Flags.</p>
            <p>That Miniſter who made it his principal
Care to enrich his Maſter, by ſuppreſſing all
the Rights and Offices that might be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him, began with the <hi>Pariſis,</hi> and
the Rents upon the Entries, that were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
on the <hi>Third Peny</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> and yielded
Intereſt at the <hi>Seventh Peny,</hi> there being only
a Fund for two Quarters. The Duties on
the <hi>Gabels</hi> of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the Offices of
the King's Advocate and Attorney, for the
Garners and Chambers of that Province, had
the ſame Fate: and ſince he cou'd eaſily
exact the Taxes impos'd on thoſe who had
been concern'd in publick Buſineſs, out of the
Reimburſements that were due to 'em from
the ſuppreſs'd Rights, Rents and Offices; he
procur'd by the Edict that abrogated the
Chamber of Juſtice, all thoſe that were tax'd
to be reſtor'd to their Lands or Immoveable
Eſtates, that had been ſeiz'd, and even or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to be ſold; contenting himſelf with
retaining their Reimburſements. But he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51877:75"/>
from receiving any Benefit by that
<hi>Act of Grace,</hi> the three Treaſurers of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
the <hi>Monerot</hi>'s, <hi>Languet, Bance,</hi> and the
Heirs of <hi>Girardin,</hi> for the Reaſons alledg'd in
the Beginning of his Life.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, perceiving the King's
Zeal for the Extirpation of Hereſie, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
the Chamber inſtituted by the Edicts
of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rhoan,</hi> tho' they were not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divided as thoſe of <hi>Caſtres</hi> and <hi>Guien</hi>
(which were abrogated ſome Years before),
but admitted only one <hi>Huguenot,</hi> Counſellour,
every Year. 'Tis true, there was alſo one of
that Perſwaſion in each of the Courts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
but afterwards as their Places became
vacant, they were ſupply'd by <hi>Catholicks.</hi> At
the ſame time there was a <hi>Tournelle Civile</hi>
erected, to judge of all Cauſes under 1000
<hi>Crowns,</hi> to eaſe the Great Chamber and
Courts of Inqueſt, whither all the Suits
were transferr'd, that were depending in the
Chamber of the Edict at the time of its Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
And beſides, the Form of the
Court of Vacations was chang'd; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
formerly each Preſident <hi>à Mortier</hi> preſided
in it for the Space of a Week, and Affairs
of ſmall Importance were determin'd there,
by a definitive Sentence: two Preſidents
were appointed every Year, one to preſide
in the others Abſence, from the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
to S. <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi>'s Day, and its
Juriſdiction was confin'd to Matters imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Condition or Proviſo. Theſe new
Creations are of no great Importance, nor
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51877:75"/>
do they afford Matter for Variety of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections:
but 'twill not be improper to inſiſt
ſomewhat longer on the Examination of the
Criminal Code, the Regulation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and the Orders for the <hi>Committimus</hi> or
Special Letters of Priviledge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Criminal Code</hi> is as uſeleſs as the <hi>Civil:</hi>
for Affairs of ſmall Importance are oftentimes
kept longer in Agitation, than Proſecutions
for the moſt enormous Crimes; and the
Judges neglect theſe Caſes in which the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
is moſt deeply concern'd, eſpecially if
there be no private Perſon to carry on the
Purſuit at his proper Coſt. Theſe Abuſes
proceed from a twofold Cauſe: Firſt, the
Lieutenant Criminal of the <hi>Chaſtelet</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
with Multiplicity of Buſineſs; for I
mention only that Officer, becauſe in other
Courts of Juſtice, Affairs are diſpatch'd with
greater Expedition. Secondly, the Forms of
Proceeding are too long, both at the firſt
hearing, and after an Appeal. Now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
the Lieutenant Criminal to uſe greater
Expedition in the diſpatching of all ſorts of
Affairs, and not to neglect thoſe that are not
manag'd by a private Perſon, I wou'd appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
to the Courts of Requeſt in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
the Cognizance and Judgment of all
Actions and Purſuits againſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and to reſtrain private Perſons from
entering their Accuſations againſt Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
before the above-mention'd Officer; I
would have the Courts of Requeſt in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
abrogate and cancel all that is done at
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51877:76"/>
the <hi>Chaſtelet</hi> to the Prejudice of their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
and if Gentlemen be not directly
comprehended in the Accuſation, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
in it by the Examination of others
that are accus'd, in that Caſe the Lieutenant
Criminal ſhou'd be oblig'd to remit the
Proceſs to the Courts of Requeſt, and in
Caſe of Failure ſhou'd be liable to be call'd
in queſtion, and even interdicted by thoſe
Courts if they think fit. I wou'd alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
to the Provoſt of the Iſle of <hi>France,</hi>
and the Lieutenant of the ſhort Robe, the
Cognizance of all Cauſes and Criminal Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt Perſons that have no Habitation,
in which number ſhou'd be comprehended all
Pages or <hi>Valets de Chambre,</hi> Servants that wear
Livery, and Vagabonds that have no other
Employment than to wander about the
Streets, tho' they lodge not in a furniſh'd
Room: One of theſe Officers might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to judge and take Cognizance of all
Crimes committed in the Country, and the
other, of thoſe that are committed in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
with an expreſs Prohibition to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Criminal, and Commiſſaries of the
<hi>Chaſtelet,</hi> to proceed againſt Perſons of that
Character. And to oblige the King's Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and Lieutenant of the Short Robe not
to ſuffer thoſe to go unpuniſh'd who are not
charg'd by a private Perſon; I wou'd have all
thoſe that are condemn'd to undergo corporal
Puniſhment by the Lieutenant Criminal or
Courts of Requeſt, to be fin'd alſo in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Summs; which ſhou'd remain as a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51877:76"/>
Fund in the Hands of the Receiver, never to
be diverted to any other Uſe, but only for
the Payment of the Charges and Damages
of thoſe who ſhall purſue theſe Vagabonds,
who have nothing to loſe, and can make no
Reparation: for private Perſons wou'd wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
become Proſecutors, if they were ſure
to recover their Damages. As for the Forms
of Proceeding, 'twou'd be convenient to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
all Aſſignments or Appointments over,
to be heard on a Perſonal Summons, and
from the Summons on an Order for Corporal
Seizure. If there be no cauſe to require a
Warrant for Corporal Seizure, 'twou'd be
ſufficient to take out an Order of the Judge
to cite the Perſon accus'd to appear before
him, on ſuch a Day and Hour, there to be
examin'd and interrogated; and in caſe of
Non-appearance, for the Profit of the Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure,
the Reparations awarded by a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Sentence might be adjudg'd to the King's
Attorney and the Accuſer, without leaving
room for an Appeal. But the Judges ought
to proceed with more Caution, in iſſuing
out Orders of Corporal Seizure againſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and never to give any ſuch Warrants
but in caſe of Capital Crimes: whereas, on
the contrary, the Proſecution of Vagabonds
ſhou'd begin with Seizure of their Bodies,
which ſhou'd be immediately follow'd with
Examination on the Complaint made againſt
'em, and that with Information. Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, in my Opinion, a Puniſhment that
ought never to be inflicted on thoſe who
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51877:77"/>
have no Reputation or Senſe of Honour; for
to what purpoſe ſhou'd a Sentence be given
againſt a Criminal who is neither afraid of its
Execution, nor will perform what it ordains.
'Tis plain then that 'twou'd be a great deal
better to order the Men into the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and the Women to be impriſon'd, or
(for great Offences) to be tranſported to
the <hi>American</hi> Colonies: and the beſt way to
puniſh thoſe that are rich, is to drain their
Purſes. As for Proſecutions of Perſons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a particular Deſcription of the Party ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd,
the Action ought never to be prepar'd
for Hearing, nor proceed further than a bare
Information; for under that Diſguiſe a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
may be carry'd on againſt Perſons of
Quality, to charge 'em with Crimes of
which they were never guilty. And beſides
'twou'd be highly convenient to regulate the
Juriſdictions of Courts and Officers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
that there might be no Conteſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
'em, either by ſettling the Extent of
their Authority, or by ordaining that every
Action ſhou'd remain where 'twas firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
till it be determin'd by a definitive
Sentence.</p>
            <p>As for the Council, I wou'd take away all
<hi>Evocations</hi> or Removals of Cauſes from one
Court to another, and the Rules of Judges,
which put the Parties to a vaſt Charge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deciding the Main Suit; and create for
that Effect a <hi>Court of Evocations,</hi> to ſit at <hi>Lions</hi>
or <hi>Poictiers,</hi> which ſhou'd be compos'd of a
<hi>Preſident à Mortier,</hi> and two <hi>Counſellours</hi> of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51877:77"/>
               <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> a <hi>Preſident</hi> and two <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers</hi>
of the <hi>Great Council,</hi> a Preſident and
two <hi>Counſellours</hi> of the <hi>Court of Aids,</hi> and two
<hi>Counſellours</hi> out of each <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Court
of Aids</hi> in the Kingdom, to be taken, one
from the <hi>Seniors,</hi> and another from the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors,</hi>
and chang'd yearly. This Court ſhou'd
judge all Cauſes remov'd or transferr'd from
any other Court whatſoever; and to avoid
troubleſome Enquiries into conteſted Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
all the Officers of each Company ſhou'd
be oblig'd to remit their Genealogies into the
hands of the <hi>Attorney-General,</hi> containing 16.
Quarters, of which a Book ſhou'd be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
and re-printed every Year, as the State
of <hi>France,</hi> with all the Changes and Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
happening by Death, Marriage, or Sale
of Office. Thus when a Cauſe ſhou'd hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be transferr'd, the Book of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogies
of the Company, where the Cauſe
was in dependence, might be conſulted for a
Proof of the controverted Parentage; and
without further Trouble, Letters might be
granted under the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> importing a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
to the <hi>Court of Evocations.</hi> As for
the Rules of Judges, aſſoon as a Conflict is
form'd, inſtead of taking out a Writ in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of a Judge's Rule, Letters of Refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wou'd be diſpatch'd to the <hi>Court of Evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi>
The ſame Court might alſo be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
to judge of Reviews or Appeals of
Judgment; after the Council, upon a Petition
communicated to the Party, and his Anſwer,
without any other Inſtruction, ſhou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51877:78"/>
that there was an Overture for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
or Review. The Conſtitution of this
Court wou'd be attended with one very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Advantage, as being compos'd of
Officers belonging to all the other Courts, ſo
that they cou'd not be ignorant of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
and Manner of Proceeding in the
Companies from whence any Suit might
happen to be transferr'd; which is the uſual
Inconveniency of the Removal of a Cauſe
to another Parliament or <hi>Court of Aids,</hi> tho'
next to that where the Cauſe was depending;
ſince 'tis certain that the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi>
is not better acquainted with the Cuſtoms
and Manner of Proceeding in the Parliament
of <hi>Rhoan,</hi> than with thoſe that are obſerv'd
in the Parliament of <hi>Thoulouſe;</hi> and the ſame
Remark is equally applicable to the reſt. As
for the Reviews of Judgment, ſince they are
remitted to the ſame Chamber, the Sentence
formerly given is very rarely annull'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd that the New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
of <hi>Committimus's,</hi> or Special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
in behalf of priviledg'd Perſons to
their proper Judges, has in a very conſiderable
meaſure taken care to prevent the abuſing
of that Privilege, by depriving thoſe who
have a Right to it of the Power of
making uſe of it for ſmall Summs, or
of lending their Name to their Friends,
ſince they are oblig'd to ſignifie and
give notice of the Aſſignments they have
obtain'd, a Year before they can put in their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51877:78"/>
Claims at the Courts of Requeſts either in
the Palace or Town-houſe, for the Payment
of what is made over to 'em. But 'tis no
leſs certain, that many important Additions
might be made to that Regulation; for tho'
the Officers of the King and Princes, and
other priviledg'd Perſons ought not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from giving perſonal Attendance, by
going to manage Law-Suits in Places remote
from the Court, yet their Privileges are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with this Inconveniency, that many
Perſons are forc'd to relinquiſh their undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Rights, merely to avoid a chargeable Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Paris.</hi> And therefore there ought to
be a middle way found out to ſave the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of one Party, and the Rights of the
other. Thus the Intendants of the Place
where ſuch Differences ariſe, might take
cognizance of thoſe Caſes, and endeavour to
reconcile the contending Parties: but if the
Agreement ſeem impracticable, the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
might tranſmit to one of the Maſters
of Requeſts, the reſpective Inſtructions and
Claims of both Parties, with an Extract of
'em, and their own Opinion at the end of
it: And a Report of thoſe Pieces might be
made to the Council without further Charge
or other Writings, on which a <hi>Mandamus</hi>
might be iſſu'd out. In the mean time, ſince
the Courts of Requeſt in the Palace ought not
in Juſtice to be left without Employment,
beſides the Right of Judging in Criminal
Caſes, in which Gentlemen are concern'd,
theſe Courts ought to have the firſt Hearing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51877:79"/>

to determine Controverſies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heirs, Seizures, Repairing of Houſes,
Conditions of Service, Servants Wages, and
other petty Caſes that ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
out of the <hi>Chaſtelet.</hi> Beſides ſince there
are two of thoſe Courts, they might by
Turns, and from Month to Month, take
cognizance of Civil and Criminal Caſes:
and 'twou'd be ſufficient for the Courts of
Requeſt in the Town-Houſe, to meddle on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with thoſe Caſes which they are empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd
to determine Sovereignly, and without
Appeal.</p>
            <p>There were alſo <hi>Two Edicts</hi> publiſh'd in
1669, one for the Controllment of Warrants
or Diſpatches, and the other relating to the
Fines that are to be conſign'd for Appeals.
The firſt is moſt certainly advantageous to
the Publick, becauſe it prevents Ante-dates,
which were very frequent before; tho' at
the ſame time 'twou'd be no leſs convenient
to hinder the counterfeiting of Warrants,
which might be eaſily done, by obliging the
Sergeants to cauſe 'em to be ſign'd by thoſe
on whom they are ſerv'd, or in caſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal,
by any other Perſons, who might be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51877:79"/>
call'd for that purpoſe, and the Refuſers
might be fin'd on the Verbal Report of the
Sergeant, atteſted by two Witneſſes ſigning
the ſame with him. But the ſame Character
cannot be given of the other Edict, which
augments the Charges of thoſe who have the
beſt Right; ſince they muſt advance the Fine
before the Appeal can be judg'd. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to make this Edict uſeful, it ought to
be provided that the Sentence might be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
without giving Bail, till the Appealer
had conſign'd the Fine, which wou'd be
more effectual if it were augmented: And
beſides 'twou'd be convenient to oblige
the Opponents to acquieſce in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and the reſt to conſign before they
be admitted to oppone: for ſuch a Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wou'd leſſen the Number of Judgments
on Default. The Parliament of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to hinder the Execution of the Edict
for the Controllment of Warrants, iſſu'd out
an Order to oblige thoſe who were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to levy that Duty, to reſtore a Horſe, that
had been ſold for the Payment of the Fine
awarded againſt Deficients. The firſt Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
was not acceſſory to the paſſing of the
Order; but <hi>Colbert</hi> gave him to underſtand
that 'twas expected the Parliament wou'd
cancel it, unleſs they were reſolv'd to draw
a ſevere Puniſhment on the whole Body. The
ſame Miniſter wrote alſo to the Sollicitor-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and to the Advocates-General, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
'em to a more diligent Performance
of their Duties for the future. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51877:80"/>
endeavour'd to ward the Blow, and
propos'd ſeveral other Expedients; by which
they thought to ſave their Honour, yet at
laſt they were oblig'd to buy their Peace by
cancelling the Order. But they were not
the only Objects of <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Severity; for the
Lieutenant of the Polity met with a no leſs
rigorous Treatment, for endeavouring to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Leaſe of the little Shops that belong
to the King's <hi>Domaine,</hi> under Pretext that it
wou'd occaſion a Mutiny among the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-Sellers:
nevertheleſs the Leaſe paſs'd, and
the Lieutenant was forc'd to truckle.</p>
            <p>The main Deſign of that Miniſter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the Manner of Proceeding at Law,
was to give the People more leiſure to apply
themſelves to Trading; for the Advancement
of which he procur'd an Edict, containing
29 <hi>Articles,</hi> to be regiſter'd the ſame Year,
importing the Creation of a Company or
Office, for Enſuring the Adventurers of
<hi>France</hi> in the City of <hi>Paris.</hi> Several Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
had found a way to avoid conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Loſſes, by paying moderate Rates for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
their Veſſels and Goods. And that all
Traders might have the ſame Advantage, of
leſſening the Hazards they run in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Courſe of their Trade, for their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Encouragement to undertake and carry
on conſiderable Adventures with more Eaſe
and Security; <hi>Colbert</hi> caus'd a Company for a
General Enſuring-Office, with Common
Stock and Seals, to be incorporated and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
in St. <hi>Martin's-Street,</hi> which being in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51877:80"/>
Middle of the City, was the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place for all Parties concern'd. There a
Houſe was hir'd and Meetings held, to treat of
the Affairs of the Society, with a Permiſſion to
the Merchants, Adventurers, and others of the
Cities of <hi>Rohan, Nantes,</hi> St. <hi>Malo, Rochel</hi> and
other Places, who were already engag'd in
a like Project, to continue the ſame, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The Edict requires, that there be a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Stock or Fund of 300000 Livres, and
that the Company ſhall conſiſt of Thirty Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
Five of 'em to be elected by Plurality
of Voices, to execute the Office of <hi>Directors</hi>
for a limited Time; Two of the Five to be
remov'd ſix Months after their Election,
Three more after other ſix Months, and ſo
every ſix Months ſucceſſively, a like Number
being always choſen to ſucceed 'em; ſo that
there are ſtill two or three <hi>Directors</hi> who cannot
be continu'd for above two ſucceſſive Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and in that Number there muſt always
be three Traders. The Contract of the Society
containing 43 <hi>Articles,</hi> was preſented to the

The Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> had his Bayliff, and

A League was concluded between thoſe two

4 Provinces, and took 40 Cities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew

Marqueſs of <hi>Ormoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Marqueſs, who was no Enemy to
Love, cou'd not reſiſt the Charms of <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle
de la Sale,</hi> a Young Lady of Quality,
but of ſmall Fortune, and the Youngeſt of
Three Siſters. She cou'd not boaſt a regular
Beauty, for her Mouth was ſomewhat large,
and her Complexion too ruddy, but ſhe had
the Advantage of a fine Sett of Teeth, and
Sparkling Eyes; her Hair was of a lovely
light Aſh-colour; ſhe ſung prettily, danc'd
with a becoming Grace, and her pleaſant
Humour made her Converſation very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Her large Stature, and fine Shape ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
with Advantage in the Habit of a
Man, in which Dreſs the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormoy</hi>
made her often come to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and even
gave her a Key to the Park, that ſhe might
go there to wait for him. It happen'd one
day, that ſhe made uſe of her Key to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
her into that Place, when the King had
given Orders to ſuffer no Perſon whatſoever
to enter. <hi>Bontemps,</hi> Governour of the Park,
perceiving her at a conſiderable diſtance, took
her for a Man; and coming up to her, ask'd
her how ſhe came thither. So unexpected a
Salutation put her out of Countenance, and
not being able to conceal her Sex, ſhe told
him, that her Mother having attempted to
force her Inclinations in the Choice of a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51877:83"/>
Husband, ſhe came to beg his Majeſty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection:
and the Governour aſſur'd her, that
he wou'd do her all the Service he cou'd, and
ſpeak to the King in her Favour. Nor was he
unmindful of his Promiſe, for he acquainted
his Majeſty with the Adventure, whoſe Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
at the hearing of ſo rare an Accident,
was ſo great, that he went along with <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps</hi>
into the Park to diſcourſe with her.
She repeated to him the Story ſhe had inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to conceal her Intrigue with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs,
and he promis'd to enquire into the
Matter, and to ſecure her from any Violence
that ſhou'd be offer'd to her. In the mean
time he told her that 'twas fit ſhe ſhou'd have
ſome regard to the Decency of her Sex, and
deſir'd her to go to <hi>Bontemps</hi>'s Houſe, who
wou'd furniſh her with a more ſuitable Dreſs,
and after Dinner conduct her to a Convent,
where ſhe ſhou'd be ſafe from her Mother's
Perſecutions. In obedience to the King's
Deſire, the Governour carry'd her home with
him; where having chang'd her Habit, ſhe
was put into one of his Majeſty's Coaches,
and conducted by two Soldiers of the Guard,
to the Monaſtery of <hi>Benedictin Nuns,</hi> at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genteüil,</hi>
where ſhe liv'd two Years at the
King's Charge; who being afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
that the Relation ſhe made him of
her Fortune was a mere contriv'd Story, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
her to be ſet at Liberty; after which
ſhe return'd to her Mother. In the mean
time, ſo long an Abſence had wrought ſuch
a perfect Cure on the Marqueſs, that he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51877:84"/>
never thought of renewing his Intrigue;
and ſhe repair'd the Loſs of that Lover with
freſh Conqueſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Siſter made a better uſe of the
Company and Example of the <hi>Bernardin</hi>
Nuns; for ſhe was admitted into their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> a Convent of the ſame
Order. Her own Piety and Modeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
her no leſs effectually than her
Brother's Intereſt to his Majeſty, who made
her Abbeſs of <hi>Lys,</hi> near <hi>Melun.</hi> She receiv'd
the Benediction at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> from the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Paris,</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1667, and the whole

the number of the King's Veſſels, his next
Care was to furniſh 'em with Artillery.
About ſix Years before, there was a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
of Iron-Guns ſet up in ſome Forges
in <hi>Nivernois,</hi> thoſe eſpecially that are next
to the City of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and River of <hi>Loire:</hi>
But the hope of Succeſs in that Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
was much abated, after 'twas diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
that the Metal of the Mines in that
Country was ſo little fit for ſuch an Uſe,
that the caſt Pieces were not able to abide
the Tryals which the King's Commiſſioners
requir'd to be made of 'em, before they
wou'd receive 'em on Board. At laſt, in
1678, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1678"/> two Strangers and a Man of <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi>
undertook to correct the Fault of the
Metal; and for the accompliſhment of their
Promiſe, ſubmitted to a Tryal, which was
perform'd by Commiſſioner <hi>Du-Clos,</hi> with a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51877:84"/>
great deal of Exactneſs and Rigour. All the
Guns that were made by the Strangers
burſt at the firſt Shot; and thoſe that were
caſt by the Native of <hi>Dauphiné</hi> were thrice
diſcharg'd without receiving any Damage.
But this Trial did not ſatisfie <hi>Du-Clos,</hi> who
cou'd hardly give credit to his own Eyes;
he appointed two other Days, when they
were charg'd, and ſhot off with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Exactneſs imaginable, and the ſame Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
as before: Yet he ſtill ſuſpected the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
till on the third Day he ſaw 'em bear
the Shock of twenty Diſcharges that were
made one after another, without ſuffering
the Guns to cool. At laſt one and twenty
of 'em were ſent to <hi>Breſt,</hi> to be put on
board the Ships, and were there try'd by
the Captains, with as much exactneſs as if
they had never been diſcharg'd before: For
moſt of the other Guns that were brought
from <hi>Nivernois</hi> were ſo ſhatter'd and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
by <hi>Du-Clos</hi>'s Tryal, that they cou'd not
endure a ſecond at <hi>Breſt</hi> without burſting to
pieces. Prior <hi>Frantot</hi> was the Inventer of
this Secret; he had four Brothers kill'd in
the King's Service, and was a Soldier him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
till ſeveral Wounds he receiv'd in the
Wars, oblig'd him to leave that Profeſſion.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Treaty of <hi>Nimmeghen</hi> having put an

the Summs that were lent in 1674, by
the Officers of the Civil Government to his
Majeſty, for ſupplying the neceſſities of the
State: and thoſe who were unwilling to receive
their Reimburſements, had Rents aſſign'd
'em. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> perceiving
that <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Power, and Favour with his

him in the Perſon of his Nephew, the

Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> Count of <hi>Thorigny,</hi>
his Majeſty's Lieutenant-General in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>

that were preſent at his Son's Marriage,
to <hi>Sceaux,</hi> and regal'd 'em with a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Treat. The Family of <hi>Matignon</hi> is one
of the moſt ancient Houſes in <hi>Normandy;</hi>
and the Count of <hi>Thorigny</hi> can reckon five
or ſix Knights of the Order among his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
ſince the time of <hi>Maréchal de Matig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
who was one of the greateſt Men of
his Age. His Mother <hi>Eleonora</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
was a Princeſs of the Houſe of <hi>Longueville,</hi>
and Daughter of <hi>Mary</hi> or <hi>Margaret de Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,
Henry</hi> IV's Aunt. The Marquiſs de <hi>Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelay,</hi>
after a ſhort ſtay with his Bride, took
Poſt for <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where he arriv'd on the
<hi>25th.</hi> of the ſame Month; and having viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Arſenal, took a Review of eight
Galleys that were ready to depart; after
which he proceeded on his Journey to <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiné,</hi>
ſtopping at <hi>Toulon,</hi> and ſome other
Places where his Preſence was neceſſary;
and having ſeen the above-mention'd Guns
of a new Invention at St. <hi>Servais,</hi> above
St. <hi>Marcellin,</hi> on the Banks of the <hi>Iſere,</hi> he
return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> by the way of <hi>Lyons.</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:51877:86"/>
During his abode at <hi>Toulon,</hi> he order'd two
Companies, of one hundred Men each, by
the name of <hi>Soldiers, Guardians of the Ships,</hi>
to be levy'd under the command of the
Captain of the Port, and of the <hi>Chevalier
de Levy,</hi> Aid-Major of his Majeſty's Naval
Forces. The laſt of theſe Officers rais'd his
Company of one hundred choſen Men,
who had ſerv'd in the Marine, conſiſting
of twenty five Sergeants, as many Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and fifty private Centinels, all neatly
cloath'd.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the Preſident <hi>Colbert</hi>
took Journey for <hi>Munich,</hi> to treat of the
<hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Marriage with the Princeſs of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia.</hi>
Aſſoon as he had concluded the
Match, he ſent an Account of his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Brother, who receiv'd it before
that which was directed to his Majeſty
came to the Hands of <hi>Pompone,</hi> Secretary of
State, who was gone into the Country,
where he had order'd ſome Buildings to be
erected. <hi>Colbert</hi> went immediately to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
the King on the happy ſucceſs of
the Treaty, who was extreamly ſurpriz'd
that he had not the firſt notice of it; and
when <hi>Pompone</hi> came afterwards to give him
an Account of it, his Majeſty told him,
that he might return home, ſince he was ſo
full of Buſineſs; and that in the mean time
he would take care to put another into
his Place, who wou'd be more diligent in
the performance of his Duty. 'Tis thought
this Affair was concerted between the two
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51877:87"/>
Brothers, and that a Courier was diſpatch'd
to <hi>Colbert</hi> before there was one ſent to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone;</hi>
to lay a Snare for that Miniſter, that
his Diſgrace might be a ſtep to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Preſident's Fortune. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
'tis certain that <hi>Colbert</hi> obtain'd the vacant
Place for his Brother, and perform'd the
Duties of it during his Abſence. There was
no need of this new Acceſſion to that vaſt
Load of Buſineſs he was oblig'd to ſuſtain;
for his Mind was ſo fatigu'd with ſuch a
multiplicity of Cares, that, notwithſtanding
his accuſtom'd Gravity, he choſe rather to
commit an Action that was equally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with his Dignity, and the Rules of
Civility, than to bear the importunity of a
Lady of great Quality, who was one Day
urging him to do her a Piece of Service
which he judg'd to be impracticable. The
Lady perceiving his Inflexibility, threw her
ſelf at his Feet in the Hall of Audience,
in the preſence of above one hundred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and burſting forth into Tears, cry'd
out, <hi>I beg Your Grandeur, in the Name of God,
to grant me this Favour:</hi> And he kneeling
down over-againſt her, reply'd in the ſame
mournful Tone, <hi>I conjure You, Madam, in
the Name of God, not to diſturb me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis de Roxel de Medavy de Grancey,</hi>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Roüen,</hi> having demanded a
Coadjutor to aſſiſt him in the Government
of his Dioceſs, <hi>Colbert</hi> obtain'd of the King
the Nomination to that Dignity for his Son,
the Abbot. And while that Prelate was
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51877:87"/>
expecting his Bulls from <hi>Rome,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1680"/> his Brother-in-Law,
the Duke of <hi>Mortemar,</hi> began his
Travels to <hi>Italy,</hi> with a reſolution to viſit
all the Courts in that Countrey. He began
with that of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and from thence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Modena,</hi> he went to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi>
where he was receiv'd with great
Marks of Honour by the Cardinal <hi>Guaſtaldi,</hi>
Legat of that place. Proceeding on his
Journey, he viſited the <hi>Great Duke</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi>
and arriving at <hi>Rome,</hi> met with a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Treatment from Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI.
in conſideration of his Father, the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal
Duke <hi>de Vivone,</hi> who was <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi>
of the Galleys of the the Holy See at
<hi>Candy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay,</hi> immediately
after his return from <hi>Provence,</hi> began ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Journey to <hi>Rochefort, Bourdeaux,</hi> and
<hi>Bayonne;</hi> and after he had given ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
concerning thoſe places, he accompany'd
the King in his Progreſs to the Coaſt of
<hi>Picardy.</hi> His Majeſty began with the Port
of <hi>Ambleteuſe,</hi> the Situation of which he
examin'd with the Marqueſs <hi>de Vauban,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<hi>de Camp.</hi> From thence he went to
the Port of <hi>Wiſſan,</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleteuſe;</hi>
and after he had viſited the Fort of
<hi>Mulon,</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Calice,</hi> from whence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Verſailles.</hi> Thus <hi>Colbert</hi> had the
pleaſure to ſee how well his Relations em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
their time, and with how much Care
and Succeſs they made their Court; but
his Joy was moderated by the News he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51877:88"/>
of the Death of his Siſter, the Abbeſs
of St. <hi>Clare</hi> at <hi>Rheims,</hi> who was much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by all the Nuns that were under her
Government.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King perſiſted in
his Reſolution to extirpate <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and by
<hi>Colbert</hi>'s advice, eſtabliſh'd a Regulation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Royal Farms or Leaſes, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that none but <hi>Catholicks</hi> ſhou'd be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
admitted to take either Farms, or
Under-Farms; and that no <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhou'd
be employ'd as Directors, Commiſſaries, or
in any Office whatſoever, for the levying
and collecting of Money.</p>
            <p>The Abbot <hi>Colbert</hi> having receiv'd his
Bulls, was conſecrated in the Church of the
<hi>Sorbonne,</hi> Titulary Archbiſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rohan,</hi> aſſiſted by the
Biſhops of <hi>Bayeux</hi> and <hi>Lizieux</hi> his Suffragans;
after which he ſet forward to take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Coadjutorſhip of <hi>Rohan,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
by the Coadjutor of <hi>Arles,</hi> the Biſhop
of <hi>Lizieux,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Grignan,</hi> nam'd
to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Eureux,</hi> and arriving at
<hi>Gaillon,</hi> was receiv'd with a great deal of
Magnificence by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rohan,</hi>
to whom that Houſe belong'd, and there
complimented by <hi>Lewis le Blanc,</hi> Intendant
of the Generality of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and <hi>Maſcarany,</hi>
Great-Maſter of the Waters and Foreſts.
The next Day in the After-noon he departed
with the Biſhop of <hi>Lizieux,</hi> and arriving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
five a-clock at Port St. <hi>Oüen,</hi> was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by above thirty of his Canons, with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51877:88"/>
ſeveral Perſons of Quality: Proceeding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he was met by <hi>Claude Pelot,</hi> firſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
of the Parliament, and ſeveral of the
moſt conſiderable Members of the other
Companies, who made a Convoy or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valcade
of above fifty Coaches, to conduct
him to his Archiepiſcopal Palace, where he
arriv'd on the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1680, and
after he had given Audience to the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Chapter, went to St. <hi>Heibland,</hi>
where he was receiv'd by the Curate of the
Pariſh. There he put off his Shooes and
Stockings, and clothing himſelf with a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet
and Camail, march'd barefoot towards
the Cathedral, accompany'd with the Priors
and Monks of the Abbey of St. <hi>Oüen,</hi> all in
Copes, the Ancient and Reform'd Monks ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
each their Prior. He found all the Way
from that Pariſh to <hi>Nôtre-Dame</hi> matted, and
was receiv'd at the Gate by <hi>Bretel de Gremonville,</hi>
Dean of the Chapter, with all the Canons
and Curates of the Chapel, in rich Copes.
After the Dean had preſented the Holy
Water, and given the Croſs to the Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutor
to kiſs it, the Prior of the Ancient
Monks, addreſſing himſelf to the whole
Chapter, <hi>We give you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>our Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
alive, and you ſhall reſtore him dead.</hi> The
meaning of that Expreſſion depends on the
uſual Cuſtom of expoſing the Bodies of the
dead Archbiſhops in State at this Monaſtery.
That Ceremony being finiſh'd, the Dean
preſenting his Church to him, ask'd his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and made him ſwear the uſual Oath
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51877:89"/>
on the Goſpels. Then the Coadjutor put
on his Shooes and Stockings at St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
after he had offer'd a Crown of Gold
at the Altar of Vows. At laſt having been
receiv'd into the Chapter as a Canon, and
into the Pontifical Chair in the Choir as
Archbiſhop, he heard Maſs ſung, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
treated the whole Chapter at three
Tables, which were ſerv'd with equal Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
and Profuſion.</p>
            <p>That Prelate's Father having accompany'd
the King in his Journey to the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
was attack'd with a Fever, the Fits of which
laſted fifteen Hours: He was cur'd with
the <hi>Peruvian Bark,</hi> prepar'd by an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Phyſician; and ſo conſiderable a Succeſs
brought that Remedy into Vogue. About
the ſame time the Marqueſs <hi>de Torſy,</hi> Son of
<hi>Charles Colbert,</hi> Secretary of State, defended
<hi>Theſes</hi> dedicated to his Majeſty, which
he preſented to the whole Royal Family,
in magnificent Boxes. There that Monarch
was repreſented, giving Peace with one hand
to <hi>Europe,</hi> who was arm'd to denote Power,
and accompany'd with a <hi>Tiara</hi> and Keys,
to ſignifie that it was the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> part of
<hi>Europe. Diſcord,</hi> and the <hi>Fury of War,</hi> whom
the King had vanquiſh'd, were under his
Feet; and with his other Hand he ſtopp'd
the Courſe of <hi>Victory,</hi> who was inciting him
to new Conqueſts. <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> held his
Majeſty's Thunder; and the latter was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by <hi>Abundance, Magnificence,</hi> and <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.</hi>
Above the King was <hi>Glory</hi> ſetting
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51877:89"/>
a Crown on his Head, and the <hi>Love of
Immoratality</hi> holding another, and juſt ready
to Crown him. Behind <hi>Glory</hi> appear'd <hi>Piety</hi>
and <hi>Mildneſs,</hi> who was buſy'd in ſhutting the
Temple of <hi>Janus.</hi> On the other ſide was
<hi>Fame</hi> diſplaying the Banner held by <hi>Victory,</hi>
to expoſe the Hiſtory of thoſe Actions to
be read which ſhe had already publiſh'd
with her Trumpet. Below, <hi>Philoſophy</hi> was
repreſented by a venerable Woman, to
whom <hi>Nature</hi> imparted all her Secrets: <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
appear'd under the Figure of another
Woman, crown'd with the <hi>Zodiac,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
with a Lion for the Symbole of
Fire; Fruits and fruitful Animals, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Water; and a Vultur devouring a Bird,
to ſignifie the perpetual Round of Things,
which Nature re-produces by their Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
All theſe Figures ſeem to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd
and diſcover'd to the Spectator by
a Flambeau, held by the <hi>Love of Wiſdom,</hi>
who ſhew'd the King the Beauties of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,</hi>
and diſplay'd her Mantle, the Folds of
which were as ſo many Steps to aſcend to
the Top or Perfection of Wiſdom: And
the ſame Love repreſented the <hi>Genius</hi> of
him who defended the <hi>Theſes.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1681"/> 
               <hi>Colbert</hi> continu'd ſtill to apply himſelf with
a great deal of Induſtry and Diligence to the
management of Naval Affairs: And in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of that Deſign, he employ'd ſome
Perſons at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> under the inſpection of
the Chevalier <hi>de Tourville,</hi> now Mareſchal
of <hi>France,</hi> to build a Frigat after a new
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51877:90"/>
Contrivance, which reſembl'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
way of Building, but was thought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
it, both with reſpect to the Materials,
and the Frame of the Veſſel, to make her
carry her Sails well, and render her Light,
tho' ſhe were loaded with a great number
of Guns. This Frigat being only thirty
Foot in the Keel, cou'd nevertheleſs carry
ſixty Guns; and if that Deſign ſhou'd be
brought to perfection, as it afterwards was,
'twas reſolv'd that ſhe ſhou'd ſerve as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
for the Future. This Undertaking was
attended with extraordinary Succeſs; and
Trade encreas'd ſo faſt, that in the Year
1681, the Town of St. <hi>Malo</hi> alone ſet forth in
one Month ſixty five well-rigg'd Ships, the
leaſt of 'em being of 150 Tun, for the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhery
of Cods at <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> without
reckoning thoſe that were employ'd in the
<hi>Levant, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade, beſides
ten that were on the Stocks. St. <hi>Malo</hi> is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Town in <hi>Bretaign;</hi> its Situation is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,
by reaſon of the Rock on which
'tis built; and the Inhabitants are entruſted
with the Guard of the City, as a Privilege
due to their unſhaken Loyalty. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Trade was not the only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Care and Application; for
he made his Majeſty's Arms as terrible at
Sea, as they were already at Land. To
make the Reader ſenſible of the Truth
of this Aſſertion, 'twill be ſufficient
to put him in mind of the Duke of
<hi>Mortemar</hi>'s Expedition with his Majeſty's
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51877:90"/>
Galleys in <hi>June</hi> 1681. No ſooner did he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before <hi>Majorca,</hi> but the Pyrates of that
Iſland deliver'd all their <hi>French</hi> Priſoners,
according to the Liſt drawn up by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and gave Money for
thoſe that cou'd not be found. Then the
General returning to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> left the ten
Galleys that were under his command, and
immediately put to Sea again with a like
number of others. He gave Chaſe to the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
and having ſecur'd the Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> was returning
from <hi>Corſica</hi> to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> when before <hi>Leghorn</hi>
he fell in with a Fleet of 9 <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant-Ships,
from 25 to 40 Guns each, under the
Convoy of two Men of War of 60 Guns, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Count of <hi>Stirum,</hi> Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of <hi>Holland,</hi> who refuſing to ſalute the
<hi>Reale,</hi> the Duke reſolv'd to bring him to
reaſon; and having ſecur'd the Advantage
of the Wind of all the Ships in the Road,
he order'd his Men to take breath (who
had row'd all the way from <hi>Porto-Ferrato</hi>
to <hi>Leghorn)</hi> that they might be afterwards
in a condition to attack and burn the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
and drive 'em foul of each other.
But the Execution of his Deſign was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the Arrival of the Captain of
the Port in a Felucca from the City, with
advice that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were reſolv'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply:
And after ſeveral Meſſages, 'twas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
that the Count of <hi>Stirum</hi> ſhou'd ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
the <hi>Reale</hi> with nine Guns, and only be
anſwer'd with two, which was accordingly
executed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:51877:91"/>
The Terror of the King's Flags was not
confin'd to the <hi>Mediterranean:</hi> The Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
<hi>de Bethune,</hi> Captain of a Frigat call'd
the <hi>Mutine,</hi> ſet ſail from <hi>Port-Lewis,</hi> on the
<hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> to rejoyn the Chevalier <hi>de
Château-Regnaut,</hi> and rang'd the Coaſt to the
Road of <hi>Caſcais,</hi> about ſeven Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where he anchor'd <hi>July</hi> 1,
and the next Day ſet ſail again, on ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
that Captain <hi>Bart,</hi> Commander of two
<hi>Dunkirk</hi> Frigats, had taken a Veſſel belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Pyrates of <hi>Salley;</hi> and that there
was another of 16 Guns on the Coaſt of
<hi>Portugal.</hi> The Veſſel which <hi>Bart</hi> forc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
was mann'd with 103 <hi>Moors,</hi> who
eſcap'd to Land, but were afterwards deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
up to him by the Orders of the Prince-Regent:
The Nephew of the Governour of

Perſons of that City, were found among
the Priſoners; and eighteen <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were
ſet at liberty. The Chevalier <hi>de Bethune</hi>
being inform'd of that Action, cruis'd on
the Coaſt of <hi>Portugal</hi> till the fourth of the
ſame Month, when about ten a-clock in the
Morning, he deſcry'd a Ship at the height
of 40 Degrees, five or ſix Leagues South-South-Weſt
of the <hi>Berlingues.</hi> He chas'd her
till eight at Night, when being too near
the Shore, he gave Orders to tack about for
Sea-room: Next Morning about half an
Hour after four, he perceiv'd the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſailing cloſe by the Shore, in Chaſe of
a <hi>Portugueſe Caravelle,</hi> whom ſhe left when
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51877:91"/>
ſhe ſaw the <hi>Mutine</hi> ſtand in after her, and
endeavour'd to eſcape; but finding that ſhe
cou'd not otherwiſe avoid fighting, ſhe choſe
rather to run a-ſhore about half an Hour
after two a-clock in the Afternoon. Before
ſhe took that Reſolution, ſhe fir'd ten or
twelve Shot, without reaching the Frigat;
and then tack'd towards the Shore, five
Leagues South (declining a little towards
the Weſt) of <hi>Montaign.</hi> Aſſoon as the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
ſtruck a-ground, all the Men leap'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-board
except eighteen <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whom
they had taken and made Slaves. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
the Frigat caſt Anchor in ſeven Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
Water, and <hi>Denoy,</hi> one of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
with ſix or ſeven Soldiers of the
Marine Guard, went in the Boat to ſee
whether there were any <hi>Turks</hi> in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel;
where they learn'd that there were 125
of 'em, and that they had all made their
eſcape. After the Boat went off from the
Frigat, the Baron <hi>des Adrets,</hi> Lieutenant, the
Chevalier <hi>de Blenac,</hi> Enſign, and the Chevali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>de la Barre,</hi> with ſome Soldiers, mann'd
the Pinnace, and ſtood away to join <hi>Denoy,</hi>
whom they found on board the Pyrate.
Then they began to conſider whether the
Veſſel cou'd be gotten off, but the Sea
was ſo high, and ſhe had receiv'd ſo violent
a Shock, that they quickly loſt all hope of
ſaving her. Finding none but <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in
the Veſſel, the Baron <hi>des Adrets,</hi> and the
<hi>Chevalier de Blenac,</hi> with ſome Soldiers of the
Marine Guard, went a-ſhore in purſuit of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51877:92"/>
the <hi>Turks,</hi> if perhaps they cou'd meet with
any of 'em ſtraggling: And in the mean
time <hi>Denoy,</hi> and the <hi>Chevalier de la Barre</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to ſet Fire to the Ship; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they cou'd not compaſs their Deſign,
the <hi>Chevalier</hi> went back in the Pinnace
with ten <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> to the Frigat, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
with the Maſter-Gunner to burn the
Ship with artificial Fire-Works; but ſhe was
ſo over-ſet, that 'twas impoſſible to get on
board; and immediately after ſhe was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to pieces with ſo much Violence, that
nothing but her Flags cou'd be ſav'd. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy</hi>
and ſix or ſeven more, who were with
him in the Veſſel, leap'd over-board, and
got to the Shore; and the <hi>Chevalier de la
Barre</hi> finding that he cou'd not approach ſo
near as to take 'em in, return'd with the
Pinnace to the Frigat. Two Days after, the
<hi>Chevalier de la Bethune</hi> went to <hi>D. Pedro,</hi> the
Prince-Regent, now King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to
demand the <hi>Turks</hi> who had thrown their
Arms into the Sea, and made their eſcape
a-ſhore: His Requeſt was granted, and the
Infidels were deliver'd to him. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>du Quêne,</hi> Lieutenant-General of his
Majeſty's Armies, chas'd ſome <hi>Tripolin</hi> Pyrates
into the Port of <hi>Chio,</hi> where he Cannona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
'em, and almoſt quite deſtroy'd the
Fortreſs, becauſe it fir'd ſome Guns at the
Fleet under his Command. The Pyrates
offer'd to buy their Peace at the rate of 300
<hi>French</hi> Slaves, to be reſtor'd without Ranſom,
and were at laſt conſtrain'd to deliver 'em
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51877:92"/>
all to the Marqueſs. 'Twas ſtipulated by
the Treaty with the Divan of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> that
all the <hi>French</hi> that were to be found in

de Vauburgh,</hi> Brother to the Intendant and
Abbot of that Name: for to recompenſe the
care he took to eaſe him in the Diſcharge of
his Miniſtry, he bought for him one of the
Places of <hi>Maſter of Requeſts,</hi> vacant by the
Death of <hi>Peter Forcoal. Deſmarets</hi> was, by
his Uncle's Intereſt, admitted to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of that Office, tho' he was not above
25 Years old, as he had already been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

the other was marry'd to <hi>Andrew Jubert de

On the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1681. the King
came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and viſited the Orchard or
Nurſery of Fruit-Trees for the Uſe of the
Royal Houſes; from whence he went to the
<hi>Louvre,</hi> where he ſaw his Cabinet of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and from thence to his Library in the
Street <hi>Vivienne,</hi> where the Coadjutor of
<hi>Rohan</hi> ſhew'd him the moſt curious Books,
and the Cabinet of Ancient and Modern
Medals, and engrav'd Agats. His Majeſty
went alſo to the Academy of Sciences, the
Chymical Laboratory, and the Rolling-Preſs
for Prints, and expreſſed a great deal of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
at the Sight of ſo many Marks of
<hi>Colbert</hi>'s Diligence in ordering all things that
were committed to his Care. At the ſame
the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> went to <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to
be preſent at the Tryal of ſome newly-invented
Machines, the Succeſs of which
gave a fair Proſpect of great Advantages in
time of War. The Frigat call'd <hi>Echole</hi> was
ſet apart by his Order for the Inſtruction of
the young Officers of his Majeſty's Ships and
the Marine Guards, and diſarm'd by the
<hi>Chevaler le Bret</hi> of <hi>Flacourt,</hi> who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her, and cruis'd ſix Weeks on the
Coaſt about <hi>Rochefort.</hi> And the ſame Officer
was made Captain of the Marine Guards on
that ſide.</p>
            <p>The Terrour which the King's Galleys had
ſpread over all the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> occaſion'd an
Embaſſy to his Majeſty from <hi>Mula Iſmael,</hi>
King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and Brother of <hi>Muley Axid,</hi>
who was called King of <hi>Tafilet.</hi> That Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51877:94"/>
is of a conſiderable Extent, being part of
the ancient <hi>Numidia,</hi> at preſent call'd <hi>Bile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgerit,</hi>
and is ſituated between <hi>Fez</hi> and the
<hi>Mediterranean.</hi> The above-mention'd King
of <hi>Tafilet,</hi> who was one of the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
in <hi>Afric,</hi> as he was one day ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
his Horſe, ſtruck his Head againſt the
Branch of a Fig-Tree, and receiv'd a mortal
Blow, of which he died ſome days after;
tho' others ſay he was poiſon'd by one of
his Concubines. But whatever was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his Death, 'tis certain that when he
felt it approaching, he deliver'd his Sword as
the Badge of Royalty to his Brother <hi>Mula Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi>
telling him that his two Sons, (the
Eldeſt of whom was but 4, and the other
3 Years old) were incapable of ſuſtaining
the Weight of a Crown; and that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
that all the Countries he had conquer'd
wou'd revolt after his Death. Nor was he
miſtaken in his Prediction; for the People
took Arms; and <hi>Mula</hi> at the Head of the
<hi>Negro's</hi> and ſome other Troops, was oblig'd
to re-conquer the Kingdoms of <hi>Fez</hi> and
<hi>Morocco,</hi> the Principalities of <hi>Tetuan, Salley,</hi>
and <hi>Arcaſſa,</hi> and a Part of the Kingdom of
<hi>Sus.</hi> His Subjects are compos'd of ſeveral
Nations, of which I ſhall only name ſome
of the moſt remarkable. The Cities are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by the <hi>Moors,</hi> who are the Poſterity
of the ancient <hi>Saracens.</hi> The <hi>Barbarians</hi> live
in houſes conver'd with Stubble, on the vaſt
Mountains of <hi>Atlas,</hi> which croſs the whole
Country. The <hi>Alarbs</hi> or <hi>Arabs</hi> poſſeſs the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51877:94"/>
Plains, and are divided into Tribes: The
Head or Oldeſt Man of a Family, is the
Commander, and is call'd the <hi>Checq</hi> or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
They paſs their whole Life in Tents
made of Wooll and Goat's Hair, and the
Plains are ſtrew'd with their <hi>Adoüards,</hi> which
are a ſort of Hamlets, conſiſting of 40 or 50
Tents, ſet up together in a round Figure:
and ſome of the moſt numerous Tribes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
50 <hi>Adoüards.</hi> To all the Conqueſts I
have already mention'd, <hi>Mula Iſmael</hi> added
that of <hi>Mammora</hi> on the Ocean, which he
took from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and of <hi>Tangier,</hi> the
<hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Mauritania Tingitana,</hi> which the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were forc'd to abandon. He is of
the Race of <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſurnam'd <hi>Cherif,</hi> whoſe
Name he bears in his Signet in the <hi>Arabic</hi>
Tongue, together with that of the <hi>Saviour
of the World,</hi> whom the <hi>Moors</hi> call <hi>Cydy Nayſſa,</hi>
but only acknowledge that he was a great
Prophet. In the ſame Signet is the Name of
<hi>GOD,</hi> and of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Author of their
Religion: for all other Coats of Arms are
forbidden by their Law, which expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
all ſorts of Figures. They pretend to
be the only Profeſſors of the true <hi>Mahometan</hi>
Religion, and affirm that 'twas begun by
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom they make the Firſt of all the
<hi>Moors,</hi> and the Inventer of their uſual Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.
They wear neither Gold, Silver, nor
Silk, and are only cloath'd with a Piece of
Stuff, wrapp'd two or three times about their
Body, and leaving their Arms and Legs bare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
They call this Garment a <hi>Hocque,</hi> and it
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51877:95"/>
ought always to be made of <hi>White Stuff.</hi> Nor
are they leſs Religious Obſervers of that Part
of their Law which contains Regulations
about Meat, for they eat no Fleſh but of
ſuch Beaſts as are kill'd by Perſons of their
own Sect. He who ſupplies the place of a
Butcher, preſents the Animal with its Throat
towards <hi>Mecca,</hi> ſaying, <hi>My God, behold a
Victim which I am going to ſacrifice to thee, I
pray thee that our Eating of it may be for thy
Glory,</hi> and then cuts its Throat. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their <hi>Sala</hi> or Devotion, exactly five
times every Day: firſt they waſh their Feet
and Legs up to the Knees, and their Hands
and Arms to the Elbows; then ſeating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on the Ground, with their Face turn'd
<hi>Eaſt-ward,</hi> they invoke their <hi>Cydy Mahomet,</hi>
and afterwards <hi>Cydy Bellabec,</hi> (whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
to be St. <hi>Auguſtin)</hi> and ſeveral others.
Among their Saints they reckon alſo <hi>Cydy
Nayſſa,</hi> for ſo they call the Saviour of the
World, who, they believe was born of a
<hi>Virgin,</hi> and conceiv'd by the <hi>Breath</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi>
but they cannot comprehend that <hi>Breath</hi> to
be the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and conſequently that there
are <hi>Three Perſons</hi> who are <hi>One God. Mula Iſmael</hi>
perceiving that the Squadron of ſix Ships
commanded by the <hi>Chevalier de Château-Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naut,</hi>
had quite ruin'd the Trade of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by lying before his Ports, reſolv'd to ſend
an Ambaſſadour to his Majeſty; and gave
that Commiſſion to <hi>Hagdi Mehemed Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Tetuan,</hi> who embark'd on
the Veſſel commanded by <hi>la Barre</hi> in <hi>Château-Regnaut</hi>'s
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51877:95"/>
Squadron, and arriv'd at <hi>Breſt,</hi>
where he ſtay'd for his Majeſty's Orders, who
was then at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and came afterwards
to <hi>Paris,</hi> by the way of <hi>Vannes, Nantes, Angers,
Saumur, Blois,</hi> and <hi>Orleans.</hi> His Wit was
every-where admir'd, and convinc'd thoſe
who convers'd with him, that he was Maſter
of all that Politeneſs for which the ancient
<hi>Moors</hi> were famous. In every Town thro'
which he paſs'd, he made a Queen and an
Ambaſſadreſs: One day a Lady, whom he
had honour'd with the firſt of theſe Titles,
ſeem'd to be jealous, and complain'd, that
She whom he call'd Ambaſſadreſs engroſs'd
all his Eloquence and Kindneſs: <hi>You are
Queen,</hi> reply'd he immediately, <hi>and my Duty
is to admire you in Silence;</hi> after which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
his Diſcourſe with the Ambaſſadreſs.
Another Lady blaming the Cuſtom of his
Country Men who take a great Number of
Wives. <hi>If our Women were as handſome as
you,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>we wou'd never marry more
than one.</hi> After the King had granted him
Audience, <hi>Colbert de Croiſſy,</hi> Secretary of State,
and the Marqueſs of <hi>Seignelay</hi> were appointed
to hear his Popoſals. At laſt he concluded a
Treaty for Commerce, and left <hi>France,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
pleas'd with the Country, and
charm'd with his Majeſty's Grandeur.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1682"/> We have already ſeen with what Zeal <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
apply'd himſelf to the Advancement of
ſome of his Relations; and he was not leſs
mindful of his Brother <hi>Edward-Francis.</hi> In the
Year 1658, he marry'd him to <hi>Mary-Magdalen
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51877:96"/>
Bautru,</hi> Daughter to the Count of <hi>Serran,</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the
King's Brother, and made him buy the County
of <hi>Maulevrier.</hi> He procur'd him to be made
Captain-Lieutenant of the Second Company
of his Majeſty's Muſquetiers, <hi>Maréchal de
Camp,</hi> and afterwards Lieutenant-General;
and at laſt obtain'd for him the Government
of <hi>Tournay,</hi> in <hi>May 1682. Tournay</hi> is a very
ſtrong Place, defended by a Caſtle, which is
ſaid to have been built by the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> 'tis ſeated
on the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and is the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of a little
Territory call'd <hi>Tournaiſis.</hi> Beſides the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral-Church
of <hi>Nôtre-Dame,</hi> which is a very
fine Structure; it contains Ten Pariſhes, Two
Abbeys, and ſeveral other Religious Houſes.
In the Year 1521. the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V.
took it from the <hi>French,</hi> who had ſeiz'd it
Three Years before: It was again conquer'd
by his Majeſty in 1667. and yielded to him
by the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> as I intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before. This City is very ancient, and
its <hi>Biſhop</hi> is a <hi>Suffragan</hi> of the Archbiſhop of
<hi>Cambray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inſolence of the Pyrates of <hi>Algier,</hi>
who wou'd not be taught Wiſdom by the
Example of thoſe of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> provok'd the
King to ſend thither the Marqueſs <hi>du Quêne</hi>
with his Squadron. He ſail'd from the Port
of <hi>Thoulon, July</hi> 12. 1682. on the <hi>18th.</hi> he
join'd the Galleys that expected him at <hi>Yvica;</hi>
and on the 23. anchor'd before <hi>Algier,</hi> where
the Galleys ſtopp'd a Bark they had taken
by the way, which was bound with Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51877:96"/>
for the City. The Marqueſs <hi>du Quêne</hi>
was join'd in the Road by ſome Men of War
and Bomb-Veſſels; ſo that the whole Fleet
conſiſted of 15 Galleys, 11 Men of War,
5 Bomb-Veſſels, 2 Fire-Ships, and 3 arm'd
Barks, beſides Tenders and other Veſſels la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with Ammunition. The Coaſt of <hi>Afric</hi>
makes a crooked Line in this place, and
forms the Bay of <hi>Algier;</hi> the City is built
on that part of the Shore that reaches from
<hi>South</hi> to <hi>North,</hi> and looks towards the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
Its Situation on the Brow of a Hill yields a
very pleaſant Proſpect to thoſe who are at
Sea; for they have a full view of all the
Houſes which are roof'd with <hi>Terraſſes</hi> and
whited without. 'Tis defended with ſtrong
Walls, and ſeveral irregular Works all of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Figures: beſides, there is a Caſtle in the
higheſt part of the City, and on the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
which reach along the Shore there
are above 50 Pieces of Cannon mounted.
The Harbour is overagainſt the Middle of
the City, and cover'd on the Side next the
Sea with a little Iſland fortifi'd with ſeveral
Works, and about 50 Pieces of Cannon.
At the <hi>North</hi> End of the Iſland is the Watch-Tower,
furniſh'd with 27 Piece of Cannon
on three Batteries: On the <hi>North</hi> Sides the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is cover'd by a Mole that joins the Iſland
to the City, and ſhut up with a Chain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>South.</hi> About 1000 Paces without
the City on the <hi>North</hi> ſide, there is a little
Fort, call'd the <hi>Engliſhmens Fort,</hi> defended
by 10 or 12 Pieces of Cannon; and nearer
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51877:97"/>
the City is <hi>Fort Babaloüet</hi> with 15 Pieces of
Artillery. On the <hi>South</hi> ſide of the City
near the Shore, ſtands the Fort of <hi>Babaſſan,</hi>
where there are 10 or 12 great Guns; and
there is alſo another Fort on the top of the
Hill call'd the <hi>Emperour's Fort,</hi> from <hi>Charles</hi> V.
who encamp'd there at the time of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Expedition in 1541. Thus 'twas
impoſſible for the <hi>French</hi> to bombard <hi>Algier,</hi>
without expoſing themſelves to the Fire of
above 160 Pieces of Cannon, 80 of which
carry'd from 24 to 60 Pound Ball. All the
Forces of the State were in the City, and
all the Veſſels of the Pyrates, except one
Galley, left the Sea aſſoon as the King's Ships
appear'd, and got into the Harbour, where
they were diſarm'd, and the Chain drawn
up. Beſides the Road is very dangerous, and
peſter'd with a great number of Rocks: The
Currents that run there almoſt perpetually,
and the Eaſt, South-Eaſt, North, and North-Weſt
Winds, which uſually reign there,
make it very unſafe for Ships. But the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>du Quêne</hi> was ſo far from being deterr'd
from the Proſecution of his Deſign by the
diſcouraging Proſpect of ſo many Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that he only waited the Conveniency
of calm Weather to put it in execution. The
Galleys were to tow in the Ships and Bomb-Veſſels
within half Cannon-ſhot on the <hi>North</hi>
ſide of the City; and the greateſt part of
'em were to draw up in a Line in Figure of
a Half-Moon on the <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi> and the reſt
along the Shore to batter the <hi>Engliſhmens</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:51877:97"/>
Fort, and that of <hi>Babaloüet,</hi> while the former
play'd on the City. On the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi>
the Weather was calm, and immediately the
Marqueſs <hi>du Quêne</hi> gave Orders to prepare for
the Cannonading of the City. But the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
and Galliots had hardly weigh'd Anchor,
when there aroſe ſuch a freſh Gale, that
they were oblig'd to defer the Attempt: and
on the <hi>13th.</hi> there happen'd ſo violent a
Storm of Wind from the Weſt-South-Weſt,
accompany'd with Thunder, that they cou'd
not without a great deal of Difficulty, get
clear of the Shoar. The Marqueſs ſeeing the
Weather ſo rough, the Seaſon of the Year
ſo far advanc'd, and the Miſeries with which
the Galleys were threaten'd for want of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſent 'em back to <hi>France</hi> on the <hi>15th.</hi>
and after their departure reſolv'd to make
uſe of the Galliots to throw Bombs into the
City. And that they might ſtand in, and
come off without danger, he commanded
<hi>Forant,</hi> a Captain of a Ship, to cauſe five
Anchors to be let down on the North-Eaſt
ſide of the City, to which there were Cables
faſten'd of 1500 Fathoms in length, their
Ends being diſtributed among the Veſſels
call'd the <hi>Vigilant, Valiant, Prudent, Laurel,</hi>
and <hi>Star,</hi> commanded by the <hi>Chevalier de
Tourville,</hi> Lieutenant-General of the Navy,
Captain <hi>Beaulieu, Lery,</hi> Commander of the
Squadron, and the Captains, <hi>Forant</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile.</hi>
The firſt of theſe Officers was poſted
on the South, and the laſt on the North;
and the Cables were appointed for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51877:98"/>
of ſending in and bringing off the
Galliots or Bomb-Veſſels. While they were
executing theſe Orders, the <hi>Algerines</hi> fir'd
above a hundred Cannon-ſhot, of which
the Ship call'd the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> receiv'd one in
her Top-Maſt, and the <hi>Aſſuré,</hi> two under
Water, and one in her Sails. The <hi>22th.</hi> in
the Evening, the Weather proving fair,
with a perfect Calm, the Five Ships ſtood
in to come to an Anchor in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Poſts, and the Five Bomb-Veſſels
approach'd the Town till they were a-peak
of their Anchors; the <hi>Cruel,</hi> commanded
by <hi>Ponti,</hi> was poſted on the South, and after
her in order, the <hi>Menaçante,</hi> commanded
by <hi>Goetton,</hi> the <hi>Bombard</hi> by <hi>de Combe,</hi> on
which <hi>Comarin,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Bombardiers,</hi>
was embark'd; the <hi>Thunderer</hi> by <hi>du Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bier,</hi>
and the <hi>Brulante,</hi> by <hi>Beauſſier.</hi> When all
things were in a readineſs, and the Bomb-Veſſels
were moor'd without the leaſt oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the <hi>Algerines,</hi> they threw ſome
Bombs, to try the reach of the Mortars. But
'twas found by Experience that they were at
too great a diſtance, ſince few of the Bombs
reach'd the City; and therefore all the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
came to an Anchor the ſame night in their
uſual Poſts. Afterwards <hi>Lery</hi> and <hi>Bellile</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to carry the Anchors nearer the
Town; the firſt caus'd the Anchor of the
three firſt Bomb-Veſſels to be dropp'd on the
Eaſt ſide of the Harbour, and the ſecond
that of the two laſt on the North-Eaſt; tho'
during the Execution of that Attempt, the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51877:98"/>
Enemy made a continual Fire with Cannon
and Muſquet-ſhot. The <hi>30th.</hi> in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Weather proving fair, the Marqueſs
<hi>de Villefons, du Chalard,</hi> the <hi>Chevaliere d' Aire,</hi>
and ſeveral Officers of the Marine Guards,
beſides Voluntiers, went on board the Bomb-Veſſels
which ſtood in to their Poſts, and were
by the Marqueſs <hi>du Quêne</hi>'s Orders, ſupported
by two Arm'd Barks, ten Pinnaces, and the
Prize which he had order'd to be arm'd.
The Bomb-Veſſels being moor'd began to
throw their Bombs with very good Succeſs,
for in four hours they threw in 120, which
almoſt all reach'd the City. In the mean
time the Enemy made a continual Fire with
Muſquet-ſhot, for the ſpace of an hour,
without doing the leaſt Execution, becauſe
the Bomb-Veſſels were at too great a diſtance;
and beſides they fir'd 1000 or 1200 Cannon-ſhot,
taking their time to fire always when
the Bombs were diſcharg'd, that the Flaſhing
at the Touch-hole might ſerve 'em for a
Mark to level at. About two hours before
Day they were hal'd off, and there was not
one Man kill'd or wounded in the whole
Action. The Marqueſs <hi>du Quêne</hi> was not
long ignorant of the ſucceſsful Effects of the
Bombs, for the Approach of the Fleet gave
an opportunity to a conſiderable Number of
Slaves to make their Eſcape; and thoſe who
came off the Day after the Action, among
whom was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain, whoſe Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
was fixt at 6000 Crowns, related that
the Bombs had kill'd ſeveral Perſons, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51877:99"/>
thrown down a great Number of Houſes;
that one of the Bombs falling into the great
Moſque, where the People of the Town
were at Prayers, kill'd above 100 Perſons,
and ruin'd one ſide of the Building; that
the Town was in a great Conſternation; that
the Women and Children were ſent away;
that ſeveral <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> were retir'd to
the Fields, and that a conſiderable Party in
the Town had already declar'd for a Peace.
The Night between the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> of
<hi>September,</hi> the Bomb-Veſſels ſtood into their
former Poſts without any oppoſition, but they
had ſcarce thrown two Bombs, when they
begun to cry, <hi>A Galley, A Galley;</hi> and
the Alarm proving true, all things were put
in a fit Poſture to receive the Enemy. The
Galley follow'd by three Brigantines and ſome
Barks, advanc'd towards the neareſt Bomb-Veſſel
call'd the <hi>Cruel,</hi> on board of which
were <hi>Renard</hi> and <hi>Landouillet,</hi> Commiſſioners
of the Marine, and diſcharg'd a Broad-ſide of
Cannon and Muſquet-ſhot againſt her, which
kill'd only one Soldier. In the mean time
the Marqueſs <hi>de la Porte</hi> had got into the
<hi>Cruel,</hi> and ſhe gave the Galley ſo warm a
Return with her Muſquets and great Guns
charg'd with Small-ſhot, that ſhe ſtood off
to attack the ſecond Bomb-Veſſel call'd the
<hi>Menaçante,</hi> where ſhe thought to meet with
leſs Reſiſtance. Immediately <hi>Beaulieu,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the <hi>Valiant,</hi> who was order'd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that Veſſel, got on board with Major
<hi>Raymundis</hi> and the <hi>Chevalier de Comenge,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51877:99"/>
his Pindace under the Command of his
Lieutenant <hi>Iſarn de Monclair.</hi> The Muſquet-ſhot
on both Sides laſted about a Quarter of
an Hour, and the Patereroes and Cannons of
the Bomb-Veſſel play'd with very good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
<hi>Beaulieu</hi> himſelf levell'd a Cannon ſo
exactly againſt the Galley, as ſhe was cloſing
with the <hi>Menaçante</hi> to board her, that he
cover'd the whole Veſſel with Small-ſhot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of broken Pieces of Iron, kill'd and
wounded a great number of her Men, and
ſo ſhatter'd her, that ſhe bore away as faſt
as ſhe cou'd, without once tacking about.
And ſhe was even in ſo great a Diſorder,
that if the Bomb-Veſſels cou'd have follow'd
her, ſhe might have been eaſily taken. She
had not yet enter'd the Port, when the
Bombs began to flie at the Town, which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much ſurpriz'd the Enemy, who conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that their Galley had at leaſt brought off
two of the Bomb-Veſſels. They left off
ſhooting till their Galley was got into the
Harbour; but aſſoon as they ſaw her ſafe,
they began to ſhoot from their Batteries, and
fir'd five or ſix hundred Cannon-ſhot. This
Night there were almoſt eighty Bombs
thrown into the City, with no leſs Succeſs
than before: In the coming off, <hi>du Herbier</hi>
receiv'd a Cannon-ſhot in his Poop, which
burſt one of his Guns, kill'd ſix Men, and
wounded two: but in the whole Action there
were only fourteen Men kill'd, beſides ſome
that were wounded. The next Day, being
the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Algerines</hi> ſent to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51877:100"/>
the Admiral to deſire a Peace: The Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>le Vacher</hi> was entruſted with that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
who before the Rupture executed
the Office of Conſul of the <hi>French</hi> Nation
in that City. He deliver'd his Meſſage
from the <hi>Divan,</hi> who had order'd him to
deſire a Ceſſation, and that ſome Perſon
might be ſent to treat of the Conditions
of a Peace: To which the Marqueſs <hi>du
Quêne</hi> made anſwer, That if they had any
Propoſals to make, he wou'd hear 'em on
board his Ship, and that he was reſolv'd to
continue the Bombarding, and all other acts
of Hoſtility againſt 'em, 'till they grew ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and were willing to ſubmit to reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Conditions. <hi>Le Vacher</hi> added, that the
Bombs had ruin'd above one hundred Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and kill'd above ſeven hundred Men;
that ſeveral others were buried under the
Ruines; and that the Shore was cover'd
with dead Bodies, which were order'd to
be laid there by the <hi>Dey, Baba Haſſan,</hi> leaſt,
if they were brought into the City, the
ſight of 'em ſhou'd cauſe an Inſurrection.
The ſame Day in the Evening about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Bombs were thrown in, which were
almoſt all levell'd at the Harbour with a
deſign to burn the Ships. One of the
Bombs ſunk a Bark; and another falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Veſſels, broke off a part of their
Keels. But the Seaſon of the Year being
far advanc'd, the Marqueſs <hi>du Quêne</hi> return'd
to <hi>Toulon,</hi> leaving <hi>Lery</hi> with the Ships com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by St. <hi>Aubin, Bellile,</hi> and <hi>Bellefontaine,</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:51877:100"/>
to cruiſe before <hi>Algiers,</hi> and curb the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Pyrates. Nor did they alone
diſturb the Commerce of thoſe Infidels;
for a Veſſel call'd the <hi>Regle,</hi> which they had
ſeiz'd near <hi>Maromas,</hi> was retaken by <hi>Forant,</hi>
Commander of one of his Majeſty's Ships.
They had ſold her to two <hi>Jews,</hi> who
mann'd her with <hi>Dutch</hi> Seamen, and ſent
her to <hi>Holland</hi> to be laden with War-like
Ammunition, and other Furniture for Ships.
In her Return ſhe joyn'd in Company with
a Fleet of thirty <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant Ships un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Convoy of three Men of War,
and arriv'd in ſight of <hi>Alicant</hi> about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
of <hi>November 1682. Forant</hi> and S. <hi>Aubin,</hi>
who were cruiſing in thoſe parts, had notice of
her Arrival, and ſent their Pinnaces to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her with ſome Seamen of S. <hi>Malo,</hi> who
found her ridingat Anchor between the Forts
of <hi>Alicant</hi> and the Fleet. The Night between
the 18 and <hi>19th.</hi> of the ſame <hi>Month,</hi> they mann'd
their two Pinnaces, and ſent 'em under the
command of <hi>Pallieres</hi> and <hi>Sainte Maure,</hi> with
Orders to ſeize on the Veſſel; which they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
very happily, and without Noiſe, and
tow'd her out thro' a Fleet of above fifty
Veſſels of divers Nations. The Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War ſent to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate
with <hi>Forant,</hi> complaining that he had
ſeiz'd on a Ship that carry'd the Colours
of the Republick, and was under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection:
But he reply'd, that the Veſſel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Algiers;</hi> that ſhe was
bound thither, and had neither a Protection,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51877:101"/>
nor Bill of Lading. Theſe Reaſons were
unanſwerable, and the Commanders permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Ship to be carry'd off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colbert,</hi> who neglected nothing that might
tend to the promoting of Trade, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
that that there were very fine Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in the Iſles of <hi>Antilles,</hi> communicated
that Advice to <hi>Coulon,</hi> Maſter of an Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in the <hi>Rue Ferou</hi> in the <hi>Fauxbourg S. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi>
who in compliance with ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
a Propoſal, ſent his Kinſmen, <hi>Pair,</hi>
and <hi>du Cornet,</hi> two of his Majeſty's Grooms,
to the Iſlands of <hi>Bonaire, Curaſſol,</hi> and <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi>
from whence they brought Horſes of
an admirable Beauty, and ſurprizing Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<hi>Gabaret,</hi> Commander of a Squadron,
was ſent to the <hi>Antilles</hi> with three Ships,
the <hi>Furious, Pearl,</hi> and <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> under the
command of the <hi>Chevalier d' Arbouville,
d' Amblimont,</hi> and <hi>Machaut:</hi> This Squadron
ſail'd from the River <hi>Charante,</hi> on the <hi>8th.</hi>
of <hi>May</hi> 1682, and anchor'd in the Road of
<hi>Rochel,</hi> at the Point call'd <hi>Chef de Bois,</hi> from
whence they ſet ſail on the <hi>25th.</hi> for <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinico,</hi>
where after forty Days ſailing, they
arriv'd on the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and anchor'd
at <hi>Fort-Royal,</hi> to ſalute the Marqueſs of <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi>
General of the Iſles. The <hi>Pearl</hi> ſailing
cloſe by the Shore to get the Advantage
of the Wind, touch'd on certain Rocks,
from which ſhe got clear by the help of
her Anchors; but tho' ſhe felt no dammage
at preſent, ſhe was afterwards ſenſible of the
ill Effects of that Accident. Next Day they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51877:101"/>
weigh'd Anchor, ſteering towards <hi>Fort S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
where they arriv'd betimes. This is a
conſiderable Place with reſpect to its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
but inferiour in ſtrength to <hi>Fort-Royal.
Martinico</hi> is the chief of all the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi>
Iſlands that are inhabited by the
<hi>French:</hi> 'Tis all over Mountainous, and full
of Wood, but extremely fertil in Sugar-Canes,
from which the Inhabitants draw
their principal Revenue. It produces good
Melons, and a moſt pleaſant kind of Fruit
call'd <hi>Anana;</hi> beſides ſeveral other ſorts of
Fruit, as Gogaves, Potato's, Banana's, and
Figs, which are different from thoſe of
<hi>France.</hi> The Squadron ſail'd from hence
on the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and arriv'd on the
<hi>17th.</hi> at <hi>Granada,</hi> an Iſland Inhabited by the
<hi>French</hi> and the Wild Natives, abounding
with Sugar-Canes, Tobacco, and Tortoiſes,
and defended by a Fort of no great ſtrength;
from whence they continu'd their Courſe
with a fore-wind to the Lee-ward (for the
Land ſtretches Weſterly, and the Eaſtern
Winds reign perpetually in thoſe Seas)
and had ſo quick a Paſſage, that on the
<hi>24th.</hi> they deſcry'd <hi>Cape de la Velle</hi> in <hi>New-Spain,</hi>
and afterwards diſcover'd at a great
diſtance <hi>Mount St. Martha,</hi> call'd in that
Country <hi>Sierra Neuada,</hi> or the <hi>Snowy Hill,</hi>
which is the higheſt Mountain in the
World. It lies in the <hi>Torrid-Zone,</hi> in the
303 Degree of Longitude, and 8 of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
containing about thirty or forty Leagues
in circumference. 'Tis ſixty Leagues from
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51877:102"/>
the Sea, and yet may be diſtinctly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from <hi>Cape S. Tiberin</hi> in <hi>Dominico,</hi> at the
diſtance of 150 Leagues. Its perpendicular
height from the top to the level of the Sea,
is reckon'd to amount to two Leagues,
tho' Geographers affirm, that there is not
a Hill in the World half ſo high: But the
Snow that covers its top, notwithſtanding
the exceſſive heat of the Climate, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Proof of the Truth of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
Its Foot, and part of its Sides
are inhabited by People of a very low Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who may paſs for the <hi>Pigmies</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
by <hi>Pliny.</hi> They never venture their
little Bodies beyond the Confines of their
own Territory, nor entertain any corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
with their Neighbours; for the
ſight of a Man of ordinary Stature puts
'em to flight, and they run into their Holes
at his approach. During the exceſſive Heats,
they leave their uſual Habitations, and live
higher up in the Mountain; but aſſoon as
the Weather begins to grow Cold, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their former Abodes. They live on
a ſort of Grain of which they make both
Bread and Drink; and their <hi>Ouicou,</hi> or Drink
is alſo made of the Root of a Shrub, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have preſs'd out the poiſonous Juice.
Their Religion is only known to themſelves,
and never any Traveller cou'd hitherto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover
its Nature. On the <hi>26th.</hi> the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
rode an hour or two before <hi>Cartage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
bringing the Ships to a Lee without
Cannon-ſhot of the Town, which is ſeated
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51877:102"/>
in a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> the Harbour being on one
of the Sides. 'Tis a City of indifferent big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and its Figure is as irregular as its
Fortifications: 'Tis commanded by a riſing
Ground, where there is a Fort flank'd with
four Baſtions lin'd with Earth. It ſtands in
300. Degrees of Longitude, and 10 Degrees,
30 Minutes of North-Latitude. On the
<hi>29th.</hi> they ſet ſail to diſcover the Coaſt of
<hi>Nombre di Dios,</hi> and the ſame Day anchor'd
before <hi>Portobelo.</hi> This is a little, but very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
City, and one of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
places of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi>
both for the Advantage of its Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and the conveniency of its Situation:
For 'tis but eighteen Leagues diſtant from
<hi>Panama,</hi> where all the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Riches are
unladed, to be afterwards tranſported on
Mules to <hi>Portobelo,</hi> where they are embark'd
for <hi>Havana,</hi> and from thence carry'd to
<hi>Spain.</hi> The Harbour is very large and fair,
and ſo clear of Sands or Rocks, that there
is every where ſafe Anchorage for Ships of
the greateſt Burthen. When the <hi>French</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
arriv'd, there was a laden Ship in the
Port ready to Sail, under the Convoy of
a great Galeon, which cou'd not protect
her from the <hi>Bucaniers,</hi> who took her in her
Paſſage. 'Tis a ſurprizing Neglect of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they take no care to fortify
a place of ſo great importance; for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the Harbour is defended only by a
paltry Fort of a very irregular Figure, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
flank'd, and commanded by the Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51877:103"/>
at the Foot of which 'tis built. The
Town which is at the bottom of the Bay,
and appears not to thoſe who are at Sea,
till they come juſt before it, has no Walls,
and is only cover'd with two ſmall Works
on the above-mention'd Hillock. 'Tis alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
defenceleſs on the ſide next the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and on the other two ſides, by which
it communicates with the Land. The ſide
next the Sea is only flank'd with two ſmall
Baſtions, containing about nine Foot in the
Flank; and at the end of the Bay there
is a Redoubt about twelve <hi>Toiſes</hi> ſquare. I
have nothing more to add to this ſuccinct
Deſcription of <hi>Portobelo,</hi> but that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
pretend it will be quickly fortify'd with
a Cittadel of ſix Baſtions, between two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
half a Cannon-ſhot from the Forts.
The Squadron anchor'd near the Fort that
defends the Entrance into the Harbour,
where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> keep always a Guard,
which was doubled during the ſtay of the
<hi>French. Gabaret,</hi> to diſcover the Humours
and Inclinations of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after his Arrival, ſent <hi>Septeme,</hi> Major
of the Squadron, who having ſpoken with
the Commander of the Fort at the Entry,
was ſent forwards to the Governour. As
he drew near to the City in his Boat, with
his Colours diſplay'd, he was met by a Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours, which came to
receive him: And having had Audience of
the Governour, he return'd to give <hi>Gabaret</hi> an
account of his Negotiation. The Subject of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51877:103"/>
that Conference, and of thoſe that were
afterwards manag'd by other Deputies, was
never perfectly known: Only 'twas given
out that <hi>Septeme</hi> was ſent to enquire
after <hi>French</hi> Priſoners, and that he was told
there were none in the Town. Nevertheleſs,
the ſame Night very late, there came a
Man ſwimming to <hi>D' Amblimont</hi>'s Ship,
which rode next the Shore; and that Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
receiving him into his Boat, ſent him
immediately to <hi>Gabaret,</hi> whom he inform'd
that there were ſeventeen or eighteen <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
in the Town, but ſaid nothing of their
being Priſoners. Next Morning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
ſent to diſcover the Truth of what
he had learn'd, and to demand the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
of the Governour, who acknowledg'd
that there were ſome of that Nation in the
Town, who were not kept Priſoners, but
ſerv'd for Wages; adding, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
might, if he pleas'd, carry 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him; and accordingly thoſe rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
lean, and disfigur'd Creatures were
reſtor'd and diſtributed among the three
Ships. This Accident was not attended
with the leaſt diſorder; for the Affair
was tranſacted on both ſides in the moſt
amicable manner imaginable; and their
only Conteſt ſeem'd to be to out-ſtrip
each other in Civility. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
made the firſt ſtep, by ſending a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to <hi>Gabaret</hi> of two fat Oxen, <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Wine, Sweet-meats, Oranges, and Citrons;
and the <hi>French</hi> Officer in his turn preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51877:104"/>
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> with a Caſe of Piſtols, a
Caſtor, and other things of that Nature.
The Deputies of the Squadron were regal'd
on Shore, and thoſe that were ſent to the
Commander were treated on board his
Ship, where they drank ſeveral times to
the Health of the two Kings of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Spain</hi> with the uſual Ceremonies, making a
confus'd, but not unpleaſant, Noiſe, by ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Knife againſt a Plate. The place
where the <hi>French</hi> caſt Anchor at their firſt
coming into the Harbour being ſomewhat
incommodious, the Governour very civilly
ſent 'em a Pilot to bring 'em farther in,
to a place where they might Anchor more
ſafely. Two <hi>Armadilla's</hi> that were unrigg'd,
began to put themſelves in a poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
aſſoon as the Squadron appear'd, but
reſolv'd to ſtay in the Harbour. On the
Second of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>French</hi> left <hi>Portobelo,</hi>
and were by contrary Winds carry'd in ſight
of the <hi>Cattives,</hi> which are above fifty inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
Iſlands. On the <hi>11th.</hi> they made the
Iſle of <hi>Rotan,</hi> in the Gulf of <hi>Honduras,</hi>
which lies in 286 Degrees of Longitude,
and 16 of Latitude, and is only inhabited
by Pyrates, who land there for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of Refreſhment. Here the <hi>French</hi>
found a forſaken Ship, and concluded that
her Men were either taken, kill'd, or drown'd,
and that the Veſſel was a Prize, taken by
the <hi>Bucaneers</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a great number of Horſe-Shooes that
remain'd of her Cargo, there were ſeveral
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51877:104"/>
Jars of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, and Letters in that
Language, by which it appear'd that ſhe ſet
out in <hi>June,</hi> and conſequently that ſhe had
been taken not long before. The <hi>13th.</hi> they
diſcover'd a ſmall Pyrate cruiſing about that
part, and wou'd have chas'd him, if the
Booty cou'd have made amends for their
trouble; for he wou'd not come near the
Squadron, tho' the uſual Signal by the firing
of a Gun was made for him to approach.
The Paſſage from <hi>Portobelo</hi> to <hi>Rotan</hi> is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
by reaſon of the Banks of Sand with
which thoſe Seas are peſter'd; and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is ſo ſhallow, that the Pilots are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
puzzl'd to find the Chanel. The <hi>25th.</hi>
they made the Iſle <hi>des Pans,</hi> and the Capes
of <hi>Las Corrientes,</hi> and <hi>Sant-Anton,</hi> at the
Weſtern end of the Iſland of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and
were oblig'd to wait ſeveral Days for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Wind, before they cou'd double
the laſt of thoſe Capes. The <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
they paſt by <hi>Porto Cavano,</hi> in the ſame
Iſland; and on the <hi>6th.</hi> came before <hi>Hava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
which is the Metropolis of the Iſland,
and the uſual Reſidence of the Captain-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in improving the Fortifications of ſo
conſiderable a Place: for its Harbour is the
Rendezvous of all the Galeons that bring
the Silver from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and of all the
Ships that come from <hi>St. Martha, Cartagena,
Nombre de Dios, Portobelo, Vera Cruz, Campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſche,</hi>
and all the other Ports of <hi>Mexico.</hi> The
<hi>7th.</hi> they anchor'd at <hi>las Matanças</hi> in the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51877:105"/>
ſame Iſland, where they took notice of
the Comet that appear'd in <hi>France,</hi> and
was illuſtrated with ſeveral Obſervations:
They perceiv'd it firſt in the Night between
the <hi>25th.</hi> and <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> its Head being
North-North-Eaſt, and its Tail South and
by Weſt. Here they ſtood into the Bay to
refreſh themſelves, and took in freſh Water,
Wood, Fleſh, Fiſh, and all other neceſſary
Proviſions. The Bay is large, but not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-where
fit for Anchorage; nor is that its
only Inconveniency, for tis wholly deſtitute
of Inhabitants; but thoſe Defects are in
ſome meaſure ſupply'd by the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of all ſorts of Game, as Wild Oxen,
Herons, Parrots, and a prodigious Number
of other Fowls that are ſit to be eaten. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other Animals, there are certain Rats
much larger and thicker than our Cats,
that ſit on Trees along the Rivers, and are
not ſcar'd at the ſight of the Hunters.
And for the Refreſhment of thoſe whoſe
Stomachs are diſorder'd after a tedious Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
there is a ſort of <hi>Colewort</hi> that grows on
the top of a very ſpongy Stem, from thirty to
fifty Foot high, and may be eaten ſeveral
ways, as in Sallads, Broth or Pottage. The
Bay abounds with excellent Fiſhes, and
thoſe who take the Diverſion of Fiſhing in
the Rivers that fall into it, may gather as
much <hi>Creſſes</hi> as they pleaſe, which is like
to that we have in <hi>Europe.</hi> And beſides all
thoſe Marks of the bounty of Nature that
appear in this place; it yields ſtore of Salt,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51877:105"/>
and produces ſeveral kinds of Fruits, among
which there are Plums call'd <hi>Mourbin,</hi> and
two ſorts of Grapes. This pleaſant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is, as I intimated before, a part of the
Iſland of <hi>Cuba,</hi> which, according to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of Geographers, contains 280
Leagues in length, and 40 in breadth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
between 289 and 300 Degrees of
Longitude, and from the 20 to the <hi>22d.</hi>
Degree of Latitude, its Northern ſide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
30 Leagues diſtant from the <hi>Tropic</hi> of
<hi>Cancer.</hi> On the <hi>19th.</hi> the <hi>French</hi> ſet Sail
from <hi>Matanças,</hi> ſtanding in to the Frith of
<hi>Bahama,</hi> where the North-Wind being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd
between the Coaſt of the Main-Land,
and that of the Iſlands, which bound
the Straight on both ſides, breaks forth with
ſo violent an impetuoſity, that the Ships
which are engag'd in this dangerous Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
run the hazard of being daſh'd to
pieces on one of the oppoſite Shores: And
beſides, the agitation of the Sea by thoſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous
Winds, is encreas'd by the Rapidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Currents, which are oftentimes
fatal to ſuch ſmall Veſſels as thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
this Squadron: Yet they had the good
fortune to eſcape the Danger of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
which is 60 Leagues long, and 25
broad, between 24 and 27 Degrees of
Latitude; and afterwards ſail'd along the
Coaſt of <hi>Florida,</hi> to the height of the <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudas,</hi>
where they met with a fair Wind
for <hi>Martinico,</hi> which they diſcover'd on the
<hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> and Anchor'd the <hi>26th.</hi> at
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51877:106"/>
               <hi>Fort S. Peter.</hi> The <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> they ſet
ſail for <hi>Granada,</hi> to bring the Governour
of that Iſland, who was <hi>Gabaret</hi>'s Brother,
with his Wife, to <hi>Martinico,</hi> where ſhe was
deſirous to Lie in. In their Paſſage they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry'd
a ſmall Skiff, and made towards it
by <hi>Gabaret</hi>'s Orders, who was extremely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at the ſight of four or five Wretches,
that cou'd hardly ſtir an Oar to approach
the Ship, being ſtarv'd, and quite ſpent with
Hunger, Thirſt, ill Weather, and the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Waves. At laſt he receiv'd 'em
on board, and learnt that they were <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen</hi>
of the Iſle of <hi>Tabago,</hi> where they
were ſo cruelly us'd, that in a Fit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
they reſolv'd to commit themſelves to
the leſs-dreaded fury of the Waves; and
that their ſmall ſtock of Proviſion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
five Days before they were taken up.
On the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>December, Gabaret</hi> arriv'd at
<hi>S. Chriſtopher,</hi> where he left the <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi>
and the next Day ſail'd for <hi>France,</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Courſe to the Port of <hi>Breſt,</hi> where
he landed.</p>
            <p>The favourable Treatment which <hi>Gabaret</hi>
receiv'd from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> was
a glorious Effect of his Maſter's Power: And
the kind reception of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador
at the Court of <hi>Morocco,</hi> is a convincing
Proof of the Awe and Reſpect with which
that great Monarch inſpires the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Nations. The Count of S. <hi>Amand</hi>
embark'd on the <hi>Valiant,</hi> a Ship of 60 Guns,
commanded by <hi>Beaulieu,</hi> and came before
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51877:106"/>
               <hi>Algier,</hi> where he was preſent at that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Action I have already deſcrib'd.
From thence he ſet ſail for <hi>Tetuan,</hi> where
he arriv'd on the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1682, and
ſent ſome Perſons a-ſhore in his Pinnace,
who were inform'd by the <hi>Turks</hi> that were
come to the Sea-ſide, that for two Months
they had been daily expecting the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador's
Arrival, and that they had Orders
to intreat him not to Land, till they had
heard from the Vice-Roy of the Province,
becauſe they cou'd not receive him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Dignity, during the abſence of
that <hi>Alcayd.</hi> The <hi>4th. Mehemed Thummin,</hi>
who was formerly Ambaſſador in <hi>France,</hi>
came on board, with the Lieutenant-Governour,
and the Commander. They
were ſaluted at their Entry with the firing
of eleven Guns, and conducted to the
Council-Chamber, where they were receiv'd
by the Count of S. <hi>Amand,</hi> accompany'd
with eight Officers of Ships, twelve of the
Marine Guards, and ſeveral Gentlemen.
After they had all taken their Places, the
Ambaſſador began the Diſcourſe with tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Mehemed Thummin,</hi> that at his return
from the Campaign in <hi>Chio,</hi> he had heard
of his being in <hi>France,</hi> and was a Witneſs
of the Univerſal Acknowledgments that
were paid to his Wit and Merit. <hi>Thummin</hi>
reply'd, that he was oblig'd for ſo flattering
a Compliment to that Candor which is ſo
natural to the <hi>French</hi> Nation: And thoſe
mutual Returns of Civility were continu'd
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51877:107"/>
for ſome time on both ſides. Then the
Ambaſſador took occaſion to Diſcourſe of
the King of <hi>Morocco</hi>'s Greatneſs, of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
and of the Titles of his Predeceſſors.
The <hi>Moors</hi> were very attentive to what
he ſaid on that Subject, extolling their Prince's
Valour, to whom they always gave the
Title of <hi>Emperour.</hi> After they had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
with a Collation, the Ambaſſador
ſhut himſelf up with 'em, making uſe of
<hi>la Croix</hi> for his Interpreter, with whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
he was very well ſatisfy'd. The
Conference laſted an Hour and a half, and
'twas ſo late before they came out, that
the <hi>Moors</hi> were forc'd to lie on board. They
order'd a clean Table-Cloth to be ſpread on
the Boards, and ſtepping upon it with their
bare Feet, began to pray, crying often <hi>Alla,
Alla,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>God;</hi> and kneeling thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
times in the ſpace of a quarter of an
Hour. They ſate upon their Heels, and
from time to time ſtretch'd themſelves on
their left Side; and after they had remain'd
a Moment in that Poſture, they ſtroak'd
their Forehead and Face with their Right-hand,
which is the Badge of their Religion,
as the Sign of the Croſs is of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
The next Day after Dinner, which was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Banquet of Fruits, they viſited <hi>la Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſoniere,</hi>
who conducted 'em to the Shore,
and at their Landing were ſaluted with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven
Guns. At the ſame time a Bark ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
under <hi>Algerine</hi> Colours, without a Skiff,
ſtanding into the Mouth of the River; ſhe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51877:107"/>
was known to belong to <hi>Salley,</hi> and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel laden with Cod-Fiſh.
The <hi>6th.</hi> the Ambaſſador wrote to <hi>Mehemed,</hi>
requiring Satisfaction for the Injury done
to his Nation; and was anſwer'd, that the
Maſter of the Bark was arreſted, and that
the Prize ſhou'd be reſtor'd. The <hi>7th.</hi> a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
was diſpatch'd to <hi>Tetuan,</hi> which is
ſituated two Leagues from the Shore, for
the <hi>French</hi> Conſul, who ſent word that he
cou'd not come without the Governour's
Permiſſion. The ſame Day <hi>Mehemed</hi> gave
the Ambaſſador notice that he had receiv'd
an Anſwer from the <hi>Alcayd,</hi> who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
him to carry his Son on board, and
therefore he entreated the Pinnace might
be ſent a-ſhore next Morning. His
deſire was granted, and the Pinnace
waited upon him at the time appointed;
but he was forc'd to embark alone, for the
Youth was afraid to venture on the Sea,
which happen'd at that time to be very
rough. In the mean time the <hi>Alcayd</hi>
wrote to the Ambaſſador, to congratulate
his Arrival, aſſuring him that he wou'd
come with all poſſible haſte to receive him,
and that the Emperour his Maſter had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to treat him with the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
The <hi>9th.</hi> ſeveral Boats came to the Ship
to Land the Ambaſſador's Retinue; and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemed</hi>
went on board to compliment him in
the Name of the <hi>Alcayd,</hi> who waited on
the Shore to receive him: But 'twas ſo late
that the Ambaſſador thought fit to put off
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51877:108"/>
his Landing till the next Day, aſſuring <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemed</hi>
(who reſolv'd to lie that Night on
board) that at Sun-riſing he wou'd give
Orders to ſalute the <hi>Alcayd</hi> with thirteen
Guns, and a triple diſcharge of Muſquet-ſhot;
and the ſame Evening he ſent two
Officers to compliment him. Next Morning
the promis'd Salutation was perform'd; and
after the Ambaſſador had heard Maſs, and
din'd with <hi>Mehemed,</hi> he embark'd with all his
Retinue, beſides ſeveral Officers of the Ship
and Marine Guards, and Landed about nine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clock.
He found the Shore lin'd with 400 Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers,
and was met by the <hi>Alcayd</hi> and his
Son, at the Head of 200 Horſe. At their
Meeting, he told that Officer, that he was
glad he had the good Fortune to enter the
Dominions of the Emperour of <hi>Morocco</hi> in
a place that was under his Government.
The <hi>Alcayd</hi> reply'd, That he was welcome,
He and all his Company, and enquir'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Health. He was cloath'd in
Yellow, with a little Cowl or Hood of the
ſame Colour on his Head, and a Lance of
the length of a Pike in his Right-hand.
One half of the Horſemen carry'd Lances,
and the other Fire-locks, which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd,
and were follow'd by a Volley
from the Infantry, Then the Squadron
broke, and ſome of 'em gallop'd along the
Shore, turning and managing their Horſes
with a conſiderable Dexterity. At the ſame
time the Ambaſſador was conducted by
<hi>Mehemed</hi> to the <hi>Alcayd</hi>'s Tent, where there
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51877:108"/>
was a large Table-Cloath ſpread on the
Ground, with an <hi>Indian</hi> Cloth, and a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlet
over all, of the ſame largeneſs. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon
as the Ambaſſador enter'd, he ſat down
on the Coverlet, and Cuſhions were brought
to the <hi>Alcayd:</hi> Then the Ambaſſador roſe
up, ſaying, that <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd
to ſit ſo low; but the <hi>Alcayd,</hi> who
knew his meaning, reply'd, that this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
was not to be made a Precedent, and
that he did not pretend to entertain him with
all the Ceremonies of a formal Reception;
in the mean time he order'd two Cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be laid one above another, and the
Ambaſſador ſate down upon 'em. After
they had diſcours'd a quarter of an Hour,
the Collation was brought in, conſiſting of
March-panes, which were taken out of a
Wicker-Basket, and laid upon a piece of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>-Leather
after the manner of a Table-Cloth,
adorn'd with ſome Cyphers: Then
they preſented Nuts and Raiſins, with
very white, but very bad, Bread. All the
Company drunk outof the ſame Pot or
Diſh, which was made of Wood in form of
a Porringer, and adorn'd on the out-ſide
with Silver-Gilt. The Banquet ended, they
mounted on Horſe-back, the Infantry march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Wings, and the Horſe in the
Front, who, as often as they met with plain
Fields, divided themſelves into two Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,
repreſenting the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> way of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Lances. Some of the braveſt of
'em broke out of their Ranks, and having
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51877:109"/>
darted their Lances into the oppoſite Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
gallop'd back to their own, with
ſome of the other Party at their Heels.
Then the whole Squadrons engag'd without
obſerving any Order, and after they had
fir'd, the Commander, who march'd in the
Front, fell back to the Rear, galloping, and
calling on his Men, whom he rally'd, and
put into Order: And ſometimes one of the
Squadrons kept their Ground, expecting the
Aſſault of the Enemy. They engag'd after
the ſame manner nine or ten times before
they reach'd the Town, where the <hi>French</hi>
arriv'd about four a-clock, and the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
was carry'd to a little and ill-furniſh'd,
but not unpleaſant, Houſe, which they told
him was the King's. There is a Baſon or
Pond ſurrounded with Orange-Trees before
the Gate; and the Garden is adorn'd with
ſeveral Arbours of Fruit-Trees. The <hi>Alcayd</hi>
ſent to inform the King of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's
Arrival, and receiv'd an Anſwer on
the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>November;</hi> but the bad Weather
which laſted till the <hi>14th.</hi> and the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador's
Indiſpoſition retarded his Journey for
ſome time. <hi>Mehemed</hi> brought the Horſes
that were prepar'd for him, magnifying the
Care he had taken to procure ſo great a
number: And when he was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
the <hi>Alcayd</hi> came to him on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and enquir'd whether he wanted any
thing; after which he went to the <hi>Alcayd</hi>'s
Houſe, and thank'd him for all his Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and that Officer not only return'd a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51877:109"/>
very obliging Anſwer, but offer'd the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
three or four Thouſand Crowns,
if he ſtood in need of ſuch a Summ. Then
the Company took Horſe, and the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers
who were at the Gate, ſaluted the
Ambaſſador, as he paſs<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by, with a Volley
of all their Muſquets. The firſt Village they
ſaw on the Road is call'd <hi>Dezutburg,</hi> where
the Lord of the Place accommodates all
Perſons with Lodgings <hi>gratis,</hi> and has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fed two hundred at one time. They
travell<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d till the <hi>14th.</hi> thro' a Mountainous
and almoſt uninhabited Country, where
there is no Water, but great abundance of
Partridges. The <hi>14th.</hi> they encamp'd near
<hi>Alcaza,</hi> where the Ambaſſador was compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the <hi>Alcayd,</hi> Brother to him of
<hi>Tetuan.</hi> He wore a large Robe or Gown
of black Velvet ſpangl'd with Gold, and
rode on a very fine Horſe, who was of a
large ſize for one of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently
harnaſs'd with red Velvet, adorn'd
with little Plates of Gold: Two Slaves held
the Reins of his Bridle, and there was a
great deal of maſſy Gold on the Head-Stall
and Throat-Band. He was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
with his Son, who was mounted on
a Horſe of the ſame kind; and his Train
conſiſted of 100 Horſe, and a like number
of Foot. After ſome mutual Compliments
he retir'd, wheeling, and managing his
Horſe, he and all his Horſemen, as his
Brother and his Company did at <hi>Tetuan.</hi>
The whole Journey to <hi>Salley</hi> was very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51877:110"/>
to the Ambaſſadour's Retinue; the
Ways were generally hard to be found, the
Meat was bad, and they were forc'd to keep
themſelves always in a Poſture of Defence,
both becauſe of the Robbers, who came very
near their Tents in the Night, and the Lions
with which that Country abounds. On the
<hi>20th.</hi> they were met by <hi>Midy Aly Manino,</hi>
Lieutenant of the Polity or Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Salley,</hi> and Brother of the <hi>Alcayd</hi> of
that City, where they arriv'd in the Evening,
and abode two days, their Tables being
much better furniſh'd than they were upon
the Road. The Ambaſſadour, according to
the uſual Cuſtom, receiv'd many Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Preſents of <hi>Paſſara, Dates,</hi> and
ſome <hi>Hens,</hi> and <hi>Sheep.</hi> The Inhabitants of
moſt of the Villages thro' which they paſs'd,
receiv'd 'em with loud Acclamations of Joy,
ſome of 'em ſhew'd their Dexterity in Leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Horſe-Races were never omitted.
They found neither Bridges nor Boats on the
Rivers, but were forc'd to paſs 'em on Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Bags ſtuff'd with Wind. Two Days
before they arriv'd in the Camp, they paſs'd
by a Place where there are 150 Wells or Pits,
call'd in the Map, <hi>Centum Putei,</hi> which are
of great uſe in a Country wholly deſtitute
of Water, but that which proceeds from
Rain, and is preſerv'd in thoſe Pits. The
<hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> they paſs'd by a paltry Fort,
where the Grand Vizier lay, having been
lately wounded with a Muſquet-ſhot by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Moor,</hi> who fled to <hi>Muly Hamet,</hi> King of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51877:110"/>
               <hi>Suz:</hi> and they obſerv'd a Guard of 150
Muſquetiers at the Gate. The <hi>10th.</hi> the King
ſent four Horſe-Men for the Ambaſſadour,
who immediately ſet forward, and arriv'd in
the Camp on the Day of the Great Feſtival
of the <hi>Bayran,</hi> which the <hi>Moors</hi> were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
with many Expreſſions of Joy, and
Sacrifices of Camels and Sheep. As the
<hi>French</hi> approach'd the Place of Sacrifices they
perceiv'd four Men mounted on Mules full of
little Bells, who were ſtain'd with the Blood of
Victims which they had ſacrific'd before the
King. All the <hi>Alcayds</hi> of the Kingdom are
oblig'd to be preſent at that Solemnity, and
that Monarch ſent to tell the Count of S.
<hi>Amand,</hi> that he might advance further and
take a nearer View of the Ceremonies. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon
as he approach'd, the King retir'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen,
and put himſelf at the Head of 2000
Horſe, with whom he attack'd a like Number
of others: the Engagement laſted 3 Hours,
and they fir'd their Muſquets charg'd with
Powder in one anothers Faces; after which
the King ſent an <hi>Alcayd</hi> to compliment the
Ambaſſador, and to acquaint him that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Solemnity of the Feſtival he cou'd
not give him Audience till the next Day.
Then the Ambaſſadour with his Train was
carry'd to a Place 50 Paces diſtant from the
Camp, where he was attended next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by an <hi>Alcayd,</hi> who conducted him to
the Audience. All the Company took Horſe,
and alighted when they drew near to the
King's Tent, who when he perceiv'd the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51877:111"/>
at the diſtance of 10 Paces, ſaid
to him thrice, <hi>Cayba,</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>You are
welcome.</hi> Then all the Ambaſſadour's Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
put on their Hats; and the King ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at their Boldneſs, broke forth into this
Expreſſion, That the <hi>French</hi> were not Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
like thoſe of other Nations: after which
preventing the Ambaſſadour he ſaid, That
he was glad to ſee him in good Health; that
the Country from whence he came was
much more remote than <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> that
he was reſolv'd to execute the Treaty of
Peace concluded by his Ambaſſadours; and
that the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> were always Religious
Obſervers of their Word. Then he enter'd
into a Diſcourſe concerning Religion, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>There was only One God, the Lord of all
things;</hi> and the Ambaſſadour anſwer'd, <hi>That
the Chriſtians were of the ſame Opinion.</hi> The
King reply'd, That what he ſaid was only in
obedience to the Precepts of his Religion,
which oblig'd him to adviſe all Men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Faith, which he believ'd
was the beſt: and the Ambaſſadour anſwer'd,
That he was extremely oblig'd to his Majeſty
for his kind Intentions; but that he was reſolv'd
never to forſake that Religion in which he
was educated. Then the King, inſiſting ſtill
on that Subject, ask'd the Reaſon, Why <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
believe that there is a <hi>God the Son:</hi> but
the Ambaſſador being perſuaded that 'twou'd
be in vain for him to return a Formal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
reply'd, That he cou'd not pretend
to ſo much Skill in Divinity, as to diſpute
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51877:111"/>
with his Majeſty about thoſe Controverſies.
He had prepar'd a Harangue, but the King
always interrupted him with asking Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and at laſt told him, That he was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Difference between the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>France</hi> and other Monarchs, who
do not govern by their own Authority. The
Ambaſſador reply'd, That 'twas very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
that two ſo great Emperours, who
agreed in their Opinions, and obſerv'd the
ſame Methods of Government, ſhou'd be
link'd together by the mutual Ties of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Friendſhip. Then he preſented his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Letter, enclos'd in a Caſe of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
brought from the <hi>Levant,</hi> embroider'd
with Gold and Silver, together with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
in <hi>Arabic</hi> Characters. The King
of <hi>Morocco</hi> receiv'd it ſmiling; and ſmelling
the Caſe as he open'd it, after he had admir'd
the Embroidery, he ask'd, whether they
dreſs'd Leather with Amber-griſe; and the
Ambaſſador anſwer'd, That he was wholly
ignorant of thoſe Matters. Then the King
call'd two <hi>Engliſh Renegado's,</hi> his Secretaries,
and order'd 'em to read and interpret the
<hi>French</hi> Letter, which he heard with a great
deal of Pleaſure, expreſſing his Satisfaction
by the Motions of his Head, and ſpent ſome
time in conſidering his Majeſty's Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Seal which was in a diſtinct Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
cut all around into the Figure of a Sun,
and enclos'd in the Letter. After which he
ſaid, that he knew very well that the King
was deſcended in a right Line from <hi>Heraclius,</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:51877:112"/>
and that never any Emperour before him,
had advanc'd the Glory of the <hi>French</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
to ſo great a Heighth. The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
anſwer'd, That he was not ignorant of
his Majeſty's Royal Deſcent, and that from
<hi>Aly,</hi> who marry'd the Daughter of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
all his Predeceſſors were the Off-ſpring
of Kings. The King reply'd, That he was
not of the Royal Family, but of the Race
of the Prophet, adding that he ſent into
<hi>France Agy-Aly Manino,</hi> who was of one of
the greateſt Families in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
<hi>Agy Mehemed Thummin,</hi> who paſs'd
for the Ambaſſador. The Count of S. <hi>Amand</hi>
was inform'd, that in the King of <hi>Morocco</hi>'s
Letter to his Majeſty, the Name of <hi>Mehemed
Thummin</hi> was put inſtead of <hi>Aly Manino,</hi> by
the Intereſt of his Patron, the <hi>Alcayd Timur,</hi>
who is the moſt powerful Subject in the
Kingdom. The Ambaſſadour in Anſwer
to the King's laſt Compliment aſſur'd his
Majeſty, that <hi>Mehemed Thummin</hi> was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
admir'd in <hi>France</hi> for his Politeneſs,
and Skill in the Management of State-Affairs.
Then they brought ſome Dates that were
newly gather'd, and the King invited the
Ambaſſador to eat; and after they had done
eating he mounted his Horſe, telling the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
that he was going to run with Lances,
and deſiring him to keep his Eye upon him.
Theſe Exerciſes laſted about two Hours, tho'
it rain'd all the while, after which he gave
Orders to retire. Not long after the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
were brought to him, conſiſting of two
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51877:112"/>
Fuſees very finely wrought, two Caſes of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols,
two large <hi>Pendulums</hi> for a Cloſet, two
dozen of Watches, twelve Pieces of Gold
<hi>Brocard,</hi> as many Pieces of very fine <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Cloth, and ſome Bottles embroider'd with
Gold, of the ſame Leather with the Letter
Caſe, which was brought from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
He admir'd above all a Cannon ſix Foot long,
which was not mounted; and, kiſſing the
ground, ſaid, He perceiv'd by thoſe Preſents
that the <hi>French</hi> were <hi>Men;</hi> for they call all
other Nations <hi>Gyon,</hi> that is, <hi>a Nation leſs than
Men.</hi> The Letter-Caſe was put into a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bira</hi>
or little Bag of Mo-hair, and order'd to
be ſafely preſerv'd. The reſt of the Day
was ſpent in Diſcourſes concerning the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Peace: and the <hi>Alcayd Aly,</hi> who
was appointed Commiſſioner for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
with <hi>Aly Manino</hi> and <hi>Mehemed Thummin</hi>
went to the Ambaſſador's Tent, and confer'd
with him till Two in the Morning: But they
were ſo far from coming to any Concluſion,
that they tore all that they had done, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Ambaſſador's Propoſals did not
tend to a Peace. On the <hi>12th.</hi> the <hi>Alcayd Aly</hi>
with his two Aſſociates return'd to the Tent,
and after they had ſpent two Hours in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Conference, took horſe to attend the
King, and know his Pleaſure. Three hours
after <hi>Aly Manino</hi> brought back word, that
his Majeſty was reſolv'd to grant all that the
Ambaſſadour ſhou'd deſire, and even more
if it was poſſible. The next day the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayd
Aly</hi> return'd with <hi>Aly Manino,</hi> and
concluded the Treaty with the Ambaſſador,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51877:113"/>
who, two hours after, went to receive his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Leave. He found the King on
Horſe-back, engag'd in his uſual Exerciſes,
which laſted till Night, after which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſent word to the Ambaſſador, that
'twas the Hour of Prayer, and that he wou'd
ſpeak with him at his coming out; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon
as he came forth he ſent the <hi>Alcayd Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi>
who had been Ambaſſador in <hi>England,</hi>
to acquaint him that he had granted all his
Propoſals. The Ambaſſador reply'd, that he
had nothing more to deſire of his Majeſty,
and that he eſteem'd himſelf too happy in
being an Eye-witneſs of ſo firm a Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
between two ſuch potent Emperours:
after which the <hi>Alcayd Lucas</hi> return'd with
that Anſwer to the King, who order'd him
to bring the Count of S. <hi>Amand</hi> before him.
He found his Majeſty ſtanding in the midſt
of his Camp, who receiv'd him in a very
kind and friendly Manner, and after the
Ambaſſador had thank'd him for the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Treatment he had receiv'd in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
that Monarch charg'd him to ſalute the
Emperour of <hi>France</hi> in his Name, and to give
him the Salutation of Peace, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd
a very eloquent Phraſe in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to expreſs a ſincere Affection, nor do
they ever uſe it in ſpeaking to <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
The King of <hi>Morocco</hi> is of a middle Stature,
neither too great, nor too ſmall; his Air is
courteous and inſpires Reſpect, his Gate lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and his Mouth ſomewhat little; he has
black Hair, ſparkling Eyes, and a Hawk-Noſe.
He had on his Head a red Cap
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51877:113"/>
wrapt about with a Muſlin <hi>Turbant,</hi> a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
of a ſort of very White Wooll,<note place="margin">Which is a kind of Cloth.</note>
with another about it of Yellow Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask.
The Habit he wore conſiſted of a
<hi>Cafetan</hi> of Nut-colour'd Cloth, a wide and
ſleeveleſs Coat of Gold and Silk, and under
that a <hi>Haique</hi> of white Muſlin girt round his
Body like a Cloth, with a Shirt of Mail to
ſecure him againſt private Attempts, a Piece
of Caution that may be excus'd in one that
has been three or four times in danger of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination;
a green Waſt-Coat, and then a
Shirt with Sleeves like thoſe of a Surplice.
His Boots, or rather Buskins, were of red
Leather plaited all over; and his Spurrs of
Iron gilt, with a Prick as long as a Bodkin.
He had about 200 Horſes who were not very
beautiful, but they were of a large Size, and
ſeem'd to be very good. His Army conſiſted
of between 40 and 50000 Men, encamp'd
(as they fight) without any Order, on Mount
<hi>Atlas.</hi> Sometimes he puts himſelf at the
Head of 10000 Horſe to enure 'em to War,
for they are only a ſort of undiſciplin'd <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi>
His uſual Guard was then compos'd of
7000 <hi>Negro's,</hi> and 300 <hi>Renegado's</hi> cloath'd in
Red and Green, beſides 200 Pages both
<hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Blacks,</hi> who are his Slaves. The
Ambaſſador in his Return was conducted
by <hi>Bengaraya</hi> Son to the King of <hi>Talmenin,</hi>
who provided much better Entertainment for
him on the Road, than <hi>Mehemed Thummin</hi>
did in his Journey to the Court, tho' he was
treated with all poſſible Civility in <hi>France.</hi> It
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51877:114"/>
happen'd by the way, that one of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's
Servants was ſlightly wounded by
a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> with a Fire-Lock charg'd with
Hail-ſhot: Immediately <hi>Bengaraya,</hi> without
ſpeaking a word, laid his Hand on his Horſe,
and drawing out his Scymitar, cut off the
Heads of three Men, without once enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
who diſcharg'd the Piece, and ask'd the
Ambaſſador whether he wou'd have him cut
off Fifty Heads more, who reply'd that he
was more than ſatisfi'd with what he had
done already: then, ſaid he, you muſt give
me an Acquittance under your Hand, for,
without that, if the King ſhou'd be inform'd
that I have only cut off three Heads, he
wou'd certainly take off mine. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
granted his Deſire, and learn'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Morocco,</hi> who commands
under the King's Brother, paſſing by the
Place where the Accident happen'd, had
caus'd 20 <hi>Barbarians</hi> to be beheaded, and
ſent 50 more to <hi>Morocco,</hi> where they were
kept Priſoners. In moſt Places the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
was receiv'd with extraordinary Reſpect,
and even the Women came forth to meet
him ſhouting for Joy, tho' that Honour is by
Cuſtom appropriated to the King. He arriv'd
at <hi>Tetuan</hi> on the <hi>19th.</hi> and the <hi>22th.</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
of <hi>Salley, Aly Manino, Benachey,</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
<hi>Ben Joſeph,</hi> and the <hi>Alcayd Lucas,</hi> Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Seals, gave him the Letters direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his Majeſty, which were ſeal'd on the
Out-ſide. And after he had receiv'd Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the Veſſel taken by the <hi>Salley</hi>-Bark,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51877:114"/>
he went on board the <hi>Valiant,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1683"/> and
arriv'd at <hi>Toulon</hi> on the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1683,
with twenty <hi>French</hi> Slaves, whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>Morocco</hi> ſent for a Preſent to his
Majeſty.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time that <hi>Colbert</hi> neglected
no Opportunities of diſplaying his Maſter's
Grandeur in foreign Countries, he apply'd
himſelf with his uſual Diligence to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
of Affairs at Home: He injoyn'd
a rigorous Execution of the Orders that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thoſe who are not arriv'd at the
Age appointed by Law, or have Relations
in the prohibited Degrees already in Office,
from being admitted into the Superiour
Courts: But when he perceiv'd how much
the Offices of Judicature were diſregarded
ſince their Prices were fixt, he thought fit,
in ſome meaſure, to mitigate that Severity;
and to facilitate the filling up of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he perſuaded the King to grant Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
till the end of the Year 1686, at
the rate of 1500 Livres for each prohibited
Relation, and as much for the defect of
Age. The ſame Miniſter being inform'd
that the Money rais'd by the Duties grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Cities and Corporations for the
payment of their Debts, was diverted to
other uſes, procur'd an Order of Council
bearing Date the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1683, by
which the Mayors, Echevins, Conſuls, and
other Officers who had receiv'd thoſe Summs,
were oblig'd to give an Account of 'em in
three Months, before the Intendants of their
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51877:115"/>
reſpective Generalities. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1682"/> 
               <hi>Colbert</hi> obtain'd alſo
the Publication of another Edict, to reſtrain
thoſe that were poſſeſs'd of Offices in Courts
of Judicature, from making uſe of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to defraud their Creditors: And the
better to regulate the Diſtribution of the
Valuation, 'twas ordain'd by the ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
that Opponents to the Seal ſhall be
preferr'd before all other Creditors, tho'
they be priviledg'd Perſons, who have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
that Circumſtance, and even before
thoſe who have obtain'd an actual Seizure of
the Benefits of the Offices; and that of
thoſe Opponents ſuch as are priviledg'd ſhall
be firſt paid; that afterwards the Mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees
ſhall be rank'd according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of their reſpective Mortgages, and that
the Overplus of the Valuation ſhall be ſhar'd
among the Creditors that have only Bills or
Notes for their Aſſurance. The ſame Edict
ordains, that ſix Months after the ſeizure
of the Benefits of Offices in Superiour
Courts, and three Months in the Subaltern
Courts, the Creditors may obtain an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
obliging the Titulary Poſſeſſor to
conſtitute an Attorney <hi>ad reſignandum,</hi> in
default of which, the Judgment awarded
ſhall have the force of a Warrant of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney;
and that three Years after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of a Judgment, if it be confirm'd
by a Sentence, or if there be no Appeal
made from it, the Officer ſhall remain abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
prohibited and incapacitated to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his Office.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:51877:115"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1683"/> 
               <hi>Colbert</hi> being inform'd that the Pyrates of
<hi>Algiers</hi> continu'd ſtill to diſturb his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Subjects in the proſecution of their
Trade, reſolv'd either to deſtroy 'em irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably,
or to force 'em to beg a Peace:
And in order to the accompliſhment of
that Deſign, he ſent his Son, the Marqueſs
<hi>de Seignelay,</hi> to <hi>Provence,</hi> to haſten the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Fleet. Immediately after his
Arrival at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> he took a review of
the Galleys, which he found in very good
order, eſpecially the ſixteen that were fitted
out by his Majeſty's Orders. He viſited al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the Harbour, Magazins, and Hoſpital,
and then went to <hi>Toulon,</hi> to diſpatch the
Marqueſs <hi>du Quêne</hi> on the deſign'd Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with the Galleys and other Veſſels of
his Majeſty's Navy. After the departure of
the Fleet, the <hi>Chevalier de Lery,</hi> by the way,
took a Pyrate of <hi>Algiers,</hi> of eighteen Guns,
and one hundred and fifty Men, in which
he found thirty <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves, whom he ſet
at liberty. And the Marqueſs <hi>d' Amfreville</hi>
ſunk a Bark belonging to the ſame Pyrates,
and retook a Veſſel laden with Marble,
which they were ſending to <hi>Algiers.</hi> The
News of this Expedition drove all the Pyrates
into their Harbour, except two Caravells,
two Barks, and another Veſſel, that were ſail'd
to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>du Quêne</hi> ſet
ſail from <hi>Toulon, May 6th.</hi> 1683, with ſix
Men of War, having order'd the Galleys,
Bomb-Veſſels, Pinnaces, and other Veſſels,
to meet at the Iſlands call'd <hi>Fromentieres,</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:51877:116"/>
near <hi>Yvica.</hi> Some Days after he met with
a Storm, and was forc'd to ſpend ſome
time in refitting his Ships; after which he
ſet ſail on the <hi>18th.</hi> and arriv'd on the <hi>4th.</hi>
of <hi>June</hi> at the appointed Rendezvous, after
he had ſcowr'd the Coaſt of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> He
was joyn'd on the <hi>9th.</hi> by the Bomb-Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
and Pinnaces, and proceeded on his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Voyage without the Galleys, who
were not yet come up. On the <hi>18th.</hi> he
diſcover'd the Road of <hi>Algiers,</hi> where he
found the Marqueſs <hi>d' Amfreville,</hi> who had
lately retaken an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship from a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
that pretended to belong to <hi>Tetuan,</hi>
but had a Commiſſion from <hi>Algiers:</hi> And
in the ſame place he was joyn'd by <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teme,
Vilette, du Merré,</hi> and S. <hi>Mars-Colbert.</hi>
He order'd his Ships to Anchor as near the
Port as they cou'd, but without Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot,
and poſted nine of 'em at equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
in a crooked Line, reſembling the
Figure of the Mole. Theſe were the <hi>Fleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
Firm, Syren, Prudent, Amiable, Vigilant,
Laurel, Sea-horſe,</hi> and <hi>Star,</hi> commanded by
the Count <hi>d' Etrées,</hi> the <hi>Chevalier de Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
the Count <hi>de Sepville,</hi> the <hi>Chevalier de
Lery, Septeme,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>d' Amfreville,</hi> the
Marqueſs <hi>du Quêne</hi> the Son, <hi>Bellile,</hi> and the
Commander <hi>des Goutes.</hi> The ſeven firſt were
order'd to carry each an Anchor, with mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-ſiz'd
Cables, having one end faſten'd to
the Ship, within 600 <hi>Toiſes</hi> of the Mole, to
ſerve for the Towing of the Galleys to
their reſpective Poſts; and the <hi>Sea-horſe</hi> and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51877:116"/>
               <hi>Star</hi> had orders to carry their Anchors for
Towing nearer the Town than the other
ſeven, that advancing by the help of their
Anchors, they might lie on the Wings and
Flank, and ſupport the Bomb-Veſſels, if they
ſhou'd be attack'd by the Enemy; for the
Marqueſs <hi>du Quêne</hi> had receiv'd Advice,
that the <hi>Algerines</hi> had prepar'd two arm'd
Galleys, and other light Veſſels for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
and beſides, he order'd the Anchors
to be caſt nearer to each other than the
diſtances between the Men of War, that their
Front being contracted, they might be more
eaſily ſupported by the Men of War poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Wings, and that the Veſſels might
not be endanger'd by the changes of Wind
and Tide. The Bomb-Veſſels were the <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant,
Thunderer, Brulante, Bombard, Cruel,
Menaçante,</hi> and <hi>Ardent,</hi> commanded by <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigny,
Piaudiere, la Motte d' Eran, de Combes,
de Poenti, Goeſtin,</hi> and <hi>du Quêne-Monier.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the uſual Complement of the Galleys,
the Marqueſs order'd ten Soldiers of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
Guard, ten Granadiers, and as many
choſen Soldiers to embark on each of 'em;
and appointed two Pinnaces or arm'd Boats
to attend each Bomb-Veſſel, and two <hi>Corps
de Guard</hi> of thoſe Boats to ſupport the reſt.
The <hi>21ſt.</hi> and <hi>22d.</hi> were ſpent in taking up
the Poſts, and other neceſſary Preparations.
The <hi>23d.</hi> the Captains of the Ships carry'd
in their Towing-Anchors; the <hi>Chevalier de
Tourville</hi> carry'd the Anchor of the Veſſel
that was to be poſted next the North, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51877:117"/>
the Marqueſs <hi>d' Amfreville</hi> the Anchor of that
which was to be poſted towards the South.
The <hi>Chevalier de Lery</hi> carry'd the middle
Anchor; and thoſe of the Intervals were
carry'd by the Commanders of the Ships
to which the Cables were faſten'd. All
theſe Orders were executed without the leaſt
Oppoſition from the Enemy, who imagin'd
that the <hi>French</hi> made theſe Motions only to
obſerve the Mole, and try the reach of
their Guns; for the Work was carry'd on
with ſo much exactneſs, that the Enemy
ſaw neither the Anchors nor Cables. The
reſt of the Day was ſpent in preparing the
Bombs and Mortars; and in the Evening
<hi>Raymondis,</hi> Major of the Fleet, receiv'd Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to appoint a Guard of Pinnaces to
prevent the Enemies from weighing the
Anchors during the Night; but they kept
cloſe in the Port. The <hi>24th.</hi> no Attempt
cou'd be made, by reaſon of the bad Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which continu'd alſo on the <hi>25th,</hi> but
at Night was ſucceeded by a perfect Calm;
and therefore the Marqueſs <hi>du Quêne</hi> gave
the Signal for the Bomb-Veſſels to advance
in order; the Men of War took up their
Poſts on the Wings, and the Major ſent
part of the arm'd Boats towards the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
on the North, and the reſt towards
thoſe on the South. Each Bomb-Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
was accompany'd with two Boats, and
two others were plac'd near the Entry of
the Port, with two light Boats furniſh'd
with Matches and Trains, which they were
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51877:117"/>
order'd to fire if the Enemy ſhou'd venture
out of the Port, for a Signal to all the
arm'd Boats on the Wings to advance to
the relief of the Galleys. The Bomb-Veſſels
did not begin to play till one a-clock in
the Morning, becauſe the roughneſs of the
Sea hinderd their Approach: They conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
firing two Hours, and threw ninety
Bombs, which fell (at leaſt almoſt all of 'em)
either in the Port, on the Mole, or in the
City. In the mean time the <hi>Chevaliers de
Tourville,</hi> and <hi>de Lery,</hi> with the principal
Officers, went about in their Boats to give
neceſſary Orders, with an extraordinary
Bravery and Diligence. Aſſoon as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
ſaw the Mortars planted, they play'd
furiouſly with their Great Guns, and fir'd
above 600 Shot. They had kindl'd great
Fires on the Mole, to diſcover the Bomb-Veſſels
and Boats; and always when they
perceiv'd the Fire of the Mortars, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
diſcharg'd all their Guns, but
without doing any Execution. The Bombs
made a prodigious havock, as the Slaves
afterwards related: Several arm'd Barks that
were in the Port were ſunk in an inſtant.
Some of the Bombs falling on the Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
diſmounted ſeveral Pieces of Cannon;
and thoſe which fell into the City kill'd
a great number of Perſons. Several Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
were thrown down, and many of the
Inhabitants buried under the Ruins. After
the Bomb-Veſſels had continu'd firing for
two Hours with ſo great Succeſs, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51877:118"/>
               <hi>du Quêne</hi> thought fit to give the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of Retreat by firing two Guns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there aroſe a Land-Wind which wou'd
have endanger'd the Bomb-Veſſels. The
<hi>27th.</hi> in the Evening, perceiving the Sea to
be calm, he commanded the Bomb-Veſſels
to advance in the ſame Order as before;
and they threw in about 120 Bombs with
extraordinary Succeſs, while the Enemy
made a continual fire with their Cannon.
The <hi>French</hi> loſt only <hi>Choiſeul d' Ambouville,</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of the <hi>Prudent,</hi> who was kill'd, with
two Soldiers in a Boat, by the ſame Shot.
Some of the Enemy's Bullets reach'd the
Bomb-Veſſels, and the <hi>Ardent,</hi> commanded
by <hi>du Quêne Monier,</hi> which lay next the
Mole, receiv'd ſeveral Shot without any
damage, by reaſon of the ſinglar Artifice
with which ſhe, as well as the reſt, were
contriv'd. At laſt there aroſe ſo furious a
Land-Wind, and the Sea grew ſo rough,
that the Bomb-Veſſels were forc'd to retire
to the Ships that ſupported 'em, becauſe all
the Towing-Anchors were ſet a-drift by the
Storm. The Bombs that were thrown this
Night did greater execution than before:
For one of 'em falling upon the Watch-Tower,
and rolling downwards, diſorder'd
the Batteries, and kill'd ſeveral Officers of
the Artillery; and moſt of the reſt fell ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the City, or upon the Mole,
which were very much ſhatter'd by 'em.
Aſſoon as the Galleys retir'd, there aroſe a
Mutiny in the Town, and a great number
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51877:118"/>
of Women, not able to ſupport the cruelty
of their Diſaſters, went in a deſperate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to the <hi>Baſſa, Dey,</hi> and principal Officers,
ſome carrying their mangl'd Children, and
others the Arms and Heads of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
and Relations that were kill'd by the
Bombs. The Soldiery were alſo acceſſory
to the Mutiny, and accus'd <hi>Baba-Haſſan</hi> in
a threatning manner, as the Author of the
Breach with <hi>France,</hi> and conſequently of
the Miſery of <hi>Algiers:</hi> Their Commanders
proteſted they were and wou'd always be
ready to march againſt their Enemies, but
added, that they wou'd not be thus kill'd
in their Houſes; and went boldly to the
<hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Houſe, requiring him to inflict a due
Puniſhment on <hi>Baba-Haſſan,</hi> and make a
Peace with <hi>France.</hi> In compliance with
their Deſires, the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> whoſe Office does
not entitle him to an abſolute Authority
in the City, call'd a meeting of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi>
on the <hi>20th.</hi> early in the Morning, and
after he had prepar'd their Minds with a
pathetic Declamation againſt <hi>Baba-Haſſan,</hi>
he endeavour'd to convince 'em of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſity
of deſiring a Peace from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, adding, that if
they refus'd to take that Courſe, which was
the only way to ſave the City from utter
Deſtruction, he was reſolv'd to retire to <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
and write to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba-Haſſan</hi>
had ruin'd <hi>Algiers,</hi> and made it
incapable of paying the uſual Tribute to his
Highneſs. The Principal Members of the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51877:119"/>
               <hi>Divan</hi> and Military Officers were ſo mov'd
by theſe Remonſtrances, that they agreed
unanimouſly to follow his Advice: And in
purſuance of that Reſolution, they deputed
a particular Friend of <hi>Baba-Haſſan,</hi> whom
they ſent, with an Interpreter, in a Pinnace
with a white Flag, and oblig'd the Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>le Vacher,</hi> to accompany him. They
arriv'd about nine in the Morning, at the
Admiral's Veſſel, who without ſuffering 'em
to come on board, order'd 'em to retire
behind the Ship, where they might deliver
their Propoſals, and receive an Anſwer
from the Deck: But being inform'd by
<hi>le Vacher,</hi> of the Secret of the Meſſage, he
permitted the Deputy and his Interpreter to
come on board, and anſwer'd 'em in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
to prevent both Miſtakes and Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations;
that he wou'd not hearken
to any Propoſals of Peace, till they had free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcharg'd and ſet at liberty all their
<hi>French</hi> Slaves, and even thoſe of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whom they had taken on board <hi>French</hi>
Ships. At laſt, after ſeveral Comings and
Goings, 141 Slaves were brought on
board the Admiral, among whom was
<hi>Beaujeu,</hi> a Captain of one of his Majeſty's
Ships, who was taken in a ſmall Veſſel,
and ſold for 11200 <hi>Piaſters;</hi> and the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
who accompany'd 'em, aſſur'd the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
that there was Orders given to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together all the <hi>French</hi> Slaves, and thoſe
that were taken under the Banner of <hi>France,</hi>
and to reſtore 'em without delay. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51877:119"/>
alſo (in <hi>Baba-Haſſan</hi>'s Name) the
liberty of the <hi>Reys,</hi> and other <hi>Algerines</hi> that
were taken by <hi>de Lery</hi> in his way to <hi>Algiers,</hi>
but cou'd not obtain a favourable Anſwer.
On the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> and <hi>1ſt.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> he
brought 276 Slaves more; and after ſeveral
earneſt Solicitations, obtain'd the liberty of
the <hi>Reys.</hi> The remaining Slaves were alſo
freed, and brought on board before the <hi>5th.</hi>
and among the reſt, four Women, one of
<hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and three of <hi>Meſſina.</hi> Thus his
Majeſty humbl'd the Inſolence of thoſe
haughty Pyrates, who imagin'd themſelves
to be ſecur'd from the danger of being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd
in their Port, after the unſucceſsful
Attempt of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V.</p>
            <p>The Joy with which <hi>Colbert</hi> receiv'd the
News of the happy Succeſs of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Arms at Sea, and his deſire to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip
the Marqueſs of <hi>Louvois,</hi> who for a
long time had been the Object of his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,
made him ſtrive with ſo much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs
to diſcharge the Duties of ſo many
ſeveral Offices, that at laſt he ſunk under
that perpetual and inſupportable Load of
Cares, and the fatal violence of his laſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
occaſion'd by a Stone in the Kidneys,
which put an end to his Life on the <hi>6th.</hi>
of <hi>September</hi> 1683, at the Age of Sixty four
Years. He was aſſiſted at his Death by
<hi>Cornoüaille,</hi> Vicar of St. <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> and that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
Preacher, Father <hi>Bourdaloüe,</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit:
And the Ceremony of his Interrment
was perform'd in the Night, under a Guard
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51877:120"/>
of the Soldiers of the Watch, to prevent the
Fury of his implacable Enemies, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Children erected a ſtately Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Memory, in the Church of
St. <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> where his Buſt of White Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is to be ſeen, of very curious Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip.
His Death was made the Subject
of many Verſes, of which thoſe that
follow are agreeable to the Account of his
Birth, in the beginning of this Hiſtory:</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Colbert</hi>'s dead—I'm ſure he's dead;</l>
               <l>I ſaw his breathleſs Body laid</l>
               <l>On a Bed of mournful State,</l>
               <l>With all the ſolemn Pomp of Fate.</l>
               <l>I ſoftly walk'd, and often ſtood,</l>
               <l>And long the pleaſing Object view'd.</l>
               <l>Each Room Death's Sable Liv'ry wore,</l>
               <l>And all the Marks of Sorrow bore;</l>
               <l>Splendid Sorrow reign'd o'er all;</l>
               <l>Sorrow cover'd every Wall.</l>
               <l>At laſt I ſpy'd a Fellow grinning,</l>
               <l>And heard him whiſper out his meaning:</l>
               <l>Pray, Sir, what makes you look ſo ſullen?</l>
               <l>D'ye grudge the waſte of ſo much <hi>Woollen?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Cou'd leſs be done, good Mr. Gaper,</l>
               <l>In honour of old <hi>Dad</hi> the Draper?</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Manuſcripts and moſt curious Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that numerous Collection of Books
which he left, were taken out of Cardinal
<hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Library, who entruſted him with
the Adminiſtration of that part of his Goods:
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51877:120"/>
for he ſent only the moſt common Pieces
to the College of the <hi>Four Nations,</hi> contrary
to the Will of his Benefactor, who left his
Library for the Uſe and Inſtruction of the
Students of that College.</p>
            <p>His Offices were divided after his Death:
That of <hi>Comptroller-General of the Finances</hi> was
given to <hi>Claude le Pelletier,</hi> Counſellour of
State, who had formerly been Counſellour
in the Parliament, Preſident of the Court
of Inqueſts, Provoſt of the Merchants, and
was afterwards made Counſellour of State
in Ordinary: He had alſo been Tutor to
the Children of <hi>John-Baptiſt Gaſton,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Orleans,</hi> and acquir'd a great deal of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
by his wiſe Management of that
Truſt. He was an exact and judicious
Perſon, and a good Judge; but his unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs
with the Affairs of the <hi>Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
made him ſo ſlow in diſpatching 'em,
that no leſs skilful a Succeſſor than <hi>Pont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartrain,</hi>
cou'd have prevented the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of his Remiſſneſs. The Office of
<hi>Superintendant of the Buildings</hi> was beſtow'd
on <hi>Michael-Francis le Tellier,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois,</hi>
Miniſter and Secretary of State, with
the <hi>Protectorſhip of the Academy of Painting;</hi>
tho' <hi>Julius-Armand Colbert,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Blain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
Son of the Deceas'd, had obtain'd the
Reverſion of the Office of <hi>Superintendant.</hi>
So that of all his Places, only the Offices
of <hi>Secretary of State,</hi> and of <hi>Commander and
Great Treaſurer of his Majeſty's Orders</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in the Family, which were given
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:51877:121"/>
to the Marqueſs of <hi>Seignelay,</hi> whoſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
was perfectly oppoſite to that of his
Father. For the Son's Magnificence was as
remarkable as his Father's Frugality: His
Table was ſumptuous, and his Furniture
ſplendid and rich: He had a Cloſet ſet
round with Looking-Glaſſes, and another
Wainſcotted with <hi>Calamba</hi>-Wood, which
was brought by his Orders from <hi>Siam:</hi> He
bought of <hi>Alvarez</hi> a Collection of <hi>Italian</hi>
Pictures and Statues, to the value of 300000
Livres, part of which he paid in Paſs-ports,
and in the Ships that he lent him. He
was Maſter of a great deal of Learning and
Politeneſs; but never any Man exceeded
him in Vanity; and he was an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
lover of Pleaſures. He was twice Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd,
firſt with <hi>Mary Margaret,</hi> Marchioneſs
of <hi>Alegre,</hi> whoſe Fortune amounted to above
60000 Livres, Yearly Revenue, and after
her Death with <hi>Katharin Tereſa de Matignen,</hi>
Daughter of the Count <hi>de Thorigny,</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Lieutenant-General in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and
of <hi>Frances de le Luthumiere.</hi> The Marchioneſs
of <hi>Alegre</hi> cou'd not eaſily be perſuaded to
Marry a Husband of ſo mean birth, but
<hi>Colbert</hi> had gain'd the Marqueſſes <hi>d' Alegre</hi>
and <hi>d' Urfé,</hi> the Uncles and Guardians of
that rich Heireſs. In conſideration of this
Match, the Biſhoprick of <hi>Limoges</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
on the Count <hi>de Sommerive,</hi> the
Son of the latter; and the Father obtain'd
recommendatory Letters to the principal
Officers in the Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:51877:121"/>
where he had an important Suit depending,
againſt his Nephew the Count <hi>de Mailly,</hi>
about the Inheritance of the Dutcheſs of
<hi>Crouy.</hi> The Marchioneſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of her Husband occaſion'd frequent
Quarrels between 'em; and the Marqueſs,
who was naturally of a haughty Temper, was
once ſo tranſported with Fury, that he gave her
a Blow, which coſt him a Drubbing that
his Father beſtow'd on him, for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of his Manners: But the Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoe
produc'd no other effect on him,
than the <hi>Indian</hi> Root, with which <hi>Boccace</hi>'s
<hi>Joſeph</hi> attempted to cure his Wife of her
Sawcineſs. After that Lady's Death, the
Duke of <hi>Bournonville</hi> offer'd his Daughter,
who was alſo very rich, to ſupply her place;
but <hi>Colbert</hi> refus'd the Match, knowing that
the Duke (who was <hi>Fouquet</hi>'s intimate
Friend) hop'd by that means to be rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated
in the Government of <hi>Paris,</hi> which
he injoy'd during Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s
Life.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Blainville</hi> having loſt all
hope of his Superintendantſhip, reſolv'd to
depend on his Sword for the Advancement of
his Fortune, and contented himſelf at preſent
with the mean Preferment of a Lieutenant's
Place in the Regiment of <hi>Picardy. Anthony Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Colbert,</hi> tho' ſcarce a Gentleman, was (as
I hinted before) receiv'd Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi>
during the Life of his Father; and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
to flatter both, ſaid aloud at his
coming out, that the young Pretender had
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51877:122"/>
paſs'd his Four Quarters. <hi>Moreri</hi> derives
<hi>Colbert</hi>'s Pedigree from an ancient <hi>Scotch</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
that ſettl'd in <hi>Champaign</hi> in the XIII.
Age, according to that Author's Opinion,
which he grounds on the Epitaph of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Colbert,</hi> at the Church of the <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi>
at <hi>Rheims,</hi> accompany'd with the Arms
of that Family: But that Proof is of no
force, for the alledg'd Inſcription was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
there, when <hi>Colbert</hi> deſign'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Honour of the <hi>Malteſe</hi> Knighthood
for his Son, as appears by the Teſtimony
of the old Inhabitants of that City, who
affirm that formerly there was no Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
on the Tomb. <hi>Giles Menage,</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
Wit, and one of <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Penſioners,
attempted to ſqueeze ſome new Favours
out of him by compoſing his Genealogy,
which he deduc'd from the ancient Kings
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but that Miniſter perceiving
the obvious groſſneſs of the Flattery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of rewarding his Zeal, depriv'd him
of his Penſion. A memorable Example for
thoſe deſigning Panegyriſts, who over-act
their Parts, and injure their Patrons by
ſtrain'd and fulſom <hi>Encomiums.</hi> The <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
Colbert</hi> was ſo fortunate in his new
Dignity, that he was made Grand <hi>Croix de
Grace,</hi> and General of the Galleys of the
Order: But that Preferment ſerv'd only to
haſten his Diſgrace, by diſcovering his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs
for the ſuitable Diſcharge of ſo great
a Truſt: For with ſeven Galleys that
were under his command, he had not the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:51877:122"/>
Courage to attack three <hi>Tripolin</hi> Veſſels
which he found becalm'd; and his Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
wou'd have infallibly ruin'd him, if
he had not been protected by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Brother, the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay.</hi>
After that Diſaſter he left the Sea-Service,
and endeavouring to recover his Honour,
loſt his Life at the Head of the Regiment of
<hi>Champaign,</hi> of which he was Colonel. <hi>James
Nicholas Colbert,</hi> at preſent Archbiſhop of
<hi>Rohan,</hi> tho' he had renounc'd the Fair Sex,
by entring into the Epiſcopal Order, cou'd
not forbear eſpouſing the Quarrel of his
old Miſtreſs, <hi>la Certain,</hi> and even carry'd his
Complaiſance ſo high, as to puniſh the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
of her new Lover, <hi>Lully,</hi> who
had forſaken her for the young <hi>Brunet,</hi> by
making the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> give him
a ſevere Reprimand, and cauſing him to be
ſhut up in St. <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>The difference that happen'd ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
between the King and the Republick
of <hi>Genoa,</hi> gave the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> an
opportunity of diſcovering the Extent and
Variety of his Abilities. His Majeſty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
that the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> entertain'd a cloſer
Correſpondence with the Count <hi>de Melgar,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> than was conſiſtent
with the Neutrality they promis'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
between the two Crowns; that they
were fitting out four new Galleys to join
thoſe they uſually kept in his Catholick
Majeſty's Service, under the Command of
the Duke of <hi>Turſis;</hi> that they ſent Powder
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51877:123"/>
and Bombs to the <hi>Algarins,</hi> for the burning
of his Majeſty's Galleys in the Port of
<hi>Marſeilles;</hi> That they refus'd to grant a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
for the Tranſportation of the Salt, that
by Virtue of an agreement with the Duke
of <hi>Mantua,</hi> was to be carry'd thither from
<hi>France,</hi> and wou'd not ſuffer him to ſettle
Magazins at <hi>Savona;</hi> and that they wou'd
not do Juſtice to the Count <hi>de Fieſque,</hi> by
reſtoring to him the Inheritance of the
Count <hi>de Lavagne</hi>'s Eſtate. The Marqueſs
<hi>de St. Olon,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Reſident at <hi>Genoa,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
all thoſe Injuries to the Senate,
demanding Satisfaction in his Maſter's Name,
and at laſt declar'd, That if they perſiſted in
their Reſolution to launch four new Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
his Majeſty wou'd interpret that as
an Act of Hoſtility, and command his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to ſeize not only on theſe Veſſels,
but on all that belong'd to the Republick.
But all his Remonſtrances and Threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were ſlighted by the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> who
wou'd not be perſuaded to give his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
any Satisfaction; and therefore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
took his Audience of Leave, and the
Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> was order'd to make
neceſſary preparations for a Naval Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1684"/>
and even for the Landing of ſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
if the Obſtinacy of the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> ſhou'd
conſtrain his Majeſty to uſe 'em with the
utmoſt Rigour.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as the Marqueſs receiv'd theſe
Orders, he wrote to <hi>Bonrepos,</hi> Intendant of
the Marine, to put 'em in execution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:51877:123"/>
acquainting him with the Deſign; and
not long after ſet forward for <hi>Toulon,</hi> where
he arriv'd on the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1684, and
took a Review of the Ships and Galleys.
On the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> he embark'd for the Iſles
of <hi>Hieres,</hi> where the General Rendezvous
of the Fleet was appointed; and ſet ſail
on the <hi>12th.</hi> with fourteen Men of War,

<hi>Chevalier de la Fare,</hi> the Count <hi>du Luc, Bourſe
Ville,</hi> and the <hi>Chevalier de Tancour.</hi> The
Fleet arriv'd before <hi>Genoa</hi> on the <hi>17th.</hi> of
<hi>May,</hi> and the ten Bomb-Veſſels which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
two Mortars each, were drawn up in
a Line at the diſtance of Cannon-Shot from
the Walls, ſtretching from the Watch-Tower
on the Left, to the <hi>Fauxbourg de Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagno</hi>
on the Right. The Men of War
made another Line behind the Bomb-Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
at the diſtance of 200 <hi>Toiſes,</hi> with the
Galleys divided into two Squadrons. The
Day after their Arrival, the Senate deputed
ſix of their Body to offer Propoſals, by
way of Excuſe, to the Marqueſs <hi>de Seigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,</hi>
which he rejected, becauſe there was no
mention made of giving Satisfaction to his
Majeſty. And they were even ſo little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to an Accommodation, that after the
Deputies were return'd, they began to fire
at the <hi>French</hi> Fleet; which was a ſufficient
Provocation to oblige the Marqueſs <hi>de Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelay,</hi>
to begin the Bombardment, with the
Succeſs of ruining ſeveral Palaces, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Buildings in the <hi>Prado.</hi> The <hi>20th.</hi>
ſome of the Bomb-Veſſels were order'd to
ſtand in nearer the Harbour, to play upon
thoſe parts of the City that had not yet
receiv'd any Damage; and one of the
Bombs that were thrown in after that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51877:124"/>
fell upon a Palace at a great diſtance,
whither ſeveral Ladies of Quality had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd;
nor was the Havock they made in
the Port leſs conſiderable, where ſeveral
Barks were ſhatter'd to pieces. The <hi>French</hi>
Bombs wou'd have quickly frighted the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeſe</hi>
into a Complyance with his Majeſty's
Deſires, if they had not been animated by
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> whom they had receiv'd into
the City. And therefore the Marqueſs <hi>de
Seignelay</hi> ſeeing that they perſiſted in their
Obſtinacy, reſolv'd to make a Deſcent, in
order to deſtroy the fine Palaces in the
<hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of <hi>S. Pietro d' Arena.</hi> To execute
this Deſign, 1500 Men were detach'd from
the Men of War, and 2000 from the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
under the Command of the Duke <hi>de
Mortemar,</hi> and the <hi>Chevalier de Tourville:</hi>
And at the ſame time a falſe Attack was
made with 700 Men, towards <hi>Biſagno,</hi> by
the Marqueſs <hi>d' Amfreville,</hi> who executed his
Commiſſion with a great deal of Vigour,
tho' in the beginning of the Engagement
he receiv'd a Wound in the Thigh, which
was very troubleſome to him for a long
time after. They who were appointed to
carry on the true Attack, in the firſt place
made themſelves Maſters of a Fort that
might have cut off their Retreat, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
drove the Enemy from Houſe to
Houſe, poſſeſſing themſelves of the ſame
Poſts which they abandon'd. And after
they had almoſt wholly ruin'd that <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
they retir'd on board the Ships, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:51877:125"/>
loſt the <hi>Chevalier de Lery,</hi> and four or
five inferiour Officers. The <hi>29th.</hi> of the
ſame Month, the Fleet ſet ſail, and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at <hi>Toulon</hi> on the firſt of <hi>June.</hi> The
Pope offer'd his Mediation for a Treaty
of Peace, which was concluded on the

by his Majeſty. For to obtain an
entire Ceſſation of all Hoſtilities, the <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſe</hi>
ſubmitted to, (and afterwards punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perform'd) theſe Conditions; That the
<hi>Doge,</hi> accompany'd with four Senators,
ſhou'd come in Perſon to give Satisfaction
to his Majeſty, and at their return, re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Poſſeſſion and Exerciſes of
their Offices; That the Republick ſhou'd
diſmiſs all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, reduce the
Galleys to their ancient Number, reſtore or
make good all that they had taken from the
<hi>French,</hi> and pay 100000 Crowns to the
Count <hi>de Fieſque.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de Seigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay</hi>
was ſo pleas'd with the happy Succeſs
of this Expedition, that 'twas almoſt the
only Subject of his Diſcourſe; and he caus'd
his Picture to be drawn, as he ſtood in the
<hi>Reale</hi>-Galley, with a General's Batoon in his
Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1684"/> The firſt Office of State that he perform'd
after his Return, was the giving Audience
to the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Siam.</hi> For that
Prince being inform'd that his firſt Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
to <hi>France</hi> were unfortunately loſt at
Sea, made choice of two Officers of his
Houſhold to undertake that Voyage in the

and Commerce between his Subjects and
the <hi>French Eaſt-India</hi> Company. And the
Confidence he repos'd in the Apoſtolical
Miſſionaries that were in his Dominions,
made him deſire the Biſhop of <hi>Metellopolis</hi>
to appoint one of theſe Fathers to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
his Ambaſſadors in their Voyage to
<hi>Siam.</hi> In complyance with ſo juſt a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
that Prelate made choice of <hi>Vachet,</hi> an
old Miſſionary of <hi>Cochin-China,</hi> who, with
the two Ambaſſadors, <hi>Okoane Pichey Vallite,</hi>
and <hi>Khonne Pichiſe</hi> or <hi>Aiti,</hi> ſix other <hi>Siameſe,</hi>
and an Interpreter of the ſame Nation, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
on an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel <hi>January</hi> 13. 1684.
which brought 'em to <hi>England,</hi> from whence
they paſs'd to <hi>Calice,</hi> where they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi>'s Order,
and conducted to <hi>Paris</hi> at the King's Charge.
Afterwards the Marqueſs ſent two Coaches
to bring 'em to the Audience he had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
'em, and receiv'd 'em in his Cloſet.
The Ambaſſadors at their Entry bowed
thrice with their Faces to the Ground, and
their Hands joyn'd and lifted up to the
Crown of their Head, after the Faſhion of
their Country: Then they ſate down on a
piece of Tapeſtry, and having repeated the
principal Articles of their Commiſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
ſome of the Articles with him;
after which they had Audience of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs

The Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay,</hi> who ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Father in the Management of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
relating to Trade, procur'd an Order
of Council, bearing date <hi>January</hi> 6, 1685,
by which his Majeſty not only confirms
the Licence granted to the <hi>Senega</hi>-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to Trade on the Coaſt of <hi>Afric,</hi> from
<hi>Cape-Blanc</hi> to the River of <hi>Sierra-Leona;</hi> but
expreſly prohibits all other Perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to drive any Trade or Traffick in
thoſe Parts, under the pain of forfeiting their
Ships and Commodities, and paying a Fine
of 3000 Livres: Revoking, nevertheleſs, the
Privilege granted to the ſame Company, to
engroſs the whole Trade of the Coaſt of
<hi>Guinea,</hi> to the <hi>Cape of Good Hope;</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
free leave and permiſſion to all his
Majeſty's Subjects to Trade on any part of
the Coaſt between the Cape and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<hi>Julius-Henry,</hi> then Duke <hi>d' Enguien,</hi> and
now Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> Great Maſter of the
King's Houſhold.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time the King call'd a
Meeting of the Clergy at St. <hi>Germain en
Laye,</hi> to conclude on the moſt proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
for the utter extirpation of <hi>Calviniſm</hi>
out of his Dominions. His Majeſty ſent
<hi>Lewis Boucherat,</hi> at preſent Chancellor of

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:51877:126"/>
to the Prelates and other Members of
that Aſſembly; and on the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> the
Clergy ſent Deputies to acquaint his Majeſty
with their Reſolutions, who were conducted
to their Audience, by the Marqueſs. In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of that Advice, the King ſet forth
an Edict, revoking and abrogating the Edict
of <hi>Nantes</hi> in 1698, that of <hi>Nimes</hi> in 1629,
and all other Edicts and Declarations granted
in favour of thoſe of the Reformed Religion.
The principal Traders of the City of <hi>Paris,</hi>
profeſſing that Religion, met according to
the Edict, in the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi>'s

and of <hi>Nicholas de la Reynie,</hi> Lieutenant of the
Polity, promiſed to embrace the <hi>Catholick

            <p>The King reſolving to ſup at the Marqueſs
<hi>de Seignelay</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Sceaux</hi> on the <hi>16th.</hi> of
<hi>July,</hi> 1685. the Marqueſs prepar'd to Regale
him with his uſual Magnificence. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
arriving about half an hour after Six,
was receiv'd at his Coming out of his Coach
by the Marqueſs, who conducted him to the
Garden, where he with the Dauphineſs, and
the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans,</hi> took their Seats in
a large Chair with four Places, and as
many Umbrella's, carry'd by Men; and
the reſt of the Ladies of the Court took
the Conveniency of other Chairs which they
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51877:127"/>
found there, the Princes and Lords attending
his Majeſty on Foot. Firſt they enter'd into
the <hi>Pavilion of the Morning,</hi> where in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
there were ſome of the moſt able Maſters
of Inſtrumental Muſick, who diverted the
Court with their Conſorts for a Quarter of
an Hour, after which they continu'd their
Walk. When his Majeſty arriv'd at the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade</hi>
he heard the agreeable Noiſe of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Haut-Boys mixt with the Murmuring of
the Water; the <hi>Muſicians</hi> walking behind the
Hedge-Row, which kept them a long time
from being perceiv'd, and the ſame Diverſion
was renew'd in ſeveral Places of the Garden,
where the Flutes and Haut-Boys lay conceal'd
in the Thickets; in the <hi>Orange-Houſe</hi> his Majeſty
was Regal'd with a Conſort of Muſick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for that Occaſion. The Seats were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the Gallery that ends in the
<hi>Orange-Houſe,</hi> and was ſeparated from it by
large Pilaſters of Marble, leaning on Façades
to which five great Candleſticks were faſten'd,
it being already dark. The ſame Order was
obſerv'd throughout, and at the End of the
Place there appear'd two Benches or Stools,
on each ſide along the Declivity of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre,
above which there was a Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
All theſe Parts were lighted by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
number of little Lamps. The Fronts
and Pilaſters were adorn'd with flat Pieces of
Gold-Smiths Work, and Candleſticks for Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
the reſt of the <hi>Orange-Houſe</hi> was hung
with Tapeſtry repreſenting a Hunting Match,
and the twelve Months of the Year, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51877:127"/>
embelliſh'd with two Rows of Lamps from
one end to the other. The Conſort being
ended, his Majeſty came forth at a great
Door in the Middle of the <hi>Orange-Houſe,</hi> and
ſaw on his Right-hand ſeveral Walks of
Orange-Trees, adorn'd with a great number
of Lights plac'd before the Boxes; And
after he had march'd about 30 Paces in
in one of thoſe Walks, he diſcover'd a Table
in a Green Arbour. The Table was four
Foot and three Inches broad, reaching quite
round the Canal, but cover'd only in thoſe
places that were under the Arbours on the
Banks of the Canal, to the Angles on thoſe
parts of the Flanks that were form'd into an
Amphitheatre, deſcending by three Degrees
towards the Water. The King took his Seat
at the Table in the Midſt of an Arbour, at
one of the Ends of the Canal, and the
<hi>Dauphin</hi> was plac'd in the oppoſite Arbour,
ſo that there were 38 Foot of Water between
'em; the two ſides of the Table were adorn'd
with a Wreath of Baskets and Veſſels of
<hi>Porcelane</hi> full of Flowers, between the branch'd
Candleſticks, and other Machines of Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths-Work
carrying 25 Tapers; beſides
which there were others ſomewhat lower.
The Machines of Light were all of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Contrivance, repreſenting his Majeſty's
Actions under Allegorical Figures; and the
other two Degrees were adorn'd after the
the ſame Manner. The Arbours at each End
of the Canal, which cover'd the two parts
of the Table where his Majeſty and the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:51877:128"/>
ſate, were 18 Foot high, being arch'd
after the manner of a Porch, and ſo artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
contriv'd, that the Cornices and other
parts of the Architecture were eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd.
The Plafond of the place where the
King ſate was encompaſs'd with a rais'd
Work, but thoſe of the two Wings were flat,
and all the <hi>Portico's</hi> were arch'd and adorn'd
with his Majeſty's Arms and Cyphers in the
Middle. Several Buſts and Garlands of
Flowers hung alſo in the Middle of the
Arches, and the King's Arbour was cover'd
with the like Ornaments. All the Cornices
were border'd with 150 branch'd Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
bearing ſix Tapers each, with a ſilver
Basket full of Flowers between every two
Candleſticks. All the Arches were furniſh'd
with Damask Curtains, ty'd back to the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſters,
to preſerve the Company from Rain,
if there ſhou'd be occaſion; and over-againſt
the ſides of the Table there were two Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards
of State, ſupported by great Arches,
and crown'd with Arbours, containing 20
Foot in Front, and riſing by three Degrees,
adorn'd with Multiplying-Glaſſes, beſides ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Curious Pieces of Gold and Silver-Work,
among which there was a great number of
branch'd Candleſticks, carrying ſeveral Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and beſides they were border'd with
Boxes of Orange-Trees. The Entertainment
conſiſted of five Courſes of the rareſt Kinds
of Meat and Fruit which cou'd be procur'd
in that Seaſon. The King was ſerv'd by the
Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay,</hi> the <hi>Dauphineſs</hi> by <hi>le
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51877:128"/>
Bailly Colbert,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> by
the Marqueſs <hi>de Blainville;</hi> and at the other
end the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi> by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>de Maulevrier,</hi> During the Repaſt,
they were by turns diverted with the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Sounds of Trumpets, Violins, Flutes,
Hautboys, and Kettle-Drums; and at the
ſame time there were two Tables prepar'd
in the Caſtle, with twenty or thirty cover'd
Places at each, for Perſons of Quality at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
on the Court; and ſeveral others were
plac'd in the Garden and Court for the
Officers, not forgetting even the Foot-men.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplaying
his Magnificence at Home, his
Brother-in-Law the Duke <hi>de Mortemar,</hi> gave
illuſtrious Proofs of his Vigour and Conduct
in the Treaty which he concluded with
the Pyrates of <hi>Tripoli.</hi> He arriv'd before
that Place the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1686, and
ſent ſuch a peremptory Letter to the <hi>Dey,</hi>
that he aſſembl'd the <hi>Divan</hi> the ſame Day;
where 'twas reſolv'd to grant all that the
Duke demanded, excepting only the entire
Payment of the 60000 Crowns, being part
of the Summ which they were oblig'd to
pay by the Treaty concluded in 1685: For
they were not then able to advance ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
a Summ, by reaſon of their bad
Harveſt, and of the Civil War that had ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs'd
their Country ſince that time, and
was juſt then terminated by the Death of
the <hi>Dey,</hi> whom the <hi>Moors</hi> endeavour'd to
make Sovereign of the Country. In the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51877:129"/>
mean time they laded one of the King's
Ships with <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orn; and ſince they cou'd not
reſtore ſeven of the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> that were
ask'd of 'em, whom they had ſold in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts of the <hi>Levant,</hi> from whence
they cou'd not poſſibly bring 'em back,
they deliver'd thirty Strangers inſtead of the
twenty <hi>French</hi> Slaves that were demanded
of 'em, with eleven young Ship-Boys of
<hi>Provence,</hi> whom they had forc'd to renounce
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which they had never before
granted by any Treaty whatſoever. The
Duke <hi>de Mortemar</hi> at his Arrival, found five
<hi>Venetian</hi> Men of War and Fly-Boats that
were come to Land the Gariſon and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Navarrens</hi> and <hi>Modon,</hi> which were
ſurrenderd on Articles to the <hi>Generaliſſimo
Moroſini.</hi> The Commander of this Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
had retain'd ſome Women, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
that they were willing to embrace the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith; and the <hi>Dey</hi> of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> on the
Complaints made to him by the Husbands
and Relations of thoſe Women, had, by
way of Reprizal, ſeiz'd on the whole Crew
of a Pinnace belonging to the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
But the Difference was accommodated by
the Duke's Mediation, the Women being
reſtor'd to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the Mariners of
the Pinnace to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> After which
the Duke wrote to the <hi>Dey</hi> of <hi>Tunis,</hi> who
ſent in the Veſſel call'd the <hi>Granade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
the reſt of the Slaves that were taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the <hi>Dey, Divan,</hi> and Soldiery of <hi>Tripoli</hi> ſent
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51877:129"/>
to <hi>France, Khelyt Aga</hi> the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Deputy,
and <hi>Hector Aga,</hi> a Naval Officer, to preſent
to his Majeſty, by way of Tribute, two
Dromedaries, ſix of the fineſt Horſes in the
Country, and ſome Oſtriches. Theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys
arriv'd at <hi>Toulon</hi> on the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>May,
1687,</hi> where they were receiv'd by <hi>Vauvre,</hi>
Intendant of the Marine, and maintain'd at
the King's Charge, with their eight Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
during the forty Days they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in that Place, to repoſe themſelves
and thoſe Animals who had ſuffer'd very
much in the Voyage. At laſt they ſet
forward by an Order from the Court, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
by <hi>de Magrie,</hi> a Marine Officer
in the <hi>Toulon</hi> Diviſion, and <hi>Antonio Boyer,</hi> a
Native of <hi>Malta,</hi> to perform the Office of
an Interpreter on the Road. On the <hi>10th.</hi>
of <hi>Auguſt</hi> they came to <hi>Charenton,</hi> and <hi>de
Magna</hi> went immediately to inform the
Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay</hi> of their Arrival. The
<hi>22d.</hi> they were brought to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and
introduc'd to his Majeſty's Preſence by the
Marqueſs. After they had made their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
in <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> which was interpreted
by <hi>Dipy,</hi> they preſented the Animals to the
King; after which a <hi>Moor</hi> about eighteen
Years old, of a very large Stature both for
height and thickneſs, mounted one of the
Dromedaries, harneſs'd after the Mode of
the Country, and galloping about the Court,
he rais'd himſelf with wonderful agility on
the Back of that Animal, and having made
ſeveral whirling Turns, fell back into his
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51877:130"/>
former Poſture. Some Days after the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
went to ſee the Marqueſs <hi>de Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelay</hi>'s
Houſe, where they were regal'd by
his Officers, tho' they had receiv'd neither
Orders for the Entertainment, nor ſo much
as Notice of their coming. At their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
the Marqueſs gave each of 'em
in the King's Name, a Gold Chain and
Medal, with his Majeſty's Picture.</p>
            <p>In <hi>October</hi> 1689, the Marqueſs <hi>de Seigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay</hi>
was made Miniſter of State; but he
did not long enjoy that Dignity, for he
dy'd the next Year, three Months after the
<hi>Dauphineſs,</hi> as his Father deceas'd ſome Days
after the Queen. His Death was believ'd
to be occaſion'd by his Debauches, and
eſpecially by the Exceſſes he committed
with Women. He was extremely in Love
with one of his Miſtreſſes, but did not
take care to raiſe her Fortune, tho' it was
not ſuitable to her Birth. When ſhe was
inform'd that there was no hope of his
Recovery, and that he ſuffer'd no Ladies
to be brought into his Preſence, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
her ſelf in the Habit of a Courier,
and pretending that ſhe had a Pacquet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſome important Affair to deliver
to the Marqueſs. She was introduc'd into
his Chamber, where ſhe diſcover'd her ſelf
to him, and told him, that hearing he was
about to undertake a long Journey, ſhe
cou'd not forbear bidding him adieu before
his departure; and withal, intreated him to
remember her Condition. He eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:51877:130"/>
her meaning, but having more preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Debts to pay, ſent her away with a
Promiſe that he would think of her. The
Abbot <hi>de Fenelon</hi> gave him notice of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Death; and he was ſo much the
more ſurpriz'd with ſo unwelcom a Meſſage,
that two Days before he had ſpent eight
Hours in doing Buſineſs with his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.
His Body being open'd, there were
found twelve ſmall and very hard Glands
in his Breaſt, and the Rudiments of ſome
others in his Kindneys; his Lungs were
found ſticking to his Sides, all his Blood
was congeal'd, and his Stomach ſo hard,
that they cou'd not open it without ſome
difficulty. The Inventory of his Eſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to 1700000 Livres, and might
have been much greater, if his Expences
had been leſs extravagant. He left five
Boys, of whom the eldeſt, call'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>de Loure,</hi> being then about ſeven or
eight Years old, ſome time after obtain'd
the Reverſion of the Office of Maſter of
the Wardrobe, at preſent in the poſſeſſion
of the Marqueſs <hi>de la Sale.</hi>

               <hi>Lewis Phelippeaux,</hi> Count of <hi>Pontchartrain,</hi>
was made Miniſter and Secretary of State,
in room of the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay.</hi> He
had already paſs'd thro' the Offices of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor
in the Court of Requeſts in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Paris,</hi> Maſter of Requeſts, Firſt
Preſident in the Parliament of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and
Intendant of the <hi>Finances,</hi> and was then
(as he is ſtill) Comptroller-General of the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51877:131"/>
               <hi>Finances.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> had the
Titles of Governour of the Fortifications of
Maritime places, and of the ancient Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications;
Great Maſter of the Races, and
Director of the Cloth-Manufactory. And
the Office of Commander and Great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
of the King's Orders, formerly in the
poſſeſſion of the Marqueſs <hi>de Seigdelay,</hi> was
given to his Uncle, the Marqueſs <hi>de Croiſſy,</hi>
Miniſter and Secretary of State. Of all
<hi>Colbert</hi>'s Sons, at preſent there are only two
remaining, <hi>James Nicholas,</hi> Archbiſhop of
<hi>Rohan,</hi> and <hi>Lewis,</hi> formerly Abbot of <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi>
and Prior of <hi>Nogent le Rotru,</hi> who after
the Death of his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> Count <hi>de
Sceaux,</hi> who was kill'd in <hi>Flanders</hi> at the
Head of the Regiment of <hi>Champaign,</hi> left a
Religious for a Military Life, and was
made Commander of the ſame Regiment
which the Marqueſs <hi>de Blanville</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
before him.</p>
