            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Iesuit</hi> who occasioned my first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to you in this way, has by <hi>his</hi> Letter, mov'd me to give you this Second trouble: Perhaps it may be the last in this kind; for I do not envy him the Honour of throwing the first, and the second, and the third handful of Dirt. I am unawares ensnared into the most disagreeable Employment of <hi>defending</hi> and <hi>proving</hi>: But this I have to offer in just Excuse, That I went in the simplicity of a Christian, as to a Private Discourse, which the Arts of others have
<pb facs="tcp:51279:4"/>
improv'd into a Publick Brawl. I will not so much suspect your Sagacity, as to imagine you do not guess at the reason why my self, and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men, are on this manner treated; why that Reverend Person, the <hi>Dean of St. Paul</hi>'s, is here <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Remarks, <hi>p.</hi> 38.</note> call'd, <hi>most disingenuous</hi>; and elsewhere egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously slander'd, as one <note n="(b)" place="margin">Concl. of <hi>Pax Vobis.</hi>
               </note> who has exchanged <hi>Christianity</hi> for <hi>Paganism</hi>: Why the <hi>Reverend Dean of Canterbury</hi> has been in terms revil'd, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Reason and Antiquity, <hi>p.</hi> 45.</note> as a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>void</hi> of <hi>Modesty, Charity, Sincerity,</hi> and <hi>good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>: Why the Reverend Mr. <hi>Wake</hi> 
               <note n="(d)" place="margin">A Reply to the Def. of the Expos. of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> has been <hi>just now</hi> accused of <hi>Calumnies, Unsincerities, willful Mistakes,</hi> and <hi>Plain Contradictions.</hi> You can well understand, that this <hi>Work</hi> is laid before us for the hindering of <hi>better</hi>; and that they say this Ill of us, not because we are <hi>such,</hi> but because we are not <hi>theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> (in his Letter to you) is unwilling to believe that any <hi>Romanists</hi> spread false stories of me; yet I have spoken with great numbers of you who have <hi>heard</hi> them, from the mouths of the <hi>less generous</hi> of them, in publick places. In due time they may call in question <hi>that sense</hi> too.</p>
            <p>He tells you further of Letters sent into the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>West</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in which He and his Brethren were <hi>misreported.</hi> If such Papers were sent, I did no more, either by direct, or indirect
<pb facs="tcp:51279:4"/>
Order, occasion the writing of them, than I have subscribed <hi>Pope Pius</hi>'s <hi>Creed.</hi> This matter had been more probably laid, if he had mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other Points of the Compass, and told of Letters sent into those parts of <hi>England</hi> where I have liv'd. For (I imagine) he does not take <hi>NOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FOLK</hi> for a <hi>Northern</hi> County.</p>
            <p>He speaks (here) of <hi>Bitterness</hi> and <hi>Scurrility,</hi> and tells the World elsewhere, he has <hi>not gall enough for me</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s Rem. <hi>p.</hi> 32.</note>, tho he seems at present troubled with the <hi>over-flowing of it.</hi> And yet the provocation was only this <hi>great Truth,</hi> That his Patient, <hi>I. S.</hi> grew worse under his hands. <hi>I. S.</hi> is now under better. I voluntarily own'd what I then thought less decent, and have accounted for it; and I have been, by my Friends, reprov'd for making <hi>Apologies</hi> in my Epistle Dedicatory, for <hi>Warmnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> which, they say, they cannot find in the Book.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iesuit</hi> would fix that <hi>Indignation</hi> which I speak of to you, upon <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> when in express words, I make the Objects of it to be <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Injustice.</hi> And perceiving <hi>in him</hi> too great a Degree of those Evils, my resentment, such as it was, was reasonable. And for my <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> it offer'd me a wholesom Admonition, when I met with a second <hi>Gubbard,</hi> who attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:51279:5"/>
to take away, I do not say, the <hi>Fleeces,</hi> but those things which have ever been much dearer to me, <hi>the Souls of my Sheep.</hi> This he, and his Friend <note n="(a)" place="margin">Advice to the <hi>Pulpits, p.</hi> 26, 27, 28, 29.</note> (who in part repeats him, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges) has constru'd, as a <hi>Grudge,</hi> and a <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> of <hi>thirty years standing,</hi> and an impotence in retaining a <hi>Childish</hi> impression for so many years: But 'tis no more <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Childishness,</hi> than for one, who, in his Youth, has read the History of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and hates the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to think of it a-fresh, when he sees a man invading his <hi>own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the future, seeing I now know him better than at first I did; and have found him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a serious Schollar, a man of Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and Jocular Humour, <note n="(b)" place="margin">See his Rem. <hi>p.</hi> 36.</note> in <hi>misrepresenting</hi> and <hi>exposing</hi>; I shall do Justice upon him, by that which (I hope) is no unbecoming <hi>Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on, but steps into a great Mistake, by saying, I pretend to prove, that Mr. <hi>Gub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi> was a <hi>Priest, by his favour with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</hi> For, besides that I <hi>there</hi> pretend not to such a Proof, otherwise than the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Relation prove it; I have said, That the Committee, who put him in as a <hi>Protestant Dissenter,</hi> put him out, when they
<pb facs="tcp:51279:5"/>
discover'd him to be a <hi>Roman.</hi> The Grounds upon which they went, may, in time, be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</p>
            <p>But he tells you, he might have preached up <hi>Purgatory,</hi> (which, by the way, was not the openest Point he preached) without being a <hi>Romanist</hi>: And in one sense I allow it; for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> argues for a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> from the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Virgil</hi>; but it was not certainly that <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> out of which men are relieved by <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> And such a Purgatory (notwithstanding Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s Suggestion) Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> could not hold; having forbidden his <hi>Nieces</hi> to <hi>marry</hi> with any who should go to <hi>Mass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did he, in Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s way, desire an <hi>Ora pro Animâ, to be engraved on his Tomb.</hi> For he imitated some Christians about the <hi>Fourth Age,</hi> who <hi>wish'd Rest</hi> to none but those who, as they thought, already enjoy'd it. And even this <hi>Wish</hi> of theirs, if it had <hi>Charity,</hi> it had also (in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) <hi>weakness</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>That which follows concerns the <hi>suffering of his Family</hi> (in the Evil Times); from the Honour of which I desire not to detract. It seems by his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the <hi>Spirit of persecution</hi> has not confin'd it self to the <hi>Established Church,</hi> which, so far as I can understand the Temper of it, had rather suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

injuries than do them. That you may conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nue in the safe bosom of this <hi>Apostolical Church,</hi> is, and shall be my most importunate Address to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God in your behalf, as being,</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> consider'd in his Certificates.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Iesuit</hi> has usher'd in his <hi>Second Pamphlet</hi> with a pompous Company of <hi>Testimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi>; With Testimonies in <hi>Favour</hi> of <hi>A. P.</hi> A new stile in <hi>Certificates,</hi> which ought to be written, either without <hi>Fear, Affection,</hi> or <hi>Favour.</hi> There was as little necessity for <hi>any</hi> of them, as there is sincerity in <hi>some.</hi> For I affirm'd, from very good Evidence, That several Persons enter'd with him; but I repeated it in the Second Page of my Account, that I did not say <hi>they were all of Mr.</hi> Pulton'<hi>s bringing.</hi> Nor did I affirm there was one <hi>Iesuit</hi> there besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: For certainly <hi>all Orders</hi> are not swallow'd up in <hi>his,</hi> how widely soever he may open for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>I do not dispute either the <hi>L. S. I</hi>'s, or the <hi>Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>'s Certificate; but if others under his Obedience have the like <hi>Sincerity</hi> with Mr. <hi>Pulton,</hi> they may have been there, without saying they were so, as well as <hi>Katharine Lamb</hi> might not at first be there, yet say she was.</p>
            <p>Well; his false <hi>Quotations</hi> will not be swallow'd, and now his Refuge is <hi>Certificates.</hi> But they have likewise fail'd him. And he that reads the <hi>following Testimonies,</hi> and enquires after the Integrity of those who subscrib'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51279:8"/>
them, and the Capacity they have been in of knowing the Truth; and considers the little Reason they have had to expose themselves to the ill will of many, if their love of Truth would have suffer'd them to be private: Such a person (I say) for the <hi>buying of Truth,</hi> will not be apt to go to Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> to purchase it. And when our Dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>putant lays his hand upon his heart, and reflects in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian manner upon this insincerity, he will (I hope) make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a moreopen acknowledgment for a publick Scandal, than an Auricular Confession can amount to. And let him henceforth forbear his Raillery about <hi>Katharine Boren,</hi> left he put people in mind of <hi>Katharine Lamb.</hi> This <hi>Katharine Lamb,</hi> for ought I know, may be a vertuous and true Woman. But as <hi>She</hi> is represented in Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s <hi>Certificate,</hi> she is a very extraordinary person. Certainly she must have some Relation to that Famous Dr. <hi>Lamb,</hi> whom the <hi>Mobile</hi> believ'd to be a <hi>Conjurer:</hi> For to be in a Room kept on purpose private, by Mrs. <hi>R.</hi> till D.<hi>T.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> should come in, and neither to be seen by her or him; or, in her passage, by any of the Family; if it has nothing in it of one <hi>Black Art,</hi> I'm sure in the telling it, it has something of <hi>another.</hi> If she was there, she must have come in by some unsuspected way, such as the Chimney, or the Key-hole: And if there she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, she must have put her self into the shape of some such thing as a Table, a Chair, or a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Long-Acre Miracle</hi> will not pass, nor make many Conversions. For the People understand, that if <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine Lamb</hi> did not certifie this, there's <hi>Forgery</hi> in it; and if she did, there is <hi>False Evidence.</hi> Now this, as our Representer pleases to speak, of a <hi>Query,</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">(2) Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s Rem. <hi>p. 35.</hi>
               </note> is a <hi>Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beast</hi> of an Argument. It is a curst <hi>Dilemma,</hi> which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51279:8"/>
hath long Horns, and let him take heed that they do not push him.</p>
            <p>But let us see what Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> himself says to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for he is an Artist at mending a business, by making more holes in it. On <hi>Novemb.</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> he Publish'd his <hi>Remarks.</hi> That Night the false Certificate of <hi>Katharina in Nubibus,</hi> was publickly expos'd. This came to his Ear, and it was, no doubt, as welcome to him as the <hi>next days History.</hi> On the Lord's day following, in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon (the better the day, the worse the deed), he closes his Sermon with this <hi>Iargon,</hi> not deliver'd without a <hi>Concern</hi> in his <hi>Looks,</hi> and <hi>Disorder</hi> in his <hi>Voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I was <hi>mistaken</hi> this Week in one thing of my last Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which, tho true, yet I had it not from the person's own hand, tho it came as if it came from them: It is about one of the Evidences, or Testimonials, which I shall clear by a <hi>Printed Paper</hi> to morrow, and satisfie therein about it The thing I say is true, but the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence not made by the Person to me, tho it came as from their own hands. But I shall give an account of it to morrow by a <hi>Printed Paper.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now commend me to the Infallible man, who <hi>was thus mistaken</hi>; to the man who will be plain in nothing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to me. <hi>He</hi> is the man in the World who is good at a <hi>Conclusion.</hi> He is that Wise man in my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says,</hi> who reserves his great business for a <hi>Postscript.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is concern'd in a false way; let him neither dance, nor dance in a Net; for he is seen through his Cover, and he shews his halting as often as he stirs.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Famous Paper</hi> he promis'd to publish the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next day, with such Solemnity; no Person; that I can hear of, has ever yet beheld it, tho inquiry after it has not been wanting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:51279:9"/>And now I have greater Compassion than ever for deluded <hi>I. S.</hi> for he hapned upon a man, who, if he is a Lover of Truth, has a very notable Art in concealing his Affection.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>CUrsory Notes</hi> have already been made both upon the <hi>Iesuit</hi>'s <hi>True</hi>; and his <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Full Account</hi>: And I do not yet see any great Reason given by him for the blotting out of a single line. Something, hovvever, may be added, seeing he has been pleas'd to make both Additions and Alterations. He has added an <hi>Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and a <hi>Preface</hi>; and in both of them he is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant man. In his <hi>Advertisement</hi> he excuses his false <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> by his having been Eighteen Years out of <hi>England</hi>; And yet he can write <hi>two English</hi> Books in a few Weeks, and in one of them, use <hi>three</hi> several Stiles. I do not enquire whereabouts he has liv'd: one would think by his <hi>Narratives</hi> and <hi>Certificates,</hi> that he has liv'd among the <hi>Cretians.</hi> But seeing he speaks <hi>English</hi> as readily as any man, it may reasonably be demanded, how, in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, a man of his <hi>Profession,</hi> retains the <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> and loses the <hi>Grammar</hi> of his Native Language? Now, perceiving that the <hi>Printers</hi> are become Criticks in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, he sends me a Challenge to dispute with him in <hi>Latin. Latin,</hi> it seems, is so belov'd a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that he chuses to have both <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in that Tongue, for the Edification of the People; for certainly the Learned have no need of our assistance; I fear we may rather become their sport.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51279:11"/>After this, our Champion advanceth with his <hi>Preface,</hi> and there he imitates the ruggider Duellists, who, without any Embraces, make fierce passes at one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>He accuses me of <hi>Mistakes,</hi> and <hi>Misrepresentations,</hi> and want of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> not thinking of his own guilt, whilst he traduces his Neighbour. Nay, I am become so potent in these Arts, that I have confounded the whole matter, <hi>and truly</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">M. <hi>P</hi>'s True and full Account. Ep. to the Reader.</note> 
               <hi>inverted</hi> the <hi>whole Order</hi> of the <hi>Conference.</hi> I have done a wondrous thing in represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as Confusion which was so: By whose means, the unbyass'd can tell.</p>
            <p>But what, if in the little method that was us'd, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> himself should be the man who has <hi>inverted the Order?</hi> Why then, he wants either <hi>Memory</hi> or <hi>Sincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after having spoken of the Words of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> he introduces the story of <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Courtezans. This was mention'd at the beginning, and St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end. And if the setting of the last first, and the first last, be Order, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> is a man of Method, and no <hi>Inverter.</hi> But perhaps it was in him a Point of Good Manners, to set St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> before <hi>Luther,</hi> and let it go so. Of this true Relation he says, that D. <hi>T. recounted he knows not what Story of some Priest at</hi> Rome. And yet the Story is told as plainly as a Story can be told, and it needs no Interpreter.

               <hi>offering at another long passage in</hi> Luther'<hi>s Works</hi>; and yet it was a Story out of the <hi>Acts</hi> of his beloved <hi>Second Synod</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> as set forth by the <hi>Iesuites Labbe</hi> and <hi>Cossart.</hi> If the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Collection of Councils, and Popes Epistles and Decrees, be <hi>Luther</hi>'s Works, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> are in a marvellous <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51279:11"/>
which none of them know of. This is a Discovery worthy the invention of the <hi>invisible Catharine.</hi> But why is my <hi>I know not what Story of a Priest,</hi> so very idle? He gives a false Account of <hi>Luther</hi>'s leaving the <hi>Mass,</hi> and I requite him with a true one. He from <hi>Luther</hi>'s bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Adversaries, and I from <hi>Luther</hi> himself. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants thought it not at all amiss, that I should give him an <hi>Allen</hi> for his <hi>Duncomb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to come to his <hi>Artifice.</hi> He sends me his <hi>Second Narrative</hi> in Writing. He expects my <hi>Notes</hi> upon it. He desires, in order to his easier finding of my Objections, that I will observe the Numbers of his Paragraphs <note n="(b)" place="margin">See his Letter here published, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.</note>. I do this little Service for him.

               <hi>Observe here the Fidelity either of Mr.</hi> P'<hi>s Memory, or his Conscience.</hi> 
               <q>He, says the Dr. told a Story of some Priest at <hi>Rome,</hi> who having pronounced the Words of Consecration, was heard to say aloud, That he believed not as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church obliged.

            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this, without any notice given me, or any acknowledgment in either of his Books, he (besides many other Variations, not so material) makes in Print, this alteration from the <hi>MS.</hi> he sent me: <q>He recounted I know not what Story of some Priest at <hi>Rome,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the words of Consecration, was heard to say, <hi>Bread thou art, and Bread thou shalt be; Wine thou art,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To what end do you imagine is this Alteration made without giving any notice? Is it not that Readers obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51279:12"/>
               <hi>first</hi> the Words I cite, as <hi>his,</hi> and then perusing his <hi>Account,</hi> and finding in it, that I tax him with failure in Memory, or in Conscience, may be induc'd to think I <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifie</hi>? Some who came to me, pleas'd to use the freedom, for which I thank them, and to ask how this could come about? I show'd them the <hi>Account</hi> in MS. which Mr. <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> sent me, and compar'd it with the Account which he had Printed, and they were satisfied about the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>fullness</hi> of his Narrative.

            <p>But he must not arrogate to himself this <hi>Artifice</hi>: It is an old Invention; and I am going about to give a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Instance of it in the case of the <hi>Reverend,</hi> the <hi>Learned,</hi> and (that for which I most esteem him) the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> He had cited a Passage out of Mr. <hi>White</hi>; the Leaf was cut out, and another pasted in; and then the Dr. was charg'd by his Adversary <hi>W.

               <head>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s own Relation, entitled, <hi>A Brief Account of one Suggestion of the</hi> Romanist.</head>
               <p n="1">1 IT is the Statesman's Maxim concerning a false Suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That if it be believed but Four and Twenty Hours, the Value of it is inestimable, which tho it must be allow'd to receive a grand Abatement, when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to inferiour, and less considerable Transactions; yet the Interests of Religion, in the maintenance of Truth, are not so dispisable, as that he that hath appear'd, or embarked in them, can safely neglect the advantages which evil Arts may yield, or furnish an Adversary against him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such in Reason, and in Experience, beyond all others, is the Charge of <hi>falsifying</hi>; which if it be but suggested, and believed of any, and much more if a pregnant and visible Proof of it be tender'd, there needs no other Blast, or Smut, or Vermine, to lay waste the whole Field, and deprive him of all Harvest of his Seed and Labours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How this is my Concernment at this time, the Reader will not suddenly divine, till I have entertain'd him with a short Relation of that which I had rather my self <hi>proclaim</hi> on the <hi>House-top,</hi> than leave others to whisper it in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I was lately advertised by a Judicious and Reverend Friend, that it was particularly urged against me, by a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manist,</hi> That I had mistaken, or perverted Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s Words, which I refer to, in <hi>The Dispatcher Dispatch't,</hi> Chap. 3. Sect. 4. <hi>p.</hi> 279. where I suppose him to answer (in his Apology for Tradition, <hi>p.</hi> 56.), That the Beatifical Vision of the Saints, before the Day of Judgment, was not yet held a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51279:13"/>
matter of Faith, but only a Theological Conclusion; when (said he) the Apology in that very place, had expresly said, <q>That this Point is a matter of Faith, grounded on Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not a Theological Conclusion.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That I should be guilty, of but of such an Oscitancy, or Mistake, much more of such a vile perversion as this, I may be allow'd to have been as unwilling my self to believe, as I am oblig'd to take care, that others should not causlesly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it of me: Therefore without delay, I turn'd first to mine own Words (which as I then could not doubt, so now I acknowledge to be faithfully related), then to Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s Words, in the Page of his Apology, whence I had cited them; and those I found exactly, and to a Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant to my Transcript of them, in the <hi>Dispatcher Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch't.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. For thus I still read (if I will not at Noon-day suspect mine own Eyes) in that Apologist, <hi>p.</hi> 56. <hi>l.</hi> 12. [<hi>For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more clear, than that the Validity of Baptism by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks was a Tradition, and decided by it: So the Beatifical Vision of the Saints, before the Day of Iudgment, the Spirituality of Angels, are not yet held matters of Faith, but only Theological Conclusions, as likewise the Souls being concreated to the perfecting of the Body.</hi>] What can be more manifest, than that in this Period <hi>the Beatifical Vision of Saints, before the Day of Iudgment,</hi> is by that Apologist set down, as one of the two things (to which after a third is subjoin'd) of which it is affirm'd in the Plural, that they <hi>are not yet held matters of Faith, but only The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological Conclusions</hi>? Which was all to a Syllable that I cited from him in that place, with this only change, that speaking only of <hi>one</hi> of these, <hi>the Beatifical Vision,</hi> &amp;c. I set it (
as it was necessary) in the Singular, <hi>is not yet held a matter of Faith, but only a Theological Conclusion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. That I might be sure not to have mistaken my Author, I carefully consulted the <hi>Errata,</hi> but there was none noted, relating to that Page: And indeed the whole Composure of the Period was such, that there must be a concurrence of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51279:13"/>
very many changes in the compass of very few lines (more, I believe, than the most negligent Compositor and Corrector have at any time conspir'd to be guilty of), to wrest this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony from me, or change it into what this <hi>Romanist</hi> had affirmed it to be.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Having dispatch'd this account to my Friend, from whom I received the former Advertisement, I had no cause of doubt, but that this affair had received its full Period, the <hi>Romanist</hi> being obliged to yeild to such full uncontrollable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and every man's Eyes, to whom the contrary Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion could be offered, being as well qualify'd as mine, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him from being misled by it. And on these grounds of safety I had <hi>no least</hi> thought of troubling the Reader with any Account, or Complaint, which I now see is become some part of my Interest and my Duty.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For I was soon assured by my Friend, that the Words which I had punctually transcribed from my Copy of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, were not to be found in that which he had before him, but quite transformed into the contrary sense, even that for which the <hi>Romanist</hi> had vouch'd them: For thus he found them [<hi>for nothing is more clear, than that the Validity of Baptism by Hereticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was a Tradition, and decided by it: So the Beatifical Vision of the Saints, before the Day of Iudgment. The Spirituality of Angels is not yet held a matter of Faith, but only a Theological Conclusion.</hi>]</p>
               <p n="10">10. By this Representation I was soon forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, That the whole Scene was changed, the first part of the Words remaining the same, but the second [<hi>of the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Vision of the Saints</hi>] which were my only Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wholly transform'd; that which before was join'd with the <hi>Spirituality of Angels, as not yet held matters of Faith, but only Theological Conclusions,</hi> being now annex'd to the <hi>Validity of Baptism by Hereticks,</hi> and so affirm'd to be a Tradition (and that is with him a matter of Faith), and decided by it: And then I had Reason to acknowledge
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51279:14"/>
the Candour of that <hi>Romanist,</hi> who proceeding on these Appearances, had laid no heavier a Censure upon me, than that of <hi>either mistaking, or perverting</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s <hi>Words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. In this new posture of Affairs, first it was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discernable, That the very many Changes, which I had foreseen, had been really made, to bring this about. And as all this was obvious, and credible to be done by a new Edition of the Book; so it remained uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to me, whether mine, or that other so contrary to it, were the True and Authentick Edition: This therefore was my next care to examine.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And herein again I met with an Intricacy; For if the Title-Pages, and a Concurrence of all obvious Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, might be believed, there was all this while but one Edition; both Copies carrying in their Front, <hi>A Paris, chez Iean Billain Rue S. Iacques à l'ensign S. Austin,</hi> 1654. the same Volume, Print, Number of Pages, beginning and end of every Page, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This soon suggested that which was the only clue to extricate me then (and the Reader now) out of this Labyrinth. For sending to the <hi>Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners</hi> for another Copy of the Apology, as from one, I received a Copy perfectly agreeing with mine, so by the help of another, I was furnish't with one exactly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to what my Monitor, from the <hi>Romanist,</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to me, yet not discernably differing from my own in any other, save in this one Passage; and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more narrowly, first, the Paper and Ink, wherein the Leaf was Printed (discernibly differing from all the rest of the Book), was apt to inject some suspicion: But I soon saw that I had no need of this, or other obscurer intimation, it being grosly visible, that in this place a Leaf had been cut out, and a new one pasted in. And what Gordian Knot might not have been untied by the like instrument?</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51279:14"/>13. When this change was thought fit to be made, I did, and still want Augury to divine; only this is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that it was a Work which Second thoughts sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, after the Book was published; else my Copy, which came regularly to me from the <hi>Worcester Stationer</hi> (in the Year, if my Memory fail me not, 1655.) and another now sent me from another <hi>Stationer</hi> (which assures me, there be many more) must have had their parts in the Change.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Having given the Reader a brief and single view of this matter, I abstain from any farther Observation, or Reflection on it, than what a <q>Quo teneam vultus mutantem—?</q> will amount to. But that is also unnecessary, my whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign being compleated in this, That it is now manifest to the most imperswasible of their Disciples, that dare read what is written against their Masters (which I perceive few are permitted to do), That I neither mistook, nor perverted the Apologist's Sense or Words, those, I mean, which I read in his Book, from which alone I could be imagined to receive cognizance of them, not being able to forecast, that what I had thus really transcrib'd from him, would be so soon snatch't from me again, or that what was to me so visible, should vanish, and become invisible to other men.</p>
               <p n="15">15. This indeed is an unexpected Proof of what <hi>S. W.</hi> had told me concerning the Wits (enormous) Power to transform Testimonies; which yet shall not discourage me from dealing in that Ware (being firmly resolved never to make use of my duller Faculties, to work such Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoses), nor yet from diverting sometimes into such pleasant Fields, adorned with so great Varieties, as that. Apologist frequently affords the World, hoping that I shall not again meet with such misadventures as these, or any
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51279:15"/>
greater interruptions in reading him, than what a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Attention, and a Table of <hi>Errata,</hi> shall enable me to overcome.</p>
               <p n="16">16. This Account, I conceived, would more pardonably, because more moderately, divert the Reader at this time, than if I should stay till it were solemnly and articulately call'd for, and moreover, deliver <hi>S. W.</hi> from some temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, himself to think, or to perswade others, that he had sprang some real Game to invite his Chases, some Guilt to support his Contumelies, and perhaps prevail with some of their most credulous followers, to think it equitable to subject the Suggestions they meet with, to some other ways of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination and Trial, than the bare Authority or Confidence of the Suggesters.</p>

            <p>My Reason is this: God used <hi>Luther</hi> as an Instrument of bringing forth the <hi>Bible</hi> from under that Rubbish of <hi>Canonists</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> which had hid it from the World. The <hi>Roman Doctors</hi> did not put the <hi>Bible</hi> into <hi>Luther</hi>'s Hands, but he found it by God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in a Library, where he look'd not for it.

                        <p>THE Author pretends, that the Jesuits of <hi>Germany</hi> first began to wrangle, upon this <hi>Dispute</hi> of <hi>Luther with the Devil</hi>; and that they did not so much as think of any such thing, till more <hi>than sixty Years</hi> after that was published. So then, according to his Reckoning, 'tis a <hi>Cheat</hi> of more than <hi>fourscore Years,</hi> since that <hi>Luther</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd the first Account of it, in the Year 1533; and they who know the humour of the Controvertists, are not at al surpriz'd at the bustle they have made upon that Subject; but they rather wonder, that it had not been long before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd to Protestants, that the Devil was the Author of their Doctrine, since none but he instructed <hi>Luther</hi> to contest the Holy and Divine Sacrifice of the Mass. Besides, 'tis easy to guess at those moral Reflections which follow the Train of these vile Imputations, <hi>viz.</hi> That God, whose Providence is ever watchful for the good of his Church, has permitted this wretched Arch-Heretick to discover himself, that so the Catholicks may be the more confirmed in the Faith, and have new occasion offer'd to wonder at the blindness, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal obstinacy that do's attend all Hereticks and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: The Author supposeth, that the Advantage which they will have Providence to have managed for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licism, by the manifestation of this Dispute of <hi>Luther,</hi> is not bounded there: he imagines that they pretend thereby to render all Protestants unworthy of humane Pity or Compassion, and to expose them to the rigor of the Laws made against those who voluntarily, and by premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated design, subject themselves to the desires of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: He further insinuates to us, that the Abbot of <hi>Cordemoy</hi>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:51279:20"/>
affects to render the Calvinists Accomplices of the Lutherans upon no other account, than to [render them more odious]. And if he engages to answer him, 'tis chiefly to the end, that the Protestants of <hi>Germany</hi> may understand, that Popery is always ill-intentioned against them; and that they have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to fear every thing, if they once fall into the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with the Provinces which have been dismembred from the Empire. I cannot believe that this Abbot had a design to perswade the Higher Powers, that since the Calvinists adopt an Opinion, which <hi>Luther</hi> had learned of the Devil, and that they offer'd their Communion to the Lutherans, they ought to be punish'd as Agents of the Devil; but 'tis true, if we consider those studied Reflections and Invectives with which many Disputants have fraught their Disputes about this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of <hi>Luther,</hi> one would be easily induc'd to think, that their chief aim has been to let the World know that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants are the Disciples of a Demon, who spoke face to face with one of their Masters, without disguising his Quality; so that they are very near rank'd in the same Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis with those Men who study the Black Art, and are as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable as Magicians and Sorcerers; and as heretofore many of our Legislators (to gain to themselves greater Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) have sain'd I know not what Commerce with the Gods; So <hi>Luther</hi> came in like manner to say boldly, that he had learn'd of the Devil, that which he vented against the Mass. In which the Lutherans now fully justify themselves, and do not at all complain, as he who said,
<q>
                              <l>—Pudet haec approbria nobis</l>

<list>
                              <item>1. That <hi>Luther</hi> being fully perswaded that private Masses were good, he was set upon concerning this Point by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and that after having made what defence he could, he was at last forc'd to submit to the Reasons of this Spirit of Darkness.</item>
                              <item>2. That having been convinc'd by these Reasons, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished his Book against the Mass; and in all places where he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51279:20"/>
had Interest, made it to be laid aside — this is what his Accusers suppose, and without that, we cannot see how he was able to oppose the Mass under the Conduct, and by the Instructions of the Devil. Now Mr. <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> after many other great Divines of his Party, <hi>lets us clearly see,</hi> that the thing was not transacted after this manner.—There fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis a matter of Fact agreed on by all Men, that <hi>Luther</hi> had published nothing of this Conference before that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise which he caus'd to be printed in the Year 1533. And 'tis also certain that he remarks not the time when he was attack'd by the Devil: unless then the contrary is proved, the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> may suppose, that this Dispute happen'd in the same Year 1533. and this is what <hi>Balduinus</hi> highly supposes in a Treatise, which he has published upon this Subject against the Jesuit <hi>Serrarius</hi> in the Year 1605. if this Supposition passes, the Accusation falls to the ground, since that 'tis publickly known, that from the Year 1520. <hi>Luther</hi> had written Books against the <hi>Mass,</hi> and that in the Year 1530. it was both highly condemned and forbidden by the Confession of <hi>Augs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh.</hi> But taking the thing at the worst, it cannot be supposed, that this Dispute happen'd before the end of <hi>April</hi> 1522. and here is a demonstrative Proof of it. 'Tis certain that <hi>Luther</hi> was made Priest on the Sunday <hi>Cantate,</hi> the Year 1507. and that he confesses, that when he was attacked by the Devil, he had said Mass 15 entire Years, therefore it must necessarily be, that this Dispute hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd after the Sunday <hi>Cantate</hi> in the Year 1522. Now this Sunday falls out either about the end of <hi>April,</hi> or in the Month of <hi>May.</hi> If it be therefore found, that before the Month of <hi>May,</hi> 1522. <hi>Luther</hi> oppos'd the Mass with all the vigour imaginable, it will evidently follow, that his Dispute with the Devil did not determine him to that. Now these are the Arguments which Mr. <hi>Sagittarius</hi> offers upon this Subject.</p>

                           <item>4. That 'tis most certainly known, that <hi>Luther</hi>'s Book against <hi>Ambrosius Catharinus</hi> was written by him in <hi>March</hi> 1521.—Now this is a Book where he speaks violently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Abuses of the Mass.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Sagittarius</hi> adds to this these three Considerations.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. That the <hi>Augustines</hi> of <hi>Wittemberg</hi> began the first of all to abolish private Masses, without imparting it to <hi>Luther</hi> in the Year 1521. which their Provincial Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd sometime after in respect of Votive Masses. <hi>Luther</hi> being yet in the Castle of <hi>Wittemberg</hi>: these are Matters of Fact, of which we have strong Proofs, and the Consequences whereof are not less strong against the Pretensions of those, who controvert this matter. For will they suppose also, that these <hi>Augustins</hi> had learn'd of the Devil what they thought false in the Mass.</item>
                           <item>2. The Author says in the second place, that <hi>Luther</hi> being come out of Custody, and preaching at <hi>Wittemberg</hi> the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1521. declared that tho the Mass was an impious and abominable thing, yet that he did condemn <hi>Carolostad,</hi> who excited Tumults to abolish it.</item>
                           <item>3. That <hi>Luther</hi> protested in the Book which he writ in the Month of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1522. against the King of <hi>England,</hi> that he holds his Doctrine from Heaven, and that he defended it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Temptations of the Devil. Now in this Treatise he discoursed chiefly of the Eucharist; if it be demanded to what purpose does the second Consideration serve to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Mr. <hi>Sagittarius?</hi> I answer, that he makes use of it to show, that the Devil had himself destroyed his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if he had excited <hi>Luther</hi> to the Abolition of the Mass, and if <hi>Luther</hi> at the same time did oppose those Advances, which <hi>Carolostad</hi> had made: Now Mr. <hi>Cordemoy</hi> pretends,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51279:21"/>
that the Evil Spirit would not ruin his own Work himself. The result of what has been hitherto read, is, That <hi>Luther</hi>'s Accusers have a little too much confounded the Account of Times; but they have yet much worse setled the state of the Controversy between this Doctor and the Devil; they have supposed it as a thing out of doubt, that what was disputed between these two Champions, was, to know, Whether pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Masses were good; and that <hi>Luther</hi> did maintain the Affirmative, but yielded to the weight of his Adversary's Objections. It was nothing less than this, if we believe Mr. <hi>Sagittarius; Luther</hi> did not deny to the Devil, that the Sacrifice of the Mass was a very ill thing; it was a Principle to which both Adversaries consented; but <hi>Luther</hi> would not admit of the Consequence which the Devil drew from thence, to wit, that a Man who had said Mass for 15 Years together, ought to consider himself as lost without Remedy. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil therefore had a design to raise a thousand Remorses, and a despairing confusion in the Soul of his Adversary: He on the other side sought for Excuses and Justifications, not for the Mass, but for the Fault he had done in celebrating of it; and in fine, all the Consolation that was left him, after that he had seen all that he could say for his Excuse, defeated by the Devil, was, that the Mercy of God, and the Death of Christ Jesus, would preserve him from the Damnation which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.—You see here two wonderful Differences betwixt the pretentions of the Lutherans, and those of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries; these pretend that the Dispute run only upon this Thesis, That private Masses are good, and that the Devil who took upon him the Office of an Opponent, confounded <hi>Luther.</hi> The others say, That the state of the Question was, Whether a Man who had said Mass for 15 Years, was a Sinner pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that <hi>Luther</hi> who was the Defendant, had been quite gravell'd, if it had not been that he alleadg'd the Merit of Jesus Christ, and the Mercy of God. Can any one consider such diversities of Opinion upon the same Matter of Fact, without adopting the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> 
                              <note n="(a)" place="margin">Nov. de Novemb. 1685 p. 1263.</note> concerning these Controvertists, <hi>Mutatis mutandis?</hi> The Author com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, That Mr. <hi>Cordemoy</hi> has omitted the last part of the Conference, where appears the design which the Devil had, and the Victory that <hi>Luther</hi> got over them.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51279:22"/>That which is very strange, is, That many eminent Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, <hi>Hospinian, Pareus,</hi> and one Modern that is yet of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Note than those, have confess'd, that the result of this Dispute, was the abbrogating of private Masses, so that they agree with the Controvertists of the Roman Party, That <hi>Luther</hi> overcome by the Reasons which the Devil laid before him, reform'd this part of Worship. Now this by no means appears in the account of the Conference, and is invincibly refuted by the Chronology which is above-mentioned. Who can we trust?</p>
                        <p>There is one other Remark that possibly may not be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; Mr. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Prej. Chap. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>Nicole</hi> had objected to the Protestants this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute of <hi>Luther,</hi> and has drawn a Consequence from it more odious than the Controvertists ever did. Mr. <note n="(c)" place="margin">Def. de lá repp. 2. P. ch. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>Claud</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd it, and among other things hath observ'd, that these Accusations of the Evil Spirit, were inward Impressions in the Heart of <hi>Luther.</hi> A Lutheran Minister also put forth an Answer to it; against which, a while after, they published a Book at <hi>Paris,</hi> and have added there a particular Reply <note n="(d)" place="margin">Elle a et è ajouteé á là 2. Edit. dep. Pres. en. 1683.</note> to Mr. <hi>Claud</hi> about this Conference; he complains that he had changed the Word <hi>of Dispute</hi> into that of Accusation. Others are offended with these words, <hi>en son coeur, i.e.</hi> in his Heart, which are not in the Latin; Mr. <hi>Sagittarius</hi> supplies wherewith to silence these Complaints; for besides what we have touch'd upon, he tells us, <hi>P.</hi> 5. that <hi>Iustus Ionas,</hi> who translated this piece of <hi>Luther</hi> into Latin, has suppress'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in the Original, and in particular these words, <hi>in corde meo,</hi> mu'tas enim Noctes mihi acerbas &amp; molestas fecit; which ought immediately to follow this — <hi>Satan mecum caepit ejusmodi disputationem.</hi> This <hi>Iustus Ionas</hi> was not Preceptor to <hi>Luther</hi>'s Son, but his Colleague in Divinity, from the Year 1522. <hi>Hospinian</hi> mistakes in this, and confounds him with another who was indeed his Preceptor, and who assisted with <hi>Iustus Ionas</hi> at <hi>Luther</hi>'s Death.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Sagittarius</hi> contents himself in this Particular, to say that Mr. <hi>Cordemoy</hi> has follow'd the Error of <hi>Hospinian,</hi> but it must be allow'd that throughout every place else he confutes him with a force that is a little too severe. § One of the places that deserves the greatest Consideration, is this, which shews the design that <hi>Luther</hi> had, when he composed that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51279:22"/>
Treatise, wherein we find an account of this Conference. By this means he overthrows all those confused Stories and Illusions which the Missionaries frame upon what <hi>Luther</hi> seems to answer sometimes, as being a good Catholick, tho his Expressions should seem to prove a great deal in this respect, and tho one should not acquiesce with the most probable sense which Mr. <hi>Sagittarius</hi> gives them, yet we must at least agree, that they are not Proofs which equal those of the Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy already mentioned, and consequently that there was a great deal of Rashness in the matter of Fact related by the Controvertists. The Author qualifies their Dispute far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; for, he thinks nothing can be more villanous than to accuse so many Princes and Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> of having annull'd the Mass, and reform'd Religion upon a Platform taken from the Devil, not by disguised Suggestions, but by Instructions formally acknowledged to be Diabolical; he maintains, that this is a great Injury, the Infamy whereof, reflects upon his Imperial Majesty, and all those Catholick Princes, who own the Protestants to be Members of the holy Roman Empire, and who have promis'd by solemn Treaties of Peace, wherein the King of <hi>France</hi> interven'd, to give them Toleration of their Religion, and even to maintain it against all those, who should give them any disturbance.— He adds, that there would have been an apparent Nullity in all this, if the Protestants were such as Mr. <hi>de Cordemoy</hi> has represented them, since 'tis certain, that every Man who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses himself to be brought up by the Devil, ought to be incapable of enjoying the Priviledges of humane Society, and deserves the Punishment of Sorcerers and Magicians. He desires to know, if those, who are now employ'd to make Converts in <hi>France,</hi> do not fancy to themselves something like this, and he wonders, that they do not imitate <hi>Francis of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> who, as 'tis said first began to instruct the <hi>Hugenots</hi> by Exorcisms.</p>
                        <p>But let us end this Article by that Remark, which we made, speaking of a Writing of the Abbot of <hi>Cordemoy,</hi> in the Novels of <hi>August</hi> 1685. We said that the Devil prefers Truth before a Lie, when he thinks it most proper to excite the Passions, and to be the cause of much Mischief. This is a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51279:23"/>
Principle which methinks cannot be contested in this, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Dispute, but to the end to perswade the World that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have follow'd the Devil's Instructions as such, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than as a Truth. But let them say what they will, this Principle is agreed upon, and we have given a notable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it, in the second Edition of this place of our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, 'tis of the founder of the Jesuits, of whom they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, that the Devil would have diverted him from his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in giving to him a most lively knowledg of the Mysteries of Religion: That which follows will serve as a Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this.</p>
                        <p>Father <hi>Bouhours</hi> admirably well describes this Diabolical Stratagem in that place, where he shews us St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Grammar at the 33<hi>d</hi> Year of his Age.—He says that the Enemy of Men's Salvation, who foresaw to what end St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Learning would tend, made use of a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Artifice to overthrow his Studies, and so carri'd this new Scholar without any intermission to the Exercises of Piety, fill'd him full of Consolations, and suggested to him such tender Sentiments for God, that all the time that he should have devoted to his Study, was spent in devout breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; instead of conjugating the Verb <hi>Amo,</hi> he exerted the Acts of Love—<hi>I love you my God,</hi> said he, <hi>and you love me: to love to be beloved,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi> more. When he was in School, his Mind was in Heaven, and whilst his Master was explaining to him the Rules of Grammar, he heard an inward Master that cleared to him all the difficulties of Scripture and Mysteries of Faith.</p>
                        <p>The Life of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> attributed to St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> gives an account of many Temptations of this kind, wherein the Devil made use of the appearances of Truth and Piety.— 'Tis then a matter confess'd on both sides, that the Devil sometimes maintains a good cause, therefore 'tis no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the goodness of private Masses, to say, that he has strongly opposed them.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s Objection against the Rule of <hi>Faith shown to be weak,</hi> and unconvincing.</head>
            <p>I Purpose (if God permit) as soon as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Solemnities of Christ's Nativity are (for this Year) past, to publish a distinct Treatise about the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> Something I have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Tract</hi> entituled, <hi>A Discourse of a Guide in matters of Faith,</hi> but that seems a little too Scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal for ordinary Readers. I intend a shorter and plainer Book for more common use. In that I shall deliver the Reason of the Case, without further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Mr. <hi>Pulton,</hi> or any other Disputer, than as the Rule shows it self, and that which is crooked.</p>
            <p>At present I shall offer that which may refute Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s Reasonings, which, howsoever, they sounded, when they were heard from his Pulpit, are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51279:24"/>
now, that they come to be seen and felt, no such formidable things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If I had wholly <hi>refus'd to return an Answer to his Question about the Bible,</hi> I had not departed from Reason. When two <hi>Iews</hi> dispute, they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about the Truth of the Writings of <hi>Moses.</hi> When two <hi>Mahometans</hi> dispute, neither of them do call in question the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> And when two Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Dispute, he that questions the Bible does un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily contend about that which he allows.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If I had persisted in the <hi>Suggestion</hi> concerning such Discourses, as <hi>tending to Atheism,</hi> or rather Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; No Man who is tender of the moments of Religion would have blam'd me, considering some of the Company that was about us. By such Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons such Converts are made, as Father <hi>Simon</hi> has made by his <hi>Critical History</hi> of the Old Testament, S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule is little observed by the <hi>Controvertists</hi> of this World: <q>Him that is weak in the Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but not to doubtful Disputations.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If I had answer'd his <hi>Questions with Questions,</hi> the way had been justifiable before all equal Judges. I mean (among others) such Questions as these, about the Copy to which the Romanists are tied in all Disputes, by the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi> Why do you make a Translation your Rule, and not the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? Why do you not follow the ancient <hi>Italic</hi> Translation us'd in the Latin Church? Why is St. <hi>Hierom</hi> for one Translation, and your Popes for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? What Latin Translation was the Church tied to in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s time, when there were numberless Translations? and why did the Church suffer them if one was their Rule? Why did the Popes <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> and <hi>Clement the 8th</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> differ from one another
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51279:24"/>
in many places, besides those which might be Errors of the Press? Why did not St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great go by this Rule? Why did Cardinal <hi>Zimenes, Pagnin,</hi> and <hi>Mariana,</hi> correct it? Why did Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> help himself in the Translation by a Jew? Why do's the very Learned French Bishop <hi>Huetius</hi> here and there touch it over again? Why do's Father <hi>Simon</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Sim. Hist. Crit. p. 313.</note> himself, who differs so much from it, tell us, that it serves as a Rule? And if it be, what Rule is it to the People who understand no Latin? And what Translation of it have they by their Church into the Vulgar Tongue? Last of all, (to refresh his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third);<note place="margin">Inno. 3. op. fol. 105.</note> Why did not HE go by the Rule of the Vulgar, if in his Time it was a Rule? He varies from it often, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Text of the <hi>Penetential Psalms,</hi> where he thus pleasantly begins his <hi>Elucidation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This Psalm, according to the Translation which the Roman Church holds, contains <hi>nine Verses,</hi> by which the Penitent gradually ascends to the nine Orders of Angels, because there is greater joy among the Angels of God over one Sinner that repenteth, than over 99 just Persons, who need not Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, although the number of ten Verses, which according to another Translation it is known to have, agrees well to reason; because Man who fell by Sin, rises by Repentance, that by him the <hi>Tenth Order</hi> may be restored. Deservedly also this <hi>Psalm</hi> has <hi>Three Ternaries,</hi> because Repentance ought to have Three Parts, <hi>Confession</hi> by the Mouth, <hi>Contrition</hi> in the Heart, and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> by the Work.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now here's your <hi>Pope</hi> for observing a <hi>Rule,</hi> and giving an infallible Interpretation.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:51279:25"/>4. The Universal Testimony which I mentioned as separate from Authority, and proving the Books of Scripture to be such Writings as they are taken to be, depends upon a <hi>firm Principle</hi> which Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> has not shaken; to wit, that so many Persons of such different Places, and Conditions, and Interests, and Perswasions; could not possibly be Confederates in a false Testimony in this Matter;<note place="margin">

Father <hi>Nicole</hi> would have yielded what Father <hi>Pulton</hi> would not; for thus he speaks <note n="(a)" place="margin">De l'unitie de l'Eglise, p. 183.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer</hi> 1. This is not true in History: for <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> mention Hereticks who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd the Scriptures, and were (as the latter calls them) <hi>Fleers from the Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This Argument proves nothing because it proves too much: for it is an Argument against
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51279:26"/>
all Rules. Hereticks have appeal'd to REASON, therefore <hi>Reason</hi> is no Rule. Hereticks have appeal'd to the dictate of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, therefore that is not a <hi>true Spirit. Hereticks</hi> have pleaded <hi>Tradition,</hi> therefore <hi>Tradition</hi> is not to be pleaded. Heathens have pleaded <hi>universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> [<hi>All</hi> Asia <hi>and all the World worship'd</hi> Diana] therefore universal Consent is not to be regarded. Contentious Men in Civil Kingdoms plead <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Presidents,</hi> and <hi>Maxims of Law,</hi> and <hi>Statutes,</hi> therefore none of these are <hi>Rules</hi> in <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Many have appeal'd to <hi>Popes</hi> in Uncanonical Causes, therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> is no Judg. The later <hi>Arians</hi> pleaded the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Sirmium</hi> and <hi>Rimini,</hi> therefore <hi>Councils</hi> are not to be pleaded. <hi>Miracles</hi> have been pretended to from the beginning by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors as signs of Truth, therefore true Miracles are no Proofs. False Appeals to a true Judg or Rule do not argue against the Truth of Judges and Rules, but against the confident and restless Contentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Appellants.</p>
            <p>Further, if <hi>Hereticks</hi> from the beginning appeal'd to the Scriptures as their Rule, so did single <hi>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERS</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> of them too: Therefore Mr. <hi>P.</hi> concludes equally against the <hi>written Word of God,</hi> as an insufficient Rule, from <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> as from <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And thus with great discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he has shut out the Witnesses whom he accepts of, that he may exclude those, to whom he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give admission. In sum, the Church may be <hi>one,</hi> the Society may be <hi>one,</hi> and the Rule <hi>one,</hi> and very sufficient, tho ill Men will either pretend

to it, or reject it. Many false Christs have risen up, yet one only is true, and he did many real Signs, and those who saw them would not yet believe in him.</p>
            <p>All this Objection is a transferring the fault from the Men and fixing it upon the faultless Rule.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> All Churches rightly constituted have living <hi>Iudges,</hi> and such as are as <hi>infallible,</hi> as the Judg or Judges in the Roman Church. That is, having a true and plain Rule in Necessaries, it is their own wilful failure, if they pronounce in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Doctrine, or Rule of Life, a false Sentence. But still Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s difficulty remains; for <hi>Hereticks</hi> will no more regard the Judg than the Rule, and they will no otherwise have a regard in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the living Judg, than as they believe he goes by the dead Rule. And that which keeps the Peace in Churches and States is such Authority, to which their <hi>Fears</hi> submit, when their <hi>Reason</hi> or Interest do not. Therefore where <hi>Infallibility</hi> is pretended, where Men are at the feet of the seven Hills, whence the Fountain of it is said to spring, it is by thousands no further regarded, than as it has Power to enforce it. And the Keys of the Inquisition keep such more quiet in that Inclosure, than those of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> For the rest, <hi>some know better,</hi> and fear by their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in necessary things, to open a gate to Atheism
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51279:27"/>
and utter Disorder, and so groan secretly under a Burden which they openly profess to have no weight: And <hi>others,</hi> born in that Communion, being set by their Teachers against Examination as private Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and damnable doubting, and a way to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Uncertainty, remain with the multitude in that way, of which they have not yet asked the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether it be the old and the good one, or not.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> P'<hi>s Rem.</hi> p. 16, 17.</note> that he either has suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient helps, or that he has us'd them, and be left after this, to <hi>his own Conscience,</hi> may not this Man's Conscience be erroneous, and actually err in things necessary to Salvation? If so, then his Religion may be Fancy, and not Divine Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Here again our <hi>Iesuit</hi> has taken up a two-edged Weapon. For his living Judg is but still a ministerial help [not (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) that <hi>we are masters of your Faith, but helpers of your Ioy</hi>]. For such a Man, before he accepts him for a Judg, must be convinc'd that he ought to accept him. And what if he be a Man of <hi>Pisa</hi> or <hi>Basel,</hi> and will bring him to the Canons of the ancient Church? And what if he be a Man of weak Capacity, and cannot understand the Arguments for such a Judg? What if he be a learned Man, and understands the Arguments better than the Imposer? and what if he has a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Mind which cannot be satisfied, not for want of outward Means, but through inward Distraction and Anxiety? Why then such <hi>a one must be left to his Conscience,</hi> whatsoever it be, in the Roman Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51279:27"/>
as well as the Reform'd. If that Church can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him, so can ours. If it has cause to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate him, we have that Spiritual Power also, but would not exercise it where there is demonstration that Men are sincere in their Perswasion and have taken due Pains, and are, in their dissentings, modest and peaceable.</p>
            <p>If they are violent by blind Zeal, or by Faction cover'd under the venerable Name of Conscience, then, when the Common-Wealth is Christian, the Civil Powers in their way, preserve the Peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>In <hi>fine,</hi> when we speak of very scrupulous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perswadable Men, what effect can <hi>Infallibility</hi> have upon them? For if they cannot be convinc'd that they have taken sufficient pains, and that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, under which they are, is sufficient; how will they be convinc'd merely by hearing it said to them, they must not dispute, they must submit to an Infallible living Judg? For that is the great Thing which so many Thousands scruple even among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. That was an Expedient among the <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreans,</hi> who were to be in Quietude and Silence, and submit in all things to, THE MASTER SAID IT. Yet they divided into many Sects, as is evident in the History of the <hi>Italic Philosophy.</hi> To say, there is a certain Guide, and on him you must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend wholly for your way, is to spend Breath and Confidence in vain, till the Wanderer knows who this Guide is, and whether he may absolutely depend upon him. If he still questions him, he must take his own way; and if he takes <hi>him,</hi> 'tis still in effect
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51279:28"/>
his own way, for he takes him upon this last Act of his own Judgment, that he is an Infallible Guide.</p>
            <p>But what if his Conscience prove Erroneous, and his Faith be Fancy?</p>
            <p>I Answer, <hi>First,</hi> as above, he has as good security in this Church, as in any other, for he has as suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means, and better than in some.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Man of good Capacity using these Means in Christian manner, if nothing distracts his Judgment, and disables his Capacity, shall not be brought to such Scruples as shall end in Fancy instead of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If he has natural <hi>Incapacity,</hi> God will not judg him for a Talent he had not. Such a Man even under the Gospel, may be as much without that <hi>Law,</hi> as the Heathens were without the Law of the Jews. For an Ideot, or a Man under a distraction, is without that as a Rule, which he is not capable of using or apprehending.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If a Man has <hi>Capacity,</hi> without Probity of Mind, and pretends Scruples, he ought not to abuse the <hi>Good Word,</hi> Conscience. He should say it is his Lust, or his Appetite, or his Fear, or his Profit, or his Vanity. And to such a one, all Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, who give best Revenues and most Ease to Flesh and Blood, are sufficiently infallible. They give him security of Pleasure and Profit, and that is as much Assurance as he asks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:51279:28"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If a Man has had a good Capacity, and an honest Mind, but is shatter'd into variety of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thoughts, by bodily Distemper, by suddain wordly Losses, by Terrors from the Anathema's of the Bold and Uncharitable, by being call'd to by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral at the same time, with great and restless Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, saying, This is the Way, the right Hand is the Way, the left Hand is the Way; I say, if such a Man, by such Disturbance, by repeated dinns of Clamour, and by such other Mechanick Influences, has the Frame of his Head so open'd, as to let in a Scruple which cannot be remov'd, or an Error which cannot be resisted; let not Man judg such a one, his Case must be reserv'd to God.</p>
            <p>This is the safety of Men, and the true Bottom on which they may be easy in all Times of Controversy, and in all Places and Circumstances, <hi>viz.</hi> That they, doing their present best, with a good Heart, both for Judgment and Manners, and repenting sincerely of the Omission or Abuse of former.

This Church subsisted many Years without a compiled Canon, for several Years past, without any written Gospels or Epistles, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulg'd or compil'd into a Canon: Wherefore the written Word of God can't be the only true Rule of Faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer. Part</hi> of this Objection is <hi>false History,</hi> and <hi>part</hi> of it is <hi>fallacious Reasoning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Part</hi> of this Argument is <hi>false History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> The first Christians were not without the Old Testament, which is the same Rule with the New, though the New is clearer: And that Rule was illuminated by the very coming of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s <hi>Gospel</hi> was written and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, and accepted within very few Years after Christ's Ascension, and so was St. <hi>Paul's first Epistle</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:51279:29"/>
to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi>; and the whole of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament was written during part of the Life of a Man; for St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> a Disciple of Christ, was the last Writer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Part</hi> of this Argument is <hi>fallacious Reasoning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, <hi>first</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The New Testament was a Rule to the Christians before it was <hi>compiled</hi> into a Canon: for by <hi>compil'd,</hi> he means compil'd into a Codex, or Volume of Canons by a Council: for Canons, Laws, and Statutes, are Rules before they are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected into a Body; and we see the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cited as the Rule, by St. <hi>Ignatius, Clement, Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and other Ancient Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Council met to compile them. And the Jews had the Law for their Rule, before <hi>Esdras</hi> (as they say) put the Holy Writers together.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Writing</hi> or not <hi>writing</hi> does not alter the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Rule which is the same spoken or written. But a Rule, which may be preserved without writing for a few Years, and whilst the Apostles were alive and to be consulted, and Evangelists commission'd by them, (who wrought amongst them real Miracles, whilst they taught the Christian Doctrine, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Old Testament, and after the manner of Christ opened the Understanding of the People, that they might understand the mystical Sense of the Old Covenant) was not likely to be preserved so entirely and so usefully, without writing, to the end of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51279:30"/>
World: Nor was the Law trusted without writing. When therefore, we say that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are our Rule, what else do we mean, but that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Messiah</hi> first taught by him, and afterwards written down by Evangelists and Apostles for the sake of Posterity, (to whom nothing could have been accurately transmitted for so long a time from Mouth to Mouth) that this Doctrine <hi>first preached,</hi> and <hi>then writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> is the Rule of his Disciples. It is a Fallacy then to say, that a Rule once not written and afterwards written, is not the same, because one is not written and the other is. And it is so weak a one, that no Man of Judgment will be insnar'd by it. For he knows in his own little Affairs that <hi>an Account</hi> made first by word of Mouth, and afterward written down for the avoiding of Mistakes, and for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of that which frail Memory would lose, is but the <hi>same Account.</hi> So our Rule which was <hi>first dictated</hi> and <hi>then written,</hi> is but one Rule. When our Saviour said it, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> repeated it, and St. <hi>Luke</hi> wrote it down, that <hi>it was more blessed to give than to receive,</hi> the Rule was not altered but preserved: And our Saviour said many other things which, because they were not written down, are not known.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>Reasoning</hi> is not right upon <hi>two Accounts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Rule of the Scripture is not like a Mechanick Rule, of which just so much serves for measuring. For the Scripture is both a <hi>sufficient</hi> and an <hi>abundant</hi> Rule. And, strictly speaking, our Rule of Faith is rather <hi>in the Scripture,</hi> than the entire Volume. For the necessary Doctrines are few, and they are often repeated: and the same things are said more than once, by <hi>Moses,</hi> by the Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists, and <hi>Apostles:</hi> There is good use to be made of all the Books extant, but if some of them had been wanting, the Rule of Faith might still have been contained in the rest.</p>
            <p>If therefore we lay aside some Books he calls Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, it does not thence follow that the Rule of Faith is shortned, because the <hi>Code</hi> of the Canon is less. All things in Scripture are useful, but all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51279:31"/>
things are not Doctrines absolutely necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whilst he argues for a Rule larger than the Primitive Church received, and adheres to a later Canon, he argues against Tradition. For he takes up that which is later, and prefers it before that which was earlier in the Church. Whereas Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion descends, but does not ascend. Now Learned Men of his own Communion allow that the ancient Church did not receive his Additional Canon any more than the Reformed will allow his Additional Creed. When both are reduc'd to the ancient Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, the Church of God will enjoy a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure both of Truth and Peace. I will lay before the <hi>Iesuit</hi> the Judgment of a <hi>Sorbonist,</hi> who has read as many Ecclesiastical Books, and made <hi>as great Collections as he pretends to</hi>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> P'<hi>s Rem.</hi> p. 18, 19.</note> in which (if you give credit to a Man that witnesses for himself, that he <hi>has read all Ecclesiastical History</hi>) the Books we call Apocryphal, were found to be of <hi>equal</hi> Authority with the rest, and consequently received into the Canon.</p>
            <p>Here I intreat the Reader to make with me these Observations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> notes on his Margin <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> P'<hi>s Rem.</hi> p. 18.</note> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that it was <hi>only a National Council of no general Obligation</hi>; but he points not at his Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> (which was later, and but a <hi>Provincial Council</hi>) with any such marginal Finger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas he says <note n="(c)" place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> that the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> was confirm'd in the sixth Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the Year 680. he forbears to add,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51279:33"/>
that there was no Enumeration of Books in that Council, and that the National Council of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi> was there <hi>confirmed</hi> as well as the Provincial Council of <hi>Carthage:</hi> And he observes not that the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was confirm'd by the great Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> not so the Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi> This sure was done to show his Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He observes not that the Council of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi> was taken into the <hi>Code</hi> of the Universal Church, but not the Council of <hi>Carthage.</hi> The first <hi>Collection</hi> of that <hi>Code</hi> ends with the second General Council, the first of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> It is true that <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> ended about 16 Years before the Synod of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but the Collection was not made so soon, tho before the Year 431. Nor is the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> added to that Code in the Collection made afterwards. It is true, it is in the <hi>African Addition</hi> in <hi>Dionysus Exiguus,</hi> but in the more ancient one it is not to be found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He omits the Note <note n="(a)" place="margin">Concil. Tom. secund. Conc. Carth g. 3. <hi>p</hi> 1177. Quidam vetustus Codex sic habet. De confirmando isto Canone Transmarina Ecclesia consulatur.</note> in the Collection of his dear Friends <hi>Labb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and <hi>Cossart,</hi> put under this 37<hi>th</hi> Canon of <hi>Carthage</hi> about the Scriptures, <q>[A certain Ancient Code has it thus Touching the confirming that Canon Let the Transmarine Churches be consulted.]</q> There was no full Satisfaction among them in these Additional Books; and for satisfaction they did not refer meerly to the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:51279:33"/>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> This Canon could not be a Canon of the <hi>third Council of</hi> Carthage, held (as Mr. <hi>P.</hi> says) in the year 397. for Relation is had in it to <hi>Boniface,</hi> who began his <hi>Pontificate</hi> about the year 419.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly,</hi> It is not true, that this Council found these Books to be of <hi>equal Authority</hi> with the rest.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Learned and impartial <hi>Romans</hi> do not say what Mr. <hi>P.</hi> does; and the Presumption of the Fathers of <hi>Trent,</hi> in setting them upon the <hi>same Level,</hi> is very heinous, as well as very new. <hi>Cardinal Cajetan</hi> was much of another mind, but neither is he Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s Pope.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The former Books of the Old Testament (for about that Canon is the Contest) were own'd by Christ himself and St. <hi>Paul</hi>; But these were not, could not be so: And the Canon of the <hi>Israelites</hi> (in <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>) is ours.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> call'd these Books Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical upon no other account than as Books allow'd to be read in Churches. This is clear'd by <note n="(a)" place="margin">A Patribus ista accepimus in Ecclesia le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda.</note> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of that supposed Canon; for there the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would have it known to <hi>Boniface</hi> and other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, in order to the confirming of this Canon, that they had received these Books to be read in the Church; and then they give leave also, that the <hi>Passions</hi> of <hi>Martyrs</hi> may be there read too upon their <hi>Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> It is true that St. <hi>Austin</hi> (his next best Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) was a Consenter in general to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>; and by that which he teaches about the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Books,</hi> we shall understand them not to have been esteemed of <hi>equal Authority</hi> with the former Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51279:34"/>
so that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> by producing St. <hi>Austin,</hi> has brought us a Key to the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> for the shutting out of himself.</p>
            <p>Let us hear St. <hi>Austin</hi> in <hi>the very place</hi> cited by Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and afterwards in other places, in which his mind is not ambiguously delivered.</p>
            <p>The place cited by Mr. <hi>P.</hi> is in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Book <hi>De Doctrina Christiana,</hi> in which Book that Father as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts a Mystical sense in the Sixth Chapter of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> (and in the very next <note n="(a)" place="margin">S. <hi>Aug.</hi> de Doct. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiana, c 9.</note> Chapter to that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Mr. <hi>P.</hi>) the <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> and <hi>Perspicuity of the Scriptures.</hi> If his Authority be valid for the Canon, Why is it not for these latter Points? But how very wide is Mr. <hi>P.</hi> of St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s sense in this very place about the Canonical Books? St. <hi>Austin</hi> affirms they are not all of <hi>equal Authority,</hi> and Mr. <hi>P.</hi> affirms they are. St. <hi>Austin</hi> before the Enumeration of them, lays down these Rules of Caution:<q> A man must hold this measure in the Canonical Books; he is to prefer those Scriptures which are received of all Catholick Churches [where note, he speaks of more Catholick Churches than one; that is, by Catholick he means Apostolick and Orthodox] before those which some, do not receive, and in those which are not received of <hi>all,</hi> let him prefer those which the greater number, and the more considerable Churches receive, before those which the Churches which are fewer and of lesser Authority receive. But if he shall find some to be received by the greater number of Churches, and others by the more considerable, (tho' this will scarce be found) yet my opinion is, that such are to be esteem'd of equal Authority.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are many other places in S. <hi>Austin,</hi> which make his mind very plain to those who are not <hi>so</hi> blind that they will not see.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:51279:34"/>Two places may at present suffice.</p>
            <p>The first is,</p>
            <p>In his Book of the City of God <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>August.</hi> de Civitate Dei. l. 18. Cap. 36. Tom. 6. p. 1096. Ab hoc tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore apud Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeos restituto Templo, non Regessed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes fuerunt usq<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ad Aristobulum; quorum supputatio temporum, non in scripturis sanctis, quae Canonicae appellantur: sed in alils invenitur, in quibus sunt &amp; Macchabaeorum Libri; Quos non Judaei sed Ecclesia pro Canonicis habet, propter quorundam Martyrum pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones vehementes, atque Mirabiles: Qui antequam Christus venisset in Carnem, usque ad mortem pro Dei lege certaverunt, &amp; mala gravissima, atque horribilia per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulerunt.</note>. There he speaks of other Books which are not Canonical, and amongst them reckons those of the <hi>Macchabees</hi> which were not in the Canon of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> received as canonical by the Church by reason of the Suffering <hi>certain Martyrs</hi>; by which passage it appears, that the Church read them not as a primary Canon of Faith, but a secondary Canon of Manners.</p>
            <p>The next place is in his second Book against the Epistle of <hi>Gaudentius</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">S. <hi>Aug.</hi> l. 2. contr. Ep. Gaud. c. 23. p. 353—hanc quidem scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam, quae appellatur <hi>Macchabaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Judaei si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut legem, Prophetas &amp; Psalmos, quibus Dominus Testimonium perhibet, tanquam Testibus suis—Sed recepta est ab Ecclesia, non inutiliter si sobrie legatur vel audiatur, maxime propter illos <hi>Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeos,</hi> qui pro Dei lege sicut veri Martyres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> in which he asserteth that the Writings of the <hi>Macchabees</hi> were not received by the <hi>Iews</hi> as they received the Law, the Prophets, the Psalms, for which our Lord bears Testimony as his Witnesses; but that it is received by the Church, and not <hi>unprofitably</hi> if it be soberly read or heard, especially by reason of the <hi>Macchabean</hi> Martyrs. As to the <hi>rest of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi> they are a further Testimony of the choice he made in his <hi>great Collection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his <hi>Epistle of Innnocent,</hi> it was shuffled at last into the <hi>Roman Code,</hi> which was very long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>Nor was the <hi>Decree of Gelasius</hi> known to the World,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51279:35"/>
till some Hundreds of years after his death; and then it came forth out of the Dark Ware-house of <hi>Isidore Mercator.</hi> Nor does it speak of the <hi>Order of the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Books,</hi> but of <hi>the Books of the Old Testament</hi>; and it makes mention but of one Book of the <hi>Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further,</hi> to what purpose is it, after so great a gap in time as is betwixt these Authorities, to mention the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> not held till the Year 1438. in which there was <hi>no Decree</hi> at all about the <hi>Apocryphal Books,</hi> tho' he asserts the contrary, from the <hi>no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of those who deceived the modern Epitomizer <hi>Caranza.</hi> What Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> might do, is in this Cause insignificant. As to that whole Council, the <hi>Greeks</hi> at their return, and when they were at Liberty, undid that which, out of fear and hope of Succour, they seem'd to agree to whilst they were in the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of the Papacy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Touching his <hi>particular Points,</hi> seeing he only mentions them, and asks Questions about them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further Discourse upon them; I will return him here a very brief answer, reserving the further conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them, for the forementioned Tract.</p>
            <p>First, For the <hi>Lords-day</hi>; seeing a time is to be set apart for the Worship of God, and that the <hi>Israelites</hi> by God's appointment, kept one Day in Seven Sacred; and that tho' the Law <hi>written in Tables of Stone,</hi> so far as it was Typical and Mosaic, <hi>was done away</hi>; and that Christ came to perfect, and not destroy the Law; and that Christ rose on that day; and that <hi>on that day at Pentecost his Church properly began</hi>; and that this day was generally observed by Christians, not meerly by <hi>Romans</hi>; there is so strong a Scriptural Reason for the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51279:35"/>
observation of it, that no Church-Authority can omit or alter it without doing that which is irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and unbecoming a Christian Society: And if the <hi>Roman</hi> should make this Attempt, it ought not to be obey'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the <hi>Feast of Easter,</hi> and the time of its observation, I do not know who they are among Christians, who make it <hi>one of the Necessaries to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> There is reason for making a solemn Memorial of Christ's Resurrection; but that the Apostles setled the time, is contrary to the express words in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle (not of <hi>Philippus,</hi> as the Editor mistakes, but <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi>) in the Council of <hi>Caesarea.</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Post Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrectionem vel Ascensio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Domini Salvatoris, Apostoli quomodo Pascha deberent observare, nihil ordinare potuerunt: Quia dispersi per universum mundum ad praedicandum fuerunt occupati.</note> Which Epistle, tho it is not so very ancient, yet it is set out as such by the Jesuit <hi>Bucherius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Concerning Baptism</hi> (Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s third Point) he says 'tis necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>If he had said <hi>generally necessary,</hi> our Catechism had thus far agreed with him. And St. <hi>Austin</hi> fetches his proofs for Infant-Baptism out of the Scripture against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> as our <hi>Church-Office does.</hi> And they who consider, that Infants are capable of ent'ring into Covenant with God, and that Christ hath mentioned no other Gate of admittance into his Church, but Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, will fear the omission of Baptizing Infants. And he who has regard to the Analogy of both Covenants, will as readily construe our. Saviour, as requiring the Baptizing of Infants in that command, Go and bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Christian School <hi>All Nations,</hi> as a <hi>Iew</hi> would have construed <hi>Moses,</hi> as requiring the Circumcising of Infants, if he had said, Go and Circumcise all Nations.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:51279:36"/>4. For the Doctrine of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> opposed it by Tradition, and the Fathers prov'd it by Scripture. And the place in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Epistle, <hi>There are three that bear Record in Heaven,</hi> was by the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> believed to be of such force against them, that they removed it out of many Copies.</p>
            <p>Instances are infinite: I will produce but one out of St. <hi>Hilary</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">

            <p>THREE things on this subject Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> asserts; yet there is not one of them which he can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>

               <hi>that Popery flourished in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> near a <hi>Thousand years</hi> (he might as well have added my number of Ten thousand) before <hi>Protestancy was ever heard of</hi>; and that we our selves confess it.

against the Popes Jurisdiction above a Thousand years ago; that we had <hi>Witnesses</hi> against <hi>Romish</hi> Errors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther</hi> rose: That our Faith is the Faith in the Ancient Creeds; and that if our Protestations against <hi>Romish</hi> Errors are new, it is because <hi>they</hi> were new, and that we could not sweep out the Dirt, till they had brought it in; and that we are the same Church as from the beginning, the Corruptions only being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He <hi>avers</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">M. <hi>P</hi>'s Rem. p. 26.</note> that the Corruptions I mention are but <hi>supposed,</hi> and that I shall never be able to shew that St. <hi>Gregories Faith was not that which</hi> Rome <hi>now teaches.</hi>

                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mr. P's Rem. p. 2.</note>. He accuseth me for want of Respect, in charging the Religion of which the sworn Head of his own Church is a Principal Member, (which as themselves [the Protestants] confess) flourished in this Kingdom near a Thousand Years before <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy</hi> was ever heard of) to be such, <hi>whence a moping, lying, and uneasie temper,</hi> naturally flows. All this I believe he might write himself; it is original.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>want of respect,</hi> (or rather the humblest duty, where it is so just a tribute), I shall never fail to pay it. And here in this instance, the fault with which he tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, he himself committeth. He <hi>wears</hi> the Sacred name of a King, by using it upon every unnecessary occasion. Whereas they who understand the profound civil veneration which Crowned Heads may challenge, are at the same time frugal in the mentioning of their Names, and free and abounding in their Allegiance. Add to this, that they less honour a Prince than they ought, who create any uneasiness to his Subjects, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51279:40"/>
that is an uneasiness which is not pleasing, when in common conversation men are under Terror; when they have a suspicion, that their words shall be watcht, and each innocent phrase, which the Hearer likes not, shall be called a Reflection upon the King.</p>
               <p>But (to come to the strength of his Accusation) what a false and invidious consequence is here? <hi>I. S.</hi> grew worse upon Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s tampering with him, and so it appear'd to D. <hi>H.</hi> and Mr. <hi>V.</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; therefore the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> is such whence a <hi>Mopish, lying and uneasie temper</hi> NATURALLY flows. I suppose this consequence was not drawn by him by the <hi>Art of Thinking,</hi> which the ingenious <hi>Iansenists</hi> have published. Must that be <hi>Natural</hi> to a Religion which may be the effect of dissettlement, and the fault of the method of the <hi>Tamperer</hi>? There are many made worse by Empyrical practicers, though the Physick it self might not <hi>Naturally</hi> do it. Mr. <hi>P.</hi> talkt so much of <hi>Luther</hi> and the DEVIL, and of DAMNATION <hi>out of his Church,</hi> that <hi>I. S.</hi> might for some time, be under an affrightment. If I may say it in his own light way, he ought to have forborn his stories of <hi>Goblins,</hi> when he was putting his Child to rest in his Mothers bosom.</p>
               <p>From his Premises then, the Conclusion is not my want of duty, if he draws it, not with Jesuitical, but Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Art. I wish him a greater share of Loyal duty himself.</p>
               <p>He will (he says) REFER himself to the JUDG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT OF HIS MAJESTY, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mr. P's <hi>Rem.</hi> p. 31.</note> which seems a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity bordering on irreverence.

She was a Person I never (to my knowledg) saw before or since, much less in a Church, or at a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She own'd (to the best of my remembrance) that <hi>her Brother was a Priest</hi>; She had the very <hi>Shib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boleth</hi> of the Party. Perhaps she was not formally reconcil'd, for I perceive a great many are some years contracted, e're the Priest joins their hands; but they live all the while very lovingly together. I told her of my Suspicion, that some <hi>Priest</hi> or other, had sent her of an Errand, and at that saying, she seem'd out of Countenance: So little Reason had I for the incivility of saying She was <hi>Impudent.</hi> But however, if <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Lamb</hi> was there in her Magical <hi>Mantle,</hi> she may (I doubt not) prove it upon me. I do not affect the finesses of Courtship; but for IMPUDENCE it is a word I do seldom use to those who deserve it.

It is much that I had nothing to say upon this Argument, when Mr. <hi>Meredith</hi> may remember that upon the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection as made by him, I gave him this answer, to which he has not yet repli'd, That our Church was no more Fallible than any other in the World; That God's Providence would not suffer all to fail together; That we had a certain Rule and Sufficient means; That we were as infallibly sure of the Necessaries of Faith, as a man is of casting up a Sum right; tho', by misattention, 'twas possible to commit a mistake: And that our Church could prove it had rightly computed. This was said to him at the side of the Bed in the second Room about the Close of our Talk.</p>

                     <hi>You talk,</hi> said he, <hi>of Miracles in the</hi> Romish <hi>Church, I'le show in one Example, what Credit they are of; There was upon a time a certain Priest, who got money by exposing the head of a pretended Saint to the peoples charitable Veneration: Now as Providence would have it, a Chirurgion, on what suspicion I know not, pierced this Saintly Head with his Launce, and found it to be a piece of Parchment; now, said he, tell me of</hi> Roman <hi>Miracles again.</hi> This was certainly the happiest stroke of a Launce we shall ever find mentioned in History; if his Hand was not that of a Lady, his Eyes, at least, those of an Eagle, and his Heart of a Lyon. I wonder this Chirurgion is not Canonized by the pretended Reformers, for thus totally routing the <hi>Romish</hi> Church: What need then of tumbling <hi>over Concordances,</hi> and beating mens Brains to search out misapplied Texts of Scripture, and bring them in by the Head and Shoulders against <hi>Popery</hi>; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance whereof we have in that <hi>Learned Catechism</hi> lately cry'd about the Streets; and to give it the greater Credit, father'd on our Doctor, when this one story of the Chirurgion, with the help of Doctor <hi>T</hi>'s Application, would every whit as well do the feat, and be as much to the purpose: As you may see by this <hi>Specimen.</hi> Master. <hi>Were there ever any Miracles wrought in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church these Twelve hundred years?</hi> Scholar. <hi>No, for there was a Chirurgion,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <q>—These Gentlemen are—so imprudent, as to bring to light such scandalous Histories as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice Hereticks. For example, can any thing be more terrible than what they have caused to be printed against Indulgences and Relicks, with that <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the XI. which condemns some supposed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks without design of injuring those that are real? Amongst others this is one of the Stories they have published; in the year 1668, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the VII. sent into <hi>France</hi> three Chests of Relicks, to be put into the Hospital Church; these Three Chests were bound up with Red silk Cords, and sealed with the Seal of Cardinal <hi>Ginetti,</hi> Commissary for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and with the Seal of the Popes <hi>Sacristain.</hi> These Relicks were accompanied with a Bull, which said, they might with all surety be exposed to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the people; they had already caused Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Bills to be fixed in every Quarter of the City,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51279:43"/>

The Bishops of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> and <hi>Cahors,</hi> Father <hi>Don Cosme,</hi> Father <hi>Crasset,</hi> and the Abbot <hi>Fromentieres,</hi> were to Preach during the <hi>Octave.</hi> It was however order'd, they should be search'd.

               <p>For once, however, I will decline his advice, and the rather because he does not use it himself. And I will tell him a Tale out of a Jesuit's School, and it shall be about his beloved Article of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>

                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> the fam'd Cardinal and Learned Jesuit, wrote a <hi>Catechism</hi> for Youth. He pretends in it to lay the Grounds of Religion.

the <hi>Catechism</hi> of the Church of <hi>England, with Scripture Proofs. Scripture Proofs</hi> are good Grounds, whomsoever they offend, but they will not always serve the Jesuits turn.

(as his word was to me, as often as I had answered, and he began to reply); the plain truth is this; he named St. <hi>Cyril</hi>'s <hi>Catechism</hi> for the proof of <hi>his Corporal Presence</hi>; I did prevent his repeating the words, by saying that I knew them, and that they needed no Answer from me, being answered already at the end of a certain <hi>Printed Conference</hi>; to which he replied, that there was a <hi>Printed Answer</hi> to that Account of the <hi>Conference</hi> betwixt Mr. <hi>S. &amp;c.</hi> and that he would shew it me; now that <hi>Famous Answer</hi> I could never yet hear of,<note place="margin">See here ch. 1.</note> any more than I could hear of the <hi>Famous Paper</hi> Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> promised to print last Monday Seven-night for the clearing the Certificate of <hi>Katherine in the Clouds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but the Answer was <hi>borrow'd</hi> from <hi>E. S.</hi> just as a man borrows, when he promises you a Citation out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and truly cites his words. But when I have occasion to borrow, I should as soon borrow of the Reverend <hi>E. S.</hi> as of any man; for he has a mighty Stock of good Learning, and he is very Communicative. I would not so soon go to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> notwithstanding he has read <note n="(a)" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s Full Account, noted in D. T's p. 81.</note>

For as the Bread of the Eucharist after Invocation of the Holy Ghost, is no longer common Bread, but the Body of Christ; so this Holy Ointment is no longer meer or common Ointment, after Consecration, but the Gift of Christ, and by the Presence of the Holy Ghost hath a Divine Efficacy.</hi>

And that which he saith oftenest and plainest, ought to be taken for his true meaning.</p>
                     <p>The same thing he saith, concerning the Water in Baptism in his other Catechetical Discourses: <hi>Come not to Baptism as to common Water, but as to the Spiritual Grace which is given with it;</hi>

                     <p>Here is such a similitude of Expressions as may make it most reasonable for us to assert that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood them in the same manner.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I answer, That he saith, It is not meer Water, and that is as much as he means as to the Bread in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist.

this to be done, as the body of Christ was produced in the Womb of the Virgin, by the Power of the Holy Ghost; and yet Christ had true Human Nature in him, being born of the Virgin, as well as conceived by the Holy Ghost. So here, the true Substance of the Bread might remain, yet by the Operative Power of the Holy Ghost, that Bread might become the Body of Christ; not by being changed into the substance of that Body which was born of the blessed Virgin, but by an immediate presence of the Spirit of Christ in it.

                     <p>But the <hi>Greek Fathers</hi> were men of finer thoughts, than to entertain so gross a notion as that of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>; which was first started by a Western Monk of no great capacity, and was opposed by the men of Wit and Learning at that time. One who had been much in the East, and suckt in the opinions of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was the most earnest opposer of it. But Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Superstition prevailing in the Western Church, it came by degrees to be owned and received by it; especially after the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> concerned themselves in the quarrel against <hi>Berengarius.</hi> From that time the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> and <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> have been so closely united, that they cannot part with this (though like an <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> it lyes so heavy upon it) without giving up the other. But as long as Learning and Liberty continued in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, they were utter strangers to it, (what Barbarism and a very prevailing Argument among the Modern <hi>Greeks,</hi> may have done as to the receiving <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> I am not much concerned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.) But as to the Learned <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, as far as I can find, they knew nothing at all of it. They had a notion among them, of a real Body of Christ in the Sacrament after Consecration; but they still supposed the substance of the Elements to remain, as fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by that very Discourse M. <hi>P.</hi> nibbles at; but it will break his Teeth to answer it.</p>

                     <p>In the time of <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie <hi>de Auxiliis</hi> was carried so high between the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> that the Pope himself resolved to have the hearing of it. And the Generals of both Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were to chuse their Divines, and to be present with them. <hi>Greg. de Valentia</hi> was of one side, and Father <hi>Lemos</hi> of the other. The Controversie came to a passage of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> which <hi>Greg. de Valentia</hi> alledged; the other answer'd, it was not so in his Book, and desired to see that which <hi>Greg. de Valentia</hi> used; he was very unwilling, but the Pope comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him; <hi>F.

                     <p>YOU were pleased to insist again in your last, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my not standing to my agreement; I must mind you again, that your own conscience is witness all our discourse of WRIGHTING, was in reference to the quotation of St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and farther carrying on the matter in debate and that no body mentioned a title of giving or not giving an account of the pure matter of fact past. However, take it as you please, I never gave a Copy otherwise then to be WRITE out (and that with express order of distributing no copies) nor shall you ever produce the man that had one from me, or by my order, knowlege, or consent, till I had sent you your's, and this I can prove, and if you charge me with the contrary, it shall be incumbent on you to make it out. I return you many thanks for your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging profer of sending me the first sheet, I desire you will not give your self that trouble, it will suffice that you send me a Copy of the whole, the evening before you publish it (if such be your resolutions) and I will do the same. For your remarks upon the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which I here send you at large, I leave it to you to send them or not, and I will proceed therin as you shall prescribe, if you send me yours, Ile send you mine, but I must acknowlege having no Secretary or Servant it is

very troublesome and expensive to me, but I am willing to shew herein, that I am desirous to prove my self.</p>

               <p>I am personally accused of bitterness, tho no man was yet the worse for me, for <hi>meer Religion,</hi> one hair of his head: I am also involv'd in the common Cause of the Reformed, as a <hi>bloody</hi> man; and you must not doubt of this, for Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s CATHERINA IN NU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BIBUS, can plainly prove it by this Certificate; <q>I do testifie, That D. <hi>T.</hi> is a Sanguinary Man, for he is by Church-Principle, against RESISTING the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> and approves not of the EXCLUDING and DEPOSING Doctrines taught in Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s great <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Council, before there were <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and also after

            <head>CHAP. VIII. Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> considered in his Triumphs.</head>
            <p>HIS Triumphs are made up of Two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. His performances in the Conference.</item>
               <item>2. The wonderful Success that followed it.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. He <hi>perform'd mightily</hi> in the <hi>Conference</hi>; and as if he had had a double Portion of the spirit of every one of his <hi>Six Vncles who were Iesuits</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mr. P's Rem. Ep. Ded.</note>. I will give you a true Representation of his way of <hi>performing</hi> in the <hi>Conference</hi>; and I submit it to you, whether he who has perform'd so <hi>little</hi> as he has done in <hi>Two printed Books</hi> upon <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,</hi> could perform so much as his <hi>Party</hi> has boasted of together with <hi>himself, in his talk at adventure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>way</hi> of <hi>performing,</hi> consisted in repeating the Names of some of the Fathers, and some <hi>Questions</hi> over and over, without condescending either to <hi>accept</hi> the <hi>Answer,</hi> or to <hi>enervate</hi> it. What is the Rule of Faith? How do you prove the Bible? From what Copies had you it? What Copies? What Copies? When? How? Where? St. <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> St. <hi>Irenoeus,</hi> &amp;c. St. <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> St. <hi>Irenoeus,</hi> &amp;c. And when
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51279:54"/>
I was desiring to speak to St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> which he first alledged, he was still at his <hi>Cries,</hi> St. <hi>I. Martyr,</hi> St. <hi>Irenoeus, &amp;c.</hi> He was at more than his <hi>Once, Twice, Thrice,</hi> at his <hi>Auction of Strong Reasons.</hi> In good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, this is no Mockery; it can be attested by the Oaths of many Judicious and Serious People present; this is as true as it would be pleasant, if the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence had not been about <hi>Religion.</hi> And thus because he would <hi>ask on,</hi> and throw the same Stone again into the Well after it had been taken out and laid before him, he calls this VICTORY; but by his leave, a Grammarian who gives <hi>words their freedom,</hi> and sets them at liberty from their signification, recedes from his Art. They were used to these <hi>Victories</hi> beyond the Alps, whilst the <hi>Iesuits</hi> preached the <hi>Mountebanks</hi> down from their own Stages. I believe such a man as the Excellent Bishop <hi>Saanderson</hi> would have been silenced by this way: And his Reputation would have suffer'd through his modesty; but I who had less <hi>Learning and more confidence</hi> than he, did set my Face against <hi>his Face,</hi> as well as my Reason, and what he calls my Rule, against his <hi>shews</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I must confess an Infirmity, and own to my Reader, that he still stands in my Fancy, in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Man of <hi>Huffing Valour,</hi> who asks for his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, tho' he is in readiness; and threatens to draw, and immediately to slay him; and still he does nothing, tho' there is no Lock upon his sheath. He goes away and triumphs, and at last shows his Sword to the World, and it appears to be a weapon <hi>of Lath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> as he triumphs in his performance in the Conference, so he glories still more in the <hi>success</hi> that attended it <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mr. P's Rem. p. 33. Singular Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of D. <hi>T</hi>'s <hi>Conference.</hi>
               </note>. He will tell you it himself; for he has the Art of putting the Laurel on his own Head. He

glories not indeed in Mrs. <hi>R.</hi> in Mr. <hi>V.</hi> or Mrs. <hi>V.</hi> who were all come over in the Taverns and Coffee-houses, but confirm'd at home. But let that pass; he has other <hi>Triumphs</hi> which will render him, a Man of Fame to Posterity. <hi>There are</hi>

S.</hi> is in <hi>facto esse</hi>; Why! here's the success of the D. of <hi>Lorain</hi> and <hi>Morosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</hi> Nay further, the Report of that <hi>Catholick Ladies Leaving the Roman Faith, is false</hi>; we have it upon his Certificate in the Margin: [but what if more than Two are coming from his Church, and from under his very Wings, tho' they are not Ladies?] And that the <hi>Tyber</hi> loses more ground on the one side, than it gains on the other. If <hi>he</hi> had had a FAIR CONFERENCE, he que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions not but he should have been yet more successful; if he might have read on in his <hi>Specutum and Breviary,</hi> and been suffer'd to set time back some hundreds of years, and brought <hi>Paschasius</hi> acquainted with <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, no doubt he had been the <hi>Xaverius</hi> of the <hi>Savoy.</hi> But as it was, he carry'd off young <hi>I.S.</hi> and Ten days after <hi>I.S.</hi> was <hi>reconciled.</hi> I had thought they were very good friends before; but the <hi>Mayor</hi> is no <hi>Mayor</hi> till the <hi>Show</hi> be over.</p>
            <p>I pity any that are seduced, from the bottom of my Heart; but if any shall go away upon noisy Talk, and such Motives as Mr. <hi>P.</hi> has yet given either in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, or Catechizing, or Printed Books (in which the World may see his strength) they are either very weak in Capacity, or strong in their inclinations to wander.</p>
            <p>Now, seeing he has writ what he would have said about <hi>his main point,</hi> and no body has given him inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and some-body (they say) has given him help; we shall surely, ere long, have his Two turn'd to Fifty; for his REMARKS must certainly carry all before him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:51279:55"/>And now methinks I see him in the figure into which <hi>Valerian</hi> the famous <hi>Capuchin</hi> once condescended to put himself. <q>Has it not been told you? have you not read (says the humble <hi>Valerian</hi>) <note n="(a)" place="margin">Val.
