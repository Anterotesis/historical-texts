            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <head>To <hi>E. C.</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> my sonne by the University.</head>
                     <lg>
                        <l>WHen first my minde call'd it self in to think,</l>
                        <l>There fell a strife not easie for to end;</l>
                        <l>Which name should first crown the white papers brink,</l>
                        <l>An awing father, or an equall friend:</l>
                        <l>Fortune gives choice of either to my minde;</l>
                        <l>Both bonds to tie the soul, it never move;</l>
                        <l>That of commanding, this of easie love.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>The lines of love, which from a fathers heart</l>
                        <l>Are draw'n down to the sonne; and from the sonne</l>
                        <l>Ascend to th'father, draw'n from every part,</l>
                        <l>Each other cut, and from the first transition</l>
                        <l>Still further wander with more wide partition:</l>
                        <l>But friends, like parallels, runne a level race,</l>
                        <l>In just proportion, and most even space.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Then since a double choice, double affection</l>
                        <l>Hath plac't it self in my twice-loving breast;</l>
                        <l>No title then can adde to this perfection,</l>
                        <l>Nor better that, which is alreadie best:</l>
                        <l>So naming one, I must implie the rest;</l>
                        <l>The same a father, and a friend; or rather,</l>
                        <l>Both one; a father-friend, and a friend-father.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>No marvel then the difference of the place</l>
                        <l>Makes in my minde at all no difference:</l>
                        <l>For love is not produc'd or penn'd in space,</l>
                        <l>Having i'th' soul his onely residence.</l>
                        <l>Love's fire is thought; and thought is never thence,</l>
                        <l>Where it feels want: then where a love is deare,</l>
                        <l>The minde in farthest distance is most neare.</l>

                     <lg>
                        <l>And now but late I sang the <hi>Hymen</hi> toyes</l>

                        <l>What other dare not wish, was full in either.</l>

                     <lg>
                        <l>Too true you said, that poet I was never,</l>
                        <l>And I confesse it (fair) if that content ye,</l>
                        <l>That then I playd the poet lesse then ever;</l>

                        <l>But I the truth, truth (ah!) too certain sent ye:</l>

                        <l>To pluck such apples (lost with self same price)</l>

                     <l>Joyn'd side to side to heare his art:</l>
                     <l>Hares ran with the dogs along,</l>
                     <l>Not from dogs, but to his song.</l>
                     <l>But when all his verses turning</l>
                     <l>Onely fann'd his poore hearts burning,</l>
                     <l>And his grief came but the faster,</l>
                     <l>(His verse all easing, but his master)</l>
                     <l>Of the higher powers complaining,</l>
                     <l>Down he went to hell disdaining:</l>
                     <l>There his silver lute-strings hitting,</l>
                     <l>And his potent verses fitting,</l>
                     <l>All the sweets that e're he took</l>

                     <l>Does the lords of ghosts deceive.</l>
                     <l>The dog, whose never quiet yell</l>
                     <l>Affrights sad souls in night that dwell,</l>
                     <l>Pricks up now his thrice two eares;</l>
                     <l>To howl, or bark, or whine he fears:</l>
                     <l>Struck with dumbe wonder at those songs,</l>
                     <l>He wisht more eares, and fewer tongues.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Charon</hi> amaz'd his oare foreslowes,</l>

                     <l>Who to laws can lovers draw?</l>
                     <l>Love in love is onely law:</l>
                     <l>Now almost he left the night,</l>
                     <l>When he first turn'd back his sight;</l>

                     <l>His Love he saw, and lost, and dy'd.</l>
                     <l>So, who strives out of the night</l>
                     <l>To bring his soul to joy in light,</l>
