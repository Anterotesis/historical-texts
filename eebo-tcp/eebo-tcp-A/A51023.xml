            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>BY vertue of an Evangelical Precept, it is an incumbent Duty on every <hi>Convert</hi> to endeavour the ſtrengthening of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Faith of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to <hi>Reduce</hi> all thoſe that by any indirect Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or for want of regular Inſtructions have wandered out of the ſtrait ways of Peace, Truth and Holineſs, into the crooked Mazes of Sin, Schiſm and Hereſie, to the hazard of their eternal Intereſts. How much I have concerned my ſelf in the Diſcharge of this Duty, is legible to all that have either had the Juſtice or Curioſity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves about it; for as ſoon as it pleaſed God to open the Eyes of my Underſtanding, and ſhew me the Error of my own ways, I induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſet my ſelf upon the good Work of Reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, and have cauſe to bleſs his holy Name, that I have not altogether laboured in vain, but have been an Inſtrument in the Hand of God, to convince ſome of the neceſſity they were under of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93927:3"/>
In this attempt it is notoriouſly known alſo, what Injuries, Contempts, Slanders, and ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Uſages I have encountred both beyond Sea and in <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Quakers,</hi> with whom I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſively aſſociated above Thirty Years: And that for no other Reaſon, but that I endeavoured by all the fair, candid, and honeſt ways imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to convince them that they lived in many <hi>groſs Errors</hi> and <hi>Hereſies</hi>; and that they ought to make ſome compenſation for the Evils and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors they were guilty of, by a ſpeedy return <hi>to the Truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> and by an unfeigned Repentance for all the Evils they had been guilty of, in ſeducing ſo many well-meaning Souls into Principles and Practices, that border upon Death and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>It would be altogether needleſs in this Diſcourſe to enumerate the ſeveral ſteps I made in order to the Conviction and Converſion of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and to ſhew all the Arts their <hi>Chiefs</hi> employ'd to fruſtrate my good Intentions, and to keep up their own Reputations with their Party, ſince I have already publiſhed the whole Proceedings <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93927:3"/>The firſt quarrel that of late they ſeemed to have againſt me, was, that in expoſing their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in publick <hi>Audiences,</hi> and in my Printed Narratives I had dealt unjuſtly; and this falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port they have been exceedingly induſtrious to divulge, not only to poſſeſs them of their own Way, but any others they could influence into an ill Opinion of me, for falſly quoting their Authors; and thereupon, without any kind of Proof, call me <hi>Lyar, Falſe and Treacherous Man, Deceitful and Malicious,</hi> all which Names return upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſince I have printed a Certificate in my third <hi>Narrative,</hi> under the Hands of ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and judicious Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whom I procured to hear and examine all my <hi>Quotations,</hi> that fully vindicates my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in that particular: which being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, I have reaſon to expect a more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Cenſure in relation to their other Calumny, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the ground of my Conteſts with the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> was out of meer <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from their ill treatment of me, and not out of Zeal and Love to the Truth of Chriſtianity; whereas nothing could be ſuggeſted more Falſe and Scandalous; for the only motive that I had to oppoſe the ſpreading <hi>Gangrene</hi> of their <hi>vile Errors,</hi> which have already leavened many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in theſe Nations, and if not prevented will corrupt many more, was purely out of <hi>Zeal for the Cauſe of God and his true Religion,</hi> and not out of any <hi>private Pique</hi> I had with any of them; of which, as I have given no Evidence, ſo my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bears witneſs to my Innocency. Seeing then my <hi>Charges</hi> are juſt againſt them, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all my Narratives; and their <hi>Clamours</hi> and <hi>Accuſations</hi> againſt me are wholly falſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, the Crime will be laid at their own Door in calling <hi>Names,</hi> and I ſhall bear their Revilings with greater Patience, ſince 'tis univerſally
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93927:4"/>
known, that this is the way they commonly treat all Perſons how <hi>Innocent</hi> and well-deſerving ſo ever, that touch them in the tender part, and oppoſe their <hi>Errors</hi>; ſo that the Proverb may be fitly applied to them, <hi>That their Tongue is no Slander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the great Argument that they make of my <hi>Inſincerity,</hi> is, my having been formerly ſo long among them, and yet never till of late pretended to know that they held ſuch <hi>groſs Errors</hi> as I now accuſe them of. That I have been a <hi>Quaker</hi> long, I acknowledge, and am of Opinion, that none are ſorry that I was ſo once, but they that are angry that I did not continue ſo always, let them make what <hi>Reflexions</hi> they pleaſe upon my <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> and want of <hi>Conſideration,</hi> in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among a Society of People, whoſe Principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was ſo much a ſtranger to. I confeſs my <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and am <hi>aſhamed</hi> to think that I have been ſo long <hi>deceived</hi> by them; but yet this is no impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Sincerity, unleſs knowing them Guilty, I had <hi>connived</hi> at it, <hi>flattered</hi> them in it, or <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fended</hi> their Errors contrary to my <hi>Conviction</hi>; or againſt the Light of my own <hi>Conſcience</hi> had encouraged them to Perſeverance. But in this I am no way culpable; for though I know ſome of them were <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſound,</hi> I did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble with them, or cloak the matter; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions check'd and reprov'd them, as will ere long be ſhewn in ſeveral Inſtances. Yet I was wholly unſenſible that either <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, William Penn,</hi> and many other of their chief<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt Teachers had been guilty of theſe Errors, having read but few of their Books, and them but ſlightly too; and when I found any thing that I diſliked, a <hi>blind Affection</hi> ſwayed me to an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Judgment, and I imputed leſſer Faults rather to their <hi>Inadvertency</hi> than their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Judgment, until they ſided with my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and then it grew to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93927:4"/>
Rupture, and I withſtood them to their Faces.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Objection</hi> that they raiſe againſt me, is That the things which I now call <hi>Vile Errors,</hi> and <hi>Hereſies</hi> in them, I had formerly Defended, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that in ſo doing I had a <hi>Divine Senſe and Acceptance</hi>; to which I anſwer, Firſt, by utterly denying that ever I defended them in thoſe <hi>Vile Errors</hi> which oppoſe the <hi>four great Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> which I have ſince charged them with, or, indeed, any other Article of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> properly ſo called, or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. Thoſe things wherein I defended them, were only ſtating the Matter fairly, between them and their <hi>Opponents</hi> in ſeveral Caſes, wherein I thought them unduly charged; partly in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Uſe and Application of places of Scripture, to prove certain Truths, and partly in too much <hi>aggravating</hi> and <hi>widening</hi> through my too great <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>prepoſterous Zeal,</hi> and being too <hi>Biggotly</hi> affected, though ignorantly to that Party who call all others <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and themſelves the <hi>Church,</hi> yet are certainly more Biggoted into a <hi>Sect,</hi> and more implicitely led by <hi>Sect-Maſters,</hi> than any People in Chriſtendom that I know of. And laſtly, I have acknowledged, and lamented my <hi>Sinful Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Raſhneſs,</hi> in my former op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing any <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> or reflecting in my Books upon any particular <hi>Perſons,</hi> or <hi>Religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</hi> And to argue a little with my Adverſaries, who object, That I have formerly defended the <hi>Quakers Principles,</hi> I would fain know <hi>what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they mean</hi>? Whether they relate to the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi> of Religion; if ſo, let them name them, that I may give the World Satisfaction by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my Fault, or juſtifie my ſelf where I am falſly accuſed.</p>
            <p>And if through Humane Infirmity, Weakneſs, or Ignorance, (for <hi>humanum eſt Errari, Labi, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi</hi>) I have miſunderſtood any thing, which by a more diligent Examination and Application to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93927:5"/>
the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> I have diſcoverd afterwards to be a miſapprehenſion; this will be no proof of my Inſincerity, or that I am <hi>an Apoſtate, gone from all Divine Senſe and Tenderneſs, loſt my good Condition, without any inward Feeling</hi>; for theſe are the lovely Epithets they beſtow upon me.</p>
            <p>But are not theſe <hi>Qaakers</hi> uncharitable Men? Can a miſtake in ſome things render a Man Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally miſtaken in all things? Becauſe ſome are beguiled with <hi>Shews</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is there therefore no ſuch thing as true and ſound <hi>Reaſon</hi> in the World? Becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> once thought he ought to do many things againſt the Name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> muſt his <hi>Converſion,</hi> be call'd an Argument of his <hi>Inſincerity?</hi> Muſt he be thought an unſound <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe he was once a <hi>Jew,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a Perſecutor, and a <hi>Blind leader of the Blind,</hi> for fear of being call'd an Apoſtate from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which he imbibed in the days of <hi>Ignorance</hi>? Away with theſe ridiculous Notions, which are but the <hi>Evaſions, Quiblings,</hi> and <hi>Shiftings</hi> of the Party, which by muddying the Water, hope to eſcape undetected. Why will they not be try'd by their own Rule, and allow that <hi>Liberty</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they exerciſe among themſelves? Have not ſome of the moſt <hi>Eminent</hi> among them been egregiouſly deceived, and taken their <hi>Fanciful</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations for <hi>Divine Lights</hi>? Their Conſciences will tell them, what particular Perſons of great Note among them I could name, that have been ſcandalouſly miſtaken by their own Confeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and took things upon Truſt for <hi>Divine Breathings,</hi> that upon better Examination proved to be <hi>Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movs Deluſions.</hi>

            <p>Did not ſome of the moſt celebrated <hi>Quakers,</hi> nay, even their <hi>Preachers,</hi> follow the <hi>Blaſphemous, Enthuſiaſtick Deluſions</hi> and <hi>Waking Dreams</hi> of <hi>James Naylor,</hi> and <hi>John Perrot?</hi> Was it not one of their great Preachers, <hi>Samuel Cater</hi> by Name, now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that lead <hi>James Naylor</hi>'s Horſe by the Bridle,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93927:5"/>
when he Rid Triumphantly into <hi>Briſtol.</hi> Was that a <hi>Divine Senſe</hi> in <hi>George Fox,</hi> who ſaid his Marriage with <hi>Widow Fell,</hi> was a Figure of the Church coming out of the Wilderneſs, and that the Figure might be compleat, thoſe that credited that Deceit, concluded her to be with Child, though ſhe was paſt Sixty Years of Age, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accounted it Miraculous. Other conſiderable Inſtances might be given of their extravagantly Wild, and Frenetick Deluſions, than I thank God can be charg'd upon me; for, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Miſtakes and Errors I lay under, yet as to the main, I bleſs God, I was preſerved. But what a ſad and ſcandalous Inference does this way of Arguing caſt upon themſelves, who generally in their <hi>Books,</hi> Father all their <hi>Vileſt Errors</hi> and <hi>Hereſies</hi> upon the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> according to the Notion they have of the Spirit dwelling in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which means they <hi>Hedge</hi> up their way, and <hi>Baricado</hi> up themſelves againſt all diſcoveries and acknowledgments of their Errors; becauſe they think they are guided by the Spirit; and are ſure they poſſeſs the <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe they think ſo, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe by their own arguing they muſt be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. When a Man turns from <hi>Error</hi> to <hi>Truth,</hi> muſt he be call'd an Apoſtate? When a Man through humane Infirmity, ſlides into <hi>Miſtaken</hi> Notions, without denying or oppoſing any Article of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> can this be call'd Apoſtacy? Surely, in the Judgment of any ſober and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Party it cannot; and therefore their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring me, is unchriſtian as well as uncharitable, ſince I have only renounced the <hi>Errors,</hi> I was tainted with <hi>whilſt I lived and convers'd among them</hi>; as for their <hi>Heriſies</hi> I was never, I bleſs God, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with them.</p>
            <p>As Idle, Impertinent, and Vain, is their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that 'twas very unlikely, that living thirty years among them, I could be Ignorant of their <hi>Principles:</hi> Which is a Fallacy in Terms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93927:6"/>
are <hi>a Body of People,</hi> how could I, or any Body elſe, know their <hi>Principles,</hi> when 'tis known to all the World they have none, and are profeſs'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to <hi>All Creeds,</hi> and <hi>Confeſſions of Faith</hi> owned by all their Members, without which 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (without a Miracle) to know what their Principles are; for to this day never any <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith</hi> has been univerſally received by them; but ſome are of one Opinion, ſome of others, and what is affirm'd to Day for Truth, is denied to Morrow: A <hi>Weather-Cock</hi> is not more variable in its Motion, than the <hi>Quakers</hi> are dexterous in ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Opinions, through all the parts of the Compaſs. They are now more enraged againſt me than ever, and call me <hi>the Epitome and very common place of all their Preceding Adverſaries,</hi> with other vile and abuſive Names, which is but acting like themſelves, and ſpewing out the <hi>Venom</hi> of their Hearts againſt me; from the Infection of which I pray God preſerve me and all Chriſtian People; and that if it pleaſe God, he may give them a Senſe of their great Sin of uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards me, and true Repentance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of it, who hate me, and count me their Enemy, for endeavouring to do them good, and ſeeking ſincerely to reduce them from their Errors to the Truth; the Succeſs of which my ſincere Labour, I commit to Almighty God, with whom I leave my Righteous Cauſe, and in whoſe Mercy I truſt through Jeſus Chriſt, that he will preſerve me in Soul and Body, from being a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to their Fury and Rage.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93927:6"/>
many undeniable Proofs can be given to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as particularly their Antichriſtian Errors publiſh'd in their Books, wherein they Lye for Conſcience ſake, and Entitle their Errors and Blaſphemies to the holy Spirit of God.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93927:7"/>
is moſt certain, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> refuſing to meet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſpute with me in Defence of their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at <hi>Turner's-Hall,</hi> has been a great Means to let many of thoſe formerly in Unity with them, ſee their <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> and the badneſs of their Cauſe; and will yet be a further Means to give many others the like Diſcovery, who are <hi>diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> with their not appearing, either to vindicate their <hi>Books,</hi> and <hi>Authors,</hi> or to acknowledge the great <hi>Errors</hi> contained in them, and to <hi>Retract</hi> them. They are, indeed, brought to a very <hi>Pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dilemma</hi>; for if they dare not appear to anſwer the change of <hi>Error, Hereſie,</hi> and even <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> that is brought againſt them, but invent frivolous Diſcourſes to excuſe themſelves, the People will ſoon perceive their Cauſe is bad, that ſtands in need of ſuch weak Props to ſupport it. One Pretence for their non-appearance was, That they might not offend that <hi>Authority</hi> that had indulged them with Liberty of Conſcience, and in the mean time make little other uſe of it, than to <hi>Rail</hi> againſt that <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> whereof the <hi>King</hi> himſelf, and the beſt of his Subjects are <hi>Members,</hi> and to call me and my Friends for owning that Church, and coming into Communion with it, and Relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing the <hi>Errors</hi> condemned by it, <hi>Apostates,</hi> and <hi>Runagado's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his Inſinuating, that 'tis Envy increaſing in me, that has led me into a diſturbance of Mind, which in its Courſe reſembles the returns of a delirious Affliction, and that has caus'd me to give them ſo much Diſquiet; I think it not worth an Anſwer, and therefore ſhall leave it as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their <hi>Scornful, Proud,</hi> and <hi>Haughty,</hi> as well <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchristian</hi> Tempers.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93927:8"/>
ſhall be able to ſtop my Progreſs in this Duty, <hi>to contend earnestly for the Faith of Christ which was once delivered to the Saints,</hi> and which the <hi>Quakers</hi> labour to Deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Having thus anſwered their <hi>Objections</hi>; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now by Impoſition of Holy Hands, <hi>Ordain'd a Minister of the Church of</hi> England, that I may not be thought to deſert the <hi>Quakers</hi> out of any Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Diſguſt, or for Worldly Intereſt; but purely out of the Diſſatisfaction of my Conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they had forſaken God, and Renounced the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christian Religion</hi>: And that I durſt not on the Peril of my Eternal Salvation, aſſociate lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with them, leſt being tainted with their <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,</hi> I ſhould be obnoxious to their <hi>Puniſhment</hi>: I ſhall in the next place give you ſome of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that engaged me to Abandon <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> and to embrace <hi>Christianity,</hi> according to the <hi>Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church, of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>And the firſt Reaſon I aſſign for leaving <hi>Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm,</hi> is becauſe they are at ſuch great <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainties</hi> in what they profeſs, that no Man can have any aſſurance where to bottom, or whether that which they own to day, will be allow'd to be Truth to Morrow. They are conſtant in nothing but in Contradiction, and 'tis Reaſon enough for them to Disbelieve any Poſition, and with all their Force and Powers to oppoſe it, if it had not the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onour of their Invention, and became Current by the Stamp of their own Authority; and if it were not for their Habits, they would be all taken for <hi>Mahometans,</hi> by refuſing to believe, or act like Chriſtians. All other Religious Societies have their Confeſſions of Faith, under ſome Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other, by which Men may know what they believe; but the <hi>Quakers</hi> are ſuch Lattitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians, that if a Stranger ſhould ask what they were, he could receive no other Anſwer, than <hi>that they are what other Men are not</hi>; but ſuch as in <hi>Humour, Geſture, Garb, Mein<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Nonſence, are <hi>Antipodes</hi> to all the World; of which nothing is a greater inſtance, than car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying dead Men to their Graves with their <hi>Heads</hi> foremoſt: And if enquiry ſhould be made what Faith they profeſs, it muſt be anſwered, that no Body knows, nor themſelves neither; and their Meeting-Houſes might be Dedicated <hi>to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond Reaſon is, That if their Principles may be collected out of the Books they publiſh, they are too <hi>Erroneous, Heretical</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> for any good Chriſtian to comply with; ſome of which I ſhall recite in this Diſcourſe, and refer you in the <hi>Margin</hi> to ſuch Places in my <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> where the Quotations are proved beyond contradiction. Now the firſt thing I ſhall charge the Quakers with, is, <hi>That the Scriptures,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dictate of their greateſt Teachers, <hi>are not the Word of God.</hi> This Notion is ſo common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all their <hi>Authors,</hi> and ſo frequent in the Mouths of their <hi>Proſelites,</hi> that it is almoſt loſt labour to prove it upon them. One of their famed Authors is ſo angry with his Opponent, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming <hi>that the Scriptures are the Word of God,</hi> that he charges him with Blaſphemy <note n="*" place="margin">Nar. 4 p. 22.</note> for Aſſerting it, and by conſequence makes the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and all other Proteſtant Churches to be guilty of that direful Imputation. Nor is this Doctrine of theirs a ſtrife about Words; but the Foundation of their <hi>Deiſm,</hi> and a handle for the Overthrowing <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>; and therefore the <hi>Quakers</hi> have very lately Reprinted <hi>William Penn</hi>'s Diſcourſe concerning the General Rule of Faith and Practice, who brings Fourteen Arguments to prove that the Scriptures are not the General Rule of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi>; in Three of which Arguments he accuſes them of <hi>Imperfection, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty</hi> and <hi>Obſcurity</hi>: And this is a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Hereſie; for by this Principle they are not obliged to believe one intire Doctrine in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93927:9"/>
Creed, as indeed I could eaſily prove they do not. <hi>George Fox</hi> does not only deny the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Word of God <note n="*" place="margin">Nar. 4. p. 24.</note>, but gives them contemptible Names, as Ink and Paper, Duſt, and Serpent Meat. But that the Scriptures are <hi>the Word of God</hi> is clear from abundant of Places in the Scriptures. <hi>Our Goſpel came unto you,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians, not in Word only</hi>; by Word here is meant Doctrine. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.13. <hi>The word of the Lord was made unto them Precept upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, Line upon Line</hi>; here the Precepts and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Lines of the Prophets are called <hi>the Word of the Lord</hi>; and <hi>John</hi> 15.25. it is called the <hi>written Word,</hi> which was a ſhort Sentence written in one of the Pſalms. And when <hi>Paul</hi> bid <hi>Timothy</hi> preach the <hi>Word,</hi> it cannot be juſtly thought that he would have him only preach the Inward Word, but by the Word he meant <hi>the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi>; and all that the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay againſt this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Truth, is but mere trifling, and humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Spirit of Contradiction.</p>
            <p>The next ſtroke the Quakers make towards the Deſtruction of Chriſtianity, is, againſt the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt, and to this purpoſe <hi>William Penn</hi> in a Controverſie between himſelf and ſome <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Miniſters in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Queſtion was, whither he that ſuffered Death without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not, and is, properly the Son of God, <hi>William Penn</hi> in his Book called a <hi>Serious Apology,</hi> p. 146. ſaith, <hi>That the Outward Perſon which ſuffered was properly the Son of God, we utterly deny.</hi> With the like Confidence <hi>G.W.</hi> aſſaults the <hi>Humanity</hi> of Chriſt, in poſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>tively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that Chriſt conſiſted of Fleſh and Bones, in thoſe words: <hi>I diſtinguiſh,</hi> ſays he, <hi>between con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and having, Chriſt had Fleſh and Bones but did not conſiſt of them: as a Man has a Coat or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but does not conſiſt of it; and that outward Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſuffered at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was Chriſt by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning of the the thing containing for the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93927:9"/>
But all Sound and Orthodox Chriſtians ſay, according to the Scriptures, that Chriſt is both God and Man, having his <hi>Godhead</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> ſo united as to conſtitute <hi>one Chriſt,</hi> which is a miraculous and extraordinary <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> that no other Creatures neither Angels nor Men are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with! And though Chriſt as Man was the Son of God, miraculouſly conceived and born in time; and alſo as God, was by a Generation from all Eternity, yet he is but one Son of God, and becauſe of the perſonal Union of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with his Manhood, <hi>both as God and Man, is properly the Son of God.</hi> The Excuſe the Quakers make, that Chriſt did not meerly conſiſt of Fleſh, Blood and Bones, ſignifies nothing; for none ever affirm'd any ſuch thing: Whatſoever has Parts conſiſts of thoſe Parts, <hi>Incompleatly</hi> of one or more Parts, <hi>Compleatly</hi> of them all. The Foundation of the Quakers great Error on this Head, lieth here, That becauſe Chriſt was before the Body was, therefore that Body is no part of him, which is eaſily anſwered thus: Chriſt was before that Body was, but he was not compleatly and in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, fitted to be the Anointed Saviour of the World, until the <hi>Word was made Fleſh,</hi> that is, till the <hi>Word</hi> did take our Fleſh and whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into a perſonal Union with him, which was neceſſary to the compleat Performance of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory Offices, of King, Prieſt and Prophet, and eſpecially of his Prieſtly Office.</p>
            <p>The next thing I charge as abominable <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> eſpecially <hi>G.F.</hi> and <hi>.G .W</hi> is for affirming, <hi>That Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, and his Suffering without us in the Fleſh, and his outward Fleſh and Blood was a Figure, and but a Figure of Chriſt of what he ſuffered in us, and his Blood ſhed in us.</hi> Thus as the <hi>Quakers</hi> reaſon why they caſt off outward <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> is, becauſe the Subſtance is revealed in them, whereof they were Figures; ſo for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93927:10"/>
they think Chriſt's Death at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is not to be minded nor Preach'd, becauſe <hi>it was but a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt's Suffering in them,</hi> and therefore the uſe and remembrance of it ceaſeth; and if this is not horrid <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> certainly there is no ſuch thing in the World. This was generally their manner of <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Writing</hi> at their firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; to tell People that Chriſt was <hi>Begotten</hi> in them, <hi>Born</hi> in them, <hi>Crucified Dead</hi> and <hi>Buried, Riſen</hi> and <hi>Aſcended</hi> into Heaven <hi>within them,</hi> and that every one, in order to eternal Salvation, muſt learn to know Chriſt thus <hi>Begotten</hi> and <hi>Born</hi> in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this <hi>inward Conception</hi> and <hi>Birth</hi> of Chriſt they made the greateſt Myſtery and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, whereof Chriſt as born in the Fleſh was the <hi>Figure, and a facile Repreſentation</hi> (to uſe <hi>William Penn</hi>'s Phraſe) <hi>of what is to be tranſacted in us,</hi> and thus they repreſented the Work of <hi>Regeneration</hi> to be a greater Myſtery than <hi>God manifeſted in the Fleſh, viz.</hi> in that Body of Fleſh that was born at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> By this high ſublime Doctrine, which many admired becauſe they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, they gave forth to be given by <hi>immediate Revelation from Heaven,</hi> which was a plain Cheat and a horrid <hi>Lye,</hi> for the whole was nothing but what <hi>George Fox</hi> had gleaned from ſome old <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and <hi>Familiſts,</hi> who had it long before him. They alſo mightily magnified themſelves, and <hi>Rail'd</hi> againſt all others as Dark, Ignorant, <hi>Sots,</hi> Deceivers and Antichriſts, that would not receive this new-fangled Notion, which they learned from <hi>Ranters</hi> and <hi>Familiſts.</hi> And tho while I was with them. I was not altogether Ignorant that they uſed ſuch Phraſes of Speech; yet I thought they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it only by way of <hi>Allegory</hi> and <hi>Methaphor, as Origen, Auſtin,</hi> and other Greek and Latin Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, and which I my ſelf have partly uſed in ſome of my former Books, only by way of Allegory and Metaphor; but when after all their Shifting, Doubling and Prevaricating, I found

they intended this Doctrine ſhould be underſtood among their <hi>Proſelites,</hi> as indeed it is, according to the literal Interpretation, I did my utmoſt to oppoſe the growth of it, and drew the Envy of their <hi>Preachers</hi> upon my ſelf.</p>
            <p>And ſince I have taken the liberty to charge them with Blaſphemy upon this Head, give me leave to incert a Blaſphemous Letter in this brief Diſcourſe, for the ſatisfaction of the Readers that cannot compaſs it in a larger Volume.

               <hi>Audland</hi>'s Letter, by ſaying theſe words were not intended to <hi>George Fox,</hi> but to <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Life</hi> in <hi>George Fox,</hi> which ſome think is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter offence than the other. The like excuſe <hi>George Fox</hi> made for a Woman Quaker, that in a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Meeting call'd <hi>George Fox the Holy One of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> And the ſame Apology was made for thoſe Quakers that ſung <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to <hi>James Naylor</hi> at his Proceſſion into <hi>Briſtol.</hi> But theſe Shifts and Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings does not hinder the Practices from being abominable <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for they are the ſame excuſes that the <hi>Heathens</hi> give for Worſhipping of <hi>Idols,</hi> becauſe it was not the <hi>Idol</hi> but the <hi>Divine</hi> Power that was in it, which they Worſhipped.</p>
            <p>I charge <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and <hi>William Penn,</hi> who are two of the Leaders of the Quakers that cauſe them to Erre, with downwright Hereſie, in <hi>denying Chriſt to be God coequal with the Father</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Nar. 1. p. 14, 15, 17.</note>, and for affirming, <hi>That if Chriſt was Cocreator with the Father, then there were two Gods.</hi> Alſo for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying <hi>the Exiſtence of a Chriſt without us,</hi> after their Socratical way of Writing; in theſe words. <hi>What Scripture Proof is there that Chriſt ſubſiſteth outwardly Bodily, without us at God's Right-hand? and where is God's Right-hand, is it viſible or invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, within us or without us only? and is Chriſt a Saviour, as an outward bodily Exiſtence or Perſon without us, diſtinct from God, and on that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be worſhipped as God, Yea or Nay?</hi> This way of Talking and Writing is the peculiar knack of the Quakers, who have more <hi>Shifts</hi> and <hi>Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges</hi> to cloak their <hi>Hereſies</hi> than any of the <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> Tribe.

All their Writings are ſtuffed with ſuch inexplicable and unintelligible Phraſes, and wild Notions, that they ſeem rather intended to puzzle and diſtract than inlighten a Reader; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their fallacious Pretences of being an <hi>innocent, plain, ſimple People, that are moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Scripture Language</hi>; yet they are as far from it as Light from Darkneſs, for in truth no Society of Men that are called Chriſtians, no not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, have ſo much devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Scripture Language, and Scripture Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Sence, as the Quakers have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as the Spirit of Pride and vain Glory does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abound in worthleſs Minds, as empty Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and ſhallow Brooks are known to yield the loudeſt ſound, ſo the Quakers are always filling the World with their own Commendations, as if there were no good, wiſe, nor vertuous Men upon Earth, but what were encloſed within the narrow confines of a <hi>Quaking Conventicle,</hi> whereas in truth the readieſt way to know them rightly, is read them in the reverſe of the <hi>Characters</hi> they give themſelves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> alſo ſay, <hi>that we are not Juſtified by the Blood of Chriſt outwardly ſhed,</hi> which is a piece of Divinity more fit for <hi>Bedlam</hi> than any ſober So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of People, <note n="*" place="margin">Nar. 1. p. 33.</note> but as if this was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Stigmatize them, with the approbius Name of <hi>Obſtinate,</hi> or <hi>Blind</hi> Hereticks, they are pleas'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to add alſo, <hi>That we are not Sanctified by that Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Chriſt that was ſhed without the Gates of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>but by an inward Blood, whoſe Power and Vertue is unknown to any but the Quakers</hi>; and if theſe are not bold Strokes againſt the whole Doctrine of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and the Declarations and Confeſſions of

               <hi>That the Body that dieth never riſeth again,</hi> which is expreſly oppoſite, and contradictory, to many places of Scripture, that eſpecially in <hi>Acts</hi> the 26th, <hi>That Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and ſhould be the firſt that ſhould be raiſed from the Dead.</hi> In all parts of the World where the <hi>Quakers</hi> have ſpread themſelves, there is a Univerſal Neglect among them, of <hi>Preaching Christ Crucified, and concerning Faith in him</hi>; Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the Light <hi>within,</hi> and Chriſt <hi>within</hi>: And when I began to preach up the Fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Chriſtian Religion among them, they ſtood up againſt me, and charg'd me with preaching up new Doctrines, and one appeal'd to the Monthly Meeting, whether they ever heard of ſuch Doctrines preach'd in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, directing them <hi>to Faith in a Chriſt without them.</hi> I Reverence Divine Providence, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>Quakers</hi>; but if I had known they had had ſuch Errors among them, <hi>I would as ſoon have put my Head into the Fire, as have aſſociated with them</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>They were ſo aſſiduous in maintaining their own <hi>Erroneous</hi> Principles, that they did all they could to prevent me from oppoſing them, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that I was a <hi>Falſe Teacher,</hi> and accuſed me for ſetting up thre Heterodox Principles. <note n="*" place="margin">Nar. 1. p. 38. &amp; 39.</note> The firſt was, <hi>That Chriſt's Body roſe out of the Grave,</hi> and they affirm'd, <hi>it never did,</hi> and dared me to give an Inſtance, that one Engliſh <hi>Quaker</hi> was of my Opinion.</p>
            <p>The Second Accuſation was, <hi>that I had ſaid, That it was lawful to pray to Jeſus Christ Crucified.</hi> And in this alſo challeng'd me to name one <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker that I ever heard pray to Chriſt,</hi> and when the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. was read. <hi>To all that call upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, both their Lord and ours.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>was as Dark, and as Ignorant as</hi> George Keith <hi>is</hi>; adding, <hi>for our part we know better.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:93927:13"/>The third piece of Falſe Doctrine they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me of, was, for ſaying, <hi>That the best Saints had need to come always to God by the Mediator, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> This they inveighed againſt as a groſs Error, and ſaid, <hi>they would come to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him</hi>; this ſort of Doctrine is to be found in <hi>William Shewen</hi>'s Book, a Quaker in great eſteem among them.</p>
            <p>For theſe things they Excommunicated me firſt, and afterwards preſented me by a <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and they would have found me guilty of <hi>Death,</hi> (though I was wholy Innocent of indeavouring to change the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they accuſed me of) if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not been taken out of their Hands, and I diſcharg'd from that falſe and malicious Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Governour <hi>Fletcher.</hi>

               <note n="*" place="margin">Nar. 1. p. 38. &amp; 40.</note> by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorizing Plain and Poſitive Texts of Scripture, have endeavoured to overthrow the Belief of Chriſt's <hi>Birth,</hi> his <hi>Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion,</hi> and <hi>coming to Judgment,</hi> and by this Artifice, has left us no Scripture to prove that the Death of Chriſt was any <hi>benefit</hi> to us; and as to Chriſt's coming to Judgment, <hi>Whitehead</hi> ſays in an Anſwer to <hi>R. Gordon, that he might look till his Eyes dropt out, before he ſhould ſee, Chriſt appear again outwardly in a Bodily Exiſtence.</hi> After this having read over my Books, they drew up ten Articles againſt me, charging me with falſe Doctrine in ten Particulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>John Humphrey</hi> ſays in his firſt Letter, that he perceives by thoſe Articles, <q>That my Faith reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too much of Carnality, a carnal Body of Chriſt in Heaven, a carnal Election and Reprobation, a carnal Juſtification and Adoption, a carnal Day of
Judgment and Reſurrection beyond the Grave. I am grieved, <hi>ſays he,</hi> to hear ſome ſay, they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be juſtified by that Blood of Chriſt that was ſhed at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Is not this to be carnally Minded?</q>
               <hi>William Baily,</hi> who was a great Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93927:13"/>
among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and whoſe Books <note n="*" place="margin">Nar. 3. p. 3.4.</note> they have Re-printed, ſays, <q>
                  <hi>That</hi> the Apoſtle Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt the word nigh in the Heart, and in the Mouth, and that the Ingrafted Word, is able to ſave the Soul. He did not preach a Viſible Chriſt with Fleſh and Bones, as ſome others do. So he taught them to pray, <hi>Our Father,</hi> not to look at his Perſon, and to pray to him as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without them, but within them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Where we may obſerve, that if they were not to pray to him as a Perſon without them, by the ſame Reaſon they are not to believe in him as a Perſon without them; but Chriſt not only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as the <hi>Word,</hi> who is Omnipreſent, and in all Men and Things, but as made Fleſh, and having taken the true Nature of Man into a Perſonal U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion therewith, and repleniſhing the ſame with the fullneſs of the Godhead, and
with all fullneſs of Grace and Truth, <hi>is the Object of the Chriſtian Worſhip,</hi> together with the Father, and the holy Spirit, dwelling and reſiding in him.</p>
            <p>But of all this Antichriſtian <hi>Quaking</hi> Crew, none have diſcovered more Indignity and Hatred to the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> than <hi>William Shewen,</hi> in a Book, call'd, <hi>A ſmall Treatiſe concerning evil Thoughts,</hi> p. 37. being about to conclude a Paragraph, he ſaith, <hi>Not to Jeſus the Son of</hi> Abraham, David, <hi>and</hi> Mary, <hi>Saint, or Angel, but to God the Father, all Worſhip, Honour and Glory is to be given.</hi> A <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> would have expreſſed greater Reverence to Chriſt than this Quaker has done; but what can be expected from ſuch People as <hi>deny the Lord that bought them, and count the Blood of Jeſus as unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Mankind.</hi> And whether theſe are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reaſons for leaving People of ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, I leave the World to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Smith,</hi> a great Man among them when he was alive, in his <hi>Primmer,</hi> Printed at <hi>London,</hi> 1668, Asks this Queſtion, <hi>p.</hi> 8. <hi>Child,</hi> but how may I know which are the True, and which are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93927:14"/>
the Falſe Teachers, ſeeing Words may be the ſame? and makes Childs the <hi>Father</hi> thus inſtruct the Child:
<q>Why, they that are falſe Preach Chriſt without, and bid People believe in him as he is in Heaven above; but they that are true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they Preach Chriſt within, and direct Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to wait to feel him in themſelves; and ſo to believe in him as he makes himſelf manifeſt in them.</q>
And having given this as an infallible Sign of a Quaker, he makes the <hi>Child</hi> ask; but muſt I not try all things by the Scriptures? and the Father anſwers, <hi>Nay, for the Scriptures were given forth by the Spirit, and it is the Spirit that tries whether the things be true or falſe, good or evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is another piece of the Old Serpents Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty; for ſince the Spirit muſt try all things, they laying a claim to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> have inveſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a pretence, to make their own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of greater Authority than the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Which is another good Reaſon for leaving them that deny the Word of God to be the <hi>Teſt</hi> of Chriſtian Doctrines; and though we are commanded to <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> diſcharge us from doing it.</p>
            <p>Through the Pride of their Hearts the Quakers pretend to <hi>Infallibility, and a ſinleſs Perfection in this Life</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Nar. 4. p. 1, 2.</note>, vilifying all thoſe that deny them this Prerogative, as under the Curſe, in another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit than Chriſt, the Prophets, and Apoſtles were in, that gave forth the Scripture. And <hi>George Whitehead</hi> affirms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Thoſe that Miniſters that want In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibity have not the Spirit of Chriſt, but are out of the Truth, and their Miniſtry is deceiful.</hi> And this they as confidently and proudly affirm as the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>But it is denied by all <hi>Oxthodox Chriſtians,</hi> as repugnant to the Doctrine of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who yet grant that all the Faithful are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly led into all Truths neceſſary to Salvation,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93927:14"/>
by the infallible Spirit in the uſe of the Holy Scriptures, which contain the <hi>infallible</hi> Truths of the Goſpel. But as this Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is contradictory to Scripture, which brands all with the Infamous Character of <hi>Lyars</hi> that pretend to it, ſo it is ſeldom claim'd, but by thoſe that are fartheſt from it, as is manifeſt among the <hi>Quakers</hi>; who though they pretend to be guided by an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit,</hi> 'tis apparent that many of them are under great <hi>Deluſions</hi> and <hi>Errors</hi> concerning the great <hi>Truths</hi> of the Evangelical Diſpenſation, as has been proved by the foregoing Inſtances.</p>
            <p>Again, as to their pretence to <hi>Sinleſs perfection,</hi> he that makes a Scrutiny into their Morals, will ſcarce find them ſuch a Church as is without Spot or Wrinkle, but are as far from that Perfection which they boaſt to have attained to, as any other ſort of People that pretend to any exactitude in their Converſation; and as to their <hi>Principles</hi> 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>George Fox</hi> their Quondam Metropolitan, <hi>Edward Burroughs, Francis Hougil, Richard Hubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn,</hi> and ſome of their greateſt Saints, lived in great Ignorance, Error and Unbelief, in divers great Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Faith, and in great uncharitableneſs toward ſuch as differ'd from them. The ſame humour of Self-conceit that began with this People, ſtill continues among them, and <hi>G.W.</hi> laughs at the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways from Seven Years of Age to Seventy, <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lord have mercy upon us miſerable Sinners.</hi> Is not this a plain Evidence of the intollerable <hi>Pride</hi> that reigns among the <hi>Quakers</hi> concerning their Sinleſs perfection, who deſpiſe not only the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but all other Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches throughout the World, who pray for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sins, tho' when Chriſt taught his Diſciples to pray for their <hi>Daily-bread,</hi> he enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them alſo to pray for the Forgiveneſs of their Sins. Muſt not the Diſeaſed come to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian till they are cured, and thoſe that feel the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93927:15"/>
Burden of Sin <hi>pray to be Eas'd?</hi> How arrogantly does <hi>George Whitehead</hi> charge the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for Confeſſing and not Forſaking their Sins. How can he more prove his Charge againſt them, than againſt his own Society, or himſelf. Many in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and among other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, may compare with the beſt of <hi>Quakers</hi> for Holineſs of Life, and far exceed them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vertues, eſpecially in <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi> But pray tell me, you Self-conceited <hi>Quakers,</hi> are not they better employ'd who <hi>confeſs their Sins,</hi> and yet through humane Frailty find they Relapſe into ſome Sins than ſuch proud Phariſees as you are, that neither <hi>Confeſs nor forſake your Sins,</hi> but employ your Selves in Railing againſt them that do. They that Confeſs their Sins ſhew a Deſire, and pray for ability to forſake them, whilſt thoſe that ſay <hi>they have no Sin, deceive themſelves</hi> into ſuch a Security, as is the ready Road to Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The next great Article of Faith which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Fight againſt is, <hi>the Reſurrection of the Body</hi>; but becauſe the denying this in plain terms, they think would make them be deſpiſed, among all the various Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity, William Penn</hi> being urged to Anſwer the Proofs that were brought from the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. ſays in his <hi>Rejoinder,</hi>
               <q>That let the whole Chapter be conſidered, and we ſhall find no ſuch thing as to imply a Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reſurrection, but a change from Earthly Mindedneſs, to a renewed State to God, thro' the Operation of the Spirit.</q>
Which ſhews us how they deceive the unwary Readers; who would make them believe they own the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body</hi> according to the Scripture, and yet mean nothing thereby but <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or the New Birth in time, before the Death of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Body. And ſeeing this is the Reſurrection they own, and no other, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cited by <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>Matthew</hi> 22.30, 31, 32. <hi>in the Reſurrection they neither Marry, nor give in Marriage</hi>; might not one ask them, whether they don't commit a hainous Crime, who Marry, and continue in a Married State, after they have attained to this Reſurrection? And whether their Quondam Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Thomas Caſe,</hi> did not act more Agreeably to his Principles, who turned away his Wife after he reckon'd he was come to the <hi>Reſurrection</hi>; and whom I heard ſay, <hi>all Marriage was of the Devil</hi>; and many know that it was his Principle; but whether he did not ſupply that Defect by a more faſhionable method, <hi>Quere.</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93927:16"/>
to Judge the World in natural and paſſible Fleſh, and not only ſo, <hi>but that he would not come in the ſame ſubſtance of that Body he had on Earth, which was a mortal and paſſible Body, of the ſame Nature with ours</hi>; for he makes it moſt abſurd; that an Earthly Body, and an Heavenly Body, can be the ſame Subſtance, and ſo denies Chriſt's being now in Heaven without us, in that Body which roſe from the Grave, or his coming without us from Heaven in that Body to Judgment; for there is no place of Scripture of the many that are juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought by <hi>Orthodox</hi> Chriſtians, to prove Chriſt's coming without us, in his glorified Body to Judge the World at the great Day of Judgement; but ſome of their Teachers have turned altogether to his <hi>inward Coming,</hi> which they ſay they Witneſs already fullfilled in them, and they look for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coming.</p>
            <p>To which give me leave to add, That <hi>they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Baptiſm, and the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper</hi>; which be pleas'd to take in their own words, in a Book call'd, <hi>Some Principles of the Elect People of God, in ſcorn call'd</hi> Quakers <hi>p.</hi> 75.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Baptiſm,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that we own, is the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Chriſt with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire, but we deny all other; for there is but one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all. They that would have one Baptiſm outward and another inward, would have two Baptiſms, when the Scripture ſaith the Baptiſm is but one, and whoſoever hath the Baptiſm outward are the ſame they are before, but the Baptiſm of Chriſt makes a new Creature.</hi> — <hi>And now I ſee the other to be but a formal Imitation, the Invention of Man, and a meer Deluſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſpeaking of the Lord's Supper they ſay, <hi>It is but feeding upon the Husk and Shell which, is Carnal; for the Bread which the World breaks is Carnal and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>atural, and only feeds the outward Carnal Body,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93927:16"/>
and goeth into the Belly, and ſo paſſeth out into the Dunghill; and ſo likewiſe the Cup which they drink, and ſo the Communion and Fellowſhip of the World paſſeth away; but this is no Nouriſhment of the Soul, but ſtill the Soul lies in Death, and here is no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion but Natural, Outward and Carnal, of ſeveral Minds, and Hearts full of Filthineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which</hi> Is the Table of Devils, <hi>eating and drinking their own Damnation, not diſcerning the Lord's Body, which is Spiritual, and cannot be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Natural Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Penn</hi> in his <hi>Reaſons againſt Railing,</hi> p. 108. affirms, <hi>That Circumciſion is as much in force as Water Baptiſm, and the Paſchal Lamb as Bread and Wine, they were both Shadows, and both Elementary and Periſhable. And we can teſtifie from the ſame Spirit by which</hi> Paul renounced <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that they are to be rejected, as not now requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; neither have they ſince the falſe Church eſpouſed and exalted them, ever been taken up afreſh by God's Command, or in the leading of his eternal Spirit; and the Lord will appear to gather his People out of them, but never to eſtabliſh or keep People in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a ſad and fearful Deluſion are the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> under, who call the Inſtitutions of our Bleſſed Saviour, and which are expreſly enjoined to be continued to the end of the World, by ſuch hard Names; which is but ſpitting their <hi>Venom</hi> in the Face of the Inſtitutor. Some of the <hi>Quakers</hi> when they heard me defend the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> ſaid, <hi>George, ſince thou art for Outward Baptiſm and the Supper, why dost not practice it</hi>? To which I anſwered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had no lawful Call to Baptize others, and as to my ſelf I was ſatisfied with the Baptiſm I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in my Infancy, being born of Chriſtian Parents; for I believe that Baptiſm being a Seal of God's Covenant of Grace, does as truly belong to the Infant Children of Believers under the New Teſtament, as Circumciſion did to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93927:17"/>
Children of Believers under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Next as concerning the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> after it pleaſed God to convince me that it was and is an Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and let me ſee my Sin and Errour in rejecting it; for which I have been humbled before God, ſincerely and heartily ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him forgiveneſs, and which I hope God for his Bleſſed Son's ſake has given me: I had for a conſiderable time ſome Heſitations about the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Due <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> and being clearly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in all my Scruples in that particular, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid receiving it for the ſake of others, leſt my forwardneſs ſhould give them Offence, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I did it without ſuch a religious Conſideration and Preparation, as was requiſite before Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe Holy Myſteries. That through Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy being alſo much removed, I became uneaſie to delay that longer which I was convinced was my indiſpenſable Duty, and declared I would receive it at the firſt opportunity, and accordingly did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as has been before related: And heartily wiſh, that all others who are under the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions and Prejudices, in which I too long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, would follow my Example, and be made partakers of the ſame inward <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> which through Mercy I enjoy in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude: Another Reaſon why I deſerted the <hi>Quakers,</hi> was, becauſe I am able, through Mercy, to prove, That <hi>they do not believe One Article of the Apoſtle's Creed,</hi> in the true Senſe of Scripture, and all Orthodox Chriſtians in the whole World; and that all their <hi>Teachers</hi> pretences to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and extraordinary Prophetical <hi>Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> are all Artifice and Deluſion; which joined to the <hi>Errors, Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> already mentioned, will ſufficiently juſtifie my leaving them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93927:17"/>Now what remains in this ſhort account of my Change, is to give you the Reaſons, why among all the Pretenders to the beſt reformed Church, I have at laſt enter'd into Communion with the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in which I ſhall uſe all the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity imaginable. Now as nothing ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned me as the <hi>Salvation of my Soul,</hi> and in order to that the <hi>choice of my Religion,</hi> ſo I exerted all my <hi>Care</hi> in examining things conducing to it, that I might be able to give account to others, and have ſatisfaction in my ſelf, that my Religion was not the Effect of <hi>Chance,</hi> but eſpouſed upon a <hi>deliberate</hi> and <hi>well-adviſed Choice,</hi> which I take to be the regular Method towards a Settlement. Men may indeed be <hi>Confident,</hi> but can never be <hi>Certain</hi> without Knowledge, a diligent Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Things propoſed to their Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And this made me more in love with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that does not require a blind Obedience; but is contented her <hi>Doctrines</hi> ſhould be examined by the cleareſt Light, in which I could largely expatiate in her Commendation, and the Reproof of others that withhold the means of Inſtruction from their Members, and boaſt of an abſolute Infallibility which they have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to; but I haſten to the Reaſons that obliged me to cloſe with the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the firſt was, becauſe in Purity of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> the comes neareſt to the Pattern of <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> She retains the <hi>Three Creeds,</hi> and does not reject the firſt <hi>General Councils,</hi> and adminiſters the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> according to the Divine Preſcription. All her Children pray in a Tongue they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and only to God through Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Church preſſes Men to <hi>Piety, Loyalty, Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and earneſtly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93927:18"/>
deſires the Salvation of Mankind. She Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches up the Excellency of <hi>Good Works,</hi> but places her <hi>hope</hi> in the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God and the <hi>Mercy</hi> of his Son, and every one that lives up to the Principles of this Religion are <hi>Safe</hi> and <hi>Happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe in the main <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> the whole Church is of one mind, and have as much <hi>Unity in Faith</hi> among them, as they had in the firſt Churches planted by the Apoſtles themſelves: And their Differences are in leſſer and ſecondary things, which have no relation to the Primitive Doctrines of Chriſtian Religion: Which who ever oppoſes they diſown him, and look upon as in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt the Church; which is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by broken, nor the Unity of its Faith deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For though ſome Men have preached ſtrange Doctrines, and drawn Diſciples after them, (which is no more than they did in Apoſtles days) yet they have not prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Church, nor overturned its Faith: And if ſome looſer Part of the People have been carried away, yet the Body of the Church, like an unmovable Rock, ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in as great Unity as was antiently in any of the <hi>Apoſtolical Churches,</hi> and that is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to invite us to Conformity with it, and Perſeverance in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another Reaſon that induced me to embrace the Religion profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> was, Becauſe ſhe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93927:18"/>
the Scriptures to be <hi>the Word of God, the Rule of Faith, the Judge of Controverſies, and the Guide of Humane Life</hi>; ſo that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult our Reaſons, uſe our Eyes, and mind our Rule, we cannot miſcarry. To this Rule St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſends <hi>Timothy</hi> for Inſtruction, and commands him <hi>to give attendance to Reading, viz.</hi> the Holy Scriptures, <hi>which he had known from a Child, and which were able to make him wiſe to Salvation through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus: They being given by Inſpiration of God, that even a Man of God</hi> (like the antient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets) <hi>might be perfected, and throughly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all good Works,</hi> for every part of his Employment. St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs him to theſe Holy Writings, as a means to preſerve him in the Chriſtian Belief, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>But continue thou in the things which thou haſt le<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ned, and haſt been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them, and that from a Child thou hast learned the Holy Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. What we have learned from them, we are aſſured of, we know from whom they come, and are certain we are taught of God when we read theſe holy Books: But cannot be aſſured of any other <hi>Tradition</hi> or pretended <hi>Revelation of the Spirit,</hi> and therefore ought to continue ſtedfaſt in our adherence to the Scriptures, and both to ſuſpect thoſe who would draw us from this hold, and ſtick to thoſe <hi>Guides</hi> who bid us ſtick to this, and <hi>prove all things by it</hi>; for it is evident that they have no mind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us; but do, in effect, bid us <hi>believe God</hi> and follow <hi>his Directions,</hi> and rely upon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93927:19"/>
               <hi>his Authority:</hi> Who cannot miſlead us; and will not ſuffer us to be miſled, <hi>if we continue in the things which we have learned out of the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For taking them to be our <hi>Rule,</hi> we ſhall neither admit any thing which is contrary to that <hi>Rule</hi>; nor ſhall we take any thing to be an eſſential part of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> which is not there delivered unto us, For it is not conſiſtent with the Notions we have of God's Infinite Goodneſs and Wiſdom, to believe he would give us a <hi>Rule</hi> which is defective in neceſſary things. No, he hath abundantly provided here for our Inſtruction, in all ſuch Matters: And as we ought to <hi>refuſe</hi> that which contradicts any part of theſe <hi>holy Books,</hi> ſo we ought not to think it neceſſary that we ſhould entertain any thing which they do not teach us: And teach us <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>evidently</hi>; for in all neceſſary things they are very clear and perſpicuous, elſe they could not be a <hi>Rule</hi> unto us, but we muſt ſeek for ſome other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> for inſtance (which the Antients call the immovable Rule of Faith, a ſhort Summary of Chriſtian Faith, beyond which, as they ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ought not to ſeek for Faith) together with the <hi>Nice Creed</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s, which expound the <hi>Apoſtles, Ought throughly to be received and believed; for that they may be proved by most certain War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of Holy Scriptures. But whatſoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to required of any Man, that it ſhould be believed a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93927:19"/>
an Article of Faith, or be thought requiſite or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in its <hi>Sixth</hi> and <hi>Eighth Articles,</hi> unto which let us ſtrictly keep, if we would not be carried to and fro uncertainly, with the Blaſts of vain Doctrines, which have no <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Warrant</hi> in the Holy Scriptures, and therefore are not to be <hi>Received</hi>; or are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them, and therefore are to be <hi>Reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Here we muſt <hi>fix,</hi> and believe that here we are <hi>ſafe:</hi> For the Scriptures want nothing to compleat us in Chriſtian Wiſdom; which they do not wrap up in Obſcurity, but, as far as is needful, give us a clear underſtanding of the Doctrines of Faith. And make us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand withal, if we pleaſe to conſider them, that having laid our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Foundation well, in a firm Belief of thoſe great and neceſſary things, which out of the Scriptures are ſummed up in the <hi>Creeds</hi> before named; we need not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves about other Matters, which are not ſo evident; but make it our whole Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this World, to raiſe the ſolid Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure of a <hi>Holy Life,</hi> upon the Foundation of <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The laſt Reaſon I ſhall mention at this time, is, That this Church has not ſuited her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to advance any ſecular Intereſts; but her Religion is <hi>Heavenly</hi> in its Principle, and <hi>Pure</hi> in its Aim, diſdaining to ſtoop to mean Arts for Wealth and Worldly Dignities. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93927:20"/>
was deſigned as the greateſt Bleſſing to Mankind, and the Author of the Chriſtian was a great Lover of humane Race; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to whoſe bleſſed Example this <hi>Holy Church</hi> cancels none of our Obligations to God or Man, but teacheth the abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>Contrition,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> of our Luſts, to Obey our <hi>Superiors,</hi> to Love <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> to follow <hi>Juſtice, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Peaceableneſs:</hi> To be <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable</hi> to the <hi>Poor, and to do to all Men as we would they ſhould do by us:</hi> To uſe no <hi>Craft</hi> or <hi>Equivocations,</hi> but to be <hi>Sincere</hi> in all our Actions and Profeſſions; to live in <hi>Kindneſs, Civility,</hi> and under the firmeſt Obligation to a true and laſting <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> And if any of the <hi>Quakers</hi> think fit to oppoſe theſe <hi>Doctrines,</hi> they may promiſe themſelves an Anſwer.</p>
