         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I should have contented my self with a personal
Dedication thereof. But being the accompt of a
Solemn Embassy, sent to two of the greatest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> upon so Publick and Noble a Design
as that of the <hi>Silk-Trade,</hi> carried on with vast charge and
many difficulties, for several years, the address of my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
herein is most properly due to that Body of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi>
to whom the advancement of our Trade into those
Parts is particularly recommended. It is not unknown to
you, what opposition this Negotiation met withall from the
several Parties therein concern'd; and consequently, you can
best judge, what advantages may be made thereof, in order
to the Interest of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>The Travels of particular Persons have their benefit and
delight; but those of Ambassadors have this further recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
that they contain such Discoveries, as having
been made to Them, out of a deference to their Publick and
Sacred Character, were not to be expected by any others, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
only upon a Private Accompt. They were first pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
<pb facs="tcp:47786:5"/>
by <hi>Adam Olearius,</hi> a Person, by his near Relation
to the Embassy, (whereof he was Secretary) his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Mathematicks, but particularly his Acquaintance
with the Languages of the Countries, through which they
Travell'd, perfectly accomplish'd for a Work of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>What he writ of these Travels in his own Language, the

READER</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ISTORY hath this advantage of <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
that it instructs more efficaciously; this,
of <hi>Romance,</hi> that it is more divertive; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as <hi>Examples</hi> make a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
than <hi>Precepts,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> Instils
into rational minds a satisfaction, which
they find not in <hi>Fables.</hi> But <hi>Travels</hi>
have this over and above, that they do
both incomparably better than <hi>History.</hi>
For as, on one side, a man, reflecting on the
<hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> of divers Nations, deduces thence useful Lessons
of <hi>Prudence,</hi> and delightfully surveys the strange <hi>Circulations</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature; so, on the other, he finds the greater divertisement in
the <hi>Relations,</hi> out of this regard, that he participates of the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
which charms the Travellers, but not of the <hi>hardships, hazards,</hi>
and <hi>inconveniences</hi> wherewith they are attended.</p>
                  <p>The Travels into <hi>Muscovy</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> publish'd by <hi>Adam Olea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
have been so well receiv'd by such as were able to judge of
the worth of that Piece, that I dare presume, others will take it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to find, in this Edition, what he had promis'd the World in his
first. The aboad he had made at <hi>Moscou</hi> and <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he had acquir'd of the Language of the Country, had, as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
then, brought him acquainted with the mysteries of their
Religion; but printing his Book in some hast, he omitted many
things, which he should otherwise have inserted. He hath since
done it at leisure, so fully, that it seems to be quite another Relation,
in as much as, considering this Revision, what is now publish'd is
both a more curious, and more compleat Piece. They will find that
<pb facs="tcp:47786:6"/>
he hath added thereto the Maps of <hi>LIVONIA, MVSCOVY,</hi> the <hi>CAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PIAN-SEA,
PERSIA,</hi> and the <hi>INDIES,</hi> and, what may be justly
accounted the greatest curiosity, the <hi>Course of the Great River
WOLGA,</hi> whereof there had been little seen in these parts before,
and without which, it were impossible to track the Travellors through
all those remote Countries. Besides which, there is, in this Edition
of ours, a Map of <hi>CHINA,</hi> and several other pieces of Sculpture, for
the further satisfaction and entertainment of the Reader.</p>
                  <p>There is no necessity of repeating here what the Preface of the first
Edition entertain'd the Reader withall, concerning the occasion of
the Embassy, sent by the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> into <hi>Muscovy</hi> and <hi>Persia;</hi>
the endowments and worth of that great Prince; the noble design he
had fram'd to himself, for carrying on the <hi>Silk-Trade</hi> by Land; the
difficulties, or rather impossibilities, which happened in the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof; the insolent, rash, and extravagant carriage of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
<hi>Brugman,</hi> his treacherous designs, and unfortunate end:
But I cannot forbear giving some account of the Illustrious <hi>Iohn Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
de Mandelslo,</hi> the <hi>Heroe,</hi> of the Travels into the <hi>East-Indies,</hi>
which title I give him, in regard there are in his Travels some mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
adventures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>MANDELSLO,</hi> a Gentleman well born, had his Education at
the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi>'s Court, to whom he had been a Page. Hearing
of an Embassy intended for <hi>Muscovy</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> he would needs be
one in it; and as if he were that <hi>Vertuous Man,</hi> who looks upon the
whole World as his Country, he would not depant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
his Prince's leave, to see the other parts of <hi>Asia.</hi> During his
aboad at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> he got acquainted with some <hi>English</hi> Merchants,
who, speaking to him of the <hi>Indies,</hi> rais'd in him a desire to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The King of <hi>Persia,</hi> to engage his stay at his Court, proffers
him a Pension of ten thousand Crowns; he slights the favour of so
great a Prince, gets on horse-back, with no great Sums about him,
and sets forward on his Journey, with a retinue of three <hi>German</hi>
Servants, and one <hi>Persian,</hi> who was to be his Guide and Interpreter,
but forsook him, when he stood in most need of his service and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.
It was also a very strange Adventure, which made him
find civil entertainment and hospitality at <hi>Surat;</hi> made him subsist
at the charge of others; conducted him by Land to the Great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul</hi>'s
Court; brought him safely back again to <hi>Surat;</hi> preserv'd the
ship he was in after so many tempests near the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope;</hi>
and miraculously deliver'd him at his first arrival into <hi>England,</hi>
when he was given over for irrecoverably lost in the very haven, as
may be seen neer the end of his Travels.</p>
                  <p>To these <hi>Mandelslo</hi> had a particular inclination, and knew so well
<pb facs="tcp:47786:6"/>
how to make his advantages thereof, that <hi>Olearius</hi> himself makes no
difficulty to confess, that he met with, in his Notes, many things,
which might have been added to his Relation, and have found a kind
reception even among the more Curious, had he been as forward to
have his Travels publish'd, as he had been to prosecute them.
But <hi>Mandelslo,</hi> instead of giving the world that satisfaction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
with his Friend, who might have further'd him in his design,
left the Court of <hi>Holstein,</hi> where he found not employment propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to his merit, and betaking himself to another Profession, he
got into a Regiment of Horse, commanded by a <hi>German,</hi> who, purely
by his Military accomplishments, had rais'd himself to one of the
greatest dignities of <hi>France.</hi> He had therein the Command of a
Troop, and, being a person of much courage, and endu'd with all
the qualities requisite to the making up of a great man, was likely to
have rais'd himself to a more than ordinary fortune, when coming
to <hi>Paris</hi> to pass away the Winter, he there died, of the small Pox.</p>
                  <p>Being at <hi>Surat,</hi> in <hi>December</hi> 1638. he made a kind of <hi>Will,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Papers, which he put before the beginning of his Relation,
wherein he desir'd his Friend <hi>Olearius,</hi> not to suffer it to be publish'd,
in regard he had not had the leisure to digest it into order, or if he
did, that he would rather regard therein his reputation after his
death, than the friendship they had mutually promis'd one another,
and faithfully improv'd, during the four years of their joynt-Travels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mandelslo</hi> was no great Scholar, but could make a shift to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
a Latin Author, which helpt him much in the attaining of the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Language, wherein he came to a considerable perfection.
His Friend taught him also the use of the <hi>Astrolabe,</hi> so that he was
able to take the Longitudes and Latitudes that are in several places
of his Book, and without which it had been impossible for him, to be
much skill'd in Geography, which makes the most considerable
part of this kind of Relations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olearius</hi> hath indeed been very much his Friend, not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
and refining his Style, which could not be very elegant in a
person of his Profession, but also in making several observations and
additions thereto, printing it in <hi>Folio,</hi> in a very fair character, and
adorning it with several pieces of Sculpture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olearius</hi>'s kindness to his Friend, in enriching his Relation, with
many excellent remarks, taken out of <hi>Emanuel Osorio, Maffaeus,</hi> and
the chief Voyages of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> gave the <hi>French</hi> Translator thereof,
<hi>A de VVicquefort,</hi> occasion to augment the said Book with whatever
he found excellent in all those, who have given the best account of
the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> So that it is to him we are oblig'd for the exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the Province of <hi>Guzuratta,</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:47786:7"/>
                     <hi>Siam, &amp;c.</hi> the state of the affairs of <hi>Zeilon, Sumatra, Iava,</hi> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucca</hi>'s
and <hi>Iapan,</hi> as also for the Religions of these people. So that
there is, in this Edition of ours, especially as to the Travels of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delslo,</hi>
a third part more than there is in the largest of the <hi>German</hi>
Editions.</p>
                  <p>The Reader will find therein many things, which will haply seem
incredible to him, as, among others, he may haply be astonish'd at
the wealth of a Governour of <hi>Amadabah,</hi> and at that of a King of
<hi>Indosthan,</hi> as also at the vast revenues of the Provinces and Lords of
<hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapan;</hi> but, besides that there is nothing of Romance in all
this, and that there is no comparison to be made between the wealth
of <hi>Europe</hi> and that of <hi>Asia,</hi> there are many persons, in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>England,</hi> that will justifie our Relation, though it said much more
than it does.</p>
                  <p>I might here trouble the Reader with what I find in the Learned
<hi>Isaac Vossius</hi>'s <hi>Observations</hi> upon <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> (Lib. 3. c. 5. v. 16.
concerning the length and breadth of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, wherein he
differs from our Author, and prefers the measure of it by our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman
<hi>Ienkinson,</hi> before that of <hi>Olearius.</hi> But I choose rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
the more critical to the place it self, and leave them to satisfie
their own curiosity, by conferring what is there said by <hi>Vossius,</hi>
with the account given by <hi>Olearius,</hi> of the said Sea, <hi>pag.</hi> 190, 191,
192. of this <hi>English</hi> Edition of the Travels.</p>

                     </gap> only this to add that the <hi>French</hi> Translator, <hi>de Wicquefort,</hi>
promises the world (if it be not abroad already) a Piece of his own;
which coming out under the authentick name of <hi>History,</hi> will contain
some thing beyond what may be expected from a Relation.</p>

<hi>Frederick</hi> made his residence, and went to <hi>Hamborough,</hi> where they took order for their

took into their service an experienc'd Sea-Captain named <hi>Michael Cordes,</hi> who was to
be their Pilot, especially upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea.</p>
                     <p>The 9. we took leave of our Friends,<note place="margin">They em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark.</note> who had come along with us from <hi>Hamborough,</hi> and
embarqu'd in a Ship called the <hi>Fortune,</hi> whereof <hi>Iohn Muller</hi> was Commander. We took

Physician to the Great Duke.</p>
                     <p>We got out of the Haven about 2. in the afternoon, and anchor'd in the Road at 8. fathom
water.<note place="margin">Orders for civil beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</note> About 9. at night, the wind South-West, we set sail, and made that night 20. leagues.
The next day, the Ambassadors thought fit to make some particular Orders to be observ'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our Voyage, so to prevent the disorders which are but too frequent among those, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
leave not their own Country, but out of a hope to live with greater freedom else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
and to see the execution of them the better performed, they named several Officers,
giving the Secretary of the Embassy the quality of Fiscal, and to <hi>Wendelin Sibelist,</hi> and <hi>Hartman
Gramem,</hi> our Physician, that of Assessors. They discharg'd their places well, and Justice was

came to above 22. Crowns, which were put into the hands of the Captain, with order they
should be equally distributed between the Poor of <hi>Riga</hi> and <hi>Lubeck.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The same day,<note place="margin">Bornholm.</note> toward evening, we pass'd by the Island of <hi>Bornholm,</hi> leaving it a good league
on the right hand. That Island is conceiv'd to be distant from <hi>Lubeck</hi> 40. German Leagues.
The length and breadth of it is neer the same, <hi>viz.</hi> 3. leagues; it hath a Royal Palace, named
<hi>Hammershausen,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> Towards the North-side of the Island are
the Rocks called <hi>Erdholm,</hi> well known by reason of the frequent wracks, which make them so
much the more formidable to Mariners in the Autumn, in regard the darkness of the nights
keeps them from being discover'd, and that all about them those that sound meet with no
bottom.</p>
                     <p>The 11. at noon, we were at 56. degrees of latitude, the weather continuing fair; but, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
night, the wind, still at South-West, rais'd such a tempest, that we were forc'd to take
in all our sails, and go before the wind till the next morning. Those among us who were not us'd
to the Sea,<note place="margin">Sea sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> were so sick, that some vomited blood: but in regard we had the wind a-stern, it's
violence hindred us not from keeping on our course, and making fifteen Leagues that night.</p>
                     <p>Some are of opinion,<note place="margin">Its cause.</note> that the stinch of the salt water, corrupting in the sink, is that which
provokes such vomiting. Others, on the contrary, affirm, that it is caused by the violent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Ship, which makes the head turn, and the stomack to cast up what is in it. But
certain it is, that both contribute thereto, in as much as if the agitation trouble the brain, the
stinch also offends it, and makes those heart-sick whose smelling is subtile, provoking vomiting,
even without any violent motion, wherever they are, not only at Sea, but also any where else.
Those who conceive, that people are not subject hereto upon Rivers are deceiv'd; for, besides
that experience hath evinc'd the contrary, we have there the same motion, and fresh water being
corrupted, stinks no less than the salt.</p>

from seeing us, we caus'd the Trumpets to sound, to oblige them to send us a Pilot, without
whose assistance we should hardly have got into the Haven. Those who had the oversight of
the Customes, came immediately to search our Ship, but finding no Merchants goods in it, for
which they might challenge ought, they return'd back, and sent us a Pilot, who conducted us
that night as far as before the City of <hi>Riga.</hi>

The Knights of the <hi>Espadon,</hi> and, afterwards, the Master of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order in
<hi>Prussia,</hi> have, many times, divided the administration of Justice and the Soveraignty in that
place, with the Archbishop, till that, in consequence of the Reformation of Religion, both
lost the Authority they had in this City. It was forc'd afterwards to have recourse to the
Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47786:14"/>
conceiving he might turn into an Offensive War, that which even in the Defensive was crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
he enter'd <hi>Livonia</hi> in the Year 1605. where he besieg'd the City of <hi>Riga.</hi> He was forc'd
to raise the siege; as also to do the like in the year 1609. but <hi>Gustavus Adolphus</hi> was so fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
as to take it, in the year 1621.<note place="margin">Taken by the <hi>Suedes.</hi>
                        </note> Ever since that time, the <hi>Suedes.</hi> have been in possession
of it, though without any Title thereto; the Treaty agreed on between the two Crowns in
the year 1635. allowing them the possession of it no longer than till the Peace, which was to
be made between the two Kings, should restore it to it's lawful Prince, or bestow it on him
who was possess'd of it. The <hi>Suedes</hi> discover how unwilling they would be to restore it, by
the care they took when we were upon our Travels, to carry on the Fortifications thereof.
They consist,<note place="margin">Its fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</note> on the land side, of six regular Bastions, with their Half-moons, and their
Counterscarps Palisadoed. It's situation is very pleasant, in a spacions Valley, upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Dune,</hi> which in that place, is a large quarter of a League broad. It is very populous,
and very considerable because of its Commerce, as well with the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and
the Hansiatick Towns,<note place="margin">Its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</note> in Summer time, while the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea is Navigable, as with the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> when the frost and snow can bear Sledges. The Traffick of it is so great, that it
hath almost as many Shops as Houses. All Provisions are very cheap, because there is such an
abundance of all, that an Ox may be bought for three Crowns, a Hog for one, and Fowl and
Venison proportionably, all the Country Peasants thereabouts having the liberty to Hunt,
though they have not any other. Since the last reduction of it, they have no other Religion
there than the Protestant, the Magistrate and Inhabitants being all Lutherans, and so zealous
in their way, that they no less hate those of the Reformation, than they do the Catholicks,
and Muscovites. There is no Inhabitant almost but understands the Highdutch, the Sclavonian,
and Curland Language; but the Magistrate in his publick Acts makes use only of the Highdutch.
The same is used by the Ministers in their Sermons, unless it be that for the meaner sort of
people, who understand not the Highdutch well, there are Sermons made in the Sclavonian
and Curland Language, in two several Churches.</p>

Ceremonies of their Anniversary, and their Devotions towards their deceas'd Kinred and

they had lay'd dishes full of fish broyl'd and fry'd, Custards, Cakes, and painted Eggs. Some
stood; others kneel'd, making divers questions to their Kinred, weeping over their Graves,
and expressing their affliction by dreadful howlings; but with so little attention, that they
slipp'd no occasion of speaking, nor indeed of laughing with those of their acquaintance who
pass'd by. The Priest, attended by his Clerks, walk'd up and down the Church-yard, having
in his hand a Censer, into which he ever and anon cast little pieces of Wax, to cense the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers.
The women named to him, those of their Kinred and Friends whom they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to his prayers, pulling him by the surplice to be serv'd one before the other. The
Priest did this devotion very slightly, and with so little attention, that he was but too well
pay'd with the piece of Copper they gave, so far was he from deserving the Provisions they
brought him, which his Clerks had a care to secure for the advantage of their Master.</p>

off the beauty of the Ladies,<note place="margin">The civility of the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi> Ladies.</note> who indeed needed not that foil. They drank each of them a Cup

the <hi>Muscovites</hi> think they can do strangers; unless it be, that, to make it a transcendent
civility, they also suffer them to be kiss'd. This civility Count <hi>Alexander Slakou</hi> did me,
when the Duke my Master sent me since into <hi>Muscovy,</hi> in the year 1643. in acknowledgement
of the honour he had receiv'd in our Court, during his Exile. This <hi>Bojar's</hi> name was <hi>N. Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovits.</hi>
He was a very handsome person, and of an excellent good humour. He told us he had
been in the Wars of <hi>Germany;</hi> that in the year 1631. he was at the battel of <hi>Leipsig,</hi> and shew'd
us the scars of the wounds he had receiv'd there.</p>
                     <p>The last of <hi>May,</hi> at one afternoon, we took leave of him, and got four Leagues that day,

the next day, <hi>Iune</hi> 2. and came the same day to <hi>Noteburg,</hi> where we stay'd above six weeks,
in expectation of the Great Duke's orders for our reception. The Governour of the place, <hi>Iohn
Kunemund,</hi> cross'd the River in a Boat, made, and cover'd like a Gondole, to come and meet
us. The <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors kept open house during their stay at <hi>Noteburg,</hi> and every meal
sent their Mareshall, a place like that of High Steward in the Courts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of their retinue, to invite and conduct to them the Ambassadors of <hi>Holstein.</hi>

                           <hi>Spiring,</hi> a fifth Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador from <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, a Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> born, and sometime an Arras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaver. The <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors depart</note> Farmer General of the Outland customs of
<hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Livonia,</hi> one of the Ambassadors design'd from <hi>Sueden,</hi> for <hi>Muscovy. Iune</hi> 25. the
<hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors had intelligence that the <hi>Weywode</hi> or Governour of <hi>Novogorod</hi> had sent a
<hi>Pristaf,</hi> to receive them upon the Frontiers, which oblig'd them to depart the next day to go to
<hi>Laba.</hi> Ours accompany'd them four Leagues from <hi>Noteburg,</hi> and permitted me to follow the
<hi>Suedes</hi> even to the Frontier, to see the Ceremonies of their reception. The 27. at four in the
morning, we came to the River which is about 40 paces broad, and, in that place, serves for a
Frontier between <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Muscovy.</hi> The Ambassadors having understood, that there were
on the other side of the River seventeen Boats, for their waftage over, sent immediately their
Interpreter to the <hi>Pristaf,</hi> to desire him to send some of them to bring over the baggage, so to
facilitate their reception. The <hi>Pristaf,</hi> who was an aged man, made answer, that he durst not
do it, and that they were not to imagine, the expences of one day, which they should not think
much to lose, would be any inconvenience to the <hi>Czaar</hi> his Master (so the <hi>Muscovites</hi> call
their Prince) and that he must begin with the reception of the Ambassadors. About noon he
sent to them his Interpreter, with four Musketiers, whom they call <hi>Strelits,</hi> whereof he had
about thirty to wait on him at this Ceremony, to tell them, that he was ready to give them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.<note place="margin">A <hi>Suedish</hi> resolution.</note>
One of the Ambassadors made him answer somewhat roundly, yet civilly enough, that
they had been five weeks upon the Frontiers, and that the <hi>Pristaf</hi> could not take it ill, if they
made him stay one day; That his Collegues being then taking their rest, he could not make
him an absolute answer, and that he should have notice, when they could pass the River with
their convenience. The Ambassadors were indeed asleep, which happen'd as well in regard
they had travell'd all night,<note place="margin">The <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> sleep after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> as that, being come to the Frontiers of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> they comply'd
with the custom of the Countrey, where sleep is as necessary after Dinner as in the Night. One
of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors ask'd the Interpreter, when those of <hi>Holstein</hi> would be receiv'd;
he told him he could not tell, but, as he thought, it would be three weeks first, that is, after
the arrival of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors at <hi>Moscou,</hi> because the same horses and carriages were
to bring them thither. About 4. afternoon, the Ambassadors gave notice they were ready to
crosse the River, and that the <hi>Pristaf</hi> had no more to do but to receive them; whereupon they,
with their Interpreter, went into one Boat, and I with some of their Gentlemen into another.
The <hi>Pristaf</hi> got into another, accompany'd by fifteen <hi>Muscovites</hi> in very good order; but to
express the greatness of his Prince, the Boat-men, who were instructed how to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
put off so slowly that they could hardly quit the shore, forbearing ever and anon to row,
purposely to let the Ambassadors get before, which method was also observ'd by the Boat-man
that carried over the Ambassadors. But <hi>Philip Scheiding,</hi> perceiving the intention of the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
calls to the <hi>Pristaf,</hi> telling him, that pride was not seasonable at that time, that he
should come forward, and consider, that that kind of proceeding would conduce as little to the
advantage of the Great Duke, as to the disadvantage of their Prince. At last the Boats being all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47786:16"/>
come to the middle of the River, the <hi>Pristaf</hi> advanc'd, and read out of a paper, That the Great
Duke and <hi>Czaar, Michael Federouits,</hi> &amp;c. had ordered the reception of the Ambassadors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Crown of <hi>Sueden,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</note> and that he had given command, they should be provided for,
they and their retinue, with Provisions and all things necessary, till they came to the Citie of
<hi>Mosco.</hi> After the Ambassadors had answered the Complement, the <hi>Pristaf</hi> brought them
ashore, and conducted them to a Gentlemans house who was of the quality they call <hi>Simbojar,</hi>
not far from the River, where they were receiv'd into a little Stove, black as Hell, by reason
of the smoakiness, yet had they then made a fire, never considering the sultriness of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">A <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
which indeed was extreme. They treated the Ambassadors with spic'd bread, some
gobelets of a very strong kind of Aquavitae, and with two sorts of very bad Hydromel. The
Ambassadors only put it to their lips, and having pass'd the Cup from hand to hand, the last
presented it to me, with this commendation, <hi>addatur parum sulphuris &amp; fiet potio infernalis.</hi>
After this banquet, which lasted about an hour, during which time, the <hi>Muscovite</hi> Muketiers
gave several volleys such as they were, the Ambassadors and the <hi>Pristaf</hi> departed; the <hi>Suedes</hi>
in twelve Boats, and the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> with Colours and Drum, in three. I return'd to <hi>Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
where our Ambassadors continued three weeks, as the <hi>Pristaf</hi> had foretold.</p>
                     <p>The Countrey, which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> call <hi>Osinca,</hi> about <hi>Notebourg,</hi> is very pleasant, so
that we wanted no divertisement, especially that of hunting. Within a quarter of a League of
<hi>Notebourg</hi> are two Isles, distant one from the other, as far as a Musket will carry, both well
stor'd with wood, and so furnish'd with Fowl that our pieces could hardly be at rest for them,
and the Sea-dogs, whereof there is an incredible number in the Lake, found us excellent sport,
when they expos'd themselves to the Sun along the Rocks. We had also the learned and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
conversation of Mr. <hi>Peter Crusbiorn,</hi> who came, during that time, to <hi>Notebourg,</hi> with a
design to go into <hi>Mvscovy,</hi> in the quality of Resident from the Crown of <hi>Sueden.</hi> This place is
situated at 63. degrees,<note place="margin">The situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg.</hi>
                        </note> 30. minutes, at the entrance of the Lake <hi>Ladoga,</hi> upon an Isle, which
the said Lake makes there in form like a Nut, which gives it the name. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> had
built it, and encompass'd it with a wall, two fathom and a half thick, against the attempts of
the <hi>Suedes,</hi> who took it, under the command of <hi>Iames de la Garde,</hi> after the extremities of the
siege, and a contagious disease had consum'd the whole Garrison to two men, who yet made a
very advantageous Capitulation. The place is pleasant and delightfull, but not healthy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the fresh-water Lakes and Fenns that ly about it. We were extremely troubled there
with a kind of Fly much like those which in Latine are called <hi>Pyraustae,</hi> whereof there was such
abundance, that many times they depriv'd us of the sight of Heaven, and would not suffer us to
open our eyes. These insects are also very numerous in <hi>Carelia,</hi> but not neer so much as at
<hi>Notebourg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iuly</hi> 16.<note place="margin">JULY.</note> Notice was brought us, that a <hi>Pristaf,</hi> named <hi>Simon Andrew Kareckshin,</hi> was
come to the Frontiers,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors came to <hi>Laba.</hi>
                        </note> to receive us; so that we put all things in order for our journey, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
the 20. for <hi>Laba.</hi> We were no sooner got thither, but the <hi>Pristaf</hi>'s Interpreter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
by a Musketier, came to know, whether the Ambassadors desir'd to be received?
In answer whereto, we asking, whether he would receive us on this side, or in the middle of the
River, as he had receiv'd the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors; he told us, we had no more to do but to
pass, and that those Ceremonies were observ'd only with the <hi>Suedes,</hi> because of the contest
there is between them about the Frontiers.</p>
                     <p>Having pass'd the River,<note place="margin">Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</note> we found the <hi>Pristaf</hi> standing within 8 or 10 paces of the shore, clad
in a long Coat of red Damask. As soon as the Ambassadors had set foot on land, he came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, being still cover'd, till such time as he began to speak. Then he took off his Cap, as
he pronounc'd the Great Duke's name, reading out of a paper these words, <hi>His Majestie, the
Czaar,</hi> Michael Federouits, <hi>Conservator of all the</hi> Russians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath sent me hither, to receive
thee, <hi>Philip Crusius,</hi> and thee, <hi>Otton Brugman,</hi> Ambassadors from the Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> and
commanded me to accommodate you and retinue, with Provisions, Carriages Horses, and
what else shall be necessary, till you come to the Citie of <hi>Moscou.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Interpreter, whose name was <hi>Anthony,</hi> spoke High-Dutch so ill, that we had much
ado to understand him. The Ambassadors made answer by their own Interpreter, <hi>Iohn Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penbeck,</hi>
who was very well vers'd in the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Language. This done, The <hi>Pristaf</hi> gave
the Ambassadours the upper hand, and conducted them to the Inn, through a party of twelve
Musketiers, all <hi>Cosaques.</hi> The volley they gave us was not so well discharg'd, but that the
Secretary belonging to the Resident of <hi>Sueden,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Another <hi>Muscovian</hi> Collation.</note> who came along with us to see the Ceremonies
of our reception, was shot in his Buff-coat. After a collation of Ginger-Bread, Cherries newly
preserv'd, and Aquavitae, we took water again, and embark'd for the continuation of our Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
After we had dined with the Governour of <hi>Notebourg,</hi> who came along with us thither,
and who treated us that day with several sorts of pleasant drinks, we were dispos'd into seven
Boats.<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors prosecute their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 22. we pass'd the Lake <hi>Ladoga,</hi> which in that place is 12 leagues over. We landed neer
a Monastery called <hi>Nauolkus Konsky,</hi> where he met with a Monk, who presented us with bread
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47786:16"/>
and dry'd Salmon. The <hi>Pristaf</hi> who was to bear our charges, ask'd whether he should provide
for us, or that we had rather take the money allow'd by his Majesty for our entertainment, and
have our meat dress'd by our own Cooks. We made choice of the later, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of those Ambassadors who go into those parts. So that we bought our provisions our
selves, which we found cheap enough, in comparison to what the <hi>Pristaf</hi> provided for us. Two
<hi>Copecks,</hi> which make two sols French, would buy a tame Fowl, and for a peny we had nine
Eggs. We were allow'd every day two Roubles and five <hi>Copecks,</hi> amounting to four Crowns
five pence, which found us very good fare. After dinner, we embark'd on a River which
brought us to <hi>Ladoga,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Come to <hi>Ladoga.</hi>
                        </note> which is distant from <hi>Laba</hi> 17 leagues, whither we came the same night.
We met by the way a <hi>Pristaf,</hi> going to meet the <hi>Suedish</hi> Resident, with three Boats. In all
our Travels had we not seen so many Children under 7 years of age, as we found at <hi>Ladoga.</hi>
Some of ours being gone to take the Air, they run after us, having Goosberies to sell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we bought a hatful for a <hi>Copeck.</hi> 'Twas pleasant to see those Children, to the number of fifty
together, leaping about us, as we lay on the grass to eat our Goosberries, so dress'd as that we
could not distinguish the Boies from the Girls, for both had their hair cut all off, excepting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two mustaches, which were suffer'd to grow at their Temples, and were clad in shirts reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their ancles. Our Physician would needs make a discovery of sexes among them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
caught one of the Children by the shirt, it happened to be a Boy, who told him laughing,
<hi>Deske niet,</hi> that he was no Girl, and thereupon pointed to some that were.</p>
                     <p>The 23. at dinner,<note place="margin">The Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick of <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
                        </note> was the first time we heard any of the Country Musick, which consisted
of a Lute and Violin, with some voices, singing aires to the honour of their <hi>Czaar, Michael Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouits,</hi>
and perceiving they were permitted, they fell a-dancing after a strange manner. The
men and women danc'd much after the same manner, every one alone, making strange faces,
with as strange gesticulations; the motions of the hands, shoulders, and hips, being more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than those of the feet, which they do but gently stir, not moving as it were from the same
place. The women have commonly handkerchers in their hands, fring'd with silk of divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
which they cast about their heads.</p>
                     <p>After dinner we embark'd upon the River <hi>Wolgda.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wolgda.</note> Our Musketiers, or <hi>Strelits,</hi> begg'd the
benediction of a Monk that happen'd to be by the River side; it being their custom to beg it of
all Monks,<note place="margin">The devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi>
                        </note> and in all the Churches they come to by the way, which if they have not the time to
go into, they think it enough to do reverences to the Crosses they see upon the Churches and
Chapels, pronouncing these words, <hi>Hospodi Buchmilo,</hi> that is to say, Lord be merciful to me.</p>
                     <p>The wind being with us, it was thought fit we should make use of our sails, but, the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
being not the most expert Mariners, one of the Ropes broke, and the sail falling on one of
the Musketiers, struck him down so as that we gave him over for dead, but coming to himself
again within an hour after, and having taken a considerable dram of the Aquavitae bottle, he was
as well as ever.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Wolgda</hi> is as broad as <hi>Elbe,</hi>

of the Lake called the Lake of <hi>Ilmen,</hi> and falls into that of <hi>Ladoga.</hi> Seven <hi>werstes</hi> (whereof five

                        <note place="margin">A dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fall of water.</note> there is a strange fall of Water in that River, and about
a league and a half thence, another, where the water falls with such violence, that it runs like a
shaft, amidst the many Rocks scatter'd up and down neer those places: in so much that to draw
the loaden Boats up the River, there needs above a hundred men. We got ashore at the former,
and saw our Boats pass safely, all save the last, in which we had left <hi>Simon Frisius,</hi> a Merchant's
Son of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> who being extremely sick was forc'd to stay in it. This Boat being drawn
up to the highest pitch of the water, the rope broke, so that the water forc'd it back with such
violence, that it would have split against the Rocks, if, by an unexpected good hap, one end of
the rope, which was fasten'd to the mast, had not twin'd it self about one of the Rocks, by
which means the Boat was stay'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till we had the convenience to dis-engage it. There we were
told, that a certain Bishop, coming that way in a Boat laden with Fish, had been cast away some
few dayes before. The other fall we pass'd without any danger, and came that night to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
called <hi>Nicolai Nepostiza,</hi> where we took up our quarters, and stay'd the next day, expecting
the Boats that were coming after us.</p>

such abundance of Flies, Gnats, and Wasps, that people have much ado to keep them off, in so

such as Travellers make use of in <hi>Livonia</hi> and <hi>Muscovy:</hi> those among us who had not been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to cover themselves, having their faces so sported, as if they were newly recover'd from the

                     <p>There were but four Monks in the Convent; the most aged among them made us a Present of
Turneps, pickled Cowcumbers, some green Pease, and two wax candles. We gratify'd him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47786:17"/>
with a Crown piece, which he took so kindly, that he let us into his Church, contrary to the
Custom of the Country, and put on his Sacerdotal Vestments, that we might see them. He
shew'd us, in the Portal, the Miracles of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> painted according to the mode of the
Country, very roughly, and without proportion. Upon the door was represented the last
Judgement, wherein the Monk pointed to a Man habited after the <hi>German</hi> fashion, and told
us,<note place="margin">The <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn those of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary belief.</note> That the <hi>Germans</hi> and other Nations were not uncapable of Salvation, provided they had
a <hi>Muscovite</hi> Soul, and that they lived justly in the sight of God. He shew'd us also a Bible in
his own Language (for no <hi>Muscovite</hi> knows any other than his own and the <hi>Sclavonian</hi>) and
read to us the first Chapter of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel, which we found absolutely conformable to our
Text. To which he added, that being once at <hi>Reuel,</hi> he had there had a conference with some
of our Pastors, concerning the Holy Scripture; but that he could give them no great satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because he did not well understand the <hi>German</hi> Interpreter. He would have shewn us all
the Church, but our Musketiers coming in grumbled at it, and reproach'd him for having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
too much to us. We gave him the tother Crown, for which he gave us many thanks,
bowing his head to the very ground, and smiting it with his forehead. We intended to have
made our repast upon the grass, but were hardly set, ere the wind turning for us, the
Monk brings us another prefent of Turneps and Cowcumbers, telling us, that the kindness
we had done him had obtain'd of S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the good wind which was to carry us on in our
Voyage.</p>
                     <p>About 2. afternoon, we set off, made four leagues that day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

called <hi>Cerodiza:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Corodiza.</note> but finding it more pleasant to be by the water side, than in a Village, we
caus'd our meat to dress'd there, and supp'd, while the Marriners, who made accompt to goe
thence that night, took some hours rest.</p>
                     <p>We slept not, but made sport with a young Bear, the <hi>Pristaf</hi> had brought us, which could
shew a thousand tricks. After midnight we set forward, and got four leagues to the Village
<hi>Soliza;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Soliza.</note> where the <hi>Pristaf,</hi> who had stay'd at <hi>Corodiza,</hi> overtook us, bringing along with
him his Host, who was a <hi>Knez,</hi> or <hi>Muscovite</hi> Prince, named <hi>Roman Iovanouits.</hi> He had
treated him so well, that both were got drunk: however, seeing they were still desirous to
drink, we supply'd them so well with <hi>Aquavitae</hi> and Sack, whereof we had good store, that
we laid them asleep.</p>
                     <p>We got that day six leagues to a Village called <hi>Grunza,</hi> which the Country people had also
absolutely forsaken,<note place="margin">Grunza.</note> which oblig'd us to take up our Lodging in the Fields, in a Meadow near

                        </gap> telling of stories, and diverting our selves with the
Bear. The Musketiers, who had been somewhat busy with the Aquavitae, entertain'd us with
some feats of their activity. Here we saw abundance of Cranes, and counted, upon the Pool,
above 300 of them.</p>
                     <p>The next day, <hi>Iul.</hi> 26. about three in the morning we prosecuted our Voyage, and before

hearing the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> pronounc'd, made the sign of the Cross several times upon his breast,
and desir'd to have our Prayer in writing, and liked it so well, that he said, he could not have
believ'd, that the <hi>Germans</hi> were so good Christians, and so just men.</p>
                     <p>The 27. all day, and the night following, we prosecuted our Voyage, so that the 28. with
the day, we were come to the Village of <hi>Krifseuiza.</hi> There we staid that day, to give the
<hi>Pristaf</hi> time to acquaint the Governour of <hi>Novogorod</hi> with our arrival,<note place="margin">Krifseuiza.</note> and to know his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
concerning our reception.</p>
                     <p>This Village is within 2 leagues of <hi>Novogorod,</hi> and about 600 paces from it is a very fair Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
which some call <hi>Nachatim,,</hi> but it is commonly called <hi>Krifseuiza Chutina Spasof
Monastir.</hi> It is well built, and better situated, having an Abbot, 60 Monks, and 400 Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
people to husband the grounds belonging to it: but it is oblig'd out of its Revenue
to maintain a hundred men of the Garrison of <hi>Novogorod,</hi> for the service of the Great
Duke.</p>
                     <p>The 29. we continu'd our Voyage,<note place="margin">The Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors came to <hi>Novogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod.</hi>
                        </note> and came to <hi>Novogorod,</hi> within a league of which we
met with some of our retinue, whom we had sent away from <hi>Riga,</hi> and who had expected us
for several moneths with much impatience. They met us in a Boat, and express'd much joy at
our arrival. The <hi>Weywode</hi> sent to our Inn, one Tun of Beer, another of Hydromel, and a
Barrel of Aquavitae; and we sent him a silver Cup, Vermilion gilt. We left <hi>Novogorod</hi> the
the 13. of <hi>Iuly,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Brunits.</note> and went 4 leagues farther by water, to <hi>Brunits,</hi> whence we finish'd our
Journey by Land.</p>
                     <p>As we were dis-embarking our Baggage at <hi>Brunits, August</hi> 1.<note place="margin">AUGUS.</note> came to the River side a <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi>
Procession,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>A</hi> Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</hi>
                        </note> to bless the water thereof. In the first place march'd two men, one carrying
a Cross, having at the four corners the four Evangelists; the other, an old Image, painted,
and cover'd with a clean linnen cloath. After them came a Priest pontifically vested, holding in
his hands a wooden Cross, a good half foot wide, and singing in consort with a little Boy who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47786:17"/>
carried a Book after him. Then came the Country people with their Wives and Children,
those who were of age carrying a wax Candle. After all came one who seem'd to be the Clark
of the Parish, having ten Tapers fastned together, all lighted. The Priest being come to the
River side, spent half an hour or better in singing and reading: Then he took the wax Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
from the Clark, and extinguish'd them in the Water, in imitation of whom, the people
did the like with theirs. Then the Priest dipp'd his Cross three several times in the Water,
when he took it out letting it drop into a Basin destin'd for the preservation of that Water,
which they esteem'd most sacred. This Ceremony over, the Women put their Children, great
and small, into the Water, some with their shirts on, others naked. Those who needed not
the assistance of others leap'd in themselves. Nay some brought their Horses to drink, that they
might also participate of the vertue of that Holy Water. This done, the whole Procession re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to the Church, where the Priest, having given the people his benediction, dismiss'd
them.</p>
                     <p>About 4. afternoon, we got on Horse-back, after we had dispos'd our Baggage into 50.
Wagon,<note place="margin">Crasmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stansky.</note> and travell'd that day five leagues, to a Village nam'd <hi>Crasmistansky.</hi> The next,
<hi>August</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Gam Chresta.</note> we travell'd eight leagues, and came at night to <hi>Gam Chresta. Gam,</hi> among the
<hi>Muscovites,</hi> are those places where Travellers take fresh Horses.</p>
                     <p>The 3. we came to <hi>Iazelbitza,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jaselbitza.</note> a little Village which the Country people had forsaken. There
we met with this misfortune, that our Cook being gone two leagues further to provide our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
we could not come up to him, by reason of the badness of the way, so that we had a sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
night of it. We met that day with several Officers, who, upon the Peace concluded between
the <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Muscovites</hi> at <hi>Smolensko,</hi> had desired leave to go to their own Habitations.</p>
                     <p>The 4. we met at <hi>Simnogora,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Simnogora Wolsolk.</note> where are fresh Horses to be taken up, with Colonel <hi>Fuchs;</hi>
and the 6. at <hi>Wolsolk,</hi> with Colonel <hi>Charles.</hi> They both honour'd our Ambassadors with their
visits, which occasioning entertainments, begat also those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> excesses and disorders which ordinarily
attend them in <hi>Germany;</hi> in one whereof our Trumpetter mortally wounded one of our Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
without any injury done him by the other. We left the wounded person behind, and
gave money to those who were to look to him. The Trumpetter was kill'd afterwards, after he
had been entertain'd into the Great Dukes service, at our return from <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 5. we pass'd through a Village, which the Inhabitants had forsaken, to avoid quartering
the <hi>German</hi> Souldiers, who had been disbanded neer <hi>Moscou.</hi> We lodg'd at night in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
<hi>Columna.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Columna<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> In those parts, we found many great blue stones, which the Tyrant <hi>Iohn Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louits,</hi>
had caus'd to be taken out of the Sepulchres, when he took the City of <hi>Reuel,</hi> having
design'd them to be brought to <hi>Mosco;</hi> but news being come that he was dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaden
in the high-way, where they have remain'd ever since.</p>
                     <p>The 7.<note place="margin">Budeua.</note> we came <hi>Budeua,</hi> a Village also; but at our entrance into it, our Horses began to
wince, stand upon their hinder feet, and beat the ground, as if they had been bewitch'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we could not imagine what should be the cause, till that having alighted, we found them co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
all over with Bees, which were beginning to fall-upon us, and prosecuted their animosity
so far, as to force us to keep them off with our Cloaks, and other Garments, and to go and
take up our quarters in the Fields. We understood since, that it was a Stratageme of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
who had incens'd the Bees, purposely to prevent our lodging in the Village.</p>
                     <p>The 8. we came to a Stage where were fresh Horses,<note place="margin">Torsock.</note> and so to <hi>Torsock,</hi> a little Town situate
upon the descent of a Hill, not far from the High-way, fortified with Ramparts, and Bastions
of wood. Bread, Beer, and Hydromel were there excellent good. The Ambassadors caused
Huts to be made of boughs of Trees without the Town, where we Supp'd and Lodg'd that
night.</p>
                     <p>The 9. we passed over two Torrents, one neer <hi>Torsock,</hi> the other half a League from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edna.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tuere.</note>
We came at night to the Citie of <hi>Tuere,</hi> which is also on a Hill-side, as <hi>Torsock,</hi> but
somewhat bigger. These two places have each of them their <hi>Weywode,</hi> or Governour. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath its name from the River <hi>Tuere,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The River <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                        </note> which passes by it, as well as the <hi>Wolga,</hi> which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
its course from this City, through <hi>Muscovy</hi> and <hi>Tartary,</hi> disembogues its self above 600
<hi>German</hi> Leagues thence (which make above 1500 <hi>French</hi>) in the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. It is already
so broad in those quarters, that we were forc'd to make use of a Ferry-boat to cross it. We
were lodg'd the other side of the City, in the Suburbs. This was our last stage for fresh Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
till we came to <hi>Moscou.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>August</hi> 13.<note place="margin">Nichola Nachinski.</note> we came to a Village called <hi>Nichola Nachinski,</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Moscou,</hi>
whence our <hi>Pristaf</hi> dispatch'd an Express to give notice of our arrival.</p>
                     <p>The 14. the <hi>Pristaf,</hi> attended by his Interpreter and Secretary, came to Complement the
Ambassadors, giving them thanks for the kind treatment he had receiv'd from them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an Apology for the ill they might have receiv'd from him. We presented him with a Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
Gilt-Cup, and gave some ten or twelve Crowns among the rest. The same day, the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
sent by the <hi>Pristaf</hi> return'd from <hi>Moscou,</hi> and oblig'd us to prepare for our Entrance,
which we made the same day in the order following.</p>

                        <item>2. After them, <hi>Iacob Scheve,</hi> our Harbinger, <hi>Michael Cordes,</hi> Captain of the ship, and <hi>Iohn
Algueyer,</hi> Clark of the Kitchin, all three abreast.</item>
                        <item>3. Three led Horses, to be presented to the Great Duke; one, black, and two, dappled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grey.</item>

                        <item>9. The Ambassadors, attended each, by a Guard of four, with their Carabines, having on
their right hand, but a little distance, the <hi>Pristaf</hi> who had conducted them.</item>
                        <item>10. The six Pages, in two ranks.</item>
                        <item>11. A Coach with four grey Horses.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>Having march'd in this order, very slowly, till we came within half a League of the City,
we met ten Coureiers (or Messengers) who came one after another with full speed towards
us, to acquaint the <hi>Pristaf</hi> with the place, where they were whose Office it was to receive us;
with order, one while, to march on very slowly, another, to make more haste, to the end we
should be much about the same time with them at the place appointed for our reception. We
saw also several <hi>Muscovites;</hi> very well mounted and richly clad, who only rid at some distance
from us, and return'd having taken a view of us. Within a quarter of a League of the City,
we pass'd through a Body of above 4000 <hi>Muscovites,</hi> all excellently well mounted and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuously
clad. Most of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors retinue came also to meet us, but were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to come neer us, so that we could only salute them at a distance.</p>
                     <p>Within a Pistol shot thence we saw coming towards us, two <hi>Pristafs</hi> clad in coats of Purfled
Satin mounted on two gallant white Horses. Instead of Bridles, they had Chains of silver, whereof
the links were two inches broad, but no thicker than the back of a knife, and of such a compass
as that a man might thrust in his first into them, which made a strange noise as the Horses went
along. The Great Duke's Master of the Horse followed them, with twenty led Horses all
white, and was accompany'd by a great number of persons both a foot and a hors-back. When
the Ambassadors and <hi>Pristafs</hi> were alighted,<note place="margin">The recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</note> the antienter of the two uncover'd himself, and

Besolerski, Vdorski, Obdorski, Condinski, and of all the North, Lord of the Countries of Iveria,
Czaar of Kartalmski and Ingusinski, Prince of the Countries of Kabardinski, Cyrcaski, and Iorkski,
Lord and Soveraign of many other Seignenries,</hi> receives you, as great Ambassadors from the
Duke of <hi>Sleswick, Holstein, Stormarie</hi> and <hi>Ditmars,</hi> Count of <hi>Oldenbourg</hi> and <hi>Delmenhorst.</hi> He
grants you and the Gentlemen of your retinue the favour to make your entrance upon his own
Horses, and hath appointed us <hi>Pristafs</hi> to have a care of you, and so to furnish you with all things
necessary, during your aboad at <hi>Mosco.</hi> To which Complement when the Ambassador <hi>Crusius</hi>
had made answer, there were brought two very stately white Horses, with Saddles after the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
fashion, Embroider'd with Gold and Silver, with Footh-cloaths, and Harness suitable.</p>
                     <p>As soon as the Ambassadors were mounted, the <hi>Pristaf</hi> and Musketiers, who had conducted
us from the Frontiers, were drawn off. There were brought also ten other white Horses for
the chiefest of our retinue, with Saddles after the <hi>Muscovian</hi> fashion, of Cloath of Gold and
Purfled Satin.<note place="margin">The <hi>Pristafs</hi> take the vpper hand of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</note> The <hi>Pristafs</hi> took the Ambassadors between them, though in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> he is
thought to have the more honourable place, who hath the right hand free. After them march'd
the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Grooms of the stable, who had the coverings of their Saddles of Leopard-skins,
Cloath of Gold, and Scarlet. The Cavalry we had seen in the fields, and the other <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
came powring into the City with the Ambassadors, and accompany'd them to their
Lodgings,<note place="margin">Their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> within the white wall, in that quarter which is called <hi>Czarskigorod,</hi> that is to say,
the City of the <hi>Czaar.</hi> We had assign'd us two Citizens houses built of wood, the <hi>Pristaf</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this excuse, in the name of the Great Duke, that a fire having not only consum'd the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
house for the entertainment of Ambassadors, but also another great house appointed for
our Lodgings, we could not possibly be better accommodated for the present; And indeed, at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47786:18"/>
our entrance into the City, we had observed whole streets burnt down, the fire having been so
violent, that it had reduc'd to ashes above five thousand houses: insomuch that most of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
were forc'd to lodge in Tents and Huts.</p>
                     <p>Ere we had taken a view of our Lodging,<note place="margin">The Great Dukes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing present to the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors.</note> the presents from the Great Duke's Kitchin and
Cellar were brought us; <hi>viz.</hi> eight Sheep, thirty Capons and Pullets, great store of white and
brown bread, and 22 sorts of drinks, Wine, Beer, Hydromel and Aquavitae, all brought in
by 32 <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who marching all in a file made the shew so much the greater. This done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the doors of our Lodging were lock'd upon us,<note place="margin">They are under a Guard.</note> and a Guard of twelve Musketiers set, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all communication between us and the Inhabitants, till after the first Audience. The <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stafs</hi>
in the mean time fail'd not to visit us every day, to assure us of their readiness to serve us.
They had also left with us an Interpreter, to facilitate the service which the Musketiers were
oblig'd to do us in the buying of our Provisions and other things. This Interpreter was a <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covite</hi>
born, and had been taken prisoner by the <hi>Polanders;</hi> by which means he fell into the
hands of Prince <hi>Ianus Radzivil,</hi> who brought him to <hi>Leipsig,</hi> where he learnt the <hi>German</hi>
Tongue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 15. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> celebrated the Feast of our B. Lady's ascension, and the same day
ended a Fast they had begun the first of that moneth. The 17. was design'd for our first Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
but the Great Duke being gone out of the City to do his Devotions, we spent the day in
giving God our humble thanks for his happy conduct of us to the place for which our Embassy
was design'd. We caus'd <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be sung, with Musick, and our Minister to make a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
at which, as also at the Dinner which follow'd it, was present, by permission on of the
Great Duke, M. <hi>Balthazar Moucheron,</hi> who manag'd the Affairs of the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> at
<hi>Mosco,</hi> in the quality of Commissary. He told us, that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> thought our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
very handsome, and wondred much that <hi>Germany</hi> should have Princes able to send so
considerable an Embassy. They give all strange Princes the quality of <hi>Knez,</hi> though their <hi>Knez</hi>
are properly no more than what Gentlemen are with us, and, those excepted who have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
employments relating to the State, the rest have no great Estates, it may be, about 800.
or 1000 <hi>per annum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 18. The two <hi>Pristafs</hi> came to acquaint us that the Great Duke would give us publick
Audience the next day. They desir'd also, in the Chancellors name, a Catalogue of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
we were to make his Majesty. After Dinner, the younger <hi>Pristaf</hi> came to confirm the
notice they had given us in the morning, <hi>viz.</hi> that on the morrow we should have the honour
to kiss the Great Dukes hand. We ask'd him what the discharging of the great Guns the day
before meant, and the shooting we had seen out of our Windows in a great Meadow. He told
us, it was only to make tryal of some pieces which the Great Duke had lately order'd to be
cast. Others said, that they had been discharg'd, only to make it appear that the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
had not lost all their Artillery before <hi>Smolensco,</hi> as some would have had it believ'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 19. The <hi>Pristafs</hi> came to see whether we were ready for Audience; and having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
that our men had put on their best Cloaths, and that all was in readiness, they went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to give notice thereof at the Castle, whence were brought us the white Horses which
we had at our Entrance. About 9 of the Clock the <hi>Pristafs</hi> return'd to us, having their stript<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satin

A Clock, on which was represented, in painting, the Parable of the Prodigal Child.</p>
                     <p>A Walking-Staff, Vermilion Gilt, in which was a piece of Perspective.</p>
                     <p>A great Ebony Clock, in an Ebony Case, garnish'd with Silver.</p>
                     <p>Next went two Gentlemen of the Chamber, carrying up on high in the Air, the Credential
Letters from his Highness, one to the Great Duke, the other to the Patriarch his Majesties Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
His name was <hi>Philaretes Nikidits;</hi> He dy'd after our departure from <hi>Holstein,</hi>
but we were told it would not be amiss to make it known we had Letters of credence
for him.</p>
                     <p>Then follow'd the Ambassadors between the two <hi>Pristafs,</hi> having before them the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
on each side four Lacqueys, and behind them, the Pages.</p>
                     <p>It was, from our Lodging to the Castle a good quarter of a <hi>German</hi> league, there being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
2000 Strelits or Musketiers dispos'd on both sides of the street, to make us free passage
to the place of Audience. The streets, windows and houses tops were full of people, who were
come from all quarters of the City to see our Cavalcade. We march'd in very good order,
halting and advancing according to the orders, which the Courriers, who rid with full speed
from the Castle, brought our <hi>Pristafs;</hi> to the end we might come to the Hall of Audience,
just as the Great Duke were sate in his Throne.</p>
                     <p>Being come into the Castle-Court, we pass'd before the <hi>Posolsky Precase,</hi> or the Chancery
for strangers affairs, where we alighted. After the Officers, and Gentlemen, had taken their
places, to wit, the Steward, in the head of the Presents, and the Gentlemen, with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Officers, immediately before the Ambassadors, we were brought to Audience. The Hall
for Audience is on the right hand of the Cour: when there come any Ambassadors from <hi>Persia,
Turky,</hi> or <hi>Tartary,</hi> they are carried up a stone pair of stairs on the right hand; but in regard
we were Christians, we took the left hand, and were led through a vaulted Gallery, purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we might pass by a very fair Church, where they were then at service. Before we came
into the Hall, we saw, in a spacious vaulted appartment, abundance of people, and among
others many antient Men, venerable for their long snowy beards, whereof some sate, others
stood along the walls, all clad in long Coats of stript Satin, and Caps of Martins skins: they
told us they were his Majesties <hi>Goses,</hi> that is, his principal Merchants or Factors, who had
those habits out of the Great Dukes Wardrobe, that they might honour him in those kinds of
Ceremonies, conditionally they return'd them assoon as they were over.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadors being come to the door of the Antichamber, they met with two <hi>Bojares,</hi>
or Lords, clad in Coats of Purfled Satin, cover'd with an embroidery of great Pearls, who
were to receive them at their Entrance. They told them that his <hi>Czaarick</hi> Majesty did them, and
the Gentlemen of their retinue, the favour of admitting them into his Presence. The Presents
were stay'd in the Antichamber, and they conducted into the Hall the Ambassadors with the
Officers, Gentlemen, and Pages, there going before them <hi>Iohn Hermes,</hi> the Great Dukes
principal Interpreter. As soon as he had set his foot within the Hall; he saluted his Majesty
with a loud voice, wishing him all prosperity and long life, and acquainted him with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of the Ambassadors. The Hall was square, and vaulted, hang'd and floor'd with Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.
The roof was gilt, and had several Sacred Stories painted therein. The Great Duke's
Chair was opposite to the door, against the wall, rais'd from the floor three steps, having at
the four corners Pillars which were Vermilion Gilt, about three inches about, with each of
them, at the height of an ell and a half, an Imperial Eagle of Silver, near which the Canopy
or upper part of the Chair rested upon the same Pillars: besides which the said Chair had at the
four Corners as many little Turrets of the same stuff, having also, at the ends, Eagles, after
the same manner. We were told there was another Chair of State a-making, about which
were bestow'd 1600 Marks of Silver, and 120 ounces of Ducat-gold for the gilding, and that
it would amount to above 25000 Crowns. The designer of it was a <hi>German,</hi> born at <hi>Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi>
his name, <hi>Esay Zinkgraf</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Great Duke sate in his Chair, clad in a long Coat, embroider'd with Pearls, and beset
with all sorts of precious Stones. He had above his Cap, which was of Martins-skins, a
Crown of Gold, beset with great Diamonds, and in his right hand a Scepter of the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
and no less rich, and so weighty, that he was forc'd to relieve one hand with the other.
On both sides of his Majesties Chair stood young Lords, very handsome, both as to Face and
Body, clad in long Coats, of white Damask, with Caps of a Linx's skin, and white Buskins,
with Chains of Gold, which crossing upon the breast, reach'd down to their hips. They had
laid over their shoulders each a Silver Ax, whereto they put their hands, as if they had been
going to give their stroke. On the right side of the Chair, upon a Pyramid of Silver carv'd
thorough, stood the Imperial Apple, of massy Gold, representing the World, as big as a
Canon-bullet of 48 pound weight; and at a like distance, on the same side, a Basin and Ewer
and a Napkin, to wash and wipe the Great Dukes hands, after the Ambassadors and those of
their retinue had kiss'd them. The principal <hi>Bojares</hi> or Lords of the Court, to the number of
fifty, were all set upon Benches by the wall-side, on one side, and opposite to the Great
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47786:19"/>
Duke, very richly clad, with great Caps, of a black Fox furr, a good quarter of an ell high.
The Chancellor stood on the right hand, some five paces from the chair.</p>
                     <p>They having made a low reverence at their Entrance,<note place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> were plac'd in the midst of the
Hall opposite to the Great Duke, and about ten paces from him, having behind them the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Gentlemen of their retinue, on the right, the two Gentlemen who carry'd the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Letters, which they held before them, and on the left, the Interpreter <hi>Iohn Helmes.</hi>
This done, the Great Duke made a sign to the Chancellor, that he should tell the Ambassadors,
that his Majesty granted them the favour to do him reverence. The<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ambassadors went one after
another, and kiss'd his right hand, which he very gracefully reach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d to them, and with a smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
countenance, taking the Scepter in the mean time in his left hand. Now it is to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that in these ceremonies, he who kisses the Great Dukes hand is not to touch it with his
own, and that only the Ambassadors of Christian Princes have the honour to kiss it, which
the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> much less the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> have not.</p>
                     <p>This Ceremony ended, he caus'd the Chancellor to tell them, that if they had ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
from their Prince, they might do it. Whereupon the Ambassador <hi>Crusius</hi> made him a
complement from the Duke our Master, and his condoleances for the death of the Patriarch his
Father, adding, that his Highness hoping we should have found him living, had given them
Letters of Credence for him, and that they had brought them along with those his Highness
writ to his Majesty. Whereupon he took the Letters from those that held them, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
to deliver them; but the Great Duke made a sign to the Chancellor to take
them, and having commanded him to come to him, he whisper'd in his ear the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
he would make the Ambassadors. The Chancellor being return'd to his place, said,
<hi>The Grand Seigneur Czaar,</hi> and <hi>Great Duke, &amp;c.</hi> tells thee, <hi>Philip Crusius,</hi> and thee, <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Brugman,</hi> Ambassadors from the Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> that he hath received the Letters of his
Highness, that he will order them to be translated, and he will acquaint you with his intention
by his <hi>Bojares,</hi> and that he will make answer thereto. The Chancellor, who had not unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
himself, no more than the other Lords, took off his Cap when he pronounc'd the name
of his Majesty, or that of his Highness of <hi>Holstein.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This done, The Ambassadors were seated on a Bench cover'd with a <hi>Turkie</hi> Carpet, which
was set behing them, and the Chancellor told them, that the Great Duke was pleas'd that
their Officers and Gentlemen should have the honour of kissing his hand. Which done, the
Great Duke rais'd himself up a little in his Chair, and said to the Ambassadors, <hi>Knez Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric
jescha sdorof?</hi> Is Duke <hi>Frederick</hi> in good health? Whereto it was answer'd, that at our
departure we had left him very well, <hi>God grant a good life and a long, and all happiness to his
Majesty and Highness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then was brought in a List of the Presents, which were sent in with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and stood some time
before the Great Duke, till the Chancellor ordered them to be taken away. The said Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
presently after told the Ambassadors, that the <hi>Czaar and Great Duke of all the Russians,
Lord and Soveraign of many Seignories, &amp;c.</hi> was further pleas'd they should speak of their
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>airs; but they desir'd, that, to avoid doing any thing prejudicial to the Treatise made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Crown of <hi>Sueden</hi> and his Highness, concerning the Commerce of <hi>Persia,</hi> they might
have a private Audience together; which was accordingly granted. After this, the Great Duke
caus'd them to be asked, whether they were in health, and whether they wanted any thing, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them notice, that that day he would do them the favour to treat them with meat from his
own Table. This was the first publick Audience the Ambassadors had. They were brought
back to the Antichamber by the same <hi>Bojares</hi> who had receiv'd them at their en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rance. We
mounted at the same place where we alighted, and return'd to our Lodgings, accompany'd by
our <hi>Pristafs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Grand Duke treats the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</note> in the same order as we had gone thence. We were hardly alighted ere there came
in one of the Gentlemen of the Great Duke's Chamber. He was of the quality of the <hi>Knez,</hi> to
which his countenance and behaviour was suitable, being of great stature, magnificently clad,
excellently well mounted and attended, and had been sent by the Great Duke, to treat the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
at Dinner. Assoon as he was come in, he caus'd the cloath to be laid, on which were
in the first place set, a Salt-seller, and two Vinegar-dishes of Silver, and certain drinking-cups,
whereof three were of Gold, and two others of Silver, and so big, that they were above a foot
diameter, a great Knife and some Forks. This Lord, seating himself at the end of the Table,
ordered the Ambassadors to sit down by him, the Gentlemen standing before them. He caus'd
to be set on the Table before the Ambassadors three great vessels full of Sack, Rhenish-Wine,
and Hydromel, and caus'd the meat to be serv'd out, on 38. great Silver Dishes, which consisted
in boil'd, rosted and pastry. All being serv'd, the <hi>Knez</hi> rise, caus'd the Ambassadors to come
before the Table, and told them, there was the Provision which the <hi>Czaar</hi> had commanded him
to entertain them withall, praying them to be pleas'd with the treatment. Then he took the
great Cup, which he caus'd to be fill'd with excellent good Hydromel, made with Raspices
and having drunk his Majesties health, he caus'd as much to be given the Ambassadors, and all
their retinue, obliging us to drink the Great Duke's health all at the same time. Some of us
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47786:20"/>
would have reach'd their arms over the Table, to take the Gobelet, but the <hi>Muscovite</hi> would
not suffer it, saying, that Table then represented the Great Duke's, who permits none to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
his Table, and so oblig'd them to come round about and take the Cup. This health was
follow'd by that of our Prince, which he began to the Ambassadors, saying, <hi>God grant health
and prosperity to his Highness, and make him long to continue in a good correspondence and amity
with his Majesty.</hi> The third health was that of the Prince, the Great Duke's son. This done,
they sate to the Table, and some Gobelets of a Wine made of Cherries and Mulberries were
drunk about. The Ambassadors presented him with a Vermilion-gilt cup, of the weight of
three Marks and a half, which he caus'd to be carried before him, as he return'd to the Castle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 20. The <hi>Pristafs</hi> came to tell us, that the Great Duke was pleas'd we should go
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and gave us the liberty to walk about the City, and to that end Horses should be
brought us from his own stables, when ere we should desire it. We were also permitted to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors, and to receive their Visits. All which were thought so great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> themselves were astonish'd at it; for till then it had not been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,
that the Domesticks of strange Ambassadors should walk about the City, but, when their
occasions oblig'd them to go abroad, they were accompany'd by one or more of the Musketiers.
Two dayes after, the <hi>Pristaf</hi> accompany'd by a Groom of the Great Duke's stables, brought
us six horses, and conducted us to the Lodgings of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors, whom we saw se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times after, and held a very fair correspondence with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 23. The Ambassadors would have invited to Dinner Dr. <hi>Wendelin,</hi> the Physician, the
Apothecary, and some other servants of the Great Duke; but the Chancellor would not suffer
them to come, and forbad them seeing us for three dayes; of which rigorous treatment we could
have no accompt, till afterwards, that we were told, it was, because, the Presents had not yet
been valu'd, among which was the Cabinet made like an Apothecaries shop, we spoke of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which could not be valu'd but by them.</p>
                     <p>The 24. Came before <hi>Moscou Arnald Spirin,</hi> Farmer General of the Customs in <hi>Livonia,</hi>
through which he had pass'd, and was sent by the Crown of <hi>Sueden</hi> to be present at the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
which the Ambassadors thence were to manage for Commerce, wherein he was very
well vers'd. The <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who knew him, made some difficulty to entertain him in that
quality; but perceiving the <hi>Suedes</hi> took it ill, they were at last content to do it, and sent a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staf</hi>
to meet and receive him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>September</hi> 1.<note place="margin">SEPTEM.</note> The <hi>Muscovites</hi> celebrated the first day of their New year;<note place="margin">The <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> New-years day.</note> for having no other
Epoche than that of the Creation of the World, which they believe to have been in Autumn,
they begin the year with the Moneth of <hi>September,</hi> and they accompted then 7142 years, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the Eastern Church, which count 5508. from the
Creation of the World to the birth of Christ; whereto add 1634. you will find the number
7142. whereas we accompt from the Creation of the World to the same year 1634. but 5603
years. Their Procession was hand som enough, consisting of above 20000 persons, of all ages,
who were admitted into the outer Court of the Castle. The Patriarch, attended by almost
400 Priests, all Pontifically habited, and carrying a many Banners, Images, and old Books
open, came out of the Church, which is on the right hand of the second Court, while the
Great Duke came out on the left hand of the same Court, accompany'd by his Councellours of
State, <hi>Knez,</hi> and <hi>Bojares.</hi> The Great Duke and the Patriarch advanc'd one towards the other,
and kiss'd, the Duke having his Cap in his hand; and the Patriarch, who had a Mitre on his
head, held in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

precious stones, which he presented to the Great Duke to kiss. That done, the Patriarch gave
his Majesty his Benediction, as also to all the people, wishing them all prosperity in the New
year. There were many <hi>Muscovitis</hi> who held their Petitions in the air, and, their way of
presenting them to the Great Duke, was, to cast them with no small noise at his feet, whence
certain Officers gather'd them up, to be carried to his Majesties chamber, that they might be
answer'd. This done, the Processions parted, and return'd to the place from whence
they came.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sept. 3. Gillenstiern, Bureus,</hi> and <hi>Spiring,</hi> who were to Negotiate joyntly with us concerning
the Passage into <hi>Persia,</hi> were conducted to their publick audience, with the same Ceremonies
as we had been, while the two other <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors, Mr. <hi>Philip Scheiding,</hi> and Col.
<hi>Henry Fleming</hi> were to treat in private, of the difference which were between the Crown of
<hi>Sueden</hi> and the Great Duke. The Three former desired in their audience to be receiv'd joyntly
with us, to treat with those whom it should please his Majesty to appoint for that purpose:
which was granted.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon, all the Ambassadors, as well the <hi>Suedish</hi> as ours, went the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the Castle.
They were at first conducted into a spacious appartment, on the left hand, where they found
the same <hi>Goses,</hi> or Merchants, and in the same habits, as we had seen at our first Audience.
Thence they went into a Hall, where the four Commissioners appointed to treat with us, were
sate at a Table expecting us. They were, two <hi>Bojares,</hi> and two Chancellors, or Secretaries
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47786:20"/>
of State, very richly clad, having Coats of stript Satin, embroidered with very great Perls and
other precious stones, and great Golden Chains which made a Cross upon their breasts. The
<hi>Bojares</hi> had Caps, after the fashion of calotts, beset with Perls, having in the midst a clustre of
Diamonds and precious Stones. The other two had their Caps of black-fox fur, according to
the ordinary fashion. They receiv'd the Ambassadors very civilly, and intreated them to sit
down by them; but with all their civility they took up the best places themselves, at one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Hall, where the benches joyn'd. The Ambassadors took up theirs neer them against
the Wall; and there was brought a seat without any back, for the Chancellors or Secretaries of
State, opposite to the others. <hi>Iohn Helmes,</hi> the Great Duke's chief Interpreter, stood among
our <hi>Pristafs,</hi> and all the Gentlemen, with all the rest of our retinue, stay'd in the Antichamber,
except only the two Secretaries of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassy and ours, as many Interpreters, and a
<hi>Muscovite</hi> Clark, who was taken in to take notes of what was treated of. All having taken
their places, one of the <hi>Bojares</hi> ask'd the Ambassadors, whether they were supply'd with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
provisions, or wanted any thing? The Ambassadors made answer, that they had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
rather to commend those who had the management thereof, and that they gave his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
their most humble thanks for his care of them. After this complement, all rise up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uncover'd, the more considerable of the two <hi>Bojares,</hi> said, <hi>The Grand Seigneur Czaar and
Great Duke</hi> (reciting all his Titles, and being all sat down again, he went on) gives you to
understand, you Lords Ambassadors from the Crown of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> that he
hath caus'd your Letters to be translated into the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Language, and that he hath also
hearkned to the Propositions you made to him, at the publick audience he gave you. Upon that
they all rose again, and the other <hi>Bojare,</hi> uncovering himself, said, <hi>The Grand Seigneur, Czaar
and Great Duke,</hi> &amp;c. (not omitting any of the former titles, and so sitting down, continued)
wishes the Queen of <hi>Sueden</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> all prosperity, and victory over their
Enemies, and tells you, that he hath read their Letters, and that he well understands their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
The third Commissioner proceeded with the same Ceremonies, saying <hi>The Grand
Seigneur,</hi> &amp;c. hath seen the Letters you have brought him, is satisfy'd, that all credence is to
be given you in what you shall say and propose, which shall accordingly be done. To which
the fourth added, That his Majesty, the <hi>Czaar,</hi> had appointed them Commissioners, to receive
from them, what they had to propose and desire; and thereupon read the names of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
who were:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>Knez Boris Michaelouits, Likow Obolenscoi, <hi>Weywode of</hi> Tuere</item>
                        <item>Knez Vasili Iuanouits Stresnow, <hi>Weywode of</hi> Tarschock</item>
                        <item>The two Secretaries of State, whom they call <hi>Dumnoi Diaken,</hi> were,</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Iuan Tarascouits Granmatin,</hi> Lord Keeper of the Seals or Chancellor, &amp;c.</item>
                        <item>Iuan Offonassiowsin Gauaarenow, <hi>Vicechancellor.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>This done, they all rise, and one of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors, <hi>Eric Gillenstierna,</hi> having given
his Majesty thanks on the behalf of his Mistriss, for their admission to a private audience, read to
the Commissioners their proposition, contained in one sheet of paper, written in the the <hi>German</hi>
tongue. We would have done the like with ours; but being larger than the other, to forbear
importuning the Commissioners, we thought it enough to put it in with that of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.
The Commissioners, having receiv'd them, went up to the Great Duke's Chamber,
to communicate them to him, leaving us alone, save that the <hi>Pristafs</hi> and Gentlemen of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
were permitted to come into the room to entertain us. Having expected a good half-hour,
the Vice-chancellor came down to tell us, that we should have no other answer at that time, than
that his Majesty would cause the propositions to be translated, and would let us know his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
with the soonest.</p>

of a very coarse red cloath; but at their return from audience, they were in Damask coats, some
red, some yellow, which the Great Duke had bestow'd on them by way of present. There
hardly passes a year, but these Gentlemen, as well as the other Tartars their Neighbours, send
such an Ambassy to <hi>Moscou;</hi> not so much for any business they have, as to get some Furs,
Martins skins, and silk Vestments.</p>
                     <p>The 15. Our <hi>Pristafs</hi> came to tell us, that the Great Dutchess was, the day before, deliver'd
of a Daughter, who was already Christned, and nam'd <hi>Sophia,</hi> according to the custom of the
<hi>Muscovites,</hi> who baptize their Children immediately after their birth, and without any Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
or entertainments, as they do in other Countreys. The Patriarch was her God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
as he had been to all the rest of the Great Duke's Children, who would nevertheless
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47786:21"/>
have us to participate of that joy, upon which accompt, our ordinary allowance was
doubled.</p>

                              </gap>urkish</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</note> who was receiv'd with great Ceremonies; and
though they sent 16000 Horse to meet him, yet in all that Army there were seen but six Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
The first, which was that of the Duke's Guard, was of white Satin, and had in the
midst, within a circle of Laurel, an Imperial Eagle with a triple Crown, with this Motto,
<hi>Virtute Supero.</hi> One of Crimson Damask branch'd, having in the midst a <hi>Ianus</hi> with two
faces. One of a plain red Damask; and the other three, blew and white, whereof one had a
Gryffon, another, a Snail; the third, a naked Arm coming out of the Clouds, and holding a
sword. 'Tis thought these were the devises of the <hi>German</hi> officers, during the War at <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensco.</hi>
Every Colours was attended by Timbrels and Hautbois, but the white had six Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
which made a wretched inharmonious noise. The <hi>Knez</hi> and Lords that were sent to meet
this Ambassadors, were excellently well mounted, upon Horses that came out of <hi>Persia, Poland,</hi>
and <hi>Germany,</hi> very richly set out, having with them out of the Great Dukes Stable, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
led Horses, with great silver Chains instead of Bridles, such as we have mention'd
before.</p>
                     <p>We, with the Gentlemen and Officers of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Officers retinue, made up a Troop of
fifty Horse, under the command of <hi>Wolfwolf Spar,</hi> Gentleman of the Horse to the <hi>Suedish</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy,
who, as our Captain, march'd in the head of the Troop. We went a good league to
meet the Ambassador, who no sooner perceiv'd us, but he look'd very earnestly upon us, and
we upon him. We kept along with him a good while, to take the better notice of his retinue,
and Cavalcade, which march'd in the order following.</p>
                     <p>First, march'd 46 Strelits, having, instead of Muskets, Bows and Arrows, and Cimitars
by their sides. After them came a <hi>Pristaf</hi> clad in a Coat of Brocado, and follow'd by eleven
Men, clad in Red Branched Velvet, whereof some were <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Turkish</hi> Merchants, some
<hi>Greek</hi> Ecclesiasticks. After them march'd the Ambassador's Steward, alone, and behind him
a Gua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d of four, with Bows and Arrows. After them two Cavalliers very richly clad, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
preceding the Ambassador, who march'd alone. He was a middle-statur'd Man,
much tann'd in the face, his Beard very black: His under-coat was of a White-Flowr'd Satin,
and his upper Garment of Satin purfled with Gold, lined with Martins-skins. His Turbant
was white, as were also those of his retinue. He was in a sorry Wagon, of a white kind of
Wood, but all cover'd with rich Tapestry. The rest of his Train consisted in above forty Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
of Baggage, which were every one kept by one or two Boys. Being come within a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a league of the City, near, as he imagin'd, the place where the <hi>Muscovites</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, he mounted an excellent <hi>Arabian</hi> Horse. Nor indeed had he rode a Pistol-shot, ere
he met the two <hi>Pristafs</hi> appointed for his reception, with the Great Duke's Horses, according
to the custom. The <hi>Pristafs</hi> continued on Horsback, till the Ambassador had alighted; but
he, on the other side, stirr'd not his Turbant, though the <hi>Muscovites</hi> took off their Caps,
when they pronounc'd the Great Duks name.</p>
                     <p>After this first Complement, the <hi>Pristafs</hi> immediately mounted; the Ambassadour did what
he could to be in the Saddle as soon as they, or sooner; but they had brought him a very high
Horse (with a Saddle yet much higher, according to the <hi>Muscovian</hi> fashion) and so skittish
withal, that he not only found some difficulty to get up, but very narrowly scap'd being hurt
by him. Being got up, the <hi>Pristafs</hi> took him between them, and conducted him to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
place for the entertainment of Ambassadors, which had been built up since our coming
thither. As soon as he was got in, the doors were shut, and several Guards of Musketiers
plac'd about it.</p>
                     <p>Our Ambassadors intended to have gone that day to those of <hi>Sueden,</hi> who had invited them
to dinner, to shew them the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were lodg'd near them, the <hi>Suedes</hi> having a prospect
into their Court: but the Chancellor sent to desire us not to stir abroad that day, for reasons
he could not discover.</p>
                     <p>The 19. We had the second private Audience with the <hi>suedish</hi> Ambassadors.</p>
                     <p>The 23. The <hi>Turkish</hi> Ambassadour had his first publick Audience,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors first audience.</note> to which he went
in this order.</p>
                     <p>In the Front march'd 20 <hi>Cosaques,</hi> mounted on white Horses, out of the Great Duke's stables:
after them, the <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Merchants; and then the Presents, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Twenty pieces of Satin stript with Gold, carried by so many <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who march'd all
in a file.</p>
                     <p>A Golden Cross, about a fingers length, beset with several large Diamonds, carried by a
<hi>Muscovite</hi> in a Basin.</p>
                     <p>A Vessel of Rock-Chrystal, adorn'd with Gold, and enrich'd with precious Stones.</p>

                     <p>A Pearl of great bigness, laid on a piece of water'd Taffata, in a Basin.</p>
                     <p>Harness for two Horses, embroider'd with Gold, and set with Pearls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47786:21"/>
A very fair Diamond-ring, in a Basin.</p>
                     <p>A Ruby, as big as a Crown piece of Silver, enchac'd in Gold, in a Basin.</p>
                     <p>A very fair Battel-Ax, which they call <hi>Bulaf,</hi> form'd like a Scepter.</p>
                     <p>After the Presents march'd eight <hi>Turks,</hi> two a-breast, and after them, two very handsome
young men, carrying upon great pieces of silk, the Credential Letters, which though folded,
were yet at least half an ell wide. The <hi>Greek</hi> Ecclesiasticks were not in the Cavalcade, but had
their Audience by themselves the 28. following. Two <hi>Muscovy</hi> Priests went to them at their
Lodgings, and conducted them to the Castle, where they met a great number of Priests, who
accompany'd them to their audience. Their presents were;</p>
                     <p>Six Basins with Relicks, or a parcel of Bones, whereof some were gilt.</p>
                     <p>Linings for a Priest's Cope, embroider'd with Gold and Perls.</p>
                     <p>A Head-stall for a Horse, beset with precious Stones.</p>
                     <p>Two pieces of Satin purfled with Gold.</p>
                     <p>One Priest's Cope.</p>
                     <p>One piece of silver'd Taby, with flowers of Gold.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> march'd after the Presents, clad in Violet Chamlet, and had a Cross carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them.</p>
                     <p>Our Ambassadors had also Letters from the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> to the Great Duke, and
thought fit to deliver them at a Publick Audience, for which was appointed St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s day,
<hi>Sept.</hi> 29. We went in the same order as the time before, and the Letters were carried M.
<hi>Vchterits</hi> upon black and yellow <hi>Taffata,</hi> which are the Elector's Colours. The Great Duke
receiv'd them with much kindness, enquir'd after the health of his Electoral Highness, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
we should once more be furnish'd with meat from his own Table; which indeed was
brought us, not ready dress'd as the former, but we were left to order it as we would our
selves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>October</hi> 1. the <hi>Muscovites</hi> keep as one of their most solemn Festivals,<note place="margin">OCTOB. <hi>A</hi> Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian <hi>Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.</hi>
                        </note> or <hi>Prasnick:</hi> the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
these. The Great Duke attended by the whole Court, and the Patriarch, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
by all the Clergy, went in Procession to the Church which is in the outer Court of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
called by the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> that of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> by the <hi>Germans, Ierusalem.</hi> But
before they went into it, they turn'd aside to a place balcony'd about much after the form of a
Theatre, on the right hand as you go to the Church, neer which place are two great pieces of
Canon, whereof the bore is at least half an ell diameter. The Great Duke and the Patriarch,
being got into it, not admitting any other, the Patriarch presented to his Majesty an Image
painted upon a piece of past-board, which folded as it had been a book, enrich'd with silver in
the middle, and at the four corners, to which Image the <hi>Czaar</hi> made a most low reverence, and
touch'd it with his fore-head, the Priests in the mean time muttering over their Prayers. Which
done, the Patriarch approaching the Great Duke again, presented him, to kiss it, a Golden
Cross, of about a foot length, beset with Diamonds. He also touch'd his forehead and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
with it: whereupon they all went into the Church, where they concluded the service.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> that came along with the <hi>Turkish</hi> Ambassador, went in also, by a priviledge par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
to them, of all Christians, whom the <hi>Muscovites</hi> suffer not to enter their Churches; but
they permit the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as such as profess the same Religion with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Octob.</hi> 8. we had our third private Audience, with the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors, and were above
two hours in conference with the Great Duke's Ministers.</p>
                     <p>The 12. the Great Duke went on Pilgrimage,<note place="margin">The Great Duke goes a Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</note> to a Church half a league from the City. He
rode alone on horseback, with a whip in his hand, and was follow'd by above 1000. horse.
The <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojares</hi> who attended him, march'd ten a-breast, which made a noble show, and
express'd the greatness of the Prince. The Great Dutchess, with the young Prince and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
followed them in a large Chariot, all of Joyners work, cover'd with Scarlet, the curtains
of yellow Taffata, drawn by sixteen white horses. After the Dutchess's, the Court-Ladies
were carried in 22. other Chariots, of wood, painted green, covered with Scarlet, the curtains
drawn close, so that those within could not be seen. I had the happiness, the wind having
blown those of the Great Dutchess, a little on one side, to have a glimps of her, and I thought
her very handsome, and very richly clad. On both sides march'd above a hundred <hi>Strelits,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
white tlaves in their hands, to keep off the people, who were thronging to bless their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
for whom the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have a particular respect and devotion.</p>
                     <p>The 23. we had, with the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassadors, our fourth private Audience, wherein we
concluded our Negotiation, The 28. the <hi>Suedish</hi> had their last publick Audience in order to
their departure, returning from which, they caus'd the Answer to their Letters, to be carried
by two Gentlemen. The 7. and 10. of <hi>November</hi> they departed from <hi>Mosco,</hi> in three troops,
some taking the way of <hi>Livonia,</hi> others that of <hi>Sueden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nov.</hi> 19. we had our fifth and last private Audience,<note place="margin">NOVEM.</note> at which it was told us, that
his <hi>Czaarick</hi> Majesty, having taken our propositions into serious consideration, had at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to gratifie his Highness the Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> as his Friend, Uncle, and Ally, as to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47786:22"/>
what he had desir'd of him, and to grant him, what he had deny'd many other Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
of <hi>Europe,</hi> to wit, a passage through <hi>Muscovy</hi> to go into <hi>Persia,</hi> and that his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors

bring him the ratification of the present Treaty.</p>
                     <p>Having so happily, though with much difficulty, perfected our negotiation, we thought it
not amiss, to divert our selves, for some days, among our friends; as we did at the Christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a Child of the Residents of <hi>Sueden,</hi> at a feast which Dr. <hi>Wendelin</hi> made, at the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of a Kinsman of his, and at the magnificent entertainment which <hi>David Ruts,</hi> one of the
chiefest Dutch Merchants there, gave us at his own house.</p>
                     <p>The 22. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> made a solemn Procession to a Church, near the ordinary place
where the Ambassadors are entertain'd, at which the Great Duke and the Patriarch were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
There was a passage made with Deal-boards, from the Castle to the Church, along
which came first several pedling Merchants, who sold wax Candles; after them, some that
swept the passage and kept it clean. The Procession was thus.</p>
                     <p>First, went a man carrying an Ewer, and a Napkin.</p>
                     <p>Three men carrying Banners, like Cornet's Colours, half Red, half White.</p>
                     <p>Sixty one Priests, in their Copes.</p>
                     <p>Four Cherubins carried upon long poles.</p>
                     <p>A man carrying a Lantern at the top of a long pole.</p>
                     <p>Forty Priests.</p>
                     <p>Eight Priests, carrying a great Cross, fasten'd in a great piece of timber, double-cross'd.</p>
                     <p>A hundred Priests and Monks, carrying every one a painted Image.</p>
                     <p>A great Image cover'd, carried by two men.</p>
                     <p>Forty Priests.</p>
                     <p>A great Image, adorn'd with abundance of precious Stones, carried by three men.</p>
                     <p>Another lesser Image.</p>
                     <p>Four Priests singing.</p>
                     <p>Another Image.</p>
                     <p>A Cross of Diamonds, in a Basin.</p>
                     <p>Two men, carrying each a lighted Taper.</p>
                     <p>The Patriarch, in Pontificalibus, very richly clad, under a blew Canopy, and led by

                     <p>The Great Duke under a red Canopy, supported by two Lords of his Counsel, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

                     <p>His S'edge, drawn by two white Horses.</p>
                     <p>This Procession was occasion'd upon the finding of an Image of our Lady's in a certain place,
where, since, there is a Church built.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>December</hi> 12. We saw a Cavalcade of seventy two <hi>Crim-Tartars,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade of <hi>Crim-Tartars.</hi>
                        </note> who all took the quality
of <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> and were going to have Audience, which the Great Duke gave them, and
whereat he had the patience to endure them for the space of three hours. Being come into the
Hall of Audience, some sate on the ground, others lay along, and there was given every one
a Gobelet of Hydromel; to the two Chief of the Embassy, Garments of Brocado, to others
of Scarlet, and to the most inconsiderable among them, Cloaths of some more common Stuff,
with some Furrs, and Caps of Martins-skins, which they had upon their other cloaths, as
they return'd from Audience. 'Tis a Nation absolutely barbarous and dreadful to look on.
Though they are at a great distance from <hi>Muscon,</hi> towards the South, yet they do the
Great Duke abundance of mischief by their incursions, and the robberies they incessantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
upon his Subjects. The <hi>Czaar, Faedor Iuanouits,</hi> the present Great Duke's Father, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to prevent their incursions, by causing the Woods to be cut down, and by means of
a Causway and a Moat, which he had caus'd to be drawn a hundred leagues together, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their entrance into his Country: but they never rested till they had pull'd down one, and
fill'd the other; so that, to keep them at home, the Great Duke is oblig'd from time to time,
to suffer these Embassies, the design whereof is only to get Presents, whereof the expence
would not trouble the Great Duke, if they would keep the Barbarians quiet, but they continue
in peace but till they perceive they can make any advantage by the breach of it.</p>
                     <p>The 16. we had Audience,<note place="margin">The Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors have their last Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> in order to our departure, to which we were conducted with the

great Lords to make use of horses, they sent us two sumptuous Sledges, whereof one was
lin'd with a Crimson water'd Satin, the other, with Damask of the same colour. There were
within them some white Bears-skins, and over head rich <hi>Turkie</hi> Tapistry, to serve for a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47786:22"/>
The Buckles of the Harness were cover'd of all sides with Fox-tailes, which is the richest
Ornament, that the Great Lords, nay indeed the Great Duke himself, can make use of. The
<hi>Pristafs</hi> had each his Sledge, and went on the right hand of the Ambassadors. At our alighting,
we were receiv'd by two <hi>Bojares,</hi> after the accustomed manner. As soon as the Ambassadors
were come into the Great Duke's presence, and that the Chancellor had given him an account of
their health, a seat was brought, and they were intreated to sit down. Whereupon the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
said, <hi>The Grand Seigneur, Czaar, and Great Duke,</hi> Michael Federouits, <hi>Conservator of

immediately receive his Majesties answer, both to Duke <hi>Frederick,</hi> of <hi>Holstein,</hi> and to the
Elector <hi>Iohn-George.</hi> Whererpon he deliver'd them the Letters before the Great Duke's Chair,
and the Ambassadors having receiv'd them with much respect, the Great Duke said, <hi>When the

<hi>and his Highness, Duke</hi> Frederick <hi>of</hi> Holstein, <hi>they will salute them from me.</hi> Which done, they
were told by the Chancellor, that his Majesty was pleas'd to grant the Ambassadors, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and Officers of their retinue, the favour of kissing his hand once more.</p>
                     <p>That done, they told us, we should have meat sent from the Great Duke's own Table. The
Ambassadors gave the <hi>Czaar</hi> thanks for all the favours they had receiv'd from him, wishing his
Majesty long life and a happy Government, and, to the whole house of the <hi>Czaar</hi> all prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Having taken their leaves, they return'd to their quarters. About an hour after, the meat
from the Great Duke's Table was brought, in forty six dishes, most fish, boyl'd, broyl'd, and
fry'd in Oyl, some Sallets and Pastry; but no flesh, by reason of the Fast which the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
very rigorously observe before Christmas. <hi>Knez Iuan Wolf,</hi> came along with them, to treat
us, with the same ceremonies as we were treated with at our first publick audience. After Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
we were visited by the Groom of the Stables, the Butler, and the Pourveyer, who came to
demand their Presents. The <hi>Knez,</hi> the Groom, and the Butler, had each of them a drinking
Cup of Vermilion-gilt. The rest, who were about sixteen, had bestow'd among them 32. Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which amount to about 64. French Crowns.</p>
                     <p>The next day, the two <hi>Pristafs,</hi> accompany'd by their Interpreters, <hi>Iohn Helmes,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
Angler,</hi> of whom the former had serv'd us in our Negotiation, with the Great Duke and
the <hi>Bojares,</hi> the other, in our private affairs, came to ask us how many Horses we should stand
in need of for our return. We demanded 80. and presented each of them with a large drinking
Cup, of Vermilion-gilt. We did the like to the chief Secretary of the Chancery, and some of
the great Lords.</p>
                     <p>The 21. Our <hi>Pristafs</hi> presented to us another <hi>Pristaf,</hi> named <hi>Bogidan Tzergeuits Gomodof,</hi>
who had orders to conduct us to the Frontiers of <hi>Sueden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next day were brought us the Horses appointed for our journey, and at the same time
came, with one of our <hi>Pristafs,</hi> the Lord Treasurers Secretary, accompany'd by 12. <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
loaden with Martins-skins,<note place="margin">The <hi>Czaar's</hi> present.</note> to be presented, from the Great Duke, to the Ambassadors,
and those of their retinue. The Ambassadors had for their shares eleven Zimmers (every Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
makes twenty pair) of the best kind of Sables; The Officers, Gentlemen, Pages, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger,
the Clerk of the Kitchin, and the Master of the Wagons, had each a Zimmer of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins-skins.
The rest had some two, some but one pair. We gave the Secretary a drinking Cup,
of Vermilion-gilt, and to the rest 30 Crowns. The Great Duke sent also to tell us, that if we
would make a little longer stay at <hi>Moscou,</hi> by reason of the approaching Festivals of Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
and the cold weather, which indeed was to extremity, he should take it kindly, and,
though we had our dispatches, yet should we be furnish'd with the ordinary provisions; but
the desire we had to return into <hi>Germany,</hi> would not permit us to accept of his favour, so that
we put all things in readiness for our journey. To that end, we bought Sledges, that we might
travel with more convenience; they standing us in but three or four Crowns apiece. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
we were to travel into <hi>Persia,</hi> having obtain'd the Great Dukes permission to do it, it was
thought fit, that <hi>Michael Cordes,</hi> with six other persons of our retinue, should be sent to
<hi>Nisa,</hi> which is a hundred Leagues from <hi>Moscou,</hi> there to order the building of such ships as
we should stand in need of, as well upon the River <hi>Wolga,</hi> as the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea.</p>

                        <hi>Decemb.</hi> 24. Was the day of our departure from <hi>Moscou,</hi> in order to our return. The two
<hi>Pristafs</hi> came about noon, accompany'd by a certain number of Musketiers, who had brought
with them those two Sledges, which we had made use of at our last audience, and conducted
us in very good order a quarter of a League from the City; where we took leave of them, as
also of those friends who had brought us so far on our way.</p>

of Wheat. <hi>Eric,</hi> K. of <hi>Sueden,</hi> took it from the <hi>Poles,</hi> in the year 1562. but they recovered
it again by stratagem, in the year 1565. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> became Masters of it <hi>Iuly</hi> 9. 1575.
but it was re-united to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> with the rest of <hi>Livonia,</hi> by the Treaty of Peace

her, and to make proffers of service to her in their names. She took it so kindly, that not
content to make us drink his Highnesse's health three times over, she forc'd us to take the bovvls
out of her ovvn hands, and in the mean time entertain'd us vvith much excellent discourse, in
commendation of his Highness and that Embassy; as also concerning the manners and Religion

Henry de la Tour,</hi> her father-in-lavv. She sent also to desire the Ambassadors to recommend
her sons to his Highness, and to assure him of their services, when they should be of an age,
and in a capacity to do him any. As we were getting on hors-back, our Host shew'd himself
an honest man, and refus'd to take our money, telling us, the Countess had sent in most of
the Provisions for the Ambassadors Supper, and that the rest was not worth the reckoning:
so that to require his sincerity we gave him twenty Crowns. But we were not got a League off
the City, ere we were overtaken by a man he had sent, to return us our money, and to tell
us the Present was too small, in requital of the trouble we had given him. We sent back our
Harbinger, with the Messenger, who gave the Host twelve Crowns more, wherewith he
seem'd to be satisfy'd.</p>

obtain the neutrality of all the neighbouring Princes, so that it is very likely, the Treaty to

good Beer, which made us spend some part of the night in carowsing: the Wine having the
vertue of contracting a great friendship between the Ambassadors and him. The next day he
gave us a very sumptuous entertainment, and the divertisement of Timbrells; and that all might
be compleat, in the treatment, he would needs bring in his two Daughters, whom we had not
seen the night before. He also presented the Ambassadors, one with a Fire-lock, the other
with a Sword: and the Ambassadors gave him each of them a fair Watch. This breakfast,

and in acknowledgement of the assistance he had brought them against the Heathens in
those parts. It is now much bigger than it was then, inasmuch as, besides the suburbs, which
are very great, there was added in the year 1300. that part of the city which is called <hi>Lebenicht,</hi>
and in the year 1380. that of <hi>Kniphof,</hi> both which have their several Magistrates, both as to
policy and administration of Justice. The Palace ows its perfection to <hi>George Frederick,</hi> of

remarkable things, there is a Hall, that hath no pillars, and yet is 274 Geometrical feet

<hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> first Duke of <hi>Prussia,</hi> made and writ with his own hand, for the

hath quitted all pretension of Soveraignty over the Dutchy of <hi>Prussia,</hi> by the last treaty it made
with his Electoral Highness of <hi>Brandenbourg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We left <hi>Coningsberg, Feb.</hi> 24. and came the next day to <hi>Elbing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Elbing.</note> a City seated upon a River
of the same name, between the Lake of <hi>Drauser,</hi> and the <hi>Frishaf,</hi> in the Royal, or Polish
<hi>Prussia.</hi> It is not very big, but its streets are streight and spacious; and its fortifications, made
by the late King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> during the last War of <hi>Poland,</hi> before his entrance into <hi>Germany,</hi>
are very regular. If he who is Master of it, were also Commander of the Fort of <hi>Pilau,</hi> which
the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> is possess'd of, at the entrance of the <hi>Frishaf,</hi> it might be made a very
considerable place for Commerce.</p>
                     <p>The 27. we came to <hi>Dantsig,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dantsig.</note> where we staid 16 or 17 days, during which time, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
treated us with the ordinary Presents of refreshments, and the principal Inhabitants
gave us several noble entertainments. The <hi>Polanders</hi> call this place <hi>Gdansko,</hi> whence comes
the modern <hi>Latine</hi> word <hi>Gedanum.</hi> It is not very antient, and yet it cannot be certainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
whether it was built by the Dukes of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> or by the <hi>Danes,</hi> since it seems to have
its name from the later. It was a long time possess'd by the Dukes of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and afterwards
by the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> and by the Masters of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order in <hi>Prussia.</hi> In the year 1454
it redeem'd it self out of subjection to the Order, and made a voluntary rendition of it self to
<hi>Casimir,</hi> King of <hi>Poland.</hi> It is situated in <hi>Cassuba,</hi> upon the <hi>Vistula,</hi> and <hi>Rodauna,</hi> which
they say is the <hi>Eridanus</hi> of the Antients (because in that place there is found much yellow am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
and near the <hi>Moslava,</hi> which falls into the <hi>Vistula,</hi> a quarter of a league below the City.
But the River is so shallow there, that great Ships cannot come up to the City:
Towards the West, it hath several mounts of sand, which they were forc'd to bring
within the fortifications, because they commanded the city: though Canon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be discharg'd to any great purpose, when they shoot point-blank downwards, and that
there would not have been space enough between the mount and the ditch, to put forces in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and to give an assault. Towards the South and North, it hath a pleasant Plain, and on
the East, the River. It is well built, but the streets not over-clean. The publick Structures are
magnificent, and those of private persons very commodious, and handsome. On the other
side of the <hi>Moslava,</hi> lies part of the Suburbs, called <hi>Schotland,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> as large as a
pretty little City, but it depends not on the City of <hi>Dantsig,</hi> but on the Bishop of <hi>Cujavia.</hi> It
hath its seat and suffrage in the Diets of <hi>Poland,</hi> even in those which are called for the election
of the King. 'Tis one of the four Cities, which have the superintendency of all the <hi>Teutonick</hi>
Association, or <hi>Hanseatick</hi> Towns, and hath so many other Privileges, that, though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47786:24"/>
to <hi>Poland,</hi> and gives the King half the duties raised there, yet does it in a manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
an absolute freedome. There is so great a Commerce of Wheat in this City, that it is
thought, there are sold every year above seven hundred and thirty thousand Tuns, whereof
two make a Last. The Magistracy consists of fourteen Senators, and four Burgomasters;
whereto are to be added the Governour, appointed by the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> some Escheuins, or
Sheriffs, for civil and criminal causes, and a hundred Counsellors for affairs of importance.
Criminal causes are finally judged, without admitting any appeal, as also Civil, not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thousand Livers. It makes Statutes, and imposes taxes upon the Inhabitants, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the exigencies of publick Affairs, without staying for any superiour Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and regulates the exercise of those Religions that are permitted by the Laws of the
Empire.</p>

is at 53 deg. 27. min. latitude, and 38 d. 45. m. longitude, seated in a very pleasant place,
upon the descent of a Hill. The River <hi>Oder</hi> divides it self there into four branches, whereof
that which runs by the City keeps its name (the others taking those of <hi>Parnits,</hi> and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and lesser <hi>Kegelitz</hi>) and straggles so, as that to come to the City from <hi>Dam</hi>-side, a man
must pass over six bridges, which, put together, are in length, 996 <hi>German</hi> ells, and 24 foot
broad, and are all joyn'd by a noble Causey, well paved, and having in the middle a Royal
Fort. The structures of it are beautiful, and it is excellently well fortify'd, especially since
the <hi>Suedes</hi> became Masters of it. <hi>Iohn Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> in the year 1575. laid
the first foundations of the sumptuous Palace which is there built after the Italian Architecture,
with very noble appartements, where, before these last Warrs, there were worth the seeing,
a noble Library, a Magazine of Arms, many rarities, and the rich Wardrop and Plate of the
Dukes of <hi>Pomerania.</hi> 'Tis one of the <hi>Hanseatick</hi> Towns, and enjoyes many great Privileges,
among others, that of obliging strangers to disburthen in the City all the Merchandises which
pass through it, what nature soever they are of: as also that the Gentlemen thereabouts cannot
build any Castle or strong place any way within three Leagues from it; nay, that the Dukes
of <hi>Pomerania</hi> themselves cannot build any Fort upon the <hi>Oder,</hi> or the <hi>Suine,</hi> or upon the
<hi>Frishaf,</hi> between that and the Sea. But this advantage is lost by it's coming into the hands of the <hi>Suedes.</hi>

of <hi>Niclot,</hi> last Prince of the <hi>Obotrites,</hi> incompass'd it with a wall, in the year 1160. and made
it a City out of the ruins of that of <hi>Kessin,</hi> which <hi>Henry le Lyon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> had destroy'd.
Its Port is not commodious, in regard Vessels of burthen are forc'd to unload at <hi>Warnemunde,</hi>
two Leagues below the City, at the mouth of the River. The City is handsome enough, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
three great Market-places, 27 streets, 14 little gates, and four great gates. Its University
is one of the most antient in all <hi>Germany,</hi> and was founded, by <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Albert,</hi> Cousin-Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Dukes of <hi>Mecklenbourg,</hi> who, together with the Magistrate, opened it in the year 1419.
Among its Professors are many very great Persons, of whom one was <hi>Albert Crantz</hi> Rector of
it in the year 1482. This City, having been taken by the Imperialists, in the year 1629. with
all the rest of the Dutchy of <hi>Mecklenbourg,</hi> the late King of <hi>Sueden, Gustavus Adolphus,</hi> besieg'd it
in the year 1631. and took it the 16. of <hi>Octob.</hi> the same year.</p>
                     <p>The 30. of <hi>March,</hi> we left <hi>Rostock,</hi> and came the same day to <hi>Wismar,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wismar.</note> seven Leagues. Those
who say this City was built by <hi>Wismar,</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals</hi> about the year 340. tell a fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
story, whereof the vanity is so much the more visible, in that it is certain, that it was no
City, till <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mecklenbourg,</hi> made it such, by the privileges he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
on it, in the year 1266. It is near as big as <hi>Rostock,</hi> and its Port, which no doubt is one
of the best upon the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, brings it very great Traffick. Its situation, being amidst Fenns,
and upon the Sea, is very advantageous, and its Citadel fortify'd with five regular Bastions,
makes it one of the most considerable places in all <hi>Germany. Adolphus Frederick,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Mecklenbourg,</hi> and General <hi>Todt,</hi> took it, <hi>Ian.</hi> 10. 1632. from Colonel <hi>Gramma,</hi> who had
the command of it, for the D. of <hi>Fridland;</hi> ever since which time the <hi>Suedes</hi> have kept it, as one
of the most precious Jewels of their Crown.</p>
                     <p>The last of <hi>March,</hi> we came to the Castle of <hi>Schonberg,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Schonberg</note> belonging to the Duke of <hi>Mecklen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
where some friends of our Comrade, <hi>Iohn Albert de Mandelslo,</hi> received us, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us very nobly. For my part, I am particularly oblig'd to acknowledge their kindness, for,
being casually shot in the arm with a pistol by one of our company, I was forc'd to stay there
two or three dayes, during which time I receiv'd very great civilities from them.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Lubeck.</note> This City is so well known, that I need not
give any particular description of it, after so many other Authors that have written of it. Only I
shall say, that it is situated between the Rivers of <hi>Traue</hi> and <hi>Wagenits,</hi> at 28. d. 20. m. longitude,
and at 54. d. 48. m. latitude, two leagues from the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea. Those who have chiefly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted

to the building of it, were, <hi>Adolphus</hi> II. Count of <hi>Holstein, Henry le Lion,</hi> Duke of

and <hi>Frederick</hi> II. his Grand-Son, gave it some of those Privileges, which it enjoyes to this
day. It lies in the <hi>Wagria,</hi> at the entrance of the Country of <hi>Holstein,</hi> and is very well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,
according to the modern fortification, having, besides the other advantages which it hath

                        <hi>Archivi</hi> are kept in the Guild-Hall of this City. How considerable it is in the

which amount to 21 horsemen, and 177 foot, and, reduc'd to money to 1980 Livers a mouth.

the Peace between the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II. and <hi>Christian</hi> IV. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
in the year 1629. The Bishoprick of <hi>Wagria,</hi> which was transferr'd from <hi>Aldenbourg</hi>

who lives at <hi>Oitin.</hi> Here also I escaped another great misfortune; as I alighted off my
horse, I fell upon my wounded arm, but ere I could get up again, <hi>Mandelslo</hi>'s horse, which
was furious and skittish, startingthereat, stood up on his hinder feet, and very narrowly miss'd
my head with his fore-feet. We travel'd on, in the Afternoon, and came that night to an Inn in
the suburbs of <hi>Arnsbock.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Arnsbock.</note> This little city, lying in <hi>Wagria,</hi> between <hi>Lubeck</hi> and <hi>Pretz,</hi> belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

                     <p>The next day we broke our fast at the Castle, which done, we were brought in the Duke's

our people, into a new Ship, that had never been at Sea before. The wind serv'd as well as
could be wish'd, to get out of the Harbour, and yet we met with such a strong current of water,
that we could not avoid falling foul on two great Ships that were in the Port, between which
we were so intangled, that we could not in three hours dis-engage our selves. Which many
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47786:26"/>
among us took for an ill omen of the misfortune that happen'd to us some few dayes after.</p>

                        <hi>Oct.</hi> 28. about five in the morning, after prayers said, we set sail with a West-South-West
wind, which growing higher at noon, was at night heightned to a dreadful Tempest. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
all night, during which, we discover'd, that our Mariners were as raw as the Ship was
new, which had never seen the Sea till that time; and it was our continual fear that the Mast
would slip out of its place, in as much as, the ropes, being new, stretch'd so, that they seem'd not to
have any hold of it.</p>
                     <p>The 29. we found our selves to be on the Coasts of <hi>Denmark,</hi> which our Captain took for
the Isle of <hi>Bornholm,</hi> and we perceived, that we had directed our course streight towards the
Country of <hi>Schonen;</hi> so that if we had not at the break of day, discover'd Land, and found we
were at 4. fathom water, which soon oblig'd us to alter our course, there had been an end of
both us and our Ship. About 9. of the clock we discover'd the Island of <hi>Bornholm,</hi> and the wind
being fair, made all the fail we could. But about ten at night, when we thought our selves most
secure, and made accompt to rest our selves after the precedent night's toil, even, while <hi>Brug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>

such a horrible noise, that it made all start up. The amazement we were in surpris'd us so, that
there was not any one but might easily be perswaded, that the end of both his Voyage and Life
were neer at hand.</p>

caus'd some Muskets to be discharg'd, to see if there were any help to be had neer us. But no
body made answer, and the Ship beginning to lye on one side, our affliction began to turn into
despair; so that most cast themselves on their knees, begging of God, with horrid cries, that he
would send them that relief which they could not expect from men.</p>
                     <p>The Master himself wept most bitterly, and would meddle no further with the conduct of the

one another, and to die together, as old and faithful friends, in case we should be wrack'd. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
took leave one of another, or made vows to God, which they afterwards so Religiously
kept, that coming to <hi>Reuel,</hi> they made up a portion for a Poor, but Virtuous Maid, who was

age, and he had cast himself upon the ground, importuning Heaven with incessant cries and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
and saying, <hi>Son of David have mercy on me;</hi> whereto the Minister added, Lord, if
thou wilt not hear us, be pleas'd to hear this Child, and consider the innocence of his age. At
last God was so gracious as to preserve us, though the Ship struck several times, with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
against the Rock.</p>
                     <p>About one in the morning, we saw fire, whence we inferr'd that we were not far from Land.
The Ambassadors commanded the Boat to be cast out, with design to get into it, with each of
them a Servant, and to go streight towards the fire, to see if there were any means to save the
rest: but no sooner had they thrown in two Cabinets, in which were the Credential Letters and
some Jewels, ere it was full of water, which had almost occasion'd the loss of two of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who had leapt first into it, thinking to save themselves; in so much that they had much
ado to get into the Ship ere the Boat sunk. We were forc'd to continue there the rest of that
night, expecting to see a period of that danger.</p>
                     <p>At break of day we discover'd the Isle of <hi>Oleand,</hi> and saw the ruins of a <hi>Danish</hi> Ship, which
had been cast away thereabouts a month before. The wind being somewhat abated, two Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Isle came aboard us, and Landed the Ambassadors, having a very considerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for their pains, and after them, some of their retinue.</p>
                     <p>About noon, we found the two Cabinets, and when the Sea was a little calm'd, many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Isle came in to our relief, to get off our Ship from among those Rocks: but with this
misfortune, that as they would have let down the Anchor, which they had carried in the Boat
about a hundred paces from the Ship, the Boat over-turn'd, so that those in it were toss'd into
the Sea. Our Masters Mate went immediately with one of the Isle boats to their relief; and in
regard, as they were over-turn'd, some caught hold of the Boat, others of an Oar, or somewhat
else, as also that the Wine they had drunk a little before, had somewhat heightned their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
we had the time to send twice to them, and to save all but our Carpenter, who was lost
for want of having fasten'd on somewhat that might have kept him above water.</p>
                     <p>While they were getting off our Ship, the waters increas'd so, as that the wind, coming to the
North-West, made our passage thence into the Sea the easier. Whither we were no sooner
gotten, but the wind turn'd again to South-West, and brought us safely through the streight of
<hi>Calmer,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The streight of <hi>Calmer.</hi>
                        </note> which is so much the more dangerous in that season of the year, in as much as the Sea
thereabouts is full of Rocks, and that even in the Summer time, it is ill sailing there by reason
of the banks of Sand. The Ship stay'd for the Ambassadors, at <hi>Calmer,</hi> whither they got by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47786:26"/>
Land, upon the first of <hi>November,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">NOVEM.</note> and came aboard neer an old ruin'd fort, called <hi>Ferstat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Being come to <hi>Calmer,</hi> we sent back a Page and a Lacquey to <hi>Gottorp,</hi> to get other Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,
the Sea-water having spoil'd those we had at first. It was there also taken into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether it were not our best course to take our way by Land, through <hi>Sueden,</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
our Voyage by Sea. The latter was resolv'd on; and that we might do it with the less
danger, we laid out for a skilfull Master for the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea; but there being none to be had,
we took only two Pilots, who conducted us half a League through the Sand banks, till we
were got into the main Sea.</p>
                     <p>The 3. we continu'd our course, and pass'd by a Rock called, the <hi>Suedish Lady,</hi> which we
left on the lar-board. From <hi>Calmer</hi> thither are accounted eight Leagues.</p>
                     <p>About noon, we spy'd the Castle of <hi>Bornholm,</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Oeland.</hi> At night we doubled
the point of the Isle, with such a Tempest from the North-East, that the fore-part of the Ship
was more under water than above it, and ever and anon our sails were wash'd by the Waves.</p>
                     <p>Another misfortune was, that our Pump was out of order, in so much that till it could be
made to do its Office, all the Kettles and other Vessels were little enough to empty out the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This trouble lasted till the next day at noon, with so much danger to us, that if the wind
had not chang'd, it would have been impossible for us to escape shipwrack. But the wind being
somewhat better for us than it had been, we kept on our course, and came towards night in sight
of <hi>Gotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Isle of <hi>Gotland</hi> is opposite to the Province of <hi>Scandinavia,</hi>

Naruig,</hi> and <hi>Heiligolm. Ostergaar</hi> is a small Isle standing at an equal distance from the two
points of the great one, with a convenient Harbour, for those who can avoid the Sand-banks,
which thereabouts reach out a good way into the Sea. <hi>Sleidaf</hi> is higher towards the North, than

Town in all the Island; but there are above 500. Farms, and the Churches are built within a
League distance one of another, as they are in the Isle of <hi>Oeland,</hi> so that the Steeples give a great
direction to the Ships that sail that way. The Inhabitants are <hi>Danes,</hi> and the Island was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> till that after a tedious War it submitted to the Crown of <hi>Sueden,</hi>
to which it payes annually 100. lasts of Pitch. All their Traffick lies in Cattel, and Wood, for
building and fire, and thence the best deal Boards come. I would needs, with some other Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades,
go and see the Town of <hi>Wisby.</hi> It is built on the descent of a Rock, upon the Sea side,
encompass'd with a good Wall, and fortify'd with some bastions. The ruins of 14. Churches,
and several Houses, Gates, and Walls of Free-stone and Marble, which we observ'd there, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
it hath been bigger than it now is. It is said, that the foundations of it were laid, about the
end of the eighth Age, and that it hath been since so populous, that it had 12000. Inhabitants,
for the most part Merchants, not accounting the <hi>Danes, Suedes, Vandols, Saxons, Muscovites,
Iews, Greeks, Prussians, Poles,</hi> and <hi>Livonians,</hi> who traded thither. There, they say, were made
the first Orders concerning maritime affairs, which <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and the other <hi>Hanseatick</hi> Cities still
make use of; But now the Port is quite lost, so as that Ships cannot get into it.</p>
                     <p>The 5. the wind became more boisterous than before, so that the Vessel, at every great Sea,
was all under water. About 10. at night, we sounded, at 12. fathom; whereupon we chang'd
our course, and got into the main Sea, for fear of running against the Land, which if we had,
we must needs have been cast away.</p>
                     <p>The 6. we met a <hi>Holland</hi> Vessel, which directed us towards the Isle of <hi>Tageroort,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tageroort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> whither we
came at night; but, the same night, we were again forc'd into the main Sea.</p>
                     <p>The 7. at noon, we were upon the point of <hi>Tageroort;</hi> but the Masters Mate was mistaken,
who, thinking the wind would have carried us North-ward, would perswade us it was <hi>Oetgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sholm,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Oetgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sholm.</note>
and upon that presumption, imprudently engag'd himself in a most dangerous passage,
called the <hi>Hondeshuig.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Honde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuig.</note> He was not convinc'd of his error, till he saw the Church-Steeple; so
that we were forc'd to return into the main, with greater hazard than we had run, at our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into that passage. That day, we met a bark, which had lost its course; so that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
we intended for <hi>Reuel,</hi> she follow'd us a while, but at night left us, and cast Anchor
before <hi>Tageroort,</hi> and, as we heard since, came safely the next day to <hi>Reuel.</hi> All the afternoon
we lost not sight of the coasts of <hi>Livonia,</hi> and at night were within a League of the Isle of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Narga.</note>
which is at the entrance of the Haven of <hi>Reuel.</hi> Our Master and his Mate, would ueither
go into, nor anchor before <hi>Tageroort,</hi> choosing rather the main Sea, though in a great Tempest,
which kept us in action all that night, and took away our Main-mast, which was soon follow'd
by the Mizen, and the fore-castle, and it was no less than a miracle, that our compass was left
us, without which it had been impossible for us to have kept on our intended course.</p>
                     <p>The 8. we perceiv'd that we had pass'd the Haven of <hi>Reuel,</hi> and about ten, the weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47786:27"/>
to foul, that it seem'd rather an Earthquake, that should turn the World upside down,
than a storm. Our danger and fears encreas'd till three in the afternoon, that one of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
having got up into the scuttle of the sprit-sale, told us, he discover'd <hi>Hogland.</hi> We got
thither by 7 at night, and cast Anchor at 19 fathom water. There we stayd the 9. and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that thence-forward, Prayers should be said twice a day, to give God thanks for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
the day before, from a danger we could not have avoided, otherwise than by passing
among the Rocks upon the Coasts of <hi>Finland,</hi> as we must have resolv'd to do, if we had not
discover'd that Island. The Ambassadors went ashore, to observe the situation of the Country,
and refresh themselves. At night it was consider'd, whether we should continue our Voyage
by Sea to <hi>Narva,</hi> or return to <hi>Reuel;</hi> but the diversity of Opinions was such, that nothing was
resolv'd on. About 9 at night, the Master came to the Ambassadors Lodgings, to tell them,
that the wind being East, and forcing the Ship towards the Shore, he saw no liklier way to be
safe than by making for <hi>Reuel.</hi> The Ambassadors bade him do what he thought most convenient,
and went aboard: but as they were weighing Anchor, the wind riss so, that there was no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of taking the course intended, so that the Master and his Counsel chang'd their design,
and thought it best to ly still at Anchor, for fear of running-a-ground. But all to no purpose.
For being near the shore, the Orders given could not be put in execution with diligence enough
to avoid shipwrack. All could be done was to let down the Boat, and to set the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
ashore with some of their retinue. After the Ship had struck several times against
certain pieces of Rocks, whereof there is abundance all along the Coast, it split and
sunk. All the men were sav'd, a good part of the goods, and seven horses, whereof two
dy'd the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> day.</p>
                     <p>We shelter'd our selves in Fishers huts, along the Sea-side, where we met with some <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
that dwelt thereabouts who could speak nothing but the jargon of the country. That poor
refuge sav'd their lives who had escap'd the wrack; else, their cloaths being all wet about them,
most of them would have been starv'd to death in the snow, which fell the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                     <p>The 10. we thought fit to try whether any more of the goods could be gotten out of the Ship;
but the rough weather continuing, none would venture going near it with a Boat, till that in
the afternoon some things were gotten out. Our Cloaths, Books, and other things we laid out
a-drying, the Sea water having injur'd some, and utterly spoil'd others.</p>
                     <p>The greatest of our losses was that of a Clock, worth four thousand crowns, which the
horses had broke to pieces, by striving to get loose.</p>
                     <p>This misfortune was follow'd by another, which though we saw at some distance, yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
us no less; and that was, want of provisions. The Sea-water had spoil'd ours, and
our fear was, that the frost forcing us to winter in the Island, we must either be starved, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to the extremities of feeding on the barks of trees, as some that had been cast away there
some years before, were constrain'd to do. We had but little bread left, and the Bisket was
so soak'd in Salt-water, that we were forc'd to boyl it in fresh, with a little Cummin or Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
and so made a Pottage of it for our Servants. One day, we took in a Brook which falls
from the Mountains, as many small Fishes as found us two good meals.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hogland</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Island of <hi>Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </note> hath its name from the <hi>height</hi> of its situation, it being seen a great way into the Sea,
and is about 3 leagues in length, and one, in breadth. You see nothing but Rocks, Firr-trees,
and Thorns. We indeed saw some few Hares, which in Winter turn white, as they do all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Livonia;</hi> but our Dogs could not follow them through the VVoods, and over the
Rocks.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, it was reported at <hi>Reuel,</hi> that we were all lost, rais'd by this, that there
had been dead bodies found upon the coast of <hi>Livonia,</hi> clad in red, which was our Livery; as
also with this addition, that, the Bark, spoken of before, had related, that she had seen us car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with the storm beyond the bay of <hi>Reuel.</hi> Besides, it was eight days before they heard
from us; so that those of our people whom we had left there, at our return from <hi>Muscovy,</hi>
were seeking out other services, when M. <hi>Vchterits</hi> (then Chamberlain to the Ambassadors,
and now Gentleman of the Privy-chamber to his Highness of <hi>Holstein</hi> at <hi>Gottorp</hi>) brought them
an accompt of us. We had the convenience to send him thither in one of the two <hi>Finland</hi> barks,
which the tempest had forc'd to that Island on the 3 of <hi>November.</hi>

in two Fisher-boats, to pass over to the continent, from which this Island is distant above 12.
leagues. Nor were we in less danger now than before, for as much as the Boats, being small
and old, were not caulked, and were ty'd above, only with cords made of barks of trees. The
sail was a great many rags fasten'd together, and so order'd, that there was no use to be made
of it but when the wind blew right a-stern: so that the wind beginning to shift, after we had
come five leagues, the Fisher-men would have tack'd about, but we prevail'd with them to let
down the sail, and to make use of their Oars, to get to an Island which was within half a league
of us, and where we arriv'd that night. We found there only two ruin'd hutts; we made a fire,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47786:27"/>
and pass'd over the night, but having neither Bread nor Meat, we made our supper on a piece
of <hi>Milan</hi> Cheese we had left.</p>
                     <p>The next day, we prosecuted our Voyage with a very good wind and fair weather, though the
Sea was a little rough. Having made two leagues, a sudden blast coming from the East, though
the wind were North turn'd the Boat, in which I was, with the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> so
much upon one side, that it took in water; the surges at the same time rising half an ell above
the brinck of it. All the Fisher-men could do was to let down the sail, and to run to the other
side of the boat to weigh it down. The blast being over, we kept on our course, till a second
put us to the same trouble. We had three of them in less than two hours; and this I think the
greatest danger we had met with, in our Voyage: in as much as the Boat being old, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in it, eight Persons, all the Silver Plate and other luggage, which in a manner fill'd it, so
as that one wave might have overwhelm'd it, and cast us all away. But afterwards, when the
Fisher-men saw the blast coming, they turn'd the side of the Boat to the wind, that the wave
might not come with its full force upon it, and by that means we avoided the danger. Within
three Leagues of Land we had also a violent shower of hail; but what is most to be admir'd in
all this, was, that the Boat which carried the Ambassador <hi>Crusius,</hi> though within Pistol-shot of
us, felt nothing of all this, but had fair weather all along.</p>
                     <p>Being gotten within half a League of Land, the wind, shifting to the South, was just in our
teeth, and had oblig'd our Fisher-men to return, if the hope of a three-pint-Flagon of strong
water, which we promis'd them, had not given them the courage to let down the sail, and to
row us ashore.<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors come into <hi>Livonia.</hi>

dayes upon the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, with all the danger that is to be expected by those, who trust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the mercy of that Element in so uncertain a season.</p>
                     <p>The 22. came to <hi>Hogland</hi> two other barks forc'd thither by foul weather: Those we had left
of ours in the Island pass'd in them to the continent, whither they came the 24. with the horses
and baggage. We went thence to <hi>Kunda,</hi> a house belonging to my late Father-in-Law, <hi>Iohn
Muller,</hi> distant two Leagues from the Sea, where we staid three weeks, to refresh our selves
after so much hardship at Sea. Most of us fell sick, yet none kept their beds above three dayes.

                     <p>The Ambassadors having all their people about them at <hi>Reuel,</hi> thought fit to publish the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which the Duke would have observ'd through the whole Voyage. They had brought it
with them seal'd with his Highnesse's Great Seal: but they added some things thereto, the better
to prevent the disorders, which are but too frequent where there are so many Servants. But in
regard they contain'd nothing extraordinary, we shall not insert them here, and only say, they
were ill observ'd: for the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> having arm'd the Lacquies with Pole-axes,
which had Pistols in their handles, and given order they should not take any affront from the
Inhabitants of <hi>Reuel,</hi> there hardly pass'd a day during the three Moneths we staid there, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation

a person of a good humour and not quarrellous, hearing the noise of an engagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Ambassadors Servants and the Apprentices of the City, and desirous to relieve his
friends, was struck over the head with an iron-bar, which bruis'd the skull so, as that he dyed
the next day. The Magistrate did all lay in his power to find out the Murtherer; but, to no
purpose, so that all the reparation was, that the Senate, together with the Ambassadors and
their retinue, accompany'd him to the grave.</p>

confirmed to it by all the Treaties that have been made between the Kings of <hi>Suoden,</hi> and Dukes

'Tis true it hath lost some of these advantages since the last War of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> which were taken
away, left, in imitation of several other of the <hi>Hanseatick</hi> Towns, it should attempt a defection
from its Prince, yet does it still enjoy many other privileges, which have been confirmed to it,
from time to time, by the Masters of the <hi>Order,</hi> while they were Lords of the Country, and
afterwards by the Kings their Successors. It observes the same Customes with <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and

good Scholars, who consummate their studies at <hi>Derpt,</hi> or some other Universities in those
quarters. The Government of the City is Democratical, the Magistrate being oblig'd to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the principal of several Professions, and the most antient Inhabitants, to consultations that
concern affairs of Importance. There are still to be seen, within half a League of the City,
towards the Sea-side, the ruins of a fair Monastery, founded by a Merchant of that City, at
the beginning of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> age, out of a particular devotion he had for St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> under <hi>Conrad

It consisted of both Religious Men and Women, and the Book I saw of the foundation of this

a way to express their meanings one to another by signs, of which there is in it a little

                        <hi>Livonia,</hi> and its Lords, the Masters of the <hi>Order,</hi> of whom we shall speak hereafter, were
subject to the Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> not only since the Conquest of that Island from the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
by the <hi>Germans,</hi> but also, particularly since that in the year 1513. the Archbishop of
<hi>Riga,</hi> with his Suffragans, and the Master of the <hi>Order,</hi> who had freed himself
from the subjection of that, of <hi>Prussia,</hi> were receiv'd among the Princes of the
Empire. Let us now see how it is gone from the Empire. The <hi>Muscovite</hi> looking
on this Province as lying very convenient for him, enter'd it, in the year 1501. with
a powerful Army; but <hi>Gualtier de Plettenberg,</hi> Master of the <hi>Order,</hi> gave him battel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
above 40000 <hi>Muscovites</hi> were kill'd upon the place. This defeat produc'd a Cessation of
50 years. In the year 1558. <hi>Iohn Basilouits,</hi> Great Duke of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> having added to his
territories the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Cassan</hi> and <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and willing to make his advantages of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between the Master of the <hi>Order,</hi> and Archbishop of <hi>Riga,</hi> enter'd <hi>Livonia,</hi> and having
made incursions into the Bishoprick of <hi>Derpt,</hi> and <hi>Wirland,</hi> retreated into <hi>Muscovy.</hi> During
these troubles, the <hi>Livonians</hi> were importunate with the Estates of the Empire, to send them
relief against so cruel and barbarous an enemy; but none being to be expected, the City of
<hi>Reuel,</hi> which was the most expos'd to danger, offer'd it self to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his refusal, apply'd it self to <hi>Eric</hi> King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and desir'd of him a considerable succour
of men and money. His answer was, that his Kingdom was not in a condition to supply them
with either, but if the Town would put it self under his protection, he would maintain all its
Privileges, and defend it against the <hi>Muscovite.</hi> Upon which, the City, having advis'd with
the adjacent Nobility, broke off from the Master of the <hi>Order,</hi> and put it self under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> in the year 1560. The year before, 1559. the Archbishop of
<hi>Riga,</hi> and the Coadjutor of the <hi>Order,</hi> had made their addresses to <hi>Sigis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ducats towards the charges of the War, engaging to him, for his security, nine of the best

was likely to be lost, through the divisions of the Province, and that the City of <hi>Reuel,</hi>

to send the relief promised, unless the Archbishop, and Master of the Order, would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

and Privileges they had obtain'd from the Empire and Pope, with the Seal, and other marks of

of righteousness began to break in upon them, occasion'd by the frequentation of certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of <hi>Bremen,</hi> and the Commerce they were desirous to establish in those parts. About the
year 1158. one of their Ships having been forc'd by a Tempest into the Gulf of <hi>Riga,</hi> which was
not yet known, the Merchants agreed so well with the Inhabitants of the Country, that they
resolv'd to continue their Traffick there, having withall, this satisfaction, that, the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very simple, they thought it would be no hard matter to reduce them to Christianity. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi>
a Monk of <hi>Segeberg,</hi> was the first that preach'd the Gospel to them, and was made first Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

of <hi>Livonia,</hi> by <hi>Bertold,</hi> a <hi>Monk,</hi> of the Order of white Friers; but he, thinking to
reduce those people rather by Arms than the word of God, met with a success accordingly, for
having incens'd them, they kill'd him in the year 1186. and with him 11000. Christians. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>

the third, and by vertue of a power he had given them, to allow them the third part of
that they should Conquer from the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> They observ'd the same rule as the <hi>Templars,</hi>
and were call'd <hi>Friers</hi> or <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>short sword,</hi> because they had on their <hi>white</hi> Cloaks a
red <hi>short sword,</hi> with a star of the same colour, which they have chang'd since into two <hi>short
Swords, Saltar-wise.</hi> But in regard this new Religious Profession was not fully setled, it was
joyn'd to the Order of St. <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the person of <hi>Herman Balk,</hi> Grand-Master of
<hi>Prussia,</hi> in the year 1238. And it is since that time that the Master <hi>Livonia</hi> had a dependence
on the Grand-Master of <hi>Prussia,</hi> which was, till <hi>Sigismond</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> chang'd that quality
into that of Duke of <hi>Courland,</hi> in the person of <hi>Godard Ketler,</hi> as is said before.</p>
                     <p>All the Champain Countrey, of the two Provinces of <hi>Letthie</hi> and <hi>Esthonie,</hi> is to this day
peopled with these <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who have nothing of their own, but are slaves, and serve the
Nobility in the Countrey, and the Citizens in Cities. They are called <hi>Unteutche,</hi> that is, <hi>not-Germans,</hi>
because their language was not understood by the <hi>Germans,</hi> who went to plant in
those quarters; though that of <hi>Letthie</hi> hath nothing common with that of <hi>Esthonie,</hi> no more
than there is between them, as their Cloaths and manner of Life. The Women of <hi>Esthonie</hi>
wear their Petticoats very narrow, and without any folds, like sacks, adorn'd above on their
backs with many little brass Chains, having at the ends Counters of the same metal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
set out with a certain lacing of yellow glass. Those who would express a greater bravery,
have about their Necks a Necklace of plates of silver of the bigness of a Crown, or half-Crown,
and upon the breast, one as big as a round Trencher, but not much thicker than the back of a
knife.</p>
                     <p>Maids wear nought on their heads, Summer nor Winter, and cut their hair as the men do,
letting it fall negligently down about the head. Both Men and Women are clad with a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
stuff made of Wool, or a coarse Linnen. They are yet unacquainted with Tannage, so that,
in Summer, they have barks of Trees about their feet, and in the Winter, raw Leather of a
Cow's hide. Both Men and Women do ordinarily carry all the Wealth they have about them.</p>
                     <p>Their Ceremonies of marriage are very odd.<note place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of marriages in <hi>Livonia.</hi>
                        </note> When a Country fellow marries a Lass out of
another Village, he goes a hors-back to fetch her, sets her behind him, and makes her embrace
him with the right hand. He hath in his hand a stick cleft at the top, where he puts a piece of brass
money, which he gives to him who opens the wicket, through which he is to pass. Before, rides
a man that playes upon the Bag-pipe, as also two of his friends, who, having naked swords in
their hands, give two stroaks therewith, cross the Door of the House, where the marriage is to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47786:31"/>
be consummated, and then they thrust the point of one of the swords into a beam, over the
Bridegroom's head, which is done to prevent Charms, which, they say, are ordinary in that
Country. 'Tis to the same end that the Bride scatters little pieces of Cloath, or red Serge by the
way, especially where cross-ways meet, near Crosses, and upon the Graves of little Children
dead without baptism, whom they bury in the High-ways. She hath a Veil over her face while
she is at the Table, which is not long; for, as soon almost as the Guests are set down, the
married couple rise, and go to bed. About two hours after they get up, and are brought to
sit down at the Table. Having drunk and danc'd till such time as they are able to stand no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
they fall down on the floor, and sleep altogether like so many Swine.</p>

better Christians for it. Most of them are only such in name, and can hardly yet abstain from
their Heathenish Superstitions. For though they are <hi>Lutherans,</hi> by profession, and that there
is hardly a Village but hath its Church and Minister; yet are they so poorly instructed, and so
far from regeneration, that it may be said, Baptism excepted, they have not any Character of
Christianity. They very seldom go to Sermons, and never almost Communicate. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
their backwardness in frequenting the Sacraments, by alleging the great slavery they are in,
which, they say, is so insupportable, that they have not time to mind their Devotions. If they
go at any time to Sermon, or to the Communion, it is by force, or upon some other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
accompt. To this effect is a story was told me by <hi>Andrew Besiq,</hi> Provost of the Church
of <hi>Luckenhausen,</hi> which was, That having been sent for to comfort, and administer the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
to a Country-fellow who lay very sick, he ask'd him how he came to send for his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
in the condition he was then in, when for so many years before he had never bethought
him of reconciling himself to God? The fellow ingenuously answer'd, that, for his own part,
he should not have minded it then, but what he did, was by the advice of a friend, who told
him, that if he did it not, he could not be buried in the Church-yard, nor carried to the
ground with the ordinary Ceremonies. 'Tis true, the gross and inexcusable ignorance of most
of the Pastors in those quarters, who might well come to be Catechiz'd themselves, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
much to the obduration of those poor people: but the late King of <hi>Sueden</hi> hath taken
order, therein enjoyning, by a severe Ordinance, the Bishop of the Province, who hath
his residence in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Reuel,</hi> to convocate a Synod once a year, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
of Church affairs, and then to examine, not only the <hi>Recipiendaries,</hi> but also the
<hi>Pastors</hi> themselves, thereby to oblige them to apply themselves to the constant study of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture.</p>
                     <p>It must be acknowledg'd,<note place="margin">Their sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</note> the slavery these people are in is great, and indeed insupportable;
but it is true withall; that upon the least liberty given them, they would break out into any
extravagance. For being perswaded that their Predecessors have been Masters of the Country,
and that only force hath enslav'd them to the <hi>Germans,</hi> they cannot forbear their resentments of
it, and discovering, especially in their drink, if any opportunity of regaining their liberty
should offer it self, a readiness to prosecute it. Of which they gave an evident example, when,
upon the irruption of Colonel <hi>Bot,</hi> the Peasants would side with the Enemy, and head
together, to secure their Masters and deliver them up to the <hi>Polanders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They believe there is another life after this;<note place="margin">Their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life.</note> but their imaginations of it are very extravagant.
A <hi>Livonian</hi> woman, being present at her husband's burial, put a Needle and Thread into the
Grave, giving this reason for it, that, her husband being to meet, in the other World, with
persons of good Rank, she was asham'd he should be seen with his Cloaths rent. Nay, they so
little mind what is to happen in the next World, that in the Oath they take to decide any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
at Law, instead of interessing the salvation of their Souls therein, they are oblig'd to
consider their present and temporal advantages, and so they are sworn, as followeth: <hi>I,</hi> N. N.
<hi>am here present before thee: since thou, O Iudge, desirest to know, and askest me, whether this
Land, on which I now am, is God's and mine with a just title, I swear to God and his Saints,
and accordingly God judge me at the last day, that this Land belongs to me of right, that it is
God's and mine, and that my father hath been possess'd of it, and hath enjoy'd it a long time. And
if the Oath I take prove to be false, I consent, that the Curse of God fall upon my Body and Soul,
upon my Children, upon whatsoever appertains to me, even to the ninth generation.</hi> And to shew
that their Language hath nothing common with any of those, wherewith the most learned
have any acquaintance, we shall here set down the same Oath, word for word, as
they take it.</p>

'Tis the same in <hi>Esthonie;</hi> but about <hi>Riga,</hi> when the Peasants swear at Law, they put a Turf
upon their heads, and take a white stick in their hands, expressing thereby, that they are content,
that they, their Children, and Cattel, may become dry as that Turf, and that stick, if they
swear falsly.</p>
                     <p>These customs favour of their antient Idolatry. The Ministers do all they can to weed it out
of them by little and little: to which end we saw, at <hi>Narva,</hi> the Catechism, Epistles, and
Gospels, with their explications, which <hi>Henry Stahl,</hi> Superintendent of Ecclesiastical affairs
in those parts (a person much esteem'd for his Learning and pains in instructing those <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>)
had caused to be translated and Printed in their Language, to give them some apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Christian Religion. But Idolatry and Superstiton are too deeply rooted in them, and
their stupidity and stubborness too great to give way to any hope, that they will ever be suscepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of instruction. They do their devotions commonly upon hills, or neer a tree they make
choice of to that purpose, and in which they make several incisions, bind them up with some red
stuff, and there say their prayers, wherein they desire only temporal blessings. Two leagues
from <hi>Kunda,</hi> between <hi>Reuel</hi> and <hi>Narva,</hi> there is an old ruin'd Chapel, whither the Peasants go
once a year on Pilgrimage, upon the day of our Lady's Visitation. Some put off their cloaths,
and in that posture having kneel'd by a great stone that is in the midst of the Chapel, they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
leap about it, and offer it Fruits and Flesh, recommending the preservation of themselves
and their Cattel to it for that year. This piece of devotions is concluded with eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all kind of licentiousness, which seldom end without quarrels, murthers, and the like
disorders.</p>
                     <p>They have such an inclination to Sorcery,<note place="margin">Their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</note> and think it so necessary for the preservation of
their Cattel, that Fathers and Mothers teach it their Children, so that there is scarce any Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
but is a Sorcerer. They all observe certain superstitious Ceremonies, by which they think
to elude the effects of it, upon which accompt it is, that they never kill any Beast, but they cast
somewhat of it away, nor never make a Brewing, but they spill some part of it, that the Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
may fall upon that. They have also a custome of rebaptizing their Children, when, during
the first six weeks after their birth, they chance to be sick or troubled with fits, whereof they
think the cause to be, that the name, given them at their baptism, is not proper for them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they give them another; but in regard this is not only a sin, but a crime which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
severely punishes in that Country, they conceal it.</p>
                     <p>As they are stubborn in their superstitions,<note place="margin">Their obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy.</note> so are they no less in the exact observation of
their Customs. To which purpose we had a very pleasant, but true, story, related to us at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>de la Barr</hi>'s, concerning an old Country fellow. Being condemn'd, for faults enormous
enough, to lye along upon the ground, to receive his punishment, and Madam <hi>de la Barre,</hi> pittying
his almost decrepit age, having so far interceded for him, as that his corporal punishment should
be chang'd into a pecuniary mulct of about 15. or 16. pence, he thank'd her for her kindness,
and said, that, for his part, being an old men, he would not introduce any novelty, nor suffer
the Customes of the Country to be alter'd, but was ready to receive the chastisement which his
Predecessors had not thought much to undergo, put off his cloaths, layd himself upon the ground,
and receiv'd the blows according to his condemnation.</p>
                     <p>This is accounted no punishment, but an ordinary chastisement in <hi>Livoniae</hi> For, the people,
being of an incorrigible nature, must be treated with that severity, which would elsewhere be
insupportable. They are not permitted to make any purchase, and to prevent their so doing,
they have only so much ground to manage, as will afford them a subsistence. Yet will they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to cut down wood in some places of the Forests, and, having order'd the ground, sow
wheat in it, which they hide in pits under ground, to be secretly sold. When they are taken
in this, or any other fault, they make them strip themselves naked down to the hips, and to
lye down upon the ground, or are ty'd to a post, while one of their Camerades beats them with
a Switch, or Hollywand, till the blood comes of all sides; especially when the Master says
<hi>Selcke nack maha pexema,</hi> Beat him till the skin falls from the flesh.</p>
                     <p>Nor are they suffer'd to have any money; for as soon as it is known they have any, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and their Officers, who are paid by the Peasantry, take it from them, nay force them to
give what they have not. Which cruelty of the Masters puts these poor people many times into
despair, whereof there happened a sad example. A Peasant press'd by his Officer to pay what
he neither had, nor ought, and being depriv'd of the means whereby he should maintain his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
strangled his Wife and Children, and when he had done hung himself up by them. The
Officer coming the next day to the house, thinking to receive the mony, struck his head against
the man's feet that was hanging, and so perceiv'd the miserable execution, whereof he was the
cause.</p>
                     <p>The Nobility of <hi>Livonia,</hi>

                        </note> especially of <hi>Esthonie,</hi> is free from all charges and taxes. Their
courage, and the services they have done against the Infidels and <hi>Muscovites,</hi> have acquir'd them
this liberty, and most of their privileges. <hi>Volmar</hi> II. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> first gave them Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
to be held by Fealty, which have been since confirm'd by <hi>Eric</hi> VII. who gave them Letters
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47786:32"/>
Patents to that purpose. The Masters of the Order of the <hi>Short Sword,</hi> and the Grand Masters
of the Order of <hi>Prussia,</hi> augmented them. <hi>Conrad de Iungingen</hi> extended the succession of such
Mannors, in <hi>Harrie</hi> and <hi>Wirland,</hi> to the daughters and their issue, to the fifth degree: and
<hi>Gaultier de Plettenberg,</hi> who was chosen Grand-Master, in the year 1495. and acknowledg'd
Prince of the Empire in 1513. absolutely exempted the Nobility of <hi>Esthonie</hi> from all subjection;
excepting only the service which Gentlemen are oblig'd to do in person, upon the accompt of
their Mannors. Once a year there is a review made of them, and that body of Nobility is look'd
upon as a Nursery, that hath furnish'd and still doth furnish <hi>Sueden</hi> with a great number of
Officers, even to Generals of Armies; besides the Noble Cavalry it is able to raise, for the
service of that Crown. The said Nobility came not under the protection of the King of
<hi>Sueden,</hi> till such time as, being forsaken by all their Neighbours, and not able to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their enemies any longer, they were forc'd to make their applications to a forein
Crown, which hath promis'd to secure unto them all the Privileges, they have by their courage
acquired.</p>

judgement. To this purpose is chosen a Gentleman, who hath the quality of Captain of the
Province, and represents to the Governour and Council the grievances of the people, if there
be any, and this employment is not continued in the same person above three years. And
whereas, during the Wars with the <hi>Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Polanders,</hi> private mens Inheritances in

years to three years, who take cognizance thereof, and if any one find himself aggriev'd by
their judgement, he may appeal to the Governour and Council of the Country, who appoint
Commissioners, who having been upon the places in question, do either reverse or confirm the
former Judgement. They have also particular Judges for the High-wayes, which are there ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                        <hi>March</hi> 5. after five leagues travelling, we came to <hi>Narva.</hi> 'Tis a small Town, but strong,
and hath a very good Castle. It is situated at 60 degrees of the Aequinoctial, in the Province of
<hi>Allentaken,</hi> so called from the River <hi>Narva</hi> or <hi>Nerva.</hi> This River rises out of the Lake <hi>Peipis,</hi>
and falls into the Gulf of <hi>Finland,</hi> two leagues below this Town. It is in a manner as broad as
the <hi>Elbe,</hi> but much swifter, and its water is very brownish. About half a league above this
Town, there is a fall of water, which makes a dreadful noise, and is so violent, that break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Rocks, it is reduc'd as it were to powder, which filling the Air affords a strange
sight, by reason that the Sun shining upon it, makes a kind of Rain-bow, no less pleasant than
that fram'd in the Clouds. This fall occasions the unlading of all Merchandizes which pass that
way from <hi>Plescon</hi> and <hi>Derpt</hi> for <hi>Narva,</hi> to be sent into the Gulf of <hi>Finland.</hi> 'Tis said that <hi>Volmar</hi>
II. K. of <hi>Denmark,</hi> built it in the year 1213. <hi>Iohn Basilouits,</hi> G. D. of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> took it in the

on the 6 of <hi>September</hi> 1581. and ever since the <hi>Suedes</hi> have been masters of it. <hi>Nielis
Asserson</hi> was Governour of it, at the time of our Embassy, who was succeeded since by <hi>Eric
Gyllenstierna</hi> Governour and Lieutenant General for the Crown of <hi>Sueden,</hi> in <hi>Ingermania.</hi> It
hath a long time enjoy'd the same privileges with the other <hi>Hanseatick</hi> Towns: but the Wars
between <hi>Muscovy</hi> and <hi>Sueden</hi> had so far destroy'd the commerce of it, that it is within these
few years that there are some hopes conceived of its re-establishment, which cannot encrease
but as that of <hi>Reuel</hi> abates. The War between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> was so much to its
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47786:32"/>
advantage,<note place="margin">1636.</note> that the Commerce of <hi>Archangel</hi> being by that means interrupted, the Ships that
were wont to go to <hi>Muscovy</hi> made use of the Haven of <hi>Narva,</hi> whither there came in the year
1654. above sixty Ships, and took up, there, Merchandizes amounting to above 500000
Crowns. Upon this they took occasion to cleanse and augment the Town, to build new and
regular streets for the convenience of strange Merchants, and to facilitate the passage of Ships
into the Haven. Queen <hi>Christina</hi> of <hi>Sueden,</hi> exempted this City out of the general Jurisdiction
of the Governour of the Province, and gave it a particular Lieutenant, to judge of affairs Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and Ecclesiastical, without appeal to any other place.</p>
                     <p>The Castle is on this side the River, and on the other,<note place="margin">Juanogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod.</note> that of <hi>Iuanogorod,</hi> which the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
have built upon a very steepy Rock, whereof the River of <hi>Narva</hi> makes a peninsula, so
that the place was judg'd impregnable, till <hi>Gustavus Adolphus</hi> took it, in the year 1617. At
the foot of this Castle is a Town called <hi>Narva Muscovite,</hi> to distinguish it from the <hi>Teuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
or <hi>German Narva,</hi> whereof our discourse hath been. This Town is inhabited by natural
<hi>Muscovites,</hi> but Subjects of the Crown of <hi>Sueden,</hi> to which the said <hi>Gustavus</hi> hath also joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Castle of <hi>Iuanogorod,</hi> where <hi>Nichola Gallen</hi> govern'd, at our passage that way, in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

                     <p>The Country between <hi>Reuel</hi> and <hi>Narva,</hi> as also generally all <hi>Ingermania</hi> and <hi>Livonia,</hi> have
in the Woods, a great number of Beasts that are yellowish and black; and among others such
abundance of Wolves and Bears, that the Peasants have much ado to keep them off their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
and themselves. In Winter, when the ground is covered with snow, the Wolves, not
meeting with ought abroad, will come, in the day time, into mens yards, and carry away
the Doggs that keep them, and will break through the VValls, to get into the
Stables.</p>
                     <p>We were told,<note place="margin">A remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able story of a Wolf.</note> that in the year 1634. upon the 24. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> a Wolf, not of the biggest,
had set upon 12. <hi>Muscovian</hi> Peasants, who were bringing Hay to the City. He took the first
by the throat, got him down, and kill'd him; he did the like to the second. He flead the third's
head; eat off the nose and cheeks of a fourth, and hurt two more. The other six got together,
put themselves into a posture of defence, struck down the Wolf, and kill'd him. It was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
discovered, that he was mad, for all those he had hurt dyed so. The Magistrate of <hi>Narva</hi>
had caus'd the skin to be preserv'd, which was shew'd as a thing very remarkable.</p>
                     <p>We were told also that a Bear, finding a Vessel of Herrings, which a Peasant had laid down
at an Alehouse door, fell a-eating of them, and went thence into the Stable, whither the
Peasants follow'd him; but having wounded some of them, the rest were glad to get away.
Thence he went into a Brewhouse, where meeting with a fat of new Beer, he got so drunk,
that the Peasants perceiving he reel'd every step, and at last fell asleep in the High-way, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd
and kill'd him. Another Peasant having turn'd out his Horse a-grazing in the night, found
him next morning dead, with a Bear lying by him, who had fed very heartily upon him. But as
soon as the Bear perceiv'd the Peasant, he leaves the Prey he was already assur'd of, got hold
of the Peasant, and was carrying him away between his paws to his Den; but the Peasants
Dog having got the Bear by the foot, made him let go, and, while they were engag'd, the
Master had time to get up a Tree and save himself.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1634. A Bear digg'd up thirteen Carcasses out of a Church-yard, belonging to a
little Village near <hi>Narva,</hi> and carried them away with the Coffins. Not is it long since that a
Lady of quality in those parts met one carrying away a Carcass, with the shrowd trailing after
it, which frighted the Horse that drew the Lady's Sledge, so as that he ran away with her,
cross the fields, to the great hazard of her life. Many other stories were told us; as that of a
Bear who had kept a Woman 15 days together in his Den, and the manner how she was deliver'd
thence; but we shall forbear any further accompt of them, as relating more to natural History
than Travels. I shall only add, that the Peasants, who are not secure from these Creatures
when they goe but into the fields, especially in the night time, are of opinion, that the
noise of a stick, they fasten to the Sledges, frights the VVolves, and makes them run
away.</p>

                        <hi>March</hi> 7. We left <hi>Narva,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Sarits.</note> The 9. before noon, we got four leagues to <hi>Orlin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Orlin.</note> where
the Interpreter we had sent before, to give notice of our departure from <hi>Reuel,</hi> met us, with
this news, that a <hi>Pristaf</hi> waited for us upon the Frontiers. And whereas many disorders were
crept into our retinue, insomuch that some express'd but little respect to their Superiours, the
Ambassadors caus'd all to come before them, and told them, that being upon their entrance
into <hi>Muscovy,</hi> where they judge of the quality of the Embassy, and the greatness of the Prince
that sends it, by the honour which the Ambassadors receives from those that are about them,
they should be mindful of their duty.</p>
                     <p>We all promis'd not to fail therein, provided we were mildly treated, every man according
to his place and quality. Which the Ambassadors having promised for their parts, we parted
cheerfully, to go and meet the <hi>Pristaf.</hi> We found him in a Wood within a league of <hi>Orlin,</hi>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47786:33"/>
where he stay'd for us, in the Snow, with twenty four <hi>Strelits</hi> about him, and ninety
Sledges.</p>
                     <p>As soon as the <hi>Pristaf,</hi> whose name was <hi>Constantino Iuanouits Arbusou,</hi> had perceiv'd us,
and saw that the Ambassadors were a lighting, he also came out of his Sledge. He was clad in a
Garment of green flower'd Velvet, which came down to his Hams, with a great Golden Chain
crossing over his breast, and an upper Garment lined with Sables. As the Ambassadors advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he also came forward, till that being come up to them, and the Ambassadors having put off
their hats, the <hi>Pristaf</hi> said, <hi>Ambassadors, be uncover'd.</hi> The Ambassadors return'd him answer
by the Interpreter, that he saw, they were uncover'd, whereupon the <hi>Pristaf</hi> read out of a
Paper, That <hi>Knez Peter Alexandrowits Repuin, Weywode of Novogorod,</hi> had sent him, by
order from the Grand Seigneur, <hi>Czaar, and Great Duke Michael Federouits, Conservator of
all the Russes, &amp;c.</hi> to receive the Ambassadors <hi>Philip Crusius,</hi> and <hi>Otton Brugman,</hi> and to
accommodate them with Horses, Carriages, Provisions, and what else were necessary for the
continuance of their Voyage to <hi>Novogorod,</hi> and thence to <hi>Moscon.</hi> After we had return'd
him our thanks, he gave us the precedence, enquir'd how we did, and of the particulars of our
voyage, and causing the Horses to be put before the Sledges, he made us travel six leagues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>The 11. We came to <hi>Novogorod.</hi> At the entrance of the City, the <hi>Pristaf</hi> took precedence
of the Ambassadors, though they endeavour'd to hinder him. But as soon as we were lodg'd,
he desir'd the Interpreter to excuse the incivility he had been guilty of, and to satisfie, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
that what he had done was by express order from the <hi>Weywode,</hi> who would have
done him some ill Office about the Great Duke if he had not obey'd him.</p>

degrees: but at the exact observation I made of it on the 15 of <hi>March</hi> 1636. I found, that, at
noon, the Sun was above the Horizon 33 degr. 45 min. and that the declination of the Sun,
by reason of the Leap-year, because of 55. degr. was 2 degr. and 8 min. which being substra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
out of the elevation of the Sun, that of the Equinoctial line could be but 31 degr. 27 min.
which taken out of 90 degr. there remains but 58 degrees, 23 minutes. Which almost agrees
with the calculation made of it by <hi>Bureus,</hi> some time Ambassador for the Crown of <hi>Sueden</hi> in
<hi>Muscovy,</hi> who puts the City of <hi>Novogorod,</hi> at 58 degrees, 13 minutes. It is seated in a spacious
plain upon the River <hi>Wolgda,</hi> or <hi>Wolchou,</hi> which hath its rise out of the Lake of <hi>Ilmen,</hi> half a
league above this City, and crossing the Lake of <hi>Ladoga,</hi> does, in its way, pass through the
River <hi>Niova,</hi> near <hi>Notebourg,</hi> and by the Gulf of <hi>Finland,</hi> falls into the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea. It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with all sorts of fish, especially <hi>Breme,</hi> which are there excellent good, and very cheap.
But the greatest advantage accrews to this City from this River, is by Commerce. For being
Navigable from its very source, and the Country abounding in Wheat, Flax, Hemp, Honey,
Wax, and <hi>Russia</hi> Leather, which is better dress'd at <hi>Novogorod,</hi> than in any other City of
<hi>Muscovy,</hi> the easiness of the transportation of these Commodities, brought thither not only
the <hi>Livonians</hi> and <hi>Suedes,</hi> who are Neighbours, but also <hi>Danes, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Flemmings,</hi>
who setled themselves there so well, that it was, without dispute, the greatest City for Trade
in all the North. The Hanseatick Towns had an Office of Address in this City, which enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many great Privileges under its Prince, who had no dependance on the Great Duke, was
grown so powerful, that it grew into a Proverb, <hi>Ochto Moschet stoiati protif Bocho dai welik
Novogorod?</hi> Who can oppose God and the great City of <hi>Novogorod?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some would compare it, for greatness, with <hi>Rome;</hi> but they are mistaken. For though it be
called <hi>Weliki Novogorod,</hi> the great <hi>Novogorod,</hi> yet can it not be compar'd to <hi>Rome.</hi> It's not
unlikely, it hath been greater than it is now, not only because it was the greatest for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of any in the North, but also for that all about may be seen the ruins of Walls, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Steeples, which, no doubt, had been part of the City. The number of its Steeples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
yet somewhat more great and noble, than what may be now seen; since that coming to

there, was the most forward to promote his design, and the first rewarded for his pains. For
no sooner was the Tyrant got into the City, but he pillag'd it, so that, at his departure thence,
he carry'd away three hundred Wagons loaden with Gold, Silver, and Jewels, besides the rich
stuffs and other sumptuous moveables, which he dispos'd into other Wagons, and convey'd to
<hi>Moscou</hi> whither he also transported the Inhabitants, and sent <hi>Muscovites</hi> thither in their
stead. But nothing contributed more to the destruction of this Citie, than the bruitish cruelty
of <hi>Iohn Basilouits,</hi> Great Duke of <hi>Muscovy.</hi> This Tyrant, upon a meer suspition he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
of the Inhabitants of <hi>Novogorod,</hi> enter'd the City, in the year 1569. and caus'd to be
kill'd or cast into the River 2770. persons, without any respect of quality, age, or sex, besides
an Infinite number of poor people who were trampled to death by a party of horse. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
sent by the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to this Tyrant, eight years after the taking of the City,
relates in his <hi>Itinerary,</hi> that persons of quality had assur'd him, that there were so many bodies
cast into <hi>Wolgda,</hi> that the River stopping overflow'd all the neighbouring fields. The Plague
which soon follow'd this cruelty, was so great, that, no body venturing to bring in Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Inhabitants fed on the dead Carcasses. The Tyrant took a pretence from this inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to cause to be cut in pieces all those who had escap'd the Plague, Famine, and his former
cruelty, which was no doubt more dreadful than all the other chastisements of God. I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
onely two Examples relating to <hi>Novogorod.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> The Archbishop of this place, having escap'd
the first fury of the Soldiery, either as an acknowledgement of the favour, or to flatter the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
entertains him at a great Feast in his Archiepiscopal Place, whither the Duke fayl'd not
to come, with his Guard about him: but while they were at Dinner, he sent to pillage the rich
Temple of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> and all the Treasures of the other Churches, which had been brought thither,
as to a place of safety. After Dinner he caus'd the Archbishops Palace to be in like manner pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged,
and told the Archbishop, that it would be ridiculous for him to act the Prelate any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
since he had not to bear himself out in that quality; that he must put off his rich habit,
which must thence-forward be troublesome to him, and that he would bestow on him a Bagpipe
and a Bear, which he should lead up and down, and teach to dance, to get mony; That he must
resolve to marry, and that all the other Prelates and Abbots that were about the City should be
invited to the Wedding, setting down the precise sum which it was his pleasure that every one
should present to the new-married couple. None but brought what he had made a shift to save,
thinking the poor Archbishop would have had it. But the Tyrant took all the money, and,
having caus'd a white Mare to be brought, said to the Archbishop; There is thy wife, get up on
her, and go to <hi>Moscou,</hi> where I will have thee entertain'd among the Violins, that thou may'st
teach the Bear to dance. The Archbishop was forc'd to obey, and, as soon as he was mounted,
they ty'd his legs under the Mare's belly, hung about his neck some Pipes, Fidle, and a Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brel,
and would needs make him play on the Pipes. He scap'd with this punishment, but all the
other Abbots and Monks were either cut to pieces, or, with Pikes and Halbards, forc'd into
the River.</p>
                     <p>Nay, he had a particular longing for the mony of one <hi>Theodore Sircon,</hi> a rich Merchant. He
sent for him to the Camp neer <hi>Novogorod,</hi> and, having fasten'd a rope about his waste, order'd
him to be cast into the River, drawing him from one side of it to the other, till he was ready to
give up the ghost. Then he caus'd him to be taken up, and ask'd him what he had seen under
water. The Merchant answer'd, That he had seen a great number of Devils thronging about
the Tyrant's soul, to carry it along with them to Hell. The Tyrant reply'd, Thou art in the
right on't: but it is just I should reward thee for thy prophecy, whereupon calling for seeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oil, he caused his feet to be put into it, and continu'd there, till he had promis'd to pay
him ten thousand Crowns. Which done, he caus'd him to be cut to pieces, with his brother
<hi>Alexis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Baron of <hi>Herberstein,</hi> who travel'd into <hi>Muscovy,</hi> in the time of the Emperor <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imilian</hi>
the first, and about his Affairs, says, that heretofore, before the City of <hi>Novogorod</hi>
was converted to the Christian Faith,<note place="margin">Perun.</note> there was an Idol called <hi>Perun,</hi> that is, the God of
Fire, <hi>perun,</hi> in the <hi>Muscovian</hi> language signifying fire. This God was represented with a
Thunder-bolt in his hand, and hard by him was kept a constant fire of Oak, which was not
to go out, but at the peril of their lives who kept it. The same Author addes, that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Novogorod</hi> having received Baptism, and being made Christians, cast the Idol into
water, that it went against the stream of the River, and that being near the Bridge, it call'd
to the Inhabitants, and casting a stick among them, bid them keep it for his sake; That in his
time, on a certain day in the year, the voice of <hi>Perun</hi> was heard there, and that thereupon
the Inhabitants fell a-fighting with sticks, so earnestly, that the <hi>Weywode</hi> had much ado to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
them. But now there is no talk of any such thing, there being no monument of <hi>Perun</hi>
left, other than that there is a Monastery called <hi>Perumski Monastir,</hi> which they say is built
in the place where the Temple of the Idol stood before.</p>
                     <p>Without the City, and on the other side of the River, is a Castle, encompass'd with a stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47786:34"/>
where live the <hi>Weywode</hi> and the Metropolitan, or Arch-bishop, who hath the over-sight
of Ecclesiastical affairs all over the Province. This Castle joyns to the City by a great Bridge,
from which, Duke <hi>Iohn Basilouits</hi> caus'd a great number of Inhabitants to be cast into the River,
as was said before. Over against the Castle, on the same side with the City, is a Convent,
dedicated to St. <hi>Anthony.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">St. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery.</note> The <hi>Muscovites</hi> say, he came from <hi>Rome</hi> into those parts upon a
Mill-stone, upon which he came down the <hi>Tiber,</hi> cross'd the Sea, and so up the River <hi>Wolgda,</hi>
to <hi>Novogorod.</hi> They add, that, by the way, he met certain Fisher-men, with whom he
bargain'd for the first draught they should make: that they brought up a Chest full of Priests
Vestiments to say Mass in, Books, and Money, belonging to this Saint, and that afterwards
he built a Chapel there, in which they say he lies interr'd, and that his Body is there to be
seen, as entire as when he departed this World. Many Miracles are wrought there, as they
say; but they permit not strangers to go in, thinking it enough to shew them the Mill-stone,
upon which the Saint perform'd this pretended voyage, and which indeed may be seen lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Wall. The Devotions performed there have been such as have built a very fair Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery
in that place.</p>
                     <p>We staid at <hi>Novogorod,</hi> five days, during which the <hi>Weywode</hi> sent us a Present of 24 sorts of
meat, dress'd after their way, and 16 sorts of drink. The Chancellor, <hi>Bogdan Foederouits O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boburou,</hi>
who had been our <hi>Pristaf</hi> in the former Voyage, sent us also divers delicacies. The
Ambassadors presented the <hi>Weywode</hi> with a new Coach.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>March</hi> 16. VVe had brought us 129 fresh Horses for our Sledges, and we got that day four

                        <note place="margin">Wisna wolloka.</note> where we saw a young man of
12 years of age that was married. At <hi>Tuere,</hi> we saw a married woman that was but 11. and
this is ordinary in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> as also in <hi>Finland.</hi> The same night we came to <hi>Windra Pusk,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Windra Pusk.</note>
having travel'd that afternoon seven leagues. In this last place, there were but three houses,
and the stoves so nasty and stinking, that we had a very ill night of it, though indeed in other
places the stoves are not kept much better than stables in our Country.</p>
                     <p>The 21 we got 7 leagues, to <hi>Torsock.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Torsock.</note> The 22. six, to <hi>Troitska Miedna;</hi>

more, to <hi>Tuere,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tuere.</note> mentioned before. Here the snow beginning to melt in several places, we
quitted our Sledges, and took the <hi>Wolgda,</hi> which was still frozen, and travel'd that day six
leagues, to <hi>Gorodna.</hi> The 24. we went by land again, for the Ice began to give way, and got
to <hi>Sawidoua;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sawidowa</note> and thence to <hi>Saulkspas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Saulkspas.</note> seven leagues from our last lodging, having, by the
way, pass'd several Brooks with great difficulty, by reason the Ice was loose. The 25. we
pass'd by a great Village called <hi>Klin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Klin.</note> behind which is the Brook <hi>Sestrea,</hi> which falls into the

which we made a shift to fasten in the Brook, to hinder them from carrying us away. The next
day we pass'd it again, by reason it winds it self up and down in those parts, and lodg'd that
night at <hi>Beschick,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Beschick.</note> seven leagues from <hi>Klin.</hi> The 27. we pass'd two other little Brooks, and

which the Author, in the first Book calls <hi>Nicola Nachinski,</hi> within two leagues of <hi>Moscou,</hi>
where the Ambassadors are wont to expect the Great Duke's pleasure, and the order he would
have observ'd in their entrance. In the mean time we fitted our Liveries, and set our selves
in order for our Cavalcade, which we made the next day at Noon, as followeth.</p>
                     <p>First,<note place="margin">Their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Moscou.</hi>
                        </note> went the 24 Musketiers who had conducted us from the Frontiers, being all <hi>Cosaques.</hi>
After them our Mareschal alone.</p>
                     <p>Then the Officers and Gentlemen, three a-breast, and those of best quality first.</p>
                     <p>Three Trumpetters, with silver Trumpets.</p>
                     <p>Then the Ambassadors, each in his Sledge, having before them six with Carabins, and on
both sides as many, with Partizans.</p>
                     <p>Next the Sledges, came the Pages, and after them, the rest of the retinue on horse-back,
and the baggage, all in very good order. The <hi>Pristaf</hi> took place of the Ambassadors. Being
come within half a league of the City, there met us many Troops of horse, <hi>Muscovian, Tartars,</hi>
and some <hi>Germans,</hi> who having rid about our Cavalcade, return'd to the City. After these
came several other Troops, which divided themselves, and encompassing us on both sides, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
us to the City.</p>
                     <p>About a quarter of a league from the City we met two <hi>Pristafs,</hi> with a very noble attendance,
and the same equipage they had at our former reception. Being come within 20. paces of us,
they sent word to the Ambassadors, that they should alight out of their Sledges, and come to
them. The <hi>Pristafs</hi> neither alighted, nor uncover'd themselves, till the Ambassadors had done
both. They are enjoyn'd to proceed with this reservedness, and to stand very much upon the
grandeur and reputation of their Prince, upon pain of being cast out of favour, which disgrace
is many times attended with whipping or cudgeling.</p>

Our reception was after the same manner as the first time, the more aged <hi>Pristaf</hi> beginning in

the Horse presented himself, made his complement, and brought the Ambassadors, two very
stately Horses, white as snow, and twelve others for the chief of their retinue. From the Gate
to our Lodgings, we pass'd through a double file of Musketiers, to the number of above 3000.
and we were lodg'd in that quarter of the City which is called <hi>Cataigorod,</hi> not far from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
in a stone-house, built by an Archbishop named <hi>Susinski,</hi> who fell into disgrace some years
before, and was banish'd.</p>
                     <p>As soon as we had alighted, there were brought in, from the Great Duke's Kitchin and Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,<note place="margin">Their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note>
all sorts of meats and drinks. And from that time during our stay at <hi>Moscou,</hi> we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
every day, sixty two Loaves, a quarter of Beef, four Sheep, a dozen of Pullets, two
Geese, one Hare, and one Heath-cock, alternately, fifty Eggs, ten pence towards Candles, and
five pence for small things us'd in the Kitchin, one Pot of Sack, eight of Hydromel, three of
Beer, and three small pots of Strong-water. Besides all this, for a common stock, a Tun of
Beer, a lesser Tun of Hydromel, and a Barrel of Strong-water. With this we had, by way of
extraordinary in the week, a <hi>poude,</hi> that is, forty pound of Butter, and as much Salt, three
Pails of Vinigre, two Muttons, and a Goose. This allowance was doubled at our arrival, as also
upon <hi>Palm</hi>-Sunday, <hi>Easter</hi>-day, and the young Prince's Birth-day; but we had them dress'd by
our own Cooks. The house-door was kept by a <hi>Desetnick,</hi> or Corporal, who had nine Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers
about him: but the <hi>Pristaf</hi>'s came every day, to entertain and divert us; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after our first publick Audience, or as soon as we have been so happy as to have seen the
bright eyes of his Majesty the <hi>Czaar,</hi> as they express it, they gave us the same liberty as we
had at our former Voyage.</p>

                        <hi>Arril</hi> 3.<note place="margin">APRIL</note> we had our first publick Audience, to which we were conducted with the same Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
as before, and, in our Cavalcade, we observ'd the same order as we had at our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance;
unless it were, that the Secretary went next the Ambassadors carrying the Credential
Letters upon a great piece of Crimson Taffata. The Musketiers had made a lane from our
Lodging to the Castle, but all could not keep off the people from thronging in to see us.</p>
                     <p>The Courriers went and came, as their custome is, to give directions for our march; to order
it so, as that the Great Duke might ascend his Throne, just at the arrival of the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</p>
                     <p>The Ceremonies of the Audience were as is before mentioned. And the Propositions made
contained only complements, thanks for his Majesties favour, in granting the Ambassadors
a passage into <hi>Persia,</hi> and desires to have some secret conferences.</p>
                     <p>As soon as we were return'd to our Lodgings, came one of the Great Duke's Carvers, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Knez, Simon Petrouits Luon,</hi> with forty dishes of meat from his Majesty, all Fish, fry'd
things, and pulse, it being in their Lent: and twelve pots of several sorts of drinks.</p>
                     <p>The Cloath being layd, and the meat serv'd up, he presented, with his own hand, to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
and those of their retinue, to every one a Gobelet full of a very strong Aquavitae, took
himself a great Vermilion gilt-cup, and drunk the Great Duke's health, then the young Prince's,
and then that of his Highness, obliging all to pledge him. He was presented with a piece of
Plate gilt, and those who brought in the meat had two Crowns a-piece given them.</p>
                     <p>We sate down; but most of the dishes being dress'd with Onions and Garlick, we eat very
little, and sent the rest to our friends in the City. But what we spar'd in meat, we made good
in drink, whereto we were partly encourag'd by the <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassadors, who being lodg'd
near us, gave us the divertisement of their Bagpipes, and Hautbois, and partly by the excellent
Wines, which the Great Duke had sent us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Apr.</hi> 5. we had our first private Audience, with the ordinary Ceremonies, having the same
Commissioners we had in our former negotiation, except the Chancellour <hi>Iuan Tarassouits
Grammatin,</hi> who, by reason of age, had resign'd his charge, which was conferr'd upon <hi>Fedor
Fedorousin Lichozou.</hi> While we were at this Audience, there died at our Lodging one of our
Lacqueyes, who, some few dayes before, having been overturn'd in one of the Sledges, had
been hurt by the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi>'s Cabinet, which fell upon his breast. Being of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
religion, his body was carried to the Church of that Profession, where he had a Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sermon, after which he was buried in the Church-yard belonging to the <hi>Germans.</hi> The
Great Duke sent us for the solemnity of the enterment, a <hi>Pristaf,</hi> and 15. white Horses out of
his own Stables.</p>
                     <p>The 9.<note place="margin">The Palm-Sunday Procession.</note> We had our second private Audience. The 10. being <hi>Palm</hi>-Sunday, the <hi>Muscovites</hi>

the more conveniently see it, having express'd our desires to that purpose, the Great Duke sent
the Ambassadors their ordinary Horses, and fifteen others for their retinue. He order'd also
to be kept for us a place, near the Castle-Gate, whence they drove out the people which had
throng'd in to the number of 10000. The <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassadors were plac'd behind us, in the
little Theatre we have spoken of before.</p>
                     <p>The Great Duke having been at service in our Lady's Church, came out of the Castle with
the Patriarch in very good order.</p>
                     <p>First, came a very large Chariot, made of boards nail'd together, but low, drawing after it
a Tree, on which hung abundance of Apples, Figs, and Grapes. In it were four little Boys
with surplisses, who sung the Hosanna.</p>
                     <p>Then follow'd many Priests, in their surplisses and copes, carrying Crosses, Banners, and
Images, upon long Poles; some of them sung, others cast Incense among the people. Next

Duke, who was most richly clad, with a Crown upon his head, supported by the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Counsellors of State, <hi>Knez Iuan Borisowits Cyrcaski,</hi> and <hi>Knez Alexey Michaelouits
Won,</hi> and led, himself, by the bridle, the Patriarch's Horse, which was cover'd with Cloath,
and made to represent an Asse. The Patriarch, who rid on him, had on his head a round white
Satin Cap, beset with rich Pearls, and about it a very rich Crown. He had in his right hand
a Cross of Diamonds, wherewith he bless'd the people, who receiv'd his benediction with great
submission, bowing their heads, and incessantly making the sign of the Cross. About and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him were Metropolitans, Bishops, and other Priests, whereof some carried Books, others
Censers. About fifty little Boys, most clad in red, put off their Casacks and scatter'd them
along the way: others had pieces of Cloath about an Ell-square, of all colours, which they
laid on the ground, for the Great Duke and Patriarch to pass over. The Great Duke being
come over against us, made a halt, and sent his principal Interpreter, <hi>Iohn Helmes,</hi> to ask af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our health, and went not on till our answer was brought him. This done, he went into the
Church, where he stay'd about half an hour. In his return, he stopp'd again at the same place,
to give the Ambassadors notice that he would send them a Dinner from his own Table: which
yet was not done, but instead thereof, our ordinary allowance was doubled.</p>
                     <p>The honour the Great Duke did the Patriarch in leading his horse, is worth to him 400
Crowns, which the Patriarch is oblig'd to give him. Upon <hi>Pain</hi>-Sunday, the same Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
were observ'd all over <hi>Muscovy;</hi> the Metropolitanes and Bishops representing the person of
the Patriarch, the <hi>Weiwodes</hi> or Governours, that of the Great Duke.</p>

                        <hi>April.</hi> 17. was their <hi>Easter</hi>-day. 'Tis the greatest of all their Festivals, and they celebrate it

Resurrection, as that it puts a period to their <hi>Lent.</hi> The streets were all full of a sort of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who sold Eggs of all sorts of colours, which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> send by way of Present
one to another, for a fortnight together after <hi>Easter,</hi> during which time, when they meet,
they kiss each other, and their salutation is in these words, <hi>Christos wos Chrest,</hi> that is, <hi>Christ
is risen,</hi> whereto the other answers, <hi>Wostin wos Chrest,</hi> that is, <hi>He is risen indeed.</hi> No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
what condition, sex, or other quality soever he be of, dares refuse these kisses, or the
Eggs, that are presented to him. The Great Duke himself hath Presented some to the principal
Counsellors, and Lords of his Court. He is wont also, on <hi>Easter-day,</hi> betimes in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to visit the Prisoners before he goes to Church, and to order every one to have an Egg gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, and some sheep-skin for bestow'd on them, exhorting them to rejoyce, since Christ
dy'd for their sins, and was now truly risen again. That done, he causes the Prison-doors to
be shut again, and goes to his Devotions. Their greatest rejoycings consist in Feasts, and
good Cheer; but especially in debauches, in common drinking-houses, which are full of all
sorts of persons, Men and Women, Ecclesiastick and Laicks, who get so drunk, that the
streets are pav'd with Drunkards. The present Patriarch hath prohibited them, and
order'd that on <hi>Easter</hi>-day no drinking places should be open; but he is not much
obey'd.</p>

They were all on Horse-back, sitting a-stride, cloath'd in red, white Hats on their heads, with
great red bands dangling at their backs, white Scarfs about their necks; they were most
wickedly be-painted.</p>
                     <p>The 17. I was sent to the Chancellor, to speak to him concerning our dispatches. He would
do me the greatest honour I could expect, and order'd, I should be brought in to audience by a
<hi>Pristaf.</hi> That importunate civility cost me two hours attendance in the Antichamber, till a
<hi>Pristaf</hi> was found. The Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor receiv'd me kindly, and dismiss'd me
well satisfy'd. The Table in the Audience Chamber was cover'd with a very rich <hi>Persian</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,

                     <p>We accordingly prepar'd for our departure, got Boats to be provided to carry us upon the

Souldiers, <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi> The Great Duke gave us leave to take them out of his own
Guard, for our security against the incursions of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> which make travelling neer

the King of <hi>Poland.</hi> We went out of the City, to observe their entrance. As soon as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
us, they saluted us very civilly, putting off their Hats, but their demeanour towards the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> was much wanting of respect, never offering to be uncovered. They also oblig'd
the <hi>Pristefs</hi> to alight, and uncover themselves first, saying, they were not there to do the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
any honour, but to receive it from them. There were no Horses out the Great Duke's
Stables at the entrance of these Ambassadors, because another <hi>Polish</hi> Ambassador, had, some
few dayes before, refus'd them, and made use of his own.</p>
                     <p>This other <hi>Polish</hi> Ambassador had been sent to the Great Duke immediately after the defeat

the Great Duke no Present, but the Ambassador gave him, as from himself, a very fair Coach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and yet when the Duke sent him a rich Present of Sables, he refus'd them. Whereupon the
Great Duke sent back his Coach, which the Ambassador being angry at, took that occasion to
tumble the <hi>Pristaf</hi> from the top of a high pair of stairs to the bottom. The Great Duke was so
incens'd thereat, that he sent one to tell the Ambassador, that he knew not, whether this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
of his was according to his Master's order, or that the rudeness proceeded from his
own passion; that if his King had commanded him to do so, patience must be had, till God
enabled him to express his resentment of it, that the event of War was in his hands, and
that another time he might be the more fortunate: but that if he had done this without

'Tis true, that, the Palaces of great Lords, and the Houses of some rich Merchants excepted,
which are of Brick or Stone, all the rest are of Wood, and made up of beams, and cross-pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Firr laid one upon another.<note place="margin">Its build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most of Wood.</note> They cover them with barks of trees, upon which they
sometimes put another covering of Turfes. The carelesness of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> and the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of their house-keeping are such, that there hardly passes a moneth, nay not a week, but
some place or other takes fire, which, meeting with what is very combustible, does in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
reduce many houses, nay, if the wind be any thing high, whole streets into ashes. Some
few days before our arrival, the fire had consumed the third part of the City; and about 5 or 6
years since, the like accident had near destroy'd it all. To prevent this, the <hi>Strelits</hi> of the
Guard, and the Watch, are enjoyn'd, in the night time to carry Pole-axes, wherewith they
break down the houses adjoyning to those which are a-fire, by which means they hinder the
progress of it, with much better success than if they attempted the quenching of it. And that it
may not fasten on other more solid structures, the doors and windows are very narrow, having
shutters of Latin, to prevent the sparks and flashes from getting in. Those who have their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
burnt, have this comfort withall, that they may buy houses ready built, at a market for
that purpose, without the white-Wall, at a very easy rate, and have them taken down, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
and in a short time set up in the same place where the former stood.</p>
                     <p>The streets of <hi>Moscou</hi> are handsome, and very broad, but so dirty, after rain hath ever so
little moisten'd the ground, that it were impossible to get out of the dirt, were it not for the
great Posts, which set together make a kind of bridge, much like that of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> near <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
which bridges, in foul weather, serve for a kind of pavement.</p>
                     <p>The City is divided into four quarters,<note place="margin">Catayro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god.</note> or circuits, whereof the first is called <hi>Catayrogod,</hi>
that is, the mid-City, as being in the midst of the others. This quarter is divided from the
rest by a brick-wall, which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> call <hi>crasne stenna,</hi> that is, red stone. The <hi>Moska</hi>
passes on the South-side of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the River <hi>Neglina,</hi> which joyns with the other behind the
Castle,<note place="margin">Cremele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</note> on the North side. The Great Duke's Palace, called <hi>Cremelena,</hi> and which is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
extent than many other ordinary Cities, takes up almost one half of it, and is fortify'd with
three strong walls, and a good ditch, and very well mounted with Canon. In the midst of the
Castle are two Steeples, one very high, and cover'd with Copper gilt, as all the other Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Castle are. This Steeple is called <hi>Iuan Welike,</hi> that is, the <hi>Great Iohn.</hi> The other
is considerable only for the Bell within it, made by the Great Duke <hi>Boris Gudenou,</hi> weighing
33600. pounds. It is not toll'd, but upon great Festivals, or to honour the entrance and audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Ambassadors: but to stir it there must be 24 men, who pull it by a Rope that comes
down into the Court, while some others are above to help it on by thrusting. The Great
Duke's Palace stands towards the further side of the Castle, with that of the Patriarch, and
appartements for several <hi>Bojares,</hi> who have places at Court. There is also lately built a very fair
Palace of stone, according to the <hi>Italian</hi> Architecture, for the young Prince; but the Great
Duke continues still in his wooden Palace, as being more healthy than stone-structures. The
Exchequer, and the Magazine of Powder and provisions are also within the Castle.</p>
                     <p>There are also within it two fair Monasteries, one for men, the other for women, and
above fifty Churches and Chapels, all built of stone; among others, those of the B.
<hi>Trinity,</hi> St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s, wherein are the Sepulchres of the Great Dukes, and St.
<hi>Nicholas</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>At the Castle-Gate, but without the Walls, on the South-side, is a fair Church Dedicated
to the B. <hi>Trinity,</hi> and commonly called <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> When it was finish'd, the Tyrant <hi>Iohn
Basilouits,</hi> thought it so magnificent a structure, that he caus'd the Architect's eyes to be put
out, that he might not afterwards do any thing that should be comparable to that. Near this
Church are two great pieces of Canon, with the mouths towards that street by which
the <hi>Tartars</hi> were wont to make their irruptions; but these pieces are now dismounted, and
useless.</p>
                     <p>In the spacious place, before the Castle, is the chief Market of the City kept; all day it is
full of people, but especially slaves, and idle persons. All the Market-place is full of Shops,
as also all the streets abutting upon it: but every Trade hath a station by it self, so as the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
intermingle not with the Linnen or Wollen-Drapers, nor Goldsmiths with Sadlers, Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,
Taylors, Furriers, and the like, but every Profession and Trade hath its proper
street: which is so much the greater convenience, in that a man does, of a sudden, cast his eye
on all he can desire. Sempstresses have their shops in the midst of the Market, where there is
also another sort of Women Traders, who have Rings in their mouths, and, with their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
and Turquoises, put off another commodity which is not seen in the Market. There is a
particular street where are sold the Images of their Saints. 'Tis true, these go not under the
name of Merchandise, among the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who would make some difficulty to say they
had <hi>bought</hi> a Saint; but they say, they receive them by way of Exchange or Trucking, for
money: and so when they buy, they make no bargain, but lay down what the Painter
demands.</p>

                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:47786:37"/>
There is yet another place, in this quarter, called the <hi>Hair-market,</hi> because the Inhabitants
go thither to be trimm'd, by which means the place comes to be so cover'd with hair, that a man
treads as softly as if it were on a Feather-bed. Most of the principal <hi>Goses,</hi> or Merchants, as
also many <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Muscovian</hi> Lords have their houses in this first circuit.</p>
                     <p>The second quarter is called <hi>Czaargorod,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Czaargo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod.</note> that is, <hi>Czaar</hi>'s <hi>Citie,</hi> or the <hi>Citie-Royal,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the former as it were in a Semi-circle. The little River <hi>Neglina</hi> passes through the midst
of it, and it hath its particular Wall, called <hi>Biela stenna,</hi> that is, the <hi>white Wall.</hi> In this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is the <hi>Arsenal,</hi> and the place, where Guns and Bells are cast, which is called <hi>Poggana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brut,</hi>
the management whereof the Great Duke hath bestow'd on a very able man, one <hi>Iohn
Valk,</hi> born at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> whom he sent for out of <hi>Holland,</hi> for this reason, that he was the
first who found a way to discharge a Bullet of sixteen pound weight with five pound of pouder.
The <hi>Muscovites</hi> who have wrought under this man, have so well learnt the Mystery of found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that now they are as expert at it as the most experienc'd <hi>Germans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this quarter also there live many <hi>Knez,</hi> Lords, <hi>Sinbojares,</hi> or Gentlemen, and a great
number of Merchants, who drive a Trade all the Countrey over, and Trades-men especially
Bakers. There are also some Butchers shambles, and Tipling-houses, which sell Beer, Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,
and Strong-water, Store-Houses of Wheat, Meal shops, and the Great Duke's stables.</p>
                     <p>The third quarter is called <hi>Skoradom,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Skoradom</note> and includes the quarter called <hi>Czaargorod,</hi> from the
East, along the North-side, to the West. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> affirm, that this quarter was five
<hi>German</hi> Leagues about, before the City was burnt by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> in the year 1571. The lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
River <hi>Iagusas</hi> passes through it, and in its way fails into the <hi>Mosca.</hi> In this quarter is the
Market for Wood and Houses before mentioned; where you may have Houses ready made,
which may be taken asunder, transported thence, and set up any where else, in a short time, and
with little pains and charge, since they consist only of beams, and posts, set one upon the other,
and the vacuities are fill'd up with Mosse.</p>
                     <p>The fourth quarter is called <hi>Strelitza Slauoda,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Strelitza. Slauoda.</note> because of the <hi>Strelits,</hi> or Musketiers of the
Great Duke's Guard, who live in it. It is situated towards the South of <hi>Citarogod,</hi> on the
other side of the <hi>Mosca,</hi> upon the Avenues of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> Its Ramparts and Baltions are of
Wood. The Great Duke <hi>Basili Iuanouits,</hi> father of <hi>Basilouits,</hi> who built this quarter, design'd
it for the quarters of such Soldiers, as were strangers, as <hi>Poles, Germans,</hi> and others, naming
that place <hi>Naeilki,</hi> or, the quarter of <hi>Drunkards,</hi> from the word <hi>Nali,</hi> which signifies, <hi>powre
out:</hi> for, these strangers being more inclin'd to drunkenness than the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> he would
not have his own people, who were apt enought to debauch themselves, to become so much the
worse by the others bad example. Besides the Soldiery, the poorer sort of the people have their
habitations in this quarter.</p>
                     <p>There is,<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Churches and Chapels in <hi>Moscou.</hi>
                        </note> in the City and Suburbs of <hi>Moscou,</hi> a very great number of Churches, Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Chapels. In the former Impression of these Travels, we said, there were above fifteen
hundred; but whereas <hi>Iohn Lewis Godefrey,</hi> Author of the <hi>Archontologia Cosinica,</hi> thinks that
number so excessive, that he sticks not to speak of it as a thing not likely to be true, I must indeed
needs acknowledge, that I was much mistaken, and, now affirm for certain, that where I said
there were 1500. there are above 2000. No <hi>Muscovite</hi> that hath liv'd at <hi>Moscou,</hi> nay no
stranger, any thing acquainted with that City, but will confirm this truth, as knowing, there
is no Lord but hath his private Chapel, nor any Street but hath many of them. 'Tis true, they
are most of them very small ones, and but fifteen foot square; nay, before the Patriarch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
they should be built of Stone, they were all of Wood: but that hinders not, but that
the number of them may amount to what we have said.</p>

<hi>Kam,</hi> which falls into <hi>Wolga</hi> 12. leagues below <hi>Casan.</hi> The Country is woody and barren,
and much subject to the incursions of the <hi>Tartars Czeremisses,</hi> who were the Masters of it, till

                     <p>The Principality of <hi>Bielsk</hi> derives the name from <hi>Biela</hi> its chief City;<note place="margin">Bielks.</note> as does the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

revolted from <hi>Casimer,</hi> son of <hi>Iagellon,</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and became subject to the Great Duke
of <hi>Muscovy.</hi> The <hi>Czaar Basili,</hi> ejected the Duke of <hi>Siberie,</hi> and united the Province to his

called <hi>Novogorod Siebersky,</hi> that is, <hi>Novogorod,</hi> or the <hi>New City of Siberie.</hi> Its other eminent
Cities are <hi>Starodub, Petivola, Czernigou,</hi> and <hi>Bransko.</hi>

                     <p>The Province of <hi>Dwina</hi> is the greatest,<note place="margin">Dwina.</note> and more Northern of all <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
subject to the Duke of <hi>Novogorod.</hi> The River of <hi>Dwina</hi> falls into the white Sea, near
<hi>Archangel.</hi> It is not long since that this Province, which is a hundred leagues in length, had
but one City in it, of the same name seated in the midst of it: but now that the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
have Translated into those parts, the Trade which the English, Dutch, and Hanseatick Towns,
were wont to bring to <hi>Narva,</hi> it is become one of the most considerable Provinces of all <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy.</hi>
The greatest place of Commerce is called <hi>Archangel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Archangel.</note> from the Archangel, St. <hi>Michael,</hi>
and situated at the mouth of the <hi>Dwina,</hi> where it makes the Island of <hi>Podesemski.</hi> The City is
not very great, but of great Trading, by reason of the many Ships that come every year, which
bring thither the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Merchants, especially those strangers that live at <hi>Moscou,</hi> with
the commodities of the Country, to truck for those that are brought thither. The Great Duke
makes great advantages of it; but the Impositions he laies upon all Merchandlses are so great,
that it is not unlikely Strangers will, in time, return to <hi>Narva,</hi> where the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> takes
but two in the hundred, and, to which, navigation is not so dangerous.</p>
                     <p>In the Gulf, which the Sea makes near the mouth of <hi>Dwina,</hi> are three Islands, called <hi>Solof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka,
Anger,</hi> and <hi>Coloua.</hi> There was heretofore in the former of these the Sepulchre of a <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>
Saint, but 3. or 4. years since, the Great Duke caused the Body to be translated thence to
<hi>Moscou.</hi> Some report, that the Great Dukes, Predecessors of him that now reigns, had
hidden a great Treasure there, as being a place inaccessible, by reason of its high and steepy
Rocks.</p>
                     <p>The Province of <hi>Vstiugha</hi> is next to that of <hi>Dwina,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ustiugha.</note> but more Southerly, and was also sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Duke of <hi>Novogorod.</hi> The chief City, of the same name, is so called from the word
<hi>Vst,</hi> which signifies the mouth of a River, as the Latine word, <hi>Ostium;</hi> and <hi>Iugh,</hi> because it
was seated at the place where the River of <hi>Iugh</hi> falls into <hi>Suchana,</hi> from which it is now half a
league distant. Its Inhabitants eat no Bread, but are content with Fish and Venison dry'd in the
Sun. Thence are brought the fairest black-Foxes skins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vologda,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vologda.</note> seated in the Province of the same name, is the only City in all <hi>Muscovy</hi> that hath a
stone wall about it, being the place whither the Great Duke, in time of War, was wont to send
some part of his Treasures. It sometime belonged to the Duke of <hi>Novogorod,</hi> but is now, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Province, re-united to <hi>Muscovy.</hi> The River of <hi>Vologda,</hi> whence it takes its
name, falls, with the <hi>Dwina,</hi> into the white Sea.</p>
                     <p>The Dutchy of <hi>Bielejezoro</hi> is also one of the Northern Provinces of this great State,<note place="margin">Bieleje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoro.</note> but so
full of Woods and Rivers, that it is in a manner inaccessible, unless it be when the Fenns and
Rivers are frozen.</p>
                     <p>The Province of <hi>Petzora</hi> reaches along the frozen Sea,<note place="margin">Petzora.</note> towards the East and North. The
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47786:41"/>
River of <hi>Petzora,</hi> whence it hath the name, falls into the Sea near the Streight of <hi>Weigats,</hi>
below the City of <hi>Pustioziero,</hi> by six several channels. The mountains, which the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
call <hi>Zimnopoias,</hi> that is, the Girdle of the Earth, (the same, as it is believed, as the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
called the <hi>Riphaean</hi> and <hi>Hiperborean</hi> mountains) lye on both sides of it, and afford the best
Sables, and excellent Hawks. The City is but little, and the cold so great in this Province,
that the Rivers are frozen from <hi>August</hi> to <hi>May.</hi> Upon this Province border the <hi>Samoicdes,</hi> a
people we shall have occasion to speak of hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The Province of <hi>Obdorie</hi> derives its name from the River <hi>Oby,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obdorie.</note> which rising out of the great
Lake of <hi>Kataisko,</hi> and running from the East towards the North, falls into the frozen Sea, and
is so broad at the mouth, that with a very good wind a Ship will have much ado to cross from
one side to the other in two days.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Provinces that are subject to the Great Duke,<note place="margin">The source of <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                        </note> we shall give an accompt
of them in the prosecution of our Travels along the River <hi>Wolga;</hi> of which River we shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say by the way, that in the Province of <hi>Rschouie,</hi> two leagues from its chief City, and in
the great forest of <hi>Wolkowskiles,</hi> is the Lake of <hi>Wronow,</hi> out of which rises a River, that, two
leagues off that place, falls into the Lake of <hi>Wolga,</hi> from which it derives its name, and is
thence forward called <hi>Wolga.</hi> The <hi>Tartars</hi> call it <hi>Edel,</hi> and 'tis the same as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calls <hi>Rha.</hi>
'Tis doubtless, the greatest River in all <hi>Europe;</hi> since that from the City of <hi>Nise-Novogorod,</hi>
near which we went into it, out of the River <hi>Ocea,</hi> to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, we have counted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

to the place where the <hi>Occa</hi> falls into it.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Boristhia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> which those of the Country call <hi>Dnieper,</hi> rises out of the same Province,
ten leagues from the Lake of <hi>Fronowo,</hi> near a Village called <hi>Dniepersko.</hi> It divides <hi>Lithuania</hi>
from <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and after it hath taken its course towards the South, where it passes near
<hi>Wiesma,</hi> and thence towards the East, bathing the Cities of <hi>Progobus, Smolensko, Orscha,
Dubrowna,</hi> and <hi>Mohilouw,</hi> it turns again towards the South, and passing by <hi>Kiouie,</hi> by the
<hi>Circasses,</hi> and thence toward <hi>Otzakow,</hi> a City of the <hi>Tartarians</hi> of <hi>Precop,</hi> it falls into the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xine</hi>
Sea.</p>
                     <p>There are,<note place="margin">Dwina</note> in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> two Rivers called <hi>Dwina;</hi> one rises out of a Lake of the same name,
ten leagues from the Lake of <hi>Fronowo,</hi> and the source of <hi>Dnieper,</hi> and falls into the <hi>Baltick</hi>
Sea, below <hi>Riga.</hi> The other rising at the conjunction of the Rivers of <hi>Iagel</hi> and <hi>Sachana,</hi> gives
its name to the Province before mentioned, and falls into the <hi>White</hi> Sea, near <hi>Archangel.</hi> The
Rivers of <hi>Mosca</hi> and <hi>Occa</hi> are pleasant and very considerable; but, they lose their names,
with all the other Rivers in the Countrey, when they fall into those we have before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Muscovy</hi> then being of such extent, as we have said, it is not to be imagin'd, that in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
so distant,<note place="margin">The Air of <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
                        </note> and situated in so different climates, Air and Earth are alike qualify'd every
where. About <hi>Moscou</hi> and the adjacent Provinces, the Air is good and healrhy, so that there
is no talk of the Plague, or any other Epidemical disease. Which was the reason, that in the
year 1654. at the beginning of the War of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> when the Infection made such havock
in that great City, people were the more surpriz'd thereat, in regard the like had not been
known in the memory of man. It was so great, that those were seen dying in the streets, who
thought themselves well enough when they came out of their houses; and all <hi>Muscovy</hi> was so
astonish'd at it, that all the Avenues of <hi>Moscou</hi> were block'd up.</p>
                     <p>The cold is so piercing,<note place="margin">Extremely cold.</note> that no fur can prevent the Nose, Ears, Feet, and Hands from freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and falling. At our first Voyage thither, in 1634. the cold was so sharp, that, in the
great Market-place, before the Castle, we saw the earth open above twenty fathoms in length,
and a foot broad. We could not go 50 steps, without hazard of losing some of our members.
I saw there by experience, what others have left in writing, that spittle froze before it came
to the ground, and water as it dropp'd.</p>
                     <p>I observ'd withal, that the earth is open there in a manner as soon as in <hi>Germany,</hi> and that
the Spring fruits come much about the same time; for the more the earth is cover'd with Snow,
the more it keeps in the heat requisite to promote vegetation. The Ice and Snow together make
the ways so even, that it is much easier travelling there than any where else. For Winter-tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,
the <hi>Muscovites</hi> make use of Sledges, made very low, of the bark of Trees, cover'd
with some coarse kind of Cloath. We lay all along in them, and covering our selves with
sheep-skins, and the Sledges being cover'd with Sack-cloath, or some coarse Cloath, we not
only felt not the cold, but even sweated in the depth of Winter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muscovian</hi> Horses are very low, yet fit enough for this kind of travelling, for being
swift and indefatigable, they will go 8. 10. nay many times 12 leagues without staying by the
way. I have my self travell'd twice from <hi>Tuere</hi> to <hi>Torsock</hi> without any halt by the way.
Hence is it that travelling is so cheap, that a Country fellow shall bring you fifty leagues for
three or four Crowns at most.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:47786:42"/>
If the cold be sharp in the Winter, the heat is no less troublesom in Summer, not proceeding
so much from the scorching rayes of the Sun (which is there in a manner always above the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,<note place="margin">Very hot in Summer.</note>
and makes the day 18. hours long) as occasion'd by the Flies, Wasps, Gnats, and
other insects, which the Sun produces in the Moors and Fens, which take up a great part of the
Country, in such abundance, that night and day they are extremely troublesome,</p>
                     <p>But,<note place="margin">Fertility.</note> the Fens and Forests, which <hi>Muscovy</hi> is well stor'd with, hinder not but the Land they
cultivate is very Fertile. For unless it be about <hi>Mosco,</hi> where the soyl is barren and gravelly,
let them take ever so little pains with their grounds in other places, they will bring forth more
Wheat and Pasture than the Countrey can consume. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> acknowledge, that <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi>
is to them what <hi>Sicily</hi> was sometime to <hi>Rome.</hi> You never hear talk of dearth, though in
the Provinces that have not the convenience of Rivers to transport their Corn, the Inhabitants
manure only so much ground as will afford them a bare subsistence for the present year, not
minding the future, as confident their ordinary increase will never fail them. Thence it comes
that so much excellent ground lies fallow, producing only Hay, whereof they mow no more than
will serve their Cattel.</p>
                     <p>There is so great difference between this soyl,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Muscovy</hi> more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile than <hi>Livonia.</hi>
                        </note> and that of the Province of <hi>Allentaken</hi> in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia,</hi>
though there lies only the River <hi>Narva</hi> between them, that as soon as a man is over he
perceives it. <hi>Muscovy</hi> and the Northern Provinces of <hi>Livonia</hi> have this common with <hi>Inguer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannia</hi>
and <hi>Carelia,</hi> that they sow not their Corn till within three weeks of Midsummer; for
the cold having,<note place="margin">The seed-time.</note> as a man might say, pierc'd to the Centre of the earth, it must have leasure to
unfreeze: but the Wheat is no sooner in the ground but it puts forth, and the heat of the Sun,
which, as we said, is alwayes above the Horizon, advances and ripens it. So that Sowing and
Harvest is all over in two moneths.<note place="margin">Their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.</note> Wherein the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have this advantage over the
<hi>Livonians,</hi> that they put in their Wheat dry, and ready to be thrash'd, whereas the <hi>Livonians</hi>
are forc'd to use fire to dry it, by the help of a great Oven, built in the midst of a Barn, where
they put their sheaves upon beams lay'd a-cross, till such time as the heat hath so dry'd them,
that beating them with a stick, the Grain falls out, so as that there is no need of thrashing or
treading it, as they do in the East. There is yet this further inconvenience, that the Wheat thus
dry'd is not good for seed, and many times the Barns take fire, which spreads into the houses
about them, and consumes all.</p>
                     <p>In those Provinces which are not so much towards the North,<note place="margin">The fruits of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy.</hi>
                        </note> especially neer the City of
<hi>Mosco,</hi> their are excellent fruits, as Apples, Cherries, Plums, and Goos-berries. I have seen
Apples in beauty and colour much like those which are called <hi>Appians,</hi> and so transparent, that
holding them between your sight and the Sun, you may easily tell the Kernels. 'Tis true this
fruit having not time to bake in the Sun, (it being rather a moderate slow heat, than an exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
scorching, that consumes the superfluous moisture) will not keep, as it would do in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
and other more Southerly Countreys: but the Commentator upon the Maps of <hi>Atlas</hi> is
nevertheless mistaken, when he sayes, after the Baron of <hi>Herberstein,</hi> and <hi>Guagnin,</hi> that the
cold is so great in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> that the Countrey cannot produce Apples or other Fruits that are
worth sending up to the Table. They have also all manner of Pulse, Pot-herbs, Asparagus,
Onions, Garlick, Roots, Cowcumber, Citruls, or Gourds, and Melons, and of these last
abundance, excellent good, and so big, that at my being in <hi>Muscovy</hi> in the year 1643. a friend
presented me with a Melon,<note place="margin">Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons.</note> that weigh'd forty pound. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> are very expert in the
ordering of their Melons. They steep the seed, for the space of 48. hours, in Cow's milk, or
an infusion of fair water and Sheep's dung: their beds they make of Horse dung, as it is carried
out of the Stable, six foot deep, and then cover them with the best mold, in which they make
flat Trenches, about a foot and a half broad. They thrust the seed so deep into the bed, as that
it may not only be secur'd from the cold, and receive the benefit of the Sun-shine, but also have
the advantage of the heat which the dung sends up from below, covering it in the night, and
some times all day long, with bells of the Country-glass, or talk. They do not transplant
them, but are careful to take away what is superfluous, and do what other things are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practis'd in other places, about that plant.</p>
                     <p>We were credibly inform'd, that near <hi>Samara,</hi> between <hi>Wolga</hi> and the <hi>Doa,</hi> there is a kind
of Melons, or rather Gourds, that are form'd like a Lamb, whereof this fruit represents all the
members, being fasten'd to the ground by the stalk, which is as it were its navel. As it grows
it changes place, as far as the stalk will give way, and, as it turns, makes the grass to wither.
The <hi>Muscovites</hi> call this browzing, or feeding, adding, that when it is ripe, the stalk withers,
and the fruit is cloath'd with a hairy skin, which may be dress'd and used instead of Furr. They
call this fruit <hi>Boranez,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Boranez.</note> that is to say, the <hi>Lamb.</hi> They shew'd us some of those skins, taken
off the covering of a bed, and swore they came from that fruit, but we could hardly believe it.
They were covered with a soft frizling Wooll not unlike that of a Lamb newly wean'd, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the Sheep's belly. <hi>Iulius Scaliger</hi> makes mention of it, <hi>Exerc.</hi> 181. and sayes this
fruit grows till the grass fails it, and that it dies not but for want of nourishment. He adds, that
no Beast will feed on it, but the Wolf, and that it is us'd as a bait to take him, which the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
also confirmed.</p>

                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:47786:42"/>
It is not long that they have had Flowers and sweet Herbs, the Great Duke <hi>Michael Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouits</hi>
being the first that bestow'd any expence in Gardening, which he did with very good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.<note place="margin">Flowers,</note>
Nor is it long that they have had any other than wild Roses. <hi>Peter Marcellis,</hi>
Commissary from the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> brought the first <hi>Provence</hi>-Roses
thither.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Holand</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Merchants have but lately planted Asparagus there,<note place="margin">Asparagus.</note> which take ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, and are as big as a mans thumb. Nor have the <hi>Muscovites</hi> been long acquainted with
Lettice and other Salad-herbs, and laugh'd at the Strangers who fed on them; but now they
begin to like them. There are no Hazel-trees, nor Vines in <hi>Muscovy;</hi> but the Dutch bring
such quantities of several sorts of Wine thither by the way of <hi>Archangel,</hi> that there is no want
of any. There is also within these few years some brought in from <hi>Astrachan,</hi> upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Muscovy,</hi> abounds in Hemp and Flax; and there is so much Honey and VVax, even
in the VVoods, that, besides what is spent in Hydromel, and in Wax-Candles, in
this Commodity consists the greatest part of the commerce which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have
with Strangers, to whom they put off yearly above twenty thousand Quintals (or hundred
weight) of Wax.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Muscovy</hi> being but a continued Forest,<note place="margin">Venison and Fowl.</note> those places only excepted where they have fir'd
the Woods in order to agriculture, it must needs be very well furnish'd with all sorts of Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
and Fowl. Whence it comes, that Heath-cocks, Feasants of several kinds, and Patrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are very cheap; as also wild Geese, and Ducks; Herons and Swans are not much esteem'd;
much less Thrushes, Fildevars, Quails, Larks, and other small Birds, which the Country
people will not take the pains to look after. There are no Storks in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> nor yet in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia;</hi>
but abundance of Birds of prey, as Faulcons, Tassels, &amp;c. In the more Northerly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
there are white ones, which are much esteem'd because of their ratity.</p>
                     <p>There is all sorts of Venison,<note place="margin">No Deer.</note> Deer excepted; Of Elks and wild Boars abundance. The Hares
are grey, but in some Provinces they turn white in Winter, as in <hi>Livonia;</hi> and yet in <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which is contiguous to that Province, and divided from it only by the River <hi>Dune,</hi> the
Hares change not their colour. 'Tis no hard matter to find the reason of this change, which
must proceed from external cold; since I have known, that, even in Summer, Hares have
chang'd their colour, when they have been kept some time in a Cave.</p>
                     <p>The same Forests breed also abundance of Bears,<note place="margin">Furre.</note> Wolves, Linxes, Tigres, Foxes, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,
and Sables, the skins whereof are the most considerable Traffick of the Country, since
that some years, the <hi>Muscovites</hi> sell to Strangers as many as come to a Million of Gold, besides
what is spent in the Country, or presented to the Great Duke. The most esteem'd Furrs are
the skins of black Foxes, Sibles, Castors, white Bears, Ermins, and Squirrels.</p>
                     <p>The Bears and Wolves do abundance of mischief, and are as dangerous upon the high-ways
as the Robbers. For what we have said of <hi>Livonia</hi> is no less true of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> viz. that, in the
Winter time, they break open houses, and take away peoples Cattle, &amp;c. as we have related
in the second Book of these our Travels. We could add many other stories of these Creatures,
but in regard, they would hardly, for the strangeness of them, be credited, at least by such
as never heard any talk of these things, we forbear. When the <hi>Muscovites</hi> take any of the
Bears Whelps, they tame them, and teach them a thousand tricks, and, in time, come to get
a livelihood by them.</p>
                     <p>The Lakes,<note place="margin">No Carps in <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.</hi>
                        </note> Ponds and Rivers affords all sorts of Fish, Carps excepted, which are not to
be had either in <hi>Muscovy</hi> or <hi>Livonia.</hi> At <hi>Astrachan,</hi> we met with abundance of them,
very large, but tough and unsavory; which is the reason the <hi>Muscovites</hi> make no great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of them.</p>
                     <p>Heretofore there were no Mines in <hi>Muscovy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mines.</note> but some years since there was one found out
near <hi>Tula,</hi> upon the Frontiers of <hi>Tartary,</hi> 120 leagues from <hi>Mosco,</hi> which affords only I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
where the Workmen are such as the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> sent over to the Great Duke. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Marcellis,</hi> a Merchant, born at <hi>Hamborough</hi> hath the management of it, who having
built a Forge in a very pleasant Valley there, which hath a Brook running through it, hath
taken it of the Great Duke, furnishing him every year with a certain number of Iron Bars, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Artillery and Bullets. About 15 year since, information was brought to the Great
Duke <hi>Michael Federouits,</hi> that Gold might be found in a certain Province in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> if any
would be at the expence to dig for it; but he who brought the first news of it, instead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
himself, was utterly undone. Heretofore the <hi>Muscovites</hi> were simple enough to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
these informations, and to advance money upon the propositions that were made thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but for some years past, they have been content to hearken to them; or if they advance
any money, it is upon good security put in by the undertaker. I have seen an example of this in
an <hi>English</hi> Merchant, who was perswaded that Gold would infallibly be found, and upon that
imagination engag'd some of his friends to be answerable to the Great Duke for the money he
should advance. But, after a great expence, to no purpose, he was put in prison, and his friends
were forc'd to pay the mony he had taken up.</p>

Having not seen the more Northerly Provinces of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> as <hi>Dwina, Iugarie, Permie,
Siberie,</hi> and <hi>Samojede,</hi> I should content my self with what I have said of them in the beginning
of this Book: But in regard this last named Province is absolutely unknown to all the rest of
<hi>Europe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Samojede.</note> and that I have had the opportunity to discourse with some <hi>Samojedes,</hi> and to learn
from their own mouths the particularities of their Country, I hope it will not be thought much
if I make a short digression concerning them. Being at <hi>Moscou,</hi> in the year 1643. in the Great
Duke's Antichamber, or <hi>Posolse-Pricas,</hi> staying till a <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassador were come out from
Audience, that I might go in to have mine, I had the convenience to discourse with two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
of the <hi>Samojedes,</hi> who had been sent to the Great Duke with a present of many Elks, and
white Bear-skins, which the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Lords use to adorn their Sledges. I laid hold on this
occasion to enquire of them some part of what I was desirous to know concerning their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of life; which I did with the more ease, in that both of them understood the <hi>Muscovian</hi>
Language.</p>
                     <p>'Tis certain, these people were antiently comprehended under the name of those whom they
called <hi>Schites,</hi> and <hi>Sarmates,</hi> and that they were not called <hi>Samojedes,</hi> till after they became
Subjects to the Great Duke: for that word is <hi>Muscovian,</hi> signifying <hi>Eaters of themselves,</hi> as
being compounded of that of <hi>Sam,</hi> himself, and <hi>Geda,</hi> I eat. They would argue thence, that
these people are <hi>Anthropophagi;</hi> for indeed, they did feed on mans flesh, even that of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd
friends, which they mixt with Venison, which was, and is still their ordinary nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mojede</hi> and <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitia.</hi>
                        </note>
What we have said discovers the difference there is between this Province and that of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogitia,</hi>
which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> call <hi>Samotska sembla,</hi> situated between <hi>Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Livonia,</hi>
and is part of the Kingdom of <hi>Poland;</hi> whereas <hi>Samojede</hi> lies towards the <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
on both sides of the River <hi>Oby,</hi> upon the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Sea, and towards the streight of
<hi>Weigats,</hi> as we said before. I can hardly be perswaded, that it is of the <hi>Samojedes, Quintus
Curtius</hi> would speak, when he sayes that the <hi>Abii</hi> sent their Ambassadors to <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great, and that instead of <hi>Abii</hi> we should read <hi>Obii,</hi> because they liv'd upon the River <hi>Oby;</hi>
but of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who are near the River <hi>Don,</hi> or <hi>Tanais,</hi> which divides <hi>Asia</hi> from <hi>Europe.</hi>
'Tis of them rather than of the <hi>Samojedes,</hi> that Q. <hi>Curtius</hi> might affirm, that they had no Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
nor setled Habitations, but liv'd in Woods and Desarts, shunning the conversation of men,
and that if <hi>Alexander</hi> went thither, he must have Conquer'd impenetrable Forests, Rivers, Ice,
and Snow,<note place="margin">The habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Samojedes</hi>
                        </note> after he had triumphed over the Inhabitants. For though the <hi>Samojedes</hi> have indeed
no Cities, yet are they not <hi>Nomades,</hi> nor change their habitations as the <hi>Tartars</hi> do. On the
contrary, their Cabans or Huts, which are covered vault-wife, are built half under-ground, and
have in the middle a hole, which does not only serve for a Chimney, but also for a door when
the Snow is so high, that they are forc'd to make use of that hole to let in air; Since that the
Countrey being in the Frigid Zone, the Snow, which is there sometimes the depth of a Pike,
makes their doors useless. They have walks under their Huts, by the means whereof they may
visit and converse one with another. And this kind of life is so much the more supportable to
them, for that the Sun going beyond the Line, and leaving them in continual darkness for six
moneths together, the liberty they might have to go abroad would be of no advantage to them.
During this long night, they have no other light than what their Lamps afford them, which is
but a sad and melancholy one, as being maintain'd by the Oyl of a certain fish, of which they
make provision in the Summer. Which Season begins with them, as soon as the Sun comes to
the Aequinoctial line, and, entring into the Septentrional Signs of the Zodiack, melts the
Snow, and brings them a day as long as the night had been tedious. Upon this accompt it is,
that <hi>Olaus Magnus, Alexander Guagnin,</hi> and others, have grounded fables of people that
sleep six moneths of the year, or, as Swallows, and Frogs, die in the beginning of Winter,
and rise up again in the Spring. They do not cultivate the Earth, nor keep any Cattel, which
is, no doubt, because the Earth would not require their pains, and affords no Grass. So that
having no Corn,<note place="margin">Their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment.</note> they have no bread to make; and having no Wool, they are forc'd to Cloath
themselves with what nature and their Countrey can afford them. Their food is fish, dry'd in
the Wind and Sun, Honey and Venison. They are of low stature, their faces large and flat,
wearing their hair very long; they have little eyes, and short legs, and are not much unlike the
<hi>Groenlanders,</hi> of whom we shall have somewhat to say anon.</p>
                     <p>The Cloathing of the <hi>Samojedes</hi> is of <hi>Renes</hi> skins,<note place="margin">Their cloathing.</note> whereof there are abundance in that
Countrey, as indeed there is all over the North. This Creature, which is thought to be
the <hi>Tarandius</hi> of the Antients, is called by the modern Latines <hi>Rangifer,</hi> from the word <hi>Reen,</hi>
by which name the <hi>Laplanders</hi> call it, a beast not known in these parts. 'Tis as big as a Stag,
but somewhat stronger, the hair grey or white, as they are in <hi>Samojede,</hi> having the breast high
with a long and rough hair, the hoof cloven, and the horn so hard, that making an impression
in the Ice, this animal goes as securely as if it were upon the ground, and so swiftly, that it will
run above 30. <hi>German</hi> leagues in a day. The horns are higher than those of the Elk, and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than a Stag's, having two brow-anklers on the forehead, wherewith he breaks the Ice to
get water in Winter. 'Tis a sociable beast, feeding in herds. It is tam'd without any trouble,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47786:43"/>
and is very serviceable, especially in travelling, being set before little Sledges, made like a
Boat, which they draw with incredible force and swiftness.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Samojedes</hi> wear very large Caps, made of fur, or pieces of Cloath of several colours,
which they buy of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> and are so big that they fall down to their necks. Their
shirts are made of the skins of young <hi>Renes,</hi> which are very soft, and have a short hair. They
wear drawers under their shirts, and upon their shirts, Garments falling down to the mid-leg,
border'd below with a very long fur. These Garments are made like those which are called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saques,</hi>
open only at the neck. Their Mittens are fasten'd to the end of their sleeves, and the
fur of all their Cloaths is turn'd on the out-side. When the cold is extraordinary, they put
their Cosaques over their heads, and let the sleeves hang down, their faces being not to be seen,
but at the cleft which is at the neck.<note place="margin">The error of certain Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</note> Whence some have taken occasion to write, that in these
Northern Countreys, there are people without heads, having their faces in their breasts. As
also that there are some have feet so big, that one of them shades the whole body, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cover'd themselves with their feet, neither Sun nor Rain can come at them. But the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
came thus, that the <hi>Samojedes,</hi> as also the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and <hi>Finlanders,</hi> wear a kind of
shooes or patins, in the Winter time, to go upon the Snow, which are an Ell and a half long
towards the Toe. The <hi>Finlanders</hi> and <hi>Laplanders</hi> make them as long towards the Heel as the
Toes, and call them <hi>Saksit;</hi> but the <hi>Samojedes</hi> do not lengthen them at all towards the heel, and
call them <hi>Nartes.</hi> All make them of barks of Trees, or some very thin Wood, and use them
with a strange agility. Colonel <hi>Port,</hi> Governour of <hi>Narva,</hi> who had many <hi>Finlanders</hi> among
the Soldiers of his Garrison, would needs give us the pleasure of seeing them, when we pass'd
that way, having order'd them to run down a Hill near the City, which they did with such swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that a horse at full speed would hardly have overtaken them.</p>
                     <p>The Nerves and Veins of the <hi>Rene</hi> serve for Thread, among the <hi>Samojedes,</hi> to sow their
Cloaths; their Boots they make of the same stuff, and after the same manner. They scrape the
in-side of the bark of Beech, and what comes off is as fine as the shavings of Parchment or Ivory,
and very soft, and serves them instead of Handkerchers. They take a handful of it, and wipe
their hands, faces, or noses therewith.</p>
                     <p>The Relations of the second Voyage which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made towards the North, in the
year 1595. give the same account of the <hi>Samojedes</hi> as we do, and say, that some of their men

<hi>Samojedes,</hi> so accoutred as we have describ'd them. They at first took them for <hi>Savages,</hi> and
were confirm'd in that opinion by the posture into which the <hi>Samojedes</hi> put themselves, making
ready their Bows and Arrows, to shoot at the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> but the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Interpreter,
which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had with them, having told them they were friends, and that they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to be afraid of them, they laid down their Arms, came up to them, and discover'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particulars of their Country. They were much taken with the civility of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and
one of them took a Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ket that was presented to him; but he betray'd much distrust in the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it; especially, when they heard a Musket shot, towards the Sea-side, though far enough
from them, they were so frightned, that it was no easie matter to satisfie them, that they
were far enough from any danger.</p>
                     <p>I had the curiosity to ask one of those <hi>Samojedes,</hi> what he thought of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were a better Country than theirs, and the <hi>Muscovian</hi> manner of Life, the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.
He answer'd, that <hi>Muscovy</hi> was indeed a pleasant Country, and the provisions of it not
to be disliked; but that their Country also had those conveniences and pleasures, that were
not to be had elsewhere, such as were so inviting, that he was confident, if the Great Duke
had once a tast of them, he would leave <hi>Moscou,</hi> and come among them, to enjoy the security,
quiet, and delightfulness of their manner of life. They were, till within these few years, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
and Idolaters, insomuch as when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made the Voyage I spoke of there, they
found the Sea-side <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

not suffer one of them to be carried away. But they have been since baptized, and have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
Christian Religion, by the means of a Bishop of <hi>Vladimer</hi> which the late Great Duke
sent among them, with some Priests, to instruct them.</p>

as well in regard of the consonancy there is between the people of that Country and those
he had now spoken of, and also the <hi>Tartars,</hi> of whom he will have occsion to speak hereafter,
as for that he hath seen, and discoursed with, some Inhabitants of <hi>Groenland,</hi> who have told

that could be said of a Country, which is as little known, as those parts of the World that
have not yet been discover'd. The Treatise he hath publish'd upon this Subject is such, that

                        <hi>Frederick</hi> III. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> coming to the Crown, in the year 1648. had, besides all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Royal Vertues, a great desire to advance the Trade of <hi>Groenland. Henry Muller,</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
General of the outland customs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> a curious person and rich, undertook it, and,
to that end, set out a Ship in the year 1652. commanded by Capt. <hi>David Dannel,</hi> one of the
most experienc'd Masters of his time. The first Voyage having had the success was expected
from it, the said <hi>Muller</hi> sent him again to <hi>Groenland</hi> the next year, 1653. But as men of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
how curious soever they may be, are carried away with some other predominant passion,
there was nothing learnt in these two Voyages, at least those employ'd in them neglected to
make any relation thereof that ever could be seen: but in the year 1654. a Ship was set out,
which going from <hi>Copenhagen</hi> in the beginning of the Spring, arriv'd not on the Coasts of
<hi>Groenland,</hi> till the 28 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> at a place where the mountains were still cover'd with snow,
towards the shore the waters frozen, and the bottom so hard, that it being impossible the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
should fasten, they were forc'd to let the Ship float upon the water, because there were
Rocks all about. As soon as this Ship appear'd upon the Coasts of <hi>Groenland,</hi> the Inhabitants
set out above a hundred Boats, and came to view that strange structure, which was much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from what they ordinarily saw. At first they would by no means come near it, but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they were intreated to come into the Ship, they at last came, and in a few days were so
familiar, that with their commodities, which they truckt for such toies as we had, they
brought also their Wives, out of an intention to make advantage of them by another kind of
Commerce, which though it be not less known elsewhere, yet is not so publickly practis'd as
among them, where fornication is neither crime nor sin.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> thought this freedom of the <hi>Groenlanders</hi> a good opportunity to carry away some
of them. The Ship being ready to set sail for its return, and the Savages coming still aboard
with their Commodities, a VVoman that had a great mind to a pair of knives which one of the
Sea-men wore at his G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e, offer'd him for it a Sea-Dogs skin, which the Sea-man refusing
as too little, she proffer'd him a kindness into the bargain. The Sea-man had no sooner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
his being well satisfy'd with the proffer, but she begins to unty the point (for they as
well as the men wear Drawers, and would have laid her self down upon the Deck. But the Sea-man
made her apprehend that he would not have all see what they did, and that she must go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Deck. The Woman, having got her Father's leave, follow'd the Sea-man with two other
aged Women, a young Boy, and a Girl of about 12 years of age, who were to be present at
the consummation of the bargain. But as soon as they were down, the hatch was shut, they
laid hold also of another Man, and set sail. The Savages perceiving they were trappan'd, made
a hideous noise in the Ship. Those who were upon the Deck got into their Boats, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Ship a great way into the Sea, to see if they could recover the Prisoners. The Boy,
who went down with the Women; got out at one of the holes the Cable is put out at, and
swam ashore. They also sent back one of the Women, as being too old to be transported; so
that they had but four persons, one Man, two Women, and a Girl. The trouble they were in
to be among people they knew not, was extraordinary; but at last, the kindness and good
cheer wherewith they were entertain'd, won their hearts, together with the hope they were
put into, that within a short time, they should be brought back again into their Country: so
that when they came to <hi>Bergues</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> their affliction seem'd to be quite over, nay, the
Man thought the Women of the Country so handsome, and was got into so good a humour,
that, a Lady of quality being come out of curiosity to see these Savages, he proffer'd to try
what she had under her apron. This man dy'd in the Ship before we came to <hi>Denmark.</hi> His
Daughter seeing him in the agony of Death, bound up his head in his Casaque, and so let him
dy. His name was <hi>Ihiob,</hi> aged about 40 years. The older of the two women, aged about
45 years, was called <hi>Kuneling;</hi> she by whose means they were taken, was about 25. her name
<hi>Kabelau,</hi> and the Girls name was <hi>Sigoka.</hi> The Plague then very rife all over <hi>Denmark,</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
the King to retire to <hi>Flensbourg,</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Holstein,</hi> where these <hi>Groenlanders</hi> were
presented to him. He boarded them at a Chirurgeons, and order'd them to be well entertain'd,
as that at their return to <hi>Groenland,</hi> whither he intended to send them with the first opportunity,
they might have occasion to celebrate the liberality of his Majesty, and the civil entertainment
of his Subjects. The King honour'd the Duke my master so far, as to send them to him to <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp,</hi>
where they were lodg'd in my house for some days, which I spent in sifting our their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and manner of life.</p>
                     <p>They were all three low of stature,<note place="margin">Of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</note> but strong, being well proportion'd in all parts, save
that their faces were somewhat too broad, and their eyes little, but black and very lively, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the more aged of the two women and the Girl, their hands and feet short, in all things
else like the <hi>Samojedes,</hi> or <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Nagaia,</hi> save that they were beyond comparison much
more black, those being of a brown Olive-like colour, their bodies much more swarthy than
their faces, and their skins much softer than those other people we have spoken of. The third
whose name was <hi>Kabelau,</hi> was not so black as the two others. Her eyes were also bigger, and
she discover'd more wit, subtilty, and compliance, than the other two. We conceived she
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47786:44"/>
might be descended of those antient Christians, who some time lived in <hi>Groenland,</hi> in that she
was observ'd to have somewhat of Religion in her, or rather a particular Superstition, by the
aversion she had for flesh, which the other two did eat, such as that of those Beasts, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
held unclean, are not eaten in <hi>Europe.</hi> Their hair was blacker than Jet, and having roll'd
it up together they bound it up on their crowns. As soon as their Maids become marriageable,
they make several blew strakes in their faces, as the <hi>Americans</hi> do. These strakes reach from
the lip to the chin, or they are drawn larger at the upper end and above the nose, between the
two eyes; nay there is one divides it self and reaches over the eye-brows into the Temples,
where it ends with a little branch. These marks they make with a very small thread steep'd in
Train-oil,
or some other black fatness, which being brought between the flesh and the skin,
leaves a mark, which through the skin seems blewish, much like the veins in a smooth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
complexion. They shew'd me that their ears had been holed through, and that they were
wont to wear Pendants in them. Their breasts were very unhandsome, the nipple black as a coal,
and the Breasts flagging and falling down upon their bellies, wherein the Girl had no advantage
of the other two. They suckle their Children, whom they carry on their backs, over their
shoulders. I have been told by those who have long observ'd them, that they have no hair any
where but on their heads, and are not troubled with womens monthly diseases.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Groenlanders</hi> speak fast,<note place="margin">Their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note> and from the throat, somewhat like the <hi>Tartars,</hi> especially they
they pronounce very roughly the words that have a <hi>G.</hi> in them. They have no <hi>R.</hi> in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and when they are oblig'd to pronounce it, they turn into <hi>L.</hi> 'Tis true, among so
many words as their language consists of, there are some <hi>Danish,</hi> but very few; the rest have
nothing common with the languages that are either spoken, or learnt, or known in <hi>Europe;</hi>
unless it might be said that the word <hi>Keiling</hi> comes from <hi>coelum, ilioun,</hi> from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>,
as signifying the same thing. It may be said also that the word <hi>Igne</hi> is <hi>Latiue,</hi> but among all the
rest, we shall hardly meet with three or four that any way relate to any other language. And
to the end the Reader may himself judge, we will furnish him with some of those which are most
common in ordinary conversation.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Groenlanders</hi> call those of their Countrey <hi>Inguin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their cloathing.</note> and strangers <hi>Kablunassouin,</hi> and Cloath
themselves with the skins of Sea-dogs, and Sea-calves, and Renes, much like the <hi>Samojedes.</hi>
They wear under their Cloaths Wastcoats, of the skins of birds, as Swans, Geese, wild Ducks,
and Teals, turning the feathers either inward or outward according to the seasons. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Sex is not easily discover'd, unless it be that the Women are known by a piece of skin
that hangs down before and behind to the half-leg, and by the capuche of their Wastcoats,
which is made like that of the <hi>Recollects,</hi> and large enough to hide their hair, whereas that of
the men is narrower, and cut like that of the <hi>Franciscans.</hi> The mens breeches come down to
their knees, and sometimes lower; but those of the women are shorter, and hardly cover half
the Thigh.</p>
                     <p>They live by hunting and fishing,<note place="margin">Their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises.</note> and make use, in these two exercises, only of Bows and
Arrows, which are the only Arms they have. They have also a kind of hook, which they call
<hi>Karlusa,</hi> made of the tooth of the fish <hi>Towak,</hi> which some would have thought the Unicorn's
horn. Of this bone they make also the instrument they use in Whale-fishing, at which they are
very expert, taking that Creature much after another manner than is done by the <hi>Biskayans,</hi>
and others who drive that trade. To that end, they have a very long thong, cut out of a Whale's
skin, and fasten to one end of it the said instrument, which they cast at the Whale, and at the
other the skin of a Sea-Calf or Dog blown up, which floating upon the water, discovers the
track of the wounded Whale. If she be not mortally wounded, they pursue her, and Dart two
or three times more at her, with the same kind of instrument, till such time as bloud and
strength failing her, they come up, kill her, bring her ashore, and divide her. The Whales fat
is one of their greatest dainties, but especially the Oyl, which is their best sawce, and the drink
they best love. Their ordinary drink is only water; the Women I have seen, would never
drink any Wine, nor eat of our bread, or sawces: for having no Salt, Spice, Sugar, nor Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar
in their Countrey, it is not to be wondred that we could not bring them to like meats
dress'd after our way. Yet do they not eat their meat raw, as some would perswade, but
dress'd, either by boyling or roasting. 'Tis true, they love dry'd Haberdine, or Stockfish, and
sometimes eat it raw; but that is not extraordinary even in <hi>Germany,</hi> where I have seen, at a
desert at the Duke of <hi>Wolfembuttel's,</hi> Gammons of Bacon, and dry'd Salmon serv'd up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyl'd.
Their ordinary food, are Sea-Dogs, and Calves, Renes, Foxes, Hous-Dogs, and Fish.
When they eat, with one hand, they put a piece of the flesh into their mouths, and with the
other cut off what they cannot get in, so that the bits being as much as their mouths can hold,
they make very strange faces to get it down.</p>
                     <p>Their way of living is so different from what is seen elsewhere,<note place="margin">They are <hi>Savages.</hi>
                        </note> that it is no injury to call them
<hi>Savages.</hi> They have no discretion, civility, vertue, or shame. Their countenances are ever
frowning, and they very seldom laugh: they are timerous and distrustful, and withall insolent,
stubborn, and indisciplinable. They are very nasty, and their Tongues serve them for Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchers,
as well for their Cloaths as their Bodies, so that they may very justly be said to live
like beasts. Which yet admits of some distinction, according to the situation of several parts of
the Countrey, it being certain, that the <hi>English</hi> Pilot, who went from <hi>Denmark,</hi> with <hi>Godtske
Lindenau,</hi> of whom Mr. <hi>Pereire</hi> makes mention, and who took his course more towards the
South-west, met with a people much more docile, and less Savage, than that which <hi>Lindenau</hi>
met withall towards the North. Our three women, who had been taken at the entrance of
<hi>Davis</hi>-streight, were rational enough, and easily learnt what they were taught. One of them
imitated pretty well a head or hand, I was drawing with a piece of Charcoal, and the other
came in a short time to do those things, which women and maids ordinarily employ themselves
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47786:45"/>
about in our parts. They danc'd after a strange manner, but with such exactness as to time and
cadence, that the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> having a Ball danc'd at <hi>Flensbourg,</hi> would needs bring in
those three <hi>Groenlanders,</hi> who came off very hansomly, to the satisfaction of all: But they
would never be got to learn our language, though they pronounc'd the <hi>Danish</hi> and <hi>German</hi>
words dictated to them very distinctly.</p>
                     <p>There is no money in the Country,<note place="margin">The <hi>Groen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> have no Gold nor Silver in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> being yet so happy as not to know the value of Gold and
Silver. Iron and Steel they most esteem, and prefer a Sword or a Hatchet before a Golden Cup,
a Nail before a Crown piece, and a pair of Cisers, or a Knife, before a Jacobus. Their trucking
is thus; they put all they have to sell together, and having pick'd out among the Commodities
that are brought to them, what they like best, they put them also together, and suffer those they
deal with to add or diminish till such time as they are content with the bargain. What they
most value, are Knives, Cisers, Needles, Looking-glasses, Iron and Steel; and the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
they sell are the fat and Oyl of Whales, the skins of Sea-dogs and Calves, the Horns, or
rather the Teeth of the Fish <hi>Towak,</hi> whereof Mr. <hi>Pereire</hi> makes a large and true description, in
his Treatise of <hi>Groenland.</hi> It is granted, to be an excellent Antidote against poyson, but it is
long since men have been undeceiv'd in the opinion they had of it. The Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> hath
one that is eight foot and two inches long, and weighs eighteen pound: but the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>'s
is six inches longer. There is also in <hi>Groenland</hi> Talk, and Marble, white, and of all
other colours, and it hath been argu'd from the vapours which were seen rising out of the earth,
at the place where the <hi>English</hi> Pilot came ashore, that there are Mines of Sulphur. It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
also, that in the time of <hi>Frederick</hi> II. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> some Oar was brought thence,
whereof the hundred weight yielded twenty six Ounces of Silver; which is the more credible,
in that it is certain, the more Northerly parts of the Countrey produce both Gold and Silver,
since there hath been seen at the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s, a Wedge of Silver of sixty Marks, which
had been taken out of the Mines of <hi>Norway.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the <hi>Groenland</hi> Religion,<note place="margin">Are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</note> I must confess I could never have any accompt; but it is most
likely they are Pagans and Idolaters, for we have in our custody an Idol, which we bought out
of the Study of Doctor <hi>Paludanus,</hi> a Physician at <hi>Enck-huysen,</hi> who had fasten'd a Note to it,
expressing it's being found at <hi>Davis</hi>-streight. And indeed, our <hi>Groenland</hi> women presently knew it
and called it <hi>Nalim-qui-sang.</hi> 'Twas very roughly made, of a piece of Wood a foot and a half
long, cover'd with Feathers and a hairy skin, having about the neck Sea-dogs Teeth. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would make me understand, that the Children were wont to dance about those Idols; and
our <hi>Groenland</hi> women were seen in fair mornings to prostrate themselves and weep, at sun-rising;
whence it is to be inferr'd, that those people adore the Sun. <hi>Zeiler,</hi> in his Itinerary, says, that
the <hi>Groenlanders</hi> are for the most part Sorcerers, and sell Winds, as the <hi>Laplanders</hi> do:
but that's more than the <hi>Danes</hi> have observ'd in their Voyages. Only it was noted among those
that were in <hi>Denmark,</hi> that when any of them fell sick, one of the Camerades lay down upon
his back by him, and the sick person sitting up bound about his head who ail'd nothing, putting
a stick between the forehead and the cloath that bound it, the other raising up his head, so as
that the sick person might, at first, think it light, afterwards heavy, pronouncing and mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certain words. After which he begun again, and he who had his head bound up, leaned it
down very heavy at first, afterwards more lightly, the sick person still continuing his prayers
and imprecations; none being able to guess at the mystery of this Ceremony. They have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Magistrate nor Superiour among them; their condition is equal in all things, only he that
hath most Children, most Bows and Arrows, and kills most Wildfowl, is the richest and most
considerable among them.</p>
                     <p>For the colour of these people,<note place="margin">Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Septentrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</note> it might be admir'd that in the coldest Climate in the World,

                        <hi>Pliny</hi> saies be true, that it
is the heat of the Sun that burns the skin, and makes the hair curl, and that cold whitens the
skin, and makes the hair of an Ash-colour. But we find the contrary by experience, not only
in the people we have spoken of, but also in those who live at the <hi>Magellan</hi> Streight, who are
white, though as near the Sun as the Negroes of <hi>Africk.</hi> The Inhabitants about the <hi>Cape of
good Hope,</hi> are black, and yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> as also the <hi>Persians,</hi> who are in the
same degree, are white. The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> are but of a duskish colour, and the <hi>Malabares</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Isle of <hi>Cedon,</hi> who are equally distant from the Line, are black. In like manner,
all over <hi>America,</hi> there are no <hi>Blacks,</hi> but only at <hi>Quaerca,</hi> though that vast part of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
reaches from one Circle to the other, through all the Climates of the World. 'Tis no
more than conjecture to say, that this diversity of colours proceeds from certain qualities of the
Country and Air, whereof the causes are not known. Nor is there any more certainly to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that that colour in the skin proceeds from the constitution of the body, since that in any
Climate whatsoever, the conjunction of a Black Man and White Woman shall produce a swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Child, or of such a colour as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Mulatas;</hi> which is so much the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
in that the Sun does not alwayes blacken, but on the contrary, whitens some things, as
Wax and Linne: it being also known, that the Sun makes a picture look more lightsome, and

that the <hi>Portuguez</hi> expose their hair thereto, to take off somewhat of their dy. But to give a
more Christian accompt thereof, it may be said, with the Learned Mr. <hi>Bochart,</hi> in his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<hi>Phaleg;</hi> That the black colour is a mark of the curse in the posterity of <hi>Cham,</hi> which
spread it self in these places of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> where the Negroes live.</p>
                     <p>But it is time we return to our <hi>Muscovites,</hi> whom we shall consider, first, in relation to their
habit and stature, then to that of their humour and manner of life.</p>
                     <p>They are for the most part corpulent, fat, and strong, and of the same colour as other <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropaeans.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The stature of the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites.</hi>
                        </note>
They much esteem great beards (when the mustaches hide the mouth) as also great
bellies; so that those who are well furnish'd about the mouth, and have good fat paunches, are
very considerable among them. The <hi>Goses,</hi> or Great Duke's Merchants, whom we found in
the Antichamber, when we were brought to our publick Audience, had been chosen particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
for those two perfections, for the greater honour of their Prince.</p>
                     <p>The great Lords shave their heads; persons of lower condition cut their hair, and Priests, and
others belonging to the Church, wear their hair so long, that it hangs down over their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to half their backs. Those Lords that are out of favour at Court, let their hair grow and
hang negligently about their heads, thereby expressing their affliction; no doubt after
the example of the antient Greeks, whom the <hi>Muscovites</hi> are apt to imitate in all their
actions.</p>
                     <p>The Women are well proportion'd, neither too big, nor too little; having passable good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">The Women paint.</note>
but they paint so palpably, that if they laid it on with a brush, and had a handful of meal
cast in their faces when they had done, they could not disfigure themselves as much as the paint
does. But the custom is so general, that the most handsome must comply, lest they should
discred it the artificial beauty of others: whereof we saw an example in the wife of <hi>Knez Iuan
Borissowits Cirkaski,</hi> who was the handsomest Lady of all <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and was loath to spoil with
painting, what the rest of her Sex took so much pains to preserve thereby: but the other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
inform'd against her, and would not be quiet, till their husbands had forc'd that Prince to
give way that his wife might dawb her face after the ordinary manner. So that painting is so
common in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> that when any are to be married, the Bridegroom, that is to be, sends
among other Presents some paint to his Bride, as we shall see anon when we come to speak of
their marriages.</p>
                     <p>Married Women put up their hair within their Caps or Coifs,<note place="margin">Their habit</note> but the Maids let their;
hang down their backs in two tresses, and tye it at the ends with a piece of Crimson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silk.
Children under 10 years of age, as well Girls as Boys, have their hair cut, all except
two mustaches which are left over the temples; so that there being no difference in their habits,
that of their Sex is discovered only by the brass or silver Rings, which the Girls wear in their
ears.</p>
                     <p>Their habit is somewhat like that of the antient Greeks. Their shirts are broad, but so short
that they hardly cover the thighs. They are not gather'd at the neck, but lin'd with a triangular
piece from the shoulders to the reins, which piece is sow'd down with Crimson silk. Some have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Armpits, and in the seams, a fringe of silk of the same colour. The more rich have the neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
which is an inch broad or better, the end of the sleeves, and the breast, embroider'd with
silk of several colours, and sometimes Gold and precious stones, and leave open so much of their
Wast-coats, that the embroidery and the two great Pearls, or buttons of Silver or Gold, which
fasten the shirt before, may be seen. Their Breeches are large, and gather'd towards the waste,
so that they may be made larger or streightned, as our Drawers. Upon these they wear a kind
of VVastcoat, which they call <hi>Kaftan,</hi> reaching to the knees, with the sleeves so long, that
they cannot thrust their hands through without making many folds upon the arm. The Collar
of this Wastcoat is above half a quarter both in height and bredth, so that it covers the head
behind. And because that is very much seen, the better sort face it with Plush or Satin. Upon
the <hi>Kaftan</hi> they wear a close Coat, which falls down to the mid-leg, and is called <hi>Feres.</hi> These
are adorn'd with cotton; and indeed, both the <hi>Kaftas</hi> and <hi>Feres</hi> are made of Cotton, Taffeta,
Damask, or Satin, according to their quality who wear them. VVhen they go abroad they
put on a Garment that reaches down to their heels, made of a violet colour, or dark green
cloath, with buttons behind, down to the bottom. Those of the <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojares</hi> are made
of Damask, Satin, or other rich stuff. Of this last kind are all the cloaths taken out of the
Great Duke's VVardrobe, for those persons by whom he is attended at publick cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
                     <p>Their <hi>Feres,</hi> or <hi>Hongrelines,</hi> or close Coats, have a very broad Collar, falling down upon
their shoulders, with loop-buttons of Gold and Silver, nay some with embroidery at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
places before, and the sides. The sleeves are as long as the Coat it self, but narrow; so
that when it is on, they hang down, and have this convenience that they serve to hide a
cudgel, or stones, wherewith they many times surprize and kill those, whom they intend
to rob.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Muscovites</hi> wear Caps instead of Hats. The <hi>Knez, Bojares,</hi> and Ministers of State,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47786:46"/>
have them of black-Fox skins, or Sables, half an ell high, when they are present at any publick
Ceremonies; but in their houses, and about the City, they are of Velvet, lined with the said
Furrs, but with narrow brims, layd all over with buttons and loops of Gold and Silver, or
embroider'd with Pearls, The common People, in the Summer time, wear Caps of some coarse
stuff, and in-Winter, of cloath, lin'd with Sheep skins, or some ordinary Furr. Their boots
are short, as those of the <hi>Polanders,</hi> and picked towards the toe, and are made of <hi>Russia</hi> Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or Goats skin brought from <hi>Persia,</hi> They have not yet the art of dressing Spanish Leather,
nor the invention of tranning Ox-hides, otherwise than the soles. The Womens shooes are half
a quarter high at the heel, set on with little nails, in so much that they can hardly go in
them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muscovian</hi> Women are habited much after the same fashion as the Men, save that their
<hi>Hongrelines,</hi> or Coats, are wider, and of the same stuff as their Wastcoats. The richer sort
have them layd over very thick with Gold, Silver, or Silk-Lace, and have buttons and loops of
the same stuff, or great buttons of Silver or Tinn; to fasten them. The sleeves are so put on, as
that they may thrust their hands into them, or let them hang down. They wear no <hi>Kaftans;</hi>
much less use those high collars, which are thought so ornamental for the Men. Their Smock
sleeves are four or five ells long, and are set in little folds upon the arm. They wear very wide
Caps or Coifs of Damask, plain or purfled Satin, embroider'd with Gold and Silver, and lined
with Castors, the hair whereof does in a manner cover all their forehead. Maids that are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riageable
wear cloath Caps, lined with Fox-skin.</p>
                     <p>It is not long since, that strangers, whether Physicians, or Merchants, as the <hi>French, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> went in <hi>Muscovian</hi> habits, to avoid the insolence of the people,
who many times took occasion to affront them, out of no other reason than the diversity of their
cloaths. But the present Patriarch, having observ'd in a <hi>Procession,</hi> that the <hi>Germans</hi> who had
thrust in among the <hi>Muscovites</hi> to see it pass by, betraid a certain irreverence at their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
especially at the Benediction he gave the people, was incens'd thereat, and said, that those
strangers, being not worthy to participate of the Benediction which was given to the faithful, it
were fit the Great Duke put out an Ordinance, obliging strangers to cloath themselves according
to the fashions of their own Countries. The contempt of any Law is severely punish'd in <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy:</hi>
but the observation of this was so much the more difficult, in that, for want of Taylors,
it was almost impossible for people to get other cloaths within the time limited by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Yet were they forc'd to obey, which occasion'd very good sport, in that those who
were servants to the Great Duke, being oblig'd to be every day at the Court, and not daring to
appear there in <hi>Muscovian</hi> habits, they were forc'd to put on what they could meet withall, and
to make use of those cloaths which their Grand-fathers, and Great-grand-fathers had worn,
when the Tyrant <hi>Iohn Basilouits</hi> forc'd them out of <hi>Livonia,</hi> to go and live at <hi>Moscou.</hi>
'Twas a strange sight to see them all in cloaths that were either too big, or too little, as having
not been made for them, besides that there was no acquaintance at all between Breeches and
Doublet, or any correspondence between the age wherein they had been made, and that they
were then worn in. Ever since that time every Nation is clad according to their own modes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muscovites</hi> never change their fashion, nor can I remember any more than one Lord,
who took a fancy to the <hi>French</hi> mode. His name is <hi>Knez Mikita Iouanouits Romanou,</hi> very
rich, and of near kin to the Great Duke, who is much taken with his humour and conversation.
This Lord hath a particular affection for Strangers, and goes in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Polish</hi> modes in
his cloaths, especially when he goes either into the Country or a-hunting. But the Patriarch,
who dislik'd that feedom in him, and was displeased also with another, which that Prince took,
to speak somewhat slightly of their Religion, enjoy'd him not to speak any further of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Nothing so wretched as the cloathing of the Country people. It is of a very coarse Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vase,
and their shooes of barks of trees, which they have the art to sow and interlace like pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers,
with a miraculous industry. There is hardly any <hi>Muscovite</hi> but is good at this Trade,
and does exercise it; so that it may be said, <hi>Muscovy</hi> hath as many Shoomakers as men, or at
least, that there is no Family, but hath its particular Shooemaker. It is upon the same accompt
said of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> that he hath a Baylywick in the Dutchy of <hi>Prussia,</hi> which is
that of <hi>Insterbourg,</hi> where there are above 15000. shooemakers, for all the Peasants of that
Baylywick make their own shooes.</p>
                     <p>If a man consider the natures and manner of life of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life.</note> he will be forc'd to
avow, there cannot any thing be more barbarous than that people. Their boast is that they are
desended from the antient <hi>Greeks,</hi> but, to do them no injustice, there is no more comparison
between the brutality of these <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and the civility of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to whom all other
parts of the VVorld are oblig'd for all their literature and civilization, than there is between
day and night. They never learn any Art or Science, nor apply themselves to any kind of Study:
on the contrary, they are so ignorant, as to think, a man cannot make an Almanack unless he
be a Sorcerer, nor foretell the Revolutions of the Moon and Eclipses, unless he have some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with Devils. Upon this accompt it was, that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> generally grumbled
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47786:47"/>
when the Great Duke would have entertain'd me into his service, in the quality of his Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and Mathematician, as we return'd from our Voyage into <hi>Persia,</hi> and rais'd a report, that
their Prince was going to bring a Magician into his Court. This aversion I discover'd in the
<hi>Muscovites,</hi> took off that little inclination I sometime had to embrace that employment,
which was offer'd me, not so much upon the accompt of my abilities in Astronomy, as, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
me to continue in the Countrey, because they knew, that I had exactly observ'd, and
drawn into a Map the whole course of the River <hi>Wolga,</hi> whereof they were unwilling that
strangers should have any knowledge. When I came to <hi>Muscovy,</hi> upon the affairs of the Duke
of <hi>Holstein</hi> my Master, in the year 1643. I shew'd them upon a Wall of an obscure Chamber,
through a little hole I had made in the shutter of the window, by the means of a piece of glass
polish'd and cut for Opticks, all was done in the street, and men walking upon their heads:
This wrought such an effect in them, that they could never after be otherwise perswaded than
that I held a correspondence with the Devil.</p>
                     <p>They esteem Physicians, and Medicine, but will not permit that people should make use of
the same means as is done elsewhere to gain the perfection of that Science. They will not suffer
the body to be opened, that so the causes of diseases may be found out, and they have a strange
aversion for <hi>Skeletons</hi> There is to this purpose a pleasant story of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Surgeon who liv'd
at <hi>Moscou</hi> some years since. His name was <hi>Quirin,</hi> one much favour'd by the Great Duke,
because of his facetious humour, and his experience in the Art he profess'd. It happen'd one
day, that this good man diverting himself in his Chamber, and playing a Lesson on the Lute,
the <hi>Strelitz,</hi> who are spying up and down every where, drew near to the place where that
Musick was: but perceiving through a chink, a <hi>Skeleton</hi> hanging behind him, which the wind
coming in at the window caused to move, they were frightned, and reported, that the strange
Surgeon had a dead Carkass that mov'd at the sound of his Musick. The Great Duke and the
Patriarch desirous to be truly inform'd of the business, sent others to make a further discovery;
and these not only confirm'd what the others had reported, but added, that they had seen the
<hi>Skeleton</hi> dance, while the Surgeon play'd. The business was thought to be of such importance,
as that it were fit to be communicated to the Councel, where, <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
That it was done by Magick. That, consequently, the Surgeon was a Magician, and
as such, ought to be burnt, together with the <hi>Skeleton.</hi> The Surgeon hearing of this sentence,
intreated a Merchant of his acquaintance, who had much credit at Court, to represent to <hi>Knez
Iuan Borissowits Cirkaski,</hi> that most Surgeons and Physicians in <hi>Germany</hi> make use of those <hi>Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letons,</hi>
to find out the composure of the body, and juncture of the bones, that so they might
the better know how to cure what may happen in those parts. Upon this Lord's representation,
the former sentence was revers'd; but <hi>Quirin</hi> was forc'd to leave the Countrey, and the <hi>Skele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
was dragg'd along the streets, and burnt on the other side of the River <hi>Moska.</hi> A <hi>German</hi>
Painter ran the same hazard about six years since. For the <hi>Strelits,</hi> who were got into his
house, with intent to pull it down, to hinder the Progress of a fire, which had already done
mischief enough, meeting with a dead man's skull, or death's head, would have cast both it
and the Master of the house into the fire, and had done it, if his friends had not deliver'd him
out of the hands of those <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and convinc'd them of the innocent use of that head, in
the art he profess'd.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, The <hi>Muscovites</hi> do not want ingenuity, but they employ their wit so ill, that
not any of their actions is directed to vertue and the glory which ever attends it.<note place="margin">They are ingenuous naturally.</note> The <hi>Danish</hi>
Gentleman, who publish'd the Embassy be was sent upon, into <hi>Muscovy,</hi> from <hi>Frederick</hi> II.
gives the <hi>Muscovites</hi> a very true Character, in two Lines, when he says, That they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
over-reaching, humourous, self-will'd, obstinate, insolent, and impudent, that they
regulate their reason according to their power, and that they have shaken hands with all vertues,
to run themselves into all manner of vice.</p>
                     <p>Their industry and subtilty is chiefly seen in their Traffick, in which there is no craft or cheat
but they make use of, rather to circumvent others, than to prevent being deceiv'd themselves.
I wonder'd to see them sell Cloath at three Crowns and a half the Ell, which they had bought
of the <hi>English</hi> at four, and yet I was told they made a good profit thereby; for buying the
Cloath at a twelve months time for payment, and selling it for ready money, though at a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
rate, they made use of the money, and employ'd it in other things, which brought in more
profit, than they would have made by selling the Cloath upon time, though they sold much
dearer than it cost them. They make a conscience to retain what is paid them more than their
due, and are so honest as to return what they have receiv'd by mistake: but they think it no
sin, in their dealings, to surprize those who Trade with them, giving this reason, that the
Merchant is to make his advantage of the Wit and industry God hath bestow'd on him, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meddle with Traffick. According to this principle, a certain <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant having noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
over-reach'd several <hi>Muscovites,</hi> these Gentlemen were so far from being troubled at
it, that they spake of him, as of an excellent ingenuous man, and desir'd they might go part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with him, out of a hope they conceiv'd, that he would discover some great secret to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:47786:47"/>
And whereas cheating cannot be exercis'd without treachery, lying, and distrust, which are
its constant attendants, they are marvellously well vers'd in these qualities, as also in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of Calumny,<note place="margin">Are lyars and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustful.</note> which they commonly make use of against those on whom they would be
revenged for theft, which among them is the most enormous of all Crimes, and the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
punish'd. To this end, they are so cunning, as to pawn at, or get secretly convey'd
into their Lodgings, whom they would accuse, those things which they would have believed
were stollen from them, or they thrust them into their Enemies Boots; for in them the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
commonly carry their money and Letters. To make some provision against these abuses,
the Great Duke made an Edict in the year 1634. enjoyning that for the future, all Promises or
Obligations, whether for borrowing of money or pawning; though it were between Father
and Son, should be set down in writing and sign'd by both parties, else the debt to be lost. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofoe,
especially in the Reign of the Tyrant <hi>Iohn Basilouits,</hi> there needed no more to procure
a man's death or banishment, than to accuse him of High-Treason, without any Process, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
or Defence allow'd, all that were charged being punish'd, without any distinction
of Sex, Age, or Quality. Calumnies, and false suggestions were so common under that
Prince, that many strangers, even publick persons, many times fell into those misfortunes,
the Tyrant never regarding their Character as Ambassadors, nor that of the Princes by whom
they were sent. He banish'd, into <hi>Siberia,</hi> the Emperours Ambassadour, and caus'd him to
be so ill-treated, that the poor man resolv'd at last to change his Religion, hoping by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
to alleviate his misery. The Great Duke <hi>Michael Federouits,</hi> shew'd no more respect
for the late King of <hi>France,</hi> when he sent the Marquesse of <hi>Exiducil</hi> into <hi>Siberia,</hi> where,
by the Artifices of his Collegue, <hi>Iames Roussel,</hi> he was a Prisoner 3 years, as we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>To this purpose,<note place="margin">A pleasant story.</note> 
                        <hi>Martin Baar,</hi> Pastor of <hi>Narva,</hi> who liv'd at <hi>Moscou</hi> under the reign of
the Great Duke <hi>Boris Gudenou,</hi> told us this story. The Great Duke being troubled with the
Gout caus'd to be proclaim'd, that whoever could give him any ease should have very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
The wife of a certain <hi>Bojare,</hi> exasperated by the ill usage she had receiv'd from her
husband, went and inform'd, that the <hi>Bojare</hi> had an excellent remedy for the Gout; but had
so little affection for his Majesty, that he would not communicate it. They sent for the man,
who was not a little astonish'd when he understood the cause of his disgrace; but what excuses
soever he made, all was attributed to his malice. He was whipp'd, even to bloud, and cast in
Prison, where he could not forbear breaking out into passion, and saying, that he saw well
enough it was his wife had put that trick upon him, and that he would be reveng'd on her. The
Great Duke imagining these menaces proceeded from the trouble it was to him that his wife had
revealed what he would have kept secret, ordered him to be whipp'd more cruelly than the time
before, and sent one to tell him, that if he did not apply his remedy, he should prepare himself
for present death. The poor fellow perceiving his destruction unavoidable, said at last, that he
knew indeed a remedy, but doubting of its certainty, he durst not try it on his Majesty; yet if
they would allow him fifteen dayes to prepare it, he would apply it. Having that time grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, he sent to <hi>Czirback,</hi> two dayes journey from <hi>Moscou,</hi> upon the River <hi>Occa,</hi> whence
he had brought him a Wagon full of all sorts of Herbs, good and bad, and therewith prepar'd a
Bath for the Great Duke, who thereupon grew somewhat better. For whether it were that the
Disease was declining, or that among so many Herbs of all sorts, there were some good for his
Disease, he had some ease. Then were they confirm'd in the opinion they had before, that the
<hi>Bojares</hi> denyal to apply his remedy proceeded from his malice, whereupon he had a more cruel
whipping than the two former times, and there was given him a present of four hundred
Crowns, together with eighteen Peasants to be his slaves; with a strict charge, not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any animosity against his wife, who made this advantage thereby, that, ever after, they
liv'd very lovingly together.</p>
                     <p>But now they proceed with more caution, and no man is condemn'd without an exact infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Crime laid to his charge. And for the utter taking away of all calumny, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser
must be content to endure the Torture first; and if, while he is in the Torment, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in his accusation, the accused person is also put to it, nay, many times he is condemn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
so much as being heard. We saw an example of this in the wife of one of the Great Duke's
Farriers, who desirous to be rid of her husband, charg'd him that he would have poyson'd the
Horses, and had he the opportunity, even the Great Duke himself. She endur'd the Torture
without varying in her accusation, and her husband was sent to Prison into <hi>Siberia.</hi> We were
shew'd the woman, who was still paid the one half of her husband's Pension. From this kind of
demeanour among the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> and their infidelity one to another, it may be judg'd, what
strangers are to expect from them, and how far they are to be trusted. They never proffer their
friendship, nor contract any with others, but for their own interest and advantage. The ill
education they have when young, never learning any thing beyond reading and writing, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
vulgar prayers, makes them blindly follow that which in Beasts is called <hi>Instinct;</hi> so that
Nature being in them depraved and corrupted, their whole life must needs be a constant course
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47786:48"/>
of viciousness. Thence it comes, they are bruitish, doing all things according to their unbridled
passions and appetites.</p>
                     <p>The fierceness of all other Nations, some <hi>Islanders</hi> excepted, argues something of Spirit and
Generosity; but the opinion the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have of themselves and their abilities, is sottish,
gross, and impertinent; and the pride and vain glory of those who are ever so little advanc'd in
Honours or Estates, is insupportable. They dissemble it not, but all their behaviour, words,
and actions, discover what they really are. Upon this principle they ground the fond conceit
they have of the greatness, power, and wealth of their Prince, whom they preferr before all the
other Monarchs of <hi>Europe.</hi> Thence it is also, that they would not have other Princes assume those
qualities which may denote their competition with him. They sottishly and insolently command
Ambassadors to be uncover'd first, and by force take all advantage over them, imagining it
were a great injury to themselves and their Prince, to treat Strangers with any civility. Private
persons write and speak in unhandsome terms, but such as give the less offence, in that they bear
with the same treatment from others. 'Tis true, they began to learn a little civility, since they
became sensible of the advantages arising to them from the Commerce they have with Strangers,
and there are some use them with discretion: but of these there are very few, and, excepting
<hi>Nikita,</hi> whom we have spoken of, and two or three more, it would be hard to find as many
others that deserve this commendation.</p>
                     <p>Nor have they any more complyance one for another,<note place="margin">Have no civility.</note> than they have difference for strangers;
for instead of being civil one to another, they take place, and all other advantages, one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
When we were at <hi>Nisenovogorod,</hi> the Chancellor's Steward coming to see us, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
invited him to Dinner; but when they were to sit down, the <hi>Pristaf</hi> would take place
of him, which begat a contestation concerning their quality. One, as he was a <hi>Sinbojar,</hi> or
Gentleman, pretended to precedence before the <hi>Pristaf,</hi> who was not a person eminent by birth;
the later, being there upon the accompt of his Prince, would not have the other to make any
comparison with him. Whore's son and dog were the mildest of their term; for half an hour
and better, and that without any respect for the Ambassadors, who were at last forc'd to tell
them, that they had invited them to be merry, and not to be troubled with their contests, and
entreated them, at that time, to eat and drink, and to take some other, to decide their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
They took their advice, and grew such good friends, as if the entertainment had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for their reconciliation, which seem'd to be very sincere in their Wine, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their custome made them kindly drunk.</p>
                     <p>They are all much given to quarrelling,<note place="margin">Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</note> in so much that in the streets they will rail at, and
abuse one another like Fish-Wives, and that with such animosity, that those who are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with their humour think they will not part without fighting; but they seldome come
to those extremities, or if they fight, it is with their fists, or switches, and the height of their
rage is kicking, as much as they can, in the belly and about the sides. 'Twas never yet known
that any <hi>Muscovite</hi> fought with Sword or Pistol, or that they are sensible of that gallantry
wherein many would unjustly place true courage. The great Lords, <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojares,</hi> fight on
horse-back, but the weapon is a good Whip, and so they soon decide what differences happen
between them.</p>
                     <p>When they quarrel,<note place="margin">Insolent in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</note> they forbear cursing, swearing and blaspheming, but rail at one another
in such bitter and horrid expressions, as no Country being able to parallel them, 'tis but discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to forbear defiling this relation therewith. The language of Fathers and Mothers to their
Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the Children to them again, is such as cannot be express'd without horrour,
much beyond what the most debauch'd persons elsewhere are guilty of. Some years since the
Great Duke prohibited these insolences upon pain of whipping, and the Magistrate was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to send <hi>Strelits</hi> and Serjeants among the people to surprise Offenders, and to see them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
punish'd. But it was sound by experience, that the remedy came too late, and that the
mischief was so deeply rooted, and so generally spread, that it was, not only hard, but abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
impossible to put those prohibitions in execution. So that, for the vindication of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of quality an order was made, that he who affronts any such, or any of the Great Duke's
Officers, either by word or deed, should be fined, which fine they call <hi>Biscestia,</hi> and sometimes
amounts to 2000. Crowns, according to the quality of the Person injur'd. If an Officer of the
Great Duke's makes his complaint of injury done him, his reparation will be according to his
relation to the Court. To a Lady, 'tis doubled, to a Son, 'tis augmented by a third part; to a
Daughter, there is an abatement of a third part: and the penalty is paid as many times as there
are persons injured, though they were dead many years before. If the Offender hath not to pay,
he is put into his Adversaries hands, who disposes of him so as to make him his Slave, or cause
him to be whipt by the common Executioner. One <hi>Iohn Barnley,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Merchant, of
whom we shall speak elsewhere, was sentenc'd to pay the <hi>Biscestia</hi> to another <hi>English</hi> man, Dr.
<hi>Day,</hi> Physician to the Great Duke; and Capt. <hi>de la Coste,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman found means to
make an exchange of the penalty laid upon him at the sute of a <hi>German</hi> Colonel, for that
which the same Colonel was to pay another <hi>French</hi> man, named <hi>Anthony le Groin,</hi> who was
pleas'd thereby to oblige his friend, <hi>la Coste.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:47786:48"/>
There is nothing polite in their conversation; on the contrary, they are not asham'd to yawn,
belch, and stretch themselves, where ever they are, their belching being the more offensive,
by reason of the abundance of Onions and Garlick they use in all theit meat, which make their
breaths strong enough, without those exaltations. This they are so accustom'd to, that they
stick not to do it in any company, the Great Duke's presence only excepted.</p>
                     <p>They do not apply themselves to the study of any Art or Science,<note place="margin">Not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to any study.</note> nor inquire into the affairs
of other Countries, and consequently never discourse of any such thing: but it were well on the
other side, if they could forbear talking of their uncleannesses and brutalities, which they
make their divertisement in their debauches. I speak not of the Entertainments of Great Lords,
but of the ordinary company keeping of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> where all their discourse is of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations
which they themselves have done, or seen committed by others, making ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the crimes which here would be expiated by fire, and the memory thereof buried in their
ashes. But as they are wholly given up to all licentionsness, even to sins against Nature, not
only with Men, but also with Beasts, he who can tell most stories of that kind, and set them
out in most gestures, is accompted the bravest Man. Their Fidlers put them into Songs, and
their Mountebanks make publick representations of them, and stick not to shew their Breeches,
and sometimes all they have to their Spectators. Those who lead Bears about, Juglers; and
Puppet-players, who erect a Stage in a moment, by the means of a coverlet, which, being
ty'd about their wast, is brought over their heads, and within it show their Puppets, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
their brutalities, and sodomies, make sport to the Children, who are thereby induc'd
to quit all sentiments of shame and honesty.</p>
                     <p>Nay these are quite discarded by the <hi>Muscovites.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Shameless</note> The postures of their dancing, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence
of their Women, are infallible marks of their bad inclinations. We have seen at <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou</hi>
both Men and Women come out of the publick Brothell-houses stark naked, and incite some
young people of our retinue to naughtiness by filthy and lascivious expressions. Idleness, which
is the Mother of all Vices, and seems to have been bestow'd on these barbarous people as their
portion, is that which makes them run into these excesses, whereto their drunkenness does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
contribute; in as much as being naturally inclin'd to luxury, when they are once got into
their Wine they mind nothing else. <hi>I</hi> have to this purpose a story, which the Great Duke's
Interpreter told me when we were at <hi>Novogorod:</hi> how that in the said City, there is an anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
devotion, to which come abundance of Pilgrims. He who is allow'd to keep a tipling-house,
gets a permission from the Metropolitan, to pitch several Tents, for the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Pilgrims of both Sexes, who are sure to be there betimes in the morning before ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and to take off some Cups of strong-water. Nay some of them instead of minding their
devotions spend the day in drinking, whence arise such strange disorders, that he told me, he
saw a Woman got so drunk there, that coming out of the Tent she fell down; and fell asleep,
naked as she was, in the street, in the day time. Which gave occasion to a <hi>Muscovite,</hi> who
was also drunk, to lye down by her, and, having made use of her, to fall also asleep in sight
of many people, who having made a ring about them, only laught at the posture they were in,
till at last an old man, conceiving a horrour at the spectacle, cover'd them with his own gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>There's no place in the World where drunkenness is more common than in <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards.</note> All, of
all conditions, Ecclesiasticks and Laicks, Men and Women, Old and Young, will drink
strong-water at any time, before, at, and after their meals. They call it <hi>Tzarkowino,</hi> and
fail not to offer of it to those who visit them. The lowest sort of people, Peasants and Slaves,
refuse not the Cups which are given them by some person of Quality, but will drink of it till
they lye down, and many times dye in the place. Nay their Great ones are not free from this
vice, as for example, the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Ambassador, sent to <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> in the
year 1608. who, forgetting his quality and the affairs his Master had entrusted him with, took
so much strong-water the night before he was to have audience, that the next day being found
dead in his bed, they were forc'd to carry him to his Grave, instead of conducting him to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                     <p>The meaner sort of people think it not enough to stay in the Tipling-house till they have not a
<hi>Copec</hi> left in their purses, but many times pawn their cloaths there even to their shirts, which is
no more than what is seen dayly during our aboad at <hi>Moscou.</hi> Being lodg'd at <hi>Lubeck</hi>-house,
as I went to <hi>Novogorod,</hi> in my Voyage to <hi>Muscovy</hi> in 1643. I saw coming out of an Ale-house
not far thence, several of those Drunkards, some without Caps, others without Shoes or Stockins,
some without Wastcoats, and only their Shirts. One I took notice of above the rest, who came
our first without his <hi>Kaftan,</hi> and in his Shirt, but meeting a friend by the way going to the
Tipling-house, he went back with him, and came not out again till he had left his shirt behind
him. I call'd to him, and ask'd him what he had done with his shirt, and whether he had been
robb'd? He answer'd with the ordinary civility of the <hi>Muscovites, Iabut fui matir, Mind
thy own business; Good Wine hath put me into this posture: but since the shirt hath stayd behind,
the Drawers shall go and keep them company,</hi> which he had no sooner said, but he returns to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47786:49"/>
house, whence I saw him come presently afterward naked as an <hi>Adamite,</hi> covering his privy
parts with a handful of flowers, which he had taken up at the door, and so went very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>cundly
to his own house.</p>
                     <p>Being in the same City of <hi>Novogorod</hi> at the time of our second Embassy, I saw a Priest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the Tipling-house, who coming by our Lodging would needs give the benediction to
the <hi>Strclits,</hi> who stood Sentinel at the door, but as he lifted up his hands, going to make the
inclination used in that Ceremony, the head, fraught with the vapours of the Wine, was so
heavy, that weighing down the whole body, the Pope fell down in the dirt. Our <hi>Strclits</hi> took
him up with much respect, and receiv'd his daggled benediction; it being, it seems, a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ordinary among them.</p>
                     <p>The Great Duke <hi>Michael Federouits,</hi> who was a sober person, and hated drunkenness, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
with himself that it was impossible absolutely to prevent those excesses, made in his
time several orders for the moderating of them, causing the Tipling-houses to be shut up, and
prohibiting the selling of strong-water or Hydromel without his permission, and that those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where they were sold, should sell only by the Quart and Pint, and not by Cups. This had
some effect, in that there was no more <hi>Adamites</hi> seen in the streets, but hindred not their being
strew'd with Drunkards, the Neighbours and such of their friends, as had a design to be merry,
sending to the Tavern for several Pottles of Strong-water, which they would be sure to turn off
ere they parted.</p>
                     <p>The women are no less given to drink than the men.<note place="margin">Women gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to drink.</note> I saw a pleasant example of it at <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
in the house where I lodg'd, whither many <hi>Muscovian</hi> women came one day to their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
sate down with them, and took off their Cups as smartly as they did. The men being
got drunk, would have gone home, but the women thought it not yet time to draw off, though
invited thereto by a good number of boxes o'th'ear, and got their husbands to sit down again,
and to drink roundly as before, till such time as that the men being fall'n down asleep upon the
ground, the women sate upon them, as upon benches, and drunk on till they also were forc'd to
lye down by them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iames de Cologne,</hi> at whose house I lodg'd at <hi>Narva,</hi> told me he had seen such another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
at his Wedding; at which, the <hi>Muscovites</hi> having given their Wives good banging, sate
down and drunk with them, till that being lay'd on the ground, the Women sate upon them,
and grew so drunk, till at last they lay down among them.</p>
                     <p>Tobacco was heretofore so common there,<note place="margin">Tobacco forbidden among them.</note> that it was generally taken, both in smoak and
powder. To prevent the mischiefs occasion'd by the use of it, which were not only, that the
poorer sort of people ruin'd themselves thereby, in as much as if they had but a penny, they
would rather bestow it in Tobacco than bread, but also because many times it set houses on fire
and those that took it presented themselves with their stinking and infectious breaths before their
Images, the Great Duke and the Patriarch thought fit in the year 1634. absolutely to forbid the
sale and use of it. Those who are convicted of having either taken or sold any, are very rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
punish'd. They have their Nostrils slit or are whipp'd, as we have often seen done; of
the manner of which punishment we shall speak when we come to treat of the administration of
Justice in that Countrey.</p>
                     <p>The perverse disposition of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">They are born to slavery.</note> the baseness of their education, and the slavery
they seem born to, cause them to be treated like beasts, rather than people endued with reason.
They are naturally so much inclin'd to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>leness, that it were impossible to bring them to take
any pains, but by the Whip and the Cudgel, which yet they are not much troubled at, as
being hardened to blows, by the custom which the younger sort have to meet on Holy-dayes,
and to divert themselves by cuffing or fighting with staves, never being angry at what happens.
Those who are free-born, but poor, do so little value that advantage, that they sell themselves
with their family for a small matter; nay, they are so mindless of their liberty, that they will
sell themselves a second time, after they had recovered it, by the death of their Master, or some
other occasion.</p>
                     <p>Their submissions to their Superiours discover the lowness of their spirits, and their slavery.
They never come before persons of quality, but they bow down to the ground, which they
touch and smite with their forehead, nay, there are some will cast themselves at their Lords
feet, to give them thanks after they had been sufficiently beaten by them. No <hi>Muscovite,</hi> what
quality soever he be of, but makes it his brag, to be the Great Duke's <hi>Golop,</hi> or Slave: and to
express their humility or adjection, even in the least things, they put their names into diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and neither speak nor write to him, but instead of <hi>Iwan,</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> they say <hi>Iwantske,</hi> that
is the diminutive; and sign thus, <hi>Petrusketwoy Golop, Petrillo your slave.</hi> The Great Duke
speaking to them uses the same expression, treating them in all things like slaves, as far as Whips
and Cudgels can do it, which is but consonant to their own acknowledgement, That their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and estates are God's and the Great Duke's.</p>
                     <p>Those strangers who settle in <hi>Muscovy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Strangers are in no better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition there</note> or are entertain'd into the <hi>Czaar's</hi> service, must
resolve to do the same submissions, and be content with the same treatment. For what kindness
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47786:49"/>
soever he may have for them, it requires so small a matter to deserve the Whip, that there is
hardly any can brag he hath not had it. Heretofore there were none more subject to the Lash,
than the Physicians, it being the perswasion of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> that that art was infallible, and
that the success of it depended on their wills, who profess'd the curing of diseases. Hence was it,
that in the year 160<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> brother to <hi>Christian</hi> the fourth King of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
who had married the Great Duke <hi>Boris Gudenous</hi> daughter, falling sick, the <hi>Czaar</hi> sent word
to the Physicians, that if they recovered him not, their lives should answer for the Prince's: so
that they seeing the remedies apply'd were fruitless, and that it was impossible to save the
Prince, kept out of the way, and durst not come into the Great Duke's presence, till he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was troubled with the Gowt, and sent for them. Among the rest, there was one a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
who having practised Physick some time in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> had some thoughts of returning
into <hi>Germany</hi> to take the degree of Doctor. But the Great Duke desirous to know the occasion
upon which he desir'd leave to go, understanding that he went thither to be examin'd, and so
take his Degree, which the Faculty gives and confirms by its Letters Patents, he told him, that
having been often eas'd of his pain by his remedies, he was satisfy'd of his sufficiency; and,
as to Letters, if there were any need of them, he would give him such as should be as authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
as any he could get from the Universities of <hi>Germany,</hi> and so he needed not put himself to
the trouble and expence of that journey.</p>
                     <p>This Physician was one of those who kept out of the way upon the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi>'s death,
and imagining the Great Duke would send for him in order to his execution, he put on a tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
Garment, and having his hair negligently hanging down over his eyes and face, he came
in that posture to the Great Duke's Chamber-door, into which he went, creeping on all four,
and coming to his bed-side, told him, that he was not worthy to live, much less be admitted
into his Majesties presence, since he was so unfortunate as to be out of his favour. Upon which
one of the <hi>Knez,</hi> who were about the Duke, thinking to make his Prince some sport, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him as a <hi>Sabak,</hi> or Dog, kick'd him in the head, and drew blood of him. The Physician,
perceiving the great Duke look'd favourably on him, thought fit to make his advantage of it,
and with a certain confidence said to him, <hi>Great Prince, I know I am your Slave, but be pleas'd
to give me leave to tell you, that I am only yours. I know I have deserv'd death, and should think
my self happy to receive it from your hands; but it troubles me to be affronted by this</hi> Knez, <hi>who is
but your Slave as well as my self; and I think it is not your desire, that any other should have power
over me.</hi> These words, and the need the Great Duke stood in of this Physician, procur'd him
a present of a thousand Crowns; his Fellow-Physicians were pardoned, and the <hi>Bojar</hi> had a
good cudgelling.</p>
                     <p>As for slaves,<note place="margin">They keep many Slaves.</note> their number is not regulated, some Lords have above a hundred of them in
their Country-houses and Farms, Those they entertain for their service in the City; do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
in their houses, but have board-wages, their allowance so small, that it is as much as they
can do to live upon it. And this is one of the chiefest causes of the many disorders and mischiefs
done at <hi>Moscou,</hi> there passing hardly a night but violences and murthers are committed. Great
Lords and rich Merchants have a Guard in their Courts, who watch all night, and are oblig'd
to express their vigilance, by the noise they make upon boards with a stick, much after the
manner of playing upon the Timbrels, which done, they give as many knocks as the Clock hath
struck hours. But these Guards watching many times more for the advantage of house-breakers,
than that of their Masters, there is none used now, and no servant is taken into a house, but
upon good City-security for his truth.</p>
                     <p>This great number of slaves makes it unsafe to walk the streets of <hi>Moscou,</hi> in the night time
un-arm'd and without Company. We had the experience of it in some of our servants, upon
several occasions. Our Master-Cook, who had been employ'd at a person's of quality, where
the Ambassadors had Dined, was kill'd as he came home in the night; which misfortune hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
also to the Steward belonging to the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassador, <hi>Spiring.</hi> The Lieutenant, who
had commanded our <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Musketiers, in our Voyage into <hi>Persia,</hi> was in like
manner kill'd in the night, having been with some others at the Wedding of a <hi>German</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
daughter. And as there passed no night almost without murther, so these disorders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
towards great Festivals, especially on flesh days, which they call <hi>Maslouitzo.</hi> On St.
<hi>Mastin's</hi> Eve, we counted fifteen dead bodies in the Court of <hi>Semskoy,</hi> a place where they are
expos'd, that their kinred and friends may know them, and take order for their burial. If no
body owns them, they are dragg'd thence like Carrion, and thrown into a Ditch without any
Ceremony.</p>
                     <p>The insolence of these Villains is so great, that they stuck not to set upon the Great Duke's
principal Physician in the day time. They stopp'd him in the street as he was going home, struck
him off his horse, and would have cut off his finger, on which he had a Gold Seal-ring, had
he not been reliev'd by some sent to his rescue, by a <hi>Knez</hi> of his acquaintance, who living near
thereabouts had seen him set upon. The misery is, that no Citizen will so much as look out at
his window, much less come out of his house, to relieve those that are affronted, so much are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47786:50"/>
they afraid to come into the same misfortue they see others engag'd in. Since our being there,
some course hath been taken herein, Watches being set, who stop those who go in the night
without Torch or Lanthorn, and carry them to the <hi>Strelitse priscas,</hi> where they are punish'd
the next day.</p>
                     <p>At Hay-making time, the road between <hi>Moscou</hi> and <hi>Tuere</hi> is very dangerous to travel, by
reason of the great number of slaves employ'd in that work, making their advantage of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
whence they discover those that pass, whom they rob and kill, without any reparation to
be expected from their Masters, who, not allowing their slaves what to subsist upon, are forc'd
to connive at their Crimes.</p>
                     <p>Masters dispose of their slaves, as they do of any other moveable; nay, a father may sell his
son, and alienate him, for his own advantage. But the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have this piece of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
that not only they seldom come to those extremities, but also had rather see their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
starve at home, than suffer them to go out any where to service. 'Tis only debt that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
engages them to make over their Children to their Creditors, the Boyes at ten, the Girls,
at eight Crowns, a year, the Children being no less oblig'd to satisfie the debt, than their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as also to endure that cruel treatment, which desperate debtors are to expect, or to sell
themselves to their Creditors.</p>
                     <p>The subjection in which they are born,<note place="margin">They are good Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> and the gross feeding they have even from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
at which time they are taught to be content with any thing, makes them very good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and such as would do very great services under strang Commanders. For though the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Discipline of the <hi>Romans</hi> allow'd not the listing of slaves in their Legions, yet does it not
follow, but that the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who are all such, may be advantageously employ'd in War,
this being certain of them, that they are excellent good in a besieg'd place, and will maintain it
to the utmost extremity. Of this we have an example at <hi>Notebourg,</hi> where two men made
their capitulation in the year 1579. The <hi>Poles,</hi> who had besieg'd the Castle of <hi>Suikols,</hi> set it a
fire as they were giving the assault; yet the <hi>Muscovites</hi> made good the breach and maintain'd
it, even when the fire reach'd their Cloaths. At the siege of the Abbey of <hi>Padis,</hi> in <hi>Livonia,</hi>
they held out till they became so weakned for want of Provisions, that they were not able to
keep Guard, nor to meet the <hi>Suedes</hi> at the Gate.</p>
                     <p>They are not indeed so fortunate in the field, and very seldom gain'd any battel against the
<hi>Poles</hi> or <hi>Suedes,</hi> their Neighbours, who have alwayes almost had the better of them, so that it
prov'd a harder matter to pursue them, than to avoid their blows. But certain it is withall, that
these misfortunes happen to them through the want of experience and conduct in their Generals,
rather than of courage in their Soldiers.</p>
                     <p>For as to the disgrace the <hi>Muscovites</hi> receiv'd at the Siege of <hi>Smolensko,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko.</hi>
                        </note> in the year 1633.
it is to be ascribed to the Generals perfidiousness, who paid his Master for his imprudence in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the command of his Army into the hands of a Stranger. He was a <hi>Polander,</hi> named <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Schein,</hi> who to curry favour with the Duke, had been so low-spirited as to receive re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization.
The Army he commanded, consisted of above a hundred thousand men, among whom
were above 6000. <hi>Germans,</hi> and several <hi>Muscovian</hi> Regiments exercised according to the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
discipline, and commanded by strange Officers, <hi>French, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pieces of Cannon, and all other things requisite to carry on the Siege against that place,
which the <hi>Poles</hi> had taken some time before from the <hi>Muscovites.</hi> The reduction of it had been so
much the easier, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n that the City is compass'd but with one simple wall, without ditch, or any
kind of fortification. Whence it came, that the <hi>Germans,</hi> who had made a reasonable breach
in it, propos'd to have it carried at the first assault. But the General oppos'd it, saying, That
he would never suffer, it should be reproach'd to the Prince his Master, that he had rais'd so
vast an Army to besiege a place, which a handful of <hi>Germans</hi> would have taken in so few dayes,
and then presently to disband it. The Colonels that were Strangers, on the other side, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the Great Duke's reputation would suffer by that Siege, and the Army it self be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
if it were not employ'd, resolv'd to give the assault, and were in a manner Masters of the
breach, when the General commanding the great Guns to be discharg'd at them, they were
forc'd to retreat. They complain'd of that procedure, so far as to make some discoveries of
their distrust of his fidelity; but he sent them word, that if they kept not within the respect due
to their General, he should find a way to chastise them, and that he would treat them as <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi>
So that not daring to make any further attempt, the Army continu'd there some time
without doing any thing, and gave the King of <hi>Poland</hi> time enough to get together a small body
of 5000. men, who possess'd themselves of all the avenues, by which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> receiv'd
their provisions, so as that within a few dayes their Army was more straightly besieg'd than the
City it self. It had been easy for the <hi>Muscovian</hi> General to prevent the <hi>Poles</hi> from taking up
those posts, but he gave them the leasure so to fortify themselves in them, that it had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for him to force them in their quarters, even if he had attempted it. The <hi>Muscovian</hi>
Army being reduc'd to this extremity, the General, to hinder it from starving, was forc'd to
capitulate with the <hi>Poles;</hi> to come in with the whole Army at mercy, and, with all that Noble
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47786:50"/>
Artillery, to leave hostages for the ransome of all the Officers and Soldiers, which the Great
Duke was oblig'd to pay. The General was so impudent as to return to <hi>Moscou,</hi> and shew
himself at Court, where he had friends enough to protect him, notwithstanding the charges put
in against him by the Officers and Soldiers: but the people express'd themselves so mov'd at his
treachery, that to prevent an insurrection, which threatned both City and State, they were
forc'd to execute him publickly in the market-place.</p>
                     <p>Most of the great Ones had a finger in his Treason, but lest he might accuse any, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him that he should not be startled at those proceedings, that it was only by way of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant,
to give the people some satisfaction, and that, before execution, his pardon would be
brought him. Which he the more easily credited, for that his changing Religion had gain'd
him the affection and favour of the Patriarch. But he had no sooner layd his head upon the
block, ere a sign was made to the Executioner to strike it off. The same day was executed also
his Son, who had some command under his Father at the Siege of <hi>Smolensko.</hi> He was brought
into the open place before the Castle, where he was stripp'd stark naked, and whipp'd to
death. All the rest of his kindred were banish'd into <hi>Siberia.</hi> This execution happened in <hi>Iune,
1634.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muscovites</hi> spend not much in house-keeping,<note place="margin">Their hous-keeping.</note> nor the <hi>Bojares,</hi> as well as those of a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
condition. It is not above thirty years, that their Lords and chiefest Merchants have built
their houses of stone: for before they were no better lodg'd than the meaner sort, in very poor
wooden buildings. Their houshold-stuff are suitable to their Lodgings, and commonly consist
only in three or four pots, and as many wooden or earthen dishes. Some have pewter, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few, and unless it be some few drinking cups, and gobelets, there is not any of silver. They
know not what scowring means, in so much that the Great Duke's plate looks little better than
the Tavern-pots, which are made clean but once a year. The better sort hang their rooms
but with mat; and to set them out yet a little better, they have only two or three Images
wretchedly painted. They have few feather-beds, but are content with mattresses, nay with
chaff or straw, and if not that to be had, they lye upon their cloaths, which in Summer they
lay upon a bench, or table; in the Winter, upon their stoves, which are flat, as in <hi>Livonia.</hi>
In this Country it is that Master and Mistress, Men and Maids, are shuffled all together into the
same room; nay in some places in the Country, I have seen the Poultry, and the Pigs, had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
the same Lodging with the Masters of the house.</p>
                     <p>They are not acquainted with our delicate meats and sawces.<note place="margin">Their feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Their ordinary food is coarse
Meal, Turneps, Coleworth, and Cowcumbers, both fresh and pickled. Their great delicacy
is Salt-fish, which being not well salted, infects the places near it, so that you may smell their
Fish-market at a great distance. They cannot want Beef and Mutton, there being good pastures
all over <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and the Forests breed such abundance of Swine, that they must needs be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cheap: but to avoid expence, as also for that their year hath more fasting dayes than flesh
dayes, they are so accustom'd to Fish and Pulse, that they care not for flesh. Add to this, that
their continual fasts have taught them so many wayes to dress their Fish, Herbs, and Pulse,
that a man may well forbear those dishes of meat which are much esteemed elsewhere. We said,
how that the Great Duke willing to entertain us from his own Table, sent us above forty dishes,
most of Pulse and Herbs. Among other things they make a sort of Pies, which they call <hi>Piro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
about the bigness and fashion of a twopenny Loaf. They fill the crust with Fish or minc'd
meat, with Chibols and a little Pepper, and fry them in a Pan with Butter, and in Lent with
Oil. 'Tis no ill dish, and may be called the <hi>Bisque</hi> of those parts.</p>
                     <p>The spawn of Fish, especially that of <hi>Sturgeon,</hi> they order thus. They take off the skin, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
neatly, and then salt them. Having been in salt some eight or ten dayes, and by that means
reduc'd as it were to a paste, they cut it into small slices, putting Onions and Pepper to them,
and they are eaten with Oil and Vinegar like a Salad. It eats much better, if, instead of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
you put the juice of Citron. Yet to love this kind of Sallade, a man must be accustomed
to it, though they think it excites appetite and fortifies Nature. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> call it <hi>Ika<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and the <hi>Italians Cavaiar.</hi> There is much of it eaten in <hi>Italy</hi> in the Lent time, instead of
Butter. The best is made upon the <hi>Wolgda,</hi> and near <hi>Astrachan,</hi> whence it is transported in
Tunns of 7. or 800. weight, by the way of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi> The Great Duke
reserves the Trade of this Commodity to himself, farms it out, and makes a very great yearly
advantage of it. To dispel the vapours rising up to the head, after excessive drinking, they take
cold roasted Veal, mince it, not too small, with some pickled Cowcumbers, adding thereto a
sawce of Pepper, Vinegar, and the juice of pickled Cowcumbers, and eat it with spoons. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
appetite, and tasts well enough.</p>
                     <p>Their ordinary drink is a sort of small Beer which they call <hi>Quas,</hi> or Hydromel; but they
never eat, without a dram of the Strong-water botle before and after their meal. Persons of
quality are furnish'd with strong Beer, Sack, and all other sorts of Wine. Their strong Beer is
brew'd in <hi>March,</hi> and kept all Summer in their Snow-houses, where they make a bed of
Ice and Snow mixt together, and then a layer of Barrels: upon them again a bed of Ice, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47786:51"/>
then another row of Barrels, covering them with straw and planks, which are instead of a vault
to them; for their Cellars are not covered.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muscovites</hi> care not much for <hi>Rhenish</hi> nor <hi>French</hi> Wines,<note place="margin">Hydromel how made.</note> thinking them not strong
enough; but they love Hydromel, which they order with Cherries, Straw-berries, Mulberries,
or Rasp-berries. That they make with Rasp-berries is the most pleasant of any. To make it
well, they put the Rasp-berries a-soaking in fair water for two or three nights, till the water
hath got their taste and colour. Into this water they put some of the purest Honey, allowing
to every pound of Hony three or four of water, as they would have the Hydromel strong or
small. They put into it a Toast dipp'd in the dreggs of Beer, which is taken out as soon as the
Hydromel begins to work, lest, continu'd longer, it should give it an ill taste. If they desire it
should be long a-working, they put it into some warm place; but if it be for present drinking,
they put it in a cool place, where it soon gives over working, and then is taken off the Lees to
be spent. To better the taste of it, they put in a little bag of Cinnamon, and grains of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
with some few Cloves. Some instead of fair water, steep the Rasp-berries 24 hours in
common Aquavitae, which gives the Hydromel an excellent tast.</p>
                     <p>Common Hydromel is made of the Honey-combs, which they beat in warm-water, stirring
it much, and after it hath rested seven or eight hours, they cleanse it through a Sieve, boyl it,
scum it, and without any more ado expose it to sale.</p>
                     <p>Persons of Quality discover themselves by their retinue and expence,<note place="margin">The expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of quality.</note> which yet is not so great
as might be imagin'd. For though they have sometimes 50. 60. or more Slaves about them,
their stables well furnish'd, and make great feasts well supply'd with Meat, and all sorts of Beer,
Wine, Hydromel, and Strong-water, yet all comes from their Country-houses and Dairies,
so as that they buy but very little. Their entertainments are so many baits to draw in Presents,
which they expect of those that are not of their own quality, in so much that they deerly buy
the honour which the <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojares</hi> do them upon such occasions. Strange Merchants know
well enough what that honour is to cost them, and desire it not, but to gain the favour of the
Great ones, whose countenance they stand in need of. The <hi>Weywodes</hi> are sure to make two or
three of these entertainments yearly in their Governments.</p>
                     <p>The greatest honour a <hi>Muscovite</hi> thinks he can do his friend, is to let him see his Wife,<note place="margin">The highest act of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility.</note> to
be presented with a Cup of Strong-water by her, and to permit he should kiss her. Count <hi>Leo
Alexander de Slakou</hi> gave me to understand so much at my being in <hi>Muscovy</hi> in the year 1643.
Having dined with him, he made me withdraw into another Chamber, where he told me, that
he could not make a greater expression of the respects he had for me, nor a greater acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the obligation he had to his Highness, than to shew me his Wife. She presently
came in, very richly clad in her wedding-cloaths, and follow'd by a Gentlewoman with a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Strong water and a Silver Cup. The Lady bid her fill out, and having put it to her
mouth, presented it to me, and oblig'd me to drink it off; which I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d thrice together. That
done, the Count would have me kiss her, which I the more wondred at, in regard that kind
of civility is not yet known in <hi>Holstein.</hi> Wherefore I would have contented my self to have
kiss'd only her hand; but he so kindly engag'd me to kiss her lips, that there was no avoiding
of it. She presented me a Handkercher, embroider'd at the extremities with Gold, Silver and
Silk, with a deep fringe, such as are presented to the Bride on her Wedding day. Afterwards
I found a note fasten'd to it, wherein was the name of <hi>Stresnof,</hi> Uncle by the Fathers side to
the Great Dutchess.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojares</hi> have not only pensions and considerable allowances, but also great
real estates. Merchants and Tradesmen live by Commerce and their Trades. Those who may
go out of the Country, and are permitted to Traffick into <hi>Persia, Poland, Sueden,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi>
carry thither <hi>Sables;</hi> and other furs, flax, hemp, and <hi>Russia</hi>-leather.</p>
                     <p>Tradesmen find it not hard to gain a subsistence for their families, by reason of the plenty of
all manner of Provisions. They are very handy, and easily imitate any thing they see done,
though they are not so rich in inventions as the <hi>Germans</hi> and other <hi>Europaeans;</hi> for I have seen
some of their carv'd works as well done as the best in <hi>Germany;</hi> so that strangers who are not
willing to have the secret of their professions discovered, must take heed of <hi>Muscovites, Iohn
Valk,</hi> whom we mention'd before, would never cast any thing in their presence. Now they
cast pieces of Artillery themselves, and <hi>Valk</hi>'s Disciple made a Bell, while we were there, which
weigh'd 7700 <hi>poudes,</hi> which amount to 3080 hundred weight. But it had not been long us'd
ere it crack'd, and now 'tis broken to pieces, and another to be made of a far greater weight
than the former.</p>

it is that about noon most shops are shut up, and the Merchants or their Apprentices sleeping at

than there is at midnight.</p>
                     <p>This was one sign whereby they discovered the imposture of the counterfeit <hi>Demetrius.</hi> We
shall find in the ensuing story of him, that the Impostor slept not after Dinner, and that the

                        <hi>Muscovites</hi> inferr'd thence that he was a stranger; as also by his aversion to Baths, which are
so common in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> that there is neither Town nor Village, but hath very many of them,
both publick and private. This is all they have gentile among them, as a thing they conceive
necessary upon several occasions, especially at <hi>Marriages.</hi> after the first Coition.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Astrachan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their stoves and bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places.</note> I had the curiosity to go unknown into one of them, which by a division of
boards was contriv'd into two rooms. But, besides that it was easie to look out of one into the
other, by reason of the distance there was between the boards, both men and women went in
and out at the same door, those of either Sex who would express a greater modesty hiding
what they would not have seen with a handful of leaves, which being dry'd in Summer, they,
for this purpose put a-soking into warm water: but some were stark naked, and the women
were not shy to come in that posture and speak with their husbands, even while other men
stood by.</p>
                     <p>'Tis almost a Miracle to see how their bodies, accustomed to, and hardned by cold, can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
so intense a heat, and how that, when they are not able to endure it any longer, they
come out of the stoves, naked as the back of a man's hand, both men and women, and go into
the cold water, or cause it to be poured upon them, and, in Winter, how they wallow in
the Snow. Some of our young men would often walk before these publick stoves, to see the
several postures of the women that came out, and diverted themselves in the water, and were
so far from being asham'd, that they would talk wantonly with them, and were not troubled
when any of our people came into the water to them. And this we saw not only in <hi>Muscovy,</hi>
but also in <hi>Livonia,</hi> where the Inhabitants, especially the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> who are setled there,
going out of these stoves, in the coldest of Winter, run into the Snow, and rub their bodies
with it, as if it were Soap, then return into the stoves to take the advantage of a more moderate
heat: and all this so as that this change of contrary qualities does not any way prejudice their
health. The reason then of it must be Custom, in as much as being thus used from their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and that habit being as it were converted into a second nature, they are indifferently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured
to both heat and cold.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Narva</hi> we had <hi>Muscovian</hi> boys of about 8, 9, or 10. years of age, whom we employ'd
about the Kitchin. These would stand half an hour together barefoot upon the Ice, like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Flowers, which raise a very sweet smell, as also the Ly which they make very odoriferous.
Along the Walls are seats, or benches, upon which a man lies to sweat and be rubb'd, some

                     <p>Fornication is very common among them, and yet they permit not publick stews, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other <hi>Christian</hi> Princes not only permit, but anthorise, and have an advantage arising out
of them for their protection. Marriage is thought honourable among them, and Polygamy
forbidden. A Widdower or Widdow may Marry twice or thrice, but must not offer at a
fourth Marriage, which if they should, the Priest that should bless them would be cast
off.</p>
                     <p>They observe in their Marriages the degrees of Consanguinity, and do not willingly marry
such as are near to them either by Kinred or Allyance. Nor do they permit two Brothers to
marry two Sisters; and they observe also a spiritual Allyance, not suffering that Godfathers
and Godmothers to the same person should intermarry. The celebration of Marriage among
them is thus.</p>

marriage, or to make any promise one to another, by word or writing. But when those who
have Children marriageable, especially daughters, have found out a match they like, they
speak to the young mans Parents, and declare the desire they have to make an Allyance with
them. If they approve of what is proposed, and the young man desire to see the maid, yet is it
absolutly deny'd. If she be hansom, they will be content the mother or some other woman of the

kinred, should see her, and if she be no way defective; that is, neither blind nor lame, the
friends on both sides treat about the marriage, and conclude all things, the intended young
couple not so much as being allow'd to see one another. For they bring up their daughters in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
private Chambers (especially persons of quality) where they keep them lock'd up, so as
that the Bridegroom does not see his Bride till she is brought into his Chamber. And thus it
comes to pass, that he who thinks he hath married a handsom Maid, hath some crooked piece
put upon him; nay, instead of the Mans Daughter he was to have, some kinswoman or servant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
is thrust upon him; of which I have several examples. So that it is not to be wondred at,
that matrimonial discontents are so frequent among them.</p>

married. At his Bride's door, he meets with all her friends, who receive him and his retinue,
and press them to sit down at a Table. Three dishes of meat are serv'd up, but no body eats of
them, and there is left at the upper end of the Table a place for the Bridegroom: but while he
is talking with the Bride's friends, a young Lad sits down in it, and will not be gotten thence till
the Bridegroom hath made him so many Presents, that he is content to give him the place. The
Bridegroom having taken his place, the Bride is brought in most richly Clad, having a Veil
over her face. She is seated by the Bridegroom, but to prevent their seeing one another, they
are separated by a piece of Crimson Taffata, which is held up by two young Lads while they
are set. Thus done, the Bride's <hi>Suacha</hi> comes to her, Paints her, tyes up her hair in two knots,
puts the Crown on her head, and dresses her in all things like a married woman. The Crown
is of leaves of Gold, or Silver Gilt, beaten very thin, lined with some silk stuff, and towards
the Ears, it hath five or six rows of great Pearls, which fall down on her breast. The Robe, or
upper Garment, the sleeves whereof are an Ell and a half wide, is embroider'd with Gold and
Pearls at the extremities, especially at the neck, which is three fingers broad, and so heightned
with Embroidery, that it looks more like a Dogs Collar than any thing else, and this kind of
Robe amounts to above a thousand Crowns. The heels of their shooes, as well of those that
are betroath'd, as of most of the other women and maids, are above half a foot high, so that
being as it were a-tip-toe, they have much ado to stand. The other <hi>Suacha</hi> Paints the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
and in the mean time, the women get up on benches and sings several foolish songs.
After this come in two young men richly Clad, carrying between them upon a Beer a very large
Cheese, and some Loaves, there hanging from the Beer several Martins skins. The like is
brought in on the Bride's part, and the Priest, having blessed them, sends them to Church. At
last there is set on the Table a great Silver-basin, fill'd with little pieces of Satin and Taffata,
about such a bigness as were fit to make little purses of, little square pieces of Silver, Hops,
Barley, and Oats; all mixt together. The <hi>Suacha</hi> having cover'd the Brides face again, takes
certain handfuls out of the Basin, and casts them among the company, who in the mean time
sing a song, and take up what they find upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>In the Church,<note place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Church.</note> where the Benediction is to be given, they cover some part of the floor with
Crimson Taffata, upon which the young Couple stand, having over them another piece of the
same stuff. Before they are married, the Priest makes them go to the offering, which consists in
Fish, Fry'd Meats, and Pastry. That done, the married receive the Benediction, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by holding Images over their heads, and the Priest taking the man by the right hand, and
the woman by the left at the same time, asks them three times, whether it is with their consent
that they are married, and whether they will love one another as they ought to do. Having
both answer'd, yes, all the Company joyn hands, and the Priest sings the 128. Psalm, he one
verse, and the Company the next, dancing at the mean time, much after the same manner as
they do in these parts, who sing and dance at the same time. The Psalm ended, he puts a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of Rue upon their heads, or about their shoulders, if it be a Widdow or Widdower, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Increase and Multiply,</hi> and then consummates the marriage, pronouncing these words,
<hi>Whom God hath joyned together let no man separate.</hi> While the Priest pronounces those words,
those who are invited to the Wedding do all light wax candles, and one of them gives the Priest,
a wooden Cup, or rather a Glass, full of Claret Wine which he takes off, and when the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Couple have pledg'd him by drinking it off, each of them three times, the Bridegroom
throws down the Cup or Glass, and he and the Bride treading it under their feet, break it to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47786:52"/>
pieces, with these words, <hi>May they thus fall at our feet, and be trod to pieces, who shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to sow division or discontent between us.</hi> Then the Women cast at the young Couple some
Flax-seed and Hemp-seed, and wish them all prosperity. They also pull the Bride by the Robe,
as if they would force her away from her husband, but she keeps so close to him, that all their
endeavours prove fruitless. The Marriage-Ceremonies being thus over, the Bride is put into
her Sledge, which is encompass'd with six Torches, or Wax-candles, and the Bridegroom gets
on horse-back to return to his own house, where the Wedding is kept.</p>
                     <p>As soon as they are come thither, the Bridegroom, his kindred and friends sit down at a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
well furnish'd with Meat, but the Women carry the Bride to her Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mber, take off her
cloaths, and lay her a-bed. That done, they make the Bridegroom rise from the Table, and
six or eight young men, carrying each a Torch in his hand, conduct him to the Chamber. As
they come in, they put the Torches into the barrels full of Wheat and Barley, and quit the
room. They are each of them presented with two Martins skins. The Bride perceiving the
Bridegroom coming, gets out of bed, gets on a morning Gown lin'd with Martins skins, meets
him, and receives him very submissively, doing him reverence with a low inclination of the
head; and this is the first time that he sees the Bride's face. They sit down together at a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and, among other Meat, there is brought them a roasted fowl, which the Bridegroom
pulls asunder, casting away over his shoulders that part which comes off first, whether it be
wing or leg, and eating the other. Having eaten, the young Couple go to bed, and all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
save only one of the old servants of the house, who walks before the Chamber-door,
while the kindred and friends are busied about all manner of charms, which they think may be
advantageous to the New-married Couple.</p>
                     <p>This servant coming ever and anon to the door, asks whether the business be done. As soon
as the Bridegroom answers that it is, the Trumpets and Timbrels which only expect the word,
are plaid upon, and make an excellent noise, till such time as the stoves are made ready, where
the New-married-couple bath themselves, but apart. They are wash'd with water, Hydromel
and Wine, and the Bride sends to the Bridegroom a shirt, embroider'd with Gold and Pearls at
the collar and extremities, and a rich habit. The two next dayes are spent in entertainments,
dancing, and other divertisements, the Women making their advantage of the opportunity,
while their husbands are drunk, to the loss of their honours.</p>
                     <p>Citizens, and persons of meaner condition are married with less Ceremonie. The night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Wedding the young Man sends to his intended Bride some cloaths, a furr'd Coif, a
pair of Buskins, a Cabinet with certain Jewels, a Bag for night cloaths, a Comb and a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glass.
The next day, the Priest is sent for, who comes with a little Silver Cross, and is
brought in by two young Lads carrying Wax-candles lighted. As he enters the house, he gives
the benediction with his Cross, first, to the two Lads, then to those that are invited. Then the
young Couple are set at Table, the two Lads holding a piece of Taffata between them; but
when the <hi>Suacha</hi> dresses the Brides head, a Looking-glass is brought, and the young Couple
joyning their cheeks, look and smile one upon the other. The two <hi>Suacha's</hi> in the mean time
cast hops upon them; which done, they are led to Church, where the Ceremonies are the same
as for persons of quality.</p>
                     <p>As soon as the Wedding is over,<note place="margin">How the Women live.</note> the Women must resolve to live a retir'd life, and not go
out of the house but very seldom, receiving the visits of their kindred and friends oftener than
they give any. The Daughters of great Persons, and rich Merchants, as they are not much
brought up to house-keeping, so they trouble themselves but little with it, when they are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
Their chief employment is sowing, or embroidering handkerchers of white Taffata, or
cloath, or making little purses, or some such toies. The cloaths they wear within doors are
made of some common stuff of little value; but when they go to Church, or that their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
would honour a friend with their presence, they are magnificently clad, and forget not to
paint their faces, necks, and arms.</p>
                     <p>The Wives of the <hi>Knez, Bojares,</hi> and great Lords, in the Summer time, make use of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
cover'd with red cloath, which kind of covering they use in Winter for their Sledges, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at their feet a she S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>0. or 40. The horse, which draws them, hath many Fox tails about
the main and tail, which disguise him after a strange manner; and yet the <hi>Muscovits</hi> think it so
ornamental, that not only Great Lords and Ladies make use of it, but many times the Great
Duke himself, with this difference, that instead of Fox tails, they some times use Martins
skins.</p>
                     <p>The Women living thus idly,<note place="margin">Their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> making few or no visits, and not medling with any thing of
housewivery, are forc'd to divert themselves with their Maids. They lay a long plank over
a block, and getting up on the ends of it, they are toss'd up and down, and sometimes by a
violent motion they are forc'd up very high in the Air. They have also ropes to swing in;
nay in some little Towns and Villages I have seen publick Swinging-places, so contriv'd as
that three or four might have their divertisement at the same time. They are not asham'd to do
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47786:53"/>
this in the open streets, giving two or three pence to little Boys who keep Swingers ready for
that purpose. Their husbands are very glad to give them this kind of sport, and sometimes help
them in their swinging.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be much wondred that they are so hardly treated by their husbands,<note place="margin">Why the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> beat their wives</note> for they have
lewd tongues, are given to Wine, and will not let slip the opportunity to pleasure a friend. So
that having all these three excellent qualities, they cannot take much unkindly the cudgelings,
which they from time to time receive from their husbands: but they take comfort from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of their friends and neighbours, who, behaving themselves after the same manner, are
accordingly no better treated. Yet can I not believe, what <hi>Barclay</hi> says in his <hi>Icon Ammorum,</hi>
That the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Women are not perswaded their husbands love them, if they are not beaten
by them; at least I can say this, I never met with any who were glad when they were beaten.
They have the same passions and inclinations as other Women have. They are sensible of good
and bad usage, and it is not likely they should take the effects of anger and displeasure for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of kindness and friendship.</p>
                     <p>It is possible some foolish Woman might tell her husband so in jest, or that one distracted
might desire to be beaten, such as she of whom <hi>Petrejus,</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> speaks
of, who having lived many years in good correspondence with her husband (who was an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
as he says, though the Baron of <hi>Haberstein</hi> affirms he was a <hi>German,</hi> and by profession,
a Black-smith, named <hi>Iordan</hi>) told him one day, that she could not believe he loved her, since
he had not yet beaten her. The husband willing to assure her of his real affection gave her a good
cudgelling, and perceiving she took a certain pleasure in it, made use of that exercise so often,
till at last she died. But were it granted that this is but a story, as it seems to be no other, yet
ought we not to judge of all the <hi>Muscovian</hi> women by this particular example.</p>
                     <p>They think,<note place="margin">Adultery.</note> that Adultry is not committed but when one man marries another mans wife:
what ever else may be done amounts but to fornication, and when a married man is taken in it,
his punishment is whipping, and some days imprisonment, or haply he is sentenc'd to live some
time on bread and water. Then he is set at liberty, and may resent the complaints made by his
wife against him upon that occasion. A husband who can convince his wife of a miscarriage of
this nature, may have her shav'd, and put into a Monastery. Those who are weary of their
wives, often make use of this pretence, accuse their wives of Adultery, and suborn false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
upon whose depositions they are condemn'd, without being heard. Religious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are sent to her lodgings, who put her into their habit, shave her, and carry her away by
force into the Monastery, whence she never comes out, having once suffer'd the Razour to
come upon her head.</p>
                     <p>The most ordinary cause of divorce; at least the most plausible pretence, is <hi>devotion.</hi> They
say, they love God better than their wives, when an humour takes them to go into a Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
which they do without their consent, or making any provision for the children they have
had between them. And yet this kind of retiring out of the World is so much approv'd among
them, (though St. <hi>Paul</hi> says that such are worse than Heathens and Infidels) that if the woman
marry again, they make no difficulty to conferr Priesthood on this new Proselite, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had been but a Tayler, or Shoemaker. Barrenness is also another cause of divorce in
<hi>Muscovy:</hi> for he who hath no children by his wife may put her into a Monastery, and marry
again within six weeks.</p>
                     <p>The Great Dukes themselves make use of this freedom, when they have only Daughters. 'Tis
true, the Great Duke <hi>Basili</hi> did not put his Wife <hi>Salome</hi> into a Monastery, and marry <hi>Helene,</hi>
daughter to <hi>Michael Linski,</hi> a <hi>Polander,</hi> but upon his having no Children one and twenty
years after marriage; but it is also true; that, some few days after, she was brought to bed of
a Son, and yet she was forc'd to continue there, because she had been shaved.</p>
                     <p>We saw an example of it in a <hi>Polander,</hi> who, having embrac'd the <hi>Greek</hi> Religion, purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to marry a <hi>Muscovian</hi> beauty, was forc'd to take a journey into <hi>Poland,</hi> where he stay'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a year. The young Lady, in her husband's absence, made a shift to be otherwise supply'd;
so effectually that she augmented her family by a child; but, fearing her husband's displeasure,
she retir'd into a Monastery and was shaved. The husband did all he could to get her out again,
promising to pardon her offence, and never to reproach her with it. The woman was willing
to come out, but would not be permitted, it being, according to their Theology, a sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Holy Ghost, not to be forgiven either in this World or the next. This artifice <hi>Boris
Federouits Gudenou</hi> made use of, who, having acquired much repute in the management of the
publick affairs, during the minority of <hi>Foedor Iuanouits,</hi> and perceiving the <hi>Muscovites</hi> were
not fully resolv'd to make him Great Duke, to make them the more earnest to do it, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he would turn Monk, and went into a Monastery, where his Sister was a Nun. As soon
as the <hi>Muscovites</hi> heard of it, they came in multitudes to the Monastery, cast themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ground, tore their hair, as being in a desperate condition, intreated him not to be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and that he would be pleas'd to take the place of their deceased Prince. He, at first, would
not hearken to them, but at last pretended himself overcome by their intreaties, and his Sister's
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47786:53"/>
intercession, by which means he came to be courted, to what he had not haply got otherwise,
with all the subtlety he could have used.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muscovites</hi> are extremely venereous,<note place="margin">Their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</note> yet will not have to do with a Woman, but they
must first take off the little Cross which is hang'd about her neck when she is Christened: nor
would they do it in a place where there are any Images of their Saints, till they had covered them.
They go not to Church the day they have dealt with a Woman, till they have wash'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and chang'd their shirts. Those that are more devout go not into it at all, but say their
prayers at the door. Priests are permitted to come into the Church the same day, provided they
have wash'd themselves above and below the navil, but dare not approach the Altar. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are accompted more impure than the men, and therefore they ordinarily stay at the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door
all service time. He who lies with his wife in Lent may not Communicate that year; and
if a Priest commit that offence, he is suspended for a year: but if one that pretends to Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
be so unhappy as to fall into it, he can never recover himself, but must quit his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p>Their remedy against this kind of uncleanness is rather bathing than repentance, which is the
reason they use the former upon all occasions. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who personated the son of the Great
Duke <hi>Iohn Basilouits,</hi> who had been kill'd long before at <hi>Vglits,</hi> never bath'd himself, upon
which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> suspected him to be a stranger. For perceiving he would not make use
of a bath made ready for him eight dayes after his marriage, they conceiv'd a horror against him,
as a Heathen and profane person, sought divers other pretences, set upon him in the Castle, and
kill'd him the 19. day after his Wedding, as we shall shew hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The politick Government of <hi>Muscovy</hi> is <hi>Monarchical</hi> and <hi>despotical.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.</hi>
                        </note> The Great Duke is the
hereditary Soveraign of it, and so absolute, that no <hi>Knez</hi> or Lord in all his Dominions, but
thinks it an honour to assume the quality of his Majesties <hi>Golop,</hi> or slave. No Master hath more
power over his slaves, than the Great Duke hath over his Subjects, what condition or quality
soever they be of. So that <hi>Muscovy</hi> may be numbred among those States, whereof <hi>Aristotle</hi>
speaks, when he sayes there is a kind of <hi>Monarchy</hi> among the Barbarians which comes near
<hi>Tyranny.</hi> For since there is no other difference between a legitimate Government and Tyranny,
than that, in the one, the welfare of the Subjects is of greatest consideration, in the other, the
particular profit and advantage of the Prince, we must allow, that <hi>Muscovy</hi> inclines much to
Tyranny. We said before, that the greatest Lords think it not below them to put their names
in the diminutive; nor is it long since that for a small matter, they were whipt, like slaves, but
now their lesser miscarriages are punish'd with two or three dayes imprisonment.</p>
                     <p>They give their Soveraign the quality of <hi>Welikoi Knez,</hi>

Whence it is that they would also imitate the Emperours of <hi>Germany</hi> in their great seal,<note place="margin">The <hi>Czaar's</hi> Arms.</note> which
had a Spread-Eagle, but the wings not so large as the Imperial Eagle's, having on the breast, in

The Great Dukes Interpreters, and the <hi>Germans,</hi> who live at <hi>Moscou,</hi> call him in
their language <hi>Kaysar,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Caesar</hi> or Emperour. But it is certain, the word <hi>Czaar</hi>
signifies <hi>King,</hi> which may be seen in their Bible, where the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> speaking of <hi>David</hi> and
his Successors, Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> they call them <hi>Czaars.</hi> The Great Duke is indeed
King in effect, since other Princes stick not to treat him with the word <hi>Majesty;</hi> the title of
Great Duke being much below what that great Prince deserves. Nor accordingly does he take
the quality of Great Duke, when he assumes that of of <hi>Welikoi Knez,</hi> but that of <hi>Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur,</hi>
as well as the Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> with whom he may be parallel'd, not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the extent of his Empire, but also by reason of the absolute power he hath over his
Subjects.</p>
                     <p>No people in the World have a greater veneration for their Prince than the <hi>Muscovites,</hi>
who from their infancy are taught to speak of the <hi>Czaar,</hi> as of God himself, not only in their

their submissive forms of speaking, <hi>The honour to see the brightness of the eyes of his</hi> Czaarick
<hi>Majesty; Only God and the</hi> Czaar <hi>knows it; All they have belong to God and the</hi> Czaar. The

/which other Nations about them enjoy, the <hi>Muscovites</hi> are, upon pain of death, prohibited to
go out of the Countrey, without the Great Duke's express permission. <hi>Iohn Helmes,</hi> the

send his son into <hi>Germany,</hi> to study Physick, where he afterwards grew famous: but the young

when <hi>Peter Miklaf,</hi> a Merchant of <hi>Novogorod,</hi> whom the Great Duke sent into <hi>Germany,</hi>
3 years since, in the quality of <hi>Poslanick,</hi> desired his Majesty would permit him to leave his son

the goodness to provide for such as are banish'd into <hi>Siberia</hi> for their Crimes, allowing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of quality, money; finding employment for those that are capable of it; and disposing
Soldiers into some place where they have Pensions or ordinary pay during life. So that what is
most insupportable to them, when they are out of favour, is, that they have not the honour <hi>to
see the bright eyes of his</hi> Czaarick <hi>Majesty.</hi> For, were it no for that, this is become so mild
a punishment, that many have, in their exile, got that wealth, which they could not have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

                     <p>When we said the state of <hi>Muscovy</hi> was <hi>Monarchical;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Great Dukes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute power.</note> we presuppose that the Prince is a
<hi>Monarch,</hi> and hath, alone, all the prerogatives of Soveraignty. He is not subject to the Laws;
he only makes them, and all the <hi>Muscovites</hi> obey him, with so great submission, that they
are so far from opposing his will, that they say, the Justice and word of their Prince is sacred
and inviolable.</p>
                     <p>He only creates Magistrates, and deposes them, ejects them, and orders them to be punish'd,
with such absolute power, that we may say of the Great Duke, what the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> says,
of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> That, <hi>he put to death whom he would, and saved whom he would.</hi> He
appoints Governours and Lieutenants for the Provinces, for the disposal of the antient Demesn,
and Administration of Justice, who have, joyned with them, a <hi>Deak,</hi> or Secretary: and
these take Cognizance of all matters, give final and absolute judgement in all causes, and cause
their sentences to be put in execution, without any appeal.</p>
                     <p>And in this the Great Duke follows the advice of the best Politicians,<note place="margin">Changes the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Provinces every three years.</note> who are so far from
allowing a survivancy in Governments, that they would have a Soveraign, (that it might be
in his power to punish the miscarriages committed by great ones in their Governments, and
prevent their making intrigues to settle themselves in the Provinces) to change the Governours
from three years to three years.</p>
                     <p>He alone hath the power to make War and Peace with other Princes. For though he takes
the advice of his <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojares,</hi> yet does he not always follow it, but makes them know,
that notwithstanding the freedom he gives them to advise him, he reserves to himself the power
of doing what he thinks fit.</p>
                     <p>He only confers Honours, and rewards the services that are done him with the qualities of
<hi>Knez, Bojares,</hi> Dukes or Princes; and whereas the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have heard, that it is a mark
of Soveraignty in <hi>Germany,</hi> to make Doctors, the Great Duke meddles with that also, and
grants Letters Patents to Physicians and Surgeons, that are Strangers.</p>

form, and little. The greatest piece is worth but a peny, and is called a <hi>Copec,</hi> or <hi>Denaing.</hi>

                     <p>He only levies Taxes and impositions, and regulates them according to his pleasure, so as

                     <p>It is his prerogative to send Ambassadors,<note place="margin">Muscovian <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</hi>
                        </note> to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Poland, Denmark,

Courriers, or <hi>Poslanicks,</hi> Envoys. Heretofore, especially in the time of <hi>Iohn Basilouits,</hi> they
treated Strangers, even the publick Ministers of Princes, with much disrespect; but now it is
otherwise. Ambassadors are entertain'd with great civility; and their charges defray'd from
the day of their entrance into the Great Duke's Dominions, to that of their departure thence;
they are treated at great feasts, and have very rich Presents bestow'd on them. Whence it comes,
that other <hi>Europaean</hi> Princes make no difficulty to send their Ambassadors thither, nay some
have their ordinary Residents there, as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Sueden.</hi> All the Presents
made by the Great Duke consist in Furrs, and he never sends any solemn Embassy, but it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
such as are very considerable for the Prince to whom it is sent. Those which the Great Duke
<hi>Foedor Iuanouits</hi> sent, in the year 1595. to the Emperour <hi>Rodolph</hi> II. were very remarkable,<note place="margin">A remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</note>
which amounted to above a Million of Livers, or 100000. sterl. <hi>viz.</hi> onethousand and three
<hi>Zimmers</hi> (which we have said elsewhere, makes twenty pair, and in worth about 100.
Crowns in <hi>Muscovy</hi>) of Sables, five hundred and nineteen <hi>Zimmers</hi> of ordinary Martins, six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
black-Fox-skins, three hundred thirty seven thousand ordinary Fox-skins, three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Beavers, a thousand Wolf-skins, and sixty four Elk's-skins. The <hi>Poslanicks</hi> make no
Present from the Great Duke, but upon their own account they do, as baits to draw in others,
and if they are not given them, they will have the boldness to ask for them. They defray fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Ambassadors, not only as to provisions, but also provide for the carriage of them, and
what ever they bring; and there are upon the Road appointed stages for the accommodation of
their travelling, where the Peasants are oblig'd to be ready with a certain number of Horses,
and to come upon the first order sent them. Nor is this done with any grievance to those Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants;
for besides a salary of 60 Crowns <hi>per an.</hi> duly paid them, they have land enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
them for their subsistence. They are freed from Taxes, and all other Charges, and have
the allowance of some <hi>Altins</hi> every journey they make. By this means we travell'd from <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogorod</hi>
to <hi>Moscou,</hi> above 120. <hi>German</hi> leagues, in six or seven days, and in the Winter in
four or five. 'Tis true, the Houses where the Ambassadors are lodg'd, are so poorly furnish'd,
that unless a man will be content to ly on the ground or upon a bench, he must bring a Bed with
him: but the <hi>Muscovites</hi> themselves are no better accomodated. Heretofore they shut up the
Ambassadors and their retinue in their lodgings, kept them in as Prisoners, and set Sentinels at
the door to hinder them from coming out; or if they permitted some of their people to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
into the City, they were accompany'd by <hi>Strelits,</hi> who observed all their actions: but
now they are kept in only till the first Audience, and in the mean they are visited and entertain'd
by two <hi>Pristafs,</hi> whose office it is, to see them supply'd with all things necessary. These take
occasion to ask the Ambassadors, what the design of their Embassy is, as also to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
whether they have any Presents for the Great Duke, and in what they consist, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
to ask whether they have also any for them. As soon as the Ambassadors have delivered
in their Presents, the Great Duke causes them to be valu'd by persons that know their worth.
Heretofore, the Ambassadors were entertain'd, after their first publick Audience, in the Great
Duke's Chamber, at his own Table; but some years since this custom was abolish'd, and they
send, to their Lodgings, the Meat design'd for their treatment. All Ambassadors who bring
Presents thither, receive others for themselves and their retinue; nay they give Presents to
Gentlemen who come thither as Envoys, and to all those that bring but so much as a Letter
from a forein Prince. To make a fuller discovery of the Political Government of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> it
will not be much from our purpose, by a short digression, to give an account of what hath
pass'd there within this three hundred years.</p>

that noble quality, of a <hi>Good and Devout Christian;</hi> since that it may, without any injury to

execute the Functions of Monks and Priests: but he abus'd both God and Men, and had not
sentiments of humanity, so far was he from having any of piety. He had seven lawful wives,
and by the first, two sons, <hi>Iuan</hi> and <hi>Foedor,</hi> that is, <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Theodore.</hi> Being once very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry

Kingdom was conferr'd on <hi>Boris Gudenou,</hi> High-Steward of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and Brother in law to
the Great Duke, <hi>Salomon Henning,</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>Livonia,</hi> says, that this <hi>Foedor</hi> was
so simple, that he could find himself no greater divertisement than tolling of the Bells before
Service.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>Boris Gudenou</hi> knew so well how to answer the good opinion conceived of
him, and to insinuate himself into the affection of the people, that some stuck not to say, that
if God should be pleased to dispose otherwise of the two hereditary Princes, it was not to be
doubred, but they would call in him, who gave so many demonstrations of an excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
During the regency, <hi>Boris,</hi> perceiving that <hi>Demetrius</hi> was the more likely to stand in
his way, resolv'd to remove him out of it. This young Prince was but nine years old, brought
up in the City of <hi>Vglits,</hi> whither a Gentleman belonging to <hi>Boris</hi> went, and kill'd him with
his own hands. But instead of receiving the great reward he expected for his pains, <hi>Boris</hi> caus'd
him and all the Complices to be kill'd as soon as they were return'd to <hi>Moscou.</hi> By this exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Murtherers, he, for some time, kept undiscovered the true Author of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
but, to prevent the people from conceiving him any way engag'd in it, by giving them a
greater cause of affliction, he caus'd several houses to be set a-fire, and so consum'd a great part
of the City; while, on the other side, he ordered the Castle of <hi>Vglits</hi> to be demolish'd, and
banish'd the Inhabitants, as if they had countenanc'd the murther, and sheltred the murtherers.
The weakness of <hi>Foedor Iuanouits,</hi> sensible, though of nothing else, yet of his own weakness,
left the management of all affairs, to <hi>Boris,</hi> who was in effect what the other had only the
name and appearance of, yet did he not think it fit to be over-forward, but let some years pass
on, after which, <hi>Foedor</hi> fell suddenly sick, in the year 1597. and died without children, having
reigned twelve years.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Boris</hi> was presently look'd upon.<note place="margin">Boris Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denou.</note> He, to divert the popular jealousie, was so crafty, as, in
appearance, to refuse the Royal Dignity, and, as we have said before, to fly into a Monastery,
while his Election to the Dukedom was, according to his secret instructions, press'd by some
friends, by whose opportunity he seem'd to be overcome, and to accept the Crown.</p>
                     <p>In the reign of <hi>Boris</hi> happened a very remarkable thing, through the imposture of a <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>
Monk, named <hi>Griska Vtropoja,</hi> born at <hi>Gereslau,</hi> of a Noble house, but not very rich, one
that had been thrust into a Monastery for his debauches, and lew'd life. He was a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
person, and had an excellent Wit, which qualities an old Monk of the same Monastery
made his advantage of, to put this Impostor into the World, and advance him to the Throne.
The better to carry on his design, he made him leave the Monastery, and go into <hi>Lithuania,</hi>
where he was entertain'd by a Great Lord, named <hi>Adam Wesnewetski,</hi> into whose favour he in
a short insinuated himself, by his ingenuity, and the constancy of his services. One day his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
being angry with him, call'd him <hi>Bledinsin,</hi> or Son of a Whore, and struck him. <hi>Griska</hi>
making his advantage of that disgrace, fell a weeping, and told his Master, that if he knew who
he was, he would not call him Son of a Whore, nor treat him in that manner. The curiosity of
the <hi>Polish</hi> Lord was so great, as to press <hi>Greska</hi> to tell him who he was. The Impostor made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that he was lawful Son to the Great Duke <hi>Iohn Basilouits,</hi> that <hi>Boris Gudenou</hi> would have
murther'd him, but the misfortune fell upon a Priest's Son very like him, whom his friends had
substituted in his place, while he was convey'd away. He thereupon shews a golden Cross beset
with precious stones, which he said was hung about his neck at his Baptism. Adding that the
fear of falling into the hands of <hi>Boris Gudenou</hi> had kept him from discovering himself till then.
Upon which he casts himself at his Lords feet, and intreats him to take him into his protection,
enlivening his relation with so many circumstances, and his actions with so much shew of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that his Master, perswaded he spoke nothing but truth, immediately furnish'd him with
Cloaths, Horses, and attendance befitting the greatness of a Prince of that quality. The noise
of it spreads over all the Country, finds credit every where, and the presumption grows so much
the stronger, by reason the Great Duke <hi>Boris Gudenou</hi> proffers a great sum of mony, to any that
should bring in that counterfeit <hi>Demetrius</hi> alive or dead. His Master, not thinking him safe at
his house, sends him into <hi>Poland,</hi> where he is receiv'd by the <hi>Weywode</hi> of <hi>Sandomira,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
him a sufficient assistance to restore him to his Throne, upon condition he would tolerate
the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> as soon as he had setled himself in the Government
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47786:55"/>
thereof. <hi>Demetrius</hi> not only accepted of that condition, but, being secretly instructed, chang'd
his Religion, and promised to marry the <hi>Weywode</hi>'s Daughter, as soon as he should be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd.
The hope of so advantageous an allyance, and the zeal the <hi>Weywode</hi> had for his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
engag'd him to employ his credit and friends, by whose means he got together a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Army, enter'd <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and declared a War against the Great Duke. He took in several
Cities, debauch'd and corrupted most of the Officers employ'd by <hi>Boris</hi> against him, and grew
so prosperous, that the grief <hi>Boris</hi> conceived thereat struck him so to the heart, that he died of
it, <hi>Apr.</hi> 13. 1605. The <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Foedor Borissouits</hi> to be crowned,<note place="margin">Foedor Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissouits.</note> though very young: but reflecting on the continual success of
<hi>Demetriu</hi>'s Arms, their minds chang'd, and deriving, from his victories, an ill presage against
the new Great Duke, they concluded, that he must be the true <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the lawful Son of
<hi>Iohn Basilouits,</hi> and that they did ill to take up arms against their natural Sovereign. It was no
hard matter to insinuate this into the people, who presently cry'd, <hi>Live</hi> Demetrius, <hi>true Heir
of the Kingdom, and may his Enemies perish.</hi> Whereupon they ran to the Castle, seis'd upon
the young Great Duke, imprison'd him, ransacked, misused, and forc'd away all the kindred
and friends of <hi>Boris Gudenou,</hi> and at the same time sent to intreat <hi>Demetrius</hi> to come as soon as
he pleas'd, and take possession of the Kingdom of his Ancestors. They also begg'd his pardon
for what they had done through ignorance, upon the instigation of <hi>Boris,</hi> assured him of their
affection and obedience, and as a pledge of their fidelity, they profer'd to put into his hands the
deceased Duke's Son, his Mother, and all his Family, to be disposed of as he should think it.
Upon these overtures <hi>Demetrius</hi> sent a <hi>Deak,</hi> or Secretary named <hi>Iuan Bogdanou,</hi> with order
to strangle the Mother and Son, and to give out that they were poison'd. Which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly

                        <hi>Demetrius</hi> came to <hi>Moscou,</hi> with his Army, which strangely
encreased as he came along. The whole City went out to meet him, and made him Presents.
He was Crown'd the 21. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> with extrtordinary Ceremonies. And that there might be no
question made of the lawfulness of his birth, he sent for the Mother of the true <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
whom <hi>Boris Gudenou</hi> had shut up in a Monastery, at a great distance from <hi>Moscou.</hi> He went to
meet her with a Noble retinue of Courtiers, lodg'd her in the Castle, where he caused her to
be treated with all magnificence, visiting her every day, and doing her all the honour a Mother
could expect from a Son. The good Lady knew well enough, that <hi>Demetrius,</hi> her Son, had
been kill'd, but she cunningly dissembled it, as well out of the resentment she had against the
memory of <hi>Boris Gudenou,</hi> and the fear she was in to be ill-treated by this counterfeit <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
as for that she was not a little pleas'd to see her self so much honour'd, and enjoy the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a happy life, after the miseries and afflictions she had endured in the Monastery, since her
Son's death.</p>
                     <p>But when the <hi>Muscovites</hi> found his manner of life different from that of the Great Dukes his
predecessors,<note place="margin">A conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the counterfeit <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi>

daughter, and ransack'd the Treasuries of the Kingdom to furnish her according to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
she expected, they began to mistrust him, and to perceive they had been mistaken. One of
the principal <hi>Knez,</hi> named <hi>Vasili Zuski,</hi> was the first that offer'd to speak of it to some other
Lords, as well Ecclesiastical as Secular, and to remonstrate to them the danger whereto both
the State and Religion were expos'd, by the Alliance which that Counterfeit intended to make
with a strange woman, and of a contrary Religion; adding, that, of necessity, he was an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor,
and a lewd person. Upon this it was resolv'd he should be dispatch'd out of the way:
but the Conspiracy being discover'd, and <hi>Zuski</hi> taken, <hi>Demetrius</hi> got him sentenc'd to death,
but sent him a pardon upon the point of execution, hoping by that mildness, to gain the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Muscovites.</hi> Accordingly all was quiet till the day of his marriage, which was the
8. of <hi>May,</hi> 1606. The Bride being arriv'd, with a great number of <hi>Poles,</hi> Armed, and in a
capacity to become Masters of the City, the <hi>Muscovites</hi> began to open their eyes. <hi>Zuski</hi> got
to his own house, several <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojares,</hi> propos'd to their consideration the present State of
Affairs, the unavoidable ruine of both State and Religion, and, profer'd, for the preservation
thereof, once more to expose his person and life. They gave him thanks, and promis'd to assist
him with their Persons and Estates, when there should be an opportunity to put their design in

the Wedding, and the 17. of <hi>May.</hi> The Great Duke and his Company being got drunk
and asleep, the <hi>Muscovites</hi> caused all the Bells in the City to be rung, as they are wont in case
of fire, to give an Alarm, whereupon they immediately put themselves into Arms, and set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Castle, where, having defeated the <hi>Polish</hi> Guards, and forc'd the Gates, they entred
the Great Dukes Chamber, who thought to avoid present death by leaping out at a window in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Court, in hope to save himself among the Guards, which were still there in Arms: but
he was taken, and cruelly us'd. The Castle was ransack'd. <hi>Zuski,</hi> addressing himself to the
pretended Mother of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> oblig'd her to swear by the <hi>Cross,</hi> whether <hi>Demetrius</hi> was her
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47786:56"/>
Son, or no, to which having answer'd, that he was not, and that she never had but one Son,
who had been unfortunately murther'd, they shot the Counterfeit <hi>Demetrius</hi> in the head with
a Pistol.<note place="margin">Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>kill'd.</hi>
                        </note> They imprison'd the pretended Great Dutchess, with her Father and Brother, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the <hi>Polish</hi> Ambassador. The Ladies and Gentlewomen were abus'd and deflour'd, and above
1700. men kill'd, among whom were many Jewellers, Merchants, who had abundance of
Jewels about them. <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s body was stripp'd, and dragg'd to the place before the Castle,
where it lay expos'd for three whole days. After which they buried it, but it was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken up again, to be burnt, and reduc'd to ashes.</p>
                     <p>This conspiracy thus succeeding, the <hi>Muscovites</hi> chose into the place of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Knez
<hi>Basilouits Zuski,</hi>

was no sooner got into the Throne, ere another Impostor disputed the possession of it. His name
was <hi>Knez Gregori Schacopski,</hi> who at the pillaging of the Castle, having found the Seals of the
Kingdom, fell into a League with two <hi>Polauders,</hi> and made a shift to go into <hi>Poland.</hi> He made
use of the same invention as his Predecessor, and took the name of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> giving out, where
he came, that he had escap'd the Massacre, in the night time, that they had kill'd another in
his stead, and that he was going into <hi>Poland</hi> to raise another Army, to punish the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
for their infidelity and ingratitude.</p>
                     <p>About the same time started up another <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A third Impostor.</note> in the City of <hi>Moscou.</hi> He was Clerk
to one of the Secretaries of State, got into the field, made use of the same imposture as the two
others, and found abetters, by whose assistance he became Master of many great Cities. This
occasion'd many other disorders, which the <hi>Polanders</hi> countenanc'd out of their resentment of
the affront they had receiv'd from the <hi>Muscovites.</hi> The events of the War, occasioned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
prov'd so fatal and unhappy, that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> quarrell'd at <hi>Zuski,</hi> and look'd upon
him as the sole cause of all their misfortunes. They said, his Government was unjust, because
unfortunate, and that there must needs be something fatal in his person, when victory seem'd
to shun him, to side with his Enemies. Three <hi>Muscovian</hi> Lords, <hi>Zacchary Lippanow, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Molsaneck,</hi> and <hi>Iuan Kesefski,</hi> were the first that amus'd the people with these reports,
and, perceiving they were well receiv'd among them, proceeded in their design, depriv'd <hi>Zus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki</hi>
of his Dignity, shut him up in a Monastery, and had him shaved.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, the <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojares,</hi> to avoid the jealousie, which the Election might raise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, resolv'd to take in a forein Prince. The <hi>Polanders</hi> still countenanc'd the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> so far as that they forc'd the former's Widow to acknowledge him for her
husband, and expected satisfaction for the affront they had received at <hi>Moscou,</hi> at the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> so that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> willing to satisfie the <hi>Polanders,</hi> and not finding any

                        <note place="margin">Uladislaus <hi>Prince of</hi> Poland <hi>chosen</hi> Czaar <hi>of</hi> Muscovy.</note> eldest son to <hi>Sigismond</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> sent
to the King, his father, to desire, that he might accept of the Crown of <hi>Muscovy.</hi> The King
consented; but the Treaty agreed upon, among other Clauses, had this, that <hi>Iohn Basilouits
Zuski</hi> should be taken out of the Monastery, and, with some other Lords of his Kinred, should
be put into the hands of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who kept them, a long time, Prisoners at <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko,</hi>
where <hi>Zuski,</hi> at last, died, and his body was buried near the High-way, between <hi>Thorn</hi>
and <hi>Warsaw. Stanilaus Solkouski</hi> was, in the mean time, advanc'd with his Army to the very
Gates of <hi>Moscou,</hi> with order to revenge the death of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and the <hi>Polanders,</hi> who were
Massacred with him. But news coming of the conclusion of the Treaty, they laid down their
Arms, and <hi>Stanislaus</hi> had order, in the Prince's name, to receive homage from the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
and to stay at <hi>Moscou,</hi> till the Prince were come thither in person. The <hi>Muscovites</hi>
were content, and, having taken the Oath of Allegiance, they reciprocally administred it to
him, and permitted him, with a thousand <hi>Poles,</hi> to enter the Castle, and to keep a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
there. The rest of the Army stay'd without the City, not doing any thing at which the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> might conceive any jealousie. On the contrary, there was much kindness shewn on
both sides, till that the <hi>Poles,</hi> having crept by degeees into the City, to the number of above
six thousand, took up the Avenues of the Castle for their quarters, and began to incommodate
the Citizens, and to become insupportable, by reason of their insolences, and the violences
they dayly committed upon Women and Maids,<note place="margin">The <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
                        </note> nay, upon the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Saints, at which
they shot off their Pistols. So that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> not able to endure them any longer, and
impatient for their Great Duke, met together on the 24. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1611. in the place before
the Castle, where they made a noise, and complained of the outrages which they daily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the <hi>Polanders,</hi> saying, it was impossible for them to maintain so great a number of
Soldiers, that their Trade was destroy'd, that they were exhausted to the least drop of their
blood, that the new Great Duke came not, which made them apprehend, there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ominous in it; that they could live no longer at that rate, and that they should be forc'd
to those remedies, which nature had furnish'd them with, for their safety, if some other
course were not taken.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Polish</hi> General did all he could to appease them,<note place="margin">An insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection at <hi>Moscou.</hi>
                        </note> causing to be severely punish'd some of

                        <pb facs="tcp:47786:56"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:47786:57"/>

on their side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fearing a general insurrection, doubled their Guards, possess'd themselves of the
Principal streets, and prohibited the <hi>Muscovites</hi> to assemble, and bear Arms. This incens'd
them so, as that they all rose, and met together in several places of the City, purposely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the <hi>Polanders</hi> to divide their forces. The <hi>Polanders</hi> thought it not enough to stand only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the defensive, but set the City on fire in three or four several places, thereby obliging the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> to run to the relief of their Wives and Children, and making their advantage of
that calamity, they set upon the <hi>Muscovites</hi> where ever they met them, and made so horrid a
slaughter of them, that it is said, the sword and the fire destroy'd, in those two dayes, above
200000. persons, and all the houses in the City, excepting the Castle, the Churches, and some
few stone-buildings. The Great Duke's Treasury was ransack'd, as also the Churches and
Monasteries, out of which the <hi>Polanders</hi> got, and sent into <hi>Poland,</hi> an incredible quantity of
Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, among which, the <hi>Muscovites</hi> do, to this day, regret the
loss of a certain <hi>Vnicorn</hi>'s horn, enrich'd with <hi>Diamonds.</hi> They say, the Soldiery got such a
booty, that some of them charg'd their Pistols with great round Pearls. Fifteen dayes after
this disorder came <hi>Zachary Listpenow</hi> with a good Army, and besig'd the <hi>Polanders</hi> in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
kill'd many of them in several assaults, and, at last, forc'd them to a composition, and to
depart the Kingdom.</p>

new Great Duke, and chose <hi>Michael Foederouits,</hi> the son of <hi>Foedor Nikitis,</hi> a Kinsman, but far
remov'd, of <hi>Iuan Basilouits.</hi> This man had forsaken his wife, for God's sake, as they call it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Religious man, whereupon he was made <hi>Patriarch,</hi> and, in that dignity, chang'd the
name of <hi>Foedor,</hi> into that of <hi>Philaretes.</hi> The Son, who was of a very good nature, and much
inclin'd to Devotion, hath alwayes express'd a great respect for his Father, taking his advice in
affairs of greatest importance, and giving him the honour of admittance to all publick Audiences
and Ceremonies, at which he alwayes gave him precedence. He died in the year 1633. some
few dayes before our first Embassy.</p>
                     <p>The first thing this new Great Duke did, after his establishment, was, to make a Peace with
his Neighbour Princes, and to abolish the memory of his Predecessors Cruelties, by so mild a
Government, that it is granted, <hi>Muscovy</hi> hath not had, these many ages, a Prince deserving so
great commendations from his Subjects. He died <hi>Iuly</hi> 12. 1645. in the 49<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> year of his age,
and the 33. of his reign. The Great Dutchess, his Wife, died eight dayes after him, and his
son, <hi>Knez Alexei Michalouits</hi> succeeded him.</p>
                     <p>The reign of <hi>Michael Foederouits</hi> was very quiet. But as, in the times of <hi>Boris Gudenou,</hi> and
<hi>Iohn Basilouits Zuski,</hi> there were Counterfeit <hi>Demetrius's,</hi> so, in <hi>Michael</hi>'s time, there star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

look'd upon as a very excellent person among those who have no further acquaintance with
Learning.<note place="margin">His first preferment</note> The excellency of his voice, and his skill in singing Hymns at Church, recommended
him to the Arch-Bishop of the place, who took him into his service, wherein <hi>Ankudina</hi> behaved himself so well, that the Arch-Bishop having a kindness for him, married him to a Grand-Child
of his. This Allyance, which might have been very advantageous to him, prov'd the
first occasion of his ruine: for he presently began, in his Letters, to assume the quality of Son-in-law
to the <hi>Weywode</hi> of <hi>Vologda,</hi> and <hi>Vellicopermia.</hi> Having, after the Arch-bishops death,
squander'd away his Wife's fortune, he came, with his Family, to <hi>Moscou,</hi> where, upon the
recommendation of a friend of the Arch-bishop's, he found an employment in the <hi>Novazetvert,</hi>

and would be glad to let him see his Wife; intreating him to lend him his Wife's Pearls and
Rings, that he might present her in a condition suitable to his employment. The other did it
without any difficulty, nay, without any thing to shew from the other, of his having receiv'd
them, though they were worth above 1000. Crowns. But <hi>Timoska,</hi> instead of pawning the
Jewels to make up his accompts, sold them, made use of the money, and confidently averr'd
that his friend had not lent him any. <hi>Spilki</hi> clapt him up in prison, but, having no evidence to
convict him, he could not hinder his being set at liberty, <hi>Timoska</hi> had some difference with his

this man's Imposture, who stuck not to give out every where, that he was son to <hi>Iohn Basilouits

<hi>Chmielniski,</hi> to desire the Queen to deliver up that man to him: but <hi>Timoska,</hi> who knew that
enquiry would be made for him, was already got away. His man, whose name was <hi>Kostka,</hi> or

<hi>Sueden,</hi> to put those Traitors into the hands of the Gentleman whom we had sent expressly for that
purpose, it happened that at his coming to <hi>Reuel,</hi> with the Orders of the said Great Queen, the
Governour had already suffered one of them to make his escape, so that he could bring along with
him but only the said <hi>Kostka.</hi> We have understood since, that the other hath been taken and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
in the Country of <hi>Holstein,</hi> wherefore we have thought fit to send to your Highness our <hi>Pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,
Basili Spilki,</hi> accompany'd by some of our Subjects, with Letters from our <hi>Czaarick</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
to intreat you, that you will be pleas'd to deliver up unto them, and to send to us those
Traitors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Letters were dated the last of</hi> October, 1652. <hi>after which the Great Duke sent another of the 5 of</hi> Ianuary, 1653. <hi>to the same effect, save that, at the end of the Letter, were added
the lines following.</hi> Since that time, there came to us, in the moneth of <hi>December</hi> last, <hi>Peter
Micklaf,</hi> of <hi>Novogorod,</hi> who hath informed us, how that, in pursuance of your Orders, the
said Traitor had been secured in your Ducal City of <hi>Neustat,</hi> and that upon the Remonstrance made
to you by the said <hi>Micklaf,</hi> you had translated him to <hi>Gottorp,</hi> to be there kept under a good and
sure guard. Wherefore we send back again unto you the said <hi>Micklaf,</hi> with Letters from our <hi>Cza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arick</hi>
Majesty, to entreat you, to deliver up the said Traitor to him and <hi>Basili Spilki,</hi> that he
may have no further opportunity to escape, and raise new troubles in the World. In acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof our <hi>Czaarick</hi> Majesty shall serve your Highness, in such occasions as shall present
themselves. This Robber and Traitor to our <hi>Czaarick</hi> Majesty, named <hi>Timoska,</hi> is of very mean
Birth, the son of a Linnen-Draper that dealt only in coarse cloaths, named <hi>Demki Ankudina,</hi>
of the Suburbs of <hi>Vologda,</hi> His Mother is called <hi>Salmaniska,</hi> and his Son, who is yet living,
<hi>Tereska. Timoska</hi> was an under Officer in the <hi>Nova Zetvert,</hi> and he hath robb'd our Treasury,
hath kill'd his Wife, and, with his own house, hath burnt several other houses that were near his,
whereby many of our Subjects have been ruined. Wherefore knowing that he could not avoid death o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than by flight, he got away in the manner we have mentioned. Given at our <hi>Czaarick</hi>
residence of <hi>Moscou,</hi> the third of <hi>January,</hi> in the year of the Worlds Creation, 7161. and of the
birth of our Saviour, 1653. After this, he also writ a third Letter, of the 17 of <hi>October</hi> the same
year, upon which the Prisoner was delivered up to those, whom the Great Duke had appointed to
receive him.</p>
                     <p>One of these Deputies was the same <hi>Spilki</hi> whom <hi>Timoska</hi> had cheated of his Wife's coller
and Pearls. To be Gossips is a great allyance in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> besides they had been fellow-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in the same Employment, wherefore <hi>Spilki</hi> desired, his Highness would give him leave to
see the Prisoner, and to speak to him in the presence of some Officers of the Court. But <hi>Timos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka</hi>
behaved himself as if he knew him not, and would not speak the <hi>Muscovian,</hi> but the <hi>Polish</hi>
language, purposely to gravel the other, who could not speak it well. <hi>Spilki</hi> asked him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his name were not <hi>Timoska Ankudina,</hi> and whether he had not robb'd the Great Duke's
Treasury, and committed several other enormous crimes? <hi>Timoska</hi> made him answer, that it
might be <hi>Timoska Aukudina</hi> had robb'd the Great Duke's Treasury, or converted his money to
his own use, but that he was not concern'd in it. That his name was <hi>Iohannes Sinensis,</hi> and in
the <hi>Polish</hi> language <hi>Zuiski,</hi> cunningly avoiding to hint at what he had said before, to wit, that
he was Son to the Great Duke, <hi>Iohn Basilouits Zuski.</hi> But when <hi>Spilki</hi> ask'd him, whether
he remembred not his life past; the other derided him, gave him injurious language, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that he could not acknowledge him in the quality of a <hi>Poslanick,</hi> since he was but a poor
Shop-keeper, and seller of Pins, alluding to his name, <hi>Spilki,</hi> which signifies, a Pin-maker.
<hi>Timoska</hi> would needs, one day, intreat his Highness of <hi>Holstein</hi> to appoint his Chancellor, and
some others of his Councel, to receive from his own mouth the state of his affairs. They askt
him what house and family he was of, and whether he were of kin to the Great Duke, why
the Great Duke persecuted him, and wherein he could any way prejudice him? He answer'd,
that it was known; his name was <hi>Iohannes Sinensis,</hi> and in the <hi>Polish</hi> language, <hi>Zuski;</hi> that,
at his Baptism, he had been named <hi>Timotheus;</hi> that he was the Son of <hi>Basili Domitian Suiski;</hi>
and that he had been so surnamed, from a City in <hi>Muscovy</hi> called <hi>Suia:</hi> That he was original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Muscovite,</hi> but born and brought up in <hi>Poland,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Novogarka Severskhio,</hi>
and that he was hereditary Lord of <hi>Hukragina Severska,</hi> upon the Frontiers of <hi>Muscovy:</hi> That
the Great Duke was not his Kinsman, in as much as the Great Duke's Father had been but a
Gentleman, whereas his was a Prince born, and that was the reason why the Great Duke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
him. That the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> who was then ingaged in a War against the King
of <hi>Poland,</hi> would have employ'd him in a War against the Great Duke, but he had a greater
affection for the Country of his Predecessors, than to trouble its quiet: That it was in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to send above a 100000 men into <hi>Muscovy,</hi> but that God, of his goodness, had divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his thoughts from doing any such thing. He had written somewhat to that purpose to the
Patriarch. For the <hi>Poslanick,</hi> who came from <hi>Sueden,</hi> having enter'd into a Familiarity with
him, and advised him to write to the Patriarch, as the most likely person to procure his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47786:59"/>
he resolv'd to do it, and deliver'd his Letter to the <hi>Poslanick,</hi> in which he writ to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
that he was indeed a <hi>Muscovite,</hi> and, at his Baptism, had been named <hi>Timothy,</hi>
whereof the word <hi>Timoska</hi> is the diminutive. That he had had a desire to enter <hi>Muscovy</hi> with
an Army of 300000 men, but that he had been diverted from that pernicious design by the
Guardian Angel of <hi>Muscovy.</hi> That thereupon he came to himself, and was resolved to return
into his Country, whereas, had he been minded to continue his wicked life, it had been easie
for him to get out of the prison at <hi>Neustat,</hi> but that it was his intention to return into <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>
voluntarily, with those whom the Great Duke had appointed to conduct him. The <hi>Posla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi>
who doubted not, but that, upon this Letter, he would have made such a confession,
as night have convinc'd him, open'd, and read it in his presence. But he had to do with a man,
whom so small a matter would not make to betray himself. He would perswade them that the
<hi>Poslanick</hi> was a cheat, and that the Letter was counterfeited, that he had never writ it, and to
make good what he said, he writ another Letter of a Stile and Character so far different from
that of the former, that the <hi>Poslanick,</hi> mad to see himself so abused, flung it in his face. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moska</hi>
took it up, and tore it to pieces.</p>
                     <p>But the distraction of his conscience was but too apparent in the inconsistency of his depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Timoska</hi> varies in his deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>
and the declarations he had made, both by word of mouth and writing. For, one while,
he said, he was Son to the Great Duke, <hi>Basili Iuanouits Zuski;</hi> and another, he said his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
name was <hi>Basile Domitian,</hi> though it was known, that, in that time, there were but
three Lords of the House of <hi>Zuski,</hi> and not any of them was of that name. Sometimes he
would be thought a <hi>Polander,</hi> and would confidently maintain that he could make it as clear as
the Sun at Noon, that he was no <hi>Muscovite,</hi> and that there was not any thing in his person,
language, or manner of life which might perswade the World that he was. Indeed his beard
was quite after another fashion than the <hi>Muscovitet</hi> ordinarily wear theirs. He had the <hi>Latin,
Italian, German</hi> and <hi>Turkish</hi> Languages, so well, as to be understood in any of them, and he
had such an art in counterfeiting all sorts of hands, that it was hard to convince him by that
which he writ in his first employment. Nay he would have had us suspect as counterfeited, the
Letters sent by the Great Duke to our Prince, because he had not signed them, and might have
surpriz'd us with that allegation, had we not learnt in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> that the Great Duke never
signs expeditions, but leaves that to be done by the Secretaries of State.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Timoska</hi> perceiving these evasions would not serve his turn,<note place="margin">Would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his own death.</note>

he cast himself down headlong from the Wagon, and shuffled himself under the Wheels,
hoping they would pass over his Body; but the ground being soft and sandy, his fall did him
no hurt, and the Wagon was immediately staid; so that they had the time to return him to his
place, where they fasten'd him beyond all fear of shewing such another trick. He seem'd to be
in a very good humour all the way, yet sought all the means he could imagine, to compass his
own death; but he was so narrowly watch'd, that at last being out of all hope to effect it, the
joy he had express'd before was much abated. Coming to <hi>Novogorod,</hi> he fell into so deep a
melancholy, that he was become absolutely disconsolate. Which yet hindred not but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
the greatest tortures he express'd an admirable constancy, at least if I may so call the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
obstinacy, in which he persisted, as to his first depositions; whether it were his design
thereby to confirm, in strangers, the opinion he would have imprinted in them, or that he
considered with himself, that his confession would not prevent his death, nor alleviate his
misfortune.<note place="margin">Is tortured</note> As soon as he came to <hi>Moscou,</hi> he was put to the torture, in the presence of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
persons of quality; but he impudently told them, that, of all the <hi>Bojares,</hi> he would not
vouchsafe to speak to any, but <hi>Knez Nikita Iuanouits Romanow;</hi> and him only, as knowing
him by fame, by reason of his goodness and courage he should be glad to have some discourse
withall. While two <hi>Bojares</hi> were gone to find out <hi>Nikita, Timoska</hi> desired somewhat to drink.
They presented to him some <hi>Quas,</hi> in a wooden dish, but he would have <hi>Hydromel,</hi> and that
it should be brought him in a silver Cup; but after they had so far comply'd with his humour,
he only put it to his lips, and would not drink. Seeing <hi>Nikita,</hi> and the other two <hi>Bojares</hi>
come in, he gave them a civil salute: but still affirmed, that he was Son to <hi>Basili Iuanouits
Zuski,</hi> though it were prov'd against him, that he was the Son of <hi>Dementi Aukudina,</hi> a Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
Draper of <hi>Vologda,</hi> and that the Great Duke <hi>Basili</hi> had had no children, but only two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>Knez Demetri Iuanouits,</hi> and <hi>Iuan Iuanouits Zuski,</hi> who both died without issue male.
For of these three Brothers, who were sent Prisoners into <hi>Poland,</hi> at the election of <hi>Vladislaus,</hi>
in the year 1610. with the rest of the Great Dukes kinred, the two elder died there, and the
third was releas'd, and sent back into <hi>Muscovy,</hi> where he died some few years before the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of <hi>Timoska.</hi> 'Tis true, there was another Lord of the same Family, but he had left on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one Son, named <hi>Michael Basilouits Zuski Scapin,</hi>
who died without issue, when the <hi>Suedes</hi>
took the City of <hi>Novogorod,</hi> in the year 1616.</p>
                     <p>While he endured the torture, they brought his Mother to him, who exhorted him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his crime. He seem'd to be moved at her presence, but persisted in affirming he knew
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47786:59"/>
her not, no more than he did <hi>Iuan Pescou,</hi> with whom he had left his Son, when he left <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy.</hi>
This man represented to him how much he was to blame, for behaving himself so in
the condition he was in, and told him, that he must at last pull off the vizard, he had made use
of for so many years, to cheat the World, and disturb his Country, conjuring him to own his
Son, and rely no longer on elusions and impostures, which would only aggravate his misery,
and bring a greater weight of God's vengeance upon him. He was so mov'd hereat, that he
would not speak one word afterwards, though there were divers persons brought before him,
who had known him while he was employ'd at the Tavern-Office. He was search'd and found
to be Circumcis'd. The next day they put him again to the torture, but he would not speak at
all: so that he was immediately carried to the great Market-place, where his sentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,<note place="margin">And Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note>
and presently put in execution. They cut off, with an Ax, first, his right arm, below
the elbow, then the left leg, below the knee, and afterwards the left arm and right leg, and last
of all the head, The members were set up on stakes, and the trunk left upon the ground: but
the Dogs devour'd it in the night, and the next morning the Executioner's Servants dragg'd the
members to the place where all the City dirt is thrown.</p>
                     <p>His man, <hi>Kostka</hi> was pardoned, because he had confess'd the truth; but, in regard he had
been unfaithful towards his Prince, he was sentenc'd to lose three fingers of his right hand. The
Patriarch got that punishment to be moderated, upon this accompt, that the Religion of the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> obliging them to make the sign of the Cross with the right hand, which ought not
to be maimed, he receiv'd his punishment in the left, and was sent into <hi>Siberia,</hi> where provision
was made for his subsistence during life. About this time there came a <hi>Polish</hi> Envoy to <hi>Moscou</hi>
They gave him audience the same day that <hi>Timoska</hi> was put to death, and brought him through
the Market-place just at the execution, that he might be an eye witness of it, and give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
in <hi>Poland,</hi> of the Tragedy of that Impostor, who had been there look'd upon as son to
the Great Duke, <hi>Basili Iuanouits Zuski.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We said before, that the Great Duke <hi>Michael Federouits</hi> died <hi>Iul.</hi> 12. 1645. The very next
day, the <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojares</hi> would needs crown his Son, <hi>Alexei Michaelouits,</hi> who was not full
sixteen years of age. He it is that now reigns, and makes himself known by the War he made
upon <hi>Poland,</hi> as also by that which he daily threatens against <hi>Sueden.</hi> He was born, <hi>March 17.
1630. Knez Boris Iuanouits Morosou,</hi> fearing his enemies might take any advantage of the
Prince's tender years, so hastened his Coronation, that they could not send for all those who
are oblig'd to be present thereat, nor perform it with the requisite Ceremonies: which are as
followeth.</p>
                     <p>They summon to <hi>Moscou,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Cza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar</hi>'s Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</note> not only all the Metropolitans, Archbishops, Bishops, Knez, and
Bojares, but also the Principal Merchants, of all the Cities in the Kingdom. The day appointed
for the Coronation, the Patriarch, attended by the Metropolitans, conduct the new Great Duke
to the Church within the Castle, where a Scaffold is erected three steps high, cover'd with rich
<hi>Persian</hi> Tapistry, on which are set three Brocado Chairs, at an equal distance one from the
other. One is for the Great Duke, another for the Patriarch, and upon the third are set the
Ducal Cap and Robe. The Cap is embroider'd with Pearls and Diamonds, having upon the
Crown a Tassel, on which hangs a little Crown, set as thick as may be with Diamonds: and
the Robe is of a rich Brocado, lined with the best kind of Sables. They say the Great Duke
<hi>Demetri Monomach</hi> found it, at the taking of <hi>Kaffa,</hi> in <hi>Tartarie,</hi> and that he immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
it for the Coronation of the Princes his Successors.</p>
                     <p>As soon as the <hi>Czaar</hi> is come within the Church, the Clergy begin to sing their Hymn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,
which ended, the Patriarch prays to God, to St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and the other Saints, desiring their
presence at that day's Solemnity. The prayer ended, the Chief Counsellour of State, taking
the Great Duke by the hand, presents him to the Patriarch, and sayes to him; Since the <hi>Knez</hi>
and <hi>Bojares</hi> acknowledge the Prince here present to be the next of Kin to the late Great Duke,
and lawfull Heir to the Crown, they desire, that, as such, you immediately Crown him.
Whereupon the Patriarch leads the Prince up to the Scaffold, and having seated him in one of
the three Chairs, he puts to his forehead, a little Cross of Diamonds, and blesses him. Then
one of the Metropolitans reads the following Prayer. <q>O Lord our God, King of Kings,
who didst choose thy servant <hi>David,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> and who didst cause him to be
anointed King over thy people <hi>Israel,</hi> hearken to our prayers, which, though unworthy, we
offer up unto thee. Look down, from the highest Heavens, upon this thy faithful servant,
who is here seated upon this Chair, and whom thou hast exalted to be King over thy people,
whom thou hast redeemed by the blood of thy Son. Anoint him with the Oyl of gladness;
protect him by thy power; set upon his head a precious Diadem; grant him a long and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
life; put into his hand a Royal Scepter, and make him sit upon the Throne of Justice.
Make subject to him all barbarous Languages; Let his heart and his understanding alwayes
continue in thy fear. In all the course of his life, let him be constantly obedient to thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.
Suffer not any Heresie, or Schism to come near his Person or Government. Teach
him to maintain and observe whatsoever the holy <hi>Greek</hi> Church commandeth and ordaineth.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47786:60"/>
                           <hi>Iudge thy people in Iustice, and be merciful to the poor; that, when they leave this Valley of tears,
they may be received into eternal joys.</hi> Which Prayer the Patriarch concludes with these words, <hi>For
thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory; God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy
Ghost be with us, and remain with us.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Prayer ended, the Patriarch commands two Metropolitans to take the Cap and Robe,
and having caused some of the <hi>Bojares</hi> to come upon the Scaffold, he commands them to put
them on the Great Duke, whom he blesseth a second time, by touching his forehead with the
little Cross of Diamonds. Then he causes to be given to them the Ducal Cap, to be set upon his
head, while he says, In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and then
blesses him the third time. That done, the Patriarch causes all the Prelates to approach, who
give the Benediction to the Great Duke, but it is only with their hands. That Ceremony end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Great Duke and the Patriarch sit down, but they immediately rise again, to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for the singing of the Letany, whereof every verse ends with <hi>Gospodi pomiluy,</hi> Lord, have
mercy upon us, putting in ever and anon the great Duke's name. After the Letany they sit
down again, and one of the Metropolitans comes up to the Altar, and says singing, <hi>God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
our</hi> Czaar <hi>and Great Duke of all the</hi> Russes, <hi>whom God hath out of his love bestow'd on us, in
good health, and grant him a long and a happy life.</hi> All that are present, as well Ecclesiasticks as
Laicks repeat the same words, which make the Church echo again with the greatness of their joy.
Then the <hi>Bojares</hi> come up to the Great Duke, smite their foreheads in his presence, and kisse
his hand. That done, the Patriarch comes up alone before the Great Duke, and tells him;
<hi>That, since, through the Providence of God, all the Estates of the Kingdom, as well Ecclesiastical
as Temporal, have establish'd and Crowned him Great Duke over all the</hi> Russes, <hi>and have entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with a Government and Conduct of so great importance, he ought to apply all his thoughts to
love God, keep his Commandments, administer Iustice, and protect, and maintain the true</hi> Greek
<hi>Religion.</hi> That done, the Patriarch gives him the Benediction, and the whole Assembly goes
out of that Church, into that of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, which is opposite to the other,
where they sing over the same Letanies; which is done afterwards in that also of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi>
where they conclude the Ceremonies, and Dine in the Great Hall of the Duke's Palace.</p>
                     <p>After the Coronation,<note place="margin">The Great Dukes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.</note> 
                        <hi>Alexei Michaelouits Morosou</hi> chang'd the quality of Governour
into that of Favourite and Chief Minister, and had the same power in Affairs, as he had over
the Prince's person during his fathers life. He began his establishment with the great Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he bestow'd on the Kinred of the Great Dutchess-Mother, for whom the Prince
had a great Veneration: but under that pretence he kept them at a distance from Court, which,
as also the chiefest places of publick trust, he in the mean time fill'd with his own Kinred and
Creatures, who wholly depended on his fortune. He permitted not any other to come near the
Prince's person, whom he would often get out of the Capital City, under pretence of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or some other divertisement; so to beget in him an aversion to business, that he might
have the management of all things. He thought the only way to make sure of him, would
be to get him a Wife, and to that end, he brought him acquainted with a Gentlemans Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who was an extraordinary Beauty, but of mean extraction. 'Twas his design to marry her
Sister, by that means to interesse the Great Duke more nearly in his preservation. These Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womens
Father, was one <hi>Ilia Danilouits Miloslauski,</hi> very much look'd upon by the Favourite, not
only upon the accompt of his two fair Daughters, but also in regard of his constant attendance
on him. So that upon the confidence he had of his affection and fidelity, he one day took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to speak to the Great Duke of him, and thence, to celebrate so highly the beauty of those
Gentlewomen, that, it rais'd in him a desire to see them. The Great Duke sent for them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of a Visit to the Princesses his Sisters, and having seen them, he was so taken with
the Beauty of the Elder, that he immediately sent one to tell <hi>Miloslauskie,</hi> that he would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him with Alliance, and marry one of his Daughters. The Gentleman receiv'd the message
with much respect, and return'd his humble thanks to the Great Duke for the favour he was
pleas'd to do him. Soon after, they carried rich Presents to the intended Bride, and a good
sum of money to the Father, who, with others of the Kinred, could not, without that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
have appear'd at the Marriage of his Daughter. They were married on <hi>Shrove</hi>-Sunday,
in the year 1647. but without any noise, lest the consequences of that Solemnity might be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by Charms. Eight days after, <hi>Morosou</hi> was married to <hi>Miloslauskie</hi>'s second Daughter,
and so became Brother-in-Law to the Great Duke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ilia Danilouits Miloslauskie</hi> was no sooner advanc'd to this new-greatness, but he would have
all the World to take notice of it. He pull'd down a Wooden house that had been given him in
the Castle near the Great Duke's Palace, and built a Sumptuous one of Stone in it's place. He
cast off, by degrees, the old Officers of the house, and brought in his own Kindred and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
who being no less necessitous than the chief of their family, let slip no opportunity of
advantaging themselves. Among others, he made one <hi>Leponti Steppanouits Plesseou</hi> Chief Judge
of the Citie of <hi>Moscou,</hi> in that Jurisdiction which they call <hi>Semskoi Duor.</hi> No Concussion, no
Extortion, but this man would undertake. He thought it not enough to receive Presents, but
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47786:60"/>
would reduce both parties to the utmost extremities. He suborn'd false Witnesses, whose em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
was to bring in charges against those, who were rich enough to redeem themselves out
of his persecutions, imprisoning, and oppressing them till they purchas'd their Liberties with
the ruine of their Estates; and of these instruments of his Tyranny, one was called <hi>Peter Ticho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuits
Trochaniotou,</hi> his Brother-in-law. This <hi>Peter</hi> was one of those, whom, in <hi>Muscovy,</hi>
they call <hi>Ocolnits,</hi> out of which number are chosen the <hi>Bojares,</hi> and he had the management of
the <hi>Puskarse Pricas,</hi> that is to say, was Overseer of the Armourers, Canoniers, and all the
Mechanicks belonging to the Arsenal, who were very much oppress'd by him. For, instead of
paying them monethly, as they are wont to do in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> where all that are in the Great
Duke's service, are so punctually pay'd, that if they come not the first day of the moneth for
their money, it is sent home to them; he, on the contrary, kept them several moneths with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, forc'd them to compound, and to give acquittances for the whole sum, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
but some part. Besides, Trading was obstructed, Monopolies granted, and no Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could be had, but by dearly purchasing the Favorite <hi>Morosou</hi>'s good pleasure. One got
a Patent, prohibiting the further use of the ordinary <hi>Ells,</hi> purposely to oblige the people to buy
Iron ones with the Great Duke's mark upon them: but instead of selling them at 8. or 10 <hi>d.</hi> a
piece, as they were worth, they could not be had under a Crown; by which means was rais'd
a vast sum of money, by reason of the necessity there was of having them all over the Kingdom.
Another found out the invention of raising the <hi>Poude</hi> (that is 40. pound) of Salt, to thirty
pence, which before cost but twenty. But instead of making advantage of it, they found at the
year's end, that the dearness of the Salt had so hindred the sale of it, that the Great Dukes reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
was not only very much diminish'd, but abundance of fish was lost for want of sufficient
salting; so that had it not been their design rather to oppress the people than to promote the
Great Duke's service, they would soon have put down that new imposition. The Inhabitants
of <hi>Moscou,</hi> who had liv'd very quietly under the late Great Duke's reign could not but discover
their resentment of these pressures. They had their assemblies about the Churches, at the hours
when their Devotions brought them thither, and resolv'd at last to Petition the Great Duke.
And in regard no one person either would or durst undertake the delivery of a Petition to him,
they appointed a day to give it him themselves, as he should come out of the Castle, to go to his
devotions or divertisements. Their main spleen was against <hi>Leponti Steppanouits Plesscou,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that his place might be supply'd by some person of honour, of whom they might expect
more Justice. They had their Petition ready, and sought two or three times an opportunity to
present it to the Prince; but the <hi>Bojares,</hi> who attend him in those Ceremonies, took it from
them, and making only a report of it, as they had been instructed by <hi>Morosou,</hi> the Petition was
not answered, nor the people reliev'd. This happen'd so often, that the people at last resolv'd
to take some other course, and to make their complaints by word of mouth, upon the first op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
that should offer it self. The 6. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1648. they took their advantage of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
which the Great Duke made to a Monastery in the Citie called <hi>Stertenskie.</hi> The people
were got together in the Market-place before the Castle, to see him pass by, as they were wont;
but at his return, they broke through those that attended the Great Duke, came up to him, laid
hold of his bridle, stay'd him, and entreated him to hear the complaints they had to make to
him, concerning the injustices and violences committed by <hi>Plesseou,</hi> desiring there might be put
into his place some person of integrity, who should better supply so important a charge. The
Great Duke though a little startled at their procedure, still kept his countenance, and seem'd not
a little troubled at the grievances of his good Subjects, promised, that he would examine how
the matter stood, and that they should receive satisfaction. The people desir'd no more, and
were going away well satisfy'd with that answer, when some <hi>Bojares,</hi> friends of <hi>Plesscou,</hi> would
needs give the people abusive language, thrust some of their horses, and struck others with their
whips, whereat being incens'd, they so pelted their Lordships with stones, that they were forc'd
to make all speed they could to the Castle, whither the people pursued them so vigorously, that
all the Guard could do was only to stop them till the others were gotten into the Great Duke's
Chamber. This resistance of the <hi>Strelits,</hi> rather inflamed, than abated, the people's fury, who
threatned to force the Prince's Lodgings, and take away all they found there, if <hi>Plesseou</hi> were
not immediately put into their hands. <hi>Morosou</hi> came out into a Balcony, and endeavoured to
appease the people, exhorting them, in the name of his <hi>Czaarick</hi> Majesty, to go all to their
homes, and make no further tumult. But they told him, that they had as much to say to him
as to the other. Accordingly, some went immediately to his Palace, which was forc'd, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack'd,
and demolish'd in a moment, having cast out at a window one of his Servants, who
would have made some opposition. Their animosity was such, as that they spar'd not even the
Images of their Saints, for which they are wont to have a great veneration. Yet did they shew
some respect to <hi>Morosou</hi>'s Wife, and thought it enough to take away her Pearls and Jewels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which they cast into the street, and to frighten her a little, by telling her, that had they not
look'd upon her as Sister-in-law to the Great Duke, they would have cut her to pieces. Among
other things, they broke his rich Coach, which, besides the expence in other things about it,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47786:61"/>
had all silver even about the Wheels. Some got into the Cellar, and knock'd out the heads of
the Strong-water Barrels, which taking fire consumed all those who had made themselves drunk.
This was the Prologue to the ransacking of several other houses afterwards,<note place="margin">An Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in <hi>Moscou.</hi>
                        </note> as those of <hi>Plesseou;</hi>
and <hi>Tichonouits,</hi> the Chancellors, and all that had any relation to, or dependance on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
which afforded them such a booty, as that they sold Pearls by handfuls, and so cheap,
that for thirty Crowns a man might have bought a hat-ful; a black-foxe-skin, or a pair of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
for 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> and stuffs of Gold, Silver, and Silk, in a manner for nothing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nazari Iuanouits Tzistou,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> had farm'd the imposition upon the
Salt, and lay sick in his bed, by reason of an accident that had happened to him three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which was, that, meeting with a mad Ox, his Horsed started and threw him, so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
that he was in some danger of his life. But hearing that <hi>Morosou</hi>'s house had been ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack'd,
and not doubting but they would come to his, he hid himself under a heap of Birch,
which they at a certain time make provision of, to serve the Stoves; and to take off all suspicion,
he caus'd himself to be cover'd with some Flitches of Becon: so that he had certainly saved his
life, had he not been betray'd by one of his Servants, who making his advantage of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
misfortune, took a good sum of Money, and went to <hi>Nisenovogorod.</hi> The enrag'd mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
took him out by the heels, and dragg'd him down stairs into the Court, where they cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell'd
him to death. The body was thrown upon the Dung-hill, and the house so pillag'd, that
there was not any thing left. While these disorders were committed in the City, they had the
time to barricado themselves in the Castle, against the insolences of the people, who continued
all night between the 6 and 7 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in arms, in such a posture, as shew'd they only expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
day-light to begin again. Whereupon, Orders were sent to the <hi>German</hi> Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
to meet at several rendevouzes, in the City, and to come in to the Great Dukes relief
at the Castle. They march'd with Drums beating, and Colours flying, and the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
instead of opposing them, gave them way, and told them, that they had no quarrel against
them, and knew them to be persons of honour who approved not the miscarriages of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Being got into the Castle, they took up the posts of their Guards, and the Great
Duke sent out <hi>Knez Nikita Iuanouits Romanow,</hi> whom he knew the people much respected, to
endeavour the breaking up of the Assembly. He came to the people, cap in hand, and told
them, that he conceiv'd they ought to be satisfy'd with the assurance, which the Great Duke
had made them the day before, that he would remedy the disorders of which they complained.
That his Majesty had commanded him to tell them as much, and to advise them to go every
man to his home, that he might the better perform what he had promised them. This message
was well receiv'd, and the people made answer, that they were not dissatisfied with the Great
Duke, but those who, under his name, abused his authority, and that they would not stir,
till they had deliver'd up to them, <hi>Boris Iuanouits Morosou, Leponti Steppanouits Plesseou,</hi> and
<hi>Peter Tichonouits Trachanistou,</hi> that they might revenge, on their heads, the mischief they had
done the whole Kingdom. <hi>Romanow</hi> gave them thanks for the kind answer they had made to his
proposition, and told them he would acquaint the Great Duke with the zeal and affection which
they express'd towards him; that he doubted not, but Order would be taken for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those three Lords, but that he could safely take his oath, that <hi>Morosou,</hi> and <hi>Trachani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow</hi>
had made their escape, and, for the third he should be immediately put to death. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
<hi>Romanow</hi> was no sooner return'd to the Great Duke, but word was sent to the people,
that <hi>Plesseou</hi> was coming to be sacrific'd, and that the other two should come to the same end,
as soon as they were found, and that they should send for the Executioner to do his Office. He
was soon found, being at the Castle-gate with his servants, whence he came about a quarter of
an hour after, leading <hi>Plesseon</hi> to the Market-place, to cut off his head. But the people spar'd
him the trouble,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Plesseou</hi> put to death.</note> falling upon him with Cudgels, so outrageously, that they dispatch'd him in
a moment. They dragg'd the Body through the dirt, accompanying it with all the curses ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable;
till at last a Monk, whom the deceas'd had order'd to be cudgell'd, cut off his head.
<hi>Morosou</hi> had indeed made his escape; but meeting with Waggoners and some of the people
searching after him, he was so fortunate as to avoid them, and by secret ways to get into the
Castle. And that it might not be thought, the Great Duke had consented to the escape of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
there were some sent after <hi>Trachanistou,</hi> who was taken near the Monastery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Troitza,</hi>
twelve leagues from <hi>Moscou.</hi> He was brought, the 8. to <hi>Semskoy Duor,</hi> that is, the place
where his Master had sate as Judge, which the Great Duke hearing of, he commanded his head
to be cut off. This execution wrought so much upon the people, that being informed how
<hi>Morosou</hi> had been met in the Country, and none knew what was become of him, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
further pressing the Great Duke to give them what he had not, and, about 11. in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
went every man to his home. In the afternoon several houses in the quarters of <hi>Metross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky</hi>
and <hi>Twersky,</hi> were set afire; whither the people, which had not yet clear'd the street, ran,
not so much to quench the fire, as to steal. It made such havock in a short time, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
the whole quarter of <hi>Zuargorod,</hi> reducing to ashes all the houses within the <hi>White-Wall,</hi>
to the River <hi>Neglina,</hi> and getting over the River, into the Great Duke's Taverns, it got into
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47786:61"/>
those of his Strong-waters, and grew so violent, that it was fear'd it would have buried the
Castle in its ashes. No body would endeavour to prevent it, those, who were oblig'd thereto,
being got so drunk, that, lying along in the streets, the vapours of the fire, they had in their
bodies, together with the smoak of that which was then in its way to burn down the whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
choak'd them as they lay. About 11. at night, some strangers looking, with no small a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment,
on the fire in that house where they kept the Strong-water, for the Great Duke's
Provision, perceiv'd at some distance a Monk coming towards them with a great burthen, which
by his blowing they conceiv'd must needs be very heavy. Being come near, he call'd for some,
desiring them they would help him to cast into the fire, the body of the abominable <hi>Plesseou,</hi>
which he dragg'd after him, it being, as he said, the only way to quench it: But the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
refusing to meddle with it, he fell a-swearing and cursing, till some <hi>Muscovites</hi> did him
the good office, and holp him to cast the Carcass into the fire, which immediately began to
abate, and some time after went out ere they left the place.</p>
                     <p>Some dayes after this accident, the Great Duke treated the <hi>Strelits</hi> with Strong-water, and
Hydromel, and his Father-in-law, <hi>Ilia Danilouits Miloslausky,</hi> invited divers Citizens of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Professions to dine with him, and spent several dayes together in entertainments. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
also enjoyn'd the Priests and Monks to endeavour the settlement of unquiet spirits, and to
press unto them the respect and obedience to which their consciences oblige them. All thus
quieted, and the Great Duke, having supply'd the places of the executed, with able and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
persons, he took the opportunity of a Procession, to speak to the people, in the presence
of <hi>Nikita Ieuanouits Romanou,</hi> and told them, that he was extremely troubled, to hear of the
injuries and violences done by <hi>Plesseou</hi> and <hi>Trachanistou,</hi> under his name, but contrary to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
That he had put, into their places, persons of integrity, and such as being acceptable
to the people, would administer Justice equally, and without corruption; and that they might
not fail therein, he would have an eye over them; That he repeal'd the Edict about the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
laid on Salt, and that he would, with the soonest, suppress all Monopolies; That they
should enjoy all their Privileges, which if occasion were, he would augment. Whereupon, the
people having smitten their forehead, and given his Majesty thanks, the Great Duke re-assumed
his discourse and said, That it was true indeed, he had promis'd to deliver up to them the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Boris Iuanouits Morosou,</hi> and acknowledg'd, that he could not absolutely justifie him,
but that he could not also resolve to condemn him; That he hoped, the people would not deny
the first Request he should make to them, which was, that they would pardon <hi>Morosou,</hi> only
for that time, as to what he might have displeas'd them in; That he would be answerable for
him, and durst assure them, that <hi>Morosou</hi> should so behave himself for the future, as that they
should have occasion to speak well of him; That if they would not have him to be any longer of
of his Councel, he would dismiss him; but that he desir'd them to look on that Lord, as one
who had been a Father to their Prince, and one that having married the Great Dutchess's Sister,
must needs be extremely dear to him, and consequently, that it would be very hard for him to
consent to his death. The tears which concluded this discourse of the Great Duke's, discover'd the
affection he had for that Favorite, and so mov'd the people, that they all cry'd out, <hi>God grant
His Highness a long and happy life. God's and the Great Duke's will be done.</hi> The <hi>Czaar</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an extraordinary joy hereat, thanked the people, and highly celebrated the zeal and
affection they express'd for his estate and person. Some few dayes after, <hi>Morosou</hi> appeared in
publick, among those who attended the Great Duke, upon occasion of a Pilgrimage, which he
made to the Monastery of <hi>Troitza.</hi> He went uncover'd, from the Castle to the City gate, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting
the people on both sides with great submissions; and from that time, he laid hold on all
occasions to gratifie, and assist those, who addressed themselves to him, in any business they
had at Court.</p>
                     <p>The story we have related confirms the truth of what we have said elsewhere, that the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
how submissive and slavish soever they may be, will endeavour the recovery of their
freedom, when the Government becomes insupportable to them, and casts them into despair. I
shall here add another later example, which will be the less tedious, in that it hath some depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on the precedent, and relates very much to what we have seen, much about the same time,
in all the other Countries of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Great Duke of <hi>Muscovy</hi> sent in the year 1649. a solemn Embassy to the Queen of
<hi>Sueden,</hi> the chief person whereof was, the <hi>Ocolnitza, Boris Iuanouits Puskin.</hi> He had order,
among other things, to accommodate the difference, which seemed to threaten those two States
with an inevitable War, proceeding hence, that the Subjects of both Crowns, left their own
habitations, and got into the other Kingdom to avoid the payment of their debts. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that for 32 years, that accompt had not been clear'd, and that there were more <hi>Suedes</hi> in
<hi>Muscovy,</hi> than there were <hi>Muscovites</hi> in <hi>Sueden,</hi> it was mentioned in the Treaty made by
<hi>Puskin</hi> at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> that for the first thirty years, there should be a liquidation of all accompts,
and for the two other, the Great Duke should pay to the Queen and Crown of <hi>Sueden</hi> 190000
<hi>Roubles,</hi> that is 390000 Crowns, part in mony, part in Rye, and that the payment should
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47786:62"/>
be made in the Spring of the year 1650. Accordingly, <hi>Iohn de Rodes,</hi> being come at that time
to <hi>Moscou,</hi> in the quality of Commissary for the Queen of <hi>Sueden,</hi> receiv'd, in <hi>Copecs,</hi> and
<hi>Ducats</hi> 300000. Crowns, and order was sent to <hi>Foedor Amilianou,</hi> a Merchant of <hi>Plescou,</hi> to
provide as much Rye as should amount to 90000. Crowns. This interess'd man caus'd all the
Rye, wherever it were, to be seized, and permitted not private persons, to buy so much as a
bushel without his permission, which good leave of his they were forc'd to buy at a dear rate.
The Inhabitants of <hi>Plescou</hi> were so impatient under this oppression, that they not only quarrel'd
at the avarice of the <hi>Suedes,</hi> but charg'd <hi>Puskin</hi> with prevarication in his Employment, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiousness
towards his Prince. They said that <hi>Morosou</hi> held correspondence with Strangers,
and presuming that this negotiation was concluded, contrary to the Great Duke's intention,
they endeavour'd to engage the City of <hi>Novogorod</hi> in their quarrel, and went so far on in their
work, that some of the chiefest Merchants having declared for them, the <hi>Weywode</hi> had much
ado to prevent an insurrection of the whole City. Both these and the others resolv'd that they
would stop the money, when it was to be transported into <hi>Sueden,</hi> and that they would no
longer endure the Treaty of the Rye, because it would in likelyhood starve the Country. With
this intention they sent three Deputies to <hi>Moscou,</hi> to wit, a Merchant, a <hi>Cosaque,</hi> and a
<hi>Strelits,</hi> with Order to know whether this Treaty was made, and put in execution with the
Great Duke's consent. In the mean time, without expecting the return of their Deputies, they
ransack'd <hi>Amilianou</hi>'s house, and tortur'd his Wife, to make her confess, where her husband,
who had made his escape, had laid up his money. The <hi>Weywode</hi> came, in hope to prevent the
disorder, but he was forc'd out of the City, and the neighbouring Nobility invited to come in,
and joyn with them against Monopolies and Patentees. These three venerable Deputies were no
sooner come to <hi>Novogorod,</hi> but the <hi>Weywode</hi> caus'd them to be put into Irons, and in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
sent them to <hi>Moscou,</hi> whether came at the same time the <hi>Weywode</hi> of <hi>Plescou,</hi> and the
Merchant <hi>Amilianou.</hi> Intelligence was brought, that those of <hi>Plescou</hi> had robb'd and abus'd a
<hi>Suedish</hi> Merchant, whereupon the Great Duke sent back the <hi>Weywode,</hi> and with him a <hi>Bojar,</hi>
to endeavour the further prevention of these disorders. Those of <hi>Plescou,</hi> who at first would
not receive them, at length opened their Gates, but it was, to put the <hi>Weywode</hi> in prison, and
to affront the <hi>Bojare,</hi> who had the imprudence, at so unseasonable a time, to treat them with
so much severity, that the people fell upon him with Cudgels, and pursu'd him to a Monastery,
where he was so beaten, that he was given over for a dead man.</p>
                     <p>However, the Great Duke pursu'd the execution of the Treaty made with <hi>Sueden,</hi> and paid
money instead of the Rye, sending along with the <hi>Suedish</hi> Commissary a good Convoy of <hi>Stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lits,</hi>
who were to bring him to the Frontiers of <hi>Sueden.</hi> He gave order at the same time to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Nikitouits Gavensky,</hi> to assemble the Nobility of the neighbouring Provinces, and the foot-Regiments
of Colonel <hi>Kormichel,</hi> and Col. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> which made up above 4000 men, and
to besiege the City of <hi>Plescou.</hi> The Inhabitants, as first, pretended to stand out, but their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and strength soon fail'd them, so that they were forc'd to make an accommodation, at the
cost of the Authors of the Sedition, who were put to death, or sent into <hi>Siberia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These disorders have occasion'd a great change in the Affairs and Government of <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
For, though <hi>Miloslauski</hi> and <hi>Morosou</hi> have much credit, and the Patriarch himself a very great
Authority about the Prince, yet have the other <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojares</hi> a great hand in publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and execute their charges every one according to his Birth and Employment. There are
commonly some 30 <hi>Bojares</hi> about the Court, though in <hi>Zuski</hi>'s time there were numbred 70.
In the year 1654. when the War of <hi>Smolensko</hi> was resolv'd on, there were present at the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations
of that important affair, twenty nine <hi>Bojares,</hi> who names were these.</p>

was called to the Crown. The next, which is now the chiefest, is that of <hi>Duoretskoy,</hi> or, <hi>Great
Master,</hi> who hath the over-sight and direction of all the great Duke's houshold. After him
comes the <hi>Orusnitschei,</hi> who hath the over-sight of the Arms and Horses, which are for the
Great Duke's peculiar service, as also of the Harnesses and other Ornaments, which are used at
Entrances, and publick Ceremonies. These three Officers precede all the other <hi>Bojares, Ocol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nits,

                     <p>All the <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Bojares,</hi>

their personal attendance at <hi>Moscou,</hi> where they are oblig'd to be every day at Court, and to
smite their foreheads in the Great Duke's presence, who looks on this attendance of theirs as an
argument of their fidelity, and an assurance of his Estate being in quiet, which might soon be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd
by the authority, these Great men might assume in the Provinces, were they permitted
to make their aboad there.</p>
                     <p>Their Houses,<note place="margin">Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</note> or Palaces, are great and magnificent, and they make great ostentation, as
well in their expences at their houses, as in cloaths and retinue when they go abroad. When
they ride, they have at the bow of their Saddle, a little Timbrel, a foot Diameter, which they
ever and anon touch with the handle of their Whip, to make their way through the throngs,
which are frequent in the Markets and Streets. The <hi>Knez,</hi> who have no employment at Court,
and have not the means to make any great appearance there, retire into the Countrey, where
their manner of life is not much different from that of Peasants.</p>
                     <p>They make very great accompt of the antient Nobility;<note place="margin">They esteem Nobility.</note> not only of that of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
but also of others; which they very particularly inquire into, but above all, are very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in informing themselves of the extraction of those that are sent Ambassadors in <hi>Muscovy,</hi>
They never match but with those of an equal rank with themselves.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bojares</hi> are not only seen at publick Ceremonies and Audiences, but effectively partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of the management of publick affairs, and the decision of Law-sutes, wherein they assume
the quality of Presidents. The Councels for State-affairs are ordinarily held in the night time,
and the Counsellors meet at one in the morning, and are together till nine or ten.</p>
                     <p>We shall speak of the particular employment of the <hi>Bojares,</hi> when we have first given a short
accompt of the Great Dukes revenue, who, having an Estate of a very vast extent, consisting of
a great number of Provinces, must needs be very rich and very powerfull, as well in respect of
his Demesn, as the advantages accrewing from the Traffick made by his Factors, and the Taxes,
Duties, and Impositions paid by his Subjects. In times of peace, the Impositions are not great,
but in the time of War, the Contributions are so excessive, that when the Great Duke <hi>Michael
Federouits,</hi> was to besiege the Citie of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> in the year 1632. he oblig'd the subject to
pay him the <hi>Pettina,</hi> or fifth part of their Estates; but the present Great Duke, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the present War, contented himself with the tenth. The <hi>Knez, Bojares,</hi> and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
pay no Taxes, but are oblig'd, as are also the Monasteries, to raise and maintain a certain
number of men, horse and foot, proportionably to their Revenue.</p>
                     <p>The Customs bring in so considerable a sum, that, some years, the Custom-house of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Archangel</hi> it self payes in above 600000. Crowns. The <hi>Crucisnouduor,</hi> that is to say,
the Taverns, where the Great Duke allows the selling of Wine, Beer, Hydromel, and Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ae,
pay a vast sum, since he receives from three Taverns of the Citie of <hi>Novogorod</hi> above
12009. Crowns, and that, since this duty came to belong to the Sovereign, they are above a
thousand houses, where the Great Duke alone hath all the advantage made by the sale of Wine
and Aquavirae.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sables</hi> also, and other Furs bring in much, because he reserves the Traffick thereof wholly to
himself, as also that of <hi>Cavayar,</hi> and several other Commodities. The Revenue of the money
which he lets out to his Factors is not so certain, as well in regard the Merchants profit is not
alwayes the same, as for that the Factors sometimes break. At our being there he had put 4000
Crowns in the hands of a Merchant named <hi>Savelli,</hi> who instead of improving it to his advantage,
squander'd it away in less than three years, that he lived in <hi>Persia.</hi> The Great Duke, ordered
the <hi>Poslanick, Alexei Sawinouits Romanitsikou,</hi> who went into <hi>Persia</hi> along with us, to take
him, and bring him back into <hi>Muscovy.</hi> Coming to <hi>Scamachy,</hi> we had notice of his being in
the City; but the <hi>Poslanick</hi>'s Interpreter dying, he dissembled his having any order to take him,
and desir'd him to be his Interpreter, in that Negotiation, with a design, under that pretence,
to bring him to the Frontiers, and so to carry him away. The other, who stood upon his
Guard, serv'd him indeed during the <hi>Poslanick</hi>'s aboad at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> but, when he saw him ready
for his departure into <hi>Muscovy,</hi> he got into the <hi>Allacapi</hi> or Sanctuary, was Circumcised, put
himself under the protection of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and continued in <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Great Duke farms out all his Demesn,<note place="margin">His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> but the revenue arising thence, goes, for the
most part, towards the subsistence of the <hi>Strelits,</hi> whereof he is obliged constantly to maintain
a very great number, as well in the City of <hi>Moscou,</hi> where there are above 16000. of them, as
upon the Frontiers; insomuch that the ordinary Militia makes above 100000. men. In a word,
if his receipts are great, his expences are proportionable thereto. There hardly passes a year,
but he is forc'd to purchase a Peace with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> with great sums of Money and Presents.
He does not carry on his Wars at so easie a rate as they do elsewhere. For, taking into his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47786:63"/>
service, a great number of <hi>Germans</hi> and other Foreiners, as well Officers as Souldiers, he is
forc'd to pay them extraordinarily, and some times before hand. The Embassies he receives
stand him in no less than those he sends, for he defrays all publick persons, and makes them
very considerable Presents. The expence of his Table, and the rest of his Court must
needs be very great, there being above a thousand Persons who have meat provided for
them.</p>
                     <p>At Dinner and Supper, there is no sounding of Trumpets, as there is elsewhere, but one
of the Officers goes to the Kitchin and Sellar-doors, and cries <hi>Godusar Kuschinung,</hi> that is,
The Grand Seigneur would be served, and immediately the meat is carried up. The Great
Duke sits at the midst of the Table, alone; if he invites the Patriarch or any other great Lord
to Dine with him, there is another Table set at the end of his, and they are serv'd with some
of the meat which had been presented to the Great Duke, I say, presented, for as much as all
making up but one Course of about fifty Dishes of meat, the Gentlemen set them not down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Table, but hold them in their hands, till the Carver hath shewed them to the Prince,
and he made choice of what he is desirous to eat. If none Dine with him, he sends the Dishes he
hath not medled with, to some Lords in the City, or to his Physicians. The present Great
Duke hath but one, who is the same that went along with us into <hi>Persia.</hi> He is no superstitious
<hi>Galenist,</hi> but, with very good success makes use of Chymical remedies: he is grown so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
that not only the Prince, but the <hi>Bojares</hi> and other great Lords about the Court employ
him. His salary is 124 Crowns, a Month, besides a Pension of six hundred Crowns, <hi>per an.</hi>
and he hath more Wheat, Barly, Honey, and several other Provisions than he can spend in his
Family. The Great Duke is never purg'd, nor bled, but the Physician hath a present of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Crowns, and a piece of Satin or Velvet, or a Zimmer of Sables, which is worth no less.
The <hi>Bojares</hi> do not give their Physicians money, but a certain number of Flitches or Gammons
of Bacon, Sables, Strong-water, and other Provisions. They are obliged to go every day to
Court, and to smite their foreheads in the Great Dukes presence, or at least, before those
who are entrusted with the care of his Cabinet of Druggs, and other Apothecary's
stuff.</p>
                     <p>There are many Interpreters for other Languages, especially for the <hi>German,</hi> the <hi>Polish,</hi> the
<hi>Suedish,</hi> the <hi>Turkish,</hi> and the <hi>Persian.</hi> He whom the Great Duke does chiefly make use of in
his most important affairs is a <hi>Dane,</hi> and is so generally vers'd in all the <hi>Europaean</hi> Languages,
that coming three years since to the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> with <hi>Iuan Iuanouits Boklakouskoi,</hi> and
<hi>Iuan Polycarpousin Michailou,</hi> the Emperor lik'd him so well, that, out of his own inclination,
he made him a Nobleman. The Great Duke's Court hath this common with those of other
Princes, that Vice takes place of Vertue, and gets nearer the Throne. Those who have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be nearest his person, are withall more subtile, more deceitful, and more insolent than
the others that have not. They know very well how to make their advantages of the Princes
favour, and look for the greaest respects and humblest submissions imaginable, from those
who make their addresses to them; which the others render them, as much to avoid the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
they might do them, as for the good they expect from them.</p>
                     <p>The Great Duke's Council is divided into six Classes, or, as they call them, Courts of
Chancery. The first is for strangers Affairs; the second for War; the third, for Crown-Lands
and the Prince's Revenue; The fourth receives the Accompts of Factors, and those who
manage the Taverns. The fifth takes Cognizance of Appeals in Civil Causes; and the sixth, of
those, of Criminal Causes.</p>
                     <p>We said before, that the <hi>Bojares</hi> are not only employ'd in State-affairs, but also in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
of private differences, at which they preside, alone, or with other Judges, according
to the nature of those affairs that present themselves.</p>
                     <p>They call <hi>Pololskie Pricas,</hi> the place, where they regulate the affairs of Ambassadors, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the Posts of the Kingdom, and what concerns such Merchants as are strangers. <hi>Almas Iua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouits</hi>
is Secretary of the Court.</p>
                     <p>In the second Court, or Chamber, which they call <hi>Roseradni Pricas,</hi> there is a Register
kept of the quality and families of the <hi>Bojares</hi> and all the Gentlemen of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> as also of
all exploits of War, and the advantages or losses which the Great Duke receives thereby. <hi>Iuan
Ossonassinouits</hi> hath the Presidency of it.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Pomiestnoi Pricas,</hi> which is the third Chamber, there is a Register kept of all the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
held by homage, and the sutes concerning the same are judged. There are also received the
duties belonging to the Great Duke, from the said Mannors; under the direction of <hi>Foedor
Cusmits Iellisariou.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Casanskoy,</hi> and <hi>Siberskoy Pricas,</hi> that is to say, the fourth and fifth Chamber, the

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Inasemski Pricas,</hi> is for such Military Officers as are strangers, whose Causes are there

the Great Duke's Father-in-law, who is the President thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Reitarskoi Pricas,</hi> judges the Causes of the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Cavalry, and there, in time of

                     <p>The Patriarch hath his particular <hi>Pricas</hi>'s; to wit; that of <hi>Roscrad,</hi> where a Register is kept
of all the Church-goods, and where are the Charters and Archives; that of <hi>Sudny,</hi> where the
Patriarch hath his Spiritual Jurisdiction; and that of <hi>Casaunoy,</hi> where the Patriarch's Revenue
and Treasure is kept. He hath also his Ecclesiastical Judges and Officers, who give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all their actions.</p>
                     <p>There is no <hi>Pricas,</hi> but hath its <hi>Diak,</hi> or Secretary, and many Clerks and Coppiers, who
all write very well, and are skill'd in Arithmetick, according to their way, in which they make
use of Plum-stones instead of Counters. Whence it comes, that there is no Officer but hath
about him a certain quantity of them in a little purse. They are forbidden, upon pain of whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
to take <hi>Poschnl,</hi> or Presents; yet they venture to do it; nay their avarice is such, that
many times, they will, of themselves, proffer Copies of dispatches, and private resolutions,
out of a hope to get somewhat for them. But these proffers are to be mistrusted, for I know by
experience, that those people seldom have what they put others in hope of; or if they have,
it is so dangerous to communicate it, that for the most part they put off forgeries and suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pieces. In the year 1643. the Minister of a Forein Prince being desirous to have a Copy of
my Dispatches, one of the Clerks of the Counsel sold it him at a very dear rate. I was shewn it
afterwards; but when at my return to <hi>Holstein,</hi> the Letters were translated, there was nothing
of what I had seen in the Copy.</p>
                     <p>They do not keep a Register of their Acts in Books, but they write them in Rolls of paper
pasted together, till they are 25. or 30. ells in length; of which their Offices are full.</p>
                     <p>At our coming to <hi>Moscou,</hi> we were made believe, that Presents could procure any thing at
Court. Indeed I have known some Lords, who though they would not take ought themselves,
were not sorry to see any thing sent to their Wives: but I have also known some, who made it
appear, they were absolutely incorruptible, and that their fidelity to their Prince was Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
to their great regret, who consider, that where nothing is given, nothing is thence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>

                        </gap> the year 1647. the Great Duke assembled together the
most Famous Men of the Kingdom, and caused to be set down in writing, and to be publish'd,
several Laws and Ordinances, whereby the Judges are to regulate themselves. They were
printed, <hi>in folio,</hi> under the Title of SOBORNA ULOSIENIA, that is to say, <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
and General Right,</hi> for the direction of the <hi>Bojares.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heretofore their proceedings were thus. In those Causes, where the parties were not agreed
as to the matter of fact, and had no evidence of either side, the Judge asked the Defendant, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47786:65"/>
he would take his Oath, that the matter was as he alleged, or refer it to the Plaintiff's Oath.
He who proffer'd to take his Oath, was, once a week, for three weeks one after another,
brought before the Judge, who every time, press'd unto him the importance of an Oath, and
the sin he would burthen his Conscience withall, if he swore falsly. If, notwithstanding these
remonstrances, he still persisted in his readiness to take his Oath, though he swore nothing but
the truth, yet people look'd on him as an infamous person, would spit in his face, and turn him
out of the Church, into which he was never receiv'd afterwards, much less was he admitted to
the Communion, unless it were at the point of death. Now, they do not proceed with so much
rigour, but only bring him who is to take his Oath before an Image of one of their Saints,
where he is asked, whether he will take his Oath upon the salvation of his Soul? If he persist,
they give him a little Crucifix to kiss, and afterwards the Saint's Image, which for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
is taken down from the Wall. If the Oath be good, the party who took it is not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Communion for three years, and though he be not treated as an infamous person,
yet those of any quality will not easily suffer him in their Company: but a perjur'd person, is
severely punished; first cruelly whipt, then banish'd. Whence it comes, that the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
endeavour all they can to avoid it, though upon any trivial occasion, especially in their dealings,
they stick not to swear at every word, and have incessantly in their mouths their <hi>Po Chrestum,</hi>
by Christ, making the sign of the Cross at the same time: but there is little credit to be given
those kinds of Oaths, as proceeding from deceit and passion. They permit strangers to take
their Oaths, according to the rules of their several Religions.</p>
                     <p>No invention but they make use of to force people to confess the truth by Torture. One of
the most cruel, in my opinion, is the <hi>Strapado,</hi> which is often given in this manner. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor,
having his hands ty'd behind him, is wound up into the air, and so hangs, having
fasten'd to his feet, a great beam, upon which the Executioner ever and anon gets up, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the pain, and further the dislocation of the Members, while the smoak and fire which are
made under his feet, burns and stifles him. Sometimes they cause the Malefactor's head to be
shaven, and, as he is so hanging, they pour cold water, drop by drop, upon the crown; which
is such a torment as no other comes near, not even that of whipping, (which they many times
give those in that condition) though they at the same time clap a red-hot Iron upon the stripes.</p>
                     <p>In ordinary quarrels, he who gives the first blow gets the worst. Murther, committed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any necessity of defence, is punish'd with death. The guilty person is kept six weeks in a
very close Prison, and fed only with bread and water; after which he receives the Communion,
and hath his head cut off.</p>
                     <p>Thieves are Tortur'd, that they may discover their Complices, and confess their other Crimes.
If it be the first offence, they are whipt from the Castle-Gate to the great Market place, where
the offender hath an Ear cut off, and is put into prison for two years. If he offends the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, he is punish'd in the same manner, and is kept in prison, till he hath company, to be
banish'd into <hi>Siberia.</hi> Theft is never punish'd with death in <hi>Muscovy;</hi> but the concealers and
receivers fare no better, which is the best course could be taken to bridle the lewd inclinations of
that people.</p>
                     <p>The ordinary punishments,<note place="margin">Their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</note> are slitting the nostrils, Whipping, and the <hi>Baltoki.</hi> The last is
not alwayes infamous and publick; yet is there not any Master of a Family, but gives it his
Children and Servants. He who is to receive this Chastisement, puts off his <hi>Kaftan,</hi> and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only his shirt on, layes himself down upon the ground, on his belly, and then two men
set themselves cross upon him, one upon his Neck, the other upon his Feet, having each of
them a little Wand or Switch in his hand, wherewith they beat him upon the Back, much after
the manner that Fell-mongers beat their Furs, to get out the Worms. They ordinarily have
their Nostrils slit who have taken Tobacco, in snuff, contrary to the Great Duke's prohibition.</p>
                     <p>Whipping as it is given in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> is one of the most barbarous punishments that ever
were heard of. <hi>Sept.</hi> 24. 1634. I saw eight men and one woman Whipt, for selling of Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae
and Tobacco. The Executioner's man took them up one after another upon his back, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stript down to the waste, and having their feet ty'd together with a Cord, which passing
between his Legs that held them up, was held by another servant of the Executioner's, so fast,
that they were not able to stir. The Executioner stood three paces off, with a Bull's Pizzel,
having fasten'd to the end of it, three straps or thongs of an Elk's skin, not tann'd, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
as sharp as a Rasour, with which he lay'd on their backs with all his strength, so as
that the blood gush'd out at every lash. The men had each of them 25. or 26. till the Clerk,
who had in a Note what number of lashes they were to receive, cry'd <hi>Polno,</hi> that is to say,
enough. The Woman had but 16. yet did she fall into a swound. Being thus disciplin'd, so as
that their backs were in a manner slic'd and slash'd all over, yet were they all tyed by the Arms,
two and two together, those who had sold Tobacco having a little horn full of it, and those
who had sold Aquavitae, a little bottle about their Necks, and whipt through the Citie, and
after they had walk'd them above half a league about, they were brought back to the place of
their first execution, and dismiss'd. This is so cruel a punishment, that some die of it, as we
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47786:65"/>
said before of the son of General <hi>Herman Schein.</hi> Some after they are thus punish'd wrap them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up in the skin of a sheep newly kill'd.</p>
                     <p>Heretofore these punishments were not infamous, and those who had pass'd through the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner's
hands, were admitted into the best Companies, as was also the Executioner himself,
whose Profession was accounted so honorable, that sometimes even Merchants quitted theirs, to
serve the Magistrate at Executions, and would buy the employment, and after certain years sell
it again to others. The advantages of it ly in this, that the Executioner is not only paid by the
Judge, but gets money also out of the Criminal, to be more gently treated, though indeed, the
greatest profit he makes comes from the Aquavitae, which he sells underhand to the Prisoners.
But now this employment is not much courted, since the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have begun to learn some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of civility from their Neighbours. Nor is the Executioner permitted to sell his Office, but
it must continue in his family, which failing, the Butchers are oblig'd to recommend to the
place one of their body.</p>
                     <p>All we said of the cruelty of their punishments is yet below what they inflict on such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pay their debts. He who pays not at his time, mentioned in the Bond, is put into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants
house, having a certain further time to make satisfaction. If he fail, he is carried to
prison, whence he is every day brought out, to the place before the Chancery, where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Executioner beats him upon the shin-bone with a Wand about the bigness of a man's little
finger, for a whole hour together. That done, he is return'd to prison, unless he can put in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to be forth-coming the next day at the same hour, to be treated in the same manner, till
he hath made satisfaction. And this is executed with much rigour upon all sors of persons, what
condition or quality soever they be of, Subjects, or Foreiners, Men, or Women, Priests, or
lay persons. 'Tis true, some present being made to the Executioner, he suffers the Debtor to
put a thin Iron-plate within his boot, to receive the blows; or it may be he smites more gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
If the Debtor have not to satisfie, he must be sold, with his Wife and Children, to
the Creditor.</p>
                     <p>As to the Religion of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi>
                        </note> before we enter into the discourse of it, we shall say,
that there have been <hi>Lutherane</hi> Doctours in <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Livonia,</hi> who have made it a problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
question, <hi>whether the</hi> Muscovites <hi>were Christians or not?</hi> They might as well have made it
disputable in their Acts, whether the <hi>Muscovites</hi> are men; since there is not so great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between their Religion and that of other Christians, as there is between their Morality
and manner of life, and that of many other men: but as laughter and speech makes them men,
so Baptism and their external profession of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, denominates them Christians.
If a man would take their word for it, they are the only true Christians in the World, since they
only have been baptized, whereas others have been only sprinkled; which is the reason, they
receive no Proselyte, till he be re-baptized. They ground their Religion on the Books of the
Old and New Testament, and they use Sacraments. Their Translation of the Bible is that, which
they call of the seventy Interpreters, which some few years since they have got Translated and
Printed in their own Language. They permit not that a man should bring the whole Bible to
Church, for fear of profaning it by several, not over-modest, passages they find in the Old
Testament: whence it comes they bring only the New, and some Verses taken out of the
Psalms and Prophets; but in their houses they are permitted to read the whole Bible. In the
explication of the Bible, they give much authority to St. <hi>Cyril</hi> Bp. of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whom they
call <hi>Quirila Ierusalimski,</hi> and who writ a Catechism, under the Emperour <hi>Theodosius.</hi> He
flourish'd about the end of the fourth age, and is not to be confounded with <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
whose memory the <hi>Greeks</hi> celebrate on the 9. of <hi>Iune,</hi> whereas they celebrate the Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of the other upon the 18 of <hi>March,</hi> as may be seen in their Menologies. The other Fathers,

Deacon of the Church of <hi>Edessa,</hi> in <hi>Syria.</hi> They relate of him, as also does <hi>Gerard Vossius,</hi> who
hath Translated him into <hi>Latin,</hi> that an Angel having presented to him a Book writ in Golden
Characters, which no body could open, he immediately deriv'd those illuminations from it,
which are at this day apparent in the books he hath publish'd. Besides him, they have also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particular Doctor, named <hi>Nicholas Sudatworits,</hi> who hath writ certain spiritual Treatises.
The <hi>Muscovites</hi> have so great a Veneration for this man's memory, that it is not long since,
that Wax-Candles were lighted before his Picture, for which they had built a particular
Chapel, in the great street which leads to <hi>Twere</hi> Gate: but both were destroy'd by the
late fire.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> Creed is their rule of Faith. They believe in <hi>God the Father,</hi> as Creator of
all the World, in <hi>God the Son,</hi> as Saviour and Redeemer of all Mankind; and in <hi>the Holy
Ghost,</hi> as Sanctifier of all the Faithful.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, their Religion is full of abundance of cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of their Salvation. There is no <hi>Muscovite</hi> but gives his Saints and their Images, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due only to God, who is so jealous thereof, that he treats that false Worship as spiritual
Whoredom. The ignorance of the meaner sort of people is so gross, that they place all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in the honours and veneration they give their Images. It is also all the instructions they
give their Children, who in order to devotion, learn only to stand with great respect before
those Images to say their Prayers. Their good works, (which they believe meritorious) are,
building of Monasteries and Churches, and giving Alms; besides which they do nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a man might judge of their Faith by their works.</p>
                     <p>They stand very much upon their being Members of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and their Histories
and Annals say, that Christian Religion was planted in <hi>Russia</hi> in the Apostles times. That St.
<hi>Andrew</hi> leaving <hi>Greece,</hi> embark'd upon the River <hi>Boristhenes,</hi> and came, by the Sea of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doga,</hi>
to <hi>Novogorod,</hi> where he preach'd the Gospel. That, since that time, <hi>Christian</hi> Religion
had been absolutely destroy'd, by the <hi>Tartars</hi> and other Pagans, who became Masters of all
<hi>Muscovy;</hi> and that about the year 989. <hi>Wolodimer,</hi> Great Duke of <hi>Russia,</hi> having gain'd
very great victories over his Neighbours, and re-united several Provinces to his Crown, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
so considerable, that <hi>Basilius,</hi> and <hi>Constantinus Porphyrogennetes,</hi> Emperours of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
sent a solemn Embassy to congratulate and complement him. That brought him
first acquainted with the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, which he afterwards embraced, and was baptized.
The Bishops and Priests sent thither by the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> further instructed and
baptized the people, who have ever since made profession of the <hi>Greek</hi> Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iohannes Curopalates,</hi> who writ part of the <hi>Byzantine</hi> History, and liv'd about that time,
says, that this Conversion was not effected without miracle, and that the Bishops faith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
more upon the spirits of these <hi>Barbarians,</hi> than the preaching of the Gospel. For being
not able to comprehend the wonderful things which are said of our Saviours life, they desired
a proof of that promise he makes to the faithful, of giving them by the Father what ever they
should desire in his name. The Bishop undertook it, and told them, that he had so great an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of the Word of God, that they could not desire any thing, which his prayer should
not obtain from God. Whereupon they said, that since God had preserv'd <hi>Daniel</hi>'s compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the fiery Furnace, he might as well prevent the Bible, which is full of all those marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
things, from being consumed by fire. The Bishop was content to stand to this tryal, and
so cast the Bible into a great fire, where having lyen till the fire was all spent, the Book was
taken out as untouch'd as when it was cast in. <hi>Cedrenus</hi> and <hi>Zonaras</hi> confirm the truth of this
story, and say that <hi>Wolodimir</hi> was so moved at this miracle, that he immediately abolish'd all
Idolatry, and banish'd it his Territories.</p>
                     <p>Hence it comes that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> love the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and have a kindness for them, and do
them all the good they can, when any occasion offers it self. In the year 1649. The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> came to <hi>Moscou,</hi> and brought the Great Duke some of the earth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Sepulchre, though it is known 'twas cut out of a Rock, and some holy-water from
<hi>Iordan.</hi> He was most magnificently receiv'd, and conducted by the whole Clergy to his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which the Great Duke gave him, together with a Present of above 100000 Ducats: but
he was so unfortunate in his return, as to fall into the hands of some <hi>Turks,</hi> who took away
all had been given him. There come almost every year to the <hi>Czaar</hi>'s Court, some of
the <hi>Greek</hi> Priests or Monks, to sell their Reliques, which they put off at very good
rates.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muscovites</hi> do all profess the same Religion, which being as it were particular to them,
may be said to extend as far as the Great Duke's Dominions do; unless it be, that it is also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
at <hi>Narva,</hi> under the Jurisdiction of the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and that the <hi>Tartars</hi> have also
their <hi>Mahumetan</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion, along the <hi>Wolga,</hi> and beyond <hi>Astrachan,</hi> upon the
<hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. There are not any, not even among their Monks and Priests, that can give any
reason of their belief; because they have not the Word of God preached unto them; upon
which accompt it is, that the Patriarch suffers them not to dispute of Religion, or inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that of foreiners. Some few years since, a Monk of <hi>Nisenovogorod</hi> had some conference
with a <hi>Protestant</hi> Minister; but the Patriarch coming to hear of it, sent for him, and cast him
into prison, where he must have endur'd a great deal of misery, had he not had the wit to say,
that the Minister had discover'd some inclinations to the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Religion, and would, in all
likelyhood, be converted.</p>
                     <p>Their Characters they have from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as well as their Religion; but as they have
altered the later, so also have they changed and augmented the former, as may be seen by the
Table we shall here give of them.</p>

                     <p>These Characters they make use of as well in their printed Books, as Writings, their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
being peculiar to themselves, but coming so near the <hi>Sclavonian,</hi> and the <hi>Polish,</hi> that he
who hath one will find it no great difficulty to learn the other. It hath nothing common with
the <hi>Greek,</hi> though indeed in their Liturgy there are some words, borrow'd from the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
but they are not used any where else. We said before, that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> in their Schools
learn only to read and write in their own Language, and care not for the Learning of any other:
but within these few years, they have, with the Patriarch's consent, opened a School, where
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> is taught, under the direction of a natural <hi>Grecian,</hi> named <hi>Arsenius.</hi> It is
not yet known, what may be expected from it, but certain it is that there are among the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> those that want neither ingenuity nor an inclination to Study, and would learn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, did they but meet with any body to teach them. <hi>Almas Iuanouits,</hi> the present Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
or Chief Secretary of State, was so happy in his youth, as to have travell'd into <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi>
and <hi>Persia,</hi> and learn'd the Languages of those two Countries so well, that he needs no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,
when he hath ought to do with the <hi>Grand Seigneur,</hi> or King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s Miinisters.
The <hi>Danish</hi> Interpreter we spoke of before, hath translated into their Language, certain <hi>Latin</hi>
and <hi>French</hi> Books, which have taken so well, that it is hoped, the Courtiers will, in time,
apply themselves to the study of those Languages, which can acquaint them with such excellent
things.</p>
                     <p>All their exercise of Religion consists principally, in Baptism, Reading of the Word of God
in the Church, going to Mass, praying to Saints, making reverences and inclinations before
their Images, Processions, Pilgrimages, Fasting certain dayes in the year, Confession and
Communion.</p>
                     <p>They think Baptism so much the more necessary,<note place="margin">Their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</note> in that they think it the only door through
which a man must enter into Christ, and so into Paradise. They acknowledge themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and born in sin, and that God hath instituted Baptism for their Regeneration, and to
cleanse them, by water, from their original impurity. Whence it is that they baptize their
Children as soon as they are born. If the child be weak, he is immediately baptized, yet not
in the same room where the Woman lyes in: but if well, he is carried to Church by the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
and Godmother. The Priest receives him at the Church door, signs him with the sign of
the Cross in the forehead, and gives him the Benediction, saying, <hi>The Lord preserve thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in and thy going out.</hi> The Godfathers deliver the Priest nine Wax-candles, which he lights
and fastens cross the Font, which stands in the midst of the Church. He incenses the Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47786:67"/>
and consecrates the water with many ceremonies. Then he makes a Procession together
with the Godfathers, who have wax-candles in their hands, about the Font. The Clark goes
before carrying the Image of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and they go about it three times, the Priest in the interim
reading out of a Book, That done, the Priest askes the Godfathers, the name of the Child,
who give it him in writing. He puts the paper upon an Image, which he holds upon the Child's
breast, and having muttered over certain prayers, he askes the God-father, whether the Child
believes in God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost? Then they all turn their backs to the Font,
to shew their aversion and horrour for the three questions which the Priest is to make them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards;
to wit, whether the Child forsakes the Devil, whether he forsakes his Angels, and
whether he forsakes his Works? The Godfathers answer to every question, yes, and spet so
many times upon the ground. That done, they face about to the Font, and then the Priest, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
asked them whether they promise to bring up the Child in the true <hi>Greek</hi> Religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcises
him, by putting his hands upon the Child, saying, <hi>Get out of this Child thou unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and make way for the holy Ghost,</hi> and by blowing three times cross, upon the Child, to
drive away the Devil, by whom they believe Children are really possessed before Baptism. I
I have been told, that now, the exorcism is performed at the Church-door, lest the Deuil, when
he comes out of the Child, should profane the Church. Then, he cuts off a little of the Child's
hair, and puts it into a Book, and having asked the Godfathers, whether they bring that Child
to be baptised, he takes him, being stark naked, into his arms, and dips him three times into
the water, pronouncing the ordinary words of the Sacrament, <hi>I baptise thee in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost.</hi> After the Baptism, he puts a corn of Salt in the
Child's mouth, makes the sign of the Cross, in the fore-head, upon the hands, the breast, and
the back, with an Oil purposely consecrated for that use, and, putting a clean Shirt about him,
sayes, <hi>Thou art as clean and as clear from thy Original Sin as this Shirt.</hi> The Ceremonies are
concluded with a little Cross of Gold, Silver, or Lead, according to the ability of the Parents,
such as our Bishops wear, which the Priest hangs about the Child's neck, with so strict an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to wear it all his life time, that if it be not found about him at his death, they would
not bury the Carkass, but drag it to the common Dung-hill. The Priest does also assign the
Child a particular Saint, whose Image he delivers to the Godfathers, and charges them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Child, when he is come to years of discretion, to have a particular devotion for his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone.
Then he embraces, and kisses the Child, and the Godfathers, and exhorts them to love
one another, but above all things that they take heed of inter-marrying. If it happens there are
many Children to be Christned at the same time, the Font is emptied so often as there are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to be baptised, and other water is consecrated; it being their perswasion, that the former
being soil'd with the impurity of that Child's Original Sin who had been baptised before, is not
fit to cleanse a second, much less a third. They will not by any means heat this water by fire
but, when it is very cold, put it into a hot place to make it a little warmer. Persons of age
that are to be baptised, such as Apostate <hi>Christians, Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> receive their Baptism in a
Brook or River, where they are plunged over head and ears, be it as cold as it will, nay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they break the Ice to get them into the water. Thus, above all others, are treated those
whom they call <hi>Chaldeens,</hi> or <hi>Chaldaeans.</hi> These are a sort of rascally fellows, who get leave
of the Patriarch to disguise themselves, by putting on Vizards, and to run up and down the
streets from the 18. of <hi>December,</hi> till <hi>Twelve</hi>-tide, with Fireworks, wherewith they set fire in
their hair and beards whom they meet. Their main spleen is against the Peasants, whom they
force, every time they are met, to pay a <hi>Copec</hi> ere they get out of their hands: and this they
exact with such insolence, that I have seen them set a load of Hay on fire, and burn the Peasant's
beard and face, because he made some difficulty to give it them. They are all disguis'd, and
have on their heads great wooden hats, fantastically painted, daubing their beards with honey,
that the sparkles might not fasten in them. These artificial fires they make of a powder which
they call <hi>Plaua,</hi> made of a certain herb not known elsewhere. It makes a noble and very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
flame, especially in the night. But of these hereafter, when we come to treat of the
<hi>Persian</hi> Fire-works. These men, as they say, represent those who heated the Oven, into which
<hi>Shadrach, Mesak,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> were cast, by the command of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These people are treated as profane persons, and are numbred among Pagans and Infidels; so
that being in a state of inevitable damnation, they must necessarily be reconciled to God, and
enter into the Church by Baptisme. To that end they pitch on <hi>Twelf</hi>-day, as that on which
sometimes happened the vocation of the Gentiles, and afterwards, they are as clean, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as holy as the best <hi>Christians,</hi> who are ordinarily baptized but once, whereas one of these
<hi>Chaldaeans</hi> may have been baptised ten or twelve times. The insolences committed by them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
the prohibitions made by the late Pattriarch, that any should put on Vizards or disguise
themselves.</p>
                     <p>Those who are to profess the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Religion are oblig'd to go, for six weeks, into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
where the Monks instruct them, and teach them their Prayers, the manner of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Saints, of doing reverence to the Images, and making the signs of the Cross. Then
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47786:67"/>
they are brought to the place where they are to be baptised, where they are obliged to abjure
their former Religion, to detest it as Heretical, and to spit as often as it is named. After their
Baptism, they are clad in <hi>Muscovian</hi> habits, being presented with a noble Vestiment from the
Great Duke, who also allows them a Pension suitable to their quality.</p>
                     <p>There is a great number of Apostates at <hi>Moscou,</hi> where many forein Souldiers, especially
<hi>French,</hi> were rebaptised, after the War of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> about 25 years since, though they were
not acquainted with the Language of the Countrey, nor had any knowledge of the <hi>Muscovian</hi>
Religion. Which may in some measure be excusable in common Souldiers, who mind not
much what they are to expect in the other World; but my wonder is, how persons of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
such as want neither Ingenuity nor Judgement, should be induc'd to Apostatize, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
a contrary Religion, meerly for subsistence sake, as the Baron <hi>de Raymond,</hi> and Monsieur
<hi>Groin, French</hi> Gentlemen, Colonel <hi>Alexander Lesley,</hi> and Count <hi>Slakof.</hi> This last came in the
year 1640. to <hi>Holstein,</hi> and thence went into <hi>Denmark,</hi> where he pretended himself descended
from the house of <hi>Slick</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and that he had lost his Estate upon the accompt of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> believing, gave him Letters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
to the Great Duke of <hi>Muscovy.</hi> He was no sooner come to <hi>Moscou,</hi> but he
gave out, that it was purposely to change his Religion, and to be a servant to his <hi>Czaarick</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.
The Patriarch, and <hi>Muscovian</hi> Lords were the more glad to receive him because he
was accompted among them, a person of noble extraction, and great worth, which yet was
further heightned in him by his being vers'd in several Languages, especially the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>
They receiv'd him with great joy, caus'd him to be baptis'd, and the Great Duke gave him,
with the name of <hi>Leo Alexander Slick,</hi> and the quality of <hi>Knez,</hi> a Pension of 200. Crowns a
moneth. He made his Addresses to the Princess <hi>Irene Michaelouna,</hi> and was so fond as to think,
the Great Duke would have bestowed his own Sister on him; so that hearing, there were two
persons of quality dispatch'd away to Negotiate the Princesse's marriage with a forein Prince,
he fell into such a melancholy, that he came not to himself again, till they had given him a
Daughter of one of the greatest <hi>Bojares</hi> in the Kingdom. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> coming after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to hear of this man's carriage, and understanding withall, that, far from being of the
Illustrious house of <hi>Slick,</hi> he was a subject of Count <hi>Gaspar</hi>'s, of <hi>Denhof,</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> and that
he had surpriz'd him in his recommendatory Letters, he sent notice thereof to the Great Duke,
who reproach'd him with his dissimulation and imposture, but suffer'd him to enjoy what he
had bestow'd on him, which he does still, under the name of <hi>Knez Leo Alexandrouits Slakou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seskie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Colonel <hi>Lesley</hi> fell into that misfortune out of weakness. He had in that quality serv'd the
Great Duke, during the first War of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> by which he had gotten a very great sum of
money. But those of his profession being not alwayes the best husbands, he soon spent what
grew every day less and less. To repair the breaches of his fortune, he thought it his best
course to return to <hi>Moscou,</hi> which he did upon occasion of an Embassy which the Queen of
<hi>Sueden</hi> sent, some time since, to the Great Duke, whereof <hi>Eric Gillenstiern,</hi> a Senator of the
Kingdom was the chief. But for as much as there was at that time, no likelyhood of any War
in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and that the Great Duke was unwilling to burthen himself with Pensions, <hi>Lesley</hi>
sent him word, that he would be content with some Lands, which he would make what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
he could of, and thereupon got a noble Mannor upon the <hi>Wolga.</hi> He was now in such a
condition, as that he might have lived like a Lord all the rest of his dayes, if his Wife's niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humour had not exasperated the Countrey-women against them. She treated them so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that being not any longer able to endure it, they complain'd of her, alleging that she forc'd
them to eat flesh on fasting dayes, that she allow'd them not the time to make their inclinations
before the Images, much less to go to Church, and, what was worst of all, that she had taken
the Images from the Walls, and cast them into the fire. There needed no more to make her odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the whole Nation. They immediately sent for <hi>Lesley</hi> and his whole Family, and the
Countrey-women, and the Colonel's Wife were brought face to face; she confess'd indeed,
that she had forc'd them to work hard, but deny'd all the rest. All the Servants that were stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
took their Oaths on her behalf, and yet the others proffering to make good their accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by enduring the torture, she could not so far clear herself, but that the Patriarch, taking cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of the business, oblig'd the Great Duke to take those Lands out of the Strangers hands,
and to put out an act, whereby it should not be lawful for any to be possess'd of such Mannors
if they were not <hi>Muscovites,</hi> either by Birth or Religion. <hi>Lesley</hi> finding himself reduc'd to his
extremity, and having not wherewith to maintain his Children and Family, declar'd, that if
the Great Duke would continue him in the said Mannor, he and his Family would change their
Religion. They take him at his word, and he, his Wife and Children are put into a Monastery,
where they are instructed and re-baptized. <hi>Ilia Danilouits Miloslauski</hi> and his Wife were pleas'd
to answer for them at their Baptism, and to be at the charge of their Wedding, it being necessary
they should be married a-new. The Great Duke made them great Presents, and, among other
things, bestow'd on them, the sum of six thousand Crowns in ready money. But the Peasants
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47786:68"/>
hearing, that, by this change of Religion, they were to be reduc'd to their former slavery, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition'd
His Majesty that they might have another Lord, and pitch'd upon Monsieur <hi>Groin,</hi> who
had revolted at the same time, and had some pretence to those Lands, as having had a promise
made him of some of that nature. So that <hi>Lesley</hi> was forc'd to content himself with a Pension
of 90. Crowns <hi>per mensem,</hi> which is the ordinary pay of a Colonel in times of Peace, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
somewhat less for his Son.</p>
                     <p>I shall here make a short digression for a Lady's sake,<note place="margin">The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of an <hi>English</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman.</note> who hath, by an admirable constancy,
made it appear, that, if Men are many times subject to the weakness of Women, it sometimes
happens that Women have those Virtues which may be exemplary to Men. There is this to be
said in commendation of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> that they never force any to profess their Religion,
unless that in a Family, the Husband or Wife be of it, in which case they suffer not the other
to continue his former profession. We said, the Baron <hi>de Raymond</hi> was one of those that
chang'd their Religion after the first War of <hi>Smolensko.</hi> He was married to an English Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Daughter (who had liv'd many years at <hi>Moscou,</hi> and whose name was <hi>William Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesley,</hi>
being the handsomest Woman of any Stranger that was in the Country) and had chang'd
his Religion rather out of fickleness, and to comply with the Great Duke, than out of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
motive, was re-baptised, and took the name of <hi>Iuan</hi> instead of that of <hi>Peter,</hi> which
had been given him at his first Baptism. According to the Law of the Country, his Wife was
to follow his Example, which to effect, her Husband used all means imaginable, but found so
great a constancy on the other side, that he was forc'd to recurr to the Authority of the Great
Duke and Patriarch. These at first went mildly to work, offering her very great advantages in
their Religion: but the young Gentlewoman, though but 15. years of age, was inflexible, cast
her self at the Great Duke's feet, and entreated him rather to take away her life, than force her
to embrace a Belief, which she was not satisfy'd of in her Conscience. The Father us'd the same
submissions, but the Patriarch put him off with kicks, and told him that she was to be treated
as a Child, that she knew not what was for the good of her Soul, and that she must be baptized
whether she would or no. Accordingly she was put into the hands of certain Religious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who violently dragg'd her to a Brook, where she was re-baptized, notwithstanding the
protestations she made, that that pretended Baptism, which they then gave her against her own
consent, could not blot out the Character, which her first true Baptism had imprinted in her
Soul. When they plunged her in the water, she drew one of the Religious Women in along
with her, and when they would oblige her to detest her former Religion, she spit in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and would never abjure. After her Baptism, they sent her to <hi>Stuatka,</hi> where her Husband
was <hi>Weywode,</hi> and there she stay'd till her Husband's three years Government was expired, who
dying soon after his return to <hi>Moscou,</hi> she thought she might re-assume her former Habit, as
she was a Stranger, and profess her former Religion, which was the <hi>Protestant.</hi> But that
would not be permitted, her two Sons were taken from her, and she, with a little Daughter,
was sent to the Monastery of <hi>Belossora,</hi> some 10. or 12. leagues from <hi>Moscou,</hi> where she liv'd
five years among the Nuns, and was never suffer'd to speak with any one that could give her the
least account of her Friends, or Children. During all that time, she heard from them but once,
by the means of a Tiler, a <hi>German,</hi> who, under pretence of calling his Boy, and shewing him
the Tiles he wanted, directed the disconsolate Lady to a place where she should find Letters.
The Patriarch dying, she got out of the Monastery, and his Successor allow'd her the liberty of
her Conscience at her own House, as also to give and receive visits: but they would never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
her to go to Sermons. I often visited her while she was in that condition, and have heard,
that this Virtuous Lady died some two years since, firm and constant in the profession of her
Religion to the last gasp. To which I may add, by the way, that it is not long since, that her
Father <hi>William Barnesley</hi> died in <hi>England,</hi> having attained the age of 126. years, after he had
married a second Wife, at 100.</p>
                     <p>Those <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who change their Religion in other Countries, and would return to
their Communion, must be first re-baptized; which is the more observable, in that the <hi>Greek</hi>
Religion, though she approves not the Baptism of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, yet seems to be satisfy'd
with the former which they might have receiv'd in their Church, so as not to oblige Converts
to re-baptization upon their change of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Their Festivals and Feasts are regulated and certain, and they observe them very strictly.
Till within these few years, the <hi>Muscovites</hi> thought they kept Holy-day well enough, when
they had been at Mass in the morning, though they spent the rest of the day in their ordinary
Employments; insomuch that at the time of our first Embassy, upon Sundayes, and Holy-dayes,
shops were open, and Merchants and Tradesmen were at work; it being, as they said, only
for great Lords to mind their enjoyments upon Holy-dayes. But the present Patriarch, hath
ordered shops to be shut, not only upon Sundayes, but also on Wednesdayes and Fridayes,
which are their Fasting dayes, not permitting the Taverns to sell Wine or Aquavitae in Service
time.</p>
                     <p>Their great Festivals, besides Sunday, are thirteen, and, according to their year, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins

                     <p>They celebrate the Feast of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the morrow after <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and that of <hi>All-Saints,</hi>
upon the Sunday following.</p>
                     <p>No day in the year but is the particular Feast of some Saint, sometimes of two or three, but
the people observe them not. Only Ecclesiasticks are oblig'd to say the Offices of those dayes.
They have their perpetual <hi>Almanack,</hi> according to the <hi>Old-stile,</hi> wherein, without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they find all the Feasts both moveable and immoveable.</p>
                     <p>Upon the great Festivals and Sundayes, they go thrice to Church; first in the morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
day, to <hi>Mattens,</hi> which they call <hi>Sasterim;</hi> at noon, to the <hi>Obedny;</hi> and in the evening,
to <hi>Wadschemi,</hi> or <hi>Vespers.</hi> The whole Service consists in the reading of certain Chapters out
of the Bible, Psalms, and St. <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s Creed: whereto they sometimes add a Homily out
of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and certain Prayers, which they sing, much after the same manner as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphona's</hi>
are sung, saying ever and anon their <hi>Gospodi Pomilui,</hi> Lord have mercy upon me, which
the people repeats three times, making the sign of the Cross. This done, the Priest goes up to
the Altar, attended by a Clerk, and sayes the Office, according to the Liturgy of great St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil.</hi>
He pours Claret-Wine and Water into the Chalice, with some little bits of Bread, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
them, and sayes certain Prayers, which ended, he takes out the Bread with a spoon, but
gives not of it to any other, unless some sick Child be brought, to whom he gives the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
If the Priest hath known his Wife that day, he is not to come near the Altar, but must
get Mass said by another. The people stand all the service time, and incessantly bow themselves
before the Images, pronouncing the <hi>Gospodi Pomilui.</hi> They read only the bare Text of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and certain Homilies, as we said before, giving this reason for it, that the Holy Spirit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grounded the Church upon the pure Word of God, without any explication, neither are
they to trouble themselves with any, since that the different interpretations of it, do partly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
the Errours and Heresies, whereby the Church is divided. About five years since, the
Protopope of <hi>Morum,</hi> taking upon him to Preach, and making use of God's Word, to exhort
the people to Piety, the Patriarch deposed him, together with all the other Priests that would
have follow'd his example, excommunicated them, and banish'd them into <hi>Siberia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have made a certain Book, wherein they treat the Histories of the Gospel after a strange
manner, and adulterate them with so many fabulous, impious, and impertinent circumstances,
that it is not to be much admired that vice and sin reign among them, when they are furnish'd
with examples thereof in their Books of Devotion. This minds me of a story, which the <hi>Danish</hi>
Gentleman, I have elsewhere spoken of, relates in his Travels into <hi>Muscovy.</hi> Discoursing one
day with his <hi>Pristaf,</hi> concerning matters of Religion, the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> whose name was <hi>Foedor,</hi>
a man well stricken in years, told him, that there was no great harm in contracting a habit of
sinning daily, provided a man had an intention to repent him of it at the point of death, and
brought for his reason the example of <hi>Mary Magdalene.</hi> This <hi>Mary,</hi> said he, was a profess'd
Curtezan, so that it is not to be doubted but she offended God very often. Yet it happened one
day, she met a man upon the high-way, who desired of her that kindness which she had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
any other: but, those even of her profession being not alwayes in the same humour, she
would do nothing, till such time as the man desir'd her to do it for God's sake: That then she
satisfy'd his desire, and that doing, for God's sake, what she was unwilling to do out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance,
the action became so meritorious, that she had not only expiated all her other Sins,
by that Act of Charity, but also deserv'd to be put in red letters in the Books of the Saints.
There is no Evangelical story which they have not thus adulterated, and dress up in circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
no less abominable.</p>
                     <p>They are all bare in the Church, even the Great Duke himself. Only their Priests have on
their <hi>Skufia,</hi> or Caps, which are given them at their Consecration. VVhen they make their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47786:69"/>
to the Images, they often make the sign of the Cross, with three fingers of the right
hand, touching, first, the fore-head, then the breast, then the right shoulder, and lastly the
left. And that it might not be thought this is done without Mystery, they say, the three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
signify the <hi>Trinity,</hi> putting them to the fore-head, they would signify, that <hi>Christ</hi> is As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
into Heaven; to the breast, that a man should love God with all his heart; and the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of them from the right shoulder to the left, puts them in mind of the day of Judgement,
when God shall place the Righteous on his right hand, and the Wicked on the left; those, to
be called to eternal Salvation; these, to be tumbled down into the abysses of Hell. The <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
undertake not any thing, but they first make the sign of the Cross, as eating, drinking,
or any other civil actions.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Images,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> they confess there were not any in Churches, during the first Centuries, and
till the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, or if there were, they were not honoured with any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
but that they are used, only to represent the stories of the Bible. They say, that they
follow herein the opinion of <hi>Iohn Damascene:</hi> but it is most likely they have it from the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church, with which, they suffer not any that are carved or graven, as being forbidden in the
Decalogue, but they have Images painted with oil upon wood, wretchedly coloured, and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned,
about a foot in breadth, somewhat more in length. They will not meddle with
them if they are not made by one of their Religion, though they came from the best Painter's
hand in <hi>Europe.</hi> At <hi>Moscou,</hi> there is a particular Market-place for Images, where nothing else
is sold, though they call that kind of Commerce, bartering or trucking with money, out of a
belief they have, that the names of <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>selling</hi> carry not respect enough in them, for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
things. Heretofore they oblig'd strangers to have of them in their houses, that their <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi>
Servants might be thereby excited to the exercise of their Devotion: But the present Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
permits not, they should be profaned by the <hi>Germans;</hi> insomuch, that <hi>Charles du
Moulin,</hi> having bought a stone house, the Seller scrap'd the wall, where an Image had been
painted, and carried away what he had scrap'd off. The Peasants would not permit us to touch
them, not to turn our feet towards them when we lay down. Nay, some were at the charge of
Incense to purify them, after we had left their Houses.</p>
                     <p>The walls of their Churches are full of them, and they represent, for the most part, our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> Patron of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> or the particular Saints they make
choice of for the principal object of their Devotions. Those who commit sins deserving excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
are oblig'd to cause their Saint to be taken away, who is not to be suffer'd in their
Churches, no more than their persons. Great Persons, and Rich Merchants adorn their Images
with Pearls and other precious Stones. All <hi>Muscovites</hi> look upon them as things so necessary,
as that without Images they could not say their prayers; which whenever they do, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
set Wax-candles before their Saint, and look very stedfastly upon him, as long as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
lasts.</p>
                     <p>When a <hi>Muscovite</hi> comes into a House, or Chamber, he saies not a word, till he hath fixt
his eyes on the Saint he looks for, which they ordinarily hang in a corner behind the Table, or
if he finds him not, he askes, <hi>Iest le Boch,</hi> where is the God? Assoon as he perceives him, he
makes him one very low reverence, or more, and pronounces at every time, <hi>Gospodi Pomilui:</hi>
then he turns to the Company and salutes them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muscovites</hi> respect their Images, as if there were somewhat of Divinity in them, and
they attribute unto them the virtue of Miracles, whereof we had this example in the year 1643.
that an old Image beginning to change colour, and to turn a little reddish, they immediately
cry'd out, <hi>a Miracle.</hi> The Great Duke and the Patriarch were frighted thereat, as if that red
colour presag'd some misfortune to either the Prince or the people; nay, they had sent out Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for extraordinary fasts and publick prayers to be made all over the Kingdom, if the Painters
who were sent for to have their advise in this affair, had not all assured them, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
they should be troubled at, since there was nothing extraordinary, but that Time, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
consum'd and eaten out the paint, had only discover'd the first colour of the wood, which
was red.</p>
                     <p>Their Monks and Priests have nevertheless the art to make them do Miracles, or to observe
such things in them as oblige the people to extraordinary Devotions, which must not want their
offerings, that the Priest may not want his advantage. The City of <hi>Archangel</hi> furnishes us with
a good example to this purpose, of two Priests there, who, having got together a vast sum of
money by their Impostures, must needs fall out at the parting of it, and upbraid one another of
their cheats, so loudly, that the Magistrate coming to hear of it, they had thirty lashes a-piece,
with the Executioner's good will, after the manner we have before described their whipping.
These Juglers put the people into continual frights, and besot them with so strange a venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for their Images, that in their greatest dangers, their recourse is only to them. <hi>Iacob de la
Gardie,</hi> General of the <hi>Suedish</hi> Army, having in the year 1610. taken the City of <hi>Novogorod,</hi>
some part of it was set a-fire, and one of the Inhabitants seeing his House all of a flame, presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thereto an Image of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> entreating it to stay the progress of the furious Element,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47786:69"/>
which was ready to ruine him. But perceiving the fire went on still, he flung his Image into it,
saying to it, that since it would not help him, let it help it self, and quench the fire if it would.
It was then also observ'd, that the <hi>Suedish</hi> Souldiers, not finding any thing in their Houses,
carried away the Images of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> and by that means oblig'd them to follow them,
and to redeem their <hi>Saints</hi> at a very dear rate.</p>
                     <p>The first thing they teach their Children, is to make their reverences and inclinations to the
Images. At <hi>Ladoga</hi> I lodg'd at a Womans House, who would not give his breakfast to a Child
she had, who could hardly either stand or speak, till he had first made nine inclinations before
the Saint, and as often, as well as he could pronounce it, said his <hi>Gospodi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is it to be thought, but that among so great a number of innocent persons, there are
some so well instructed, as to see a glimpse of truth through these thick Clouds of ignorance.
There was at <hi>Russian Narva</hi> a rich Merchant, who is still living, one that came often to visit
the Ambassadors, and dined with them. He discours'd very rationally, and would say, that
he did not approve the opinion, which the rest of the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have of their Saints, nor
the worship of their Images, and he did not expect his Salvation from Colours, which he
might wipe out with his handkercher, and from wood, which it was in his power to cast into
the fire: That he found in the Holy Scripture, which he had attentively read over, much more
solid comforts, and such foundations for his happiness, as could not be shaken: That their
Fasting signify'd nothing, when, instead of eating Flesh, they glutted themselves with the best
sorts of Fish, and the most delicious Hydromel, and Aquavitae: That bread and water might
suffice those who were desirous to fast, and that prayer was the best part of that mortification.
The Ambassadors ask'd him, why, having all these good sentiments about him, he had not
withall the Charity to inspire them into his Country-men? He answered, that it was not his
calling, and that, if he endeavour'd it, he should not prevail, because he was already look'd
on as a Heretick among them: That he suffer'd Images in his House, but, only for the honour
of God, and to honour the memory of the Saints: That he had a Picture of the King of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s,
and kept it, for the Heroick actions done by that Prince, and that he conceiv'd he might
do the like with those of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and the <hi>Saints,</hi> who had not only done great actions, but
also Miracles. We found by the sequel of his discourse that he knew all the reasons alleged by
the <hi>Greeks</hi> at the Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi> against those whom they called <hi>Iconomachi,</hi> in the
year 787. against which Council <hi>Charlemaign</hi> called, in the year 797. that of <hi>Frankford,</hi> in
which the Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks</hi> concerning Images was condemned and anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
                     <p>Not long since, a Protopope of <hi>Casanskey,</hi> whose name was <hi>Iuan Neronou,</hi> began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
against the honour done to Images, charging those with Idolatry who worshipped Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and Wood. He said, that if there were any veneration due to Images, that they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to admire, in man, that of God, and to honour the Painter, rather than the Images made
by him. But the Patriarch soon took an order with this Priest, degraded him, and shut him up
in the Monastery called <hi>Cameno Monastir,</hi> upon the River <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the wood of their Images comes to rot, they do not cast it away, but throw
it into the River, that the water may carry it away; or they bury it in some Garden,
or Church-yard.</p>
                     <p>The Saints of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> as well as those of other places, have their Miracles. <hi>Possevin</hi>
says, they are all Fables, and that the stories related of them are ridiculous. They have one
of a very late date, named <hi>Sudatworets Philip Metropolite,</hi> of the House of <hi>Colitziou.</hi> He li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the reign of the Tyrant <hi>Iohn Basilouits,</hi> and grew famous for the remonstrances he made
to that Prince of his wicked life. The Tyrant, troubled thereat, sent him into a Monastery far
from <hi>Moscou,</hi> so as that he might be no longer importun'd with his reproaches: but the other
made the Pen do what his tongue could not, and, from time to time, represented the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God to the Eyes of the Great Duke, so pressingly, that the other not able any longer
to endure his reprehensions, sent one of his Servants to strangle him. The Executioner found
him ready enough to dy, with this desire only, that, instead of strangling him with a Cord,
he would run him with a Knife into the Heart; which he accordingly did. The Monks of the
Monastery put him into the Catalogue of their Holy Martyrs, and sent his Body to be buried
in the Island of <hi>Solofka,</hi> in the <hi>White Sea,</hi> near <hi>Archangel,</hi> where they say he hath done many
Miracles. The present Patriarch perswaded the Great Duke, that, while he was Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane
of <hi>Rostou,</hi> and <hi>Iarislau,</hi> he had heard that many sick persons had been healed there, and
that the Body of the Saint was as whole as the day he was kill'd, and prevail'd with him to have
it translated from <hi>Solofka</hi> to <hi>Moscou.</hi> The Miracles which are known to have been really done
at the translation thereof, are these: <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Knez Michael Levontgewits,</hi> who was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
to see it done, going thither with a <hi>Diak,</hi> and his two Sons, and having embark'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with some of his retinue in a great open Boat, he got safely into the Island, but it could
never be known what became of the three others, and all those that were with them. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Miracle was, that the Great Duke, the Patriarch, and all the Court going a league out
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47786:70"/>
of <hi>Moscou,</hi> to meet the Saint, the Metropolitane of <hi>Rostou</hi> and <hi>Iaroslau,</hi> named <hi>Warlam,</hi> being
a corpulent fat Man, and about 70. years of age, wearied with so small a Journey, fell down
stock-dead, As soon as he came to the shrine. Which at least, is as certain as what the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
say of the great number of the blind, dumb, deaf, lame, persons troubled with agues,
and paraliticks, whom that body hath healed, since it was placed in the great Church of the
Castle. At first, no week pass'd, but it did five or six Miracles: but now it doth not any at
all, and they say it is by reason of the incredulity of the people, that that Virtue hath left the
Saints Body; which they say is still intire: but it is forbidden, upon pain of death, for any
man to lift up the cloath which covers it.</p>
                     <p>In the Monastery of <hi>Troitza,</hi> 12. leagues from <hi>Moscou,</hi> they have another Saint named <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</hi>
He was a very tall man, a thing the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have a great veneration for, and had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
been a Soldier; but the crimes and disorders he had committed in his youth, touch'd his
Conscience so to the quick, that he forsook the World, and turn'd Hermite. He quitted that
solitary kind of life, and got into the Monastery of <hi>Troitza,</hi> where he was soon chosen <hi>Igumine,</hi>
or Abbot, and did there, with his Disciple <hi>Nikon,</hi> so many Miracles, that, dying in the year
1563. they were both Canonized. They say, their heads are there yet to be seen intire, and
that when the <hi>Polanders</hi> besig'd that Monastery, the head of <hi>Sergius</hi> only, forc'd them back in
the midst of their assault, and made them turn their arms against themselves. Of which yet there
is nothing to be found in the History of that time, which speaks but of one siege of <hi>Troitza,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Iohn Sapiha,</hi> a <hi>Polish</hi> General, who was indeed forc'd to raise it, not upon the vigorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the Monks, or by the assistance of <hi>Sergius,</hi> but by the <hi>Suedish</hi> Army, which came in to
the relief of the <hi>Muscovites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since this Saint was buried there, that Monastery hath been called <hi>Zergeofski Troitza,</hi> though
it be properly dedicated to the <hi>Trinity.</hi> It is so rich, that it maintains above 300. Monks, and
its revenue increases dayly, through the Great Duke's liberality, and the alms of those who go
thither to perform their Vows, they had made in their travels or sickness; and settle Annuities
for Service to be said after their death. The Great Duke, who goes thither twice a year, lights
off his Horse when he is come within half a league of the Monastery, and so walks it. Having
ended his Devotions, he spends some dayes there in Hunting, during which, the Abbot main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
him and his retinue, both with Man's meat and Horse meat.</p>
                     <p>Some years since, the <hi>Muscovites</hi> found an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> at <hi>Casan,</hi> and sent
a copy of it to <hi>Moscou,</hi> where there is a Church built for the reception of it in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
near that street where the Cutlers have their shops. The Church is called <hi>Precista Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanska,</hi>
the holy mother of <hi>Casan,</hi> and many Pilgrimages are made to it. They go also in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
to the Monastery of <hi>Chutina,</hi> a league and a half from <hi>Novogorod,</hi> to the Sepulchre of
their Saint <hi>Warlam,</hi> who was born at <hi>Novogorod,</hi> and buried at <hi>Chutina,</hi> whence they call his
Festival, <hi>Prasnick Warlama Chutinskoga.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to their Churches,<note place="margin">Their Churches.</note> we said, there were above two thousand Churches and Chapels in the
City and Suburbs of <hi>Moscou.</hi> Those which are of stone are round and vaulted, because God's
Houses ought to represent Heaven which is his Throne. They have neither Seats nor Benches,
by reason none sit down, but all say their prayers either standing or kneeling. The late Great
Duke, who was much given to Devotion, lay all along upon the ground, when he said his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
They have no <hi>Organs</hi> or other musical instruments in their Churches, not using any, out
of this perswasion, that things inanimate cannot glorify God; That they were allow'd in the
Paedagogy of the Law, but that, under the new Testament, they were no more to be used than
any other of the Jewish Ceremonies. The Patriarch that now is hath shewn his enmity to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
yet greater, in prohibiting the use of all those musical instruments, which the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
were wont to make use of at their merry meetings. Some four or five years since, he caused all
private houses to be search'd, for Instruments, and having loaden five Wagons with them, he
sent them over the River of <hi>Moscou,</hi> where they were all burnt. Only the <hi>Germans</hi> kept
theirs, nor could the Patriarch, with all his Authority, oblige the Bojar, <hi>Boris Nikita Iuanou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its
Romanou.</hi> to put away his Musicians. There is no Stone-Church, but hath, in the midst of
four Turrets, a Tower form'd at the top much like the Knobs we set on Bedsteads, having upon
it a triple Cross, by which they say they represent our Saviour, as Head of the Church, saying,
that the Cross being the Badge of Christianity, it is necessary the Church of Christ should be
known by it. They hold, they are prophaned by Strangers, that is to say, such as are not of
their Communion; upon which account it was, that when, at the beginning of our Travels,
we entred into them, they came and thrust us out, and many times they swept after us. If it
chance a Dog gets in, they think it not enough to sweep the Church, but they also Incense it,
and purify it with holy Water. They have also very much respect for their Church-yards, and
suffer not that any should make their water in them.</p>
                     <p>Their Bells are not in steeples, but in a certain Engine, or Machine, near the Church, in the
Church-yard, and are for the most part so small, that few of them are 150. or 200. pound
weight. They toll them at the beginning of service, and at the Elevation of the Chalice, for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47786:70"/>
the Bread being put in immediately after Consecration, they make but one Elevation. The
Rope is not fasten'd to the Bell, but to the Clapper, so that one man may toll three or four
Bells at the same time, if the Ropes be fasten'd to both his Elbows and both his hands, which,
making a certain chiming, the <hi>Muscovites</hi> are much taken with. But this kind of chiming of the
almost infinite number of Bells, which they many times toll at the same time in all their
Churches, makes a very strange noise, to their ears, who are not accustomed thereto.</p>
                     <p>They think this chiming so necessary, that, without it, the divine Service would be defective.
Upon which perswasion it was, that a certain <hi>Pristaf,</hi> who conducted the <hi>Suedish</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
hearing that they were desirous to do their Devotions, it being <hi>Michaelmas</hi>- day, told
them, that he could not imagine what shift they would make to do it, since he had not, by
reason of the greatness of the Journey, brought any Bells along with him.</p>
                     <p>There is no Church but hath an Image over the door; and at every corner of a Street, and
upon all the Gates of the City, there are Images, before which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> make a halt
to say their <hi>Gospodi.</hi> They also address the <hi>Gospodi</hi> to the Crosses which are upon the Churches,
so that they goe through no Street, but they make a short stay to do their Devotions.</p>
                     <p>The Ecclesiastical Government consists of a Patriarch,<note place="margin">Their Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy.</note> several Metropolitans, Arch-Bishops,
Bishops, Arch-Deacons, Protopopes, and Priests. The Patriarch, among them, hath the same
authority as the Pope has in the <hi>Latine</hi> Church. The Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> had heretofore
the nomination of him. In time, he came to have only the confirmation of him; but now of
late; he hath lost both. <hi>Filaretes Nikitits,</hi> the late Great Duke's Father, was the last that
desired confirmation from the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> At present, the Patriarch of <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>
is chosen by the other Prelates, who meet in the great Church within the Castle, called
<hi>Sabor,</hi> and name two or three Prelats, of the most eminent for Learning and good Life, and
present them to the great Duke, who, after some conference with the Prelats, proceeds joyntly
with them, to the election; unless those that are named be all of such eminency, that they are
at a loss which to make choice of, and so forc'd to it by lott which course they took at the
Election of this last Patriarch. He was a Prelate of the Second Order, and hath been named,
with two other Metropolitans, upon the reputation of his good life. The lot falling upon him,
all those of the First Order were discontented thereat, so that they put it to the Lot a second
time, in which also it fell again to him: but the ambition of the other Competitors appearing
still in their countenances, the Great Duke was pleas'd to comply with them, and to put it to
the Lot a third time, which fell in like manner to the same Person, upon which all acquiesc'd.
His name is <hi>Nicon,</hi> and he had been before Metropolitan of <hi>Rostou</hi> and <hi>Iaroslou,</hi> and is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
45 years of age. He lives within the Palace, where he hath built him a house of stone.
He keeps a good Table, and is a person of so pleasant a disposition, that he discovers it in those
actions that require the greatest gravity. For, a handsome Gentlewoman being presented to
him, for his Benediction, after she had been re-baptized, with several others of her Friends,
he told her, that he was in some doubt, whether he should begin with the kiss, which is given
to <hi>Proselites</hi> after their Baptism, or with the Benediction.</p>
                     <p>The Patriarch's authority is so great, that he in manner divides the Soveraignty with the
Great Duke. He is the Supreme Judge of all Ecclesiastical Causes, and absolutely disposes of
what ever concerns Religion, with such power, that, in things relating to the Political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
he reforms what he conceives prejudicial to Christian simplicity and good manners,
without giving the Great Duke any accompt of it, who, without any contestation, commands
the orders made by the Patriarch to be executed. He hath under him, four Metropolitans, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Archbishops, and one Bishop. The Metropolitans are those of.</p>

Church, he gives them Orders, and an Attestation of their being received into the Priesthood.

understand not of <hi>Bishops,</hi> though the Text expresly mentions them, nor yet in the least ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that the Apostle speaks of <hi>one</hi> wife in opposition to <hi>Polygamy;</hi> but infer thence, that there
is a necessity that the Priest should marry, that so he may be the husband of one wife. This
point of the marriage of Priests makes one of the principal differences between the <hi>Muscovites,</hi>
with all the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and the <hi>Romane,</hi> which allows not the marriage of Priests. For
confirmation of their opinion, they allege, as what makes most for them, the fourth Canon of
the Councel, which was held at <hi>Gangres,</hi> in <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> not long after that of <hi>Nice,</hi> which
Anathemizes those who make any difficulty to receive the Communion from the hands of a
married Priest. But the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Priests hold this besides, that they are oblig'd to be in the
state of marriage, before they take Orders, and that they are to marry a Maid, and not a Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
or a Woman of a scandalous life: in which punctilio they are so circumspect, that if a
Priest, upon search made the the first night of his marriage, find that his VVife hath been defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
before hand, he must either be divorc'd from her or from the Priesthood. The Priest who
hath given his VVife her benevolence in the night, is not to approach the Altar the next day:

may be present at the Offices of <hi>Fasterini</hi> and <hi>Vetzerni,</hi> but is not admitted to that of <hi>Obedni,</hi>
at which the Communion is receiv'd, and cannot give his Benediction to marriages. Those who
are not willing to live in that condition, and are weary of a single life, take up some other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
turn Merchants or Tradesmen, and marry again: and to do that, they are only to put

Devotion. VVhen any embrace that kind of life of their own accord, if they are of ability,
they are permitted to carry some part of their Estates along with them into the Monastery, but
are obliged to leave the remainder to their Heirs. Heretofore the more superstitious sort made
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47786:71"/>
over all they had, and the extravagance had so far prevail'd on many, that in time, the Monks
would have been Masters of the best part of <hi>Muscovy;</hi> if a course had not been taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it. They have set hours for their service, and they say most of their prayers by Beads.
Their Austerity of life is very great, in as much as they live only on Salt-fish, Honey, Milk,
Cheese, Herbs, and Pulse, especially Cowcumbers, fresh and pickled, which they mince very
small, and eat with a spoon in some of their <hi>Quas.</hi> They have this common with all the other
<hi>Muscovites,</hi> that they can hardly write and read. Not one in ten can say the Lord's Prayer,
much fewer that are acquainted with the Creed and the ten Commandments. These Monks live
not so retired a life, but that they are seen in great numbers, both in Cities, and all over the
Countrey, where their employment is the same with that of the Peasants, from whom they
are distinguish'd only by their habit. It is also true, there are abundance of <hi>Anchorets,</hi> who
build Chapels upon the High-ways, and live in Woods like <hi>Hermits,</hi> subsisting only by the
Alms given them by Travellers.</p>

from Eggs and Milk, that within these few years, some of the more devout would not use
any Sugar, because they know that there are whites of Eggs used in the clarifying
of it.</p>
                     <p>Their year consists of more fasting days than flesh days. For, besides the two days of every
week, and the Eves of great Festivals, they fast in <hi>Lent</hi> seven weeks together, though in the
first they eat Butter, Milk, and Eggs, and this week is their <hi>Carnaval,</hi> during which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
incredible excesses in drinking, and withall such insolences, as the Patriarch hath not yet
found any way to remedy. The next week, they eat only Honey, Herbs, and Pulse, and drink
only <hi>Quas</hi> and Water; they bath, and cleanse themselves from the impurities they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in their excessive debauches. All the rest of the <hi>Lent</hi> they live very temperately, and
the most devout eat no fish but on Sundays. Their second <hi>Lent</hi> begins eight days after <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suntide,</hi>
and lasts till St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s tide. The third is from the first of <hi>August,</hi> to the <hi>16th.</hi> and
the fourth, from the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> to <hi>Christmas.</hi> 'Tis true, there are some abate of this
great Austerity; but I never knew any <hi>Muscovite,</hi> who did not strictly observe abstinence
during the <hi>Lent.</hi> But as they will not by any means be dispens'd with as to that time, no not
in their greatest sickness; so can they not, on the other side, be perswaded to eat fish on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
and Holydays out of <hi>Lent,</hi> as believing that it is of Apostolical institution that they should
eat flesh on Sundays, and that they are bound to observe the Rule which goes under the name
of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> in the Tomes of the Councels printed at <hi>Venice,</hi> which says, that an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick,
who fasts on Saturday or Sunday, is to be degraded, and if a lay person commit the
same fault, he is to be excommunicated. The same Rule which enjoyns them to abstain
from flesh in <hi>Lent,</hi> forbids them also medling with their Wives during that time, upon
special penalties.</p>
                     <p>Those who are come to years of discretion are oblig'd to go to <hi>Confession,</hi> before they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.<note place="margin">Their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note>
There are very few but receive the Communion at <hi>Easter,</hi> and they prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for it by extraordinary mortifications, for eight days together, during which they eat
nothing but a hard kind of bread, and drink only Water and <hi>Quas,</hi> which is so sowr, that it
causes gripings in the belly, and brings them in a manner to deaths door. They make their
Confession standing, in the midst of the Church, and before an Image, on which they have
their eyes fastned, as long as the Confession lasts, making a very particular recital of all their
sins, and at every sin expressing their remorse, and promising amendment. The Priest, with
the absolution, gives them a certain penance to do, which consists for the most part in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
several times the <hi>Gospody Pomilui,</hi> or in making a certain number of Reverences before the
Saints, abstaining from Women for a certain time, standing at the Church door: or, if the sins
be very hainous, he enjoyns them to make use of a Holy-water, which they Consecrate upon
<hi>Twelfth</hi>-day, and is kept by the Priests all the year long for that purpose, and not to be had of
them for nothing. They make accompt that that water hath the vertue to cleanse them of their
sins, and to restore them into the state of Grace.</p>
                     <p>They receive the Communion, ordinarily, upon <hi>Easter</hi>-Eve; at least they think it must
be done upon a fasting-day,<note place="margin">Their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> and this they so strictly observe, that if one should Communicate
on the Sunday, yet is he not to eat any flesh that day. They Communicate in both kinds, and
mix water with the Wine. The bread they put into the Wine, taking out a morsel, together
with some of the Wine, with a spoon. The bread is leavened, and must have been made up
and baked by a Priest's Widow: which they think to be so Essential to the Sacrament, that one
of the principal causes of the Schism between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Church, is, that the latter
makes use of unleavened bread contrary to the express institution of our Saviour, who, to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the Ceremony of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who made use of unleavened bread, was pleased to take ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
bread. This Communion bread is about twice as big, and somewhat thicker than a Crown
piece, and hath in the middle the figure of the Crucifix. After the Priest hath Consecrated it,
he takes off that figure with an instrument made much after the fashion of a Launce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and puts it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47786:72"/>
up into a wooden box, which hangs above the Altar, that the Rats and Mice may not come at
it. When the Communion is to be Administred to a sick person, they take a little out of the
said box, upon which they pour three drops of Claret-wine, and put it into the Chalice, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
sometimes a little water, and so they give it the sick person with a spoon. But if, through
weakness or otherwise, he be not able to get down the bread, they give him only a little Wine
consecrated. In the ordinary Administration of the Communion, they make use of a sort of
Consecrated bread, of the same form as the other, but not bigger than a half Crown, from
which they also take away the Crucifix, and break it into as many pieces as there are Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants,
cast them into Claret-wine, and put thereto a little <hi>warm</hi> water, because no doubt
but the blood and water, which came out of our Saviour's side, was <hi>so.</hi> They hold <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi>
and, at the Administring of the Sacrament, the Priest sayes these words: <hi>This is the
true body and the true bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ, which hath been given for thee, and for many
more, for the Remission of thy sins, which thou shalt take in remembrance of him. God bless thee.</hi>
The more devout sort sleep after they have receiv'd the Communion, that so they may not Sin
that day. What remains of the bread after Consecration serves for holy-bread. They call it
<hi>Kutja,</hi> and the Sunday following, the Priest gives a morsel of it to each of those who had
Communicated the week before. There is no Child so young but they give him the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but it is only when he is Sick, and then but in one kind, till he be seven years of age, and
then he is Communicated as the rest; for which they give this reason, that about that age one
begins to Sin mortally. No doubt, they have derived this custom from what was done in the
third age, wherein St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> sayes, that they Communicated Children immediately after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
which custom was continued till St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s time. But in Process of time the custom
was changed, since that, as <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> the son of <hi>Calistus,</hi> who lived in the 14th. age, affirms,
that in his time, they gave those Children, who were learning the first Rudiments of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
but only the Consecrated bread which was remaining after the Communion. In <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
they also give the Communion to distracted persons; but they only touch their lips with
the bread after it hath lain a while in the VVine.</p>
                     <p>The Priest who hath kiss'd a dead body, or been at the interment of any, can neither conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
nor administer the Sacrament that day, for they hold him to be defiled. Nor is it lawful
for him to Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nicate a VVoman in Child-bed, in the same room where she was delivered:
but she is obliged to get her self carried into some other place, and to be washed. Heretofore,
they were wont to send the Consecrated bread into the Countrey, to those places which were
destitute of a Priest; nay, they gave of it to such as intended to travel, or were going to the
VVars, who made their Confessions before their departure, and were to Communicate when
they had any convenience to do it, or were in any danger of death, so to make it, as it were,
their last <hi>Viaticum.</hi> Their custom of receiving the Consecrated VVine in the Church, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
away the bread, to be taken at home; as also that practised by <hi>Anchoretes,</hi> who carried
away both to the places of their retirement, is so antient, that St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> nay, even <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
speaks of it, as a thing very ordinarily done in their times: but this kind of Communicating
is now absolutely abolish'd in <hi>Muscovy,</hi> as well as other places. Those who have taken their
Oaths in any Law business, or have committed murther, or any other hainous sin, are not to
receive the Communion, but at the point of death. All that are sick to that extremity are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
and at the same time receive extreme Unction, but that once done, they suffer them
not to take any thing else, not ought of nourishment, unless they apparently perceive that the
sick party begins to recover strength, and gives them a great assurance of the retrival of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
health. Before the receiving of the Communion, they give those that are sick, some fair
water, or Aquavitae, wherein some Relicks had been put. There are those, who, in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
cause themselves to be shaven, put on Monks habit, and become really such; for, that
once done, they are not suffer'd to take any thing for the space of eight dayes; it being their
perswasion, that those who take that habit, which they call <hi>Seraphick,</hi> are not to be numbred
among men, but are become Angels. And if, after those eight dayes abstinency, they recover
their former health, they are oblig'd to perform their vow, and to go into a Monastery, because
the Rasour hath pass'd upon their heads.</p>
                     <p>Their interrements are accompany'd by abundance of Ceremonies,<note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</note> as indeed are all their
publick actions. As soon as the sick person is departed, they send for all his Kindred and Friends,
who being come into the house stand about the body, excite one another to bemoan him, as it
were to heighten the Lamentations of the VVomen, and ask the deceased, why he would dye?
VVhether his affairs were in a good condition? VVhether he wanted meat and drink? VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his VVife were not handsom and young enough? VVhether she had been unconstant to
him? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then they send a present of Beer, Aquavitae and Hydromel to the Priest, that he
may pray for the Soul of the deceased party. The body is well washed, and after they have
put a clean shirt, or a shrowd about him, they put on his feet a pair of new shooes, of a very
thin <hi>Russia</hi> leather, and so lay him into the Coffin with his Arms cross the breast. Their
Coffins are made of the Trunk of a Tree, and are to be sold every where. It is cover'd with a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47786:72"/>
Cloath, or haply with some Coat of the deceased, and carried to Church. If it be a rich
man, and that the season of the year permit it, he is not buried so soon, but kept above ground
eight or ten dayes, during which, the Priest comes to incense the Corps, and cast holy water
on it every day.</p>
                     <p>The Funeral solemnity is after this manner. First there goes a Priest, carrying the Image of
the Saint which had been assign'd the deceas'd at his baptism for his Patron. Next go four Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
of the next of Kin to the deceased, who are to go as Mourners, and who fill the air with
their horrid cries and lamentations, keeping such exact time, that they both give over, and then
begin all together. Then follows the body, carried by six men upon their shoulders; and if it
be a Monk or Nun, some of their own Profession do them that Office. The Priests go all about
the body, and incense it all the way, to keep off evil spirits, and withall sing certain Psalms.
The Kindred and Friends follow the body, but without any order, having every one a VVax-Candle
in his hand.</p>
                     <p>Being come to the Grave, the Coffin is uncover'd, and the Image of the deceased party's
Saint is held over him, while the Priest sayes certain prayers, in which there come often these
words, <hi>Lord look upon this Soul in Righteousness,</hi> as also some passages of their Liturgy, during
which the VViddow continues her lamentations, and makes the same questions she had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Then the Kindred and Friends take leave of the deceased, kissing either him or the
Coffin; and at last the Priest comes up to him, and puts between his fingers a piece of paper,
which is a kind of Testimonial of his behaviour in this world, signed by the Patriarch, or the
Metropolitane of the place, and the Confessor, who sell those papers dear or cheap, according
to their abilities who buy them. This Testimonial, which is a kind of Pass for his admittance
into the other VVorld, runs thus. <hi>We, whose names are hereunto subscribed, the Patriarch, or
Metropolitane, and Priest of the Citie of N. do make known and Certifie, by these presents, that
the Bearer of these our Letters hath alwayes lived among us like a good Christian, professing the</hi>
Greek <hi>Religion; and though he hath committed some sins, yet that he hath confessed the same, and
that thereupon he hath received absolution, and taken the Communion, for the Remission of his sins:
That he hath honoured God and his Saints; That he hath said his prayers, and that he hath fasted
on the hours and dayes appointed by the Church, and that he hath carried himself so well towards
me who am his Confessor, that I have no reason to complain of him, nor to deny him the Absolution of
his sins. In witness whereof, we have given him the present Testimonial, to the end, that upon
sight thereof, St.</hi> Peter <hi>may open unto him the Gate of eternal bliss.</hi> As soon as he hath this Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
given him, the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>in is shut up, and put into the Grave, with the face of the deceased
turn'd towards the East. Those who accompany'd him thither, do their Devotions to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and return to the house of the deceased, where they find Dinner ready, and where, many
times, they drown their affliction, with all other sentiments of mortality, in Hydromel and
Aquavitae. Their mourning lasts 40. dayes, during which they make three Feasts for the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and Friends of the deceased, to wit, the 3d. the 9<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> and the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> day, after the burial.
VVherein they imitate the modern <hi>Greeks,</hi> though these, instead of the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> take the 40<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
day; upon this ground, that about that time, the heart corrupts, as the body begins to putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
towards the ninth, and the face is disfigured, the third.</p>
                     <p>Some build Huts over their Graves, which they cover with Mat, for the convenience of the
Priest, who, morning and evening, for the space of six weeks together, is to make prayers
there for the deceased. For though the <hi>Muscovites</hi> do not believe there is any <hi>Purgatory,</hi> yet
they say there are two several places, to which the Souls retire, after their departure out of
the body, where they expect the day of Judgement: some in a pleasant and delightful place,
having the conversation of Angels; others, in a sad and dark Valley, having the society of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;
That the Souls being yet in their way, may be diverted out of the evil way, by the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Priests and Monks, nay, that these have so great an Interest with God, as to obtain a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ease and alleviation of their misery, for those Souls which are with the Devils, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
him against the day of Judgement. Such as are of ability, gives Alms dayly during the
six weeks; which may indeed be ordinary among the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who make no difficulty to
inrich themselves any way, and believe that sin is to be expiated by Alms. VVhence it comes,
that no <hi>Muscovite</hi> almost, but, as he goes to Church, or about his occasions, buyes bread,
which he afterwards distributes among the poor, who, though very numerous, yet get so much,
that being not able to consume all themselves, they dry up the rest in an Oven, and make it a
kind of Bisket, which they call <hi>Suchari;</hi> and sell it in the Market to Travellers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muscovites</hi> tollerate all sorts of Religions, and suffer all Nations to live among
them, as <hi>Calvinists, Lutherans, Armenians, Tartars, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> excepting none, but
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. There is a great number of <hi>Protestants</hi> all over <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and
in the City of <hi>Moscou</hi> it self, there are above a thousand, who have the free exercise of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Those of the <hi>Reform'd</hi> Religion and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> had their Churches heretofore in
the quarter of <hi>Czaargorod;</hi> but it is about twenty years since that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> lost theirs, by
the imprudence of their Wives: because those of Merchants would not give place to the Officers
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47786:73"/>
wives, who indeed for the most part were but servant-maids dress'd up a little finer than they
had gone before: The contestation grew so high, that they came from words to blows, in the
very Church, with so much scandal, that the Patriarch, then accidentally passing by, having
understood the occasion of their falling out, commanded the Church to be demolish'd, which
was immediately done. But they were permitted to build another in the quarter of <hi>Bolsoigorod.</hi>
They took away their Church from those of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion, because, not content
with the wooden Chapel which had been given them within the White-wall, they would needs
build there an Edifice of stone, which was in a manner finish'd, when the Patriarch, who had
not given his consent for the doing of it, caused both to be pull'd down. Now, Foreiners have
neither Church nor Houses within the City. For the <hi>Germans</hi> finding themselves exposed to
the derision of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> after the Patriarch had ordered them to go in a habit distinct from
that of the Inhabitants of the Country, to free themselves out of that persecution, Petition'd the
<hi>Czaar</hi> to protect them against the outrages and affronts they dayly received. On the other side,
the Priests complained, that strangers built on their foundations, and lessened the revenue of the
livings; so that the Great Duke, to please both sides, assigned them, without the City, near
the Gate called <hi>Pokrofki,</hi> a place big enough to contain all the Houses of Foreiners, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
demolish'd those they had in the City, and in a short time made up that part of the
Suburbs, which is called <hi>Nova Inasemska Slaboda,</hi> where the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have two Churches,
and those of the <hi>Reformation</hi> two more, one for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the other for the <hi>English;</hi> and
where they have this further satisfaction, that they converse but little with the <hi>Muscovites,</hi>
and are out of all danger of those frequent fires, which commonly begin in the houses of those
barbarous <hi>Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and those of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion live very quietly together, and the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
Trade indifferently with either: but they have so great an aversion for the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
that they would never grant them a Toleration of their Religion in <hi>Muscovy.</hi> In
the year 1627. the late King of <hi>France</hi> proposed, by <hi>Louis des Hayes,</hi> a Treaty for the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Commerce with the <hi>French,</hi> and at the same time for a Church, where they might
have Mass said, but it was deny'd. And in the first War of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> they would not entertain
<hi>Catholick</hi> Souldiers. Nay, in the Treaty they made with us, for our passage into <hi>Persia,</hi> it
is an express Article, that we should not take any <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks into our retinue. So that
it is much to be admired, that they should call to the Crown <hi>Vladislaus,</hi> Prince of <hi>Poland</hi> and
<hi>Sueden;</hi> though that Election came to nothing, for reasons, into which it is beside the subject
of our Relation to enquire, as it is also into those which may be given of the Animosity of the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> against the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> whereof the grounds are to be searched for in <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical

                  <p>Our <hi>Muscovian</hi> Mariners, whom the Aquavitae they had taken had made more lively and
lusty than ordinary, took such pains in the mean time, being always eight a-rowing, that the
next morning at Sun-rising, we were got as far as a pleasant Country house, called <hi>Duoreni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou,</hi>
seated on the left side of the River, 80 <hi>Werstes,</hi> which make 16 <hi>German</hi> leagues, from
<hi>Simana.</hi> At night, we got 40 <hi>werstes,</hi> or 8 <hi>German</hi> leagues, from <hi>Duoreninou,</hi> to a Village
called <hi>Mortschuck;</hi> so that in 24 hours, we made so many <hi>German</hi> leagues.</p>
                  <p>The next day, <hi>Iuly</hi> 2. about noon, near the Village and Monastery of <hi>Porsenis,</hi> we met with
several great Boats, loaden with Honey, Salt, and Salt-fish, coming, most of them, from
<hi>Astrachan,</hi> bound for <hi>Moscou.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At night,<note place="margin">Columna.</note> we were come before the City of <hi>Columna.</hi> It lies on the right side of the River
<hi>Mosca, 180 werstes,</hi> or 36 <hi>German</hi> leagues from <hi>Moscou,</hi> though by Land there is but 18.
which may be travell'd in a short time, especially in the Winter, upon the snow. The City is
of a considerable bigness, and looks very delightful on the out-side, by reason of its Towers
and stone-walls, which are not ordinary in <hi>Muscovy.</hi> Nay it is indeed of that accompt, that
the Great Duke hath his <hi>Weywode</hi> there, which is not seen but in the chief Cities of Provinces.
We sent him our Pass-port, by the <hi>Pristaf,</hi> and immediately the wooden Bridge was full of
people; and whereas the covering of our Boat was too high to pass under the Bridge, they in a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47786:74"/>
trice took off one of the Arches, to make us way. We said in the fore-going Book, that there
is but one Bishop in all <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and that his Residence is in this City of <hi>Columna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three <hi>werstes</hi> above the City, near the Convent of <hi>Kolutin Serge Monastir,</hi> founded by one
<hi>Sergius,</hi> a Saint among them, whom we have spoken of elsewhere, and who is buried at the
Monastery of <hi>Troitza,</hi> the <hi>Mosca</hi> falls into the River <hi>Occa,</hi> which is incomparably much more
delightful, and broader than the other. It comes from-wards the South, and hath on both sides
it a noble Country, well peopled, and very fruitful. Both shores are well furnish'd with Oaks,
which is a kind of rarity in those parts. Being got ashore, we had a Sermon under a great Tree,
which sufficiently shaded the whole Assembly.</p>
                  <p>Presently after Dinner we embark'd, and left, about half a league on the left hand, a great
Island in the midst of the River. Afterwards, we pass'd by several Villages, namely those of
<hi>Scelsa</hi> and <hi>Moroso,</hi> which are bigger than any of the rest, and both upon the River side, on
the right hand.</p>
                  <p>The 4. about noon,<note place="margin">Peresla.</note> we got to the City of <hi>Peresla</hi> seated upon the River side, upon the right
hand, 22. leagues and a half from <hi>Columna,</hi> at 54. degrees, 42. minutes, elevation. This hath
also its particular <hi>Weywode.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 5. we left on our right hand the Town of <hi>Rhesan.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rhesan.</note> It was heretofore a gallant City, and
had given its name to the whole Province, but the <hi>Crim-Tartars</hi> destroy'd it, with the whole
Dutchy, in the year 1568. The Great Duke, considering the fertility of the Country, which
reaches from the River <hi>Occa,</hi> as far as the Trench made against the irruption of the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
got together, such of the Inhabitants as the invasion of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> had dispers'd, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
caused Materials to be brought to a place eight leagues from it, he ordered the building of a
City there, which, to this day, is called <hi>Peresla Resanski,</hi> because there went thither many of
the Inhabitants of <hi>Peresla,</hi> which stands at an equal distance from <hi>Moscou</hi> North-wards, with
this South-wards. The Town of <hi>Rhesan</hi> still keeps the honour of having the Residence of the
Archibishop: but we are to correct their errour, who affirm, that the Province of <hi>Rhesan</hi> lies
West-ward from <hi>Moscou,</hi> since they themselves confess it is between the Rivers of <hi>Don</hi> and
<hi>Occa,</hi> which are not towards the West from <hi>Moscou,</hi> but towards the East: so that <hi>Rhesan</hi>
must be placed in the Map, South-ward from the City of <hi>Moscou.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same day, we pass'd in sight of several Monasteries, and Villages; as that of <hi>Seloy,</hi> neer
<hi>Rhesan,</hi> on the left hand; and 7. <hi>werstes</hi> thence, <hi>Kystrus,</hi> as also, on the other side, &amp; 3. <hi>werstes</hi> thence,
the Monastery of <hi>Oblozitza;</hi> and 2. <hi>werstes</hi> thence, <hi>Lippono-Issado;</hi> at 2. thence, <hi>Muratou;</hi> at 1. thence,
<hi>Kallionino;</hi> and 2. thence, <hi>Schilko.</hi> Near the first Village we found a Carkass floating on the
water, which, in all likelihood, the <hi>Cosaques</hi> had cast into the River many dayes before, in as
much as it was so Sun-burnt, that it was become black. In the afternoon, we got four leagues.</p>
                  <p>The 6. we made two, as far as the Monastery of <hi>Tericho,</hi> on the left hand; thence two more,
to <hi>Tinersko Slowoda,</hi> on the right hand; and afterwards 8. <hi>werstes,</hi> to <hi>Swintzus;</hi> and thence
2. <hi>werstes,</hi> to <hi>Kopanowo,</hi> where we found another dead Carcass: But the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive
Slaves, who retire into those parts, do there commit so many Villanies, that the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
to whom those accidents are ordinary, thought it nothing strange.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iuly</hi> 7. betimes in the morning, we left on the right hand, an Island, called <hi>Dobrinin
Ostrow, 30. werstes,</hi> or 6. leagues from the last Village; and afterwards <hi>Seloy Rubets,</hi> at 7.
<hi>werstes</hi> thence; and, at 7. more thence, on the same side, <hi>Kurman.</hi> About 6. <hi>werstes</hi> thence,
we had on the left hand, the River <hi>Gusreca,</hi> and several other Villages, and on the right hand
<hi>Molcowa,</hi> at 8. <hi>werstes, Gabiloska,</hi> at two, and <hi>Babino,</hi> at three. Thence we made three <hi>werstes,</hi>
and came at night to <hi>Cassinogorod.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cassinogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorod.</note> This City lies on the right side of the River <hi>Occa,</hi> in the
Principality of <hi>Cassinou</hi> in <hi>Tartary,</hi> and there it was we first met with any <hi>Mahometans.</hi> Not
far from the City, in an old stone Castle, which had sometime been a Fort, lived a young
Prince of that Country, whose name was <hi>Res Ketzi,</hi> with his Mother and Grand-father, who
some years before had put himself into the protection of the Great Duke of <hi>Muscovy</hi> We were
told, that the Great Duke, would have press'd him to receive Baptism, upon some hopes given
him that he should have married his Daughter, but the young Prince, who was but 12. years
of age, sent him word, that being not come to years, so as to make choice of any Religion, he
could not take a resolution of that importance. The Ambassadors sent two Gentlemen of their
retinue to give him a visit, and presented him with a pound of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and a bottle of Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae.
He took it very kindly, and made it his excuse, that he could not entertain the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
at his house, left the neighbouring <hi>Weywodes</hi> should conceive any jealousy at his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Strangers, without their permission. He therefore only sent some of his Servants to
us, whom our Interpreter could hardly make a shift to understand, they being all <hi>Tartars.</hi> He
sent us a present of two sheep, a Barrel of Hydromel, another of Beer, and a third of Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae,
with some pieces of Ice, Cream and fresh Butter, which the Prince's mother had her self
taken the pains to beat.</p>
                  <p>The night following, and the next day, being the 9. we saw, as we pass'd several Villages,
Monasteries and Taverns, most of them very pleasantly seated, amidst the woods; among others,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47786:74"/>
on the right hand <hi>Potsink Tartasko,</hi> three <hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Cassinogorod,</hi> and at seven <hi>werstes</hi> thence,
<hi>Seloy Pettiowo,</hi> Then a Tavern, or <hi>Caback,</hi> at eight <hi>werstes,</hi> and <hi>Brooth,</hi> at five <hi>werstes</hi> one
from another, upon the left hand: and then on the right hand, the River of <hi>Moksche,</hi> at eight
<hi>werstes;</hi> then on the left hand, another Tavern; at two <hi>werstes</hi> thence, <hi>Sateowa;</hi> at 13 <hi>werstes,</hi>
the Monastery of <hi>Adrianou Pustino;</hi> at 13 more <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

about 300 houses, and belongs to the Bojar, <hi>Foedor Iuanouits Sheremetou.</hi> And thence we
got 20 <hi>werstes</hi> to the Forest of <hi>Rusbonor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 9. we got ten <hi>werstes,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Worskressenia,</hi> commonly called <hi>Woskressenski<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mehl,</hi>
upon the left hand; and thence five <hi>werstes,</hi> to a great Village named <hi>Lechi,</hi> belonging
to <hi>Knez Boris Michaelouits Lycou,</hi> on the same side; and thence about ten <hi>werstes,</hi> to
<hi>Pretziste Resenskou,</hi> on the right hand; and at last to the City of <hi>Moruma,</hi> on the
left hand.</p>
                  <p>Before we got to the City,<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Moruma.</hi>
                     </note> we discover'd on the other side of the River a company of <hi>Crim
Tartars,</hi> who presently got into the woods, whence they discharg'd their Fowling pieces at us,
which we answer'd with Muskers, and so forc'd them to keep off. They were seen afterwards
below the City, whence we imagin'd, they would have set upon us the night following;
whereupon we lay under the Isle of of <hi>Zuchtsko Ostrou,</hi> and set a strong Guard; but we heard
no more of them.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Moruma,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars <hi>of</hi> Mordwa.</note> is the chiefest of the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Mordwa,</hi> and is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by <hi>Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> but subject to the Great Duke. VVe sent our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
to the Market to buy some provisions necessary, for the continuation of our
Voyage.</p>
                  <p>The 10. we passed by the Town of <hi>Prewospalo,</hi> belonging to <hi>Knez Iuan Borissowits Circaski,</hi>
one of the Great Dukes Privy Councel, and left, on both hands, several little Villages, and
the River of <hi>Morsna Reka,</hi> on the right hand; and at eight <hi>werstes</hi> thence that of <hi>Clesna,</hi> which
comes from <hi>Wladimer.</hi> All along from that place, the shore on the right hand rises by little and
little, to such an extraordinary height, that looking on it from the water, it seems to be one
continued mountain, for above a hundred <hi>German</hi> leagues along the River <hi>Wolga.</hi> Insomuch,
that even in that season, as also in the greatest heat of Summer, those parts are not without Ice
and Snow, though all elsewhere, the Country is plain, fertile and fit for Tillage, reaching
above a hundred leagues towards the South-west, and on the other side, it lies very low, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
and moorish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iuly</hi> 11. having pass'd by the pleasant Villages of <hi>Isbuilets, Troitska, Slowoda,</hi> the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of <hi>Dudina,</hi> and <hi>Nofimki,</hi> we got at night before the great and Noble City of <hi>Nise,</hi> or
<hi>Nisenovogorod,</hi> where we found the ship, called the <hi>Frederick,</hi> which we had ordered to be
built, by our Captain <hi>Michael Cordes,</hi> whereof we spoke in the beginning of our Relation. It
was not quite finish'd, by reason the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Carpenters, whom the Captain had employ'd
about her, had not answer'd his expectation; yet was it so far on, that the Ambassadors lodg'd
in it, and so forbore going into the City. It was built of Deal, being 120 foot long, and 40
broad, having three Masts, and so flat-bottom'd, that it took but seven foot water. It had
many Chambers and Closets, for the convenience of the Ambassadors, the Officers and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of their Retinue, and some Iron and Brass Guns, a great number of Granadoes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fire-arms. And as our design was to make use of it chiefly upon the <hi>Wolga,</hi> which is full
of Banks and quick-sands, it was so built, as that if there were no wind, they might use Oars;
and to that end, it had twelve seats, two Oars to every seat. We had caused to be made a
double Shallop, for the conveniency of unlading the Ship in those places where it might want
water, as also to carry the Anchors, Cables, Sails, and other things necessary for so great
a Voyage, and to discover those Banks and Sands in the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, which might hinder or
retard its passage.</p>
                  <p>We stayd almost three weeks before the City of <hi>Nisenovogorod,</hi> for the finishing of the Ship,
which time we spent in visiting our Friends in the City, where the chiefest <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants
entertain'd us at several great Feasts, as also in reciprocally treating them in our Tent, which
we had pitch'd by the River side.</p>
                  <p>Our stay there gave me the convenience to observe the elevation of that place,<note place="margin">Nisenovo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorod.</note> which I found,
at the place where the River <hi>Occa</hi> falls into the <hi>Wolga,</hi> to be at 56 degrees, 28 minutes, and
that the Needle of the Compass declined there above nine degrees, towards the West. The
Great Duke <hi>Basili</hi> ordered it to be built at the conflux or meeting of those two Noble Rivers,
and gave it the name of <hi>Nisenovogorod,</hi> upon occasion of the Inhabitants of the great City of
<hi>Novogorod,</hi> whom he caused to be translated thither. This indeed is not so great as the other,
yet hath its Towers and Walls of stone. From <hi>Moscou</hi> to <hi>Nise</hi> are accounted 500 <hi>werstes,</hi> or
100 <hi>German</hi> leagues by Land; but by water, it is above 150. The Suburbs are much bigger
than the City, and are above half a league about. The Inhabitants are <hi>Tartars, Muscovites,</hi>
and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> of whom there are so many as make a <hi>Protestant</hi> Church of about 100. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
<hi>Iohn Bernarts,</hi> our Factor, was the chiefest man among them, the rest being, for the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47786:75"/>
most part, Military Officers, Merchants, and Victuallers, or Sutlers. The City is Governed
by a <hi>Weywode,</hi> who, at our passage that way, was <hi>Basili Petrouits,</hi> under the Great Duke-Provisions were so cheap there, that we bought a Pullet for a penny, a quartern of Eggs for as
much, and a Mutton, for 12. 15. or, at most, for 18. pence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iuly</hi> 24. The Ambassadors sent Monsieur <hi>Mandelslo</hi> and my self, accompany'd by our <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi>
Interpreter and the <hi>Pristaf,</hi> to the <hi>Weywode,</hi> to thank him for his civilities towards our
people, during the stay they had made in the City, while the Ship was a building, which was
almost a year, and to make him a Present of a Jewel worth a hundred Crowns. His reception
of us discover'd how magnificently he liv'd, and what a noble house he kept. For as soon as
notice was brought him that we were come near the house, he sent two very handsom compleat
persons to meet us at the Gate. They conducted us through a very long Gallery, and at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Palace it self, we met with two comely old men, richly clad, who brought us to
the <hi>Weywode</hi>'s Chamber, who had on a Garment of Brocadoe, and was accompany'd by a great
number of persons of Quality. The Room was hung with <hi>Turkie</hi> Tapistry, and had in it a
great Cup-board of Plate. He receiv'd us with much civility, and having accepted the Present,
and answer'd our Complement, he desir'd us to take our part of a Collation, during which, his
Discourse was excellent good, and such as we thought the more extraordinary, in that the
<hi>Muscovites,</hi> for the most part, contribute very little to any thing of Conversation. Among
other things he asked us whether we did not fear meeting with the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> who in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
would set upon us ere we got off the <hi>Wolga,</hi> and told us, they were a barbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
people, and more cruel than Lions, shewing us at the same time a Picture, wherein was
represented <hi>Sampson</hi>'s engagement with one of those Creatures. We made him answer, that
we look'd on that Piece as a good omen, in as much as if the <hi>Cosaques</hi> were stout as Lions, we
should behave our selves, on the other-side, like <hi>Sampsons.</hi> The <hi>Weywode</hi> reply'd, that he had
that good opinion of us, nay-believ'd, that the repute our Nation had gain'd, by the services it
had done his <hi>Czaarick</hi> Majesty, would frighten the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> and hinder them from attempting
ought against us.</p>
                  <p>The River <hi>Wolga</hi> is four thousand six hundred Geometrical feet wide near <hi>Nise,</hi> at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the two Rivers; and whereas its waters encrease in the months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Iune,</hi> by
reason of the Sun's having melted the Snow, and thaw'd the Rivers which fall into it, the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who go from <hi>Moscou</hi> to <hi>Astrachan,</hi> do commonly take that time, when there is water
enough to pass over the Banks of Sand, nay indeed the little Islands which are very frequent in
that River. This consideration, and the example of their misfortune, whose Boats we had seen
cast away, and half rotten upon the Sands, made us resolve upon our departure thence with the
soonest, before the waters, which visibly decreas'd, were fallen too low, and so we appointed
it should be the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Wolga,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Wolga.</note> whereof we gave a short accompt in the precedent book, is, in my opinion, one
of the noblest and greatest Rivers in the World, its course being of a vast extent, from its source
to the place where it falls into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, below <hi>Astrachan.</hi> Whence it came that I took
a delight to observe all the particularities thereof, from League to League, and from <hi>Werste</hi> to
<hi>Werste,</hi> with all possible exactness, and with the assistance of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Master's-mate, named
<hi>Cornelius Nicholas,</hi> one of the most able I ever came acquainted with in that Science, as also of
some <hi>Muscovian</hi> Pilots, I have drawn a very exact Map of it, which I had made the World a
promise of some years since, but now part with it, so well done, that I hope the Judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will be satisfy'd therewith.</p>
                  <p>Having bought Provisions for our Voyage as far as <hi>Astrachan,</hi> we left <hi>Nise</hi> the day before
named, having only a side wind. Mr. <hi>Balthasar Moucheron,</hi> Commissary, or Agent from his
Highness of <hi>Holstein</hi> about the Great Duke, the <hi>Weywode</hi> of <hi>Nise</hi>'s Secretary, the Pastor of the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> Church there, and our Factor, <hi>Iohn Bernarts,</hi> would needs accompany us some
<hi>Werstes,</hi> to see the beginning of that long Voyage: but we had hardly got two <hi>Werstes,</hi> ere we
were a ground near the Monastery of <hi>Petsora,</hi> and forc'd to cast Anchor, while the men were
getting off the ship, which took them up four hours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iuly</hi> 31. Having made about a <hi>Werste,</hi> the Ship touch'd against a Sand-bank, but was soon
got off, and we had continu'd our course, if the contrary wind, together with a Tempest, had
not oblig'd us to cast Anchor. This interval we spent in our Devotions, to give God thanks for
his miraculous deliverance of us the year before, when we were wrack'd upon the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea.
Having entertain'd our friends with a Dinner and Musick, they took leave of us, and return'd
that night to <hi>Nise.</hi>

struck again upon the Sand. Most of our Gentlemen went ashore, and had good fowling; for
the High-Country between <hi>Nise</hi> and <hi>Cassan</hi> being well furnish'd with Wood and Pastures, was
also well supply'd with fowl.</p>
                  <p>The 2. The wind being somewhat lay'd, we weigh'd Anchor, for the prosecution of our
Voyage: but ere we had gotten a quarter of a League, we met again with Sand-banks near the
Isle of <hi>Tletinski,</hi> and soon after others, near the Isle of <hi>Subsinski,</hi> where we saw a great Boat
which had not long before been cast away thereabouts. These unfortunate accidents, our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nine hours getting off this last Bank, together with the ignorance of our Pilot, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
he had not made that Voyage in eight years before, much abated their courage, who,
considering that in four days they had made but two Leagues, and that there were 550. to make,
ere they came to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, began to doubt they should never go through that Voyage.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>3d.</hi> We advanc'd a little better, and pass'd by the Villages of <hi>Stolbiza</hi> and <hi>Stoba,</hi>
which lye three leagues from <hi>Nise.</hi> We saw afterwards, on the right hand, in a bottom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Mountains, the Village of <hi>Welikofrat,</hi> that of <hi>Tsimonski,</hi> upon a Hill, and the Isle
of <hi>Diploi</hi> at twenty <hi>Werstes,</hi> or four leagues from <hi>Nise.</hi> Near this Village we met with a great
Vessel that had 200 men in it. It came from <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and was loaden with salt fish. They
cannot be without such a great number of Mariners, by reason that, instead of Laveering or
Rowing, when the wind is against them, they cast Anchor a quarter of a League before them,
and all those men pull the Cable to which it is fasten'd, and so they advance by little and little,
with much expence of time and pains, making but two Leagues a day at most, by reason of the
greatness of those Boats, which are of 800. 900. or 1000. Tuns burthen. In the afternoon we
left several Villages on the right hand, as <hi>Beswodna, Kasnitza,</hi> where I found the elevation to
be 56d. 21 m. <hi>Rubotka, Tzetschina, Targinits,</hi> and <hi>Iurkin,</hi> where we pass'd between two
Islands at 21 foot water. This last Village is ten Leagues from <hi>Nise.</hi> At night, the wind being
more fair for us, we made use of our Sayls. The next day, the wind still good, we pass'd by
several little Villages, leaving on the right hand the Towns of <hi>Masa</hi> and <hi>Cremonski,</hi> near which
we lay at Anchor, the fourth all night, because, the River being shallow thereabouts, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
running upon the Sand-banks in the dark.</p>

that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have extended their Territories much farther, they think it unnecessary to
keep any Garrison there.</p>
                  <p>The 6th. We had much ado to pass the Sands, which we met with every foot, so that it
was afternoon ere we came up to the City, which we saluted with a volley of our great Guns.
That honour we did all the Cities upon the same River.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> we spoke of are called <hi>Ceremisses,</hi>

both sides of the River <hi>Wolga.</hi> They have no Houses, but only wretched Huts, and live upon
Honey, and the wild-fowl they take in the Woods, and Milk, which their Pastures furnish
them with. 'Tis a Nation absolutely barbarous, treacherous, and cruel, much given to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery
and robbery. Those who live on the right side of the <hi>Wolga</hi> are called <hi>Nagorni,</hi> or Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineers,
from the word <hi>na,</hi> which, in the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Language, signifies, upon, and <hi>Gor,</hi> a
Mountain: and those on the left <hi>Lugoivi</hi> or <hi>Lugowizene,</hi> that is to say, Meadows, because of
the abundance of Hay which those parts afford, insomuch that the <hi>Nagorni</hi> are supply'd thence.
<hi>Guagnin</hi> says, they are partly <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> partly <hi>Heathens;</hi> but this I am certain of, that
about <hi>Casan</hi> they are all <hi>Heathens;</hi> not knowing what either Circumcision or Baptism means.
All the Ceremony they have when they are to give a Child a name, consists in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some day six moneths after, on which they give it the name of that person whom they
first meet.</p>
                  <p>Most of them believe there is a God, who is immortal, author of all the good that happens
to men, and that he ought to be adored. But this is all they know of him; For they do not
believe the immortality of the Soul, nor consequently the Resurrection of the dead: but that
men and beasts have the same beginning, and come to the same end. I met with one of the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remisses</hi>
at a house where I lodg'd at <hi>Casan.</hi> He was aged about 45 years, and wanted not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
but understanding that I was discoursing with my Host about some points of
Religion, and that I spoke of the Resurrection of the Dead, he laugh'd at the perswasion,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47786:85"/>
and said to me, Those who are dead are really dead, and will never return again, no more than
my Horses and Cows, which are long since rotten. I asked him whether he knew who Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this World, and made Heaven and Earth? his answer was, <hi>Tzortsneit,</hi> The Devil may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know. They do not believe there is any Hell, yet are perswaded there are Devils, and evil
Spirits, which afflict and torment people in this life; and therefore they endeavour to appease
them, and to gain their favour by Sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Forty Leagues from <hi>Casan</hi> there is a place called <hi>Nemda,</hi> amidst the Fenns, where these
<hi>Tartars</hi> go Pilgrimages and do their Devotions; and they believe that those who go thither
empty-handed, and carry no Present to the Devil, shall languish and pine away of some long
and incurable disease. A particular point of their faith, is, that the Devil hath his principal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
in the Torrent of <hi>Schockschem,</hi> ten <hi>Werstes</hi> from <hi>Nunda;</hi> and whereas that little ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet,
which is but four foot deep, is never frozen (occasion'd by the violence of its course
between two Mountains) they think it is not without some mystery, and they have so great a
veneration for it, as to be perswaded, they cannot come near it, without danger of their lives,
though the <hi>Muscovites</hi> cross it dayly without any.</p>
                  <p>In their Sacrifices to God, they kill a Horse, an Ox, or a Sheep, roasting the flesh, and take
a cut thereof in a Dish, and holding in the other hand another Dish full of Hydromel, or some
other liquor, they cast both into a fire, which they make before the skin of the Creature that
is sacrificed, which skin they hang upon a Pole laid a-cross between two Trees. They intreat
that skin to present their Prayers to God, or sometimes they make their address immediately to
God, and pray him to augment the number of their Cattel, or grant them some other conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of this life, which are the only object of all their Devotions. They adore also the Sun
and Moon, as Authors of all the Noble Productions of the Earth; nay they are so fondly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
as to have a veneration for what ever presents it self to them in the night in their
Dreams, and to adore it the next day, as a Horse, a Cow, Fire, Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I told the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
I spoke of before, that it was madness, to worship those Creatures, whose lives are at our
disposal; He reply'd, that it was better to adore things Animate, than the Gods of Wood and
Colours which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> have hanging on their Walls. They have neither Churches,
nor Priests, nor Books, and the Language of the <hi>Ceremisses</hi> is peculiar to them, having in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
nothing common with that of the other <hi>Tartars,</hi> nor yet with the <hi>Turkish;</hi> though those
who are subject to the <hi>Czaar,</hi> and so oblig'd to converse with the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> make use also of
their Language.</p>
                  <p>They perform all Religious Ceremonies and Sacrifices near some Torrent, where they meet
together, especially when upon the death of any of their friends, who hath left any Wealth
behind him, they make good Cheer with the best Horse he had, which they put to death with
the Master.</p>
                  <p>Polygamy is so ordinary among them, that there are few but have four or five Wives, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they take two or three into the same house, and make no great difficulty to marry two or
three Sisters at the same time. Their Women and young Maids are all clad in a coarse white
Cloath, wherein they so wrap up themselves, that there is nothing to be seen but their Faces.
Those that are betroathed have a particular dress for their Heads, which hath a point like a
Horn, which seems to come out of the Head, about half an ell in length: At the end of that
Horn, there is a Tassel of silk, of diverse colours, at which hangs a little Bell. The Men wear
a long Coat or Garment of coarse Linnen Cloath, under which they wear Breeches. They all
shave their Heads, only those young Men that are not married, leave on the Head a long tress of
Hair, which some tye up into a knot upon the Head, others suffer to hang down the Back:
which particularity we had the opportunity to take better notice of at our return at <hi>Casan.</hi>
When they saw us upon the River in a Dress so different from theirs, they were affrighted, so
as that some fled, others had the confidence to stay on the Rivers side, but not one would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to come into the Ship. Being come at night to the River of <hi>Welluka,</hi> near the Monastery
of <hi>Iunka,</hi> one of these <hi>Tartars</hi> had the courage to bring us a Sturgeon to sell, for which, at first,
he asked a Crown, but afterwards let it go for <hi>xv d.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>August</hi> 7. we came before the City of <hi>Kusmademiansky, 40. werstes</hi> from <hi>Basiligorod,</hi> seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the foot of a mountain on the right hand. We saw, in those parts, whole Forests of
Elms, the Bark whereof they sell all over the Country to make Sledges of. The Trees are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times of such compass, that the body of them being cut cylinder-wise, they make great Fats,
Barrels, and Coffins thereof, all of one piece, which they sell at the adjacent Towns.</p>
                  <p>We cast Anchor three <hi>werstes</hi> thence near the Island of <hi>Krius,</hi> where we did our Devotions,
and Celebrated the Lords Supper. The Peasants thereabouts, brought aboard the Ship several
provisions to sell. About a league thence a tempest overtook us, and forc'd us to cast Anchor
and to stay there all night.</p>
                  <p>The 8. the wind fair, we got, about noon, near the Island of <hi>Turich;</hi> but in the afternoon,
the same wind forc'd our Ship, being under all the Sail she could make, upon a Sand-bank, near
the Island of <hi>Maslof,</hi> with such violence, that it was thought the Masts would have broken;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47786:85"/>
and this prov'd such a check to us, that it cost us four hours toil and trouble to get off. We
perceiv'd on the right hand a great number of <hi>Tartars,</hi> some a-foot, some on horse-back, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Hay-making. We came at night before the City of <hi>Sabakzar, 40. werstes</hi> from <hi>Kus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mademianski,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The City of <hi>Sabakzar.</hi>
                     </note>
and upon the same side of the River. The buildings of this City are of Wood, as
are those of all the rest, but the situation of this is, beyond comparison, more pleasant than
that of any other City of <hi>Tartary.</hi> The Inhabitants perceiving our Ship at some distance, knew
not at first what to think of her; whence it came that the <hi>Weywode</hi> sent some Musketiers in a
Boat, as far as the Island of <hi>Makrits,</hi> three <hi>werstes</hi> from the City, to discover what we were.
The Boat thinking it not safe to venture too near us, took a compass, at a great distance about
our Ship, and so returned to the City. But they no sooner understood our quality by our Pass-port,
and withall the occasion of our Voyage, but there came above 300. persons to the River side to
see us pass by.</p>
                  <p>The 9. we pass'd by the Island of <hi>Cosin,</hi> leaving it on the left hand, 12. <hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Sabak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar.</hi>
Afterwards on the same hand a Village, named <hi>Sundir,</hi> and thence we came to a little Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
called <hi>Kockschaga,</hi> on the left side of the <hi>Wolga, 25. werstes</hi> from <hi>Sabakzar.</hi> The River is so
shallow thereabouts, that there was hardly water enough for our Ship, which put us to much
trouble, both that day and the next.</p>
                  <p>The 11. the current having forc'd the Ship upon the shore, where we were constrain'd to stay
for several hours, M. <hi>Mandelslo</hi> and my self went a shore, to divert our selves and see what
Fruits we could find in the Woods. Which had like to have occasion'd us a great misfortune,
for the wind turning fair, at our return to the River side, all were gone, the Ship it self not in
sight, though we made all the hast we could to overtake it. At last we saw a Boat coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, which we thought at first might belong to the <hi>Cosaques;</hi> but soon after we perceiv'd
they were some of our own, sent to bring us aboard. The conrtary wind had stay'd the Ship at
a turning of the River, and the tempest still increasing, we were forc'd to cast anchor, and to lie
there all night.</p>
                  <p>The 12. we spent in getting beyond the turning by the help of an Anchor which we order'd
to be cast at some distance before us, but with this misfortune, that having fasten'd in a Tree
that was in the bottom, the Cable broke ere it could be had up again. The River is very full of
those Trees, which it brings down with it when it overflows; and these accidents happen so
frequently, that the bottom of the River is so lay'd with Anchors, that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> say,
there are as many as would purchase a Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The 13. before noon, we saw, as we pass'd, two <hi>Cabaques,</hi> or Taverns, and a Village na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

on the ascent of a hill, on the left hand, having a Castle and some Churches built of stone: but
all the other buildings, as also the Towers and Rampiers of the City, are of wood. We cast
Anchor there, by reason of a Sand-bank which we were to pass by. The people in the mean
time came in multitudes to the River side to see us, and by reason that a little sandy Hill hindred
their having a full sight of us, many came in Boats to the Ship side, others swam over to the
Hill. Having pass'd by certain white Mountains, whereof some were of Chalk, others of Sand,
we came at night before the City of <hi>Casan,</hi>

                  <p>The City of <hi>Casan</hi> is seated in a plain, 7. <hi>werstes</hi> from the <hi>Wolga,</hi> upon the River <hi>Casanka,</hi>
which gives it the name, as it does to the whole Province. I found the elevation there to be 55.
degrees, 38. minutes. It is of a considerable bigness, but all its Houses, as also the Towers and
Rampiers, are of wood. Only the Castle and its Fortifications are of stone, being well moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

makes it a very considerable fortress. The Castle hath its <hi>VVeywode,</hi> and the City, its Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

Presents from those who kept the Castle, who maintain'd it with more courage than
success, they made a Peace, whereof this was one Article, That the Great Duke and all his
Subjects, should ever after be Tributaries to them. <hi>Basili</hi> was loath to submit to such disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Terms, but forc'd to comply with necessity, he accepted them, and confirmed the

express his affection to her by beating her with a Bull's pizzle. This man did the <hi>Weywode</hi> very
great services, and kill'd so many <hi>Tartars,</hi> that <hi>Mendligeri</hi> perceiving one day, that a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-bullet
had taken off a piece of his Garment, was frighted, and proffered to raise the Siege,
upon condition they would return the Great Duke's Letters. But the <hi>Weywode</hi> would hearken
to no such thing, and having oblig'd <hi>Mendligeri</hi> to retreat, he sent the Letters to his Prince's
Court, where they were received with the general joy of all the people, who immediately
thereupon pull'd down, and broke to pieces the Statue of <hi>Mendliger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> Nay the Great Duke
himself took such courage from that Action, that having rais'd an Army of 25000 men, he
proclaim'd open War against <hi>Sapgeri,</hi> Prince of <hi>Casan,</hi> sending him word, that he, by surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and assaulting him without declaring any War, had proceeded like a Murtherer and a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
but that himself, as Soveraign Lord and Conservator of all the <hi>Russes,</hi> proceeded therein
as a person of Honour should do, and sent him word, that his Army was upon the march, in
order to the besieging of <hi>Casan.</hi> This Siege caus'd the loss of much blood on both sides, but
prov'd unfortunate to the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who were at last forc'd to raise it. Thus ended the War
between the Great Duke <hi>Basili Iuanouits</hi> and the <hi>Tartars.</hi>

<hi>Muscovites</hi> had receiv'd before <hi>Casan,</hi> began his Reign with the Siege of that place. Having
batter'd it for the space of two moneths together, fearing that <hi>Mendligeri</hi> would come in with
his <hi>Crim-Tartars</hi> to the relief of his Brother, and exasperated at the refusal which the besieged had
made, to accept of very honourable conditions, he commanded all the Walls to be undermined,
and a general assault to be given.<note place="margin">And takes it by storm.</note> The Mines wrought their effect, and took off great numbers
of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> the Assault was given, and the place carry'd by storm, on the 9 of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1552.
The <hi>Tartars</hi> perceiving the enemies were gotten into the place, took this resolution after they
had made a vigorous resistance in two several places within the City, where they fortify'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and seeing their chiefest Commanders kill'd or wounded, they went out at one of the
Gates, made their way through the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> and got on the other side of the River <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanska</hi>
Ever since, the City and Province of <hi>Casan</hi> hath continued under the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> who
repair'd the breaches, renew'd the Fortifications, and reduc'd the Castle to the condition it is
now in, having four Bastions, of stone, many Towers, and a good Ditch.</p>
                  <p>He who had the command of this place, when we pass'd that way, was Brother to the <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode</hi>

a very Noble Ruby. M. <hi>Mandelslo</hi> and I, conceiving our Ship would have lain there at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
all that day and the next,<note place="margin">Melons of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> went ashore, as well to take the situation of the City, as to
buy certain provisions. We could meet with nothing but Fruits, among others, particularly
Melons, full as big as our Pompions, and Salt-fish, but such as stunk so that we were forc'd
to stop our Noses, to shun the infection. As we came out of the City, we met with divers
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47786:86"/>
                     <hi>Tartars,</hi> who told us that our Ship was gone; which intelligence oblig'd us to take a
VVagon, and afterwards, to make use of the <hi>Pristaf</hi>'s Boat to bring us aboard, which,
in the evening we found at Anchor, two leagues below <hi>Casan,</hi> where they intended to lye all
that night.</p>

                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 15. We continu'd our course, with the current of the water, which being very strong
in that place by reason of the narrowness of the River, brought us that day as far as the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of <hi>Klitsischa, 26. werstes</hi> from <hi>Casan,</hi> lying amidst several Sand-banks, which we had
much ado to pass through. Some part of that day, as also of the next, we spent in recovering
our Anchors, whereof the Cables were broken; we at last made a shift to get up the great one,
and left the little one behind, as being loath to lose any more time. Thence, we pass'd by a
Tavern called <hi>Kabak Tenkofski, 30. werstes</hi> from <hi>Casan,</hi> where we met with great Sand-banks;
and about half a League beyond it, another Bank, near a Tavern called <hi>Keshofska,</hi> which we
had much difficulty to pass.</p>
                  <p>The 17. We pass'd over a great Bank, which had given the name to the Tavern we had
pass'd by the day before. Thence we came to a place, where the shore on one side was very
high, and some part of it fallen into the River about a moneth before, and by its fall had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd
a Boat full of people, who were going that way to gather Cherries, whereof there is
abundance in those parts. The new Pilot, whom we had taken up at <hi>Casan,</hi> told us, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <note place="margin">Ice in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</hi>
                     </note> he had met several of those Carkasses floating down the River, towards
the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. Hereabouts, near the shore, on the right hand, we met with great quantities
of Ice, which we put into our drinks, to make them drink the cooler.</p>
                  <p>In the evening we came to a place where the great River of <hi>Kama</hi> falls into the <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The River <hi>Kama.</hi>
                     </note> It
comes from North-East, out of the Province of <hi>Permie,</hi> and falls into the <hi>Wolga,</hi> on our left
hand, 60. <hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Casan.</hi> The water of it is blackish, and it is much about the same breadth
as that of <hi>Weser</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> At the mouth of it there are two Islands, whereof the greater is
called <hi>Sokol;</hi> and upon the Continent, over against it, a handsom Village called <hi>Pagantzina,</hi> and
three <hi>werstes</hi> thence, another, named <hi>Corotai,</hi> whence we got seven <hi>werstes</hi> further, as far as a
Village named <hi>Kirieska,</hi> where we stay'd all night.</p>
                  <p>The 18. The wind was so fair for us, that we made all the Sail we could, and got, by noon,
to the place where the River <hi>Zerdick</hi> falls into the <hi>Wolga,</hi> which is also on the left hand. It is
indeed but a branch of the River <hi>Kama,</hi> making a kind of an Island, and having another mouth
thirty <hi>werstes</hi> from the former. We discover'd at the same time on our right hand, upon a little
ascent,<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Tetus.</hi>
                     </note> the City of <hi>Tetus,</hi> distant from <hi>Casan 120. werstes,</hi> having its buildings, as well publick
as private, disorderly scatter'd up and down. From this place to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, there is no
Village at all.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon, near an Island called <hi>Proleikarsa,</hi> we met with the <hi>Weywode</hi> of <hi>Terki.</hi> This
City is seated upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea near <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and the <hi>Weywode,</hi> upon the expiration of
his three years Government, was then returning to <hi>Moscou,</hi> to make way for his Successor.
He was very well attended, having a Convoy of eight Boats with Musketiers in them. At first,
we knew not who they were, so that we kept them at a distance, by threatning to fire at them
if they came nearer. They told us there were three thousand <hi>Cosaques,</hi> who expected us at the
passage, some upon the River, some on the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; that they had seen not far thence,
upon the River-side, 70. horse, which the <hi>Tartars</hi> had drawn off to make a discovery of us, and
that they would be sure to set upon us; thinking with these stories to frighten us. We gave
them one great shot, and kept on our course, having the wind so fair, as that it carried us 70.
<hi>werstes</hi> that day.<note place="margin">The River of <hi>Utka.</hi>
                     </note> In the mean time, we left on our left hand the River <hi>Vtka,</hi> which rises near
the City of <hi>Bulgara, 25. werstes</hi> from <hi>Tetus.</hi> We thought fit, the night following, to make
tryal what our people could do, in case we should be set upon, so that the Ambassadors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it would not be amiss to have a false Alarum given, ordering the Sentinels to cry out,
and to discharge, and thereupon the Drums to beat, and the Musket and great Guns to be shot
off. Our men did their parts very well, and kept their stations, expressing much resolution.
We did the like in our return from <hi>Persia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 19. VVe came to the Island of <hi>Staritzo,</hi> which is 15. <hi>werstes</hi> long. There I found the
Elevation to be 54. d. 31. m. Behind that Island, on the right hand, we found a great number
of round stones, much after the form of Orenges or Citrons, which, being broken in the midst,
represented a Star of divers colours, whereof some had the resemblance of polish'd Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
others where brown or yellow. VVe took up a good quantity of them, to serve us for
bullets for our Murthering-Pieces. Thence we came to a very pleasant place, where might have
been seen heretofore a City of <hi>Tartary,</hi> called <hi>Vneroskora.</hi> There, had been buried one of their
Saints, for which Monument those that live thereabouts have still a great Devotion. From this
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47786:87"/>
place to the City of <hi>Tetus</hi> are accompted 65 <hi>werstes.</hi> We saw on the River-side, under certain
Trees, two men on hors-back, who immediately got out of the way, which occasion'd us to
send one to stand Sentinel in the Scuttle of the main Mast; but they appear'd no
more.</p>
                  <p>The 20. There came several Fisher-men of <hi>Tetus</hi> aboard us, and brought us 55 large breams,
which they had taken thereabouts, and sold them us for fifty pence. They have a particular
way of fishing. They fasten to the end of a long cord, a pretty big stone, which falls to the
bottom, and at the other end of the said cord several great pieces of Wood which swim upon
the water. All along this cord are fasten'd many little cords, each whereof hath a hook baited
with a certain kind of fish which is not of the least, but such as the others greedily feed upon.
The fish they take by this invention is ten or twelve foot long, the meat of it white, firm, and
very delicate. In our return from <hi>Persia,</hi> there was one brought to the Boat where I was with
the Ambassador <hi>Crusius,</hi> which was so big, though there was nothing else eaten, by reason e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one liked it so well, yet was all the company satisfied, and there was as much left as fill'd
a barrel, wherein it was pickled up.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Muscovites</hi> travel about their own occasions, they make use of another invention.
They fasten a hook to the end of a Cord, and tye the Cord about a piece of board of about the
breadth of a man's hand, plain'd very smooth, and tinn'd over; and drag it after the Boat, so
as that the current of the water causing it ever and anon to turn up towards the Sun, makes it
shine like the scales of fish: by which means drawing the greater sort of fish after it, they take
more than they can spend while they are on the water. So that the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> making no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
provision, for their journeys, but of bread twice bak'd or dried in the Oven, find it no hard
matter to subsist any where; not to mention, that their continual abstinences, and their Fasts
having accustom'd them to be content with little, and to care little for flesh, they make a shift
to live upon any thing they can meet withall; nay, in case of necessity, upon the liquor which
Nature furnishes them with.</p>
                  <p>At this place we let go the Boat which had carried our Provisions from <hi>Nise,</hi> which being
empty we had no further use for: but we thought fit to set it a fire, lest it might have fallen into
the hands of the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> who would have made use of it against us. About noon, we pass'd
by the Island of <hi>Botenska,</hi> which is three <hi>werstes</hi> in length, and is only divided by a small Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
from a kind of Cape, or Promontory, called <hi>Polibno.</hi> The contrary wind forc'd us to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
behind the Island, near the River <hi>Beitma,</hi> which, as they say, is also a branch of the great
River <hi>Kama.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 21. We left, on the right hand, two very pleasant places, which are reported
to have been heretofore great Cities, destroy'd by <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> whereof one was called <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berska-gora.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 22. With some little difficulty, we pass'd over three Sand Banks, whereof one is above,
the other, below the place whence may be seen the Mountain <hi>Arbeuchin,</hi> which was on our
right hand. It derives its name from a City, whereof the ruines are yet to be seen.</p>
                  <p>There may be seen from the River a great stone about 20 foot in length, and as many in
breadth, lying between two little Hills, having engraven on it the words following, <hi>Budesch
time dobro toboe budet;</hi> that is to say, <hi>If thou raise me, thou shalt be well rewarded.</hi> We were told,
that not long before, a great <hi>Muscovian</hi> Boat being forc'd by contrary winds to make some
stay there, fifty Passengers went ashore, to raise the stone; but when they had with much ado
turned it, they only found engraven on the other side these words, <hi>Tsto isches netsebo poloschen;</hi>
that is to say, <hi>In vain dost thou look for what thou hadst not put there.</hi> On the right hand, we had
the view of a spacious and very delightful Champain Country, the ground very rich, with a
high grass on it; but it was not inhabited, and there could be seen only the ruins of Cities and
Villages, which had been heretofore destroy'd by <hi>Tamberlane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 23. The contrary wind forc'd us to Anchor near the River <hi>Adrobe,</hi> where I found the
Elevation to be 53 degr. 48 minutes. In the afternoon, we thought to advance a little by laveer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but we hardly got half a league further.</p>
                  <p>The 24. The contrary wind, still continuing at the same height, forc'd us twice against the
shore, and very much hindred the prosecution of our Voyage. For some dayes following we
had the same incovenience, by reason of the Sand-banks, and the inconstancy of the wind,
which rise about nine in the morning; and about five at night there was not the least breath stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
by that means adding to the affliction which otherwise lay heavy enough on us. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that the indisposition of most of our people made that undelightful voyage the more tedious
to them, continual watching, and the insupportable trouble we were every foot put to, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
them to a very sad condition. Those who had been in action all night, though it was not
their profession to bear Arms, were, in the day time, forc'd to row. Smoak'd and Salt-meats af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
little nourishment, and the discontents arising otherwise upon the frowardness of one of
the Ambassadors, in a manner took away the little courage we had left to encounter with the
great inconveniences of that long voyage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:47786:87"/>
The 25. We saw on the right hand, a Mountain out of which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> get Salt, which
they prepare in certain Huts, built for that purpose at the foot of the Mountain, then expose it
to the Sun, and send it along the <hi>Wolga</hi> for <hi>Moscou.</hi> Opposite to this Mountain is the Island of
<hi>Kostowata.</hi> The River hereabouts is very broad, by reason of the lowness of the shores on both
sides.<note place="margin">The River <hi>Ussa.</hi>
                     </note> Not far hence there is another Mountain, at the foot whereof is the River <hi>Vssa,</hi> which
though it there falls into the <hi>Wolga,</hi> yet is united again to it, sixty <hi>werstes</hi> below <hi>Samara.</hi> There
are on both sides of the River pleasant Pastures; but not far thence there being thick VVoods
with a high Mountain adjoyning, whence Robbers discover at a great distance what Passengers
there are coming, it is very dangerous travelling that way. The <hi>Cosaques</hi> make their advantages
thereof, and not a year before our passage that way, they took a great Vessel loaden, belonging
to one of the richest Merchants of <hi>Nise.</hi> Near this River we had sixty foot water, as also near
the Mountain <hi>Diwisagora,</hi> which word signifies, the Maids Mountain, and the <hi>Muscovites</hi> say
it derives its name from certain Maids that had sometime been kept there by a Shee-Dwarf. VVe
left it on the right hand. It is very high and steepy towards the River, whence it may be seen
divided into several Hills, pleasant to the eye by reason of the diversity of the colours, some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
red, some blew, some yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and representing, at a great distance, the ruins of some
great and magnificent structure. Upon every Hill or Bank is a row of Pine-Trees, so regularly
planted, that a man might doubt whether it were not Artificial, were it not that the Mountain
is inaccessible of all sides. At the foot of this Mountain there rises another, which reaches along
the River, for eight Leagues together. The Valley between those two Mountains, is called
<hi>Iabla-new-quas,</hi> that is to say, Apple-drink, from the great number of Apple-Trees there,
which bear Apples fit only for Cider.</p>
                  <p>The same day we receiv'd Letters from <hi>Moscou</hi> by an express Messenger, who brought us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
Letters from <hi>Nise,</hi> by which we understood, that among our Mariners, there were four <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saques,</hi>
who came into our retinue, purposely to betray us into the hands of their Camerades.
This notice, though we were carefull enough to look after our people before, added to our care,
and made us more vigilant.</p>
                  <p>In the evening, after Sun-set, we perceiv'd two great fires at the entrance of a VVood on the
right hand, which putting us into a fear they might be the <hi>Cosaques</hi> who lay in wait for us,
there were five or six Musketiers sent to discover what they where: but ours having shot off
three Muskets, the other answer'd them with the like number, and discover'd themselves to be
<hi>Strelits,</hi> who had been ordered to Guard a <hi>Persian</hi> Caravan, and were then returning to their
Garrisons. The Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> impatient to hear what accompt our men would bring,
and thinking they stay'd very long, call'd after them as loud as he could, but the contrary wind
hindred them from hearing him; and in that suspence he would have had some of the great Guns
discharg'd at those fires; but the Ambassador <hi>Crusius</hi> oppos'd it, and told him, that their quality
obliging them to stand onely upon the defensive part, he would not by any means consent
thereto.</p>
                  <p>In the night, between the 26. and 27. our Sentinels perceiv'd in a little Boat, two men, who,
thinking to go along by our ship-side, were stay'd, and forc'd to come aboard us. They said
they were fisher-men, and that the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> whom they called their brethren, suffered them
to go along with their Boats by night as well as by day: but, in regard we were told, the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saques</hi>
took this course, and were wont to come near Vessels, to cut their Cables, we examin'd
them apart, and finding their answers different, one saying there were 500. <hi>Cosaques</hi> waiting for
us, in an Isle near <hi>Soratof,</hi> the other denying it, they were kept all night, and the next morning
we sent them by our <hi>Pristaf</hi> to the <hi>Weywode</hi> of <hi>Samara.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 27. We saw, on the left hand, in a spacious plain, not far from the River side, a Hill of
Sand like a Down. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> call it <hi>Sariol Kurgan,</hi> and affirm, that a certain <hi>Tartarian</hi>
Emperour, named <hi>Momaon,</hi> who had a design to enter <hi>Muscovy,</hi> together with seven Kings
of the same Nation, dy'd in that place, and that his Soldiers, instead of burying him, fill'd
their Head-pieces and Bucklers with Sand, and so cover'd the body that it became a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                  <p>About a League from the said Hill, and on the same side, begins the Mountain of <hi>Soccobei,</hi>
which reaches along the River-side, as far as <hi>Samara,</hi> which is distant from that place 15.
<hi>werstes.</hi> It is very high, in a manner all Rock, cover'd with Trees, unless it be on the top,
where it is all bare. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> take much notice of this place, because it is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
passing thereabouts. We came near it about noon, but the contrary wind oblig'd us to cast
Anchor.<note place="margin">The super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi>
                     </note> While we stay'd there we saw coming from the shore two great red Snakes, which
got by the Cables into the ship. As soon as the <hi>Muscovites</hi> perceiv'd them, they intreated us
not to kill them, but to give them somewhat to eat, as being a sort of innocent beasts, sent by
St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to bring us a fair wind, and to comfort us in our affliction.</p>

which is 350. <hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Casan.</hi> It lies on the left hand, two <hi>werstes</hi> from the River side. It
is, as to form, almost square, all its buildings of VVood, unless it be some Churches, and two

                  <p>We intended to make some stay near the City, in expectation to hear, by our <hi>Pristaf,</hi> what
our Prisoners had depos'd; but the wind came so fair for us, that we thought better not to let
slip the opportunity we then had to make the greatest days journey of any since the beginning of
our Voyage.<note place="margin">The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Cosaques.</hi>
                     </note> Accordingly, we got at night, to the Mountain of the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> which is 115.
<hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Samara,</hi> and so the prognostication of the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Mariners, by the Snakes,
proved true. From the City of <hi>Samara,</hi> to the place where the river <hi>Samar</hi> falls into the <hi>Wolga,</hi>
there is all along one continued mountain. Near the same place, but on the other side of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the River <hi>Ascula</hi> falls into it, so that the falling in of all these waters together, does so swell
the <hi>Wolga,</hi> that in this place it is near two leagues broad. Afterwards, on the right hand may
be seen the mountain called <hi>Pestcherski,</hi> which is in a manner all one Rock, having very little
upon it, and reaching near 40 <hi>werstes</hi> along the river side.</p>
                  <p>About 100 <hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Samara,</hi> in the midst of the river, is the Island of <hi>Batrach,</hi> and ten
<hi>werstes</hi> lower that of <hi>Lopatin,</hi> which is five <hi>werstes</hi> in length, and lies opposite to the river <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
which there falls into the <hi>Wolga,</hi> on the right hand. Afterwards, we pass'd by many little
Isles, and came very late at night to the mountain of the <hi>Cosaques.</hi> It is all bare and without
wood. The <hi>Cosaques</hi> who live upon the River <hi>Don,</hi> and had their retreating places in this
mountain, whence they at a great distance discovered the Boats that were coming down, and
there appointed parties to carry on their Robberies, have given it the name. But ever since the
<hi>Weywode</hi> of <hi>Samara</hi> surpriz'd there a great party of <hi>Cosaques,</hi> whereof there were five or six
hundred kill'd upon the place, they have forborn assembling there in so great numbers, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
only in small parties. All these mountains do sometimes reach a great way into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and sometimes they do but in a manner border the river, to which they serve instead of a
bank. We lay at Anchor all night, at the place where this mountain begins, and the next
day, 29. we pass'd it, and, in our way, the river <hi>Pantzina,</hi> which falls into the <hi>Wolga,</hi> on the
right hand, and having sail'd that day 45 <hi>werstes,</hi> we cast Anchor at night near the Isle of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerinsko,</hi>
where we staid all night. Some Fisher-men, who came aboard, gave us intelligence
that they had seen thereabouts 40 <hi>Cosaques,</hi> who had made their appearance on the river side.
Here we told our people, that our Beer beginning to grow low, they must content themselves
for the future with water, into which they might put a little Vinegar, and so make <hi>Oxicrat</hi>
of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. we came betimes in the morning to the mouth of the river <hi>Zagra,</hi> which falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Wolga</hi> on the right hand, near the Isle of <hi>Zagerinsko,</hi> to which it gives the name. Forty
<hi>werstes</hi> thence, we pass'd by the Isle of <hi>Sosnou,</hi> where news was brought us, that we should
meet with the 500 <hi>Casaques,</hi> of whom one of the Fisher-men of <hi>Samara</hi> had given us an
alarm; whereupon all took Arms, and the Guns were made ready, but we saw not
any body.</p>
                  <p>Towards noon, we came over against the mountain of <hi>Tichy,</hi> which comes out so far on the
right hand, that at a great distance, it seems to dam up the river, which nevertheless is so shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thereabouts, that some affirmed, the <hi>Cosaques</hi> forded it. Not far off there is a Bank of
Sand, called <hi>Owetzabrot,</hi> and several little Isles; full of copses and bushes, which the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saques</hi>
know how to make their advantages of, in the carrying on their enterprises. There we
met with two Fishermen, who told us, that some eight days before, the <hi>Cosaques</hi> had taken
a great Boat from them, and had told them that within a small time, they expected to come
into those parts a great <hi>German</hi> ship. In the evening, we called to two other Fisher-men, who
coming aboard, we asked them what they knew concerning the <hi>Cosaques.</hi> The more aged was
at first cautious and would say nothing, but perceiving, the other, who was much younger,
had not used the same reserv'dness, he confirm'd what his Camerade had said, and assur'd us,
that he had seen 40 <hi>Cosaques</hi> retreating into the Wood, which we discover'd from our Ship, and
that they had six Boats, which they had brought ashore, to be made use of against us. They
both intreated us, to make our best advantage, of that discovery, which would cost them their
lives, if the <hi>Cosaques</hi> came to know as much, and to carry them away as Prisoners, and set
them ashore some <hi>werstes</hi> thence. Which we accordingly did, but we doubled our Guards,
and kept them under a Guard all that night, in regard we had no reason to be more confident
of them, than of the <hi>Cosaques</hi> themselves. The next morning at the Break of day, we dismiss'd
them. That day we sailed 60 <hi>werstes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last of <hi>August,</hi> we had so good a wind that we got 120. <hi>werstes</hi> between Sun and Sun.
The Isle of <hi>Ossino,</hi> ten <hi>werstes</hi> distant from <hi>Saratof,</hi> was the first thing we saw that day. The
Sand-bank which near that place reaches a great way into the River, put us to some difficulty
to pass it. The Ship struck several times against it, yet at last pass'd it without any stop.
Twenty <hi>werstes</hi> thence there is another Isle called <hi>Schismamago,</hi> and then that of <hi>Koltof,</hi> which
is 50 <hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Soratof,</hi> where we found sometimes 16. sometimes 20. sometimes 30. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47786:88"/>
40. foot water. Between these two Isles we met with two great Boats, having each of them
400. Mariners aboard it, one belong'd to the Patriarch, and was loaden with Provisions; the other,
which was loaden with <hi>Cav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yar,</hi> which is a past of the Spawn of Eggs of Sturgeon salted, as we
have said elsewhere, belong'd to the Great Duke. They gave us several Volleys of small shot, and
we answer'd their civility with a great Gun. Near the Isle of <hi>Koltof,</hi> we met with four other Boats,
coming from <hi>Astrachan,</hi> loaden with Salt and Salt-fish, upon the accompt of <hi>Gregori Miki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tof,</hi>
one of the richest Merchants of <hi>Moscou.</hi> The Boat-men told us that they had seen, near
<hi>Astrachan,</hi> in several Boats, about 200. <hi>Cosaques,</hi> who had suffer'd them to pass, without
saying any thing to them. Not far from this I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e may be seen on the right hand, the mountain
of <hi>Smiowa,</hi> which is above 40. <hi>westes</hi> in length. The word <hi>Smiowa</hi> signifies a Serpent, and
they have given the Mountain that name, because it sometimes winds it self a great way into
the Country, sometimes, it only borders the River. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> would have it so called
from a Serpent, or Dragon, which having done abundance of mischief thereabouts, was kill'd
by some great Heroe, and cut into three pieces, which were immediately metamorphosed into
so many stones, and are shewn to this day, to such as pass that way. From this Mountain, all
along the plain may be seen many Isles, which they call <hi>Sarok ostrowe,</hi> that is to say, the Forty
Isles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 1. betimes in the morning,<note place="margin">SEPTEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BER.</note> we met with three great Boats, between 5. and 600. tun a
piece, which yet took up but 12. foot of water. They tow'd after them a great many little
Boats, in order to the unloading of the great ones, where the River is not deep enough. The
biggest of them carried Provisions for the Monastery of <hi>Troitza,</hi> whereof we have spoken else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
The Salute was the same with what we had made to those we had met before. About
nine in the morning,<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Soratof.</hi>
                     </note> we pass'd in sight of the City of <hi>Soratof.</hi> It is seartd at 52. deg. 12. min.
elevation, in great plain four <hi>werstes</hi> from the River, and upon a branch which the <hi>Wolga</hi>
makes on that side. All the Inhabitants are <hi>Muscovian</hi> Musketiers, under the command of a
<hi>Weywode,</hi> sent thither by the Great Duke, for the preservation of the Country, against the
<hi>Tartars,</hi> called <hi>Kalmuches,</hi> who are possess'd of a vast Country, reaching from those parts as
far as the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, and to the River <hi>Iaika.</hi> These <hi>Tartars</hi> make frequent incursions as far as
the River <hi>Wolga,</hi> and are not so inconsiderable, but that they many times proclaim open War
against the Great Duke. From <hi>Samara</hi> to <hi>Soratof,</hi> are 350. <hi>werstes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second, having a fair wind, we pass'd in sight of the Isles of <hi>Kriusna</hi> and <hi>Sapunofka,</hi>
which are at a small distance one from the other, and came to the Mountain of <hi>Achmats Kigori,</hi>
which ends at an Isle of the same name, 50. <hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Saratof.</hi> This Mountain affords a very
pleasant Prospect, in as much as the top of it is clad with a perfectly-excellent verdure, the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
checquer'd with a soil or mold of several different colours, and the skirt of it is a very great
bank, so even, that it seems to have been done by hand. Twenty <hi>worstes</hi> from the Isle of <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matsko</hi>
we saw that of <hi>Solotoi,</hi> and afterwards the Mountain of <hi>Sallottogori,</hi> or the Golden
Mountain. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> told us, that name was given it, for this reason, that heretofore
the <hi>Tartars</hi> had thereabouts surpriz'd a <hi>Muscovian</hi> Fleet, so richly loaden, that they divided
Gold and Silver by the Bushel. VVe were no sooner past by this Mountian, but we came in
sight of another, called <hi>Millobe,</hi> that is to say, Chalk. It reaches along the River 40. <hi>werstes,</hi>
having the top as even as if it had been done by a Level, and makes an insensible descent down to
the River, at the foot whereof are many Trees planted checquer-wise. After this, we came to
another Mountain on which we bestow'd the name of the Mountain of Pillars, for as much as
the rains having wash'd away the earth in several places, they look'd at a distance, like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Pillars, out of order, of several colours, Blew, Red, Yellow, and Green. Here we met
with another great Boat, the Pilot whereof sent us word, that he had seen near <hi>Astrachan</hi> about
70. <hi>Cosaques,</hi> who has suffered them to pass without saying ought to them; but withall, that
some four days before ten of those Rogues had trapann'd him out of 500. Crowns, not by
setting on the Boat, where they should have met with resistance, since they could have made
their party good against a much greater number of Enemies; but they had taken that Boat
and the Anchor, which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> make use of when they go against the stream of the
River (as we have express'd elsewhere) and kept both till the fore-said sum was sent them.
In the evening, assoon as we had cast Anchor, we saw coming towards us ten <hi>Cosaques,</hi> who
went into a Boat, and cross'd to the other side of the River. The Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
commanded eight Musketiers, taken, some out of our retinue, some from among the
Soldiery, to follow the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> to find out what their design was, and to endeavour to bring
them aboard. But the <hi>Cosaques</hi> had time enough to get ashore, and retreat into the wood, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they also carried their Boat; so that it was far night ere our people return'd. Our Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
was much troubled thereat, and represented to <hi>Brugman,</hi> how dangerous it was, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
our people at such unseasonable hours, and that in a place where they could not be reliev'd;
but the other was so much incens'd at these remonstrances, that he gave the Steward very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
language.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 3. we saw on the left hand the River of <hi>Ruslana,</hi> and opposite thereto on the right hand,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47786:89"/>
the mountain of <hi>Vrakufs Karul,</hi> which is 150 <hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Saratof.</hi> They say that a <hi>Tartarian</hi>
Prince, named <hi>Vrak,</hi> who giving Battel to the <hi>Cosaques</hi> in that place, was there kill'd and
buried, gave it the name. Thence we came to the mountain <hi>Kamaschinka,</hi> and to the river of
the same name. It rises out of the torrent of <hi>Iloba,</hi> which falls into the <hi>Don,</hi> which falls into
the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, and divides <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Cosaques</hi> cross this river in little Boats, and
make their incursions as far as upon the <hi>Wolga;</hi> so that this is the most dangerous place of any.
We saw along the River-side, upon the right hand several wooden Crosses, set there
to signifie the Sepulchres of a great number of <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who had been kill'd there
by the <hi>Cosaques.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having pass'd this place, we perceived the <hi>Caravan</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Tartary;</hi> it consisted of six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
great Boats, and six little ones. As soon as they saw us, the Mariners gave over rowing,
and went only as the stream carried them, to the end we might overtake them; which oblig'd
us to make all the Sail we could, and to do what else lay in our power, till we got up to them.
We soon express'd our joy, by the noise of our Trumpets, and saluted the Caraven with four
great Pieces; they answer'd with all their small shot, which oblig'd us to give them another
Volley.</p>
                  <p>The principal persons of this Caravan, who could not have all met till they came to <hi>Samara,</hi>
were, a <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince, named <hi>Massal,</hi> the <hi>Cuptzi,</hi> or the King of <hi>Persian</hi>'s Merchant,
whom we spake of before, a <hi>Muscovian Poslanick,</hi> named <hi>Alexei Savinowits Romantzikou,</hi>
sent by the Great Duke to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> an Ambassador from the <hi>Crim-Tartars,</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
or Factor from the Chancellor of <hi>Persia,</hi> and two Merchants of the Province of <hi>Kilan</hi> in
<hi>Persia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Immediately after these first general expressions of joy, we saw coming towards us a <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi>
Officer, attended by a considerable number of Musketeers, who came to give us a Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
and inquire after our health, from the Prince of <hi>Tartary.</hi> As they came up to our Ship,
the <hi>Strelits</hi> discharg'd their Muskets, and then only the Officer came aboard, and made his
complement. As soon as he left us the Ambassadors sent to the said Prince, the Sieur <hi>Vchterits,</hi>
who was accompany'd by <hi>Thomas de Melleville,</hi> and our <hi>Muscovian</hi> Interpreter; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Secretary of the Embassy, who took along with him the <hi>Persian</hi> Interpreter, to go
at the same time and complement the <hi>Cuptzi,</hi> who had in the interim sent one of his retinue to
do the like to the Ambassadors.</p>
                  <p>The Secretary coming to the Lar-board-side of the <hi>Cuptzi</hi>'s Vessel, would have got up into
it there, but his servants, acquainting him that the Masters Wife having her lodgings on that
side, it would not be so fit for him, so that he was forc'd to order the Boat to go about the Ship,
and to get in the other side.<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Persia's</hi> Cuptzi.</note> As we got in there stood several Servants, very handsome persons,
who took us by the arms to help us up, and conducted us to the <hi>Kuptzi</hi>'s Chamber. We found
him sitting in a Couch, which was raised two foot high, and cover'd with a piece of the best
kind of <hi>Persian</hi> Tapestry. He had under him a coarse piece of <hi>Turkey</hi> Tapestry, setting cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg'd,
according to the custome of his Countrey, resting his back on a Crimson Satin
cushion.</p>
                  <p>He received us with much civility, putting his hands to his breast, and making a low inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the head, which are the ordinary Ceremonies, wherewith they receive those-Persons,
whom they would do the greatest honour. He intreated us to sit down by him, which out of
complyance we did, but not without much trouble to us, as being not accustomed to continue
any long time in that posture. He very handsomely receiv'd our complement, and answer'd it
with so much of obligation and kindness, that we could not but be much taken with his civility.
He told us among other things, that he was extremely desirous to see his own Country, and
his own House, but the satisfaction it would be to him to see either of them, would not be
comparable to that which he had conceiv'd at the first sight of our Ship. He added, that as soon
as we were come into <hi>Persia,</hi> we should find the roughness and barbarism of the Nation, among
whom we then were, chang'd into an obliging civility, to pleasant conversation, and into a
manner of life absolutely inviting, and that attended with a freedom, which should be common
to us with all the Inhabitants of the Country. That, he hoped, at his arrival at the Court.
it would not be hard for him, with the assistance of his Friends there, to obtain the charge of
<hi>Mehemander,</hi> or Conductor, for our Embassy, since he had the happiness of our acquaintance
by the way: That then he would oblige us upon all occasions, and in the mean time intreated
us to dispose of his person, and whatever was in the Ship, as we pleased. He treated us with a
Collation, which was serv'd in, Plate Vermilion-gilt, and consisted only in Fruits, Grapes,
and Pistachoes, dry'd and pickled. The only drink we had, was an excellent kind of <hi>Muscovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Aquavitae, wherein he first drunk the health of the two Ambassadors together, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that of each of them by himself, which happened at the same time that his own was
drunk in our ship, which we knew to be so by the joint Volley of both the great Guns, and the
small shot. Taking our leave of him, he told us as a great Secret, that he had some news to
tell the Ambassadors; which was, that he had it from a very good hand, that the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:47786:89"/>
had sent an Ambassador to <hi>Schach Sefi,</hi> that he had taken his way by <hi>Constantinople</hi> and
<hi>Bagdet;</hi> that he was then upon his return to <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and that he had order, in his way, to
see the Great Duke; but that the <hi>Weywode</hi> would not permit him to pass, till he had first heard
from the Court. That this was all he knew of it, and that the Ambassadors might guess
at the rest as also what may have been the occasion of his Voyage and Negotiation.</p>
                  <p>The other eminent Persons of the Caravan sent also to complement us, and to make proffer of
their services, intreating us to keep them company, and assuring us of their assistance if need
were. After a general Volley of all the Caravan, we parted, and kept on our course. At night
we had a great Tempest, with two extraordinary Thunder-claps, and some flashes of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
but the weather soon became fair again, and we had a great calm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 4. being Sunday, just as our Minister was beginning his Sermon, came aboard us seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Tartars,</hi> whom <hi>Mussal</hi> the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince of <hi>Circassia</hi> sent to tell us, that, his disposition
would not suffer him to give the Ambassadors a personal visit, but as soon as his health would
permit him to take the air, it should be the first thing he did. The equipage of those who came
along with the Person employ'd in this Message my very well deserve a little remark from us.
As to his Person, he was somewhat of the tallest, his complexion of an Olive-colour, his hair
long, greasie, and black as Jet, and his beard of the same colour and fashion. He had upon his
upper Garment, some black-Sheep-skin, the woolly side out, a Callot, or close Cap, on his
head, and his countenance such as a Painter might well take for an original, if he were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the Devil. His retinue were in no better order, having about them only Coats, or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of some very coarse Cloath, brown or black. We entertain'd them with certain Gobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
of Aquavitae, and sent them sufficiently drunk to their Ship.</p>
                  <p>About noon we came to the River of <hi>Bolloclea,</hi> in the mid-way between <hi>Kamuschin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka,</hi>
and <hi>Zariza, 90 werstes</hi> distant from either of them. Having sail'd sixteen <hi>werstes</hi>
further, we came to a very high hill of sand, called <hi>Strehlne,</hi> near which we stayd all
night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 5. we had hardly weigh'd Anchor, but the current forc'd us upon a sand-bank, where
we found but five foot and a half water. While we were busied about getting off the Ship, the
Caravan got before us, and made towards <hi>Zariza,</hi> with a design to take in there some other
Muskettiers for its convoy to <hi>Astrachan.</hi> About noon, we got to a place whence we might
have gone in less than a days time as far as the River <hi>Don,</hi> called by <hi>Ptolomey</hi> and other Antient
Geographers <hi>Tanais,</hi> which advances in that place as far as within seven leagues of the <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The first Branch of <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     </note>
taking its course towards the East. A little lower, near <hi>Achtobska Vtska,</hi> the <hi>Wolga</hi> divides
it self into two branches, whereof one, which takes into the Country on the left hand, goes a
course contrary to that of the great River, taking towards East-North-East; but about one
<hi>werste</hi> thence, it re-assumes its former course, and returns towards the South-East<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so
to fall into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. In this place I found the Elevation to be 48 degrees, 51
minutes.</p>
                  <p>Five <hi>werstes</hi> from the River, and seven from <hi>Zariza,</hi> may yet be seen the ruins of a City,
which they say was built by <hi>Tamberlane.</hi> It was called <hi>Zaarefgorod,</hi> that is to say, the Royal
City; its Palace and Walls were of Brick, which they still carry thence to build Walls,
Churches and Monasteries at <hi>Astrachan;</hi> even at the time of our passage that way; they were
loading several great Boats with Brick, bound for the place aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>In this place, we saw a Fisher-man, who coming close by our Ship-side, took a <hi>Bieluga,</hi> or
white-fish,
which was above eight foot long, and above four foot broad. It was somewhat
like a Sturgeon, but much whiter, and had a wider mouth. They kill it much after the same
manner as Oxen are kill'd among us, by first stunning it with a knock with a mallet. They
sold it us for fifty pence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 6. We overtook the <hi>Caravan,</hi> at <hi>Zariza,</hi> where most of the Passengers were landed,
and lodg'd in Tents, upon the River-side, expecting the Convoy, which was to be sent from
the adjacent Towns: but the wind being still fair for us, we kept on our course. The City of

                     </note> is distant from <hi>Soratof 350 werstes,</hi> and lies on the right side of the River, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of a Hill, fortify'd with five Bastions, and as many wooden Towers. It hath no other
Inhabitants than about 400 <hi>Strelits</hi> or Muskettiers, who serve against the incursions of the
<hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Cosaques,</hi> and are oblig'd to Convoy the Boats which go up, and come down the
River. There I found the elevation to be 49 d. and 42. m.</p>
                  <p>From the City of <hi>Zariza</hi> to <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, there is only wast grounds and
heaths, and so barren a soyl, that being not able to bring forth any kind of Corn, all that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
even the City of <hi>Astrachan</hi> it self, is forc'd to send for Wheat to <hi>Casan,</hi> whence there comes
such abundance, that it is cheaper at <hi>Astrachan</hi> than it is at <hi>Moscou.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Below <hi>Zariza</hi> lies the Isle of <hi>Zerpinske.</hi> It is twelve <hi>werstes</hi> in length, and the Souldiers of
the Garrison of <hi>Zariza,</hi> send their Cattel thither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

observ'd that the Wives and Daughters of those Soldiers crossed over to the Island without
any Guard, went thither one day after them, surpriz'd, ravish'd, and sent them back to their

husbands,<note place="margin">1366.</note> without doing them any other mischief. Behind this Isle, there falls into the <hi>Wolga</hi> a
little River, which rises out of the <hi>Don,</hi> but it hath hardly water enough for little Boats, which
I conceive may be the reason, why Geographers represent it not in their Maps; there being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Isaac Massa,</hi> who hath put it into his, and calls it <hi>Kamous.</hi> The heats were there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abouts so
great in the moneth of <hi>September,</hi> as that of the Dog-dayes is not more insupportable in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi>
yet the <hi>Muscovites</hi> affirm'd, they were but ordinary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 7. The weather chang'd, and a Tempest following, we could not advance much. Having
sayl'd ten <hi>werstes,</hi> we saw, on the right hand, a Gibet erected upon a high reddish Hill. It was
the first we had seen in those parts, and we were told it was set up by the <hi>Weywode</hi> of the next
City, for the execution of the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> he should take within his Government, and that he
gave them no other quarter, but that their Camerades suffered not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the bodies to hang there
above five or six dayes.</p>
                  <p>The same day an humour took the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> to cause all the Servants belonging
to the Embassy to come before him, to whom he said, that he had reason to believe, that there
were many among them, who express'd little kindness and respect towards him, and, if occasion
serv'd, would do him all the ill Offices lay in their power, and consequently that his desire was,
that the Musicians, the Guards, and the Lacqueyes, should take their Oaths to be faithful to
him. Answer was made him, that his distrust was ill-grounded; that they saw not any reason
why they should be oblig'd to a thing so extraordinary, and that they were so far from having
any ill design against him, that, on the contrary, they were all ready to lay down their lives to
do him any service; but that they intreated him, for his part, to spare them as much as might be,
and to treat them more mildly than he had done: which he promised to do, but it was one of
those promises that are either kept or broken.</p>
                  <p>The same day we met with a great Boat, the Master whereof sent some Mariners aboard us,
to desire us to pity their sad condition, and to relieve them with a little bread, in the extremity
they were in, having not eaten ought for the space of four dayes. They told us it was three
weeks since they came from <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and that they had been robb'd in their way by thirty
<hi>Cosaques,</hi> who had taken away all their Provisions. VVe gave them a sack full of pieces of bread,
for which they gave us thanks, with their ordinary Ceremonies, bowing their heads down to
the ground.</p>
                  <p>Forty <hi>Werstes</hi> from <hi>Zariza,</hi> lies the Isle of <hi>Nassonofska,</hi> and opposite thereto, on the right
hand, a great flat Mountain of the same name. Between the Isle and the Mountain there is a
kind of a Grott, where the <hi>Cosaques</hi> had, some years before, kill'd a great number of <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
who had lay'n there in ambush, to surprise the others. In the evening, a certain Fisher-man
brought us a kind of fish w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ich we had never seen before. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> called it
<hi>Tziberika,</hi> and it was above five foot long, with a long and broad snout like the Bill of a wild
Drake, and the body full of black and white spots, like the Dogs of <hi>Poland,</hi> but much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
unless it were about the belly, where it was all white. It had an excellent good taste, and
was at least as pleasant as that of Salmon. he sold us also another kind of fish much resembling
a Sturgeon, but much less, and incomparably more delicate, whereof there are abundance in the
<hi>Wolga.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 8. The <hi>Caravan,</hi> which we had left at <hi>Zariza,</hi> came up to us near a Cape, called <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powitska
Iurga,</hi> upon this accompt that the son of a <hi>Muscovian</hi> Pope or Priest, who had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
headed the <hi>Cosaques</hi> and <hi>Bandits,</hi> was wont to make his retreat, and appoint his rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
at that place. They count from <hi>Zariza</hi> to that place 70. <hi>werstes,</hi> and thence to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>Kamnagar,</hi> which lay on our right hand, 40. <hi>werstes.</hi> The River thereabouts is full of
Isles and Sand-banks, by which the <hi>Caravan</hi> was no less incommodated than we were, though
their Vessels were much less than ours. Twenty <hi>werstes</hi> lower there is a very high Island, four
<hi>werstes</hi> in length, called <hi>Wesowi,</hi> near a River of the same name, which falls into the <hi>Wolga</hi> on
the right hand. Thirty <hi>werstes</hi> lower, the wind forc'd us into a corner, where the River of
<hi>Wolodinerski Vtsga</hi> falls into the <hi>Wolga.</hi> But in regard we were loath to let slip the opportunity
of making a great dayes journey, which the fairness of that wind put us in hope we might do,
we with much difficulty made a shift to get out, and afterwards pass'd by the Country of <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi>
thirty <hi>werstes</hi> from the City of <hi>Tzornogar,</hi> which was the first we were to come at the
next day. Ten <hi>werstes</hi> lower, the <hi>Wolga</hi> puts out a second branch on the left hand, called <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tobenisna
Vtsga,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The second branch of the <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     </note> which joyns its waters to those of <hi>Achtobska,</hi> whereof we spoke before.
Thence we sayl'd five <hi>werstes</hi> further, where the whole fleet cast Anchor, near the Isle of <hi>Ossina,</hi>
which is seven <hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Tzornogar.</hi> So that, that day we got 135. <hi>werstes,</hi> or 27. <hi>German</hi>
Leagues, that is, at the least as far as it is from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Saumur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this Countrey quite down to <hi>Astrachan,</hi> on both sides of the River, there grows
abundance of Liquorice, having a stalk as big as ones arm, and about some four foot high. The
seed of it is much like a vitch, and lies in cods upon the top of the stalk. The Champain part of
<hi>Media</hi> is cover'd therewith, especially towards the River <hi>Araxes;</hi> but the juyce of it is much
sweeter, and the root much bigger than that which grows in <hi>Europe.</hi>

                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">1636.</note> There rose a wind, which soon grew into a Tempest, and brought us about noon
before the little City of <hi>Tzornogar,</hi> where we stay'd. It was but some nine years before,
that the Great Duke had given order for the building of this City,<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Tzornogar.</hi>
                     </note> which lies 200. <hi>werstes</hi> from
<hi>Zariza,</hi> some half a League lower than it is now: but the great floods having wash'd away the
earth along the shore, in such great quantities, that the course of the River seem'd to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
diverted, and that it would be ill coming ashore there, they translated the City to the
place where it is now. It is seated upon a high shore, on the right side of the River, and is
fortify'd with eight wooden Towers, and a Rampier with thick planks, having no other
Inhabitants than three or four hundred Souldiers, who are kept there to secure the Countrey
against the incursions of the <hi>Cosaques</hi> and <hi>Kalmuckas Tartars.</hi> There is at each corner of the
City, which is square, a particular place for the Sentinels to stand, erected upon four great
poles, whence they have a full prospect into a spacious plain as far as they can see, without
the least interposition of any wood, or other eminency.</p>
                  <p>What oblig'd the Great Duke to order the building of this City, was, the mischiefs done
thereabouts by the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> but particularly, the defeat of a <hi>Caravan,</hi> of 1500. <hi>Muscovites:</hi>
who were there surpriz'd some ten years before. It had a very strong Convoy, but the River
being extremely swift in that place, and the Convoy being gone before, the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> who had
suffered the Soldiers to pass by, came out of their Ambushes, set upon the <hi>Caravan,</hi> kill'd seven
or eight hundred men, and took away all before the Convoy could come up, the violence of the
current not suffering it to get up the River time enough to relieve them. Between that place
and the <hi>Astrachan,</hi> there are no Trees to be seen on the River-side.</p>
                  <p>The 10. We left <hi>Tzornogar,</hi> but the wind turning against us, we could hardly get ten
<hi>werstes</hi> that day. About noon, some fisher-men brought us a noble Carp, which weigh'd at
least thirty pounds, with eight other fish, of those they call <hi>Sandates,</hi> the fairest we had seen in
all our Voyage. We would have paid for them, but they refus'd our money, and told us, that
they fish'd there for certain Merchants of <hi>Moscou,</hi> who having farm'd the fishing of that place
from the Great Duke, would be sure to have them severely punish'd, if ever it should come to
their knowledge, that they had sold any fish. We soon found their design was to be paid in
Aquavitae, accordingly a quart was ordered to be given them, wherewith they seemed to be very
well satisfy'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 11. The wind and weather fair, we got 120. <hi>werstes,</hi> but without any accident worth
noting, save that about noon, we pass'd by the Mountain of <hi>Polowon,</hi> so called, because half-way
between <hi>Astrachan</hi> and <hi>Zariza, 250. werstes,</hi> distant from each of them. We pass'd over
the night near the Isle of <hi>Kyssar,</hi> where the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> who was upon the Guard,
hearing that the Sentinel had discovered a great Boat, which the current of the River brought
somewhat near our Vessel, and that upon calling to them, no body answer'd, commanded fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Muskets to be shot off, and at the same time, a great Gun to be fired. All took the Alarm;
but hardly was every man got to his station, ere they might perceive coming to the ship-side a
small boat, guided by only one man, who gave us this accompt of himself, that his boat was
loaden with Salt, and that his seven Camerades, being acquainted with some of the <hi>Caravan,</hi>
had been so treated by them with Aquavitae, that being all dead asleep, he had been forc'd to
let the boat go with the stream. Our Pilot knew the man, as being an Inhabitant of <hi>Nise,</hi>
whereupon we gave him some Gobelets of Aquavitae, and sent him back to his boat. The next
day, he came to acknowledge our kindness to him, by a present of certain Sturgeons.</p>
                  <p>The night following, the wind continuing fair, we thought fit to improve the opportunity,
and so set sayl by three in the morning. <hi>Sept.</hi> 12. We soon came, upon the left hand, to a
third branch of the <hi>Wolga,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The third branch of the <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     </note> called <hi>Buch wostowa,</hi> which falls into the two precedent. Thence we
came to the Isle of <hi>Coppono,</hi> from which the name <hi>Coponogar</hi> is deriv'd to the County, which is
opposite thereto, on the right side of the River. From this place, there are 150. <hi>werstes</hi> to
<hi>Astrachan.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The fourth branch of the <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     </note> Twenty <hi>werstes</hi> lower, the <hi>Wolga</hi> makes a fourth branch, on the left hand, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Danilofska Vtsga,</hi> which mingles not with any of the other three, but disembogues it self
by a particular Chanel into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. Fifteen <hi>werstes</hi> thence lies, in the midst of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the Isle of <hi>Katarinski,</hi> which is little, but very pleasant, by reason of the Wood, and other
plants that grow on it. Not far from it, we saw upon a Sand-bank the Carkass of a Boat,
which had been cast away there and was half rotten. Being seen at some distance, a man might
take it for a Fort, built there by the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> nay there were those who imagined they had
seen some of them, which occasion'd a command to be given that some shot should be made into
the Wood; but it was done with so much Precipitation, that one of the Muskets, breaking in
the hands of our Cook, the splinters took off the Thumb of his left hand, and hurt him in the
forehead and breast. We stay'd the next night, near the Isle of <hi>Piruski, 80. werstes</hi> from <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi>
after we had sail'd a hundred that day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 13. while we were, after morning prayer, reading some Chapters out of the Bible,
and among others the XIII of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where <hi>Moses</hi> speaks of the fertility of the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and the excellency of its Fruits, especially of the Grapes, brought thence by the Spies,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47786:91"/>
there came two Boats from <hi>Astrachan,</hi> which brought us some Fruits to sell. We were so sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
thereat, that, for my part, I am in doubt whether that of the Holy Land could be better;
so delicious were the Melons and Peaches, and the Kernels of the Grapes were as big as Nuts.
This day betimes in the morning, we came in sight of another Branch of the <hi>Wolga,</hi> called <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuska,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A fifth Branch of the <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     </note>
which at some distance from the River, is divided into two other Branches; whereof
the one is united to the <hi>Danilofski Vtsga,</hi> which we spoke of before, and the other falls again
into the main river, at some <hi>werstes</hi> thence. We were told, that was the most dangerous place
of all the river, by reason those Robbers had their rendevouz and retreating places thereabouts.
For indeed, we saw, between two Isles, a great number of <hi>Cosaques,</hi> at whom the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<hi>Brugman</hi> caus'd a great Gun to be fired. Five <hi>werstes</hi> lower, and 70 from <hi>Astrachan,</hi> we
came to the last sand-bank, which is called <hi>Kabangameel.</hi> Five <hi>werstes</hi> thence, to the Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of <hi>Kabangengar;</hi> and five lower, to the Isle of <hi>Itziburki,</hi> where we stay'd that night, 50
<hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Astrachan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We saw in those parts, as also afterwards near <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, a
kind of wild Geese, or rather Cormorants, which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> call <hi>Babbes,</hi> which in a
manner cover'd the river side; but of them more at large, when we come to the description of
the City, and of the Country of <hi>Nagaia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 14. We were stay'd by a contrary wind, and a tempest coming from the South-East,
so that we could hardly advance two <hi>werstes,</hi> ere we were forc'd to cast Anchor, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
there till the next day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We lay at 80 foot water. The <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince sent us a Present of
Beer, Hydromel and Aquavitae, with notice, that if we liked it, we might have more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 15. the wind changing, we set sail by four in the morning, taking our course South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and betimes in the morning, came before the Isle of <hi>Busan, 25 werstes</hi> from <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan;</hi>
and afterwards to a sixth Branch of the River <hi>Wolga,</hi>

that part of the World, which we may in some manner call our Country, we made our first
step into the other. We made some stay before the City, in the midst of the River, and salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it with a Volley both of all our great Guns, and small shot, whereat the Inhabitants, who
were come in great numbers to the river-side, were the more surpriz'd, by reason they were
not accustomed to hear Thunders of that kind.</p>
                  <p>It will not be amiss in this place, by a short digression, to give an account of the situation of

                     <note place="margin">A descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the City of <hi>strachan.</hi>
                     </note> of the qualities of the Country, and the life of the Inhabitants. The Antient Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers,
as <hi>Ptolomy, Strabo,</hi> and others, who follow them, had no knowledge of these <hi>Tartars,</hi>
no more than their neighbours, and have not made any mention of them, but only under a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
name of <hi>Scythians</hi> aud <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> though they should indeed have been distinguish'd into so
many different Nations, suitable to the diversity there is in their Names, their Language, and
manner of Life; in all which they have nothing common one with the other. <hi>Mathias de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chou,</hi>
a Physician, and Canon of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> who liv'd at the beginning of the last age, says
that those, who confound the <hi>Tartars</hi> with those Nations, which the Antients called <hi>Getae, Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thae,</hi>
and <hi>Sarmatae,</hi> are much mistaken, in as much as the <hi>Tartars</hi> have not been known, but
since the thirteenth Age. For in <hi>May</hi> 1211. there appear'd a Comet, which, having its tail
towards the West, and menacing the <hi>Don</hi> and <hi>Russia,</hi> presag'd the invasion which the <hi>Tartars</hi>
made into those parts the year following. They were certain <hi>Indian</hi> Lords, who having kill'd
their King, <hi>David,</hi> got away, first, towards the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, near the <hi>Palus Meotides,</hi> where
lived the antient <hi>Getae,</hi> whence they afterwards advanc'd towards the <hi>Don,</hi> and thence to the
river <hi>Wolga,</hi> where they live to this day. The same Author distinguishes them into four spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;

<hi>Volha</hi>) those of <hi>Precop,</hi> those of <hi>Casan,</hi> and those of <hi>Nagaia,</hi> who are those of whom we are
to treat of at present. <hi>Alexander Guagnin,</hi> of <hi>Verona,</hi> divides them into eight Colonies, and
gives them other names; but it is our design to entertain the Reader only with what we have
seen, and to discover that part of <hi>Tartaria</hi> through which we travel'd. We say then, that they

Sea, wherewith it infected the whole Air. At our return that way, our stay there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be in <hi>Iune, Iuly</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> and yet the heats were not absolutely insupportable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they were moderated by the coolness, which the South-wind continually brought along
with it. But what is to be most admir'd, is, that, in this hot Climat, the Winter, which lasts
but two months; is so exceeding cold, that the River is frozen up, and bears Sledges. Which
is contrary to what other Authors say of it, yet the Reader may take it for most certain.</p>
                  <p>The Island of <hi>Dolgoi</hi> is sandy and barren,<note place="margin">The Isle of <hi>Dolgoi.</hi>
                     </note> insomuch, that some Gardens, and Lands cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Inhabitants of <hi>Astrachan,</hi> excepted, it produces nothing at all, no more than does
the Continent, on the right hand; but on the left, towards the river <hi>Iaika,</hi> there are very good
pastures. On this side the <hi>Wolga,</hi> West-ward, lies a long Heath of above 70. <hi>German</hi> leagues,
reaching as far as the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea, and towards the South, another, of above 80. leagues, along
the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea: as we found at our return from <hi>Persia,</hi> when it was our chance to measure it,
by eleven very tedious dayes journeys. Yet are not these Deserts so barren, but they produce
more Salt,<note place="margin">Salt-pits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> than the marshes in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> do. The Inhabitants of those parts call them
<hi>Mozakofski, Kainkowa,</hi> and <hi>Gwostofski,</hi> which are ten, fifteen, and thirty <hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi>
and have salt veins, which the Sun bakes and causes to swim upon the face of the water
about a finger thick, much like Rock-Christal, and in such abundance, that, paying an Impost
of a half-penny upon every <hi>Poude,</hi> that is, forty pound weight, a man may have as much as
he pleases. It smells like that of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Muscovites</hi> drive a great Trade with it, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to the side of the <hi>Wolga,</hi> where they put it up in great heaps, till they have the convenience
of transporting it elsewhere. <hi>Petreius,</hi> in his <hi>History of Muscovy,</hi> sayes, that within two
leagues of <hi>Astrachan,</hi> there are two mountains, which he calls <hi>Busin,</hi> which afford such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Rock-salt, that, if thirty thousand men were perpetually at work about it, they would
not be able to exhaust the pits. But I could learn nothing of those imaginary Mountains. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
indeed it is, that the salt-veins we speak of, are inexhaustible, and that as soon as you have
taken off one crust or face of it, there comes up another. The same <hi>Petreius</hi> is also much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
when he sayes, that <hi>Media, Persia</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> are supply'd with Salt from these
Mountains, whereas these Countries have Salt marshes of their own, as also <hi>Muscovy</hi> hath, as
we shall see in the sequel of this Relation.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Astrachan</hi> to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, are twelve leagues, and thereabouts, the river does so
abound with fish, that we bought twelve large Carps for two pence, and two hundred young
Sturgeons, which are very delicate there, for half a Crown. It produces also Lobsters, or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crevices,
which multiply in a manner to infinity, by reason the <hi>Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> eat not
of them. The Isles which are in the river afford habitations for all manner of Fowl, especially
an infinite number of wild Geese and Ducks, which the <hi>Tartars</hi> take with Falcons and Hawks,
and are very expert in the ordering of those Birds for that kind of sport. They are also excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
well skill'd in the hunting of the wild Bore; but in regard their Religion permits them
not to eat of it, they sell them for a small matter to the <hi>Muscovites.</hi>

                     <hi>Arpus,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
Karpus,</hi> because they are extremely cooling, and the <hi>Persians, Hinduanes,</hi> because they
had the first seeds of them from the <hi>Indies.</hi> This Fruit is excellently good, and very pleasant to
the tast, as also to the eye, having the rind of a lively-green colour, the meat of a pale Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the seed black. The <hi>Tartars,</hi> who brought them to the City in Carts, sold them
two or three a penny.</p>
                  <p>It is not many years since that they have had Grapes among them, the Inhabitants of <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi>
being oblig'd for these to the Merchants of <hi>Persia,</hi> who brought the first sets thither, which
an old Monk of a Convent that is in the Suburbs planted in his Garden. The Great Duke hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it had taken with good success, and having tasted the Grape, sent order to the Monk,
in the year 1613. to improve his stock, which he did, and that with such increase, that at the
time of our being there, there was no house almost, but had its Arbours and Walks set about
with Vines, to the so great advantage of the Planters, that the Master of the house where I
lodg'd told me, the Vines he had about his house had yielded him a hundred Crowns the year
before. These Grapes, with some other Fruits, were either sent to the Great Duke, or sold
to the neighbouring <hi>Weywodes:</hi> but some years since, they have planted a Vine there, which
hath yielded in one year above 60. Pipes of excellent Wine.</p>
                  <p>The Monk I spoke of was living at our being there, and was a hundred and five years of age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He was a <hi>German,</hi> born in <hi>Austria,</hi> and had been carried away prisoner very young by some
<hi>Turkish</hi> Soldiers, who had sold him into <hi>Muscovy,</hi> where he had chang'd his Religion, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47786:92"/>
became a Monk. He was at that time Superior of the Monastery, and still remembred some <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
words, but very few. He was a very good natur'd Man, and shew'd how much he was
taken with our conversation, by the frequent visits he made us: but as soon as he had taken off
two or three Dishes of Aquavitae, he was subject to the ordinary weaknesses of those of his age,
threw away his staff, and fell a dancing, though not with over much confidence.</p>
                  <p>Heretofore,<note place="margin">Its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</note> all <hi>Nagaia</hi> was inhabited by <hi>Tartars,</hi> who had their particular King, and held
a very fair correspondency with their Neighbours of <hi>Casan</hi> and <hi>Crim,</hi> with whom they also ran
the same fortune after their defeat. For the Great Duke, <hi>Iohn Basilouits,</hi> having reduc'd under
his Jurisdiction the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Casan,</hi> in the year 1552. two years after, set upon those of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaia,</hi>
and took the City of <hi>Astrachan</hi> by assault, <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. 1554. He forc'd thence all the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
and, having peopled the City with <hi>Muscovites,</hi> he compassed it with a stone wall, and
added some other Fortifications: but it was the Great Duke <hi>Michael Foederouits,</hi> that made
it larger than it was, by adding thereto that part, which is called <hi>Strelitzagorod,</hi> so called
from the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Muskettiers, who are quartered therein. The City is eight thousand
Geometrical feet about; and that side towards the River, which, in that place, is two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
two hundred and sixteen foot broad, affords a pleasant Prospect, by reason of the great
number of Turrets and Steeples of stone, which look very delightfully at a distance, but within,
it is not answerable thereto, the Houses being all of Wood, and not well built. Some told us,
that there were in the City above 500 great Pieces of brass, and among others, many Mortar-pieces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Garrison consisted of nine <hi>Pricasses,</hi> or Regiments, in each of which were 500 Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
under the command of two <hi>Weywodes,</hi> one <hi>Diak,</hi> and several Captains, and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
who have an eye upon the <hi>Tartars,</hi> whom they have reason to be distrustful
of.</p>
                  <p>This City being seated upon the Frontiers of two of the most considerable parts of the world,
it may well be, that not only the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Chrim, Precop, Bugar,</hi> and <hi>Nagaia,</hi> and the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
but also the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> (who are Christians) nay the <hi>Indians</hi> trade thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and these last have a particular market-place there for themselves. All which improves
the Commerce of the City, so that the Customs, which there are very low, amount to above
25000 Crowns a year.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of the Country, who are the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Crim</hi> and <hi>Nagaia,</hi> are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to live within the City, but are thrust into a place without the City, which is hedg'd and
palizadoed, or forc'd to live in Huts, which they set up and down, in the open Fields, because
they are not suffer'd to build Cities, nor to fortify their Towns nor Villages with walls. Their
Huts are made either with Bull-rushes or Canes, being about twelve foot diameter, round, and
towards the top, like the Coops wherein Chickens are kept in <hi>Europe.</hi> In the midst of that
place, which serves them for a Roof, there is a hole, through which goes out a stick, having
at the end a piece of coarse Cloath, which they turn to the Wind, to facilitate the going out
of the Smoak, and which they draw in, when the Turf, or Cow-dung, which they burn, is
reduc'd to a live-Coal or Ashes. When the weather is very cold, they put over the Hut a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of coarse Cloath, whereby they so keep in the heat, that they pass over whole days
without stirring out, with their Wives and Children, not feeling any inconvenience. They
have no fixt habitation in the Summer-time, but stay in those places where they find the best
Pasture for their Cattel. When that begins to fail, they put their Huts into Carts, and their
Wives, Children, and Goods upon Camels, Oxen, and Horses, and so they ramble up
and down the Country, whence it comes that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> call them <hi>Poloutski,</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of Winter they all come near and about <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and lodge themselves in
several crews or troops, which lye not at so great a distance but that they can relieve one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against the <hi>Malmukes Tartars,</hi> otherwise called the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Buchar,</hi> their common and
irreconcilable enemies, who make their incursions up and down the Country, from <hi>Astrachan</hi>
and the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, as far as <hi>Sorat of.</hi> The <hi>Tartars</hi> who live near the river <hi>Iaika</hi> are their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors
on the other side, disturbing their quiet by continual Alarms, when the river is fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen.
Whence it comes, that the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> to prevent their being ruin'd by the incursions of
those people, furnish them with Arms, out of the Great Duke's Magazine, whether they are
oblig'd to return them, as soon as the River and the ways are thaw'd: for they are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have any, either defensive or offensive Arms in the Summer.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, they do not pay the Great Duke any Taxes or impositions, but are oblig'd
to serve him against his Enemies, which they do the more gladly, and without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,
out of the hope of booty, as do also those of <hi>Daguestan,</hi> whom we shall speak of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Tartars</hi> have Princes of their own, as also Commanders in time of War, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Judges of their own Nation: but lest they should do any thing contrary to their allegiance
to the Great Duke, there are always some of their <hi>Myrses,</hi> or Princes, kept as Hostages in
the Castle of <hi>Astrachan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:47786:92"/>
The <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Nagaia</hi> and <hi>Chrim,</hi> are for the most part of little stature, and fat, having
large faces and little eyes, and being of an Olive-colour. The men have ordinarily as many
wrinkles in their faces as old Women, little beard, and the head all shaven.</p>
                  <p>All they have about them is a <hi>Casaque,</hi> or Garment of a coarse grey Cloath, upon which
those of <hi>Nagaia</hi> wear for the most part a loose Mantle of black Sheep-kin, with a Cap of the
same stuff, the Wool-side outward. The Women, who are not unhandsom, are commonly
clad in white linnen Cloath, and have about their heads a Coif of the same stuff, folded, and
round, like those pots which some make use of in the Wars, having in the middle a hole, fit to
put a plume of feathers in. Upon this Coif, and on both sides, there hang a great many <hi>Copecs,</hi>
or <hi>Muscovian</hi> Pence.</p>
                  <p>They many times vow their first-born, or some one of their other Children, to God, or some
<hi>Imam,</hi> or Saint. And that these <hi>Nazarites</hi> may be distinguish'd from others, if it be a Girl,
she wears a Ring with a Ruby, a Turqueze stone, or Coral in the Nostril; If a Boy, he wears
it in his right ear. The <hi>Persians</hi> have the same custom; but of that more at large hereafter
Children go stark naked, and are all big-belly'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> live upon what their Cattel, their hunting and fishing supplies them with. Their
Cattel are large and fair, as that of <hi>Poland.</hi> Their sheep, as also those of <hi>Persia,</hi> have great
tayls, which are all fat, weighing 20. or 30. pounds, the ears hanging down as our Spaniels,
flat-nosed. Their Horses are little and mishapen, but strong and hardy. They have some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,
but they have most of them two bunches on their backs, which they call <hi>Buggur,</hi> those
which have but one, and by them called <hi>Towe,</hi> are very scarce among them.</p>
                  <p>Their ordinary food is fish dry'd in the Sun,<note place="margin">Their food<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> which serves them instead of bread. They have
also certain Cakes made of Meal, Rice, and Millet, fry'd in Oyl or Honey. They eat Camels
and Horse-flesh, and drink water and milk. Mares milk they much esteem; with this they treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Ambassadors, when we gave them a Visit, taking it out of a nasty Leather-bag, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it to us.</p>
                  <p>They are for the most part <hi>Mahumetans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Sect, hating that of the
<hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>
Some have made profession of the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Religion, and have been baptiz'd.
They receiv'd us civilly, at least as far as that Nation is capable of civility. One of their Princes
would have given the Ambassadors the divertisement of Hawking, but the <hi>Weywode</hi> would not
permit it.</p>
                  <p>The time we stay'd at <hi>Astrachan</hi> was spent in providing all things necessary for the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Voyage. The <hi>Persians</hi> of the <hi>Caravanne,</hi> and the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince sent often some
of their people to complement us; they also made us Presents, and came in pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For, we had hardly cast Anchor before <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and made known our arrival by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of the great Guns, but the <hi>Cuptzi,</hi> and the other <hi>Persian</hi> Merchants, who were there
but a little before us, sent us a noble Present of all sorts of fruit, <hi>Arpus's,</hi> Melons, Apples,
Apricocks, Peaches, and Grapes, with this excuse, that being, as we were, strangers in the
Countrey, they could make us no better Presents, but when we were come to <hi>Persia,</hi> they
would be absolutely at our disposal. The Ambassadors having answer'd this civility, sent
them, as also to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince, some of all sorts of distill'd waters, and sweet

the water; nay one of their Merchants, an aged man, falling fast asleep upon the Deck, stay'd
there all night. This good man was so kind in his Wine, that taking a glass of <hi>French</hi>-wine
from one of the Ambassadors who had drunk to him, and perceiving they made him this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
that, after the excellent Wines of his own Countrey, he could not taste those of ours,
he made answer, that, though it were poyson, yet coming from the Ambassadors hand, he
would take it off.</p>

How the <hi>Persians</hi> preserve it shall be said hereafter. Many of the <hi>Cuptzi</hi>'s Domesticks came also
to see us, and brought along with them some Mariners, who were astonish'd at the bigness of
our ship, and said all, that it would not be fit for the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, whereof the high, and in a
manner contiguous Waves, would overwhelm it, and there was a necessity of taking down the
Masts. They all affirm'd, that the <hi>Culsum</hi> (so they call the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea) had never born so
great a ship; which yet they only said in comparison of their own, which are only little Barks,

or cast Anchor: but commonly they go within Pistol-shot of the shore.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> having left us, the Ambassadors sent to the Chief <hi>Weywode,</hi> whose name was

for the continuation of their Voyage, and to know whether we should prosecute it by Sea

his birth: for he had a very good countenance, a very clear complexion, and black hair, being
about 28 years of age, of an excellent good humour, and eloquent. He was receiv'd into the

entreated us to give theirs leave to come in, which consisted of Hawboyes and Timbrels. Their
Timbrels were made of earth, and were not much unlike our Butter-pots, making a very
strange noise, though their playing on them was very regular and well carried on. The Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had put them into so good an humour, that in their return we could hear their Musick, nay a
good while after they were got into the City.</p>
                  <p>The 22.<note place="margin">The Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wodes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents.</note> The <hi>Weywode</hi> sent his Presents to the Ambassadors, which consisted in twenty Flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Bacon, twelve large Fishes that had been hung up in the smoak, a Barrel of Cavayar, a
Tun of Beer, and another of Hydromel. About noon, there came aboard us two of the <hi>Polish</hi>
Ambassadors Servants, whom the <hi>Cuptzi</hi> had spoken of, to complement the Ambassadors in
their Master's name, and on the behalf of the Ambassador, sent from the King of <hi>Persia</hi> to the
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> bringing along with them a bottle of <hi>Scherab,</hi> or <hi>Persian</hi> Wine. The <hi>Polish</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
was a <hi>Iacobin</hi> Frier, named <hi>Iohn de Lucca;</hi> and the <hi>Persian,</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> Archbishop,
named <hi>Augustinus Basecius.</hi> The persons sent to us were two <hi>Capuchins,</hi> one an <hi>Italian,</hi> the
other a <hi>French</hi>-man. They told us they had been five moneths at <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and complain'd
much of the ill treatment they had receiv'd there, in that they were detain'd as Prisoners, and
not permitted to go any farther.</p>
                  <p>The same day, the Ambassadors acquainted the <hi>Weywode</hi> with their desire to Visit the <hi>Tartar</hi>-Prince,
entreating him, to that end, to accommodate them with horses for themselves, and
some of their retinue; which he very civilly did, sending the next day, by his Gentleman of the
horse, to the River-side, the number of horses we desired.</p>
                  <p>Being come to a Lodging prepar'd for us without the City,<note place="margin">The Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>-Prince</note> and having acquainted the <hi>Tartar</hi>-Prince
with our arrival, we walk'd towards his Lodging, where he expected us. The Prince
having notice of it, met them in the Court, where he receiv'd the Ambassadors very civilly,
and conducted them to a Chamber richly hung. There were with them the <hi>Poslanick, Alexei,</hi>
and a <hi>Tartar</hi> Ambassador of <hi>Chrim.</hi> The Collation was Magnificent, and of the noblest fruits
in the Countrey, in great plenty. Our drink was Wine, Beer, Hydromel, and Aquavitae, of
all enough: the Trumpets, which the <hi>Weywode</hi> had lent him, sounding in the mean time, and
other Musick playing. When he drunk the Great Duke's and his Highness our Master's health,
he stood, and presented the Cup with his own hand, to all the retinue, even to the Pages. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexei</hi>
in the mean time told us Miracles of the birth and noble endowments of <hi>Mussal,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to perswade us, that he was not to be ranked among the other <hi>Myrses,</hi> or Princes of
<hi>Tartary,</hi> but that he was to be consider'd as a very great Prince, and Nephew to <hi>Knez Iuan
Borissouits Circaski,</hi> being his brother's son, one of the greatest Lords of the great Duke's
Court. He told us, that, when he did homage, the <hi>Czaar</hi> had done him very particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and made him considerable Presents: that he had a Brother at Court, a great Favorite:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47786:93"/>
that his Sister was to marry the King of <hi>Persia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1636.</note> and that he might serve us in both
Kingdoms.</p>

                     </note> after which the Ambassadors would have gone
to see the Habitations of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> without the City; but the <hi>Muscovites</hi> very barbarously
shut the Gates against them, which oblig'd us to return to the ship.</p>
                  <p>The 24. The <hi>Poslanick, Alexei,</hi> gave the Ambassadors a Visit, upon his own accompt. He
was kindly receiv'd, and after he had been Magnificently treated at Dinner, we sent him back to
his Lodging, attended by twelve persons of our retinue, who had each of them a Sable skin.
This <hi>Muscovite,</hi> who might be about 50. years of age, was an ingenious man, and had a great
inclination to Learning, contrary to the ordinary humour of those of his Nation. He had learnt
some few Latine words, and was a Lover of the Mathematicks, whence it came that he Courted
our Conversation, in order to the advancement of his studies. He was so sedulous, that in the
space of five moneths, that we were in company together, both in <hi>Persia</hi> and by the way, he
made such a Progress therein, that he could express himself well enough to be understood in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
'Tis true, 'twas not with the Congruity requisite, but what he had was very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in a <hi>Muscovite.</hi> He learnt also the use of the Astrolabe, as well to take the height of the Sun,
and find out the time of the day, as to make use of it in Geometry. He had one made by our
Clock maker; and as soon as he came to any City or Village, he went out into the Street, to
take the Elevation of the Pole; which the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> not accustom'd to see their Countrey-men
employ'd in those exercises, thought very strange.</p>
                  <p>The 25.<note place="margin">The <hi>Cupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi</hi>'s Feasts.</note> The <hi>Cuptzi</hi> sent to invite the Ambassadors to a feast the next day, and desir'd them
to send him the name and titles of his Highness, our Master, as also the names and qualities of
the Ambassadors, that he might send them by an express to the <hi>Chan,</hi> or Governour of <hi>Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machie</hi>
in <hi>Media,</hi> that when we came to the Frontiers of <hi>Persia,</hi> we might find all things ready
for the prosecution of our Voyage.</p>
                  <p>The 26. He sent seven Horses to the River-side for the Ambassadors and their retinue, but
they made use only of two, and, causing the rest to be led, they ordered the Gentlemen and
Officers to walk a foot, according to the custom in <hi>Germany.</hi> He had prepar'd the Feast in a
great house, which, to that end, he had borrow'd of the <hi>Weywode,</hi> and over against it, he had
hir'd another Lodging, where he had erected a Theater cover'd with <hi>Persian</hi> Tapistry, for the
Timbrels and Hawboyes, who continu'd their Musick from our arrival to our departure.</p>
                  <p>The house where the Feast was kept, was all cover'd with <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Tapistry.
The <hi>Cuptzi</hi> met the Ambassadors in the Court, receiv'd them with great civility, and conducted
them through two Chambers hung all about, into a third, which was hung with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Brocadoe.</p>
                  <p>In all the Chambers, there were Tables and Seats cover'd with the best <hi>Persian</hi> Tapistry,
which the <hi>Cuptzi</hi> had done purposely for our convenience, knowing we were not yet accustomed
to the mode of <hi>Persia,</hi> where they sit upon the ground to eat. The Tables were loaden with all
sorts of Fruits and Preserves, as Grapes, Apples, Melons, Peaches, Apricocks, Almonds, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins
of the Sun, whereof some were little and without stones, Kernels of Nuts, Pistachoes, and
several <hi>Indian</hi> fruits, preserv'd in Sugar and Honey, and over them were large pieces of Satin
or Taffata.</p>
                  <p>We were hardly set, ere came in the two Ambassadors of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> who had upon
their ordinary Habits, the Vestiments which the King of <hi>Persia</hi> had presented them with, and
the <hi>Iacobin</hi> Frier had a Golden Cross upon his breast as well as the <hi>Armenian</hi> Bishop. They
took their places next the Ambassadors, and being well skill'd in the <hi>Latine, Spanish, Italian,</hi>
and <hi>French</hi> Languages, their discourses were accordingly without any trouble, and full of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the custome of <hi>Persia</hi> to begin their Feasts with Fruits and Preserves. We spent two
hours in eating only those, and drinking Beer, Hydromel and Aquavitae. Then was brought up
the meat in great Silver Dishes. They were full of Rice of divers colours, and, upon that, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
sorts of Meat boil'd and roasted, as Beef, Mutton, tame Fowl, wild Ducks, Fish and other
things, all very well ordered, and very delicate.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> use no knives at Table, but the Cooks send up the meat ready cut into little
bits; so that it was no trouble to us to accustome our selves to their manner of eating. Rice
serves them instead of bread. They take a mouthfull of it, with the two fore-fingers, and the
thumb, and so put it into their mouths. Every Table had a Carver, whom they call <hi>Suffretzi,</hi>
who takes the meat brought up in the great Dishes, to put it into lesser ones, which he fills with
three or four sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of meat, so as that every Dish may serve two, or, at most, three persons.
There was but little drunk till towards the end of the repast, and then the Cups went about
roundly, and the Dinner was concluded with a Vessel of Porcelane, full of a hot blackish kind of
drink, which they call <hi>Kahawa,</hi> whereof we shall have occasion to say more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> express'd their civility towards us so highly, both in word and deed, at this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> we could not have desir'd more in our own Country. Having taken leave both of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47786:94"/>
our Entertainer, the Ambassadors of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> and the rest of the Company, which
was done with much honour and civility on all sides, we drew off with the noise of the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels
and Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>boyes, which sounded a retreat, after a very pleasant manner. Two of the most
considerable of the Company brought us to the City Gate, where they renew'd their civilities,
and acknowledg'd the honour the Ambassadors had done them, and re-assur'd us of their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and services. As the Ambassadors went into the Shallop, some of the Ship Guns were fired,
which had also been done when they went out of it to go to the Feast.</p>
                  <p>The 27. the Ambassadors, with some few persons about them, took a walk, and having
gone about the City, they went a league farther to see the habitations of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> We
found by the way, that, in those parts, Oxen and Horses tread out the Corn, whereas in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places it is thrash'd; whereby we explain'd that Law, which forbids muzzling the Oxe
that treadeth out the Corn. No Hut but had its Hawk or Faulcon; in our return we met with
one of their Princes coming from his sport,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> much given to Hawking.</note> having his Hawk on his fist, and a Sheep-skin on
his back, as all the rest had. He exprest his trouble that he had not been at home to entertain the
Ambassadors.</p>
                  <p>The same day went thence the <hi>Poslanick Alexei Sawinouits,</hi> continuing his Voyage to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>
by the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea.</p>

<hi>Persian</hi> Merchant, namely, <hi>Noureddin Mahumed,</hi> save that the Stage, or Theater, for
the <hi>Muscovians,</hi> was erected in the Court, opposite to the Table, but more richly adorn'd
than that of the <hi>Cuptzi.</hi> He had also invited the Religious Men before spoken of, certain <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and two <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who came from the <hi>Weywode,</hi> and understood the Language. The

against the <hi>Muscovites:</hi> whereupon the former fearing it might reflect on them, as being
the Masters of the Entertainment, entreated the Ambassador not to engage into any further
discourse concerning publike Affairs, but to be merry, and to assure himself, that the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
they then made us of their affection, were but slight earnests of the friendship we were to
expect from them after our arrival into <hi>Persia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 29.<note place="margin">Another <hi>Tartar</hi>-Prince visits the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.

returning from his sport. He made us a present of some wild Geese, which he had taken,
and invited us to go along with him a-Hawking the next day, which we had accepted, but the
<hi>Weywode</hi> would not permit it, as we said before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Septemb.</hi> the last, the <hi>Weywode</hi> sent us a Present of some of the Country Preserves; to wit,
Ginger-bread, and the juyce of Goosberies reduc'd to a Past, whereof some was dispos'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the form of great Cheeses, some flat, and some in Rolls. It was, in taste, somewhat sharp
and picquant, and not unpleasant. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> put of this kind of paste into most of their
sawces.</p>

                     <hi>October</hi> the first,<note place="margin">OCTOB.</note> the Secretary of the Embassy, with two other Officers of the retinue, were
ordered to go to the <hi>Weywode</hi> about some business. He receiv'd me with much civility, made
me set down by him, and gave me a very favourable audience. But before he answer'd the
Proposions we had made to him, he made great complaint of the unhandsome treatment, which
<hi>Rodivon,</hi> our <hi>Pristaf,</hi> whom the Great Duke had order'd to conduct us as far as <hi>Astrachan,</hi>
had received from the Ambassador <hi>Brugman.</hi> He had given him very uncivil language, and had
call'd him <hi>Bledinsin, Sabak,</hi> &amp;c. never considering that he was employ'd by the Great Duke.
He told us further, that, to his knowledge, the <hi>Pristaf</hi> was a person of honour, and prudent
in the management of his charge: but that it was a great indiscretion in the Ambassador to
treat him after that rate, though <hi>Rodivon</hi> had not done his duty, and that he should rather
have made his complaints of him to his <hi>Czaarick</hi> Majesty, or at least to those who represent the
Prince's Person at <hi>Astrachan,</hi> of whom he might have expected satisfaction: That he could
not believe the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> would take it well, no more than the Great Duke, that any
publick Officer of his Country should be treated in that manner: That he was oblig'd by the
concernment of his charge to make those remonstrances to us, but, that there was not, on the
other side, any reason the whole retinue should suffer for his mis-carriage, and that
that should not hinder him from giving us a speedy dispatch; as indeed he immediately
did.</p>
                  <p>The dayes following were spent in carrying aboard the Provisions which we had bought,<note place="margin">Provisions for the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Voyage.</note> for
the prosecution of our Voyage. Our own people had bak'd Bread and Bisket, and had brew'd
a certain quantity of Beer. We had bought of the <hi>Tartars</hi> twenty fat Oxen, at between eight
and fourteen Crowns a piece, as also several Barrels of Salt-fish, intending to go to Sea with the
first opportunity. And in regard we knew not what kind of sayling it was on the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea,
and that it was represented to us as very dangerous, by reason of the shallowness of the <hi>Wolga</hi>
thereabouts, for several leagues together, besides our <hi>Muscovian</hi> Pilot, we hired certain <hi>Tartars</hi>
of the Country, who promis'd to go before us in a Boat, and to bring our ship into the main Sea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:47786:94"/>
Accordingly, <hi>Oct.</hi> 10. we left <hi>Astrachan,</hi>

                     </note> about noon, having very fair weather, taking our
course towards South, and South-west. But we had not got a league, ere a contrary wind
rising forc'd us to the shore, and kept us there all that day, and the next. We there receiv'd
the visit of a certain <hi>Myrsa,</hi> or <hi>Tartar</hi>-Prince, a very handsome graceful person, and one of
the most considerable in those parts, who presented us with a Mutton, and a Barrel of Milk.</p>
                  <p>We observ'd that near <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and for the most part all along the River <hi>Wolga,</hi> the
Earth produc'd Simples in great abundance,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Simples</hi> of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> and of incredible bigness. The Herb, which
the Latins call <hi>Esula,</hi> grew there as high as a Man, and the Root of <hi>Angelica</hi> was as big as a
Man's arm.</p>
                  <p>The Tempest being over, the 12. we set forward, but could get but a league that day. We
got not much more the 13. and were forc'd to cast Anchor near a little round Mountain, on our
left hand, 15. <hi>werstes</hi> from <hi>Astrachan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Muscovites</hi> call this mountain <hi>Tomanoi-gor.</hi> We gave it the name of the <hi>Snakie Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Snakes.</note>
by reason of the abundance of Serpents we met with there. It was full of Caper-trees,
and had abundance of the Herb called <hi>Semper-vivum,</hi> of several kinds, as Sea-house-leek, Prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madame,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Plain, which is at the foot of this Hill, affords one of the most delightful
Prospects of the World, and that for several leagues together. At night, we saw in a Boat the
<hi>Strelits</hi> who had convoy'd the <hi>Poslanick,</hi> as far as <hi>Terki.</hi> They told us there was no danger
in our way, and that they had come it in 24. hours.</p>
                  <p>The 14. the wind North-north-east, we continu'd our Voyage, and came in the afternoon
over against a Chapel called <hi>Zuantzuk, 30. werstes</hi> from <hi>Astrachan.</hi> Hereabouts is the best
fishing in the Country; The <hi>Tartars</hi> call it <hi>Vtschu,</hi> and it belongs to the Convent of <hi>Troitza,</hi>
or of the Trinity, at <hi>Astrachan.</hi> The River <hi>Wolga,</hi> in this place, divided into several Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
making so many Isles, which are covered all over with Bushes, Canes, and Ozier, as is
also the Coast of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, as far as the River <hi>Koisu.</hi> There is, among the rest, one Isle
named <hi>Perul, 15. werstes</hi> from <hi>Vtschu,</hi> in which we saw a house built of wood, of a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
height: having on the roof of it a long pole with a Sheep's skull at the top of it, and we
were told it was the Sepulchre of a <hi>Tartarian</hi> Saint, near which the Inhabitants, as also some
among the <hi>Persians,</hi> when they either take a Voyage, or are safely return'd home, sacrifice a
Sheep, part whereof serves for the Sacrifice, the rest for a Feast after the Sacrifice. Having
ended their Prayers and Devotions, the Sheep's head is put on the top of the pole, where it is left,
till it be either reliev'd by another, or fall off of it self. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> call this place <hi>Tataski
Molobitza,</hi> that is to say, The Sacrifice of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> Behind this Isle, on the left hand,
there were, upon a high, but very smooth ascent, a great number of Hutts.</p>
                  <p>At night we came to another Fishing-place, 15. <hi>werstes</hi> from the Sea, where the River is
shut in with a Palizadoe, and kept by a hundred <hi>Muscovian</hi> Musketiers, who keep a guard there
against the <hi>Cosaque</hi> Pirates. In this place we saw a great number of Dog-fishes, or Sea-hounds,
as also of that kind of Fowl which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Onocratalus,</hi> whose Beaks are long, round, and
flat at the extremity, as a Spoon beaten out. Putting its Beak into the water, it makes a noise
not much unlike that of an Ass, whence it hath the name: but particularly we took notice of a
kind of Geese, or rather Cormorants, whereof we made mention before. The <hi>Muscovites</hi>
call them <hi>Babbes,</hi> the <hi>Persians, Kuthum,</hi> and the <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Guiny, Bombu.</hi> As to their feet,
leggs, neck, and colour, they are like other Geese, but they are bigger in body than Swans.
Their Bills are above a foot and a half long, and two fingers broad, and forked at the end.
Under their Bills, they have a great bag of shrivell'd skin, which they can dilate so, as that it
is able to contain near three Gallons of liquor, and they make use of it as a reservatory for the
fish they take, till such time as they can swallow them down. For their throats are so wide,
that people are not only oblig'd to shut them, when they make use of these Birds in fishing, as
they often do, but also, if we believe <hi>Franciscus Sanctius,</hi> it was discover'd, that one of these
Birds, which was taken upon its having overcharg'd the said bag, had swallow'd down a <hi>Moor</hi>-child
upon the Coasts of <hi>Africk.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi> are very expert in dressing the skins of them,
and making Tabours thereof, or covering therewith some other Musical Instruments. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
<hi>Crusius</hi> kill'd one of them upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea side, which was above two ells and a
half between the extremities of the Wings, and above seven foot from the head to the feet.
<hi>Franciscus Fernandez,</hi> in his <hi>History of the living-Creatures and Plants of Mexico,</hi> sayes, that,
in those parts, there are some that have teeth within their Bills; but we are not to go out of
<hi>Africa</hi> into <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We saw hereabouts another kind of Bird, much after the form of wild Ducks, save that they
are somewhat bigger, and black as Crows, and have longer necks, and the end of their bills

                  <p>The 15. we came to the mouth of the River <hi>Wolga,</hi> and the entrance into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea,
which is 12. leagues from <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and full of small Islands, covered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47786:95"/>
are Islands thereabouts; but they are mistaken, for those Islands are to be accompted rather
made by the Sea, than the River.</p>
                  <p>The bottome is all muddy, having but between four, or four foot and a half water, which
put us to inexpressible trouble, and took up our time so, as that we hardly got four leagues in
seven dayes. Our worst dayes were the 18. and 19. of <hi>October.</hi> The 18. we were got on a
Bank, at five foot water, and having spent as many hours in getting off, we found indeed six
foot water, but soon discover'd that it was only a pit, which of all sides, had Banks, at four and
four foot and a half water.</p>
                  <p>Having, with no less trouble, got again to the Bank where we had five foot water, the wind
being turn'd to the North-west, the water fell so sensibly, that we had but three foot, the
Ship being as it were fasten'd in the mud. We unloaded part of our Provisions into the <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Boat that went before us, and set all our people on work, to get off; but though they
took incredible pains, so as that they had not the leasure either to eat or drink, yet could they
do no good, so that all could be done was patiently to expect the return of the water, which
we could not hope for but with the change of the wind. This was no small affliction to those,
who consider'd that we were there at the mercy of the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> who might easily have taken us
prisoners, and forc'd us to ransome our selves. With all these misfortunes there happen'd to be
such a thick mist, that we could not see from one end of the Ship to the other, and occasion'd a
great oversight in us, by firing a great Gun, according to the order of the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi>
at a <hi>Muscovian</hi> Boat that pass'd somewhat near our Ship: Those who were in the Boat return'd
us their curses, and told us, that they might as freely pass that way, as we, who were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and went by the Great Duke's permission, whom we were oblig'd to acknowledge for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
of that Sea, and their Prince; that since we were so much given to shooting, we might
keep our powder to be us'd against the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> who not far thence expected us. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
caus'd two other Boats to fare the better, and our selves also, for, instead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
speeches, they sent us some of the fruits of <hi>Circassia,</hi> to wit, an excellent kind of Pears,
Nuts, and Medlars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oct.</hi> 21. at night, we first perceiv'd that the water was risen to five foot, which begat in us a
hope, that we might put off to Sea. The Tempest, which rose the 22. with a South-south-east<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
brought it up to nine foot; but it was so violent, that not daring to make use of our
Sails, we were forc'd to continue still at Anchor, and expect fairer weather, which came not till
five dayes after.</p>
                  <p>The 23. in the morning, the sky being clear, I observ'd the Sun at its rising, and found, that,
in respect of the Compass, it rose 22. degrees more towards the South than it should, by which
means we discover'd, that, in that place, the needle declin'd 22. degrees from the North, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the West.</p>
                  <p>The 27. the Tempest being over, we return'd all our things into the Ship, and dismiss'd our
Boat, and, having hoised Sail, got into the Sea; but we hardly made a league, ere we were
again in the mud, and oblig'd to send for the Boat. But perceiving we had water enough, the
28. and seeing thirteen Sail behind us coming out of the <hi>Wolga,</hi> whom we conceiv'd to be the
<hi>Caravan,</hi> we order'd the Boat to be sent back. It was the <hi>Tartar</hi>-Prince, two Merchants of
<hi>Persia,</hi> and five hundred <hi>Muscovian</hi> Musketiers, with their Colonel, who were going to relieve
the Garrison of <hi>Terki:</hi> but what put us most to a loss, was, that, finding the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Pilot,
whom we had taken up at <hi>Astrachan,</hi> absolutely ignorant in the business of Navigation; and
the Maps, by which we intended to direct our course, absolutely false, we knew not what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to take.</p>
                  <p>We resolv'd at last to address our selves to the Officer that commanded the 500. Musketiers,
and to send to him in the evening, while all the ships lay at Anchor, to entreat his assistance and
advice in that conjuncture, and to desire him to give us an able man that might be our Pilot on
the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. He came aboard us, and having drunk sufficiently, he made us the greatest
protestations of friendship in the World, and told us, that the trouble it was to him to see us
in those difficulties had bereft him of his sleep; that his joy to find us in good health was so
much the more extraordinary, and that he would not fail to send the <hi>Weywode</hi> notice of it by an
express Messenger; that all under his Command were at our service, and that as soon as he were
got aboard,<note place="margin">A <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Slurr.</note> he would send us a Pilot we might confide in. But the merry Companion was no
sooner got to his own ship, but he set sayl, and left us in the lurch. I think, what troubled
him was, that we had not made him some present according to the custom of the Countrey;
but he regarded so little the slur he had put upon the Ambassadors, that he had the impudence to
come and Visit them in their ship, in the company of several other <hi>Tartarian</hi> Lords, after our
arrival at <hi>Terki,</hi> and made no other answer to the reproaches he receiv'd upon that occasion, than,
<hi>ja wi nouat,</hi> a great business indeed to be talk'd of.</p>
                  <p>Finding our selves thus abus'd,<note place="margin">The civility of a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Pilot.</note> we sent to the Master of the <hi>Persian</hi> ship, to entreat his assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
He, though Mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> of the ship, and owner of all the goods in it, came aboard us, to prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
us his service as a Pilot, with more kindness and civility than we could have expected from a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47786:95"/>
                     <hi>Christian,</hi> and, having recommended his own ship to his servants, stay'd with us. He was a
very understanding man, and was not only acquainted with the Navigation of those parts, but
also with the Compass, much beyond what the <hi>Persians</hi> ordinarily are vers'd in, who do not
willingly venture very far into the Sea, but for the most part keep in sight of Land. So that
finding the wind serv'd,<note place="margin">An omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous day.</note> he caus'd the Anchor to be weigh'd, about eleven at night, taking his
course towards the South, with an East wind. We observ'd it was the same day that we left
<hi>Travemunde</hi> the year before, and accordingly we had the same success in this second Voyage.
We had all that night but ten foot water; but towards day, we had eighteen. The Countrey
on our right hand, which is called <hi>Suchator,</hi> had four Hills, which made a great Promontory,
reaching a great way into the Sea; and from that Cape to <hi>Astrachan</hi> are counted 100 <hi>werstes,</hi>
and to <hi>Terki</hi> 200. but on both sides they are very short ones.</p>
                  <p>The 29. The weather fair, we kept on our course, in the morning Southward, and with a
South-East wind, and in the afternoon, South-west-ward, having about twenty foot water,
and finding the bottom gravelly, and full of little shells. We could discover no Land that day,
and the night following, we cast Anchor. Here the Needle declin'd twenty degrees, from North
to West.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 30. We set sayl at the break of day, and soon after Sun-rising, we discover'd the
Countrey of <hi>Circassia,</hi> which lies all along the Sea-Coast from the South-West, to
North-East, compassing it about, much after the form of a Crescent, and making a spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Bay.</p>
                  <p>It was our design, to get beyond the point of the Gulf, but the wind coming to South-East,
had almost forc'd us into it, which oblig'd us to cast Anchor about noon, at the entrance of the
Gulf, at three fathom and a half water, finding at the bottom a kind of fat earth, about six
Leagues from <hi>Terki.</hi> We discover'd in the Bay, about 20. or twenty five Boats, and upon the
first sight thereof, it run into our imagination, that they were the <hi>Cosaques;</hi> but we were soon
undeceiv'd, and found them to be <hi>Tartarian</hi> Fisher-men, belonging to <hi>Terki,</hi> and were then
coming to bring us fish to sell. For those we bought of them, we gave them fifteen pence a
piece, but they were very great ones, and we found in their bellies a great number of Crabs and
Lobsters, among which there were some alive.</p>
                  <p>The remainder of the day we spent in giving Almighty God solemn thanks, for all his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
deliverances of us, particularly that which happen'd on the very same day the year before,
when we were in so great danger, amidst the Rocks and Shelves of <hi>Ocland.</hi> Our <hi>Persian</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
went that day to his own ship, which was at some distance behind us, to give his men Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what they should do, leaving us somewhat of an opinion, that he would shew us such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trirk as the <hi>Muscovite</hi> had done before: but he afterwards made it appear, that those
of his Nation are not only made up of Complements, for he return'd very betimes the next
morning, having sent his Boat before us, to serve us for a Guide.</p>
                  <p>The last day of <hi>October,</hi> we had, in the morning, a thick Mist, with a great Calm. The Sun
having dispell'd the one about noon, and the wind being come to the North, we endeavour'd to
get out of the Gulf, and with much ado, by laveering, got the point, near which we stayd at
Anchor till after midnight, and came very betimes in the morning,<note place="margin">NOVEM<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> on the first of <hi>November,</hi>
before the City of <hi>Terki.</hi> We cast Anchor about a quarter of a League from the City, because
we could not come any nearer, by reason of the shallowness of the water. The night before,
the <hi>Cosaques</hi> had a design to set upon us, but happily miss'd us in the dark, and met with the
little Fleet which brought the <hi>Tartar</hi>-Prince; but the noise of the <hi>Strelits</hi> or <hi>Muscovian</hi> Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers
having discover'd to them that they were mistaken, and imagining they should find a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
resistance, they drew back, but made it appear they were the <hi>Germans</hi> that they look'd
for.</p>
                  <p>Intelligence coming, in the morning, to the City, of this attempt of the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> rais'd a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hot Alarm there, in regard it was known that <hi>Mussal</hi> their Prince was coming, and that he
might be in some danger. The Inhabitants were confirm'd in that opinion, when they heard the
going off of our great Guns, a noise they are not accustomed to in those parts; insomuch that
they began to get together, and look on us as Enemies; but they were put out of all fear by
the arrival of their Prince, who having given us a Volley as he pass'd by, and invited us to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him with a Visit at his Mother's, satisfy'd the Inhabitants, that there was no danger either
to him or them.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Terki</hi> lies somewhat above half a League from the Sea,<note place="margin">Terki <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</hi>

whether they were resolv'd to prosecute their Voyage by Sea, or would travel by Land, with
this by way of Invitation, that if they would go by Land, there was an opportunity to do it
with all imaginable convenience, in as much as, within three dayes, there was expected at <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki</hi>
a <hi>Muscovian</hi> Ambassador, who was upon his return from <hi>Persia,</hi> and would bring with
him to the Frontiers, two hundred Camels, and a great number of Mules, which might carry
our baggage. To this, it was added, that, by this convenience, we might pass safely through
the Countrey of the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Dagesthan,</hi> and avoid falling into the hands of their <hi>Schemkal,</hi>
or Captain, who was one of the greatest Robbers in the World; and that we might be the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
assur'd there was no danger, they proffer'd us their company in our Travels. This propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
was so well receiv'd by the Ambassadors, that they immediately sent to the <hi>Weywode</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
his permission to take their advantage of this opportunity, and dispatch'd <hi>Rustan,</hi> our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>

prosecution of our Voyage by Land; but being come thither, he found the Camels, and all the
other beasts fit for carriage, were return'd into <hi>Persia.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Weywode</hi> had at first absolutely deny'd us the Liberty of passage; but as soon as he heard
there was no convenience of taking that way, he sent an Officer to tell us, that, though he had
receiv'd no express order from the Great Duke to permit any such thing, yet he would not stick
to grant us passage, and assist us in order thereto what lay in his power.</p>
                  <p>The night following,<note place="margin">A mutiny in the ship.</note> the Mariners, belonging to our ship, fell into a mutiny, against <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael

which way to get out of the ship. They that came along with him were so edify'd by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

of Neeches vaulted, in which there were either rich beds, with coverlets of silk or cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;
or there were layd up in them several pieces of <hi>Persian</hi> Tapestry, and coverlets;

of diverse colours; and the pillars, which underpropp'd the structure, were hung all about
with excellent Cymitars, Quivers, and Arrows. The Princess sat in a chair, having about her a

and might be about 45 years of age. She wore, at her neck behind, an Ox-bladder, blown
to the utmost, which was wound about towards her hair, with a rich Scarf embroider'd with
Gold and Silk, and had about her neck another Scarf, the two ends whereof hung down over
her shoulders. Behind the Chair stood a Lady, who had also a Bladder at her neck, and we
were told afterwards that it was the Badge of Widdowhood. On her right hand stood her
three Sons, the two younger whereof were no better in Cloaths than the most inconsiderable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the Country. Behind them, stood certain Servants, on whose fore-heads and faces
(which they had torn with their nails) might still be seen the marks of their mourning for the
death of the elder brother, who had been executed at <hi>Moscou.</hi> On the left hand stood, all in
a file, several <hi>Tartars,</hi> who were all very aged Persons, and represented the Council and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Court. The Princess, having answer'd our Complement, ordered Seats to be
brought; and a little Table furnish'd with Fruits for the Collation,<note place="margin">The Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> at which our drink was Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromel
and Aquavitae. We would have had the Princes to have sate down with us, but they
would not by any means do it, alledging, that it was not the Custome of the Country, and
that the respect they ought their Mother permitted not their sitting down in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                  <p>The Collation being ended,<note place="margin">The curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the <hi>Tartar</hi>-Ladies.</note> and the Princess and others of the Company having handled and
taken particular notice of our Cloaths all over, the Princess her self presented to each of us, a
large Cup, full of a sort of Aquavitae extracted out of a Millet, which we found as strong as
Spirit of Wine. The three Princes Presented us also with each of them a Cup, and intreated us
not to take it ill, if they did the same honour to our Servants. In the mean time there was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
behind the Princess, a Chamber-door, at the entrance whereof were to be seen several
Ladies, and amongst the rest the Princess's Daughter, who was betroathed to the <hi>Sophy</hi> of
<hi>Persia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She might be about sixteen years of age, and was very handsome, the clearness of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
having so much the greater lustre, by reason of the extraordinary blackness of her hair.
These Ladies seemed to be no less desirous to see our Cloaths, than those who were in the Hall,
thrusting one another towards the door, which they immediately shut upon the least sign made
to them by the Princess: but they opened it again soon after, to take a further view of us. They
call'd one of our servants to them, to take the more particular notice of his Cloaths, the fashion
whereof they very much admir'd, as also that of his Sword, which they desir'd him to draw,
that they might see the blade of it. But the <hi>Persian</hi> Envoy, who every day visited the Princess,
coming into the Room while they were so employ'd, the Chamber door was immediately shut
upon them, and we took leave of the Princess and the Princes her Sons, and went to view the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
We there met with several Women, handsome, young, and well made, having on them a
kind of smocks of frocks of diverse colours, who made no difficulty ever and anon to stay us,
till they had taken particular notice of our Cloaths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 6. The <hi>Cuptzi</hi> sent us a Letter from the Governour of <hi>Derbent,</hi> in answer to that which
he had writ to him from <hi>Astrachan,</hi> the 25 of <hi>Sept.</hi> before. The contents of it was, to express
his joy at our arrival, and to order the <hi>Cuptzi</hi> not to come away without us, but to bring us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him by Sea.</p>
                  <p>The 7. Our Interpreter <hi>Rustan</hi> return'd from the frontiers of <hi>Dagesthan,</hi> with this news,
that those, who had conducted the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Ambassador to the frontiers, were return'd into
<hi>Persia</hi> before his coming thither; and that they thought it not enough to carry away the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels
and all the other Beasts fit for carriage, but they had also taken along with them the pieces
of Timber and Fagots, without which it was impossible to get over those places where the Road
was bad: upon which intelligence it was immediately resolv'd, that we should continue our
Voyage by Sea.</p>
                  <p>The 8. The Princess sent the Ambassadors a present of two Sheep, fifty Pullets, and several
other Provisions. The high Chancellor of <hi>Muscovy</hi> sent us a Sheep, a barrel of Beer, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47786:97"/>
of Hydromel. In the afternoon, the Prince <hi>Mussal</hi> came to give us a visit, to bid us
adieu. There came along with him a <hi>Myrsa</hi> of <hi>Dagesthan,</hi> a Brother of the Prince of <hi>Tarku</hi>'s,
who made us believe, he was come expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s to conduct the Ambassadors as far as the place of his
Brother's residence. He was no better clad than the other <hi>Tartars,</hi> having, over his old cloaths,
a Cloak, of a sort of very coarse Cloath, but as to his corntenance and behaviour, he express'd
a fierceness beyond any of them, not dissembling the trouble it was to him, that we discover'd
a greater respect for <hi>Mussal</hi> than for him, and refusing to stand at the drinking of the Great
Duke's health. And when <hi>Mussal</hi> intreated him to consider the place he was in, he confidently
made answer, that he knew not whether the Country he was then in, were the Great Duke's or
his own, and began to pick a quarrel with him, reproaching him, that, with all his gay
Cloaths, he was but a slave to the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> whereas himself, though but in raggs, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
an absolute Prince; that acknowledg'd no other superiour than God: insomuch that
at last, not able to govern his passion, he absolutely refus'd to drink the <hi>Czaar</hi>'s health in any
posture,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to theft.</note> and went his wayes. Some of his servants stole from our Minister, a silver Spoon and
a Knife, and cut off one of the sleeves of my Doublet; but they were forc'd to leave it behind
them, it being engag'd under some other Cloaths.</p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Mussal</hi> staid with the Ambassadors, and begg'd of them the pardon of the Mariner
whom we had sent Prisoner to <hi>Terki.</hi> The Ambassadors very freely satisfy'd his desire therein,
and so sent late that night, the Secretary of the Embassy and another Gentleman, to the <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode,</hi>
to entreat him to return the Prisoner into our hands, and to desire justice of him against
the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Pilot, who had run away from us two dayes before. A good while after night
a Lacquey was sent after us,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors leave <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki.</hi>
                     </note> to press our immediate return to the Ship, which was then ready
to set sayl, to make all the advantage they could of the Wind, which for some hours had blown
very fair. We had dispatch'd all our business, when the Lacquey came to us; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the expedition we could use, we found the Ship under sayl, but it was not long,
ere the Wind, turning to the direct contrary point, forc'd us to continue in the same
place.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Weywode</hi> in the mean time sent us his Present,<note place="margin">The <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode</hi>'s Present.</note> which consisted of a hundred pieces of hung
Beef, four tuns of Beer, a puncheon of French Wine, a tun of Hydromel, a puncheon of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
two Sheep, four great Cakes of Ginger-bread, and several Loafs of other bread. There
was bestow'd among those that brought the Present, about 20. Crowns, and good store of Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae,
insomuch that they went their way very well satisfy'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 10. the Wind coming to South-west, we set sayl at the break of day, intending to take
the course of the City of <hi>Derbent,</hi> which is the nearest of any of that frontier. About noon,
we discover'd a Bark, which at first, took its course so as if it would have pass'd on the right
hand of us, then made as if she would come up streight to us, and not knowing well what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to take, they ever and anon made more or less sayl; whereby perceiving that those
who were in it, were afraid of us, the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> gave order that the Ship should
make streight towards the Bark, put the Soldiers in their stations, and commanded a certain
number of great Guns to be fir'd at randome, the more to frighten them. The poor people im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
struck sayl, and came near us. They were <hi>Persians,</hi> Fruit-Merchants, and the Bark
was then loaden with Apples, Pears, Quinces, Nuts, and other Fruits. The Master of it, who
was Brother to our Pilot, seeing him among a sort of people such as he had never seen before,
and believing he was their Prisoner, began with horrid Cries and Lamentations to bewail his
Brother's misfortune, as also his own, which he expected to fall into, though he cry'd several
times to him, <hi>Korchma duschman lardekul, Fear not, they are friends, among whom I am with
my own consent.</hi> But the other would hear of no perswasion to the contrary, imagining, that
they forc'd him to speak to that purpose, and could not recover himself out of the fear he was
in, till his Brother had acquainted him with the occasion which had brought him to our Ship.
Then was it that he took the courage to come himself into our Ship, with a present of all sorts
of Autumn-fruits, whereof he also sold good store, so cheap, that a quarter of a hundred of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Apples came not to a penny. He was treated with Aquavitae, after which he return'd
to his Bark very well satisfied.</p>
                  <p>Much about this time, we came near an Isle which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> call <hi>Tzetland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An Island in the <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Sea.</note> and the
<hi>Persians, Tzenzeni,</hi> eight Leagues from <hi>Terki,</hi> on the left hand. There we cast Anchor, at
three fathom and a half water, and staid there four and twenty hours, according to the custom
of the <hi>Pesians.</hi> We had lying before us a Treatise written by <hi>George Dictander,</hi> (who had
Travell'd into <hi>Pesia</hi> in the year 1602. with an Ambassador sent thither by the Emperour <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph</hi>
11.) who, speaking of this Isle, sayes, that, being the only man left alive at his return,
and staid in that place by the cold, he had been forc'd to kill the Horses which the <hi>Sophy</hi> had
bestow'd on him, after he had consum'd all the other Provisions. Having at our coming thither,
four or five hours of day-light remaining, the Ambassadors thought it not amiss to go into the
Island, to see whether what they observ'd there, were consonant to what the other had written
thereof: But all we could meet with worth our Observation was, only three great poles fasten'd
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47786:97"/>
together, and set up at one of the points of the Island, beset all about with Roots and Boughs,
to serve for a direction to the Mariners, and two great Ditches, wherein some time before fire
had been made. This, in all probability was done by the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> who make their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
retreats into that Island. It lies at forty three degrees, five minutes elevation, and reaches
in length from North-east to South-east, about three <hi>German</hi> Leagues. The soil is for the
most part sandy and barren, and towards the extremities, either cover'd with shells, or fenny;
and it is the only Island that is to be seen, as we goe to <hi>Kilan,</hi> West-ward of the ordinary
course.</p>
                  <p>From this Island, there may be seen in the Continent, towards the South-west, such high
Mountains, that we took them at first for Clouds. Our people called them the Mountains of
<hi>Circassia;</hi> but the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> nay the Inhabitants of <hi>Circassia</hi> themselves, call it the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Salatto,</hi> and it is properly that Mountain which the Antients call <hi>Caucasus,</hi>

with Snow on the top, as well in Summer as Winter, by means whereof it is discover'd
fifteen Leagues into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. The <hi>Armenians,</hi> and the <hi>Persians</hi> themselves, are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that there are still upon the said Mountain some remainders of the Ark, but that time
hath so hardned them, that they seem absolutely petrify'd. At <hi>Schamachy</hi> in <hi>Media,</hi> we were
shewn a Cross of a black and hard Wood, which the Inhabitants affirmed to have been made of
the Wood of the Ark: and upon that account it was look'd upon as a most precious Relick, and,
as such, was wrapp'd in Crimson Taffata. The Mountain is now inaccessible, by reason of the
precipices whereby it is encompass'd of all sides.</p>

and whose Territories lye in those parts, in the Country of <hi>Karabah</hi> told us many very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
particulars of it. These high Mountains are a great direction to those who have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
to sail by in the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; in as much as changing their form according to the
several prospects they afford, the Pilots by that means easily discover whereabouts they
are.</p>
                  <p>The 11. we continu'd our Voyage presently after Sun-rising, taking our course along the
Isle Southward. At the extremity of the Isle, there is a kind of Streight, near a Cape or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory
which comes out of the Continent into the Sea, much about the same place, where,
on the Isle side, a great Sand-bank advances it self toward the Land, and so makes but a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
passage. Which oblig'd us to cast Anchor, that we might have the more convenience of
Sounding, so to avoid the flats or shallows, which make Navigation very dangerous therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts.
We found, at first, but two fathom water, but soon after we were at six or seven fathom;
insomuch that the Wind becoming more favourable, we took our course South-South-west,
directly towards <hi>Derbent,</hi> along the shore, and in sight of it. After mid-night, the Wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not so much for us as before, we were forc'd to laveer it all the remainder of the Night;
but we advanc'd little or nothing; insomuch that a Tempest rising thereupon, we at last resolv'd
to cast Anchor, which we did, at twelve fathom water. We lay at Anchor all the <hi>12th.</hi> till 9.
at night, and then the Wind coming to the North, we set sail with a favourable Wind, taking
our course to the South-South-east.</p>
                  <p>About 11. the same night, we found between 20 and thirty fathom water, and an hour after,
no bottom,<note place="margin">A Tempest.</note> so that the wind being turn'd again to an absolute Tempest, we conceiv'd, that it
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47786:98"/>
would be dangerous for us to bear much sail upon a Sea we were not acquainted with, and that
in the Night time, Whereupon having furl'd them up, we let the Ship go directly before the
wind, by which means we got two Leagues in less than an hour. We had, besides our double
Shallop, two other Boats, one whereof, which we had bought of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> was only
for their convenience who sounded the depth of the Water, and the other serv'd for the unload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Ship, which drew both of them after her. There were two Sea-men appointed for
the guiding of the Shallop, which, having in it only certain small Pieces, Bullets, Chains, Cables,
Pitch, and other things necessary for Navigation, was made so shallow, that being ever and
anon fill'd with water, the Sea-men, finding themselves no longer able to guide it, came aboard
the Ship, and fasten'd the Shallop to the stern. The other Boats were soon over-whelm'd with
water and lost. The Shallop held out a while, but at length follow'd the others, and this
prov'd the beginning of our wrack upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. Our Ship, which was built only of
Firr, and had been much endammag'd by the Sand-banks of the <hi>Wolga,</hi> bow'd under the high
and violent waves of that Sea, as if it had been a Snake, and open'd in so many places, that we
were forc'd to be alwayes at the Pump, and continually employ'd in emptying the water that
came in of all sides. Our <hi>Persian</hi> Pilot had not the least share of the common fear and distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we were all in, and no doubt wish'd himself in his own Ship, or nearer Land; in regard that
had we been cast away there, we had all inevitably perish'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 13. at the break of day, we perceiv'd, that we had still kept in sight of Land, and we
particularly discovered the Mountain of <hi>Derbent,</hi> which, as we conceived, could not be above
ten Leagues distant from us. The Tempest abating a little of its Violence, we hois'd the mizen
Sail, and afterwards the main Sail, with a resolution to run the Ship strait a-ground. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
the Night before, taken our course too high, and the wind continuing still from the
North-west, we were forc'd to comply with it, and, to our no small regret, pass beyond the
City of <hi>Derbent,</hi> along the <hi>Persian</hi> Coast, which, in that place, reaches from North to South,
but so as that we could not find any Road or Haven, where we might save our selves; for as
much as there being only Rocks at the bottom for the space of six Leagues from the Land into
the Sea, it is impossible to make the Anchor take any hold. At last, about four, in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
we cast Anchor, at four fathom water, before the Village of <hi>Niasebeth,</hi> which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
call <hi>Nisavay,</hi> the bottom muddy; but we thought not our selves more safe at Anchor,
than when we were toss'd up and down in the main Sea. The waves were so violent by reason
of the extraordinary roughness of the Sea, that it was not long ere they broke the hindges of
the Rudder, which oblig'd us to take it quite off, and to fasten it with a Cable behind the Ship,
lest beating against the Castle it should have broke it all to pieces; the Water coming still into
the Ship so fast, that we were forc'd to spend the remainder of that day, and all the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
in emptying it.</p>
                  <p>The Tempest abated a little of its violence the next morning, being the the 14. of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and invited us to think of some course for the disembarking of our selves, but we had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Boat nor Shallop to help us to Land, and though we had caus'd several Volleyes of great
and small shot to be discharg'd, to oblige the Inhabitants of the Countrey to come in to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
yet could we not perceive any body; but we had hardly made a shift to clap a certain
number of deal Boards together like a flat-bottom'd Boat, ere we saw coming towards us
two Boats, which the <hi>Kaucha,</hi> or Judge of the Village, had sent to our relief in that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                  <p>They brought us a present, of two baggs of Apples, with a very obliging Complement,
protesting that they were no less glad at our arrival, than we might be at theirs. Which done,
they exhorted the Ambassadors to get out of the Ship as soon as they could possibly, taking
along with them what they accompted of greatest Value, and not to be over-confident of the
clam,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors disembark with part of their retinue.</note> which, no doubt, would not last many hours. The Ambassadors took their advice, and
having put into the Boats what they thought most considerable, they ordered some part of their
retinue to go in also, and certain Soldiers with their Officers; leaving in the ship the Sieur
<hi>Vchterits,</hi> their Steward, and the Secretary of the Embassy, with an intent to send for them as
soon as they were landed themselves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Kaucha</hi> was on Horse-back at the Sea-side, and perceiving that the Boats could not come
near enough, by reason of the shallowness of the water, he alighted, and sent the Ambassadors
his Horse for their more convenient Landing. And thus it was that the Ambassadors first set
foot in <hi>Persia.</hi> But as soon as they were got a-shore, the Tempest grew more violent than it
had been before, insomuch that it was impossible for them to send back the Boats: which put
us that were left aboard to the utmost hazard of Shipwrack and Life. The Ship, being now in
a manner quite unloaden, was toss'd up and down like a Ball by the Waves, the Sea raising her,
one while, up to the Clouds, another swallowing her up in its abysses. There was constantly
above a foot water upon the Deck, so that we were not able to stay upon it; and at last the
Ship opening above, just in the middle, we began to fear the absolute dissolution of her. We
observ'd also by the Trees that were upon the Sea-side, that the Anchor was loose, and that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47786:98"/>
the wind had carry'd us above a quarter of a League from the place where he had disembarked
the Ambassadors, whereupon we cast two others, both which were lost about 11. the same
night, as also our Rudder. The biggest Anchor held still, but the Vessel drew so much water,
that the Pump being of no further use, we were forc'd to empty her with Kettles. About mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
the wind came to the East, and broke off our main and mizen Masts, and over-turn'd them
into the Sea, the Ship shaking in that interim with so much violence, that the edges of her
were ever and anon even with the water. The Sea-men intreated the Secretary, to give them
leave to cut the Ropes that still held her, to see if that would deliver us out of the extremity we
were in; which he made no difficulty to grant them. We had not eaten ought in three
dayes, and watching, with continual labour, had brought us so low, that having lost all cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
together with the hope of ever saving our Lives, all our thoughts were taken up with the
disposal of our selves for Death. Our Carpenter was the only person who had the courage to
go under Decks, and to take so large a dose of Aquavitae, that being come up on the Deck, he
fell down dead at our feet. Nor indeed could we have imagin'd him to be otherwise, if the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haltations
of the Aquavitae, that ascended from his stomach, had not discover'd the nature of his
indisposition.<note place="margin">A strange resolution in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</note> The Sea-men remitted nothing of their labour all this time, and exhorted the
rest to be of good courage, putting us in hope, that, within some few hours, either the weather
would change, or the Ambassadors would not fail to relieve us, as indeed they were both of
them earnest to do all lay in their power for our preservation. Nay the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi>
would, with his Sword drawn, have forc'd some of our people to come in the two Boats to
look after us, but he could by no means prevail with them, to hazard themselves.</p>
                  <p>Perceiving the day slipp'd away without any hope of relief, and fearing the Tempest might
grow more violent the night following, I took the Master's-mate aside, and was desirous to
know of him, whether, the Tempest continuing in the height it was then at, it would not be
our best course to run the Ship a-ground to save the men. His answer was, that he believ'd the
Ship could not make any great resistance, and that it were not amiss I took the advice of the
other Officers, and propose it to the Captain and the Master, who both confess'd, that the ship
was in so ill a plight, that they were confident the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> himself would have
commanded her to be run a-ground, had he been among them: and yet they were withall of
opinion, that, continuing their labour for some hours longer, it was not impossible but the
Vessel might be saved. But they discover'd by their discourse their main fear to be, that, when
there were no ship, they would be look'd on as useless persons, and that there might be some
dispute about their wages for the rest of the Voyage. Hence it came that they were unwilling
the ship should be run a-ground. But the Sieur <hi>Vchterits</hi> and the Secretary, overcome with the
importunities of the rest of the company to have that course taken, in so great an extremity,
the Captain and Masters-mate at last gave their consent, provided a promise were made them
in Writing, that the Ambassadors should not call them to an accompt for their so doing: which
was accordingly done, and the Secretary drew up an Act to that purpose, which was signed by
all. But the Captain and Master beginning to make new difficulties, after they had gotten a
discharge, as aforesaid, all our people would have mutini'd, and cry'd out, that if they delay'd
the running of the ship a-ground any longer, they should answer before the Tribunal of God,
to give an accompt for what should happen thereupon. The Captain would have excus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
alleging, that though the ship were run a-ground, as was desired, yet were it impossible
for him to save all our people: but answer was made him, that they were resolv'd to run the
hazard of it, and he was so earnestly press'd thereto, that he consented, after he had obliged
the Sieur <hi>Vchterits</hi> and the Secretary of the Embassy to give the first stroak upon the Cable:
which when they had done,<note place="margin">The Ship runs a-ground.</note> the Sea-men soon made an end, and having struck the only sayl we
had left us, we made strait to land, and run the ship a-ground, about thirty pearches distant
from the place where the Ambassadors and all our friends expected us, with no less trouble for
us, than we had for our selves. Nay some of them, to make a greater expression of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
came a good way into the water, and carry'd us ashore.</p>
                  <p>It prov'd no great trouble to us to justifie the resolution we had taken of running the Ship a-ground,
in regard that, as to that particular, the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> himself prevented us,
and told us he had been long before resolv'd to send the Captain orders to do it, but that he
could not meet with any person that would undertake the execution thereof.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea,<note place="margin">A descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea.</note> it hath not in all places the same name, but it is changed,
either according to the diversity of the Inhabitants that live about it, or the Provinces that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
upon it. It was called antiently the Sea of <hi>Chosar,</hi> from the Name of the eldest Son of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garma,</hi>
who was the Son of <hi>Gomer,</hi> and Grand-child of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> third Son to <hi>Noah. Nubius</hi>'s
<hi>Geography</hi> calls it the Sea of <hi>Travisthan.</hi> The <hi>Moors</hi> call this Sea, as they do also the Gulf of
<hi>Arabia, Bohar Corsuin;</hi> and the <hi>Persians</hi> call it <hi>Kulsum,</hi> which name they also give the <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Authors call it the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Sea, as also <hi>Mare Caspium</hi> and <hi>Caspianum.</hi>
The <hi>Persians</hi> call it by another name, the Sea of <hi>Baku,</hi> from the City of <hi>Bakuje,</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Schirwan;</hi> and the <hi>Muscovites</hi> name it <hi>Gualenskoi-more.</hi> But a man must be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47786:99"/>
how he credits what is affirmed by <hi>Dionysius Afer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1366.</note> 
                     <hi>Pomponius Mela, Pliny, Solinus,</hi> and
those who follow them, as <hi>Strabo, Martianus Capella,</hi> St. <hi>Basil the Great, Macrobius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that it is only a <hi>Sinus,</hi> or Gulf of the great Sea of the <hi>Indies,</hi> or of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Sea, or
that it hath some communication which the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, and <hi>Paulus Meotides</hi> by the River <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais;</hi>
in as much as it is most certain, that it hath not any communication at all with the other
Seas, but it is of all sides so encompass'd with Land, that it may be more justly called the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Is a sea by it self.</note>
than that which is known only by that name. <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> are much
more worthy credit, when they affirm, that the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea is a particular Sea by it self, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no communication with any other: and this is no more than what the Inhabitants of <hi>Kilan,</hi>
who live upon that Sea on the East-side, have so strongly confirmed us in, that we lay it down as
a thing no longer to be disputed.</p>
                  <p>But what on the other side is much to be wondred at, is, that though so great a number of
Rivers incessantly pay the tribute of their waters into it, yet can it not be said what becomes
thereof. We at first could hardly be induc'd to believe what was told us concerning all those
Rivers; but when, at our return out of <hi>Persia,</hi> between <hi>Rescht</hi> and <hi>Schamachy,</hi> which was
twenty days journey, we took notice, that we had cross'd above fourscore great and small
Rivers, we made no difficulty then to acquiesce in the Relations we had before received thereof.
The most considerable of those we saw, are, the <hi>Wolga, Araxis,</hi> or <hi>Aras,</hi> which is joyned to
the <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which is now called <hi>Kur,</hi> the <hi>Kisilosein,</hi> the <hi>Bustrow,</hi> the <hi>Aksai,</hi> and the <hi>Koisu.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North are the Rivers of <hi>Iaika</hi> and <hi>Iems;</hi> and towards the South and East, the <hi>Nios,</hi>
the <hi>Oxus,</hi> and the <hi>Orxentes,</hi> which <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> calls, <hi>Tanais.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And notwithstanding this vast Contribution of waters, this Sea is not perceiv'd to be any way
increas'd thereby, nor can it be said, by what passages all these Rivers are conveyed thence.
Some are of opinion, that they are, by subterranean Chanels return'd into the Ocean. The
<hi>Persians</hi> told us, that near <hi>Ferebath,</hi> between the Provinces of <hi>Tauristan,</hi> and <hi>Mesendan,</hi> there
is a Gulf, where all those waters are lost, as in a bottomless place, and convey'd away under the
neighbouring Mountains. But in regard a man must consequently to this assertion, imagine
that Gulf to be as big as the whole Sea, to swallow down the waters of so many Rivers, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be easily perswaded to side with the maintainers of that opinion. On the contrary, I think
it may be probably held, that there may be alleged, for the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, the same reasons as
are urged for Ocean's not overflowing the Earth, though an infinite number of Rivers fall into
it: To wit, that, besides the Mists, which are very frequent there, and consequently consume
a great part thereof, the rest is return'd by secret Chanels, to the sources of the Fountains and
Rivers, according to the wise-mans saying, that <hi>all the Rivers come out of the Sea, and return
thither again,</hi> whether it be that the weight of the Sea-water, which is not all within its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
forces that which is lowest into the clefts of the earth, as far as the sources, and that this is
done with such violence, that at its breaking out of the earth, it spouts higher than the Sea it
self; or that there are in the earth certain veins, which, drawing the water to them, distribute
it to the Fountains and Rivers. The first ratiocination is <hi>Iulius Scaliger</hi>'s, in his 46. <hi>Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
where he says, that he does not believe, the Argument which is deduc'd from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the qualities of waters can destroy the force of his, in regard we find by experience,
that the water, passing through the earth, is cleansed from its filth, and leaves its Salt at the
bottom, from which it is divided, much after the same manner as if it were distill'd through an
Alembick. Which is evidently seen by this, that the greater distance there is between the Sea
and the Fountains, the sweeter their waters are. It is also acknowledg'd, that there is no
Mountain higher than the Sea, which making but one part of the roundness of the Terrestrial
Globe, the swellings and emmencies, which are upon the earth are not higher than the Sea.
Which I affirm to be so much the more certain, upon this accompt, that, being, in my return
from <hi>Persia,</hi> between <hi>Schamachie</hi> and <hi>Derbent,</hi> at the Village of <hi>Soray,</hi> I had the curiosity to go
up into one of the adjacent Mountains, where I took the Horizon with my Astrolabe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
put my <hi>Dioptra</hi> into it, I turn'd myself towards the Sea, which was two Leagues distant
thence, and could easily discern it.</p>
                  <p>The Authors who have written of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, affirm, that, it is, in length fifteen dayes
journey, and in breadth, eight; which may fall out somewhat right, if it be in a great calm, and
that those who are to pass it, make use only of their Arms and Oars, and have no advantage
of wind.<note place="margin">The length &amp; breadth of the <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Sea.</note> Whereupon I propose it as a particular observation, that, contrary to the common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of all Geographers, as well antient as modern, the length of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea reaches
not from East to West, as it is set down in all Maps, even in those that have been publish'd since
the former impression of this Relation, where I condemn'd that errour, but that it is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from South to North, and that, on the contrary, it is its breadth which reaches from West
to East. And this I know, not only by the most exact observation I made thereof, but also by
a curious inquiry of the situation of all the Maritime Provinces, according to the Catalogue or
Register, of Longitudes and Latitudes, which I had from the <hi>Persians,</hi> as also consonantly to the
Astronomical fragments of the Learned M. <hi>Iohn Graves.</hi> For it is certain, that the true length
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47786:99"/>
of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea,<note place="margin">1636.</note> is from the mouth of the River <hi>Wolga,</hi> below <hi>Astrachan,</hi> to <hi>Ferabath,</hi> in
the Province of <hi>Mesenderan,</hi> reaching eight degrees of the <hi>Aequator,</hi> which make 120. <hi>German</hi>
Leagues; and that its breadth, from the Province of <hi>Chuaresm,</hi> named by others <hi>Karragan,</hi> to
the Mountains of <hi>Circassia,</hi> or to <hi>Schirwan,</hi> is six degrees, which make but 90 <hi>German</hi> leagues.
According to this accompt thereof are to be corrected all the Geographical Maps, though the
opinion we introduce be new, and directly contrary to that which hath been receiv'd for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ages.</p>
                  <p>Nor are we to give any more credit to what <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">The water is Salt.</note> when he says, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea is fresher than that of the Ocean, unless he be conceiv'd to speak only of
the coast of <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> which is now called <hi>Kilan,</hi> where indeed the water is neither salt nor
fresh, but brackish (as it is in several places of <hi>Holland</hi>) by reason of the mixture of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of divers Rivers, which fall into the said Sea on that side. For, in the Sea it self, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is as salt as any other that ever I could taste of. <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Arrian</hi> affirm the same thing of
the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea; and <hi>Ovid</hi> confirms it by this Distick.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Copia tot laticum, quas anget, adulteret undas,</l>
                     <l>Nec patitur vires aequer habere suas.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>It is besides our design to engage into any discussion of <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s position, who says in his 53
<hi>Exercitation,</hi> that the water of all Seas is sweet, or fresh, at the bottom, nor yet to examine
the Reasons alleged by him for that opinion, as falling not under the subject of our Relation.
But this we shall presume to affirm, that the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea was not much known to the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
in the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> since <hi>Arrian</hi> says, in the seventh Book of his History, that that
great Conquerour issu'd out his commands, that Timber should be fell'd in the neighbouring
Mountains, for the building of a Fleet, which he intended to employ in the discovery of that
Sea. It is certain also, that <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> speaks not of it otherwise than according to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which some had thereof, in a time when that of the <hi>Romans</hi> had not pass'd the <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
no more than their Arms. For though <hi>Pliny</hi> says, <hi>lib. 6. ch.</hi> 17. of his <hi>Natural History,</hi> that
<hi>Seleuchus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the Successors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> made a discovery of that Sea by <hi>Patroclus,</hi>
their Admiral, yet he is withall forc'd to acknowledge, that there were many other things to
be discovered; as it was also our intention, to make use, to that purpose, of our Ship and Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
during the aboad we should make at the Court of <hi>Persia,</hi> if our misfortune in being cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
upon this Sea had not defeated us of our expectations. Certain it is, that this Sea does
neither Ebb nor Flow,<note place="margin">Neither Ebbs nor Flows.</note> nay that indeed it is not capable of either; forasmuch as it hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
or correspondence with the other, which, in that particular, follows the motion of
the Moon.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians, Tartars,</hi> and <hi>Muscovites</hi> seldome venture upon this Sea but in the Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
and then dare they not hazard themselves far into it; for sailing only in wretched small
Barks, or Boats, they keep as near as they can to the shore, and never are out of sight of Land.
It hath in a manner no safe Havens or Harbours. The best it hath, is the same we spoke of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
near <hi>Terki,</hi> between the Isle of <hi>Tzenzeni</hi> and the Continent; at which place the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
are wont to cast Anchor, and stay for a night. The havens of <hi>Baku, Lenkeran</hi> and <hi>Ferabath</hi>
are none of the worst, nor are they on the other side the safest; and the best Haven of all this
Sea, is on the side of the grand <hi>Tartary,</hi> and near the City of <hi>Minkischlak,</hi> which may
be found in the Itinerary of <hi>Anthony Ienkinson,</hi> under the name of <hi>Manguslave,</hi> but mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named.</p>
                  <p>But, how ere it be Haven'd, we may confidently affirm this, that we have been long enough
upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea and its Coasts, to undeceive those who are apt to believe, what is deliver'd
by <hi>Petreius</hi> in his History of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> to wit, that the water of it is as black as Ink, and
that it is full of Islands, which are well stored with Inhabitants, and have in them a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Cities and Villages; both which we affirm to be absolutely false. For the water of it is
of the same Colour, as that of all other Seas; and though we discover'd but some part of the <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi>
Sea, yet having made particular enquiry as to this particular, all the <hi>Persians, Tartars</hi> and
<hi>Muscovites</hi> I ever discoursed with concerning it, unanimously assur'd me, that in all that Sea
there is but one Island, wherein there is, I will not say either City or Village, but so much as
a House, unless it be in that of <hi>Ensil,</hi> near <hi>Ferabath,</hi> where the pastures being very good, such
as keep Cattel, have made certain Huts, not so much for their setled Habitations, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the injuries of the Weather at certain times.</p>
                  <p>I also enquired of the Inhabitants of <hi>Kilan,</hi> whether the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea bred such an infinite
number of great Serpents, as <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> would make us believe: but they all assur'd me they
had never seen any, and that it was a thing they never had heard spoken of before, no more than
they had of a certain great round Fish without a Head, whereof <hi>Ambrosius Contarinus</hi> speaks in
the relation of his Travels, which Father <hi>Bizarrus</hi> hath Printed together with his History of
<hi>Perisa.</hi> He sayes, that this Fish is an ell and a half Diameter, and that there is a certain Liquor
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47786:100"/>
drawn out of it, which the <hi>Persians</hi> use in their Lamps, and to grease the Camels, But the
<hi>Persians</hi> told me, that they stood not in need of any such Oyl to burn, since that near the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Baku,</hi> under the Mountain of <hi>Barmach,</hi> there are inexhaustible sources of a certain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
which they call <hi>Nefla,</hi> and make use of in their Lamps. And of this there is daily such
great quantities taken up, that it is transported all over the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Certain indeed it is, that there may be seen in those parts a certain kind of Fish, which they
call <hi>Naka,</hi> that is, <hi>Glutton;</hi> which hath a very short Nose, and the Head as it were within the
Belly, having a round Tail, and being seven or eight foot in breadth, and not much less in
length. It fastens it self with the Tail to Fisher-mens Boats, and, if they be not very carefull,
over-turns them. The <hi>Persians</hi> told us also, that the white Fishes, of which we have spoken
heretofore, do the same, and that thence it comes, though the weather be ever so calm, the
Fisher-men never venture far into the Sea. This is the only Creature, which may in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
make good what <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> sayes in his Geography, to wit, that the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea
breeds so great a number of monstrous Fishes, which he calls <hi>Belluae,</hi> wild Beasts, that that is
one of the main Reasons, why it is not Navigable. This fish delights much in the Liver and
Flesh of Beef and Mutton, whence it is that the Inhabitants of <hi>Kilan,</hi> especially those who live
towards the Mountain of <hi>Sahebelan,</hi> as being the most hindred in their Fishing, make baits
thereof, wherewith they cover strong and sharp Hooks fasten'd to Great Cords, with which
they draw them to Land. Nor are we to credit what the same <hi>Bizarrus</hi> and <hi>Contarinus</hi> affirm,
when they say, that there is no other fish in the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; for, on the contrary, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
well stor'd with fish, and there are in it abundance of <hi>Salmons</hi> and <hi>Sturgeons,</hi> as also a
kind of <hi>Herrings;</hi> nay there are in it some fish, which in other places are numbred among the
fresh-water-fish, and are had only in ponds; as for instance <hi>Breams,</hi> which they call <hi>Chascham,</hi>
and <hi>Barbels,</hi> which they call <hi>Schwit:</hi> but the latter are tough and insipid, if they exceed two
foot in length. There is also a kind of <hi>Trouts,</hi> which they call <hi>Suggaht.</hi> These are not eaten
fresh, but falted and hung up in the smoke, and their way of dressing them, is, to lay them on
the hearth, with a clean linnen Cloath about them, and then to cover them with hot ashes, till
such time as they are ready: being thus ordered, they make a very pleasant and delicious dish.
There are no Pikes nor Eels in all <hi>Persia,</hi> insomuch that those <hi>Persians,</hi> whom the King sent
along with us into <hi>Germany,</hi> when they saw us eat Eeles, conceived a horrour thereat, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them for Snakes. The King of <hi>Persia</hi> farms out the fishing of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, towards
the mouths of Rivers, which brings him in very considerable sums of Money, many times more
than the Farmers make thereof, for instance, the City of <hi>Kesker,</hi> where a Farmer named
<hi>Schemsi</hi> paid eight thousand Crowns for the farming of five Rivers, which that year had yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but six thousand. Their fishing is only from <hi>September</hi> to <hi>April,</hi> and during that time, there
is a Palisadoe or kind of Hedge made in the Sea at the mouth of the River, to hinder the fishing
of those that have no right to fish, within that enclosure; but all the year besides it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
permitted to all, and in the Sea it self, at all times.</p>

                  <p>It is most certain, that <hi>Parthia</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> were heretofore two distinct Kingdomes, and that
the name of <hi>Persia</hi> hath not been common to both, till they became both subject to the same
King, and were inhabited by the same people. Upon the same Consideration it is, that we now
comprehend under the name of <hi>Persia,</hi> not only the Kingdom of <hi>Persia</hi> it self, but also all the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47786:104"/>
other Provinces which have been annexed thereto,<note place="margin">1366.</note> either by Conquest or otherwise, and are
now under the Jurisdiction of that Monarch. Hence it is, that when we speak of <hi>Persia,</hi> our
meaning is, to comprehend, under that name, all that Country, which reaches from North to
South-west, from the <hi>Caspian</hi>-sea, to the Gulf of <hi>Persia,</hi> and from East to West, from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Euphrates,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Morat su,</hi> to the City of <hi>Candahar,</hi> upon the frontiers of
the <hi>Indies.</hi> By assigning it the <hi>Caspian</hi>-sea for its frontier, our meaning is to comprehend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
near the one half of that sea, along the Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> reaching West-ward as far
as the River of <hi>Ruth-Cane Kurkahn,</hi> by the Antients called <hi>Oxus,</hi> which divides the <hi>Persians</hi>
from the <hi>Vsbeques,</hi> who are the same that are called the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Buchar,</hi> and are for the most
part Tributaries to the King of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence is to be observed by the way the error of <hi>Bottero,</hi> who, in his <hi>Politia Regin</hi> says, that
the extent of <hi>Persia</hi> from North to South is eighteen degrees. Wherein he is so much the more
mistaken, by how much it is certain, that, from the first City of <hi>Persia</hi> from the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea,
to its utmost frontiers towards the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, there are hardly twelve degrees. For, let a
man but cast his Eye, not only on the Map, which we here give of it, but also on that of M.
<hi>Sampson,</hi> and particularly on that of the Learned Mr. <hi>Iohn Graves,</hi> not long since publish'd by
him in <hi>England,</hi> and he will find, that the City of <hi>Husum,</hi> which the Inhabitants of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
call <hi>Rescht,</hi> within two small Leagues of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, lies at thirty seven degrees, and
that the City of <hi>Ormus,</hi> upon the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, is but at twenty five, which make but twelve
in all. We acknowledge that it contains above twenty degrees in length, from the <hi>Euphrates</hi>
to the <hi>Indies:</hi> but we are to consider withall, that one degree of Longitude under the thirty
seventh degree of Latitude, under which <hi>Persia</hi>

<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great caused it to be set on fire, out of a fond Compliance for a common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,

the foundation of that of <hi>Schiras</hi> upon the River <hi>Bendemir,</hi> which <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> calls <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxis,</hi>
Its principal Cities, besides that of <hi>Schiras,</hi> whereof there will be an accompt given in

that which the Antients called <hi>Media Acropatia,</hi> though <hi>Ienkinson,</hi> in his Itinerary. affirms,
that it is the antient <hi>Hyrcania.</hi> It is indeed the most Northerly part of the antient <hi>Media,</hi> which
<hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> deliver to be Mountainous and Cold. Whereof we had a sufficient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in our Travels, after our departure from <hi>Schamachie,</hi> as will be seen in its due place.
<hi>Schamachie</hi> is the Metropolis of the Province, wherein there are besides, <hi>Bakuje</hi> seated at the
foot of a Mountain upon the <hi>Caspian</hi>-sea, which from its name is called the sea of <hi>Baku:</hi> That

to meet with a very accurate Map of this Country, together with a particular relation of what
ever is most observable therein, we shall endeavour to find else-where some occasion to speak of
a thing, which to treat of in this place would make too great a Digression.</p>

And forasmuch as it is acknowledg'd that the Province of <hi>Kurdestan</hi> is that which the Antients
call'd <hi>Assyria,</hi> we may in some measure be satisfy'd with what <hi>Nubius</hi>'s Geography says, to wit, that
it is the more Northerly part of <hi>Assyria,</hi> since they have their Frontiers common, and in a manner
confounded. It is divided from the Province of <hi>Schiruan,</hi> by the Deserts of <hi>Mokan,</hi> and from that
of <hi>Karabag,</hi> by the River <hi>Aras,</hi> and it hath, on the East, the Province of <hi>Kilan. Adirbeitzan</hi> is also

It is the antient <hi>Hyrcania.</hi> For its situation absolutely agrees with that which is given it
by <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> and that it is encompass'd, after the manner of a Crescent, with a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
cover'd with Trees. It is water'd by many little Rivers. It comprehends several other
Provinces, among which, some number that of <hi>Thabristan</hi> or <hi>Mesauderan,</hi> which is the same
with that, whose Inhabitants, in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, were called <hi>Mardi.</hi> The

abounding in Fruit, and every where cover'd, and as it were strew'd with Flowers,
especially Roses, whereof this Province produces such great quantity, that a considerable part
of its Revenue is rais'd out of the water made of them. The Inhabitants call it <hi>Gulap,</hi> whence
it may be well imagin'd that the Word <hi>Iulip</hi> comes, and they drive a great Trade with it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at <hi>Ispahan.</hi> Those who Trade most in it, are the <hi>Lurs,</hi> who are a sort of people by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
distinguish'd from the other <hi>Persians</hi> by what they wear about their Heads, which is a
kind of Coiffure, that is longer and narrower than the ordinary Turbants, and there is fasten'd to
it a tuft or tassel, which hangs down over the Back. There is also in this Province a Drugg ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
soverain against the Worms, which is called <hi>Daru Kirman,</hi> as well upon accompt of the
Province, as also hence, that the Word <hi>Kirman</hi> signifies a Worm. And concerning this, there
is a story of one of their Kings, who being in the fields on Horse-back, heard himself call'd by
his own name. He look'd back, as if he had heard the voice behind him, and seeing only a dead
man's skull half rotten upon the ground, and doubting the voice proceeded thence, he asked,
who it was. The skull answer'd, that that was all was left of what he had sometime been; that
he had worn a Crown as well as himself, and had Conquer'd several great Provinces, but that
desirous to add, to his other Conquests, that of <hi>Kirman,</hi> he had been over-come and eaten;
exhorting him to reflect on what he had seen, and to make his advantage of that Philosophy.
The Province is barren enough towards the North, having on that side abundance of heathy
grounds; but towards the Sea-side it is very fertil. Its principal Cities are <hi>Birsir, Bermasir,
Bem, Chabis, Tzirest, Kamron,</hi> and <hi>Ormus, Kamron</hi> is a Sea-port, whence it is many times
called <hi>Bender,</hi> or <hi>Bender Kamron. Ormus,</hi> by the <hi>Persians</hi> called <hi>Hormous,</hi> is an Island, three
Leagues distant from the Continent: but of these two places, the Reader will have a further

that the Inhabitants of <hi>Babylon</hi> had heretofore their Summer-Houses and Gardens at the
place where now <hi>Bagdat</hi> stands, insomuch that after the destruction of the City, they found it
no great difficulty to remove their habitations thither. And indeed, the word <hi>Bag,</hi> which

                     </note> the Country where we were cast a-shore, is very pleasant,
it was all over green at the time of our arrival, and the Birds, which were not yet sensible of
the Cold, ordinary in our parts, continued their Chirping and Singing till near the middle of
<hi>December.</hi> The soil there is very good, bringing forth Rice, Wheat, and Barley, in great
abundance. They make no Hay, because their Cattle are out Winter and Summer; but if
they make any, it is only for the convenience of Travellers. Their Vines were scatter'd up and
down, Planted without any care or order, all along the Hedges the Vines being fasten'd to the
Trees, so as that they spread up to the extremities of the Boughs, from which the small bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
hung donw three or four Ells in length. All the Province of <hi>Kilan</hi> is full of them, and at our
return, we saw very fair and very large ones, at <hi>Astora.</hi> The Country affords good store of
Wild-fowl, especially Pheasants, as also of Hares, the Hunting whereof found us good sport
during the aboad we were forc'd to make there. There is also in these parts a certain kind of
Foxes, which they call <hi>Shakal,</hi> about the bigness of those of <hi>Europe,</hi> (of which kind there
are also abundance, and the Inhabitants call them <hi>Tulki</hi>) but instead of Furr or Hair, they
are cover'd with Wool, and have white bellies, Ears all black, and less Tails than those of our
parts. We heard them in the night time running in Herds about the Village, and were not
a little troubled at their Cries, which was a drawling and doleful noise, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants make use of Buffles or wild Oxen, more than they do of Horses, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of loading them upon their Backs, they make them draw Wood, or any other things of
great weight. Their ordinary sustenance is Feny-greek, wherewith they sow whole Fields, as
we do with Vetches and Lentills, and they cut it while it is yet green, Herb and Seed together,
and so give it those Creatures to eat. The Milk, I mean that of the Females, is so fat, that it
makes a Cream two fingers thick, of which they make exellent Butter. They never make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cheese of Cow's-milk, but only of sheeps.</p>
                  <p>The Village of <hi>Niasabath</hi> is at 41 deg. 15 min. Elevation,<note place="margin">The Houses of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </note> and hath not above 15 or 16 poor
Houses, which lye scatter'd up and down, all built of Clay, and absolutely square, having
flat Roofs, and cover'd with Turfs, so as that a man might walk upon them without either dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or inconvenience. And indeed it is ordinary among the <hi>Persians,</hi> to erect Tents upon them,
to eat, and, in the summer-time, to lye on them all night, that they may the more participate of the
coolness of the Air. Here it was that I first understood what the Gospel says of the Paralytick, who
was let down through the Roof of the House; and the Counsel our Saviour gave those who
were upon the House-top, not to come down into the House; for this is their way of building
all over the East. We were at first lodg'd in the Houses, which were very handsome within,
and the floors of the Chambers for the most part cover'd with Tapistry, and the Masters of the
Houses receiv'd and treated us the first day very well. But the Village being but small, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to find Lodging for all our retinue, and our aboad being likely to be too long there for us
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47786:106"/>
to lye upon the charges of the Inhabitants, we got Tents pitch'd near the Lodgings of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
where we continu'd till the Court of <hi>Persia</hi> took order for our departure thence.
We had no Bread; our Beer was lost with the ship, and the Village had no spring of fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
so that we were forc'd to look after our Mouldy scraps, and to content our selves with
the troubled water of a small Torrent, which pass'd near the Village, while our ship furnish'd
us with firing for the Kitchen and the Chambers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov. 19. Schachewerdi,</hi> Governour of <hi>Derbent</hi> sent to complement us, upon the occasion of
our arrival there, two Persons, very well clad, one whereof was Brother to the <hi>Kaucha</hi> of
<hi>Niasabath.</hi> They deliver'd the Ambassadors the <hi>Sulthan</hi>'s Letter, which came with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of two Horses, as many Oxen, twelve sheep, twenty Pullets, three great Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Wine, one Pitcher of Water, two Paniers of Apples, and three sacks of Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower.</p>
                  <p>But the Ambassadors coming to understand, that the <hi>Sulthan</hi>'s Letter made mention only
of one Horse, they would not receive the other, though the <hi>Persians</hi> earnestly protested, that
the mistake came only hence, that the <hi>Sulthan</hi> imagining there had been but one Ambassador,
had accordingly sent but one Horse, and that they, coming afterwards to hear there were two,
had bought another horse, out of an assurance that it was the <hi>Sulthan</hi>'s intention to have done
so.<note place="margin">Brugmans <hi>incivility.</hi>
                     </note> But notwithstanding all their allegatons and instances, the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> would
by no means accept of the horse, for no other reason, doubtless, than this, that his was not so
good as his Collegue's. The <hi>Persians</hi> were not a little troubled thereat, and look'd on it as an
affront done the <hi>Sulthan,</hi> who resented it so highly since, that he did us all the ill-Offices lay in
his power, being also further troubled in this respect, that, contrary to the custom of <hi>Persia</hi> and
<hi>Muscovy,</hi> upon the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi>'s untowardness, his People had been sent away
without Presents.</p>
                  <p>The 22. the Ambassadors sent <hi>Francis Meurier,</hi> one of our Retinue, with our <hi>Persian</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,
to the <hi>Chan</hi> or Governour general of the Province of <hi>Schiruan,</hi> whose ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
is at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> to acquaint him with our arrival, and to entreat him to supply us with
all things necessary for the continuation of our journey. The Governour, who had heard of it
by some other means had immediately sent a <hi>Mehemander</hi> to us (so they call in <hi>Persia</hi> those
who among the <hi>Muscovites</hi> are called <hi>Pristafs,</hi> whose charge it is to conduct the Ambassadors
through the Country, and to see them furnish'd with Provisions and Carriage) but our people
had mist him by the way.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Mehemander</hi> came to our Quarters the 29. of <hi>November.</hi> He was most sumptuously
Cloathed, and excellently well mounted, on a very gallant horse, the Harness whereof was
cover'd with Gold, and beset with Turquezes. He acquitted himself very handsomly both in
his address and complement, with promises of all the civilities and services it was in his power
to do us, as long as we should be under his conduct, which was as far as <hi>Schamachie.</hi> Having
answer'd his Complement, we invited him, and those who came along with him, to taste of
our fruits, and of all sorts of Aquavitae, wherewith we were well stor'd. We also caused our
great Guns to be discharg'd, and we entertain'd them with our Musick, wherewith they seem'd
to be much taken. As soon as the <hi>Mehemander</hi> was return'd to his Lodging, he sent us a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of five sheep, three Pitchers of Wine, and some Pomegranates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> the last, came back <hi>Francis Meurier</hi> with the Interpreter, bringing this accompt, that
the <hi>Chan</hi> being not at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> at their coming thither, they had been oblig'd to follow
him into the Country, where they had found him encamp'd under Tents, with a Retinue of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
four hundred persons: That he had receiv'd them kindly, and had assur'd them, that he
had already sent a <hi>Mehemandar,</hi> whose care it should be to see the Ambassadors supply'd with
all things necessary for the continuation of their journey; that he had told them further, that he
heard the Ambassadors had a Retinue of about three hundred men, but they should be all wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
though they were twice the number: That it was a great while since we first heard of
this Embassy, and that he was very desirous to see us. To which accompt the Interpreter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
only this, that the Governour had particularly desir'd to be inform'd by him, of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and humours of the Ambassadors, as also of that of the persons whereof our Retinue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
and our manner of life.</p>
                  <p>The first ill Office the <hi>Sulthan</hi> of <hi>Derbent</hi> did us, was, in denying us a sufficient number of

                  </p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47786:106"/>
those poor people had been ten dayes together strugling with the wind and waves ere they could

                  <p>The joy we might well conceive at our being in <hi>Persia,</hi> after so troublesome a Voyage,
wherein we had run through so many dangers, was much abated by the inconveniences which
the untowardness and humoursomness of one of the Chiefest in the Company run us into: but I

Village, where we found out a little place, whereof the Rivulet maketh almost a Peninsula, so
pleasant and inviting, that the fairest Meadows in <hi>Europe</hi> afford not any thing so delightful in
the best Season of the year. The water came almost round about that little parcel of ground,
and the Pomegranate-Trees, which had joyn'd their verdure with that of the Vines, invited us
to rest our selves under their shade, and to divert our selves with the memory of our dear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
to which divertisement our Physician, Dr. <hi>Graman,</hi> contributed very much, by the good
cheer he made us of Gamons of Bacon, Neats Tongues, and two or three sorts of Sack and

twenty persons. After his Visit, he went to the next Village to look for Lodging, there being
none to be had in ours, and sent us the next day, as a Present, an Ox, some Sheep, and two
great Paniers of Apples. That which the Ambassadors sent in return thereto, consisted in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Ells of Cloath and Satin, a Vessel of Aquavitae, and a Roll of Tobacco. And whereas he
had express'd, that they would do him a great kindness to give him a little Gun-powder, to be
reveng'd for the incursions which <hi>Sulthan Mahomet</hi> had made into his Territories, the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
sent him a Barrel that weigh'd 80. pounds.</p>
                  <p>The return of our <hi>Mehemandar,</hi> who came back the same day, made us the more joyfull,

journey any longer.</p>
                  <p>According to this promise, the 12. there came in some Horses and Camels, but we heard of
no more afterwards. The <hi>Mehemandar</hi> excused himself upon the Snow that had fallen the night
before, and said, that the <hi>Persians</hi> were wont to travel in the cold, and that the Camels
whose hoofs are not so falt as those of other Creatures, would not have been able to go by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the slipperiness of the way. Whereto he added, that it had hapned, that whole <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans</hi>
had perish'd, through cold, in the Mountains, for want of Wood and Lodging, which are
very scarce upon that Road, though there be but twenty Leagues, or <hi>Farsangs,</hi> from <hi>Niasabath</hi>
to <hi>Scamachie.</hi> True it is indeed, that for some nights we had Snow, but the Sun melted it as
soon as he appear'd over the Horizon. But how ere it happen'd, we were forc'd to stay there
ten dayes longer; which made us imagine that what was done was out of design, purposely to
defer our departure thence, till they should receive the Orders which they expected from the

not build his ships that year. The Ambassador went on in his intended design, and told those
of our Retinue, who would have disswaded him from it, that it was the humour of that Nation,
not to do any thing till they are forc'd to it, and that the only way was to domineer over them.
But the <hi>Persians</hi> had afterwards the advantage to laugh at us, when they furnish'd us with so
few horses, that being not able to draw our Artillery, we were forc'd to leave our Carriages
behind, and to load our Guns upon Camels.</p>

Chambers and the Kitchin was to be pack'd up, there were but sixty Horses left for all the rest

Hence it came, that upon the 22. of <hi>December</hi> we were forc'd to depart, some on Hors-back,
some behind them, and the rest, to wit, the Lacqueys, the Guards, and the Soldiers, afoot.
Our way lay South-ward along the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors leave <hi>Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabath.</hi>
                     </note> and we cross'd that day four small Rivers.
The first place we Lodg'd at was the Village of <hi>Mordou,</hi> within the Government of <hi>Scamachy,</hi>
somewhat above four Leagues from <hi>Niasabath.</hi> The houses there were all round, and built up
of Ozier and Canes, as those of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> The Inhabitants call them <hi>Ottak.</hi> The nights
were cold enough, and there was no Wood in the Village, so that we spent our time there
uneasily enough, especially those, who had wetted themselves by going through the water
afoot.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Mordou</hi> signifies a Fen, and the Village derives its name from the Fenny places
which lye about it, wherein there are many Springs, which send forth their water with such
violence, that there is no cold so great as to congeal them. Whence it comes, that there are
abundance of Swans there, even in the Winter, whose down is gather'd for the <hi>Sophy</hi>'s Beds
and Pillows.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Padars.</hi> a people.</note> This Village is inhabited by a certain people whom they call <hi>Padars,</hi> who have
their particular language, though with some relation to the <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Persian.</hi> Their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the <hi>Mahumetane,</hi> inclining to the <hi>Turkish,</hi> but accompany'd besides with infinite Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions.
Among others they have this, that they leave their meat after it is dressed, to grow
almost cold before they eat it, and if it happen that any one, ignorant of their customs, should
blow or breath upon it, they cast it away as impure.</p>
                  <p>The Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> sent for the <hi>Kaucha</hi> or Bayly of <hi>Niasabath,</hi> and complain'd to
him of the ill Offices done us by the <hi>Sulthan</hi> of <hi>Derbent,</hi> in not allowing the Carriage necessary
for the prosecution of our Voyage; insomuch that he was oblig'd to see some part of his Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
whom he lov'd as his own eyes, go afoot, and likely to miscarry by the way, of which
proceeding he should give the <hi>Sophy</hi> a full accompt as soon as he came to Court. The <hi>Kaucha</hi>
made answer, that it must needs be, the <hi>Sulthan</hi> knew not we had so much Baggage; but said
withall, that he could not imagine what pleasure we took in carrying along with us Sails, brass
Guns, and Carriages, which could only put us to trouble, and retard our journey, and that if
the Ambassador did put up his complaints, the <hi>Sulthan</hi> for his part would easily find out wayes
to justifie himself. The next day, our <hi>Mehemandar</hi> brought us twenty horses more, so that
having lessen'd our Baggage by certain Chests and useless Vessels, which were ordered to be
broken, we made a shift to set all our people on Horse-back. We travell'd that day three leagues,
and came at night to the Village of <hi>Tachousi,</hi> which lies in a bottom, and hath very handsome
Houses.</p>
                  <p>The 24. we got three Leagues further,<note place="margin">They lodge in a <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vansera.</hi>
                     </note> and came to the high Mountain of <hi>Barmach,</hi> at the
foot whereof we took up our quarters, in a great Court, which was all open, and had only the
four bare Walls. The <hi>Persians</hi> call those places <hi>Caravanseras,</hi> and they are as the <hi>Ventas</hi> in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and serve for Inns upon the High-way, in the deserts of <hi>Persia.</hi> They are within a dayes
Journey one of another, for the greater convenience of Travellers, who are oblig'd to bring
along with them Provisions and Forrage for Horse and Man, for you find in them, at the best,
but Chambers and Halls, and those not furnish'd with any thing, and have only a Roof to keep
you dry.</p>
                  <p>The Waggoners and Mule-drivers of <hi>Derbent</hi> made a shew as if they would have return'd,
and have left us there, to stay till other conveniences of Riding and Carriage were brought us
from <hi>Schamachie:</hi> but finding, on the other side, that the Ambassadors had ordered the Drums
to be beaten to bring their people together, and that command was issued out that all should
march a-foot, and abandon the Baggage, to be made good at their perils who refus'd to supply
them with necessary carriages, they chang'd their resolution, and staid.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Caravansera</hi> was a very antient structure, all built with large Free-stones, being forty
two paces square. Over the Gate, there were two Chambers, where we found certain Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters, and some Characters, which none in the company could either read
or comprehend.</p>
                  <p>The 25. being <hi>Christmas</hi> day, we did our Devotions in the great Stable which was appointed
for the Camels; which done, some of our retinue had the curiosity to go and take a view of
the Mountain, induc'd thereto by the maraculous relations which the <hi>Persians</hi> had made us
thereof by the way.</p>
                  <p>This Mountain lies within a quarter of a League of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea,<note place="margin">The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Barmach.</hi>
                     </note> and, by reason of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
height, is seen at a very great distance. It is in a manner round, having on the very
top of it a great Rock streight up, and very steepy of all sides, from which it hath the name of
<hi>Barmach,</hi> that is, <hi>finger:</hi> because it looks like a finger stretch'd out above the other adjacent
Mountains. We understood since, that there is a path, which will commodiously enough bring
one to the top of it, but we knew it not then, so that we ran great hazard of our Lives in getting
up by dreadful precipices.</p>
                  <p>It was so cold upon the Mountain, that the Grass, which was high enough there, was all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with a white frost as with Sugar-candy, whereas at the foot of the Mountain, near the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47786:107"/>
                     <hi>Caravansera,</hi> the weather was fair and mild. Upon the edge of the Mountain, and at the foot
of the Rock, there is a plain of about fifty perches square, which hath in the midst of it, a
very fair Well, built about with stone, and about that Well may be seen the ruins of a very
thick Wall, flank'd at the corners with certain Towers and Bulwarks, wherewith that structure
had sometime been fortify'd, as also with two good deep ditches built about with Free-stone,
which satisfy'd us they were the ruins of an impregnable Fortress. Towards the Northern part
of the Mountain,<note place="margin">Ruins of Fortresses.</note> we met with other ruins, which could be no other than the remainders of
another Fort. They facilitated our access to an ascent, which was cut in the Rocks, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
us almost up to the Top, where we saw a Vault, and the remainder of a third Structure,
which had sometimes serv'd for a Dungeon, or place of retreat, after the loss of the two
other Forts.</p>
                  <p>I imagine that this may have been one of those Fortifications,<note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Persians</hi> concerning these For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses.</note> which the Antients called
<hi>Portae Caspiae,</hi> or <hi>Ferreae,</hi> whereof there is a description in the Greek and Latin Histories. The
<hi>Persians</hi> are of opinion, that these structures were built by <hi>Iscander,</hi> so they call <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great, and that they were demolish'd by <hi>Tamberlane.</hi> We rested out selves upon the
Rock, where we sung <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and renew'd among our selves the friendship, which we had
before mutually promis'd each other by most unfeigned protestations: and having gather'd cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Figs off the Trees, which grew out of the clefts of the Rock, we got down again with less
trouble and danger, by the ordinary path.</p>
                  <p>The 26. we left <hi>Barmach,</hi> having very fair weather, the Sun casting at that time a greater
heat than it does with us in <hi>May.</hi> The Waggons, with the Baggage, took the way of the
plain towards <hi>Bakuje,</hi> and the Ambassadors, with those of the retinue, who were on Horse-back,
took that of the Mountain. We Travell'd that day five leagues, and came at night to a
Village named <hi>Chanega,</hi> within the Mountains. There, we met with abundance of excellent
Fruits, and good store of Honey; but the water thereabouts was troubled, corrupted, and
stunk.</p>
                  <p>The next day,<note place="margin">The Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of a <hi>Persian</hi> Saint.</note> 
                     <hi>Decemb.</hi> 27. we got five Leagues further, to a Village named <hi>Pyrmaraas,</hi>
three Leagues from <hi>Scamachie.</hi> This place is very famous, by reason of one of their Saints
named <hi>Scid-Ibrahim,</hi> whose Sepulchre is to be seen there. The <hi>Persians</hi> affirm it to be very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and so great a Veneration had for it, that <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> who had no religious respect for
any thing, would not meddle with that Sepulchre, though he destroy'd all else that lay in his
way. This structure hath its Walls, and its two Courts, as a Castle. Our Ambassadors sent
the <hi>Mehemandar</hi> to the Guardian of the place, to entreat him, that they might be permitted
to enter; but all they could obtain, was only to see the first Court, which was full of square
stones, which were set up-an-end, to distinguish the Graves of private Persons.</p>
                  <p>I had a great desire to get a little nearer,<note place="margin">The Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> and, if it were possible, to see the Saint's Sepulchre.
Whereupon, I return'd thither in the Evening, and set down in my Table-Book the <hi>Arabian</hi>
Inscriptions, which I found Grav'd here and there upon the Walls. The <hi>Persians,</hi> who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
what I did was in honour of their Saint, suffer'd me to proceed in what I was about. I
made my advantage of that liberty to slip in at the Gate of the second Court, where I found
many other Inscriptions. I bestow'd about half an hour in Copying them out, and perceiving
they took no further notice of me, I ventur'd so far as to open the Door which goes into the
structure it self, which being made fast only with a wooden pin, it was no hard matter for me
to open it, and to get in. It consisted of many arched apartments, which had no light, but what
came in by certain little Windows, which put me into a little fright. In the first apartment,
there was, just opposite to the door, a Tomb about two foot high, having as many steps to get
up to it, and it was encompass'd with a Balcony, or rather an Iron-grate.</p>
                  <p>On the left hand, there was a door which led into a great and very lightsome Gallery, the
walls whereof were whitened, and the floor cover'd with rich Carpets. On the right hand,
there were, in another apartment, which was Vaulted, eight high Tombs: and it was through
this last Vault, that people pass'd into a third, in which was the Sepulchre of <hi>Seid-Ibrahim.</hi>
The Tomb was two foot above ground, and was cover'd with a Carpet of yellow Damask. At
the head and feet, as also on both sides, there were several Wax Candles and Lanthorns, upon
great brass Candlesticks, and from the Roof of the Vault there hung certain Lamps. As I came
out of this place, I met with our Minister, who express'd so great a desire to go into it, that I
ventur'd once more to go in along with him; and he went in thither a second time along with
our Physician.</p>
                  <p>About two Musket shot from the Village,<note place="margin">The Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Saint.</note> on the East-side, there is to be seen, in a Rock,
the Sepulchre of another Saint, which is very sumptuously built. The <hi>Persians</hi> call the Saint
who is interr'd in that place <hi>Tirbabba,</hi> and they affirm he was Master to <hi>Scid-Ibrahim,</hi> who
had so great an Affection, and so particular a Reverence for him, that he made it his request to
God, that he would vouchsafe, that, after his Death, he might be seen in the same posture as he
was wont to put himself into, when he did his Devotions in his Life time; and that according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he is to be seen at this day clad in a grey Garment kneeling, which was his ordinary gesture
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47786:108"/>
when he said his Prayers, while he lived. Which a man need make no great difficulty to believe,
if there may be any credit given to what is affirmed by <hi>Camerarius,</hi> in his <hi>Historical Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
after <hi>Varro,</hi> and <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> to wit, that the Bodies of the <hi>Persians</hi> are
not corrupted, and that they are only dry'd up: I am of opinion, that this is to be understood
only of such Bodies as are not interr'd, but expos'd to the Air, nay it is further requisite they
should be Bodies brought very low either by age or sickness: for full Bodies are subject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
in <hi>Persia</hi> as well as other places</p>
                  <p>These two places are very famous by reason of the Pilgrimages upon which the <hi>Persians</hi> resort
thither, especially about the time that <hi>Tiribabba</hi> hath a new Garment bestow'd on him, and
that the old one is torn to pieces, to be distributed among the Pilgrims. The Inhabitants of the
Country relate strange things of the Miracles of these Saints: but in regard they can be no other
than Fables, or the effects of Sorcery, and that the <hi>Persians</hi> are very apt to believe any stories,
and are very much inclin'd to Sorcery, I thought it more discretion to wave the relation of
their impertinences.</p>
                  <p>Upon the door of this Sepulchre, there was this Inscription in <hi>Arabick</hi> Letters, <hi>Alla mufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thi
hibebuad,</hi> that is to say, <hi>O God, open this door.</hi> There are cut within the Rock several Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Neeches, and Holes, in which the Pilgrims are lodg'd and do their Devotions; nay there
are some so high, that they must have Ladders of 12. or 15. foot long to get up to
them.</p>
                  <p>There were three of us ventur'd to get up to the top of the Rock by dreadful precipices, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one the other as we got up. There we found four spacious Chambers, and, within, several
Neeches cut in the Rock, to serve for Beds. But what we thought most strange was, that we
found in that Vault,<note place="margin">Shels in mountains far from the Sea.</note> upon the very top of the Mountain, Muscle-shels, and in some places such
abundance of them, as would induce a man to imagine, that the Rock was made up of sand and
shels. In our return from <hi>Persia,</hi> we observ'd all along the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, several of these shelly
Mountains. whereof we shall give a further accompt hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of this Village of <hi>Pyrmaraas</hi> never drink any Wine, out of a fear, as they
say themselves, that, breaking the Laws of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the Directions of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> the
Holiness of the place might be thereby prophan'd. At the entrance of the Village, near the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
of <hi>Seid-Ibrahim</hi> there is a great Vault, or Cestern of 52. foot in length and twenty in
breadth, compass'd with a wall of Free-stone, which in the Winter time they fill with Water,
Snow and Ice, to be us'd in the great heats and drought of Summer, as well for themselves as
their Cattel.</p>
                  <p>The 29. the <hi>Chan</hi> sent us word, that we might send our Harbinger to <hi>Schamachie,</hi> to take
up Lodgings for us, and that we might follow him in the afternoon. But after we had loaded
part of our Baggage, and just as we were going to take Horse, the <hi>Chan</hi> sent an express Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to us, to intreat us to continue that night at <hi>Pyrmaraas.</hi> And that we might be assur'd, this
was not done out of any design upon us, he sent us several refreshment, and among other
things, four great Pitchers, and two Leathern baggs full of Wine, good store of Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
Apples, Pears, Quinces and Chest-nuts, and to each of the Ambassadors an excellent
Horse sadled and bridled.<note place="margin">The super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>
                     </note> We could not then imagine what might occasion this delay; but it
was told us afterward, that the <hi>Minatzim,</hi> or Astrologer, belonging to the <hi>Chan,</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him, that that day was not a fortunate day to receive strangers in.</p>
                  <p>The next day,<note place="margin">The recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors at <hi>Schama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Dec.</hi> 30. we left <hi>Pyrmaraas,</hi> about eight in the Morning, taking our way
straight to <hi>Schamachy,</hi> into which we made a very noble entrance. Within two leagues of the
City, we met with one afoot, who came to tell us, from the <hi>Chan,</hi> that we were welcom, and
that he would come out of the City in person to receive us. This man march'd on still in the
front of our Cavalcade. Within a league of the City, we met with about thirty Gentlemen
on horse-back, very well mounted, who came only to take a view of us, and immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
in full speed, to the City. After this, we met, near a certain Village, with about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men on horse-back, who open'd, to make us way to pass through them.</p>
                  <p>About two Musket-shot thence we met with another Troop of Cavaliers, among whom
there were tweleve that had a particular Coiffure about their heads, having their Turbants point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upwards like the Spire of a Steeple, which they call <hi>Takia;</hi> and we were told it was by Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
that they were so dress'd, it being to signifie that they were of the posterity and kinred
of their Prophet <hi>Aaly.</hi> These saluted us with a low inclination of the head, and bid us wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
by saluting us with their <hi>Chosckeldi,</hi> in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Language, which they would rather
speak than the <hi>Persian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having kept company with these about half a League, we perceiv'd on our right hand a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of about 500. men; and whereas we were told, that the <hi>Chan</hi> and his <hi>Calenter,</hi> or Lieutenant,
were there in person, it was taken into consideration, whether we should keep on in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
or turn aside and make-towards them. The Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> would have had us
keep on in the High-way, which led streight to the City, alleging that it was the <hi>Chan</hi>'s duty,
who receiv'd us, and who ought to be his own Master of the Ceremonies, to come to us. But
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47786:108"/>
our <hi>Mehemandar,</hi> and others of the Company assuring us, that the High-way was very deep
and dirty, and that the fields were more fit for the reception of the Ambassadors, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
and Ceremonies occasion'd thereby,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Schama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi> meets the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.</note> they prevail'd with us, so that we went streight
towards the <hi>Chan,</hi> who stay'd for us upon a little Hill, and advanc'd towards the Ambassadors,
as soon as he perceiv'd them coming up. He had on his right hand six men, very proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Arm'd with gilt Bows and Arrows; on his left, as many of his Guard, with their Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
and after him came a very great number of Gentlemen on Horse-back, very well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and clad in Garments of <hi>Brocado,</hi> and Mantles and Caps embroider'd with Gold and Silver.
Being come up to us, he would needs do our Nation the greatest honour imaginable, which was
by taking the Ambassadors one after the other by the hand, contrary to the custom of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>
The first Complements over, he commanded Wine to be pour'd into a silver Vessel,
drunk to the Ambassadors, and oblig'd each of them to pledge him twice.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Calenter,</hi> and <hi>Muscovian Poslanick, Alexei Sauinouits,</hi> who were about the <hi>Chan,</hi> bid
us also heartily welcom, and took us by the hand.</p>
                  <p>As we march'd along, we had before us our loud Musick, which consisted in Hawboyes,
Timbrels, Cornets, and Tabours, but particularly in a kind of Instrument, called <hi>Kerrenai.</hi>
These are made somewhat like our Hawboyes, save that they are of Brass, being above eight
foot in length, and at the extremity, above two foot Diameter. There were four of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
and those who play'd on them made a halt ever and anon, and stood in a Circle as
our Trumpeters, holding up the end of their <hi>Kerrenai</hi> to the sky, and making a noise, which
hath not only nothing of harmony in it. but is more like a dreadful howling than any thing of
Musick. There were also common Hawboyes, which they call <hi>Surnatzi,</hi> and earthen Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels,
made like our Butter-pots. Having march'd on a little way in this Company, the <hi>Chan</hi>
ordered all to make a second halt, that the Ambassadors might drink, causing in the mean time,
a certain Buffoon, or Jeaster, one of those whom they call <hi>Tazusch,</hi> to make wry-faces, and
shew a thousand postures. He also used Castagnets, and sung very pleasant songs.</p>
                  <p>Within a quarter of a League of the City, there was a body or battalion of above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
foot, most <hi>Armenians.</hi> This battalion consisted of five Regiments, distinguish'd one from
the other by so many Colours, which were fasten'd to the top of a great and long Pole, so as
that it was as much as a man could do to carry one of them. They had their particular musick,
consisting of Pipes and other Instruments, one whereof was very remarkable, and consisted of
two brass Basins, which they struck one against the other. All these people bid us also very
welcome, and express'd their joy at our arrival, some by clapping their hands, others by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Caps about their heads, or flinging them up into the air. There the Governour
commanded a third halt to be made, that the Ambassadors might drink once more. Coming
near the City-Gate, we were entertain'd with another band of musick, consisting of Timbrells.
Hawboyes, Trumpets, and other Instruments, which joyning with those of our Company made
such a noyse as would have drown'd Thunder it self.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chan</hi> invited the Ambassadors with the chiefest of their Retinue to Supper, and made
them cross the Court on horse-back, till they came to the Lodgings into which they were to
go; but the Gentlemen, and the rest of the Retinue were oblig'd to alight at the outer Gate.
The floors of all the Chambers were cover'd with very rich Tapistry. The <hi>Persians</hi> took off
their shooes before they went into the Chambers; which put us to so much the greater trouble,
in that being all, in riding-boots, we durst not venture to go in, till some of the <hi>Chans</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks
took some of the more forward by the hand and brought them in; without putting us
to the trouble of pulling off our Boots.</p>
                  <p>We pass'd through three very fair Chambers, and were brought into a spacious Hall very
sumptuously furnish'd, and hung with excellent pieces of Painting, representing those parts
which are not commonly seen naked. In the midst of the Hall, there was a Fountain, the cast
of the water representing the form of a Glass. They had set, to cool, all about the Fountain,
several silver Flaggons, and Bottles of Wine; and there were several Tables cover'd with all
sorts of Conserves,<note place="margin">Allows them seats; contrary to the custom,</note> The Governour knowing we were not accustomed to sit down after the
<hi>Persian</hi> way, had caused seats to be made, and the more to oblige the Ambassadors, he sate
down, after our way of sitting, opposite to the Fountain, causing the Ambassadors to sit down
on his right hand, and on his left, but upon the ground, the <hi>Calenter</hi> or Lieutenant, the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natschim</hi>
or Astrologer, his Physician, and several other persons of Quality. The Gentlemen
and Officers belonging to the Ambassadors sate down on the floor, the other side of the
Hall.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Musicians</hi> stood before the <hi>Chan.</hi> At the entrance of the Hall there were several
young men, very handsom persons, having on Garments of <hi>Brocado,</hi> with their Bows and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
in the posture of shooting. All that were in the Hall, whether sitting or standing, had
their backs to the Wall, and their faces towards the <hi>Chan</hi> and the company, so as that not one

There were brought to the Company several little Tables cover'd with Fruits and Conserves,
to be serv'd to two at a time, while two Pages went round the Hall to fill Wine, it being all
they had to do,<note place="margin">The services of the Feast.</note> unless it were, when they had ended one round, to begin another. After eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one had eaten some few Conserves, they were taken away, and the like Tables were cover'd
with a very fine Cotton-cloath of several colours, to serve the Meat upon. About an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Meat was taken away, and Conserves were served up again, and after that began the
Preparatives for Supper. The little Tables were taken away, that the whole Hall might be
cover'd, upon the Tapistry, with great pieces of Linnen, which were to serve for a kind of
Table-cloath. The Butler having done his duty, the Carver comes in with a great Wooden
Dish full of a certain thin bak'd Past.<note place="margin">A strange sort of Napkins.</note> The <hi>Persians</hi> call it <hi>Iucha,</hi> and every piece is above three

were set in the midst of the Hall, where the <hi>Suffretzi,</hi> or Carver, kneeling down, cut it into
pieces, and dispos'd it into little Dishes, whereof every one had one brought him.</p>

                  <p>We had Musick, while we were at Meal. The Musick consisted of Lutes and Viols, very

The two Pages who had fill'd the Wine at the Collation, danc'd to the sound of all these Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:

Palace lyeth upon the ascent of a little Hill, whence might be discover'd all the houses about the
City; and he had commanded all the Inhabitants to set a row of Lamps in their windows,
which represented to our eyes above twenty thousand Stars, enough to dispel the greatest dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the night, and added much to the divertisement, which they endeavoured to give all our
senses, while the Musick of the Hawboyes and Timbrels made all the Rampiers of the City to
resound again.</p>

them observe one of the Lamps that stood near them, to see whether he struck it out with the
first Musket-shot: which he did twice together, without missing any one time. This Feast ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lasted till it was somewhat late in the night, and that we began to think it a little cold, the
Governour carry'd us into another Room with a fire in it,<note place="margin">One of the company kills him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with drinking Aquavitae.</note> where he call'd for Conserves, Wine,

who never had drunk any before, and would needs do it out of complyance to us, took so much
of it, that the next day he was found dead in his bed.</p>
                  <p>After this treatment, which lasted till midnight, the <hi>Chan</hi> permitted us to withdraw, and
assign'd us Lodging among the <hi>Armenians,</hi> because they were <hi>Christians;</hi> but in regard our
Hosts had had no notice of our coming, and that our Baggage was not yet arriv'd, we found
neither Beds, nor Benches, nor Tables, so that after so good a Supper, we had a very ill night
of it.</p>
                  <p>The last day of <hi>December,</hi> the <hi>Chan</hi> sent the Ambassadors several refreshments, Wine, wild
Fowl, and other Provisions. The <hi>Calenter</hi> or Lieutenant ordered to be allow'd us for our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Provision, seventeen Sheep, twenty Pullers, a hundred Eggs, a certain quantity of Salt, and
Bread, fifty quarts of Wine, and twenty burthens of Wood. This was very punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
for the four or five first dayes; but the <hi>Mehemander</hi> being oblig'd to get in these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
out of the neighbouring Villages, which he could not so procure but that it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
three or four dayes ere we could get our allowance, the <hi>Chan</hi> sent us word, that it were
more for our convenience to send to the Market for our Provisions, and that we might be assur'd,
that what we laid out should be reimburs'd at our departure thence. To that purpose, he
caus'd it to be Proclaim'd by sound of Trumpet, that all Provisions should be sold to the <hi>Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui</hi>

Ceremonies of their Enterrments, and therefore shall give no futher accompt of it here, than
that ordinarily the Bodies are carried into the <hi>Metzid, Mosquey</hi> or Church, whence they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

them, Conserves and Wine, for the Collation. The <hi>Chan</hi>'s design was, to hear our Musick,
whereof he had heard much talk; and accordingly, he was so taken therewith, that he impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
the Ambassadors to go and sup with him at the Castle, and to bring their Musick along
with them. It consisted of a Violin, a Base-Viol, a Bandore, and a Voice. The Ambassadors
would at first have put him off, but his instances were such, that they could not possibly do it;
insomuch that we pass'd away the remainder of that day, in the same Divertisements as he had
entertain'd us with the first day of our arrival. Only there was this extraordinary, that the
Governour ordered to be brought out of the Stable some of his best Horses, to the number of
twenty seven, among which there were three, which the <hi>Sophy</hi> had sent him, not long before,
as so many assurances of his favour. He caus'd one of the Gentlemen belonging to his Chamber
to mount them all, and to take several turns thereon about the Hall, though the floor were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with very rich Tapistry.</p>

the next day, at the Ceremonies performed by the <hi>Armenians</hi> at the Consecration of

sixth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> which is the day of the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> or appearance of the Star to the Kings or
Wise-men. They began it with a Mass, which was said betimes in the morning before day.
After Mass there was a Sermon preach'd, the former being said in a manner with the same Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
as the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> do it in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, assist at their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> The Ambassadors, whose Lodgings were
near the Chapel of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> made no difficuly to be present at both Mass and Sermon;
and after the latter, they were Complemented by the Bishop who had Preach'd it, and who
came purposely for that Exercise, from the place of his ordinary residence.</p>
                     <p>He gave them to understand by an Interpreter, how glad he was to see their Devotions ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
by the Presence of Persons of that quality, since it could be no small comfort to them,
to see in their Churches <hi>Europaean</hi> Christians, who had never come into them before. Whereto
he added, that their Excellencies the Ambassadors knew not who he was, but that he should
find a time to acquaint them therewith: from which Discourse of his we inferr'd, that he was
some Missionary of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s, sent into these parts, to endeavour the Re-union of the <hi>Gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Church with the <hi>Roman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He further intreated the Ambassadors, to use their Mediation to the Governour, that they
might be permitted to carry on the building of a Monastery, which the <hi>Armenians</hi> had begun;
which they promised to do.</p>
                     <p>About noon the <hi>Armenians,</hi> by order from the Governour, brought us fifteen Horses, upon
which we rode to the River, which is about half a League from the City. Those poor people,
who were come to the City from all the adjacent Villages, went out of it in Procession, with
abundance of Images, Crosses and Banners, guarded to the River-side by a strong part of Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which the Governour had assign'd them, for their Protection against the injuries and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
of the <hi>Mussulmans,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who make it thier sport to abuse them. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
had caus'd a Tent to be pitch'd over against the place, where the Consecr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tion was to
be performed, very richly hung with Tapistry, and had ordered a sumptuous Collation to be
made ready in it. There were on his left hand the <hi>Muscovian Poslanick,</hi> and a great number of
Gentlemen, and the right he had kept void for the Ambassadors, and some of their retinue.
After he had receiv'd us,<note place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Water.</note> and made us sit down, he commanded the <hi>Armenians</hi> to begin their
Ceremonies. As soon as they begun Reading, at the River-side, four men, stark naked, leap'd
into the water, and swum up and down for a certain time, to open the water, which was a
little frozen over. One of our Spaniels, which was wont to go into the water,
leap'd in after them: which found the <hi>Persians</hi> excellent sport, who look upon
a Dog as so unclean a kind of Creature, that they would not willingly one should touch
them; insomuch that they laugh'd to see the Ceremonies of the <hi>Armenians</hi> prophan'd by our
Water-Dog; though indeed they look on all those poor people do as so much mummery. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Governour himself makes his advantage thereof, inasmuch as the pains he takes to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thereat, and consequently to protect those of that Profession, brings him in yearly a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of a thousand Crowns from their Churches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:47786:110"/>
After the Bishop had read for an hour or better, and the Assembly given over singing and
playing on the Timbrels, he pour'd a little Consecrated Oyl into the Water, into which he
afterwards dipp'd a little Cross beset with abundance of Precious Stones, and at last, holding
his Crosier over the Water, he gave it his Benediction.</p>
                     <p>After that Ceremony, all the <hi>Armenians</hi> took of it, some to drink, others to wash their
faces withall. There were some among them cast themselves into it, but most took only so
much of it as to sprinkle their faces therewith. Some of the Governours Domesticks made it
their sport to dash the Priests and the Women, nay some were so uncivil with them, that the
<hi>Chan</hi> himself was asham'd of it, and oblig'd to command them to forbear their rudenesses:
though he himself made his Jester and others of his Servants Dance, purposely to abouse the
<hi>Armenians,</hi> who Danced about their Bishop. The Governours Physician, who was an <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi>
born, and a person of no Religion, had the Impudence to ask the Ambassadors, what
they thought of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and whether they believ'd him to be the Son of God. Answer
was made him, that they believ'd him to be the True God, but that it was uncivilly done of
the Physician to laugh at their Religion, and that they were not come thither to dispute it with
him.</p>
                     <p>All the Ceremonies being over, they fell very seriously a-drinking, and the Governour took
his Liquor so liberally, that being well nigh Drunk, he left the Company, and got on Hors-back,
without taking leave of any one. All the rest of the <hi>Persians</hi> follow'd him; which we
were so much the more surpriz'd at, inasmuch as, not acquainted with their custom, we could
not imagine what should be the reason of his going away: Being got on Horse-back, in order to
our return for the City, we met with the Governour, who staid for the Ambassadors not far
from the Tent. We understood afterwards, and indeed found it by exprience, that the <hi>Persians</hi>
think it not much, to rise from Table, and go their ways, without making Excuse or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
to those by whom they were entertain'd, who for their parts take the same privilege
to do the like with those whom they had invited, when they find themselves in such a condition
as that they are not able to keep them company any longer. Of this we had man instances, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our aboad in <hi>Persia,</hi> and that sometimes, at the <hi>Schach</hi>'s own Table.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ianuary</hi> 9. the <hi>Armenian</hi> Bishop gave the Ambassadors a Visit. He came to their Lodgings
with the Cross and Banner, having many Priests marching before him, who were all in their
Pontifical Robes, with Wax-Candles in their hands. As they came into the Court, they fell
a singing and playing on their Timbrels, Hawboies, and little Bells, and brought us a present of
two Pitchers of Wine, and a dish of Apples, in the midst whereof they had planted a Wax-Candle
lighted. They were above three hours in discourse with the Ambassadors, concerning
the business of their Religion, and when they took leave of them, they re-iterated the intreaty
they had made to them before, of employing their intercession to the Governour, for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ian.</hi> 10. The <hi>Calenter,</hi> or King's Lieutenant, entertain'd the Ambassadors and all their reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
at a very great Feast:<note place="margin">The <hi>Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Feast.</note> but before we sate down, he would needs give us the satisfaction to
see his Palace, which was incomparably both better built and furnish'd than the Governour's.
The Hall, where we were to Dine, was all arched and set out with a certain Plaister-work done
in Leaves and Branches, which argu'd much the Ingenuity of the Inventor. The Hall looked
into a very spacious and very fair Garden; the situation whereof, we thought so much the more
advantageous, in that the Hall being high, and the Garden very low, it might be all seen out
of the Windows thereof. On one side of the Hall there was a Gallery, out of which issu'd a
Fountain, which casting its water at first very high, charm'd us with a low, but delighful noise,
which the water thereof made by falling into another lower Basin opposite to a Chamber under
the Hall, and thence into a third which was in the midst of the Garden. The Governour, who
was also at this entertainment, with the chiefest of his Courtiers, had brought thither along
with him the Marshal of the <hi>Sophy</hi>'s Court, who was then newly come from <hi>Ispaban.</hi> The
Feast lasted till night, which being somewhat dark the <hi>Persians</hi> brought us to our Quarters
with Torches: though they themselves were so well furnish'd, as to stand in need of conductors,
at least as much as we did.</p>

ten Ells of Scarler, five Ells of blew Satin, a Barrel of Aquavitae, a Chest, or Cellar, in which
they sent him two dozen Bottles of all sorts of Spirits of Wine, and two pair of Knives, the
hafts whereof were of Amber. This Present put him into so good an Humour, that we thought
it a seasonable time,<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to build a Church.</note> to present to him the Petition of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> concerning the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Church.</p>
                     <p>In answer to which, he told, us that although, ever since the establishment of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi>
Religion in <hi>Persia,</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> never were permitted to build a Church at <hi>Schamachie,</hi> and
that accordingly, it never had been his intention to suffer the <hi>Armenians</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> any; yet
such was the respect he had for the Intercession of the Ambassadors in their behalf, that they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47786:110"/>
might assure themselves, he would no longer oppose it: and that they might have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to doubt his reality herein, he would needs have the Orders for that purpose dispatch'd in
their presence.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Armenians</hi> were so over-joy'd thereat, that, not thinking it enough to give the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
their humblest thanks, they promised so to order things, that their intended Structure
should acquaint posterity with their Names, and the Good Offices they had done them upon
that occasion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ian.</hi> 20. came back the Courier, or Express, whom the <hi>Chan</hi> had sent to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we left <hi>Niasabath;</hi> upon which the Ambassadors sent to him, to desire him to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to them the Orders of the Court, concerning the prosecution of their Journey. Answer
was made us, that he had not receiv'd any new Orders at all, and that, if we desired it, we
might hear the Letter read, which he thereupon gave his Physician to read. The Physician, a
person the fittest in the World to represent a Fool in a play, after he had kiss'd the Letter, put
it to his forehead, and at last read it. The Contents of it, at least what he read, was to this
effect; That the Express from the <hi>Sulthan</hi> of <hi>Derbent</hi> being come to the Court, before him
whom the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Schamachie</hi> had sent, all the account he had brought, was, that there was
arriv'd at <hi>Derbent</hi> any Envoy, or <hi>Poslanick,</hi> from the Great Duke of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that, within a few days, there would come into those parts certain Ambassadors from
one of the Princes of <hi>Germany:</hi> That the <hi>Schach,</hi> who had receiv'd no other accompt of their
arrival, thought it enough to order the Governour of <hi>Derbent</hi> to receive them, to entertain
then kindly, during the stay they should make there, and to supply them with all things for
the continuation of their journey, as far as <hi>Schamachie,</hi> and that when they were come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Schamachie</hi> should send an Express to give an accompt thereof to the
Court, from which he should immediately receive orders what to do, as well in respect of the
maintenance of the Ambassadors, as their departure thence. The <hi>Chan</hi> demanded of us a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of the names and qualities of all of our Retinue; nay, he would have had it express'd in
the said Catalogue, what Professions they were of, and that we should not fail setting down,
that we had among us a Physician, a Chyrurgeon, a Painter, and Musicians; which we would
not do; but thought it sufficient, to give them, in writing, only the names of our people, and
the Offices, and employments they were in, upon the accompt of the Embassy. We had a
great suspicion that the said Letter came not from the Court, and that there was somewhat
more or less in it, and the more to be assur'd of it, we got the Courier to come the next day
to our quarters. The Wine we gave him, and the small Presents which were secretly made
him, unlock'd the man's breast, and drew out the whole secret. He told us, upon promise of
secrecy, that the Governours Brother, having been, not long before executed, and that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
having, in some measure, engag'd the whole Family in the disgrace of the deceas'd, there
was not any man durst undertake the delivery of his Letter to the <hi>Sophy,</hi> as being ignorant what
the contents thereof might be: but that after a moneths delay, one of the Kings Chamberlains ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ventured to lay it at his Majesties feet, the <hi>Sofi</hi> would make no answer at all thereto, but
ordered another to write to him, and sent him word, that there was no answer to be made to

                     <p>
                        <hi>February</hi> the fifth,<note place="margin">FEBRU.</note> walking abroad with some of our company, we went into a great house
near the Market-place,<note place="margin">A College for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Youth.</note> which they call <hi>Basar.</hi> It was a very noble Structure, having many
Galleries and Chambers, like a College. Meeting up and down with several persons, some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
some young, some walking, some sitting, with books in their hands, we had the curiosity
to enquire what place it was, and found that it was a School or College, which they called <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresa,</hi>
of which kind there are very many all over <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While we were viewing the Structure, one of their <hi>Maderis,</hi> or Regents, who read publick
Lectures, intreated us to come near him, and perceiving that I had caus'd to be graven upon a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47786:111"/>
Cane I walk'd with all these words in Arabick,<note place="margin">1637.</note> 
                        <hi>Bismi alla, rahman rachim,</hi> that is, <hi>in the name
of the merciful God who sheweth mercy</hi> (a sentence which the <hi>Persians</hi> put at the beginning of
their writings) he desired me to bestow it on him, upon a promise that he would give me a
better the next day: but finding I made some difficulty to part with it, he cut out the word <hi>alla,</hi>
which in their Language is the proper name of God, and put what he had cut off in a piece of
clean paper, very gently and carefully, and told me, the name of God ought not to be written
upon a walking stick, which was many times thrust into the dirt.</p>
                     <p>The next day I went again to the same College, whether I had caus'd to be brought along
with me a very fair Celestial Globe, but, by mistake, I went to another School, where never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
they receiv'd me very kindly. The Professors and Regents, as also the Students, very
much wondred to see me come with so noble a Globe, and to understand thereby, that Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and the Mathematicks were better taught among us than in <hi>Persia,</hi> where they are not yet
acquainted with the invention of Globes, and make use only of the Astrolabe, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of their Students. They took much delight in viewing my Globe, and they
nam'd to me in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Language all the Signs of the Zodiack, nay, gave me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
further, that they knew all the names, and all the significations of most of the other
Stars.</p>
                     <p>Another day,<note place="margin">A School for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> I went into a <hi>Metzid,</hi> or Church, in that part of the Town where we were
quarter'd, to see, how they instructed their Children. They were all sate against the Wall,
excepting only the <hi>Molla,</hi> or Master of the School, who, with some other aged persons, sate
in the midst of the Hall. As soon as they saw me coming in, they invited me to sit down by
them. The <hi>Molla,</hi> who had an <hi>Alchoran</hi> in his hand, very fairly written, suffered me to
turn it over awhile, which when I had done, he took it back from me, kiss'd it, at the beggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and would have given it me to kiss also: but I only kiss'd another book I had in my hand,
and told him, that, knowing well what book I had my self, I made no difficulty to kiss it, but
not understanding what was contained in his book, I should not be too forward to honour it so
much. He laugh'd and told me I had done very well. There was among them an <hi>Arabian</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Chalil,</hi> who was a <hi>Minatsim,</hi> or Astrologer, born at <hi>Hetsa,</hi> near <hi>Meca,</hi> aged about 65.
years. He understood Astrology, and read <hi>Enclid</hi> to some of his Disciples. I presently knew
the book by the figures in it, and made him some demonstations, as well as I could express my
self in the <hi>Persian</hi> Language: whereat the good old man was so much pleas'd, that desirous, on
his part, to shew me what he could do, he took out of his bosom a little brass Astrolabe, and
ask'd me, whether I had ever seen the like, or understood the use of it. Whereto having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
him, that I understood it very well, and that I had one at my Lodging, he seem'd to be
very desirous to see it, which oblig'd me to go home to fetch it, and to bring along with me the
Globe, which they wondred very much to see, especially when they understood that I had made
it my self. The honest <hi>Arabian</hi> desir'd me to shew him, how I could set down the Degrees so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
in regard they have no Instruments wherewith to make their Circles and Degrees. I
shew'd him the invention of it, and how in a short time, and with little trouble he might attain
thereto, for which discovery, he acknowledg'd himself very much oblig'd to me, insomuch that
ever after, he let slipno occasion, whereby he might assure me of his friendship, expressing it as
well by his frequent visits, coming one day with abundance of excellent fruit, and dishes of meat
ready dress'd purposely to Dine with me at his own charges, as by his earnest proffers of all the
service that lay in his power. He gave me the Longitudes and Latitudes of the chiefest Cities
and places of all <hi>Asia,</hi> which I compared with the observations I had my self made thereof, and
found them very exact.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Molla,</hi> or Master of the <hi>Metzid,</hi> was called <hi>Maheb Aaly,</hi> and was a very young, but
mighty good natur'd man, and of an excellent humour, one who did all that lay in his power to
serve me, doing me the greatest kindnesses he could upon all occasions, especially in my study of
the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue. He brought me also acquainted with a certain friend of his, named <hi>Iman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi,</hi>
who was an <hi>Ohnbaschi,</hi> or Captain of a Troop of Horse. These two came to see me eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day alternately, as well to teach me their Language as to learn mine. Which they did with
very great improvement dayly, especially <hi>Imanculi,</hi> who no doubt had in a short time arriv'd
to the perfection of it, had it not been for the envy or jealousie of some of our own, which
prov'd so great, as to make it suspected, that those poor people had some design to change their
Religion: so that they were forc'd to keep out of the way, and for the most part to make their
visits in the night. Insomuch that one day, to wit, <hi>Febr.</hi> 11. being gone to the <hi>Metzid,</hi> to
take a Lesson in the Language, there came thither a <hi>Persian</hi> servant, to tell the <hi>Molla,</hi> from the
Governour, that he much wondred, how he durst suffer those Christians to come into their
Temple, that they had nothing to do there, and that it was his best course to dismiss them. The
<hi>Molla</hi> was, at first, a little startled thereat, but upon second thoughts, considering with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that the <hi>Persians</hi> are never forbidden the company or conversation of <hi>Christians,</hi> he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this was some trick put upon him; and having taken the servant aside, he understood from
him, that it was not the <hi>Chan,</hi> but our Interpreter who had sent him, to hinder my study of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47786:111"/>
the Language. The next day, we had such another Message sent us; but we knew before both
the Author and occasion of it, and therefore made no accompt thereof. Some time after, there
hapning some difference between the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> and our Interpreter, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
that it was by order from his Excellency, that he had sent the said servant, to hinder my
learning of the Language. Upon the same accompt was it that the said Ambassador ordered me
to reduce <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Turkie</hi> into one Map, that so I might be taken off the study of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
at least as long as I should be employ'd about that teadious and troublesome piece of
work.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Febr.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">An <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> Monk vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.</note> the Ambassadors were visited by a Monk, a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> named <hi>Ambrosio dos
Anios,</hi> born at <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Portugal.</hi> The accompt he gave of himself, was, that he came from
<hi>Tiflis</hi> in <hi>Georgia,</hi> which lies about ten dayes journey from <hi>Scanachie,</hi> where he was Prior of a
Monastery of the Order of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and that he had undertaken that journey out of no
other design, than upon the news he had heard, that a Potent Prince of <hi>Germany</hi> had sent a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Embassy into <hi>Persia,</hi> and that he could not imagine, it should be upon any accompt so
much as the advancement of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion in those parts: That he had been the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be at the trouble of that journey, out of the hope he had, that their Excellencies the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
would not take it ill that he had taken the freedom to wait on them; not only to
congratulate their happy arrival in <hi>Persia,</hi> but also to serve them in any thing lay in his power:
That he had been seven and twenty years in the Kingdom, and that during so long a Tract of
time, he had not been so negligent in inquiring into the affairs of the Countrey, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the Nation, as that he might not be in some measure serviceable to them in their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation.</p>
                     <p>We knew not, upon the first proposal, what to imagine of the intentions of this Religious
Man, and therefore we thought fit to stand as it were upon our Guard, till that after ten dayes
conversation with him, we really found him sincere in all his proceedings, insomuch that we
made no difficulty to trust him absolutely in all things. Besides the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> which was his
Mother-Tongue, and the Latine, in which he entertrain'd the Ambassadors, he understood also
the <hi>Georgian,</hi> the <hi>Turkish,</hi> and the <hi>Persian</hi> Languages, for the attaining of which last, he gave
me many excellent directions.</p>
                     <p>About this time, many of our people were troubled with burning Feavers, which was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of their abundant drinking of Wine, after the much VVater they had been forc'd to
drink before. The VVine of <hi>Persia</hi> is very good, but strong, and our people drunk so freely
of it, that the Ambassadors were forc'd to forbid the use thereof by a very strict order. There
were two and twenty of them kept their Beds at the same time, but by Gods mercy, and through
the extraordinary care of the Physician, not one dyed.</p>
                     <p>The same day,<note place="margin">A Feast in memory of <hi>Haly.</hi>
                        </note> which is, according to the accompt of the <hi>Persians,</hi> the 21. day of <hi>Ramesan,</hi>
they celebrated their <hi>Auschur,</hi> or solemn Feast, in memory of <hi>Haly,</hi> their great Saint and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.
The Ceremonies and Devotions were performed in a House built for that purpose, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the City. The Governour, his <hi>Calenter,</hi> and the other chief Officers, were in a Gallery of
the said House, and opposite to the Gallery, there was an open Chair, about eight foot high,
which was plac'd under a piece of Linnen Cloath which had been pitch'd there,<note place="margin">A <hi>Persian</hi> Priest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly dress'd.</note> for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the <hi>Chatib,</hi> that is, their Prelate, who sat in the said Chair, clad in a blew Garment,
which is the Mourning-Colour of that Country. He spent above two hours in reading in a
Book, which they call <hi>Machtelnama,</hi> containing the Life and Actions of <hi>Haly,</hi> singing with a
loud and dolefull, yet clear and intelligible Voice, and that without any intermission, unless it
were when he came to some remarkable Passage, or some Moral Sentence, whereof he only
said the first Word, leaving the rest to be sung out by the other Priests, whereof there stood a
great number about the Chair. One of those Priests cry'd out at the end of every passage, <hi>Lua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
Chudai ber kuschendi Aaly bad,</hi> that is, <hi>Gods Curse be on him who kill'd Haly:</hi> whereto the
whole Assembly answer'd, <hi>bisch bad kem bad,</hi> that is, <hi>rather more than less.</hi> When he comes
to the passage where <hi>Haly</hi> said to his Children, (there are some believe he was well skill'd in
Judiciary Astrology, and that he fore-saw his own Death) that he should not live long, and
that it would not be long ere he were kill'd by one of his Domesticks, discovering it should be
<hi>Abdurraman ibni Meltzem,</hi> upon which the Children, with tears in their eyes, intreat him,
to be carefull of his Person, and rather to prevent <hi>Abdurraman,</hi> then suffer them, upon his
Death, to become Orphans, destitute of all Comfort, and expos'd to the discretion of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies;
when the <hi>Chathib,</hi> I say, comes to this place, you shall see the <hi>Persians</hi> weep and sob
most bitterly; as they do also when the <hi>Chathib</hi> represents how <hi>Haly</hi> was kill'd in their <hi>Metzid,</hi>
as he was at Prayers,<note place="margin">A Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> and the desolate condition his Children were in upon his Death. When
the <hi>Chathib</hi> hath given over Reading, the <hi>Chan</hi> sends him a Garment of Silk, which he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
puts on, and then there were conducted, in Procession, three Camels carrying Coffins,
cover'd with black Cloath, to represent those of <hi>Haly,</hi> and his two Sons, <hi>Hassan</hi> and <hi>Hossein.</hi>
After that follow'd two Chests cover'd with blew Cloath, in which were the Books and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Treatises written by <hi>Haly.</hi> Then came two excellent Horses, having at the Pommel of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47786:112"/>
the Saddles, andupon the Saddles, several Bows, Arrows, Turbants, and Flaggs. After them
march'd one man alone, carrying upon the top of a long pole a kind of Tower or Steeple, in
which there were thrust four Cimiters, but they were cover'd with so many Ribbons, and other
Toyes, that they could hardly be perceived: and at last many men carrying on their Heads
little Boxes cover'd with Feathers, and Flowers of several colours, in which the <hi>Alchoran</hi> lay
open.</p>
                     <p>These last Danc'd and Leap'd, in cadence to a certain dolefull Musick of Hawboyes, Timbrels,
Flageolets and Tabors. On the other side, many young Boyes Danc'd and Sung together,
clapping one another upon the shoulders, and crying <hi>Heder, Heder,</hi> which is the name of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Hassan, Hossein;</hi> and with these Ceremonies they took their way towards the City. Upon
this day the Death of <hi>Haly</hi> is celebrated all over <hi>Persia:</hi> but <hi>Mahomet,</hi> their great Prophet,
hath no particular Festival.</p>
                     <p>The 14. of <hi>February,</hi> was the new Moon, at which ends the Lent of the <hi>Persians,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the 16. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> which according to their accompt is the first of <hi>Ramesan;</hi> but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it was the eve of their Sabbath,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors treated by the <hi>Chan.</hi>
                        </note> which is Friday, their Ecclesiasticks thought fit to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the Fast till that day. The next day after the Feast, the <hi>Chan</hi> made a great Entertainment
for all the Grandees of his Court, to which he invited also the Ambassadors with their retinue,
and treated them very Magnificently.</p>
                     <p>The 27.<note place="margin">An order from the Court for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</note> came back the Courrier, whom the <hi>Chan</hi> had dispatch'd thence ever since the 21.
with express orders for our departure, with the first convenience, for <hi>Ispahan.</hi> This good news
put some of us into an humour to go a Hunting. The Governour lent us his excuses, that, some
business of importance intervening, he could not go along with us; however, he sent us his
Huntsmen, his Hounds, and his Hawks; as also a Leopard, which, being Excellently well
taught, started with as much swiftness as a Grey-hound, and gave us all the satisfaction Hunting
could afford. He discover'd no Hare which he took not, and came on at the least call, with
more command than any Setting Dog, leaping up behind the person who had the ordering of
him. The <hi>Chan</hi> had in the mean time caus'd a sumptuous Collation to be made ready for us in
his own Garden, without the City; but the person he had sent to invite us to pass that way,
mist the Company, and overtook us not till we were coming into the City; so that it being too
great a trouble for us to go then back again, he sent to our quarters some part of the Meat
which had been prepared for our Entertainment.</p>
                     <p>The first of <hi>March,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">MARCH</note> which according to their Almanack, called by them <hi>Taguim,</hi> is the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>Scheual,</hi> the <hi>Persians</hi> celebrated another Feast, which they call <hi>Chummehater,</hi> in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the day, on which <hi>Haly</hi> took possession of the Estate of his Cousin and Father-in-law
<hi>Mahomet.</hi> The <hi>Chan</hi> treated us again this day very Magnificently, near the River under a
Tent, where, during the time of the Entertainment, he gave us the Divertisements of several
sorts of Dances, and among others that of a Youth of about twenty years of age, who Danc'd
to the Musick of two little Cimbals, which he himself play'd on excellently well; as also that
of a <hi>Moor,</hi> or black <hi>Arabian,</hi> who leap'd and danc'd between the Porcelane Dishes, wherein
the Meat had been brought up, with such exactness, that he broke not one. Nay, as it should
seem, all the people were willing to contribute to our Divertisement, by the publick Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which fill'd every street: And the <hi>Chan</hi> himself would needs give us another tryal of his
skill at the Bow. He told us that heretofore he had cut a Hair with his Arrow, at a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
distance, and that he would try, whether he could do as much at the age he was of then,
which was forty five years. Having therefore fasten'd to a Horses hair one of those Rings,
which the <hi>Persians</hi> make use of to bend their Bows, and commonly wear them upon their
Thumbs, and having caus'd the Boy that held it to stand at the distance of above six paces, he
cut it twice one after another with his Arrow. He also, with a Fire-lock, shot an Apple, which
he had caus'd to be cast into the Air.</p>
                     <p>In our return to the City, after an Entertainment which had lasted six hours, all the Officers
took occasion, in a spacious plain, to give us a Tryal of the swiftness of their Horses. I must
needs confess it is extraordinary, and that there is no English Horse comes near them: but it is
certain withall, that this is all they teach them. They also gave us the Divertisement of their
Engagements or Horse-back, and their manner of Skirmishing with their enemies, and shew'd
us an incredible and miraculous Activity, not only in casting their Switches, which, in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
they made use of instead of Javelins, Riding with full speed upon those whom they
pursu'd, but also in catching them in their hands when they were cast at them, and immediately
Darting them at the pursuers. Of all those engag'd in that Exercise, the <hi>Chan</hi>'s Master of the
Horse behav'd himself the best, and had bestow'd on him by way of recompence, one of the best
Horses out of his Master's Stable.</p>
                     <p>The third of <hi>March,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Another Festival.</note> the <hi>Persians</hi> celebrated another Feast, which they call <hi>Tzar Schembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur,</hi>
that is, the fourth sad Sabbath, and it is the next <hi>Wednesday</hi> before the Vernal Equinox,
by which they begin their year; of which they are perswaded, that this <hi>Wednesday</hi> is the most
unfortunate day. And this, they say, they know not only by Tradition, but also by Experience,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47786:112"/>
which hath discover'd to them, that there never happen'd any thing but misfortune to them that
day. Thence it comes, that they do not any business that day, they keep their Shops shut,
Swear not, nor make any Debauches; but above all things, take they an especial care, not to
pay away any Money that day, out of a fear, they should be oblig'd not to do any thing else
all the year after. There are some who spend the whole day in telling what Money they have
in their Houses: others go, without speaking a word by the way, to the River, for some wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherewith they sprinkle their Houses and Houshold-stuff, thinking by that means to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the misfortune which might befall them. If they meet with any one of their acquaintance,
as they return home-wards, they cast some water into his face with their hands, or haply, pour
the whole Pitcher full upon him: but this is a kindness they do only to their best friends, out of
a perswasion, that those who are so served, and have their Cloaths all wet, cannot fail being
happy all the year after. Young people that are not Married, find also their Divertisement at
this solemnity, which is, to walk up and down the Streets, or along the River side, playing
upon certain Timbrels of bak'd Earth, which they carry under their arms. Others carry great
Staves in their hands, and go up to their knees in the River, to dash those who come to fetch
water, either by casting it at them with their hands, or taking hold of them, to wet them, or
to rub their faces with the borders of their wet Garments, or haply they break the pitchers
with their Staves. These last are look'd upon as ill-presaging Birds, so that those who can
keep out of their clutches, think they have avoided many misfortunes that should have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them that year. Upon which accompt it is, that there are some, who to avoid meeting
with them, go and fetch in their water before day: but all these fopperies are done only in the
morning, for as soon as it is afternoon, they go a walking, and bestow the time in any of
their other ordinary Exercises. The Author of the Preface before the <hi>High-Dutch</hi> Translation
of the <hi>Kalusthan,</hi> says, that this Festival is Dedicated to Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and that it is in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
of his Baptism, that the <hi>Persians</hi> do all those Ceremonies. True it is indeed, that
the <hi>Persians</hi> have a certain Veneration for that Saint, and that they go, to this day, upon Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
to his Sepulchre at <hi>Damas,</hi> and it may be, that was the intention of him who institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this Feast; but now, there is no track to be seen of any such thing.</p>

the old) they celebrated the first day of their year, which they call <hi>Nauras,</hi> with great
solemnity. For though they commonly count their years from the <hi>Hegira,</hi> or the day of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>'s
flight, from <hi>Meca</hi> to <hi>Medina,</hi> which is their <hi>Epoche,</hi> and co-incident with the 16
of <hi>Iuly,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of 12, Lunar moneths.</note> according to our Almanacks; yet so it is, that, their year, consisting only of twelve
Lunar moneths, and consequently being eleven days shorter than ours, they take a certain day
for the beginning of their year, which is that, on which the Sun enters <hi>Aries,</hi> at the Vernal
Equinox, in what quarter of the Moon soever it happens; but of this we shall give a further
accompt elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadors sent some of us to the Castle to complement the <hi>Chan</hi> upon the beginning
of the new year, and to wish him a good one. We found him at Table, having near him
the <hi>Minatzim,</hi> or Astrologer, who rose up ever and anon, and taking his Astrolabe, went to
observe the Sun, and at the very moment that the Sun came to the <hi>Equator,</hi> he publish'd the
new year, the beginning whereof was celebrated by the firing of some great Guns, both from
the Castle and the City-Walls, and at the same time, there might be heard a Musick of all
sorts of instruments. Opposite to the <hi>Chan</hi> sat one of their Orators, whom they call <hi>Kasiechuan,</hi>
who made an Oration, intermixt with more Faces and Gestures than any Player can shew on
the Stage, speaking only of the Victories obtained by the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> over the <hi>Turks,</hi> the
<hi>Vsbeques,</hi> and other enemies of that Nation. The remainder of the day was merrily spent in
Eating and Drinking, whereof we, who were sent upon the Complement, participated suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
for the <hi>Chan</hi> would needs oblige us to sit down at Table with him. The Festival lasted
till the next day, and then the <hi>Chan</hi> made a great Entertainment for the Ambassadors, whereto
he invited also the Monk I spoke of before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>March</hi> 20. the <hi>Chan</hi> and the <hi>Calenter</hi> came to see the Ambassadors. They were both gotten
sufficiently Drunk, and the occasion of their Visit was this, that the <hi>Chan</hi> being to take a
Journey (as he would make us believe) and not likely to return before our departure thence,
he came to tell us, that he thought it unhandsome to go without taking leave of the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.
He brought along with him his <hi>Hakim,</hi> or Physician, who had also some smattering in
Astrology, as most of that Profession have. His <hi>Hakim</hi> told him, after he had observ'd the
Sky a while, that the Stars signify'd it was an unfortunate hour to go into the Lodgings of the
Ambassadors, and upon that Prediction, they sat down in the Court and fell a-drinking. The
<hi>Chan</hi> having taken notice of one of the Ambassador <hi>Crusius</hi>'s Pages, a beautiful and well-tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Lad, he desir'd him to come near him; which when he had, addressing his speech to the
Physician, he ask'd him, whether he did not think him a fine Boy, and wish'd he had been his
his own Son. The Physician, having taken another view of the Heavens, though the Air were
not very clear, and that it was not near night, made answer, that if, after he had earnestly
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47786:113"/>
view'd the Boy, and by that means Imprinted an Idea of him in his imagination, he went and
lay with a Woman, he would certainly get as handsome a Boy as that was. This the <hi>Chan</hi> and
his Company believ'd as an Oracle; insomuch, that having for some time well considered the
Page, he got on Horse-back and departed.</p>
                     <p>There was at <hi>Schamachie</hi> a <hi>Persian</hi> slave, named <hi>Faruch,</hi> who being a <hi>Muscovite</hi> by Birth,
had been stollen and sold into <hi>Persia,</hi> where he had been circumcis'd, while he was yet very
young. He delighted much to be among us, because there were in our retinue some persons
who could talk with him in his own Language: insomuch that being, by his often coming to
our quarters, grown familiar with some, he came one day to tell us, that we should have a care
of our <hi>Persian</hi> Interpreter,<note place="margin">Our <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter proves a Renegade.</note> whose name was <hi>George Rustan;</hi> for, to his knowledge, he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to some of his Friends at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> to this effect; That, though he had liv'd a long time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>Christians,</hi> yet were they not to inferr thence, that he had abjur'd the <hi>Mahumetane</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
but that he should ere long be with them, to give them further assurances of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
<hi>Rustan</hi> was a <hi>Persian</hi> born, and had, not many years before, travell'd into <hi>England,</hi>
where he had been Baptiz'd. Some years after, he went into <hi>Muscovy,</hi> where we found him,
in the <hi>English</hi> Residents retinue, who was his God-father; and coming to hear that we were
to go into <hi>Persia,</hi> he made so many friends, and was so importunate with the Resident, that
at last, we gave him leave to go along with us as an Interpreter. Yet was he not receiv'd into our
retinue, till he had oblig'd himself by a Writing under his hand, to come back with us, and
by many solemn protestations assured us, that his going along with us was out of no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
than to look after and receive what was due to him of his Patrimony, that he might have
somewhat to Trade withal as a Merchant at his return. Accordingly, we were no sooner come
to <hi>Ardebil,</hi> but we found the truth of what we had been told by <hi>Faruch:</hi> for, <hi>Rustan,</hi> as
soon as he was got to a place, where he might expiate his pretended sin, and declare himself
with safety, he went to the Sepulchre of their great Saint, <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi> where he did his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
as a right <hi>Mahumetane:</hi> which that he had done, he got a formal Certificate. We
secur'd him at <hi>Ispachan,</hi> but he made his escape, and got into the Sanctuary, which they call
<hi>Alla-Capi.</hi> That done, he cast himself at the feet of the King, and the <hi>Seter,</hi> or Chief of their
Sect, express'd his repentance in tears, begg'd Pardon, put himself under the Kings protection,
and remain'd in <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>March</hi> the 22. Father <hi>Ambrosio</hi> took leave of us, being to return to his Monastery
at <hi>Tiflis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>March</hi> 24. the <hi>Chan</hi> sent away the New-years gifts, which the Governours are wont to
send the King at the beginning of the year, and which were at this time so much the greater, by
how much the disgrace and death of his Brother impos'd upon him a necessity of Courting the
Kings favour. The Present consisted in a certain number of excellent Horses, richly Harness'd,
several Camels loaden with <hi>Russia</hi> Leather, several rich Stuffs, and thirty bags full of Swan's
down: but what augmented the value of this rich Present, was a great number of handsome
Boys and Girls, whom he sent along with it. The <hi>Chan</hi> went himself out of the City, with an
intention, as was given out, to conduct the Present two or three leagues: but he returned not,
leaving, by that means, upon the <hi>Calenter,</hi> the trouble of providing all things for the prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Journey. Immediately after the <hi>Chan</hi>'s departure, there was sent to our quarters
the sum of sixty <hi>Tumains,</hi> which amount to about a thousand Crowns, by way of re-emburse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the charges we had been at during our stay at <hi>Schamachie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, in regard it amounted not to one half of what we might expect, according to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
which was assign'd us at our arrival,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors re-embur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their expence.</note> the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> sending us to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter</hi>
about other business, charged us to ask him by the way, whether it were upon any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the King, or out of the Governours kindness towards us, that the said sum had been
sent us, and to let him know, that though it was not the intention of the Ambassadors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any money, yet since the <hi>Calenter</hi> had sent it under his own Seal, they would carry it so
seal'd to <hi>Ispahan:</hi> That they could not forbear complaining of the injury had been done them
in keeping them there so long, contrary to the orders they had received from Court, to take the
speediest course they could for their departure.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Calenter</hi> made answer, that it lay not upon him to maintain the Ambassadors, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them with money: That it was not to him their Master had sent them, but to the King, and
that it was accordingly by his Majesty's appointment, that he had sent the foresaid sum: That
he could not hinder them from making their complaints, but that they should advantage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
nothing thereby: That, for the clearing of himself, he would produce their acquittance
at the Court, and that the <hi>Chan</hi> and himself had supply'd them out of their own, till the Kings
Order was brought them: That he was much troubled at the inconveniences which the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
had been put to, during the long stay they had made in that City, but that it was not their
fault, since it had been impossible, in so short a time, to get Horses and Wagons enough, for so
many people, and so much Baggage, intreating us, ere we went away, to honour him so far as
to Dine with him once more, which we did.</p>

                        <hi>March</hi> the 27. there were brought us sixty Wagons for the Baggage, and for the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of some of the Retinue who were sick, or not able to ride, and a hundred and twenty
Sadle-Nags. We sent away our Steward with all the Baggage that night.</p>
                     <p>But ere we take our leave quite of a place where we had sojourn'd so long,<note place="margin">Scamachie <hi>described<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi>
                        </note> it will not be
amiss to give here a short accompt of the City of <hi>Scamachie.</hi> Father <hi>Bizarrus,</hi> in his <hi>History
of Persia,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph Barbaro,</hi> in his <hi>Travels,</hi> call it sometimes <hi>Summachia,</hi> sometimes <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi>
or <hi>Samachia,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> write it <hi>Xamachi.</hi> Some Geographers place it in their
Maps below <hi>Derbent,</hi> others place it above, and there are also some who put it in twice, for
fear of failing. Its true name, according to the pronunciation of the <hi>Persians,</hi> is <hi>Scamachie,</hi> and
it lies forty <hi>German</hi> Leagues, or six great dayes journey from <hi>Derbent:</hi> it being suppos'd a
man takes the Mountain way, which is very much about. For if a man goa-foot, or on horse-back
along the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, by the City of <hi>Bakuje,</hi> and the Mountain <hi>Lahatz,</hi> where the King
hath a place for the receipt of customs upon forein Commodities, he may easily travel it in two
dayes. The Camels ordinarily take the latter way, and perform their journey in four or five,
and at most in six or seven dayes, according to the burthen they carry. <hi>Scamachie</hi> is the chief
City of that noble Province, which the antients called <hi>Media Atropatia,</hi> or <hi>Media Minor,</hi>
and which is now called <hi>Schiruan;</hi> which is the more to be observ'd, in respect of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
who place this City in <hi>Hyrcania.</hi> It lies at thirty four degrees, forty minutes longitude,
and at forty degrees, fifty minutes latitude, in a valley between two Mountains, which hide it
so, as that it is hardly seen till a man comes to the very Gate. The <hi>Persians</hi> affirm, it was
built by <hi>Schiruan Schach,</hi> and that it was heretofore much larger than it is now, since there
were in it five thousand houses. It was destroy'd by the <hi>Turks</hi> in the time of King <hi>Abas,</hi> who
perceiving the Emperour of the <hi>Turks</hi> took in only the strongest places, thereby to secure his
Conquests, and minded not open places, and considering withall, that so many strong and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd
places were rather a burthen than an advantage to him, and being in the midst of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
were hard to keep, ordered the pulling down of the Walls on the South-side of the City,
where they were strongest. He took the same course with the Cities of <hi>Tauris, Nachtzuan,
Kentza,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This South-part of <hi>Scamachie</hi> makes as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

North-part, which is still compass'd with a strong Wall, by a little plain, which serves for a
common Market-place to both. The <hi>Persians</hi> affirm, that the Grand Seigneur having taken the
City of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> took the stones from all the Sepulchres, and therewith repair'd the Walls
of it. The North-side of the City lies at the foot of a little Mountain, and is somewhat, but
not much bigger than the other, containing but about nine hundred houses. It hath but a poor
Wall about it, which being but low, and having but a wretched Ditch, hinders not but that a man
may come into the City at any time.<note place="margin">Its streets and houses. Its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, their Language, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> The City hath five Gates; its streets are narrow, and the
houses low, and most built of Mortar and Earth. There are very few of Brick, or Free-stone.
The Inhabitants are partly <hi>Armenians,</hi> partly <hi>Georgians:</hi> who have each their particular Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
so as that they would not understand one another, if they did not make use of the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish,</hi>
which is common to both, not only in <hi>Schiruan,</hi> but also all over <hi>Persia.</hi> Their greatest
Commerce lies in Stuffs of Silk and Cotton, whereof there are such quantities made, that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
nay, very Children make a shift to get their living there, by spinning and preparing the
Silk and Cotton for the work-men. Most of their shops are in the South-part of the City,
where there is also a <hi>Basar,</hi> or Market-place, into which abutt many streets, which are all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
for the convenience of the Merchants. Not far from this Market-place, there are two
Store-houses, containing many Chambers and Galleries, for the entertainment of forein Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who sell by whole-sale, and for the disposal of their Merchandises. One is called <hi>Schach
Caravansera,</hi> and is the place appointed for the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who bring thither Tin, <hi>Russia</hi>
Leather, Copper, Furrs, and other Commodities. The other, which is called <hi>Losgi Caravan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sera,</hi>
was built for the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Circassia,</hi> who do not bring their Commodities thither, but
lead them, they being only Horses, Women, young Lads, and handsom Maids, wherewith
they Trade among themselves in their own Countrey, where they steal them upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Muscovy.</hi> The <hi>Iews,</hi> who have also some part of this latter Store-house assign'd them,
upon this accompt, that the <hi>Muscovites</hi> will not admit them into their Company, bring thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from <hi>Tabefferahn,</hi> the best Woollen Tapistry in the whole Countrey, whereof there is
brought into <hi>Europe</hi> but the refuse. Stuffs of Silk and Cotton, nay, Gold and Silver Broca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,
as also Bows, Arrows, and Cymitars, are sold there at a very reasonable rate.</p>
                     <p>In our return from <hi>Persia,</hi> the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Envoy <hi>Alexei Savinouits</hi> woulds needs go into the
Storehouse belonging to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> &amp; being a person of a pleasant humour, he fell a cheapning
of a Boy, about fifteen or sixteen years of age, who was handsom enough, and ask'd the <hi>Tartar</hi>
what price he set him at, who made answer, he should have him for a hundred Crowns. <hi>Alexei,</hi>
who had no mind to buy, proffer'd him two and thirty; but the <hi>Tartar</hi> laugh'd at him, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Boy a clap upon the buttocks, told the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> that that very part of him was
worth more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:47786:114"/>
There are also in the City three <hi>Hamams,</hi> that is, Baths, or publick Stoves, the use where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is as ordinary in <hi>Persia</hi> as <hi>Muscovy.</hi> There are two which are common to both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
but with this distinction, that the women go in only in the day-time, and the men in the
night. The third which they call <hi>Hamam Schach</hi> is only for the men. Hard by this third Bath
there are two great Trees, for which the <hi>Persians</hi> have a great Veneration, as having been
planted by one of their Saints, named <hi>Schich-Marith,</hi> who is interr'd not far thence, in a
<hi>Metzid,</hi> or Church, where there are greater Devotions done than in other <hi>Metzids</hi> about
the City, wherein there are six in all. The Revenue of this Bath is spent in Luminaries, Cloaths,
and other things necessary about the holy Sepulchre.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Chan</hi>'s charge.</note> or Governour of the City of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> hath also the command of the whole
Province, joyntly with the <hi>Calenter,</hi> or King's Lieutenant. The Governour is entrusted with
the Administration of Justice, as also the disposal of things Civil and Military, upon which last
accompt, he is oblig'd to maintain a thousand men, out of the Revenue of his Government, and
to be in a readiness to march, upon the first order he receives to that purpose. The Kings Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
hath the oversight of his Revenue, and disposes of the Crown-Lands, but is not oblig'd
to go to the Wars: on the contrary he is left in the Province, whereof he hath the sole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
during the absence of the other. The <hi>Chan</hi>'s name was <hi>Areb,</hi> and he kept a very noble
Court, though he were a person of very low extraction, son to a Peasant of the Village of <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rab,</hi>
between <hi>Tauris</hi> and <hi>Ardebil:</hi> but the lowness of his extraction was recompens'd in the
great endowments he was Master of. The <hi>Persians</hi> are very indifferent as to a man's birth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he be otherwise a person of courage and worth, and <hi>Areb</hi> had much of both, and had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
so great reputation by his valour, that <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi> made him Controller of his Ordinance,
when he besieg'd <hi>Eruan,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken from the <hi>Persians.</hi> He discharg'd that trust
so well, and in all other things answer'd the opinion the King had conceived of him, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
on him then the Government of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> which became vacant by the death of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruch-Chan,</hi>
who was kill'd in the siege we spoke of before. <hi>Areb</hi> took no small pleasure in
shewing us the wounds he had receiv'd in that War, and in telling us how many <hi>Turks</hi> heads he
had brought to his King, who sent him continually upon parties and forlorns, against the Army,
which was coming to relieve that place.</p>
                     <p>The Governour and his Lieutenant had both very gracefull and bold aspects, and with that
all the requisite qualities in Commanders, save that they were both so addicted to Wine, that
they were seldom met fasting: but the Governour had still this advantage over his Lieutenant,
that he was more apt to be overcome by it than the other.</p>
                     <p>I may boldly and truly say, that, in all this City, I found not the least track of Antiquity.
For, though I took abundance of pains to find out that great Tower, whereof <hi>Iohn Cartwright</hi>
an <hi>English</hi> Gentleman, speaks, in the relation of his <hi>Travels into Persia,</hi> where he sayes it is built
of Flint and Free-stone, and that they have thrust many dead mens skulls between the stones,
yet could not find any such thing, or learn any news of it. 'Tis true, I found two mens heads
cut in the stone, at one certain place of the City-wall, but no body could tell me what they
Represented. It is also true, that, not far from the City, there are to be seen the ruins of a
Castle, which had some time been fortify'd, as the same Author sayes elsewhere. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that there are the remainders of a very strong place within half a League of the City, and
that towards the North-side, upon a very high, and very steepy Mountain, which is called <hi>Kale
Kulestan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I had the curiosity to go up to the top of the said Mountain, and found nothing whole, but a
very noble great Cellar, and near it one of the deepest Wells that ever I saw, both compass'd
with the best free-stone that ever was put in any work. We were told that that Province had
heretofore had its particular Kings, and that <hi>Schiruan Scach</hi> had built that Castle, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of one of his <hi>Chasses,</hi> or Concubines, who gave it the name, and that it was <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great that destroy'd that noble Structure, which none ever after offer'd to repair. I am of
opinion, that the Castle derived its name from the neighbouring Valley, in as much as, having
running through it a Brook, which makes it one of the most delightful places in the World, and
that being in the Spring cover'd with an infinite number of Tulips, which nature her self is
pleas'd to produce there, sit is not to be much admir'd, that they called the place <hi>Kale Kulestan,</hi>
that is, the Fort, or <hi>Castle of Roses,</hi> since the <hi>Persians</hi> give the name of <hi>Kulestan,</hi> or <hi>Valley of
Roses</hi> to all those places, where they would have it express'd, that there is an extraordinary
pleasantness. So that there is no necessity of seeking the Etymology of that name in Fables, or
in things which might have hapned before the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, whereof the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
have had nothing transmitted to them.</p>
                     <p>Near <hi>Kulestan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sepulchres of Saints.</note> between the Fort and the City of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> there are also two Chapels,
upon a Mountain, which is higher than that we spoke of last. In the greater of the two, which is
built in the form of a <hi>Parallelogram,</hi> there is a very high Sepulchre to be seen, and all about it
several pieces of Cloath and Rags of all sorts of colours, with Rods of Iron, whose ends are like
the tops of Arrows, and they are fastned or ty'd to the Sepulchre with a silk string. In the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47786:114"/>
other, there were two Sepulchres, adorn'd much after the same manner with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
These are the Tombs of some of their Saints, near which they often do their
Devotions.</p>
                     <p>From this last Chapel there is a descent into a spacious Vault,<note place="margin">The Tomb of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                        </note> where is to be seen the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre
of one of their Kings Daughters, named <hi>Amelek Kanna,</hi> of whom they relate, that she had
so great an aversion against marriage, that her Father desirous she should match with a <hi>Tartar</hi>-Prince,
she kill'd her self, to prevent it. The same <hi>Cartwright</hi> says, that the young maids of
those parts go once a year to the Sepulchre of this Princess, to bewail her death. It is possible,
that, in his time, some such thing might be done; but let it be taken for certain, that that
custom is now absolutely abolish'd, and that it is not Devotion, but the Heat, which obliges
the Inhabitants, in the height of Summer, to retire to this Mountain, as also to <hi>Kulestan,</hi> for
the greater coolness of the air: and that it is out of such a consideration, that they do their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
near these Saints more frequently in that season, than at any other time of the year.
Trades-men, and persons of mean condition, stay there only in the day time, and at night re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the City; but the <hi>Chan,</hi> the <hi>Calenter,</hi> and persons of quality have their Tents pitch'd
there, and remove not thence during the three hottest Moneths of the year. During which time
they also drive their Cattel towards the Mountain of <hi>Elbours,</hi> where they find not only a more
temperate air, but also as good Meadow-ground as any in all <hi>Persia.</hi> That Mountain is part
of Mount <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and it is of such height, that though it be at a very great distance from
thence, inasmuch as it lies on one side of <hi>Tabristhan,</hi> towards <hi>Georgia,</hi> yet may it be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from <hi>Kale Kulesthan,</hi> and the other neighbouring Mountains of <hi>Scamachie.</hi> It was upon
this Mountain of <hi>Elbours,</hi>

<hi>Iescht,</hi> though <hi>Texeira,</hi> and those who follow him, would have us believe the contrary. True
indeed it is, that there are, to this day, in the <hi>Indies,</hi> certain Religious men, who have a
Veneration for the Fire, and keep it in with the same care that the <hi>Persians</hi> did heretofore; as
we shall take occasion to shew in the subsequent Travels of <hi>Mandelslo</hi> into those parts. But it

the next day, and were upon their way two hours before day. The Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> who
was dis-satisfy'd with the Treatment we had receiv'd at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> would not permit the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter</hi>
should have the honour to conduct us, but gave order we should dislodge and depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any noise, and that all should go, while it was yet Night, afoot out of the Gates, where
we took Horse. Having Travell'd about two Leagues, we found a <hi>Scotch-man</hi> of our retinue,
whose name was <hi>Alexander Chambers,</hi> dead in the Waggon, though, at the Loading of the
Baggage, he seem'd to be so well, as that it was conceiv'd he might have gone through the
Journey, which occasion'd us to make a Halt, to dispose of the Body into the ground. We
buried him at the bottom of a little Hill, cover'd all over with Hyacinths, on the left hand, near
the High-way.</p>
                     <p>Having got half a League further, we came to the Sepulchre of another Saint, named <hi>Pyr
Mardechan,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Fakerlu,</hi> where we were forc'd to take up our Quarters in the
open Air, and without Tents, making a shift in that manner to pass over one of the sharpest
Nights we had in all our Journey, by reason of the Storm, which came attended by Lightning,
Thunder, Wind, Rain, Snow and Frost; the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> being desirous to outvy the
Thonder, with our Artillery, which he caus'd to be several times discharg'd. The next day,
the same Ambassador having observ'd, that several pieces of Canon were left behind, because
there were not Camels enough to bring them away,<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of one of the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors.</note> and that the Horses were too weak to draw

he came to Railing, and Spetting when he nam'd the <hi>Chan</hi> and the <hi>Calenter,</hi> and said that the
<hi>Chan</hi> had not been so good as his Word, and had ly'd in all he said, but that he should resent it,
and that he would either have his Life, or the other should have his.</p>
                     <p>Some were of opinion, that he would stay there till the pieces we had left at <hi>Scamachie</hi> were
brought up: but, upon the Remonstrances of some others, that the place was too incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
that we had nothing over our Heads; that we should want both Wood and Provisions,
and that the sick Persons would not be able to endure the Cold, it was resolv'd we should go
on, which we did, and came, after two Leagues travel to a <hi>Caravansera,</hi> called <hi>Tach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>si,</hi> and
having gone two Leagues further, we were got to the top of the Mountain of <hi>Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the top of the said Mountain there is a fair Plain, and an even and fertile ground,
though in Winter, and at the beginning of the Spring, Rain, Snow and hard Weather are
no strangers there, and bring the same inconveniences along with them, as they do in some parts
of <hi>Europe.</hi> But as soon as we were come to the brow or descent of the Mountain, we saw a
clear Sky, a chearful Sun, and discover'd a Country wholly cover'd with Verdure, in a spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Plain, which reaching above ten Leagues, without any excrescency so much as to the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47786:115"/>
height of two foot, represented to us, as it were in a Map, the Course and Conjunction of
those two Rivers, <hi>Araxes</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which the Writings of Antient Historians and Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
have so highly celebrated. This descent was above half a league, but easie, and not very
steepy; so that those who went fore-most, looking behind them, saw the last of our company
descending as it were out of the Clouds. We took up our Lodging that night in certain <hi>Ottacks,</hi>
or Huts, which the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Shepherds had set up there near their Flocks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 30. we got four leagues, along the Plain, as far as the Village of <hi>Kasilu.</hi> We met, in
our way,<note place="margin">Nomades.</note> with a company of Sheep-herds and Cow-herds, who march'd with their Houses and
all their Houshold-stuff, their Wives and Children, all as it were shuffled together in Wagons,
or pack'd up upon Horses, Cows, Asses, and other Creatures, not ordinarily us'd in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
after a very odd manner, and such as represented a very Fantastick kind of Transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Ever after that day, we had nothing but fair weather, a Sky clear, and without any cloudiness,
save that when we travell'd over the Mountains, we might, in the Morning, see the Heavens a
little over-cast; but as soon as the Sun appear'd, all was dispell'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>March</hi> the last, we travell'd two leagues, along the River side, to a Village named <hi>Tzauat,</hi>
upon the right side of the <hi>Kur,</hi> or the River, which the Antients called <hi>Cyrus,</hi> all the Houses
whereof were built of Reeds and Canes,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Aras.</hi>
                        </note> and cover'd with Earth. About a quarter of a league
above this Village, is the Conflux, or meeting of this River with that of <hi>Araxes,</hi> which is
now called <hi>Aras,</hi> at thirty nine degrees, fifty four minutes Elevation; the <hi>Cyrus</hi> coming from
West-north-west, and the <hi>Aras</hi> from South-west. These Rivers after they are met together are
about four hundred paces in breadth. Their water is black and deep, and the brink on both sides
pretty high. All along the River side, and all the Meadow grounds of the Province of <hi>Mokan,</hi>
were cover'd with Liquorice, the stalk whereof is many times as big as a man's arm, and the
juyce, beyond all comparison, sweeter and more pleasant than that of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The River <hi>Kur</hi> serves for a common Frontier to the two Provinces of <hi>Schiruan</hi> and <hi>Mokan,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">APRIL.</note> and
found, on the other side of the River, another <hi>Mehemandar,</hi> whom the <hi>Chan</hi> or Governour of
<hi>Ardebil</hi> had sent to meet us, and to conduct us in the pursuance of our Journey, as far as the
chief City of his Government. He had brought along with him, for the carriage of us and the
Baggage, forty Camels, and three hundred Horses: in regard, the way we were then to come
into being very bad, by reason of the continued Mountains and Valleys, we could not have made
any use of our Waggons. He supply'd us with Provisions in abundance, allowing us, every
day, ten Sheep, thirty <hi>Batmans</hi> of Wine, and Rice, Butter Eggs, Almonds, Raisins, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and all sorts of Fruits as much as we pleas'd. On Sunday, after Sermon, we departed,
taking our way along the River <hi>Aras,</hi> for above a League. We lodg'd that night within half a
League of the River, at the entrance of a great Heath in Hutts, which the <hi>Mehemandar</hi> had
purposely ordered to be provided, for our convenience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>April</hi> the third, we pass'd over the Heath, which reaches about four <hi>Farsangs,</hi> or <hi>Persian</hi>
Leagues,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ahu,</hi> a kind of Deer.</note> and we were lodg'd again that night in Hutts, as we had been the night before. We
had seen all that day in great Herds, a kind of Deer, which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Tzeiran,</hi> and the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,
Ahu,</hi> which have some resemblance to our Harts, save that they are rather Red than
Fawn, and their Horns have no Brow-anclers, but are smooth, and lye backward like those of
wild Goats. They are very swift, and there are not any of that kind, as we were told,
but what are in the Province of <hi>Mokan,</hi> and about <hi>Schamachie, Karrabach,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>April</hi> 4. we were forc'd to leave the way of the Heath, though much the nearer, and to take
another, which brought us, by a great compass of above six Leagues, to a Torrent called <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haru,</hi>
out of this consideration, that if we had travell'd along the Heath, we should have want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
water,<note place="margin">Tortoises.</note> both for our selves and our Horses. We found in that place abundance of Tortoises,
which had made their Nests along the side of the Torrent, and in the Sand of the little Hills
thereabouts, but all expos'd to the Mid-day Sun, so to give the greater heat to their Eggs, which
cannot be hatch'd but in the Hot,<note place="margin">The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</note> or rather burning Sand. Perceiving some men on the other
side of the Torrent, some of our people had the curiosity to cross it, to observe their manner of
Life: Their Children were stark Naked, and Aged persons had nothing about them but a shirt
or smock of Cotton. The poor people entertain'd us very kindly, and brought us some Milk.
They thought that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> had sent for us, to serve him in his Wars against the <hi>Turk,</hi>
out of which perswasion, they pray'd for our good success, that God would make their and our
Enemy fly before us, as far as <hi>Stamp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>April</hi> the 5. we overcame the Heath of <hi>Mokan,</hi> and came to the Mountain and Country of
<hi>Betzirwan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Betzirwan</note> after we had twelve several times cross'd one little River, which lay so many times
in our way. We got that day five leagues, and lodg'd at night in a Village called <hi>Schechm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Most of the Houses were built at the foot of the Mountain, and some within the Mountain, and
were cover'd with Reeds: but we found not any Body in the Village, for those who went along

they pass'd that way, that we were a sort of Barbarous people, who thought it not enough to
take and ransack all, but did also abuse and beat such as entertain'd us: upon which accompt of
us, they were all gone to hide themselves in the Rocks of the neighbouring Mountain. There
were some of our company, who got up a very high Mountain to see what Simples they could
find there, and to take a view of the adjacent Country: but they found not any there, and the
other nearer Mountains, which were higher than that we were upon, absolutely deprived us of
the sight of the Champain.</p>
                     <p>They met not with any thing remarkable there, save that upon the very top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
there was a pleasant Spring, near which we saw coming out of the clefts of the Rock a
kind of Crabb, which some among us, who had never seen any before, took for some venemous
Creature. The Author is of opinion, that it is a Sea-fish; but he is mistaken, for it is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no other animal than that which in <hi>Latin</hi> is called <hi>Cancer,</hi> is found in Rivers, and is of a
different species from the common Sea-crabb, which is called <hi>Acastus.</hi> We sate down by the
Spring-side, and, in what Liquor nature had furnish'd the place with, drunk to our Friends in
<hi>Germany.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>April</hi> 6. We could not possibly get above two Leagues, over Mountains and Rocks, where
we saw a great number of Fig-trees, which the Earth produc'd there without any Cultivation.
We came at night to a ruin'd Village, called <hi>Tisle;</hi> but ere we had quite taken up our Quarters
and unloaded the Baggage, word was brought us, that it was the Plague, which, the Autumn
before, had consumed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Ambassadors caus'd a Tent to be pitch'd in the fields, but all the rest of the retinue had, at first,
no other covering over their Heads than the Sky, till the <hi>Mehemandar</hi> had sent for some <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi>
Huts,<note place="margin">Tartarian <hi>Hutts.</hi>
                        </note> which were brought late in the night loaded upon Oxen. These kind of Huts are
made of several pieces of Wood, which are fasten'd together at the ends, so as they may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a-sunder, or set together in a short time. The Sieur <hi>Vchterits,</hi> who had stay'd a while in
the Village, to see the Baggage loaden and convey'd thence, coming to the Ambassadors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tent,
was so rail'd at by the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> who reproach'd him that he came from an Infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
House, to bring the Plague among them, that he fell into a Feaver.</p>
                     <p>There were some in the Company, who finding the weather somewhat close and cold, went
and lock'd themselves up in a house, where they made a good fire, and spent the time merrily
with the Wine they had kept the day before, diverting themselves, and singing to drive away
Melancholy, and to forget the froward humour of the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> which they were
as much afraid of as the unwholsome air. The <hi>Indians</hi> had begun the building of a <hi>Caravansera</hi>
in that place, for the convenience of Commerce, which was grown to a considerable height;
but the Plague had hindred them from finishing it.</p>
                     <p>The 7.<note place="margin">Ill weather,</note> we had a very sad dayes journey of it, being forc'd, in a continual trot, to travel above

where we found excellent Gardens, and abundance of fruit-trees, but no Wood for firing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that we were forc'd to make use of Cow-dung, Hors-dung, and Camels-dung. We
sent away that day our Forrager, to take up Quarters for us at <hi>Ardebil.</hi>

                     <p>The 8. having broke our fast, we got on Hors-back, and after we had travell'd three leagues

<hi>Thabedar,</hi> two little leagues from <hi>Ardebil,</hi> where we stay'd that night. The next day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

we saw how the Inhabitants dawb the VValls of their Houses with Dung, that
the Sun may the sooner dry it, and make it combustible: but we were also in this place terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
persecuted with Fleas and Lice, and other nasty Vermine, wherewith we were in a manner
cover'd.</p>
                     <p>The 9. we Celebrated our Easter, beginning the Festival with the firing of our great Guns,
and small shot, which we ordered to be discharged thrice. That done, we had a Sermon, and
did our Devotions.</p>
                     <p>About noon we were visited by our new <hi>Mehemandar,</hi> whose name was <hi>Netzefbce;</hi> he

was a person of an excellent good humour. He came to Complement us upon occasion of the

Apples, and a sort of Pears I had never seen before, fashion'd like a Citron, and full of

he rode in between them. Before our Troop, there march'd two youths clad in Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins
of several colours, upon their clean skirts, and carrying each of them upon the top of a
long and very slender pole, an Orenge. The poles, we were told, were made of a
Date-tree.</p>
                     <p>These youths read and sung, out of a Book, certain Verses made in honour of <hi>Mahomet,
Aly,</hi> and <hi>Schach Sefi.</hi> They were Sons or Disciples to a certain <hi>Abdalla,</hi> of whom we shall
speak hereafter. After them came others, who were cloathed in white, and had a wonderful
Art in imitating the Notes and singing of Nightingales and other birds. On both sides march'd
the Timbrels and Hawboies; in some places there were people dancing and singing at the same
time, and at others were some dancing after another manner. Some cast their caps up into the
air, and caught them again with cries and exclamations of joy. There were some danc'd with
little Garlands about their heads, much like those we had seen at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> when they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
there, the death of <hi>Aly.</hi> Near the City stood the Guards, in two files, having their
Bows and Arrows in their hands, Coats of Mail about their bodies, and their heads cover'd
with little Caps like Calottes, which they call <hi>Aratskin,</hi> in which they had plac'd abundance
of Feathers, the ends whereof, some thrust through their Caps, into the skin. Many of them
were naked down to the waste, and though they had the flesh of their Arms and Breasts pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with Daggers or Ponyards, yet did they not seem sensible of any pain thereat; whence we
inferr'd there might be something of Charm in it, and that they were Sorcerers, there being
abundance that deserve that name in <hi>Persia.</hi> There was also a Company of <hi>Indians,</hi> who as we
pass'd by, saluted us, after their way, with a low inclination of the head, putting their hands
to their breasts. When we were come somewhat near the City, there was so great a conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of people, that we could not get a hundred paces forward without making a halt; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they were forc'd to drive them away with Cudgels and Bulls-pizzels, so to make
them give way. And within the City, all the Windows, Houses-tops, Steeples, and Trees, were
full of those, who came from all parts to see our passage through it.</p>
                     <p>The Governour brought us, through a spacious Garden, into a fair Summer-house, to which
there were ten stairs to get up,<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour gives them a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> and treated us with a sumptuous Collation, in a very stately
Gallery; honouring all those who came up with the Ambassadors so far as to present, to every
one of them with his own hands, a Vessel full of Wine, while all the rest of the Retinue were
treated below, in a Tent, which had been purposely pitch'd there to that end. The Collation
was accompany'd with the best Musick the Country could afford, as also with a Dance perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by their <hi>Ochtzi,</hi> or Archers, who dancing, in cadence, with their Bows in their hands,
represented a kind of Ball, which their exactness of the observance of time made more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
&amp; divertive, than had been the singing of those two youths, the sons of <hi>Abdalla,</hi> who with
their Orenges in their hands, very seriously celebrated the praises of their Prophet. After the
Collation and Divertisement, the Ambassadors were conducted to very spacious Lodgings,
which had been taken up for them in one of the noblest parts of the City, which Lodgings had
sometime belong'd to <hi>Sara Chutza,</hi> high Chancellor of <hi>Persia.</hi> The rest of the Retinue were
Lodg'd not far from them, in the neighbourhood, where they were well accommodated, by those
into whose houses they were receiv'd.</p>
                     <p>This Summer-house, being one of the noblest Structures I ever saw, deserves I should give in
this place a more particular description of it.<note place="margin">The <hi>Chan's</hi> House de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> 
                        <hi>Sulfagar Chan,</hi> the Predecessor of <hi>Kelbele Chan,</hi>
in the Government of <hi>Ardebil,</hi> a Person of infinite wealth, had built it, according to a modell
he had brought out of <hi>Turkey.</hi> The figure of it was Octagonal, and it was three Stories, so
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47786:116"/>
rais'd, that Art had not left any thing to be desir'd. Every story had its Fountains, which
cast their water higher than any part of the House. The Walls were built of a sort of Glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stones, of all Colours, Blew, Green, Red, and of all sorts of Figures, and all the Floors
were cover'd with the richest Tapistry the Country could afford. All about the House there
was a spacious Gallery, all built with Marble, and adorn'd with Painting, representing Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Leaves. At one of the corners of that Gallery, there was a little Couch or Chair of
State, four foot square, cover'd with Embroider'd Tapistry, having in the midst a Quilt
wrought with Gold and Silk,<note place="margin">The vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the <hi>Persians</hi> have for their Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> to signifie, that the King, passing one day through <hi>Ardebil,</hi> had
rested himself there; which made the place so Venerable, that, to the end none should come
near it, it was encompass'd with an Iron rail. The said <hi>Sulfagar Chan</hi> had built also another
House of Pleasure or Summer-house, in a great Garden, near a stone-Bridge, without the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but at the time of our Travels that way, it lay desolate, as indeed it had been ever since
the Death of <hi>Sulfagar,</hi> who had been Executed, upon the instigation of <hi>Kartzogar,</hi> General
of the <hi>Persian</hi> Army. The other House, which was within the City, had been bestow'd by the
King upon <hi>Kelbele Chan,</hi> to be enjoy'd by him during his Life.</p>

                        </note> which was <hi>April</hi> 11. there was brought the Ambassadors
from <hi>Schich-Sefi</hi>'s Kitchin, the <hi>Thaberick;</hi> which is a certain quantity of Meat, sent in for three
meals, to such great Lords, and other Persons of quality, as come into that City, according
to a pious Institution, which hath been observ'd about the Body of <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi> Author and
Founder of the Religion of the <hi>Persians,</hi> as also near that of the late King, whose Sepulchres
are at <hi>Ardebil.</hi> Our <hi>Thaberick</hi> was brought us in 32 great Dishes or Basins full of Rice, of all
sorts of Colours, upon which the Meat was laid, which consisted of Boyl'd, Roast, Omelets,
and Pastry, according to their way of Dressing. Those who were appointed to bring us this
Dinner, carry'd the Dishes upon their Heads, and set them down upon a Cloath, which was
laid upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>We were not over-pleas'd with this Entertainment, by reason, not only of the trouble it was
to us to sit down according to the <hi>Persian</hi> way,<note place="margin">Is serv'd without Wine.</note> but also because we were forbidden to drink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Wine at this Feast of the <hi>Thaberick.</hi> However, we ordered our great Guns to be discharg'd
at it, as also our Trumpets to sound, and would have made a small Present to those who had
brought it; but they desir'd to be excus'd, telling us, that the Devotion of the place permitted
them not to receive any Presents.</p>
                     <p>The next day, there was such order taken for the Provisions of the Kitchin, that we had all
the reason in the world to be satisfy'd therewith. We were allow'd every day sixteen Sheep,

of God: for so they understand the History of the Sacrifice of <hi>Abraham.</hi> All their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
consists in killing, before day, a Sheep, or Lamb, in the street, at their own Doors, which
being cut into pieces, they distribute them among the poor, who come to those Doals
in great numbers. They do not reserve so much as the skin; which they do, as they affirm, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                        </note> that the <hi>Persians</hi> go to do their Devotions at <hi>Meca,</hi> as well as the
<hi>Turks.</hi> They say that <hi>Noah,</hi> when he went into the Ark, took along with him seventy two
Persons, and for that reason, it is requisite the Pilgrims of <hi>Meca</hi> should amount to the number
of seventy two thousand; and that number ought to be so exactly observ'd, that if there be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more or less, they must not be receiv'd there, as such, that year. But above all things, it
is their main care, that that great number be compleat; for otherwise, as they affirm, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
would be oblig'd to come in, to make up what were wanting, and it were a wont of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to those Spirits to put them to that trouble. The men put on a particular Coiffure for
this Voyage, which is a kind of Turbant of white Wool; in regard their Law forbids them to
wear it of any Colour, or of silk at that time. They call this kind of Turbant <hi>Ehharan,</hi> and
they cover their Heads therewith, only as they go; so as that one part of it falling down on one
side of the Head, passes under the Chin, and is fasten'd on the other side.</p>
                     <p>They commonly take their way through the City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Pilgrimage to <hi>Meca.</hi>
                        </note> where they do their first
Devotions. Thence they pass through <hi>Medina,</hi> where they continue them, at the Sepulchre
of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which they kiss with a profound Veneration, and then they conclude them at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
or Mount <hi>Arafat.</hi> From <hi>Medina</hi> to <hi>Meca,</hi> they are cover'd only with a shirt, nay
some go naked down to the waste. In this posture, they march continually, and after a very
particular fashion. For they are oblig'd to go, after the rate of a trotting Horse, or rather that
of a Camel galloping; and that with such earnestness, that they hardly take the leisure to eat
and drink, or yet to sleep: and all, out of an imagination, that the Sweat caus'd by that Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Motion, and forc'd out of their Bodies, carries away with it all their Sins, and cleanseth
them of all their filthiness. The Women, who might not be able to bear the inconveniences of
such a march, have the privilege to swath up their Breasts with a Skarf, which hath a particular
name, and they call it <hi>Scamachtze.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The tenth day of the moneth of <hi>Silhatza,</hi> is that of their great Devotion. That day, all the
Pilgrims go to Mount <hi>Arafat,</hi> which, they say, is the place where the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi>
should have Sacrifiz'd his Son, and there they spend the whole night in Prayers. Towards the
dawning of the day, they come down, and go to the City of <hi>Meca,</hi> where their <hi>Hetzas,</hi> or
High-Priest, makes a Procession, conducting through the chief streets a Camel, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the Sacrifice. The Hair of this Camel is a very precious Relick among them;
whence it comes, that the Pilgrims throng, to get as near as they can to the Beast, and to
snatch off some of his Hair, which they fasten to their arms, as a very sacred thing. The <hi>Hetzas,</hi>
after he hath walk'd the Beast sufficiently leads him to the <hi>Meydan,</hi> that is, the great Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
and puts him into the hands of the Baily, or Judge of the City, whom they call <hi>Daroga,</hi>
who, attended by some other Officers, kills him with an Axe, giving him many blows in the
Head, Neck, and Breast.</p>
                     <p>As soon as the Camel is dead, all the Pilgrims endeavour to get a piece of him, and throng
with such earnestness and so confusedly, with Knives in their hands, that these Devotions are
never concluded, but there are many Pilgrims kill'd and hurt, who are afterwards allow'd a
place in their Martyrologies. After all these Ceremonies, they go in Procession about the
<hi>Mosquey,</hi> they kiss a Stone, which was left after the finishing of the Structure, and they take
of the Water, which passes through a Golden Chanel over the <hi>Mosquey,</hi> and carry it away as a
Relick, with a little piece of a certain Blackish Wood, of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ooth-picks are commonly
made. When the Pilgrims are return'd from their Pilgrimage they are called <hi>Hatzi,</hi> and they
are as it were <hi>Nazarites,</hi> dedicated to God, in as much as it is unlawful for them to drink Wine
ever after.</p>
                     <p>From this Pilgrimage, and the Sacrifice perform'd at <hi>Meca,</hi> we shall take occasion to insert
here, what the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> relate of that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath dress'd up the
story, falsifying the truth of it in all its circumstances. They say in the first place, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was the son of <hi>Azar,</hi> who was Graver to <hi>Nimroth,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that he married
<hi>Sara,</hi> who was so beautifull a Woman, that the King having cast his eye on her, <hi>Abraham</hi>
grew jealous, and carried her away into <hi>Arabia;</hi> but finding that she bore no Children, he
there bought a Slave, named <hi>Hagar,</hi> whom he carnally knew, and, by her, had <hi>Ismael. Hagar</hi>
being near her time, and not able any longer to endure the ill treatment she receiv'd from <hi>Sara,</hi>
resolv'd to run away. <hi>Abraham</hi> coming to hear of her discontent, and fearing she might make
away the Child, especially if she came to be deliver'd without the assistance of some other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
follow'd her, and found her already deliver'd of a Son, who, dancing with his little feet
upon the ground, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ade way for a Spring to break forth. But the water of the Spring came
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47786:117"/>
forth in such abundance, as also with such violence, that <hi>Hagar</hi> could make no use of it to
quench her thirst, which was then very great. <hi>Abraham</hi> coming to the place, commanded the
Spring to glide more gently, and to suffer that water might be drawn out of it to drink, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thereupon stay'd the course of it with a little Bank of Sand, he took of it, to make <hi>Hagar</hi>
and her child drink. The said Spring is, to this day, called <hi>Semsem,</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s making
use of that word to stay it. After this <hi>Sara</hi> pray'd to God with such earnestness, that he gave
her her son <hi>Isaac.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some time after <hi>Ismael's</hi> birth, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> appear'd to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and told him, that
God commanded him to build a house upon the River, which <hi>Ismael</hi> had given the rise to: in
answer whereto, <hi>Abraham</hi> representing, that it was impossible for him to build any great
structure in the midst of a Desart, where there was nothing but Sand; the Angel reply'd, that
he should not be troubled at that, and that God would provide. Accordingly, <hi>Abraham</hi> was
no sooner come to the place appointed him by the Angel, but Mount <hi>Arafat</hi> forc'd out of its
quarries a great number of stones, which roll'd down from the top of the Mountain, to the side
of the little River, where he built a house, which hath since been converted to a <hi>Mosquey,</hi> and
is the same where the Pilgrims of <hi>Meca</hi> do their Devotions. The Structure being finish'd, there
happened to be one single stone remaining, which began to speak, and to complain that it had
been so unfortunate, as not to be employ'd in that Edifice. But <hi>Abraham</hi> told it, that it should
so much the rather be comforted, in as much as it should one day be in greater Veneration than
all the rest put together, and that all the faithfull who came to that place should kiss it. This is
the stone we spoke of before. These people say, it was heretofore all white, and that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of its being now black, is, that it hath been constantly kiss'd through so many ages.</p>
                     <p>Some years after, the same Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> appeared again to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was grown a
very rich and powerful man, and told him, that God intended to make the highest tryal that
could be of his affection and gratitude, and that he would have him, in acknowledgement of so
many favours, to sacrifize his son to him. <hi>Abraham</hi> immediately consented, and being return'd
home, bid <hi>Hagar</hi> call up her son, and put on his best Cloaths, that he might be the better look'd
on at the Wedding, to which he intended to carry him. They departed the next day betimes
in the morning, and took their way towards Mount <hi>Arafat, Abraham</hi> carrying along with
him a good sharp knife, and some Cords. But as soon as they were gone, <hi>Sceithan,</hi> that is to
say, the Devil, represented himself to <hi>Hagar,</hi> in the shape of a man, reporach'd her with the
easiness, wherewith she had consented, that her son <hi>Ismael</hi> should go from her, and told her,
that what <hi>Abraham</hi> had related to her concerning the Wedding, to which he was to bring him,
was pure forgery, and that he was carrying him streight to the Shambles. <hi>Hagar</hi> ask'd him
why <hi>Abraham</hi> would use her so, since he had alwayes express'd a great tenderness to her son.
The Devil made answer, that God had commanded it should be so; whereto <hi>Hagar</hi> reply'd,
that since it was God's good pleasure to make that disposal of him, it was but fit she should
comply therewith. Whereupon the Devil pressing harder upon her, and treating her as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Mother, endeavouring by those aggravations to bring her into rebellion against God, she
pelted him away with stones. The Devil's endeavour proving unsuccessfull that way, and too
weak to overcome the obstinacy of a woman, he apply'd himself to <hi>Abraham,</hi> reviv'd in him
the tendernesses and affection of a Father, represented to him the horrour of the murther he was
going to commit, and remonstrated to him the little likelyhood there was, that God should be
the Author of so barbarous and abominable an action. But <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was acquainted with
the subtilty and artifices of that wicked spirit, sent him away, and to be the sooner rid of him,
cast also a stone at him. The last attempt the Devil had to make, was, to represent to <hi>Ismael</hi>
the horrour of death, and the unnatural procedure of his Father: but he found the same treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from him, as he had from the other two, and had a good stone flung at his head. The
Father and Son being come to the top of the Mountain, <hi>Abraham</hi> said to his Son <hi>Ismael;</hi> My
Son, I cannot imagine thou knowest the occasion of our journey, and the reason why I have
brought thee to this place. It is only this, that God hath commanded me to sacrifize thee:
whereto <hi>Ismael</hi> made answer, that since it was God's pleasure it should be so, his will be done,
only let me entreat thee, Father, to grant me three things. The first is, that thou have a care to
bind me so fast, that the pains of death may not engage me to attempt any thing against thee.
The second is, that thou whet thy knife very well, and, after thou hast thrust it into my throat,
that thou hold it very fast, and shut thy eyes, out of a fear the cruelty of the action dishearten
thee from going through with it, and so leave me to languish a long time. And the third, that,
when thou art returned home, thou remember my duty to my Mother.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham,</hi> having promis'd to observe all these things, and whetted his knife, binds his son,
directs the knife to his Throat, and, shutting his eyes, holds it as fast as he could: but finding,
when he opened his eyes again, that the knife had made no entrance, he is extremely troubled,
and tries the edge of it upon a stone, which he cuts in two. He was so astonish'd thereat, that
he address'd himself to the Knife, and asked it, why, having so good an edge as to cut a stone,
it could not as well cut his Sons Throat. The knife made answer, that God would not have it
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47786:118"/>
so. Whereupon the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> took <hi>Abraham</hi> by the hand, and said to him; Hold a little,
God would only make tryal of thy faith, Unbind thy Son, and sacrifize this Hee-Goat; and
immediately there came into the place a Hee-Goat, which <hi>Abraham</hi> offered to God, for a
burnt-offering.</p>
                     <p>They affirm, that the three stones, which <hi>Hagar, Abraham</hi> and <hi>Ishmael</hi> cast at the Devil, are
yet to be seen, near the High-way, between <hi>Medina</hi> and <hi>Meca,</hi> and that there are made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
two great heaps of stones, by the means of the Pilgrims, who bring every one three stones,
to be cast at the Devil, at the same place where these heaps are, to the end he may not distract
them in their Devotions.</p>
                     <p>We saw also the same day above five hundred Women,<note place="margin">Prayers for the dead.</note> who were going before day to the
Church-yard to weep over the Graves of their Husbands, and others of their kinred. There
were some who had somewhat to eat at the same time; others had some passages of the
<hi>Alchoran</hi> read to them; and those of any quality had Tents pitch'd there, for their reception,
that they might not be expos'd to the sight of all that pass'd by.</p>
                     <p>This kind of Devotion for the Dead is commonly performed in the time of their <hi>Orut,</hi> or
<hi>Lent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ambassadors were again that day treated out of <hi>Schich-Sefi</hi>'s Kitchin. The meat was
brought in, in six great Copper Vessels tinn'd over, which they call <hi>Lenkeri,</hi> and the Conserves,
in nine great Vessels of Porcelain.</p>

the most eminent Ministers of his Courr. The <hi>Persians</hi> express'd their joy thereat, by the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
which the Governour order'd to be made, as also by the Musick, which ecchoed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the City. The Ambassadors did the like on their part, with their great Guns, causing them
to be fired six times over, and ordering the Trumpets to sound, and the Drums to beat, while
from the roof of their Lodgings they could see all the fires about the City.</p>
                     <p>The Governour was so well pleas'd to see that the Ambassadors concern'd themselves so much
in the publick joy, that he sent them two flaggons of <hi>Schiras</hi> Wine, with a Glass-Vessel, full of
Sugar-candy'd.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>May</hi> 14. the <hi>Persians</hi> began to Celebrate a mournful Festival,<note place="margin">A particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Festival of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>
                        </note> which they call <hi>Aschur,</hi>
which signifies <hi>ten,</hi> in regard it lasts ten days, and begins with the Moon of the moneth <hi>Mahe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</hi>
Of all the sorts and Sects of <hi>Mabumetans,</hi> the <hi>Persians</hi> only Celebrate this Feast, in
memory of <hi>Hossein,</hi> the youngest son of <hi>Haly,</hi> whom they accompt one of their greatest Saints.
The Legends relate of him, that he was kill'd in the War he was engag'd in, against the <hi>Calif
Iesied. He</hi> was at first (according to their story of him) troubled with an extraordinary thirst,
in regard they had depriv'd him of all water. Afterwards, he had seventy two wounds, which
he receiv'd by Arrows, and at last, <hi>Senan ben anessi</hi> run him through the body with a sword, and
<hi>Schemr Sultzausen</hi> kill'd him out-right. That this Feast lasts ten dayes, proceeds hence; that
<hi>Hossein</hi> having left <hi>Medina</hi> to go to <hi>Kufa,</hi> was, for ten days together, pursu'd by his Enemies,
who treated him as we related before. During all that time, the <hi>Persians</hi> go in mourning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
much affliction, suffer not the Rasour to come near their heads, though, at other times
they make use of it every day, live very soberly, drink no Wine, and content themselves with
Water. The whole City of <hi>Ardebil</hi> was taken up in these Ceremonies and extravagant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.
In the day time, the Children and young Lads assembled themselves in great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
up and down the streets, carrying in their hands great Banners, at the extremities whereof
there were Snakes of Pastboard winding to and fro, much like <hi>Mercury's</hi> Caduceus. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
call them <hi>Eschder.</hi> They went to the Doors of their <hi>Metzits,</hi> or <hi>Mosqueys,</hi> and cry'd one
after another <hi>ja Hossein, ja Hossein,</hi> that is, <hi>O Hossein.</hi> In the evening, especially the three last
days of the Festival, after Sun-set, men did also meet in several places, under Tents, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Torches and Lanthorns,<note place="margin">A strange kind of Devotion.</note> having at the tops of their Poles Orenges, as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Abdalla,</hi> singing, and crying out as loud as they were able, their <hi>ja Hossein,</hi> and that
with such violence, that it chang'd the colour of their countenances. Having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> thus about
an hour, they return'd to the City, and went in Procession with their Banners and Torches,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47786:118"/>
through the principal streets. The tenth day concluded the Devotions of the Festival. In the
morning there was an Oration made in honour of <hi>Hossein,</hi> with the same Ceremonies in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as we had seen at the Festival of <hi>Aly</hi> at <hi>Scamachie.</hi> These Ceremonies were performed
in the Court of the <hi>Mesar</hi> of <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi> where, near the Chancery, they had planted a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which, as it is reported, was made by the daughter of <hi>Fatima,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
who caus'd the Iron-work of it to be made of a hors-shooe, which had belong'd to one of the
horses of <hi>Abas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A false miracle.</note> Uncle to <hi>Mahomet</hi> by the Father side, which <hi>Schich Sedredin,</hi> the son of
<hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi> had brought from <hi>Medina</hi> to <hi>Ardebil.</hi> They say, that this Banner shakes of it
self, as often as they pronounce the name of <hi>Hossein,</hi> during the Sermon which is made in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of him, and that when the Priest makes a recital of the particulars of his death, how he
was wounded with seventy two Arrows,, and how he fell down from his horse, it may be seen
shaken by a secret agitation, but withall so violent, that, the staff breaking, it falls to the
ground. I must confess, I saw no such thing, but the <hi>Persians</hi> affirm it so positively, that they
think it should not be any way doubted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>May</hi> 24. about noon, the Governour sent the Ambassadors notice, that they concluded the
Festival that night, and that if they would be present at the Ceremonies which were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
they should be very welcome, and he would take it for a great honour done him: but
it must be with this condition, that, complying with the Law of the <hi>Mussulmans,</hi> they were
not to expect any Wine at the Collation he intended to treat them withall.</p>
                     <p>In the cloze of the evening,<note place="margin">The last Ceremonie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival.</note> the Ambassadors went to the Governour's Palace, who met
them at the street door. And whereas the Ceremony was to be done in the Court, they were
intreated to take their places on the left hand, where they had prepared Seats, cover'd with
Tapistry, for them, and their Retinue, who would have been much troubled, to sit as the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
do. There were set before them, upon a Cloath, wherewith they had cover'd the ground,
several Vessels of Porcelain, with Suger'd and Perfum'd waters, and, near the Table, brass
Candlesticks, four foot high, with great Wax Candles in them, as also Lamps, fill'd with rags
dipt in Suet and Naphte. The Governour took up his place at the entrance of the Court, on the
right side of the Gate, and fate upon the ground. Our people had standing before them great
Wooden Candlesticks, or Branches, holding each of them twenty or thirty Wax-Candles.
There were fasten'd to the Walls thousands of Lamps, of Plaister, all fill'd with Suet and Naphte,
which cast so great a light, that the house seem'd to be all on fire. They had drawn cross the
Court certain Cords whereat hung Paper-Lanthorns, which gave not so full, but, without
comparison, a more pleasant light, than that of the Lamps and Cresset-lights. The Inhabitants
of <hi>Ardebil</hi> are distinguish'd into five quarters, or professions, who meet each by it self, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
some of their Poets,<note place="margin">Persian Poets.</note> whereof there are a very great number in <hi>Persia,</hi> to write them some
Verses, in commendation of <hi>Aly</hi> and <hi>Hossein,</hi> and making choice of those among them who
sing best, they go and give the Governour a Serenade, who receives kindly, and bestows
a Present of water sweetned with Sugar, on that band, which is most excellent, either as touts
invention or Musick.</p>
                     <p>These Musicians being come into the Court drew up in five bands, in so many several places,
and presented themselves one after another before the Governour; but, for the space of two
hours, they may be rather said to cry out and roar, than to sing: after which they all came by
order from the Governour, to make a Complement to the Ambassadors, and wish'd them a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
journey, and good success in their Negotiation at the Court.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, there were dancing at one place in the Court seven youths; all naked, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
only those parts which modesty would not have seen by all. They called that kind of
people <hi>Tzatzaku,</hi> and their bodies, from head to foot, were rubb'd over with Suet and
Naphte, insomuch that their black skins being more shining than jet, they might very well be
compar'd to so many little Devils. They had in their hands little stones, which they knock'd
one against the other, and sometimes they smote their breast with them, to express their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for the death of <hi>Hossein.</hi> These <hi>Tzatzaku</hi> are poor boys, who disguise themselves in that
manner, to get some small matter by it, which is, that they are permitted, during the time of
the Feast, to beg Alms for <hi>Hossain</hi>'s sake. At night, they do not lodge at their Homes, but ly in
the ashes which are brought out of <hi>Schich-Sefi</hi>'s Kitchin. Some, instead of Suet, rub themselves
with Vermilion, that they may make a more lively representation of the blood of <hi>Hossein:</hi> but,
at this time, there were not any such. After these Ceremonies, the Governout entertain'd the
Ambassadors with noble fire-works; which most of the <hi>Persians</hi> took very ill at his hands, and
thought it not over religiously done of him, to give such Divertisements to the <hi>Christians</hi> during
the time of their <hi>Aschur,</hi> which ought to represent only things conducing to sadness and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
                     <p>These fire-works consisted of several very excellent and ingenious inventions,<note place="margin">Fire-work.</note> as of little Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
Towers, Squibs, Crackers, &amp;c. The Castle, to which they first set fire, was three foot
square, the Walls of Paper, of all sorts of Colours. They lighted first several small Wax-Candles
about the moat of it, which discover'd the figures painted on the Paper. There came
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47786:119"/>
out of it Squibs and Crackers for an hour and a half, or better, before the Castle it self took
fire. Then they set fire to another invention, which they call <hi>Derbende.</hi> It was a kind of Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidge,
about six Inches thick, and three foot long, casting, at first, at both ends, a shower of
fire, and afterwards several Squibs and little Serpents, which falling among the people, set
their Cotton Garments on fire; while they fir'd several sorts of Crackers, which in the air,
were turn'd to Stars and other figures. They set fire also to several boxes; but what we most
admir'd was a great kind of fire-work, which was fasten'd to the ground with great Iron
Chains, and cast out fire at the mouth, with so dreadfull noise, that we were afraid it would
have burst at last, and scatter its fiery entrails among the company. This fire-work they call
<hi>Kumbara.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There were some, who carry'd Paper-Lanthorns upon long Poles, which were also fill'd
with squibs and crackers: but what diverted us most of all, was, that, out of those Lanthorns,
there came a piece of Linnen, which, being folded together, and ty'd up in knots, had, in each
of those knots, several squibs, crackers and serpents, which having much ado to get out, made an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
shew, by the windings which the fire made through all the folds of that piece of cloath.
Others carried in their aprons, a certain composition, into which some that pass'd by let fire
fall, as it were negligently, whereupon, he who carried it shaking his apron, there came out a
great number of Stars, which burnt a long time upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>In these Fire-works, the <hi>Persians</hi> make use of white <hi>Naphte,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>Petreolum:</hi>
but in regard this Drugg is seldome found in <hi>Europe,</hi> there may be used, to the same effect, the
spirit of <hi>Turpentine</hi> rectify'd. We saw also, at a great distance, in the air, certain flames,
which vanish'd as soon in a manner as they appear'd. I conceive these flames proceeded from a
certain Drugg, which the <hi>Muscovites</hi> call <hi>'Plaun,</hi> which is a yellow powder made of a certain
herb, commonly found upon the ground, in the Forests that are planted with Pines and Birch,
and is properly called in Latin, <hi>Acanthus,</hi> in French, <hi>Branche ursine,</hi> in English, <hi>Bears-foot,</hi> or
<hi>Bears-britch.</hi> Every stalk of this herb hath on it two Buttons, which are ripe in <hi>August,</hi> and
then the <hi>Muscovites</hi> are very carefull to gather them, dry them in an Oven, beat them, and
keep the powder which comes from them in Ox-bladders, to be sold by the pound. It is us'd
also in Medicine, as being a drier, and is administred with good success in Wounds, and the
Itch. But the <hi>Muscovites</hi> use it for the most part in their Divertisements, putting it into a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box
made like a Pyramid, into which they thrust that end of a Torch which is not lighted, and
by that means make the powder come out, which being very small, immediately fastens on the
flame, and is lighted, and disappears almost at the same time; so that continually thrusting in
the Torch, a man makes ever and anon a new flame, which is very lively, and makes the nobler
shew, in that it is not accompany'd with any smoke. This powder will not take fire, if it be
not stirr'd after the foresaid manner: for if it be cast upon burning coals, or if a lighted candle
be thrust into it, it would not take fire.</p>
                     <p>These Fire-works entertain'd us so long, that it was after mid-night ere we came to
our Quarters, where we found not any thing colder than the Hearth; for out of a presumption,
that the Governour would have treated us at Supper, there had been nothing provided at
home.</p>
                     <p>The next day,<note place="margin">The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Hossein</hi> reprrsented</note> very betimes in the Morning, before the Sun was to be seen over the Horizon,
the <hi>Persians</hi> made a Procession, which was to represent the interment of <hi>Hossein.</hi> In this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
there were carried a great many <hi>Eschders</hi> and Banners, and there were led several excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Horses and Camels, cover'd with blew Cloath, in which were to be seen many Arrows
quilted, as if they had been purposely shot into it, representing those which the Enemies had
shot at <hi>Hossein.</hi> Upon these Horses rid so many Boyes, who had before them empty Cossins,
upon which they had cast a little Straw, or Hay, and they represented the great affliction of the
Children of <hi>Hossein.</hi> Upon some of those Horses, they had set fair Turbants, Cimitars, Bows,
and Quivers, full of Arrows.</p>
                     <p>As soon as the Sun was up,<note place="margin">A bloody devotion.</note> there might be seen in the base-Court, a very great number of
men, who let themselves Blood in the arms, in so great quantity, that a man would have
thought there had been many Oxen kill'd there. The young Lads slash'd and cut themselves
above the Elbow, and clapping the Wounds with their hands, they made the Blood spurt out
all over the Arm, and about the Body, and in that condition they ran up and down the City.
This was done in remembrance of the effusion of the innocent Blood of <hi>Hossein;</hi> out of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
that, by this action, they expiated some part of their sins; which perswasion is the
stronger, in as much as they are prepossess'd with an opinion, that those, who dye during this
Festival, are infallibly saved. They speak also with the same assurance of their Salvation, who
dye during the Festival of <hi>Aly,</hi> and in their Lent.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the City of <hi>Ardebil,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ardebil <hi>described.</hi>
                        </note> which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Ardevil,</hi> and may be found in Maps
under the name of <hi>Ardonil,</hi> it lies in the Province of <hi>Adirbeitzan,</hi> by the antients called <hi>Media
Major,</hi> the chief Cities whereof are <hi>Ardebil, Tabris,</hi> or <hi>Tauris, Merrague, Natschan,
Miane, Urumi, Choi, Salmas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ardebil</hi> is one of the most antient and most celebrious Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47786:119"/>
of all the Kingdome, not only by reason of the residence which several Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> made
there, but also particularly upon this accompt, that <hi>Schich Sefi,</hi> Author of their Sect, liv'd and
dy'd there. Some are of opinion, that it may be conjectur'd, from the History of <hi>Quintus
Curtius,</hi> that it is the City which he calls <hi>Arbela.</hi> In this Citie are to be seen the Tombs and
Monuments of the Kings of <hi>Persia;</hi> and it is a place of so great Traffick, that it may be justly
numbred among the most considerable of all the East. The <hi>Turkish</hi> Language is much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
among the Inhabitants, than the <hi>Persian.</hi> I found the elevation of the Pole there,
to be at thirty eight degrees, five minutes, and the longitude to be 82. degrees, 30. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes.</p>
                     <p>It is seated in the midst of a great Plain which is above three Leagues about, and compass'd of
all sides by a high Mountain like an Amphitheatre, the highest part whereof, called <hi>Sabelhan,</hi> which
lies West-ward from the City, is alwayes cover'd with Snow. Towards the South-South-West,
lies that Mountain of the Province of <hi>Kiban,</hi> which is called <hi>Bakru.</hi> It is from these Mountains
it proceeds, that the Air there is sometimes extremely hot somtimes extremely cold; insomuch that
even in <hi>August,</hi> they begin to be sensible of the inconveniences of Autumn, as also to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with those Epidemical Diseases, which reign there every year, and commonly carry away
a great number of persons. Nor was our Quarters free from them. For besides the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of servants who fell sick, the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> and our Physician lay in of a Feaver,
but especially the latter, who was reduc'd to that lowness, that there was no hope of Life. In
the greatest heat of the day, and exactly at noon, there rose a kind of a Whirle-wind, which
fill'd the whole City with dust; but it lasted not above an hour. The rest of the day and night
is calm, which gave occasion to the <hi>Persian</hi> Proverb, <hi>Saba Ardebil, Nimrus Kardebil,</hi> that is,
<hi>In the morning Ardebil, at noon, full of dust.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet is it not the cold quality of the Climate,<note place="margin">The air not so warm as elsewhere.</note> but its Situation that hinders the earth there to
produce Wine, Melons, Citrons, Orenges, and Pomegranates, which are to be had in almost
all the other Provinces of <hi>Persia.</hi> Apples, Pears, and Peaches thrive very well there. Which
is to be understood of the City it self, and the Plain, in which it is seated: for the Air is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
more hot and more temperate at the foot of the Mountain; whence it comes; that;
thereabouts,<note place="margin">The ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of its soil.</note> you have all sorts of Fruits, and the Trees, which, in <hi>April,</hi> do but begin to bud
about <hi>Ardebil,</hi> were very forward at the Village of <hi>Alaru,</hi> at the foot of the Mountain <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kru.</hi>
This particular of fruits only excepted, the soil thereabouts is very good, as well for
arable Lands as Pastures: insomuch that the Plain, which is not very great, is able to maintain
the Inhabitants of above sixty Villages, all which may be seen from the City. Besides all which,
the Revenue which is rais'd for the King, from the <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Turkish</hi> Shepherds, is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
by reason of the Liberty allow'd them to feed their Cattel thereabouts, and to Trade
therewith in those parts, after they have purchas'd the <hi>Schach</hi>'s Protection, or embrac'd the
Religion of the <hi>Persians.</hi> Some of the Clarks belonging to the Farmers of the Revenue assured
me, that within fifteen dayes before, there had pass'd over the City-Bridge above a hundred
thousand sheep, and for every sheep, they pay four <hi>Kasbeki,</hi> or two pence <hi>sterl,</hi> for their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturage,
and as much when the owner sells them. This last duty is called <hi>Tzaubanbeki;</hi> and the
other <hi>Abschur Eleschur,</hi> or the duty of Water and Herbage, which the <hi>Turks</hi> call in one word

                     <p>The City is somewhat, but very little, bigger than that of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> but hath no Walls.
No House but hath its Garden, so that, seen at a distance, it seems rather a Forest, than a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Yet are there no other Trees about it than Fruit-Trees, inasmuch as the Country produce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Wood fit for Building, nor indeed any for Firing, the Inhabitants are oblig'd to supply
themselves, out of the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> which is six good dayes Journey distant from it.
Within a League of the City, South-ward, lies a Village named <hi>Scamasbu,</hi> out of which rises
a little River called <hi>Balachlu.</hi> Before it comes into the City, it divides it self into two branches,
one whereof divides the City, and the other compasses it; and is joyned again to the other, and
so fall together into the River <hi>Karasu.</hi> It is so apt to over-flow in the moneth of <hi>April,</hi> when
the Snow upon the Mountains begins to dissolve, that if the Inhabitants of the Plain had not
the industry to divert it by Trenches, which they make on that side which is towards the City,
it would drown them all.</p>
                     <p>Of such an inundation, there happened an Example in the time of <hi>Schach Abas,</hi> when the
violence of the water having broken the Dikes, over-threw in a moment a great number of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
in regard, the Walls, being built only of Mortar and Bricks bak'd in the Sun, there is
not any able to stand out against the least inundation: so that the River caried away their
Housholdstuff, nay many Children in their Cradles; as it had also near happened at the time
of our being there, upon the 12. of <hi>April,</hi> when there were a thousand men at work day and
night in making Chanels, and in turning the River by means of a Trench, which was made in
the plain upon the River side, which over-flow'd all the adjacent fields. The City besides a
great number of narrow strees,<note place="margin">Its Streets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> hath five very fair and broad ones, named <hi>Derwana, Tabar,
Niardower, Kumbalan,</hi> and <hi>Kasirkuste:</hi> in all which they have been at the pains of planting
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47786:120"/>
both sides with Elms and Linden-Trees, to have some shade against the excessive heats of the
Climate.</p>
                     <p>The Market-place, or <hi>Maydan,</hi> is large and noble, as being above three hundred paces in
length,<note place="margin">Its Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place.</note> and a hundred and fifty in breadth, and having, on all sides, Shops so orderly dispos'd
that no Merchandise, no Profession but hath its particular quarter. On the right hand as you
come into it, you find, behind the Sepulchre of <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi> and the last Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> a
<hi>Metzid</hi> or <hi>Mosquey,</hi> in which lies interred <hi>Iman Sade,</hi> or one of the Children of their
twelve Saints. Malefactors and Criminals may retire thither for a certain time, and thence
easily get to the Monument of <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi>

of the Market-place, you come to a place which they call <hi>Basar,</hi> where the first thing you
meet with is a great square arched Building, called <hi>Kaiserie,</hi> where are sold all the precious
Commodities of the Country, as Gold and Silver <hi>Brocadoes,</hi> and all sorts of precious stones,
and silk stuffs,. As you come out thence, you enter, by three Gates, into so many streets, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
over head, all beset with Shops, where are sold all sorts of Commodities. There are also
in these streets, several <hi>Caravanseras</hi> or Store-houses, built for the convenience of forein Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
as <hi>Turks, Tartars, Indians,</hi> &amp;c. We saw there also two <hi>Chineses,</hi> who had brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to be sold, Porcelane, and several things of <hi>Lacque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are also in the City a very great number of publick Baths, and <hi>Metzids,</hi> the chiefest
whereof is that which they call,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Its</hi> Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zids <hi>or</hi> Mosqueys.</note> 
                        <hi>Metzid Adine,</hi> which is seated upon a little Hill, as it were
in the midst of the City, and hath a very fair Steeple. There, the greatest Devotions are done,
on holy-days, and particularly on <hi>Friday,</hi> from which it derives the name. At the entrance of
the <hi>Metzid,</hi> or Church, there is a Fountain, which the late <hi>Saru Chotze,</hi> otherwise called
<hi>Mahomet Risa,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Persia;</hi> brought to that place, by a Chanel under
ground, from the very source, which is in a Mountain above a League distant from the City,
South-west-ward.</p>
                     <p>The Sumptuous Monuments of <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi> and the last Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> are near the <hi>Mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.</hi>
The <hi>Persians</hi> call that place, <hi>Mesar,</hi> and <hi>Kibel-Chan,</hi> Governour of the City did us
the favour to let us into them, upon <hi>Whitsun-Monday.</hi> He sent us word before hand, that,
since we were so desirous to see the holy Sepulchre, we must be oblig'd to abstain from
VVine that day, and that our Supper should be brought us out of <hi>Schich-Sefi</hi>'s Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadors went thither immediately after Dinner,<note place="margin">The Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors visit <hi>Sehich-Sefi</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.</note> attended by all their Retinue, and
their Guards. The Gate, at which we entred, to get into the first Court, is a very large
one, and above it there was a great silver Chain, reaching from one side to the other, at
which there hung such another perpendiculary in the middle. It is a Present, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga-Chan,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Merrague,</hi> had, out of Devotion, made to the holy Sepulchre.
This first Court is very spacious. and pav'd all over with broad stones, having on both sides
great Vaults, where there are many Shops, and backwards a very fair publick Garden, open
to all.</p>
                     <p>The Governour, having receiv'd us in the Base-Court, brought us to another Gate, over
which there was also a Silver-Chain like the former, and it was an expression of the Devotion
of <hi>Mahomed-Chan,,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lay down their Arms at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</note> Governour of <hi>Kentza.</hi> At the entrance of this Gate, they demanded
our Arms,, it being not lawful to carry any, of any kind whatsoever, to the place where the
Sepulchre is; insomuch that if a <hi>Persian</hi> were found but with a knife about him, it would cost
him his life. The threshold of this Gate, as also of all the following Gates, was of white
Marble, and round, and notice was given us not to set our foot upon it, but to step over it, the
right foot foremost, out of this reflection, that having been kiss'd by so many Millions of
Millions of persons, it were, as they said, very irrational that our feet should prophane it.
Thence we enter'd into another Court, which was at least as long as the first, but much nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower,
and pav'd after the same manner, having vaults and shops on both sides as the other.
On the right hand, there came out of the Wall, by a brass-Cock, a fair Fountain (the water
whereof was brought a League distance thence) that they might drink, who retir'd thither out
of Devotion. At the end of this Court, on the right hand, we were shew'd a very fair and
spacious Vault arched above, pav'd without, with green and blew stones, and within, hung
with Tapistry. In the midst of this Vault, there were two fair brass Candlesticks with lights
in them. All along the Walls sate several Priests, cloath'd in white, who sung as loud as ever
they were able, expressing a great humility, and an extraordinary Devotion, by a continual
moving from one side to the other; which motion was performed by them all at the same
time, and with the same shaking, and that with so much exactness, that a man would have
thought they had been all fasten'd to the same Cord, and that they had been all drawn at the
same time.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Schich-Sefi</hi>'s Fast of forty days.</note> This place is called <hi>Thschillachane,</hi> in regard <hi>Schich-Sefi</hi> retired thither every year,
to fast, eating only, for 40 days together, but one Almond a day, at least if we may believe
the Relations of the <hi>Persians.</hi> Thence, we pass'd through a third Gate, over which there hung
also a Silver-Chain, bestow'd on the place, by <hi>Alli-Chan,</hi> Governour of <hi>Kappan,</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47786:120"/>
Court which was less than the two precedent, and pav'd all over with little square-stones
of several colours. We entred into the place where the Sepulchre was, by a Gate which was
built like a great Tower, the Clappers whereof were all cover'd with plates of silver, and
adorn'd with several Rings of the same Metal, which Gate brought us into a great Structure.
The pavement before the Gate was cover'd with Tapistry, to express the holiness of the place;
and we were told, that, for the said reason, it was expected, we should put off our
shooes.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadors, at first, made some difficulty to render that respect, to a place, for which
they could not have any Veneration, but perceiving, that if they did it not, they would not have
been permitted to go in, they at last resolv'd to comply with the custom. The <hi>Persians,</hi> to let
them know, they did not any thing, that might abate ought of their Dignity, told them, that
<hi>Schach-Abas</hi> himself, when he came to see the Sepulchre, many times, put off his shooes when
he was come within half a League of the City, and came so far bare-foot; but that they could
not expect that Devotion from us. We pass'd thence into a very fair spacious Gallery, hung,
and cover'd with Tapistry: and afterwards, we entred by another Gate, cover'd with plates of
Gold, into another Sumptuous Structure which was Arch'd all about. <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> being
upon the point of his departure, into the War he was then engag'd in against the <hi>Vsbeques Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
made a vow, and promis'd, to bestow a Golden Gate on the Sepulchre of <hi>Schich-Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>i,</hi> at
<hi>Ardehil,</hi> and another upon <hi>Iman Risa</hi>'s at <hi>Chorasan,</hi> if his Armies had the success he expected:
which vow he very religiously performed, immediately upon his return, having had all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
over his Enemies that his own heart could have wish'd. This Vault was about four fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
square, and was enlightned by a great number of Gold and Silver Lamps; among which
there were some, above three foot Diameter. On both sides sate twelve <hi>Hasifahns,</hi> or Priests,
having before them, upon Desks, great books of Parchment, wherein were written, in Capital
<hi>Arabian</hi> Characters, certain Chapters of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> which they sung, much after the same
manner, as our Monks do their Vespers, but with the same motion as we had observ'd at the
<hi>Tschillachane.</hi> Having gone through that Vault, we came to another appartment, which was
divided from it only by a Silver Rail, though rais'd higher by three silver steps, to get up into
it. The Governour, and our Interpreter <hi>Rustan,</hi> having kiss'd those steps, he went into it with
the Ambassadors, who took along with them four persons of their Retinue. This apartment
was much more richly adorn'd than any of the rest, and there was at one end of it another place
rais'd a foot from the ground, the Rails whereof were of massy Gold. It is behind that Rail or
Partition, that the Sepulchre of <hi>Schich-Sefi</hi> is to be seen, built of white Marble, and not of
Gold, as some have written. It was cover'd with Crimson Velvet, and rais'd three foot from
the ground, being about nine foot in length, and four in breadth. From the Roof, there hung
certain Lamps of Gold and Silver, and on both sides, two huge Candlesticks of massy Gold, in
which there were set great Wax Candles, lighted in the night time.</p>
                     <p>The Door of that Golden Rail was lock'd,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Laicks</hi> not permitted to appreach the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre.</note> and though the Ambassadors were very importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to have it opened, yet could they not prevail, the <hi>Persians</hi> telling them, that the Laicks,
even to the King himself, were not permitted to come within that place. In the same apartment
where we then were, was to be seen, on the left hand, in a particular Vault, the Sepulchre of
<hi>Schach Ismael,</hi> the first of that name; as also that of <hi>Scach-Sefi</hi>'s Wife, and those of some
other Queens of <hi>Persia:</hi> but we were permitted to see no more of them, than we could discover
at the meeting of the Curtains, which were drawn at the entrance of it: and from what we
could judge thereof, there was nothing remarkable. There came all along after us a grave old
man, who, with a perfuming-pot in his hand, purify'd the places, through which we had
pass'd.</p>
                     <p>Having taken notice of all that was to be seen in that place,<note place="margin">A miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Vault.</note> we were conducted through the
same Gallery, towards the right hand, into another spacious apartment, which was Arch'd all
about and Gilt; where we could not but admire the manner of its building, which being near
as large as a fair Church, was nevertheless sustain'd by the strength of the Roof, and without
Pillars.<note place="margin">The Library</note> This Hall is called <hi>Tzenetsera,</hi> and serves for a Library. The books were lay'd in
Drawers, shuffled one upon another, without any order, but otherwise well enough kept.
They were all Manuscripts, some, upon Parchment, others upon Paper, most in <hi>Arabick,</hi>
and some in the <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Turkish</hi> Languages, but all excellently painted, richly bound, and
cover'd with Plates of Gold and Silver, carv'd, and branch'd. The books of History were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd
with several representations in colours. In the Neeches of the Vault, there were above
three or four hundred Vessels of Porcelane; some, so large, as that they contain'd above 40.
quarts or Liquour. These only are used at the entertainments, which are brought from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,
to the King and other great Lords, who pass that way: for the holiness of that
place permits not that they should make use of any Gold or Silver. Nay, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi> that he, out of an excessive humility, made use onely of Woodden
Dishes.</p>
                     <p>Thence we were brought to the Kitchin,<note place="margin">The Kitchin</note> the Door whereof was also cover'd with Plates of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47786:121"/>
Silver, and all things within it were so handsomly ordered, that it was not a little to be admire'd.
The great Cauldrons were all set in a row, and seal'd within the Wall, along which pass'd a
Pipe, which, by divers Cocks, supply'd all the Kitchin with water.</p>
                     <p>The Cooks of all degrees had every one his place,<note place="margin">The Charity of the place.</note> according to their functions and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
This Kitchin maintains every day above a thousand persons, accompting those belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the house, and the poor, among whom they distribute thrice a day, Pottage, Rice, and
Meat; to wit, in the morning at six, at ten, and, in the after-noon at three. The two mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-meals
are upon the accompt of <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi> who, to that end, lay'd a foundation of fifty
Crowns per diem; and the third is an Alms bestow'd there, by order from the King of <hi>Persia.</hi>
Besides these, there are so many Alms distributed there upon the accompt of private persons,
that there is not only enough to maintain the poor, but there is much over and above, which is
sold to those who are asham'd to beg. At the time of these meals or distributions, they sound
two Timbrels, which, as they say, were brought from <hi>Medina,</hi> with the Banner of <hi>Fatima,</hi>
by <hi>Schach Sedredin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Going out of the Kitchin, we entred into a very fair Garden, where we saw the Sepulchres of

                        <hi>Schich-Sedredin</hi> ordered his Sepulchre to be built,<note place="margin">A Fable.</note> after the death of his Father, by an Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
whom he had brought along with him from <hi>Medina,</hi> and according to a Model which he
drew of it himself by Miracle (for the <hi>Persians</hi> affirm, that both he and his Father wrought
many) which was, that having commanded the Architect to shut his eyes, he ravish'd him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an extasie, during which, he gave him a sight of the Model, according to which he would
have that Structure built, and according to which it was afterwards done. <hi>Schich-Tzinid,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereto the great Court, and several Houses, augmented it so as that now it seems a very
noble and spacious Castle, whither there comes every day so great a number of persons, to
Discourse, or Walk, that there are few Princes Courts where there are more seen. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of several Kings, its vast Revenues, and the Presents which are daily made thereto, do
so augment the Wealth of it, that some conceive, its Treasure amounts to many Millions of
Gold, and that, in case of necessity, this <hi>Mesar</hi> might raise and maintain a very powerfull
Army, and that it would furnish more ready Money than the King could himself. Besides the
Farms and Dairies which depend on it, it hath within the City of <hi>Ardebil</hi> two hundred Houses,
nine publick Baths, eight <hi>Caravanseras,</hi> or Store-houses, that great Vault, which is called
the <hi>Kaiserie,</hi> all the <hi>Meydan,</hi> with its Vaults and Shops, a hundred other Shops in the <hi>Basar,</hi>
and the Market-places, where Cattel, Wheat, Salt, and Oyl are sold. The <hi>Astasnischin,</hi> or
Regraters and Hucksters, and those who sell Commodities in open Market, having neither
Shops, nor Stalls, pay certain duties thereto. It is possess'd, about <hi>Ardebil,</hi> of thirty three
Towns or Villages; and in the Province of <hi>Serab,</hi> of five Villages. In the City of <hi>Tauris,</hi> it hath
sixty Houses, and a hundred Shops, and two Villages without the City; several <hi>Caravanseras</hi>
and Baths, in the City of <hi>Casuan,</hi> as also in the Province of <hi>Kilan</hi> and <hi>Astara.</hi> The duties
of <hi>Abschur</hi> and <hi>Eleschur,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Mokan</hi> belong to it, and one moyety of those of
<hi>Chalchat, Kermeruth,</hi> and <hi>Haschteruth,</hi> not accounting what the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who
make profession of the <hi>Persian</hi> Religion send thither, nor the Presents, which are brought from
all parts, in consequence of the Vows, which they are wont to make, in great Journeys, in
their Sickness, nay indeed in any business of Importance, which they very Religiously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
Besides all these, there are so many Gifts, Donations and Legacies made to it, that there
passes not a day, but a man shall see going thither Horses, Asses, Camels, Sheep, Money, and
other things. All these things are receiv'd by two Persons, who are oblig'd by an Oath to be
faithful to that sacred place, and they are called <hi>Nessurtzchan,</hi> from the word <hi>Nesur,</hi> which
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47786:121"/>
signifies a Vow, and they have an allowance out of the revenue of a fair Village, which is
within half a League of the City, called <hi>Sultanabath;</hi> which was granted by <hi>Schich Ismael,</hi> to
that purpose.<note place="margin">Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the reception of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</note> These Commissaries are every day in an apartment on the left hand. as a man
goes into the <hi>Metzid Tzillachane,</hi> and are set on both sides of a Chest or Box, cover'd with
crimson Velver, into which they put the Money that is brought them, as they do also that
which arises by the sale of those Horses, Camels and Asses, which are bestow'd on the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre:
for the Oxen and Sheep are kill'd, and distributed among the poor. They give those
who bring them a small Present, which is a handful of Anniseed; and they are given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
thereby, that their Souls shall enjoy serenity and blisse in the other
VVorld.</p>
                     <p>They also give the Pilgrims who come thither to do their Devotions, a Certificate of their
being there, and of the Prayers they said there; which serves not only for a Testimony of the
profession of their Religion, but also for a protection against several disgraces and misfortunes.
nay, which is more, for the saving of their Lives. Accordingly, our Interpreter <hi>Rustan,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
resolv'd to leave us, and fearing what might follow upon the complaint which the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
should make to the King of him, took three authentick Copies of such a Certificate,
whereof two were found among his Cloaths, after his departure, and presented, at our
return, by the Ambassador <hi>Crusius,</hi> to his Highness of <hi>Holstein,</hi> in whose Library, they are
still to be seen.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> call these Certificates <hi>Sijaretname,</hi> and they are given, not only here, at the
Sepulchre of <hi>Schich Sefi,</hi> but also at <hi>Meschet,</hi> at that of <hi>Iman Risa,</hi> and these latter are as
efficacious, and have the same authority as the former. Now that it may be understood how
Certificates are able to save the Lives, either of a Malefactor, or a person fallen into disgrace
at the Court, I shall here allege an example of it. Not long before the time of our Travels into
those parts, it happened, that <hi>Tzirra-Chan,</hi> who was a person of quality, and one so highly
in favour with <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi> that he concluded a Marriage between him and one of the Ladies of
his <hi>Seraglio,</hi> coming one day somewhat late to Dinner, the King ask'd him the reason of it, and
said to him, smiling, that it must needs be the caresses of his new Married Wife, kept him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
so long.<note place="margin">The confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Favourite,</note> He had the boldness to make answer, that his Majesty had not miss'd the mark
much, that indeed he had been dallying with a Woman, but that it had been with the Wife
of <hi>Agasi-Beg,</hi> who was then in the room, and discharg'd the Office of <hi>Steward,</hi> when <hi>Tzirra-Chan</hi>
told the story. The King was so startled at that insolence, that, blushing, out of vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and shame together, he knew not how to lift up his eyes, to look on either of them: which
<hi>Tzerra-Chan</hi> observing, and inferring thence, that he had said too much, rose from Table and
went to his own House. As soon as the King had taken notice of his departure, he call'd <hi>Agasi,</hi>
and said to him, <hi>Thou hast seen,</hi> Agasi, <hi>after what manner</hi> Tzirra, <hi>not thinking it enough to
have dishonour'd thy House, must needs make ostentation of his lewdness, and reproach thee with
thy infamy, and have the confidence to do it in my presence: Go thy ways, and bring me his head.
Agasi</hi> obey'd, and went his way; but about some two hours after, the King much wondring
to find that <hi>Agasi</hi> was not return'd, sends after him, to know what was become of him. The
King had this account brought him, that <hi>Tzirra</hi> and <hi>Agasi</hi> had been found, like very good
friends, making merry, and drinking together. Whereupon, the King not able to forbear
laughing, cries out, <hi>ja Kurrumsak, O the poor Cuckold:</hi> but immediately after, reflecting on
their procedure, and imagining, that it was joynt design between them to put the affront up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him,<note place="margin">Insolence punished.</note> and that they laugh'd at him in their sleeves; he Commanded <hi>Aliculi-Chan,</hi> Brother
to <hi>Rustan, Chan</hi> of <hi>Tauris, Divanbeg,</hi> or Judge of the Province, to go and fetch both their
heads. In the mean time, <hi>Agasi</hi> coming to himself, and considering that the King never jest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in things of that nature, and that he might well come to repent his neglect in executing his
Commission, took leave of the company and withdrew; but <hi>Tzirra,</hi> confident of the King's
favour, and presuming on the familiarity there had been between them, was so imprudent as
to stay, as it were expecting the effects of his Prince's indignation, and had his Head cut off.
<hi>Agasi,</hi> making his advantage of <hi>Tzirra</hi>'s death, went in the mean time to the Sepulchre of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Rise,</hi> whence he brought one of those Certificates, wherewith, some moneths after, he
presented himself before the King; who, perceiving him coming at a distance, could not forbear
laughing, and said to him, <hi>I commend thee for thy wit, my honest kind hearted Cuckold, go thy
ways, I pardon thee for</hi> Iman Risa<hi>'s sake; come, kiss my foot.</hi> Thus did this <hi>Sijaretname</hi> or Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate,
save <hi>Agasi Bek</hi>'s his life, who was afterwards entertain'd again into the <hi>Schach</hi>'s ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
not indeed in the quality of Steward, but only as a Gentleman belonging to his
Chamber.</p>
                     <p>Yet is it not to be thought, but that these Secretaries, of whom such Certificates are obtained,
are gulity of frauds and connivances in the disposal of them, by delivering them signed and seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with blanks to put in the names of such as may have occasion for them; as may be seen by
the Copy which is in his Highness's Library at <hi>Gottorp.</hi> Of <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi> his Life and Miracles,
we shall give an account hereafter, when we come to treat of the Religion of the
<hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:47786:122"/>
In the same Village af <hi>Kelheran,</hi> about a League and a half from <hi>Ardcbil,</hi> there is another
sumptuous sepulchre, built in honour of <hi>Seid-Tsebrail,,</hi> the Father of <hi>Schich-Sefi.</hi> He was a
poor Peasant,<note place="margin">Another Saint's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.</note> who not able to pretend to any thing particular, which might distinguish him
from the other Inhabitants of the place, had also his Burial common with them. But <hi>Sedredin,</hi>
finding the reputation of his Father's Sanctity so well establish'd, that it was become in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Hereditary in his Person, would needs have it return backwards to his Grand-father, and
to that end, caus'd his Relicks to be uncover'd, and honour'd them with a Sepulchre, at the
place where it is now to be seen. Some affirm, that in the same Tomb are kept the bones of
<hi>Seid-Sala,</hi> and <hi>Seid Kudbedin,</hi> Father and Grandfather of <hi>Tzebrail:</hi> but others would have all
the honour done to <hi>Seid Tzebrail</hi> alone. And it is possible they may be all mistaken, it being
very hard, that, after so many years, their bones and ashes could be distinguish'd from those
of so many others.</p>
                     <p>The Tomb it self stood in the midst of a large Garden,<note place="margin">The Tomb described.</note> and was built absolutely round, rais'd
ten steps from the ground, adorn'd all about with glass of all sorts of colours, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by Iron-grates, and had in the midst of its Roof, a great round Tower, built of blew
and green Stones. Those of our retinue, who were desirous to go into it, were forc'd to
leave their shooes and Boots at the door, as also their Swords and their Canes. The building
within was of admirable Architecture. The Roof, which was Azure Gilt, was joyn'd by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Pillars,
through which the light came in. The floor was cover'd with the richest kind of
Tapistry, and the Walls, which were open of all sides, had in them other little Partitions, or
Vaults, where they taught Children to read and sing the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> so to enable them in
time to become <hi>Hasisans,</hi> or Guardians of that Holy Sepulchre. We found here and there, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
little seats, Books lying open, in order to the singing of their Service, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as we had seen at the sepulchre of <hi>Schich-Sefi.</hi> The Tomb was about a man's height, and
an Ell and a half in breadth, of Joyners work, all the Junctures being done over with little
plates of Copper, and all cover'd with a piece of green Velvet. Over the Tomb hung four
Lamps, whereof two were of Gold, the other two of Silver, which two <hi>Tziragts Chihan,</hi> or
snuffers, were oblig'd to light at the cloze of the Evening, and to keep in all Night. Over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Tomb, there was a little Chapel, kept for the Sepulchre of several other persons of
the same Family of <hi>Schich-Sefi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the sanctity of the place,<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Ardebil</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters an Oath to the religious men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre.</note> it proceeds, that the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Ardebil,</hi> administers an Oath to
the Religious men of the place, for their fidelity thereto, as well as their allegiance to the King,
as being oblig'd joyntly to serve that Holy-sepulchre and the King; whence it may be inferr'd,
he hath a certain spiritual Jurisdiction as well as the temporal. As a privilege whereof, as also
upon the accompt of the situation of his City, which is no Frontier, and consequently not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the invasion of the <hi>Turk,</hi> the Governour is freed of the charge of maintaining that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of soldiers, which the other Governours are oblig'd to raise and keep, out of the Revenue
of their Governments.</p>
                     <p>His Retinue was very well ordered, not exceeding fifty persons, to whom his own Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Life serv'd for an Example. He treated us three several times, but was guilty of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and seem'd to be very temperate in all things, save that he took abundance of Tobacco, suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it through a Pipe of Cane which was put into a glass of Water, according to the <hi>Persian</hi>
mode, and drunk very much <hi>Cahwa,</hi> or <hi>Coffee,</hi> to moderate the insurrections of the Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.</p>
                     <p>What is most remarkable about <hi>Ardebil,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Medicinal Waters.</note> is the sources of Medicinal waters, whereof there
is a great number, and of several sorts, whether in order to Health or Divertisement, to which
the <hi>Chan</hi> or Governour, proffer'd to bring us, and would have done it, had not the Ambass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
indisposition, who was then sick, prevented him.</p>
                     <p>What we can say of them upon the relations of the <hi>Persians,</hi> is, that, at the foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Sebelan,</hi> there is a source called <hi>Serdebe,</hi> over which <hi>Sulfakar-Chan,</hi> whom we mention'd
before, built a spacious Vaulted apartment. Its water which is almost luke-warm, and as clear as it
is possible water can be, makes a very pleasant Bath.</p>
                     <p>Three Leagues thence, on the right side of the same Mountain, there is another source, the
waters whereof are so Sulphureous and so corrupt,<note place="margin">Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> that they infect all the circumambient air.
It is excellent good for the Itch, upon which accompt it is called <hi>Abcotur,</hi> a word which in
the <hi>Persian</hi> Language signifies that disease.</p>
                     <p>Out of the same Mountain,<note place="margin">Sources of hot water.</note> but from another part of it, there arise three other Springs of hot
or boyling water, called <hi>Meul, Daudan,</hi> and <hi>Randau.</hi> The first rises out of a little Hill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two sources of cold water. <hi>Daudau</hi> hath also not far from it a cold Spring, the water
whereof is us'd to allay the contrary qualities, by the mixture of their waters, which are brought
by several Conduits into the publick Baths.<note place="margin">Serpents discover the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness of the water.</note> 
                        <hi>Daudau</hi> is admirable for the several effects it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,
being sometimes very wholsome, sometimes of no use at all. To know when it may be
us'd with success, they have this observation, that there may be seen in the water Serpents,
which have on their heads other little white Serpents, set round about them like a Crown. When
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47786:122"/>
there are none of these to be seen in it, the water hath no vertue, so that it is to no purpose to
bath in it.</p>
                     <p>About half a League from the City, upon the right side of the High-way, there is a Pond,
or rather a standing Pool, called <hi>Schercol,</hi> which is cover'd all over with great pieces of Salt-Peter
and Salt, as with a crust of Ice, whither such as are troubled with the Itch, go and bath
themselves.</p>
                     <p>Having staid two full moneths at <hi>Ardebil,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">JUNE.</note> the first of <hi>Iune,</hi> came thither a <hi>Mehemander</hi> named
<hi>Abasculi-Beg,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The King sends the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor.</note> with orders from the King for our immediate departure thence, he being charg'd
to bring us within six weeks to the Court, where he said the Ambassadors were with much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
expected. But being himself an antient man, and consequently not fit to be over-ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in travelling, he left with us his son, whose care it was to conduct us to <hi>Ispahan.</hi> These
new orders oblig'd <hi>Netzefbeg,</hi> who had been our <hi>Mehemander</hi> from <hi>Scamachie,</hi> to take leave
of us. We requited, in some measure, his civilities towards us, with a Present of four pair
of Sables, five Ells of dark grey Cloath, four Ells of green Satin, the like quantity of blew
Satin of <hi>Genua,</hi> and four bottles of Aquavitae.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abasculi</hi> did all that lay in his power to hasten our departure, and was so earnest to find us all
necessary conveniences, that he caus'd the Horses and Camels to be brought to the very Doors of
our Lodgings, the more to oblige us to send away the Baggage. But the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi>
who was resolv'd to have the brass-pieces, which he had kept till then, brought away along
with us, would needs, in defiance of all perswasion to the contrary, have carriages made for
them. Which to satisfie him in, the <hi>Mehemander</hi> was forc'd to make use of certain Trees,
which were an Ornament to the City, after many remonstrances, of the impossibility which
he told us we should meet with by the way, to draw Artillery after us. So that we found our
selves insensibly engag'd to make a longer stay there than we expected; for, though they us'd
all possible diligence to make the said Carriages, yet was our journey put off for eight dayes
longer.</p>
                     <p>At last, all things being ready, there was sent to the <hi>Chan</hi> three pair of the best kind of Sables,
whereof the <hi>Persians</hi> make very great account, a striking-Clock, a Chest, or Cellar, containing
twelve bottles of <hi>Ros Solis,</hi> and two pictures, done by our own Painter, representing a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of quality and a Lady, dress'd after the <hi>French</hi> mode. He sent back to the Ambassadors,
each of them an excellent Horse, with their Bridles and Saddles, set out with Silver-plates,
two pieces of Satin, one red the other blew, one piece of Gold and Silver Brocado, one piece
of Cotton-stuff, with flowers of silk, and a piece of Cushion Canvas, with flowers of gold and
silver.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iune</hi> 10. the <hi>Mehemander</hi> brought a hundred and sixty Horses,<note place="margin">They leave <hi>Ardebil.</hi>
                        </note> and twelve Camels, as well
for the Baggage, as the six pieces of Artillery. The next day, we sent away both, and on the
12. followed our selves. The Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> who was yet weak, though recover'd
of his Feaver, was carried in a Horse-Litter, and went away about five in the morning, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by thirty persons of our Retinue. Most of the Inhabitants, who had no notice of our
departure, and had never seen any Litter before, finding it cover'd with Cloath, and compass'd
by men on Horse-back, imagin'd we were going to celebrate some Festival in the Country, and
that the Litter carried the mysteries of our Religion. The Ambassador <hi>Crusius</hi> went away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
eight, with the rest of the Retinue. <hi>Kelbele-Chan</hi> was gone before to a Garden, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the City, expecting the Ambassadors, that he might take leave of them, it being not their
custom, no more than it is in some other places, to conduct Strangers at their departure, with
the same Ceremonies as they had receiv'd them, withall, it being, according to their perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
an incivility, to bring such as they had before kindly entertain'd, out of their Lodgings.
Accordingly, after we had travell'd about a League, we met him in the fields, and with him a
<hi>Sulthan</hi> of <hi>Tabris,</hi> who being Marshal in the <hi>Persian</hi> Army, had about him a considerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of people, who were all cover'd with Tygres and Lynx's skins, and by their countenances
discover'd the quality of their Master. The Governour carried the Ambassador <hi>Crusius</hi> into the
<hi>Ottaks,</hi> or Huts of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> shepherds, not much out of the High-way, whither he had
brought abundance of cold Meat, Fruits and Conserves.</p>
                     <p>Having taken leave of him,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chan</hi> takes leave of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.</note> we prosecuted our journey, over a high and craggy Mountain,
till we came to the Village of <hi>Busum,</hi> which lies in a bottom, four Leagues from <hi>Ardebil.</hi>
There we over-took our Baggage and our Artillery; but the Wheels of the Carriages were so
spent, that the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> was, with much ado, perswaded, that it were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to leave the six greater Pieces there, upon the promise made by the <hi>Mehemander,</hi> that
he would get an order from the King to the Governour of <hi>Ardebil,</hi> to have them sent after us,
and to that end, he took the bore and size of them. We took along with us the two little brass
Pieces, weighing each of them 300. weight, and four murchering Pieces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iune</hi> the 13. we continu'd our journey, through very bad way, and over Mountains with
such dreadfull precipices, that not thinking it safe to trust the Beasts with the Litter, wherein
the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> lay, we had it carried by men. In the Vallies, we found many great
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47786:123"/>
Villages and Huts, and excellent Meadows, all cover'd with fair Cattel. Having travell'd five
Leagues, or better that day, we came at night to a Village called <hi>Sengoa,</hi> where we found a
<hi>Melik,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Chalcal.</hi>
                        </note> or Receiver general of the whole Province of <hi>Chalcal,</hi> which begins at that Village, and
reaches as far as the River <hi>Kisilosein.</hi> His name was <hi>Baindur,</hi> and he had succeeded his Father in
that employment, who had been so much in favour with <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> that with one of
the VVomen of his <hi>Seraglio,</hi> whom he married, he gave him two or three great Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</p>
                     <p>The 14. our way lay still over high Mountains,<note place="margin">The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Persian</hi> Officers.</note> yet in our way, we pass'd through three
Villages, where our <hi>Mehemandar</hi> fail'd not, according to his custom, to take up Horses, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
they were for us, that the Countrey people might be oblig'd to redeem them. Having
travell'd four <hi>farsangs,</hi> or leagues, we came into a very pleasant Valley, where we lodg'd near
a delightfull Spring. And whereas we had some occasion to stay there till the next day at noon,
I had the leasure to observe the height of the Sun there, and found, that we were at thirty seven
degrees,<note place="margin">Grass-hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</note> and twenty minutes of the Line. In this place, we saw green Grass-Hoppers, which
were above three Inches in length, and one and a half in compass.</p>
                     <p>The 15. presently after Dinner, we set forward on our journey, and the Ambassador <hi>Brug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
finding himself a little more hearty, got on Hors-back with the rest. Before we got to the
dreadful Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> which the <hi>Persians</hi> call <hi>Perdelis,</hi> we came to a bottom, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it self to our view like an Abyss. We were two hours in getting down to it, and above
three in getting out of it, though between the points of the Mountains, there seem'd not to be
half a League distance. It is a most dangerous passage for Travellers, who are oblig'd to come
in strong parties, for fear of falling into the hands of Robbers, who discover, at a distance, the
number of passengers, and accordingly judge whether they can engage them, or must let them
alone.</p>
                     <p>There runs through the bottom the River <hi>Kisilosein,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Kisilosein.</note> which falls into it through Rocks and
Precipices, with an inconceivable swiftness, and a noise that stuns the passengers. The waters
of it are whitish; whence it comes that in the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> where it falls into the <hi>Caspian</hi>
Sea, it is, in <hi>Talisman,</hi> called <hi>Isperuth. Schach-Tamas</hi> built a very fair Bridge over it, of Brick,
containing nine Arches. The way was planted on both sides with wild Almond-Trees, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
and <hi>Sena</hi>-Trees. Having cross'd the River, we came to the Ascent, which was very
steepy, though it went still winding till it came to the top of the Mountain, and it was so hard
to get up, that to advance ought, we were many times forc'd to step up as if we got up a pair
of stairs: having in the mean time on our left hand, Precipices and Abysses so dreadfull to
look on, that the Mule of a <hi>Muscovian</hi> Ambassador falling down there, was never after
seen or heard of: insomuch that thinking it not safe to ride it up, we alighted, and led our
Horses.</p>
                     <p>By that time we were got to the top of the Mountain it was night, and that so dark, that we
lost our way, in the absence of our <hi>Mehemandar,</hi> who had stay'd behind in some Villages in
the bottom. We were gotten into very dangerous wayes, and went still a-foot, though the
trouble we had been at, (which had put us all into a sweat) weariness, and the cold, which
beat into our faces, might well have prevail'd with us to make use of our Horses. We were
three whole hours, ere we overcame the darkness of the night, and all other imaginable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences;
but at last about midnight, we got to the Village of <hi>Keintze,</hi> four Leagues from our
last Lodging. We stay'd there all the next day, as well in expectation of our <hi>Mehemandar,</hi>
and to give our Horses a little rest, as to refresh our selves, after the precedent day's weariness,
with the Divertisement, which Wine, our Musick, and the noise of our Artillery could afford
us.<note place="margin">The <hi>Mehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandars</hi> complaint.</note> We intended to give our <hi>Mehemandar</hi> a sharp reprehension, and reproach him with his
negligence; but he soon stopp'd our mouths, telling us, that he could not but acknowledge
himself oblig'd by his charge, to wait on the Ambassadors, and that he should not have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
their service; but that he had not the heart to hear the injurious, and blasphemous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
which fell every foot from the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> which yet should not hinder
him from taking order, that we should be plentifully supply'd with Provisions; wherein,
to give him his due, he failed not, and contributed much to the good Cheer we made that
day.</p>
                     <p>The 17. we left <hi>Keintze,</hi> after the mid-day's great heat was a little over: but our <hi>Mehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandar,</hi>
instead of Conducting us along the High-way, made us turn on the right hand, and
Lodg'd us in a Village, called <hi>Hatzimir,</hi> seated in a bottom, which was, of all sides, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
with Rocks. The <hi>Melik,</hi> or Receiver of the place, treated us with certain Basins of
fruit, Apricocks and Grapes, which were not fully ripe, and a sack of Wine, wherewith we
made a Collation, which serv'd us for a Supper: for our Cook, presuming we should have kept
the High-way, was gone before us with all the Provisions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iune</hi> 18. we got on Horse-back after Sermon, and Dinner, marching after the rate of a full
trot, between two very sleepy Hills, and we came about midnight to the Village of <hi>Kamahl,</hi>
which is two leagues or better out of the High-way, and six from our last Lodging, and we
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47786:123"/>
were Lodg'd in several houses, scatter'd up and down, upon three hills. They had taken up
for the Ambassadors a great unfurnish'd house, at the entrance of the Village; but finding
there was no convenienee at all for them, they refus'd to Lodge there; and having left two of
their Guard upon the Avenues of the Village, to give an account of them to the rest of the Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
they took up other Lodgings, and we after their example, though the Country-people,
who were surpriz'd at our unexpected arrival, and could not so soon get their Wives and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
out of the way, deny'd us entrance, and put us to the necessity of taking up Quarters by
force, half-dead as we were with cold, and spent with hard travelling. But we were hardly
laid down, hoping to rest our selves the remainder of that night, when our Trumpet sounding
to horse,<note place="margin">The <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors Guard.</note> made us get out of our Beds, to see what the matter should be. Being come to the
Trumpetter, he brought us to the Ambassadors Lodgings, where we understood that twenty
<hi>Persians</hi> of the same Village, all hors'd, had set upon, abus'd, and dis-arm'd the Guard which
the Ambassadors had left upon the Avenues of the Village, and that they had kill'd them, if
our Steward, with the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Interpreter, who, by reason of his sickness, had not
been able to follow us, had not come up to their relief, and made the <hi>Persians</hi> draw back,
fearing there might be others coming after them. There was a Lieutenant with twenty Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers
commanded out, to clear the High-ways all about, and all the Retinue were Lodg'd as
near as could be to the Ambassadors.</p>
                     <p>The 19. we continu'd in the same place, where we caus'd Tents to be pitch'd. Here our
Secretary fell sick of a burning Feaver.</p>
                     <p>The next day, being the 20. we departed thence about two in the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Fore-noon, which was extremely hot, through a vast Plain, where we saw only barren
and heathy grounds.<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Senkan.</hi>
                        </note> About noon we came to the little City of <hi>Senkan,</hi> six Leagues from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahl.</hi>
The City is not enclos'd with a Wall, but is otherwise sufficiently well built. Within
half a League of the City, we receiv'd from the Governour of <hi>Sulthanie,</hi> who was then in the
City, a Present of certain Dishes of Apr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cocks and Cowcumbers, which were a great refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to us, in that excessive heat and sultriness of weather.</p>
                     <p>At the extremity of the Suburbs we were met by thirty persons on Horse-back, well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who receiv'd us in the name of the Governour of <hi>Sulthanie,</hi> whose name was <hi>Sewinduc Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi>

Among these Gentlemen there was one, who, though he had neither hands nor feet, yet
made a shift to guide his horse, with as much skill as any of the rest. He was son to one of the
principal Inhabitants of the City, who had been heretofore much in favour with <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi>
the Grand-father of <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi> for his Poems, and other excellent Productions of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
upon the accompt whereof, he was so well respected at Court; that the King not
only granted him the life of his son, who for some Crimes had deserv'd death, but would also
continue him in his favour, contrary to the custom of the Country, according to which all the
relations of a Malefactor, or unfortunate person, participate of his disgrace or misfortune.
The young man had been guilty of strange debauches and extravagances, even to the Ravishing
of Maids and Women in their houses, so often reiterated, that they became at last insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
so that the <hi>Schach</hi> ordered him, to have his hands and feet cut off, and caus'd the
stumps of his arms and legs to be thrust into boyling Butter, to stop the blood. He had
wooden hands, crooked at the extremities, wherewith he made a shift to hold his
Bridle.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Senkan</hi> was heretofore of a considerable bigness,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Senkan</hi> destroyed by <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlane.</hi>
                        </note> and famous for its Trading,
before <hi>Tamberlane</hi> destroy'd it: but what reduc'd it to the condition it is in now, is the <hi>Turk,</hi>
who hath taken and plunder'd it several times. Yet are there some very handsome houses in it,
and those well furnish'd, in which we were entertain'd with much civility, and our sick people
extremely well accommodated. The <hi>Sulthan</hi> came to visit the Ambassadors immediately after
their arrival, and made his excuses that he had not met them; which was upon this score, that
having been wounded in the shoulder at the siege of <hi>Eruan,</hi> and the wound being lately open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he could not have waited on us in person. We sent to him our Physician and Chyrurgeon,
who dress'd him; which he look'd on as so great a kindness, that he thought it not requital e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to send us a Present of several excellent Fruits, but he also doubled the ordinary allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of our Provisions.</p>
                     <p>All about this City, there are only Barren and Sandy grounds, which bring forth only Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars
of about the height of a mans hand.</p>
                     <p>About half a League from it,<note place="margin">A branch of Mount <hi>Taurus.</hi>
                        </note> there may be seen a branch of the Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> which
they call <hi>Peydar Peijamber,</hi> and reaches from North to South, towards <hi>Kurdesthan,</hi> where
may be seen, as they affirm, the Sepulchre of one of the most antient Prophets, from whom
the Mountain derives its name. At the foot of this Mountain there is a very pleasant Valley,
which is checquer'd up and down with a great number of Villages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iune</hi> 21. having stay'd till the great Heat were over, we left <hi>Senkan</hi> after Sun-set, taking
our way,<note place="margin">Sulthanie.</note> by Moon-light, through a Plain of six Leagues, at the end whereof we came, with
the Sun-rising, to <hi>Sulthanie.</hi> It had been so calm and cold in the Night, that we had hardly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47786:124"/>
the use of our Limbs, so that we had much ado to alight. This sudden change, from extreme
cold, to the excessive heats of the next day, occasion'd the falling sick of fifteen persons of our
retinue at the same time, all of a violent burning Feaver, the fits whereof were very frequent,
accompany'd with a benumd'ness of all the Members: but that misfortune hindred not but that
they were set on horse-back, and though to avoid the heats of the day, we afterwards travel'd
only by night, yet were they so far from over-mastering their former weariness, that they
were brought lower and lower. Two of our Guards took occasion to fall out at this place, and
fought a Duel, wherein one of the two, who was a Scotch-man, named <hi>Thomas Craig,</hi> was
run into the Lights, near the Heart, of which VVound he lay long sick, but at last was
Cur'd.</p>
                     <p>As to the City of <hi>Sulthanie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Its situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it lies at eighty four degrees, five minutes Longitude, and at
thirty six degrees, thirty minutes Latitude, in a spacious Plain, which is not, as Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi>
writes, encompass'd of all sides with a great Mountain; but it hath indeed on both
sides, especially on the right hand, the Mountain of <hi>Keidar.</hi> It makes a great shew at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
by reason of some very sumptuous structures, and a great number of steeples, and great
Pillars, which dazle the eye on the out-side; but within it is in a manner desolate, and when
a man comes near it, he finds the Walls almost even with the ground. It was heretofore one of
the greatest, and noblest Cities of all <hi>Persia,</hi> being above half a League in length, as may be
yet seen by the marks upon the way of <hi>Hamedan,</hi> half a League or better from the City, in a
gate which hath belonging to it,<note place="margin">Built by <hi>Choda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bende.</hi>
                        </note> and a Tower, which some affirm was heretofore part of the
City Walls. <hi>Sulthan Mahomet Chodabende,</hi> having joyn'd to his other Territories some part
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> as also of the <hi>Vsbeques,</hi> and <hi>Turky,</hi> built it out of the ruins of the antient City
of <hi>Tigranocerta,</hi> and made it the seat of his Empire, from whom it derives the name of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thania:</hi>
inasmuch as heretofore, the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> were not called <hi>Schachs,</hi> as they are now,
but they assum'd the quality of <hi>Sulthan,</hi> as the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> does. <hi>Chotza Reschid,</hi> King of
<hi>Persia,</hi> whom <hi>Ios. Barbarus</hi> calls <hi>Giansam,</hi> destroy'd some part of the City of <hi>Sulthania,</hi> upon
a Rebellion of the Inhabitants, and what he had left, <hi>Tamberlane</hi> made an end of. We saw
there the ruins of a very fair Castle, which had serv'd the King for a Palace, and the City for
a Cittadel, there being yet standing some part of its Walls, all built of square pieces of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
and adorn'd with a great number of quadrangular Towers. The noblest buildings in it,
or <hi>Emerat,</hi> is the <hi>Metzid</hi> or <hi>Mosquey,</hi> where is to be seen the Sepulchre of <hi>Mahumed Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabende.</hi>
It hath three gates, very much higher than those of St. <hi>Marks</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> and

                     <p>The greatest of the three gates, which is over against the <hi>Meydan,</hi> or Market-place,
would not open, as they affirm, even though twenty of the strongest men could be chosen
should endeavour all they could to thrust it open, if they do not pronounce these words, <hi>Beask

hindges, with so much ease, that, no Child but may open it. The whole roof which grows
narrower and narrower up towards the top, is built with white and blew stones, which, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places, have very fair Characters, and excellent Figures done upon them. One part of
the structure was divided from the other by a brass Grate or Rail, for the Sepulchre of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
Chudabende,</hi> making a kind of Quire, where we saw several old <hi>Arabick</hi> Books, above
half an Ell square, having Letters as long as a man's finger, and black and golden Lines alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately.

or <hi>Candle of the Heart,</hi> and begins with a Fable, the relation whereof the Reader may
haply think worth his reading. He says then, that God banish'd the Devils, and had shut Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Gate upon them, yet had they still a desire to know what the Angels did, and what they
said of the good or ill fortunes of men, that they might give them notice thereof, by the means
of Fortune-tellers and Sorcerers. To dive into these secrets, they thought the only way was
to get up on one anothers shoulders, till such time as the last could put his Ear to Heaven Gate.
God perceiving their temerarious attempt, darted on the head of the foremost of them a Star,
which is called in Arabick <hi>Schihab,</hi> which striking through all the Devils immediately reduc'd
them to ashes: But that this judgement hinders not, but that sometimes the Devils make use of
the same means, to endeavour to dive into the secrets of Paradice, though they are often pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
for it. Thence is it, that when the <hi>Persians</hi> see one of those Meteors, which to our

The Sepulchre of <hi>Sulthan Mahomed Chodabende</hi> is to be seen through a grate of admirable
workmanship, at the end of the Temple, on that side where the <hi>Meherab</hi> or Altar, stands.
This grate is certainly one of the noblest things that are to be seen all over <hi>Persia,</hi> being made
of <hi>Indian</hi> Steel, polish'd and wrought Damask-wise, the Barrs being about the bigness of a
mans arm, and so neatly wrought that the Junctures are hardly discernable. Nay some affirm
it is all of a piece, and that there were seven years spent in the doing of it, at the end whereof
<hi>Chodabende</hi> had it transported from the <hi>Indies,</hi> together with the Gates of the <hi>Mosquey,</hi> to the
place where they are now to be seen.</p>
                     <p>There were in the same <hi>Emerat,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Artillery.</note> twenty brass Guns and a Mortar-piece, and among the rest,
four pieces of Battery, the others Culverings, all set upon carriages with four wheels. The
Mortar-piece was mark'd with a spread Eagle, above which were these two Letters A. and Z.
and under it an A. The Balls were of Marble. The Tower was built in the form of an Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,
and compass'd about with a great Gallery, which had eight little Towers, up to which
there was an ascent by eight low steps. At the entrance of the <hi>Mosquey</hi> there was a square
Fountain, into which the water was brought from a Spring rising out of the Mountain <hi>Keider.</hi>
There is also belonging to it a very fair Garden, and a Summe-house.</p>
                     <p>There is in the same City another fair <hi>Mosquey,</hi> founded by <hi>Schach Ismael,</hi> the first of that
name. The entrance into it is through a very fair and large Gate, over which there is a round
Tower: and the first thing offers it self to your view is a noble Pyramid, somewhat decay'd at
the top, having about it eight fair Pillars of Marble. Then is it that you come into the <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey</hi>
it self, which is very high and well arched, having a great number of Pillars which
up-hold the Roof, with pleasant Galleries, and in the midst a rich Pulpit. This also hath
a fair Garden belonging to it, in the midst whereof there is a Tower, whose point ends in a
Pyramid.</p>
                     <p>These structures do in some measure oblige us to credit what <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi> sayes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> had a respect for the <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queys.</hi>
                        </note> in the 14.
Book of his History; as also what <hi>F. Perodin</hi> confirms, in the Life of <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> to wit, that
that barbarous Commander, who over-ran all that lay in his way like a Torrent, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
a certain respect for those things, which were, though out of superstition, accompted
sacred.</p>
                     <p>Near this <hi>Mosquey</hi> there is also to be seen another great Gate, of free-stone, between two
Pillars, twenty fathom high, which seems to be antique, and had been built at the Ceremonies
of some Triumph; but it begins now to decay.</p>
                     <p>The City hath about six thousand Inhabitants, who wondred very much to hear us relate,
that some of those who have published their Travels into <hi>Persia,</hi> would make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the cold weather forc'd them in the Winter time to forsake the City, and change
their Habitations. For, it is so far from being true, that there are many places in <hi>Persia,</hi> where
the cold obliges the Inhabitants to change their Habitations, that, on the contrary, it is an effect
ordinarily caus'd there by the Heat.</p>
                     <p>True indeed it is, that there are some places in that Kingdome, where the cold is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious,
by reason of the scarcity of firing, as for instance, near <hi>Eruan,</hi> at a place called
<hi>Deralekes,</hi> as being seated between two Mountains, and especially at the Village of <hi>Arpa.</hi> But
it is not so great as to oblige the Inhabitants to change their Habitations: for they only quit
their upper Rooms, and retire into Cellars, built very deep under ground, not only to serve
them for a place of retirement in the Winter time, against the cold, but also in Summer, against
the heat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iune</hi> 25. we left <hi>Sulthanie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Women travel in great Chests</note> after we had staid there three dayes, which were spent up and
down the Country, in getting us fresh Horses and Camels. The sick persons, who by reason
of their weakness, were not able to ride on Horse-back, were dispos'd into such Chests, as the
Women make use of when they travel. The <hi>Persians</hi> call them <hi>Ketzawhea,</hi> and they are put
on Camels backs, like Carriers packs. The Physician and my self were set upon the same Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,
whereby we were put to two great inconveniences, one proceeding from the violent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
caus'd by the going of that great Beast, which at every step, gave us a furious jolt; and
the other, from the insupportable stink of the Camels, whereof there being but one Boy to guide
eight or ten, they were ty'd one to another, and went all in a file, insomuch that the infectious
smell of all that went before, came full into our Noses.</p>
                     <p>We departed two hours before Sun-rising, and travell'd that day six Leagues, through a very

About noon we took up our Lodging at the Village of <hi>Choramdah,</hi> which lies on the side of a

is given it, which signifies, a <hi>place of Pleasure.</hi>

                     <p>The 26. we departed thence in the night, and travell'd five Leagues or better, over Mountains

                     <p>The 27. we departed at mid-night, and, having travell'd five Leagues, we were got, by Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising,

near the City of <hi>Casuin,</hi> or <hi>Cashan;</hi> but that the <hi>Daruga,</hi> who had the Command of it,
might have the leisure to set his affairs in order for our entrance, our <hi>Mehemander</hi> carried us to
a Village were we staid above two hours till such time as the <hi>Daruga</hi> came to receive us. This
entrance was not accompany'd with the same Ceremonies as we had seen in other places, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Governour, having not the dignity of <hi>Chan,</hi> could not express the same Magnificence.
Yet was it handsom enough, in as much as the <hi>Daruga</hi> came attended by five or six hundred men,
horse and foot. There came also to meet us an <hi>Indian</hi> Prince, accompany'd by some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
on horse-back of his own Countrey, and follow'd by a great number of Lacqueys and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
He came in a kind of Chariot, having one other person with him in it. The Chariot was
drawn by two white Oxen, which had very short necks, and a bunch between the two shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but they were as swift and manageable as our horses. The Chariot was cover'd above,
and lay'd over two Wheels, which instead of an Axletree, turn'd upon a piece of Iron, made
so crook'd at the middle, that it bore the weight of the whole Chariot. The Charioteer sate
before, and guided the Oxen, fasten'd to a Beam, which was made fast to the Horns, with a
Cord drawn through their Nostrils.</p>
                     <p>Being come within 500. paces of the City, we met with fifteen young Ladies, excellently
well mounted, very richly clad in Cloath of Gold and Silver, &amp;c. having Neck-laces of great
Pearls about their necks, Pendants in their ears, and abundance of other Jewels. Their faces
were to be seen, contrary to the custom of honest Women in <hi>Persia.</hi> Accordingly, we soon
found, as well by their confident carriage, as the accompt given us of them, that they were
some of the Eminent Curtezans about the City, who came to entertain us with the Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Musick. They march'd before us, and sung, to the sound of certain Hawboyes,
and Bag-pipes, that went before them, making a very extravagant kind of Harmony. And
that we might be sure to see the City, we were carried quite through it, and Lodg'd on the
other side thereof.</p>
                     <p>As we pass'd through the <hi>Meydan,</hi> we saw several persons playing on Timbrels, and Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes,
who, joyning with the other <hi>Musicians,</hi> accompany'd us to our Quarters. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

it is seated in a great sandy Plain, having, within half a dayes journey of it, Westward, the
great Mountain of <hi>Elwend,</hi> which reaches towards the South-west, as far as <hi>Bagdat</hi> or <hi>Babylon.</hi>
The City is a <hi>farsang,</hi> or good <hi>German</hi> league in compass, but hath neither Walls, nor any
Garrison kept in it,<note place="margin">Hath above 100000. Inhabistants.</note> by reason it lies at so great a distance from the Frontiers. Yet hath it, with
these disadvantages, above a hundred thousand Inhabitants, whereof, if there were occasion
for them, a good part might be put into Arms. Their Language is the <hi>Persian,</hi> but somewhat
different from the common Dialect,<note place="margin">Its Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note> whence it comes that it is not so intelligible to the other
<hi>Persians,</hi> being much after the rate that the <hi>German</hi> Language is to the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> The hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are all of Brick bak'd in the Sun, according to the <hi>Persian</hi> way, having not any Ornament
without, but within, they are very well furnish'd, as to Vaults, Wainscoats, Paintings, and other
Houshold-stuff.</p>
                     <p>The Streets are not pav'd, whence it comes, that, upon the least wind, the City is fill'd with
dust. It hath no other water than what is brought by aqueducts from the Mountain of <hi>Elwend,</hi>
into Cesterns, wherein it is preserv'd. No house almost but hath a particular place for the
keeping of Ice and Snow, for the Summer. VVe were forc'd to get into these, to avoid the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive

                        </note> the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> had their ordinary residence at this place, at least, ever after
<hi>Schach-Tamas</hi> transferr'd the Seat of the Empire from <hi>Tauris</hi> to this City. Some attribute that
translation to <hi>Schach-Ismael,</hi> though the continual VVars he was engag'd in, suffered him not
to stay long in any one place. But it is not question'd but that he built the noble Palace which
stands near the <hi>Maidan,</hi> which hath belonging to it a fair Garden, adorn'd as well without as
within, with Guilding, Painting, and such other embellishments as are in use among the
<hi>Persians.</hi>

                     <p>There was another Garden opposite to this Palace,<note place="margin">Its Palace.</note> which was above half a league in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
and had several little Structures within it. This was one of the most pleasant Gardens
that I ever saw, not only by reason of the great number of all sorts of Trees, as Apples, Pears,
Peaches, Apricocks, Pomegranates, Almonds, and other Fruit-trees, but also by reason of
the fair walks of Cypress, and the Trees called <hi>Tzinnar</hi> which gave us a very pleasant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>

This City hath two great Market-places. <hi>Cartwright</hi> names the bigger of the two <hi>Atmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
and says, that, in the <hi>Persian</hi> Language, it signifies a <hi>Horse-market.</hi> I could never find,
that in any part of <hi>Persia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Markets.</note> there was a Market, purposely for the buying and selling of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
whereupon, considering with my self that the <hi>Persians,</hi> who call, by the general name of
<hi>Maidan,</hi> all those Markets, where all things are indifferently sold, I imagine, that Author's
mistake proceeded hence, that, being ignorant of the <hi>Arabick,</hi> he read <hi>Atmaydan,</hi> for <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maidan,
al,</hi> being the Article, without which the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Arabiaas</hi> never pronounce the
word <hi>Maidan.</hi> The greater of these <hi>Maidans,</hi> or Market-places, is somewhat longer, but
not so broad as that of <hi>Ardebil,</hi> and hath, on the South-side, several great places, built by
some of the <hi>Chans</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Lords. The most magnificent amongst them are those of <hi>Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werdi-Chan,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Schiras;</hi> that of <hi>Aliculi-Chan,</hi> President of Justice; that of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet-Chan,
Chan,</hi> or Governour of <hi>Kentze;</hi> and that of <hi>Sehich-Achmed-Chan,</hi> who was
great Provest in the reign of <hi>Schach-Abas.</hi> The other Market-place is called <hi>Senke-Maidan,</hi>
and is towards the West part of the City. In both the Market-places, as also in the <hi>Bazars,</hi>
or Shops and Store-houses, which are in the cover'd streets, there may be seen a great number
of Merchants, and abundance of Commodities, which are to be bought there at a very reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
rate.</p>
                     <p>I my self bought Turqueses there, which they call <hi>Firuse,</hi> and are found in great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

                     <p>In the Evening, after the shops are shut, there is, on the East-side, another kind of Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
exposed to sale, to wit, a considerable number of the <hi>Cabbeha,</hi> or common Traders, who
there prostitute themselves to any that will take them up. They all sit in a row, having their
faces cover'd with a Veil, and behind them there stands a Bawd, whom they call <hi>Delal,</hi> who
hath by her a bed, and a quilted coverlet, and holds in her hand a Candle unlighted, which,
when any Customer comes, she presently lights, that he may look the Wench in the face, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

and a great number of publick Baths. There is one behind the Garden belonging to the
King's Palace, which they call <hi>Haman Charabe.</hi> It is now half destroy'd, and there is a story
told of it, which I conceive pleasant enough to deserve insertion into this Relation. They say,
that there lived heretofore at <hi>Caswin</hi> a very famous Physician,<note place="margin">The fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous story of <hi>Lok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
                        </note> named <hi>Lokman,</hi> a black <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian,</hi>
who had acquired so great reputation, not only by the Books he had written in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
but also by many other excellent productions of his understanding, that the Inhabitants
have still a very great Veneration for his memory. Nay it is to be found in their <hi>Kulusthan,</hi> that
they gave him the surname of <hi>Wise,</hi> when in the 2. Book, ch. 16. they say, <hi>Lokman hakimra
kuftendi Aedebeski amuchti? Kust, es biedbahn. Herstze ischan kerdend, men pertis Kerdem.</hi>
That is, <hi>that the wise</hi> Lokman, <hi>being asked one day by what means he had attain'd so great Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Knowledge, he made answer, it was by means of the ignorant and uncivil, for he had
always done what was contrary to what he had seen them do.</hi> This <hi>Lokman</hi> having attain'd a great
age, and being upon his death-bed, sent for his Son, and told him, that he would leave him
an inestimable Treasure, and having commanded to be brought him three Glasses, full of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Medicinal waters, he said they had the vertue to raise up a Dead man to Life, if they
were apply'd before the body began to corrupt. That, casting upon the Deceas'd the water
which was in the first Glass, the Soul would return into the Body, that, upon the pouring of
the second, the Body would stand upright; and that upon the third, the Person would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
alive, and should do all things as before; that however he had very seldome made use
of this Experiment, out of a fear of committing a sin, by undertaking to intermeddle with
that which is reserv'd to God alone; and that out of the same Consideration, he exhorted him
to be very careful how he made use of it, as being a secret rather to be admir'd, than put often
to experience. With these exhortations <hi>Lokman</hi> dying, his Son was very mindful of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he had given him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>cending the same tenderness of Conscience as his Father had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
before him, he reserv'd the Glasses till he might have occasion to make tryal of them
upon himself. Accordingly being at the point of Death, he commanded a man that waited on
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47786:126"/>
him, to make use of those Glasses, as his Father had taught him. The man having caus'd his
Master's Body to be brought into the Bath we spoke of before, poured upon it the two first
Glasses, which wrought the effect, which <hi>Lokman</hi> had promised they should; insomuch that
the Master sitting up, and impatient to return to Life, cries out, <hi>bris, bris,</hi> that is to say, <hi>pour,
pour;</hi> at which words the fellow was so frightned, that he let the third Glass fall down to the
ground; so that the unfortunate <hi>Lokman Sade</hi> was forc'd to lye down again, and take the
Journey which all other Mortals do. The <hi>Persians</hi> confidently affirm, that, near this ruinous
Bath, that Voice af <hi>bris, bris,</hi> is still many times heard. They relate several other stories of this
<hi>Lokman,</hi> but I shall forbear any account of them, thinking it enough to have produced one, to
shew the vanity of all the rest.</p>
                     <p>Some years since, in the time of King <hi>Abas,</hi> a certain man named <hi>Risa,</hi> began to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the quality of <hi>Schich,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Risa</hi> a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</note> or Prophet, and to broach a new Doctrine, imagining he might
in time, acquire the same credit and authority, as had before rais'd <hi>Schich-Sefi</hi> to so great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
The humour of the <hi>Persians,</hi> who are extremely addicted to novelty, brought after
him, in a short time, above thirty thousand men, who, cajoll'd by the apparent sanctity of this
new Prophet, were become followers of him. <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> fearing this novelty might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
the quiet of his Country, sent for <hi>Risa,</hi> making him believe, that he was desirous to be
instructed in the particulars of his Doctrine: but when he was come, the King commanded
him to confirm it by miracles, which <hi>Risa</hi> not able to do, he put him to death as an
Impostor.</p>
                     <p>It will not be amiss here to give some accompt how the <hi>Indian</hi> Prince came to live at <hi>Caswin,</hi>

                        </note>
when we came into those parts. The great <hi>Mogul,</hi> who liv'd in the time of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> left,
at his Death, two Sons: The elder, who succeeded the Father, soon after died, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him only that <hi>Myrsa Polagi,</hi> whom we found at <hi>Caswin,</hi> who was but very young
when his Father died. <hi>Choram,</hi> youngest Son of that <hi>Mogul,</hi> and Uncle to young <hi>Polagi,</hi>
took his advantage of that Conjuncture, to usurp the Crown, and accordingly he was King of
<hi>Indosthan</hi> at the time of our Travels into <hi>Persia.</hi> The cruelty of <hi>Choram</hi>'s reign, and the mild
nature and inclinations of <hi>Polagi,</hi> who in the mean time was arriv'd to a considerable age, drew
upon him the affections of the People, and the hatred of his Uncle. In so much, that <hi>Choram,</hi>
perceiving that it was the design of the <hi>Indians</hi> to bring his Nephew into the Throne, would
prevent them, by dispatching <hi>Polagi</hi> out of the way, who having notice of his Uncles wicked
intentions against him, retires into <hi>Persia,</hi> and puts himself under the <hi>Schach</hi>'s Protection.
All the time before, his Residence had been at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where the King allow'd him a pension
of 12000 Crowns <hi>per an.</hi> but he was oblig'd then to retire to <hi>Caswin,</hi> by reason of a solemn
Embassy, which the <hi>Mogul</hi> sent to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> purposely to demand him; though that
during the space of three years that the said Ambassador had been there, he had not prevail'd to
have him delivered up.</p>
                     <p>The Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> live in perpetual jealousie of the <hi>Indians,</hi> with whom they never have
any assured peace, by reason of the Frontiers of <hi>Candahar,</hi> which finds Exercise for both sides,
as those of <hi>Babylon</hi> do on the <hi>Turks</hi> side: insomuch that the <hi>Persians</hi> take their advantage of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
occasion, to foment the discontents of the Grandees, as they do any other distractions tending
to Civil War. Whence it comes, that they never deny their Protection to the <hi>Indian</hi> Princes,
who are willing to retire into <hi>Persia,</hi> to oblige by that means the <hi>Mogul</hi> to assist them against
the <hi>Turk,</hi> and to continue the Commerce, which the <hi>Persians</hi> have with the <hi>Indians,</hi> from
which <hi>Persia</hi> derives so great advantages, that the obstruction thereof would be an infinite loss
to it. There are several instances of these Protections under <hi>Schach-Ismael,</hi> and <hi>Schach-Tamas.</hi>
Under the reign of the latter it happened, that <hi>Selim,</hi> who, as eldest of the House, had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
his Father, died soon after, leaving only one Son, very young, named <hi>Humajun. Tze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laledin
Ekber,</hi> younger Brother to the Deceas'd, who slighting the infancy of his Nephew,
takes possession of the Scepter, and the more to assure himself thereof, he had a design to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the right heir of the Crown. <hi>Humajun</hi> had notice of it, and got to <hi>Persia. Tzelaledin</hi>
hearing of it, sent to demand him, with this message to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> that if he sent him
not back, he would come and fetch him away with all the forces of his Kingdom. <hi>Schach-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
who was then engag'd in an open War against the <hi>Turks,</hi> not thinking it prudence to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
so powerful an Enemy,<note place="margin">Schach-Tamas's <hi>evasion.</hi>
                        </note> caus'd <hi>Humajun</hi> to be hidden, and that he might not make a
false Oath, when he was to give an answer to the Embassy of <hi>Tzelaledin,</hi> he put him into a
Cage, and caus'd that to be hung in a Tree, while he was to give Audience to the Ambassador,
to whom he protested, that, <hi>Humajun nist der chakimen;</hi> Humajun <hi>is not upon my Lands,</hi> and
dismiss'd the Ambassador with that answer. But having, afterwards, made a Peace with the
<hi>Turk,</hi> he sent <hi>Humajun</hi> with a powerful Army, commanded by <hi>Mehediculi Sulthan,</hi> against
<hi>Tzelaledin,</hi> who was so startled to find himself set upon by so strong an Enemy, that he
was forc'd to run away. <hi>Humajun</hi> desirous to requite the services of <hi>Mehediculi,</hi> bestow'd on
him Lordships and great wealth in the Province of <hi>Kulkende,</hi> where he settled himself, with the
consent of <hi>Schach-Tamas,</hi> and where his Posterity still live in much credit and authority.</p>

The Ambassadors sent some of the retinue to visit the Prince <hi>Polagi,</hi> who receiv'd them, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

Servants and Domesticks. He took this for so great a civility and kindness from the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
that he thought it not enough to express how sensible he was thereof in words, but would
needs treat those that had been sent to him with a Collation of Wine and Fruits, and told them,
that being not in a condition to entertain them, as he wish'd, out of his own Estate, he was
forc'd to borrow of the Kings favours to make them that treatment. The Ambassadors intended to
have given him a personal visit, but the <hi>Persians</hi> would by no means permit it, alleging it was
against the custom of the Country; where Ambassadors are not permitted to make any Visits
before they have had audience of the King.</p>

he had caused Tents to be pitch'd, to keep off the heat of the Sun, and some part of it to be
sprinkled with water, to avoid the inconvenience of the dust. Having dispos'd the people into a
ring all about the place, and seated the Ambassadors on high seats, there came in, first, certain
persons who were excellent at Vaulting and shewing feats of Activity. After them came in three
pair of Wrastlers, most naked, having nothing cover'd about them, but what nature would
have to be so. Only two among them had Leathern drawers on, done over with Oyl, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
a miraculous activity and strength of Body. After these had shewn all could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from persons of their quality, there were brought in two Rams, which run very furiously
one at the other; as also two Birds, somewhat bigger than Parrots, which fought with great
animosity. After these, there came in, with the noise of Timbrels, eight Wolves of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
bigness, fasten'd to long Ropes, which they let out five or six times one after another
among the people, but drew them back ere they did any hurt. And at last came in a man cover'd
with a thick Mattress, who went boldly to one of the Wolves, took him up by the Body, and
carried him away.</p>
                     <p>The Prince <hi>Polagi</hi> would have given us the Divertisement of his Elephant, which he sent for
to be brought thither; but he being then at Grass, it was so long ere they could bring him,
that the Ambassadors, who were already weary of a Divertisement, which had lasted but too
long, and found themselves prejudic'd by the heat, went home to their Quarters. Some dayes
afterwards,<note place="margin">Elephant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

astonish'd at his monstrous bulk, which exceeded the height of any two men, as being indeed
without comparison much bigger than any of those we afterwards saw at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where there
was a great number of them. His leggs were bigger than any man about the waste, and his
ears came down along his head, half an ell in length, or better. He could do many tricks, and
was govern'd by a little Boy, who by touching him in the fore-head with a little pole-axe, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sharp at the point, guided him, and made him lye down and rise up as he pleas'd. Whence
may be corrected the Errour of the antients,<note place="margin">An error of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</note> who were of opinion, that the Elephant could not

which, were it true, would be very remarkable; but admitting it is not, we shall nevertheless
insert it here, as we have it from them, upon occasion of this Mountain.</p>
                     <p>They say then,<note place="margin">A pleasant story.</note> that, heretofore, a certain King of <hi>Persia</hi> named <hi>Suhak Maran,</hi> who was
much pleas'd in taking journeys up and down, would needs once find out some means to have
made in the open fields, some <hi>Iauchas,</hi> which is a kind of baked paste, used by the <hi>Persians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Napkins. The Devil, desirous to make his advantage of this irregular desire of the
Kings, presented himself to him in the shape of a man, made him an Oven, which a Camel
might easily carry, and desir'd of him no other reward, than that he might kiss the King's
shoulder. There was no difficulty made to grant him a thing of so little consequence; but the
Devil, instead of kissing the King's shoulder, apply'd his teeth thereto, takes away a piece of
it, and immediately vanishes. Out of the wound, there came two Serpents, which were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
biting at the head and ears of that miserable Prince, to get out his brains; and though
they were often cut off, yet there immediately starrted up others in their room. The Devil, who
had done all the mischief, having disguis'd himself like a <hi>Hakim,</hi> or Physician, went and made
proffer of his service at the Court, and prescrib'd a remedy, which was as bad, if not worse,
than the evil it self. He said, that since those Serpents were so desirous to feed on the brains of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47786:127"/>
a man, and that, as it should seem, it was their only sustenance, the best course were, every
day, to kill two men, and to feed them with their brains. One of the chiefest Grandees about
the Court, moved with compassion, to see daily so much innocent Blood spilt, and considering,
that by the means of so many murthers, the number of the King's Subjects would be infinitely
diminish'd, ordered that there should be two men brought to the Stake, as they were wont be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but that only one should be kill'd, and that with the mans brains, those of a Sheep, then
also new kill'd, should be mixt, and that that should be the allowance of the Serpents. Which
project took so successfully, that the said Lord perceiving, that the Serpents were not sensible
thereof, he, at last, caus'd the two men to be convey'd out of the way, and made use only of
sheeps brain. Among those who had most contributed to the nourishment of these Beasts, a
Black-Smith, named <hi>Churdek,</hi> was one, by which means almost all his Children had been upon
that accompt destroy'd; so that, of seventy six Sons, that he had had, only two were left.
Growing desperate upon so great a loss, he represented to the other Inhabitants of the City,
that it was impossible for them to endure that Tyranny long; that there was no likelyhood
nature should have brought them all into the world, to be sacrifiz'd to the appetite of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
man; that it were better to rid themselves of the Tyrant, and in regard the State could
not be without a Governour, that it was his advice, they should bring in <hi>Kechosrow ben Fridun,</hi>
who had been put out by <hi>Suhak,</hi> and was then Living, in the Deserts of the Mountain of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wend.</hi>
This Counsell was approv'd by the people, who desirous to have it put in Execution by
the person who had given it, entrusted the Black-Smith with the management of that great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
who, having fasten'd his Leathern apron to an Iron hook, led on the rest of the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
and seiz'd the Person of <hi>Suhak.</hi> They went afterwards to the Mountain of <hi>Elwend,</hi>
where they found <hi>Kechosrow</hi> among the wild Beasts, and restor'd him to his Throne. The first
request that <hi>Kechosrow</hi> made to the people was, that <hi>Suhak</hi> might not be put to death; which
was granted, but they carried him to the Mountain of <hi>Demawend,</hi> which reaches from that of
<hi>Elwend,</hi> towards <hi>Teheran,</hi> where they made him go into a Cave, and hung him up by the feet.
They say, he is there Living to this day, and that the place of his punishment is known by a
sulphureous stink that comes out of it. Whereto they add, that when a stone is cast into the
Cave, there comes out a voice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which sayes <hi>Tzira miseni mera?</hi> that is, <hi>Why dost thou fling
stones at me?</hi> They say also, that <hi>Kechosrow</hi> so regulated his expences, during the whole time
of his Reign, that he gather'd vast Treasures together, and that he put it up in the Mountain
<hi>Bakru</hi> in the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> hiding it so safely, by the means of a <hi>Thelesmat</hi> or <hi>Talisman,</hi> that,
till there happen a Conjuncture of the same Stars, it will never be discover'd. They say the
place is known, but that when any come near it, there arise certain winds, which not only
blow out the lights, but also overturn the men who bring them.</p>
                     <p>But the truth of all this story, is, that there are many Sulphureous Mines in those Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and that the winds, which reign there, are very natural, and ordinary, as well there as
in several other Provinces of <hi>Persia;</hi> as we had observ'd before at <hi>Ardebil.</hi> Nor is it unlikely
that there may be a mystical sense of this relation, and that the <hi>Persians,</hi> who are much addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to teach their Morality under Fables, would, by this fabulous History; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>demn those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who, to satisfie their irregular passions, are apt to hear flatterers, who being ever guilty
of wicked intentions, never give any good advice, and, to prevent the inconveniences arising
thereby, apply remedies that are much more dangerous than the evil it self, and such as not
only are destructive to the people, but also putting them into despair, animate them into rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against their Princes, who are, by that means, brought to great misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iuly</hi> 13. we left <hi>Caswin;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors leave <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win.</hi>
                        </note> the sick persons and the Baggage were sent away in the evening,
the Ambassadors follow'd the same night. The next day, the 14. having travell'd through a
Plain of three Leagues, we came to the Village of <hi>Membre,</hi> whereof all the Houses were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
like Vaults, so that looking on it at a distance, the whole Village seem'd to consist of so
many Ovens. The Ambassador <hi>Crusius,</hi> the principal person of the Embassy, began, at this
place, to complain of some indisposition: insomuch that, not being able any longer to ride on
Horse-back, he was for some dayes following carried in a Litter. Our Minister was grown so
weak, that, not able to endure the jolting of the Horse, he alighted ever and anon, and lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ground, thinking by that means to get some ease. Monsieur <hi>Mandelslo</hi> was the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who had no touch of any sickness all along our Travels; whence it came, that he had the
more convenience of observing all the particulars thereof; which he hath done with so much
exactness, that his Notes might make a considerable Volume.</p>
                     <p>We travell'd that night seven Leagues, and were got the next day, being the 15. very betimes
in the morning, to a fair Village, named <hi>Araseng.</hi> We found there, in a Garden which was
seated on the right side of a Torrent, good store of Pomegranates and Almonds, which were a
great refreshment to us. In the evening, we prosecuted our travels, and got six Leagues further,
over a very smooth Mountain, and Lodg'd the 16. in the morning, at a <hi>Caravanscra,</hi> named
<hi>Choskeru.</hi> It was all built of Free-stone, and had several Vaults and Chambers, dispos'd all about
a spacious Court, in the midst whereof there was a Well, compass'd by an Iron-rail. Upon
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47786:127"/>
the Walls of several Rooms, were to be seen the names and devises of several persons of most
Nations, who, it seems, had been desirous to leave there behind them some marks of their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
that way. We departed thence about four in the afternoon, and travell'd, that night, nine
leagues.</p>
                     <p>The 17, we came betimes in the morning, in sight of <hi>Saba,</hi> but in regard the Sun was not
yet up, we made a halt at some distance from the City, to give them time to come out and
receive us.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> put this City at 85 degrees Longitude,<note place="margin">The situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Saba,</hi>
                        </note> and 35 Latitude; but I found it at 34
degrees, 56 minutes. It is seated in a spacious Plain, within sight of the Mountain of <hi>Elwende,</hi>
which may be discover'd thence, by reason of its height, which reaches in a manner to the
Clouds. The ruins of the City of <hi>Rhei</hi> are under the same parallel with that of <hi>Saba,</hi> from
which it is a good days journey distant, towards the East. The ground thereabouts is of a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
colour, and brings forth neither grass nor fruit.</p>
                     <p>The cause of that barrenness they attribute to the Malediction, which was pronounc'd against
it, upon the account of <hi>Omar Saad,</hi> who was one of the principal Military Commanders, in
the time of <hi>Hossein.</hi> This <hi>Omar,</hi> who had, at first, profess'd friendship to <hi>Hossein,</hi> prov'd the
only person who would serve <hi>Iesid Peser</hi> against him; upon this score, that <hi>Hossein,</hi> being
of the blood of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and having acquir'd a great reputation of Sanctity, not one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>Medina</hi> would take up Arms against him, but only this <hi>Omar,</hi> who engag'd in a war
against him, upon promise, that there should be bestow'd on him the City of <hi>Rhei,</hi> with the
Territories belonging thereto, which, long before, he had been very desirous of. But the death of
<hi>Hossein,</hi> who was kill'd in that VVar, brought upon the Countrey, the Curse,
which, according to their saying, is still visible there, in the colour and barrenness of
the ground.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Saba</hi> is of no great bigness,<note place="margin">Excellent fruits at <hi>Saba.</hi>
                        </note> though it be numbred among those, which make
a fair shew on the out-side, by reason of its Towers, and other publick structures. The Walls
of it are but of earth, and its houses in a manner all destroy'd: but it hath, in requital, very
fair Gardens, and rare and excellent Fruits, especially Pomegranates, and Almonds. Near the
City, at the foot of the Mountain, there grows abundance of Cotton and Rice, which are the
greatest Commodities they have to Trade in. We stay'd there only that one day, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thence in the evening, travelling the night following six Leagues or better, so that, the 18.
by Sun-rising, we were got to a <hi>Caravansera,</hi> called <hi>Schach Ferabath.</hi> The heat was so excessive
that day, that though we were all in our Drawers, yet could we not possibly avoid the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
thereof.</p>
                     <p>We ordered our Tents to be pitch'd abroad,<note place="margin">Excessive heats.</note> so to have the advantage of the coolness, and
the wind, which came from the adjoyning Mountain; but, about noon, the Sun so heated the
Wind it self, that the hot blasts which come out of an Oven could not be hotter; insomuch
that we were forc'd to retire into the <hi>Caravansera,</hi> where the heat was somewhat more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
Nay, the ground it self, which, in those parts, is only Sand and Heath, was so hot, that
a man could not go five or six steps, without burning his feet. About this time, both the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
were very sick: but their indisposition giving them altternately a little ease, the
weaker of the two made use of the Litter, and the other rode on Horse-back.</p>
                     <p>The 19. we travell'd five Leagues,<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Kom.</hi>
                        </note> and got in the morning before the City of <hi>Kom.</hi> The
<hi>Daruga</hi> receiv'd us within five or six hundred paces of the City, accompany'd by fifty Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
on Horse-back, and certain Tumblers, among whom there were some, who went upon
Stilts before the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> whose chance it was that day to be alone on Horse-back,
and shew'd a thousand tricks of activity, all the way to the Ambassadors Lodgings. As we
pass'd through the Market-place, we found a great number of Timbrels, Hawboyes and Fifes,
which made a kind of Musick after their way, and their Inhabitants had water'd the streets,
which being not pav'd no more than those of <hi>Caswin</hi> and several other Cities of <hi>Persia,</hi> the dust
had otherwise troubled and annoy'd us very much.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> place this City at 85 degrees,<note place="margin">Its situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 40 minutes Longitude, and at 34 degrees, 45 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts
Latitude; but after I had made a more exact observation thereof, I found on the 20. of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> precisely at noon, that the Sun was 74 degrees, 8 minutes above the Horizon, and that
the Declination, taken upon the same Meridian, was 18 degrees, 35 minutes; so that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Pole, could be but 34 degrees 17 minutes.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Kom</hi> is very antient.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Is</hi> Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana.</note> 
                        <hi>Prolomy</hi> calls it <hi>Guriana,</hi> and heretofore it was of a great
extent, as may be seen by the ruins of its Walls, and other buildings, which are a great way
without its present compass.</p>
                     <p>It lies in a Plain, on the right hand of the Mountain of <hi>Elwend,</hi> which is discover'd at a great
distance by the whiteness of its Sand, and by the extraordinary height of its points. In this
Mountain, there rises, from two several Springs, a little River, which making but one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
at the entrance of the City, runs through some part of it, and is one of the chiefest conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
belonging thereto: but about three years before our Travels that way, the little River,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47786:128"/>
over-flowing by reason of the Snow, which the precedent heat of the Spring had melted, broke
down and carried away above a thousand Houses.</p>
                     <p>There are in the Gardens,<note place="margin">Its fruits.</note> whereof there is a great number, as well within as without the
City, all sorts of excellent fruits; among others, a kind of Melons, which they call <hi>Scamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi>
much about the bigness of an Orenge. There are upon the rind spots of several colours,
and they have an admirable scent: but they are more lushious in taste than the other Melons,
which in sweetness exceed all those I ever cat any where else.</p>
                     <p>There are also some of these Melons at <hi>Ardebil,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Melons.</note> where, by reason of their scent, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
carry them in their hands; but they told us, that they were brought from the Village
of <hi>Alaru,</hi> where there grows abundance of them. The learned <hi>Golius,</hi> Professor of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riental
Languages in the University of <hi>Leyden,</hi> gives a large account of them in his <hi>Arabick
Lexicon,</hi> pag. 1309. There is also in the same place a kind of Cowcumbers of extraordinary
largeness, being above two foot long, and as thick as a mans Arm, which they call <hi>Chunchiar</hi>
that is, crooked Cowcumbers, as having the form of a bended Arm.</p>
                     <p>These the <hi>Persians</hi> pickle with Vinegar, without any Salt, but the taste of them is not very
pleasant, especially to those that are not accustomed thereto. The ground about these parts is
very fit for Tillage, and produces all sorts of Grain, as also Cotton in abundance: but the
principal Trading of the Inhabitants consists in earthen Pots,<note place="margin">Its Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</note> and Sword-blades. Those blades
which are made in this City are accounted the best in the whole Country, and are sold some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at twenty Crowns a piece. The Steel, of which they are made, comes from the City of
<hi>Niris,</hi> within four days journeys of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where there are found in the Mountain of <hi>Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wend</hi>
very rich Mines of Iron and Steel. The Pots also made in the City of <hi>Kom,</hi> are very
much esteem'd, especially the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eans, or great Pitchars; as well by reason of the excellency of
the workmanship, as for this reason, that it is conceiv'd, they will keep water fresh and sweet,
even in the greatest heats of Summer.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of this City are somewhat light-finger'd, and apt to find any thing lies in
their way.<note place="margin">The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to thesi.</note> We had hardly alighted, but our Pistols were taken away, and what was not
lock'd up immediately vanish'd. In this City some of our people began to be troubled with
bloody fluxes, occasion'd by their excessive eating of Melons and other sorts of fruits, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
water after fruit, and in the greatest heats.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iuly</hi> 21. we left <hi>Kom,</hi> an hour after Sun-set,<note place="margin">They leave <hi>Kom.</hi>
                        </note> and travell'd that night five Leagues. The
next, the 22. We stay'd in a great Village, called <hi>Kasinabath,</hi> where all the Houses of
one whole street were built so as that they made altogether but one continued Vaul., or kind
of Cloister.</p>
                     <p>The 23. we got seven Leagues, to the Village of <hi>Sensen,</hi> where we found abundance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and fruits, which the <hi>Mehemander</hi> had appointed to be brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nither from <hi>Karschan,</hi>
a place five Leagues distant thence. In this Village died one of our Interpreters for the <hi>Persian</hi>
Language, whose name was <hi>Gregory.</hi> He was by birth a <hi>Muscovite,</hi> but had been Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised;
upon which score, we left the body to those of his own Religion, to be buried after their
manner.</p>
                     <p>The 23. in the evening we departed thence, and the night following, we lost a <hi>Muscovian</hi>
servant, who dy'd of the bloody Flux by the way. We kept the Body to have it buried at
<hi>Katschan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Come to <hi>Katschan.</hi>
                        </note> with that of another <hi>Muscovian</hi> Servant, who died two hours after the former.
We got thither the 24. but so betimes in the morning, that we were forc'd to stay above two
hours, before the <hi>Daruga</hi> could come to meet us, in order to our reception. He was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
by fifty Gentlemen on Hors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with Lynxes skins; nor was the ordinary Musick of the Countrey wanting. At the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the City, he shew'd us two <hi>Indian</hi> Oxen, very black, and of great height and bulk,
which had Bells about their necks, and Plumes of Feathers in their heads, and at their Crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.<note place="margin">The <hi>Daru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement</note>
This <hi>Daruga</hi> had some time been a Foot-man to <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi> when being very young,
they were forc'd to hide him from his Grand-father <hi>Schach-Abbas;</hi> and <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi> having no
money to live upon, sold the Foot-man for fifteen <hi>Tumains,</hi> which amount to seventy five
French Pistols. But coming afterwards to the Crown, he caus'd him immediately to be
redeem'd, and, with the quality of <hi>Sulthan,</hi> bestow'd on him the Government of
<hi>Katschan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> put this City of <hi>Katschan</hi> at 84 degrees longitude, and at thirty four distant
from the Line.<note place="margin">The situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Katschan.</hi> Its bigness</note> After an exact Observation of three days, I found that it is distant from it
thirty three degrees and 51 minutes, that is, nine minutes less. The City is of a great length,
reaching from East to West, above half a <hi>German</hi> League. Its Walls and bastions are of a kind
of Potters day, and it lies in a great Plain, the ground of which is good enough for Tillage,
and there may be discover'd from it, on the right hand Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> which the <hi>'Porsians</hi> call
<hi>Elwend.</hi> As you come to the City, you pass through a place appointed for tilting and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the Ring, which hath on both sides several Pillars, and in the midst, a high Pole for
shooting at the wooden Parrat. On the left hand of that place or Carriere, you leave the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47786:128"/>
King's Garden, wherein there is one Summer-house, standing in the midst of it, and another
near it upon the High-way. We were told that the former hath a thousand Doors belonging to
it,<note place="margin">A House with a 1000. Doors.</note> comprehending in that number the Windows, through which they pass into the Galleries
and Balconies. It is to be observ'd withall, that there is no Door but hath its Counter-door, in
regard the Wall being above two foot thick, there is a Door on each side of it: so that the
number is not so great, as it seems to be at first. In this House, the King is Lodg'd, when he
comes to <hi>Katschan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The City, is no doubt, one of the most populous and most eminent for Trading of any in
<hi>Persia,</hi> and the best Built of any we were yet come to, whether in regard of its private Houses,
or its Palaces and <hi>Caravansera</hi>'s: but the <hi>Basar</hi> and <hi>Maidan,</hi> and the other publick structures,
which have all their Store-houses, Galleries, and Rooms for the Merchants, as well such as
live within the Kingdom, as Foreiners, are the noblest I met with in all my Travells into those
parts. There is, in this City, at all times, a great number of forein Merchants, and above
all, <hi>Indians,</hi> who are assigned there a particular place for their Habitation and Traffick; as
are also all the other Merchants. Tradesmen, especially such as make Silk-stuffs, and
Weavers of Gold and Silver Brocadoes, work in open places, where all the World may
see them.</p>
                     <p>The Valleys are very fruitfull in Wheat, Wine and Fruits, which grow in such abundance
there, that I find no difficulty to acknowledge, what <hi>Cartwright</hi> sayes of these parts, to wit,
that the poorest, and most indigent of the Inhabitants, have not only what is requisite for their
subsistence, but also somewhat of delicacy, and that what they most stand in need of is fresh
water. For there is not any to be had without digging very deep into the Earth, and what
there was so got we thought very distastfull to the Palat, and so corrupt, that had there not
been an extraordinary necessity, we should have been much troubled to swallow it. I must with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
confess, that I could not observe that excellent order and commendable policy, which <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi>
sayes he had seen there in the Institution of Youth, nor that they are more carefull there
than in other places, to accustom it timely to pains-taking, so to avoid idleness, and the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
consequent thereto. True it is, that the great number of Children, which are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
to be found there in Families, which by reason of Polygamy are very numerous, obliges
the Parents to be the more carefull for their subsistence; but the <hi>Persians,</hi> for the most part are
so little inclin'd to pains-taking, that, commonly, you shall either see them walking in the
<hi>Maidan,</hi> or discoursing in the Shops, while they leave most of their work to be done by their
slaves. Which happens hence, that being themselves very temperate, and content with little,
and on the other side, Provisions being very cheap, they conceive they ought not to take
much pains for what is superfluous, and those things whereof there is no great necessity.
So that there are even in these parts idle Persons, and Beggers, as well as in other places.</p>
                     <p>What the same <hi>Cartwright</hi> sayes concerning the Scorpions,<note place="margin">Venemous Creatures.</note> and other venemous Creatures,
is very true. For of these, there are, about <hi>Katschan,</hi> more than at any other place of <hi>Persia,</hi>
and such as are so dangerous, that they have occasion'd that Malediction, <hi>Akrab-Kaschan be
destet senet: may the Scorpion of Kaschan pinch thee by the hand.</hi> We found some of them in
our Lodging, as black as cole, about the length and compass of a man's finger, and we were
told, that these were the most dangerous of any sort of them.</p>
                     <p>They are somewhat like our Crabs or Crevisses, save that their Bodies are shorter, they go
faster, and they have their tails alwayes sticking up. Whence it comes that the Inhabitants ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lay their Mattresses, or Beds, upon the ground, as they do in other places; but they set
them upon a kind of Trevets, or Frames, which they call <hi>Tzarpay.</hi> They affirm also, that
these Beasts have a certain respect for strangers, and that to prevent their stinging, they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pronounce these words, <hi>Menkaribem,</hi> I am a stranger. But for my part, I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that strangers, who stand more in fear of them than the Inhabitants, are only the more
oblig'd to themselves for the care they have of their own safety; though I never could hear,
that those who are stung by them dye of it. For they have a present and easie remedy against
this kind of poison,<note place="margin">A remedy against Scorpions.</note> by applying a piece of Copper to the place affected; for which Cure they
ordinarily make use of that Money, which they call <hi>Pul,</hi> and thence it comes, that they carry
some of it alwayes about them; and having left that piece, for the space of 24. hours upon
the part stung, they take it off, and put on the Wound a Plaister made of Honey and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger.</p>
                     <p>It was my misfortune to be the only man of all our retinue that had occasion to make triall
how venemous this Creature is.<note place="margin">The Author stung by a Scorpion.</note> For lying down upon my Bed at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> in our return
from <hi>Ispahan,</hi> a Scorpion stung me in the throat, where it made immediately a swelling about
the length of my finger, which was attended with insupportable pain. As good fortune would
have it, our Physician, who lay in the same Chamber, immediately apply'd thereto the Oyl of
Scorpion, gave me some Treacle, and put me into a sweat: which deliver'd me from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of my pains at the end of three hours, but I had still some pain for the two dayes following,
but by intervals, and it was as if I had been prick'd with a Needle: nay indeed for many years
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47786:129"/>
afterwards I have been troubled with the same pains at certain times, especially in <hi>Autumn,</hi>
much about the Sun's entrance into <hi>Scorpio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is also in these parts another sort of insect of a making much like a Spider,<note place="margin">Another venemous insect.</note> about two
inches in compass, and mark'd with several spots. This insect is commonly found lodg'd in sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places, under a kind of Herb, which the <hi>Persians</hi> call <hi>Tremne,</hi> and the <hi>Turks, Iauchschan,</hi>
which is like Worm-wood, or <hi>Absynthium,</hi> but the leaves are much larger, and the smell much
stronger. The <hi>Persians</hi> call this insect <hi>Enkurek;</hi> and it is that animal which, in Latin, is called
<hi>Stellio,</hi> and kind of insect, which the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Tarantola.</hi> This Creature,
instead of stinging or biting,<note place="margin">Its venom, and the effect of it.</note> lets fall its venom like a drop of water, which immediately causes
insufferable pain in the part where it fastens, and suddenly making its way to the Stomack,
sends up Vapour into the Head, and these put all the Members of the sick party into such a
profound sleep, that it is impossible to awake him, save by this only remedy, which is, to
crush one of these Creatures upon the wound;<note place="margin">The remedy.</note> out of which all the venom is by that means
drawn out.</p>
                     <p>But if there cannot any of the same Creature be found; there is another remedy may be
used. The sick person is laid upon his back, that he may swallow down as much Milk as may
be. Then he is put upon a thing made like a bier, which, by cords fasten'd to the four corners,
is hung up to a beam, and having turn'd the bier about, till the cords are all twisted, they let it
go of a sudden, that the cords coming to untwist by a violent Motion, may make his head turn,
and force out of his stomack all the Milk he had swallow'd. It comes from him all Greenish, as
is also the cruds which come forth at his yard, but with great violence and extreme pain. This
remedy does in some measure Cure the sick person; yet so as that it hinders not, but that, at
certain times, especially at the same season of the year, he must expect to feel much pain.
This Creature is to be found only in the Country, so that those who live in Cities fear it not,
there being none there,<note place="margin">Sheep eat these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects.</note> unless they are, through negligence, brought in the stubble, wherewith
they cover their Houses. But what's most to be admir'd in this animal, is, that the Sheep seek
after it, and feed on it.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Katchan</hi> relate, that <hi>Omar ben Alchitabi,</hi> the third Successor of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>

hands under one of the Mill-stones which was rais'd up; which <hi>Omar</hi> having done, the Miller
let it fall and set the Mill a going, by which means having crush'd his hands to pieces, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

as soon as the Moon was up, which was then at the full. That Night we travell'd six Leagues

narrow, and withall very nasty, we lodg'd our selves in a Garden not far from it, in the shade
of abundance of Cypress Trees and Pomegranate-Trees, upon the side of a pleasant Rivulet,
which, making a gentle murmuring noise, contributed much to the repose, which, after the
precedent night's Travel, was but necessary to us. In the Evening, we continu'd our Journey,
and travell'd that night six Leagues or better, through Deserts and Barren grounds, and came,
the 28. about four in the morning, to a little City, called by the Inhabitants of the Country
<hi>Natens,</hi>

within the City, which is handsome enough, furnish'd with several Springs of fresh water, and
well stor'd with all sorts of Fruits. As you come into the City, you leave on the right hand
two very high and picked Mountains, one whereof hath on the top of it a great Tower, built
by <hi>Schach Abas,</hi> in memory of the advantage, which one of his Falcons had in that place
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47786:129"/>
over an Eagle, which he set upon, overcame, and kill'd, after a very sharp engagement. All
of our Retinue being either sick or overcome with weariness, only Monsieur <hi>Mandelslo</hi> had the
curiosity to get up the said Mountain with his two servants, and to take a view of that structure.
He found it built of Brick, and that towards the foundation it was in an Octogonal form, being
about eight paces Diameter; but that as it went higher and higher, it by degrees lost that form
and bigness, and that above, near the top, it had so many windows, that the light came in of
all sides. The greatest Miracle of all is, how they could carry so many materials up to so high
a place, to get to which, that Gentleman had spent above three hours, and at least as much to
get down again, with great pains and hazard.</p>

                        <hi>August</hi> 2. we departed thence two hours before day, the Moon shining bright, and got
but two leagues further, to one of the Kings houses, where we took up our quarters in a very
fair Garden, which was our last nights Lodging in our passage to the City of <hi>Ispahan.</hi> For,
very betimes the next morning being the third of <hi>August,</hi> horses were sent us, to make our
entrance into the Metropolis of the Kingdom. Within a quarter of a League of the City, we
found one of the principal Officers of the Court, named <hi>Isachan-beg,</hi> in the head of 200 horse,
and some paces thence, two great <hi>Armenian</hi> Lords, named <hi>Sefaras-beg,</hi> and <hi>Elias-beg,</hi> who
conducted the Ambassadors to their Lodgings The dust, which the horse, and the people who
came to meet us, had rais'd, was so thick, that we were got to the Gates, before we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
we could have seen the City. Not only the streets and windows were full of people, who
out of curiosity were come to see our entrance into the City, but also the tops of the houses
were covered with them.</p>
                     <p>We were conducted through several streets,<note place="margin">Are lodg'd among the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                        </note> through the <hi>Maidan,</hi> and before the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,

of the chiefest of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants, who are <hi>Christians,</hi> and have their habitations

unlading of the Baggage (though that should have been the employment of their Steward or
some other Officer) would have wav'd the visit upon that pretence. But the <hi>Dutchman</hi> would
not be put off his visit, wherein he ingenuously acknowledg'd, that he had received Orders
from his Superiours to oppose our Negotiation; but that nevertheless, as to what concern'd
the Ambassadors themselves, he should do them all the civilities they could expect from
him. He seem'd desirous to drink, and we had the Complyance to give him his load ere he
went away.</p>
                     <p>The joy we conceiv'd at our having,<note place="margin">A quarre. with the <hi>Indian</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks.</note> at last, arriv'd to a place, where we hoped to put a
period to our Negotiation, was soon disturbed by a most unhappy accident, and the Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
intended us, were within a few days after our coming thither, changed into a bloudy
Contestation with the <hi>Indians,</hi> occasion'd by the insolence of one of the Domesticks belonging
to the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Ambassador, who was Lodg'd not far from our Quarters, with a Retinue of
three hundred persons, most of them <hi>Vsbeques.</hi> One of their Domesticks standing by, and
looking on our people unloading and putting up the Baggage, our <hi>Mehemanders</hi> servant, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Willichan,</hi> said to him jesting, that it would speak more good nature in him, to come and
help them, than to stand as he did with his Arms a-cross; whereto the other making answer
somewhat too snappishly, as he conceiv'd, the <hi>Persian</hi> struck him over the pate with his Cane.
The <hi>Indian</hi> incens'd at the affront, ran to some of his Camerades, who were lying hard by
under the shade of a Tree, and made his complaints to them of the injury he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;
upon which they all got up, and fell upon <hi>Wellichan,</hi> whom they wounded in the head
with stones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:47786:130"/>
Our Domesticks perceiving this tumult, brought our Steward notice of it, who taking along
with him five or six Soldiers, and some others of our servants, charg'd the <hi>Indians</hi> (whole
number was augmented to hear thirty) so home, that they mortally wounded one, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd
the rest to their Quarters: but what most troubled the <hi>Indians,</hi> was, that, in this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they had lost a Sword and a Poniard, whereto a little Purse was faste'd, in which
there was some small money, which our People brought home as a sign of their Victory. The
<hi>Industhans,</hi> at that time, thought it enough to threaten how highly they should resent that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
and that they should take occasion to revenge their Camerade. Nor indeed were they
unmindful of their threats; for the Ambassadors having resolv'd to change their Lodgings, by
reason of the great inconvenience it was to them, that their Domesticks were scatter'd up and
down the Suburbs, and quarter'd at a great distance from them, and having appointed the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of <hi>August</hi> for their removal, the <hi>Indians</hi> took their advantage of that occasion, to be
satisfy'd for the affront they imagin'd they had received.</p>
                     <p>We had sent before a Lacquey belonging to our Steward, and some of our Seamen with part
of the Baggage, to be, by them, conducted to the Lodgings we had taken up, which were
within the City, a quarter of a League or better distant from the former. Certain <hi>Indians</hi>
who were lying under Tents to keep their Master's Horses, which were then feeding between
the City and Suburbs, knew him, as having seen him in the former engagement, set upon
him, and, though he gallantly defended himself with his Sword and Pistol, at last kill'd him
with their Arrows; which done, they cut off his head, toss'd it up and down in the Air, and
bound his body to his Horse-tayl; which dragg'd it to a certain place, where the Dogs devour'd
it. The news brought us of this Murther was enough to assure us, that the <hi>Industhans</hi> would
not think that revenge enough, but that they were resolv'd to set upon us with all their forces.
Whereupon the Ambassadors sent out Orders, that all of their Retinue should stand upon their
Guard, and come with all expedition to their Lodgings. But, before this Order could be put
in Execution, the <hi>Indians</hi> had already possess'd themselves of all the Avenues of their Quarters,
which they had in a manner block'd up: in so much that none could get in, without running
the hazard of being kill'd. However, reflecting on the imminent and inevitable danger it was to
lie scatter'd up and down in several quarters, most of the Domesticks thought it their safest
course, though with some danger, to make their way to the House where the Ambassadors
were, which was in the corner of a narrow street. Most of them escap'd the fury of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
but some were mortally wounded, and I my self came very near it, for I was no sooner
got within the door, but an Arrow came grazing through my hair, and was shot into one of
the Posts. All their Arrows were made of Canes, having a sharp and cutting piece of Iron at
the end, and so light, that the least strength sent them away with incredible swiftness, and
they pierc'd where they lighted, as dangerously as a Bullet from a Fire-lock. Which is the
more to be observ'd, in opposition to that passage of <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> where he sayes in the
eighth book of his History, <hi>Binum cubitorum sunt sagittae (Indis) quas emittunt majore nisu
quam effectu; quippe telum, cujus in levitate vis omnis est, inhabili pondere oneratur.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these Arms, they had also Muskets, and Arquebuses, according to the <hi>Persian</hi> way, which
are of a very small bore, wherewith they shot very exactly.</p>
                     <p>Our Lieutenants did all that could be expected from persons of courage and conduct, setting
their Soldiers in Order at the Door of the Ambassadors Lodgings, and causing several Volleys
of Musket-shot to be discharg'd at the <hi>Indians.</hi> But the <hi>Indians</hi> made their advantage of a Wall,
which serv'd them for a Parapet; and they had made several holes in it, that they might shoot
with less danger to themselves, and more annoyance to us. On the contrary, our people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of following their example (whom some would have accounted <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but who
will not be found such) and making their advantage of the Chests, and the Baggage, which
were in the street, had no other Parapet, than their own Breasts, which were expos'd to all
their Volleys. One of our Canoneers, as he was going to level a small Piece at the <hi>Indians,</hi>
was kill'd.</p>
                     <p>Sergeant <hi>Morrhoy,</hi> a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> seeing the Canoneer fall at his feet, took up his Musket,
and set himself in a posture of revenging his Camerades death. He was so fortunate as to kill
five or six <hi>Indians,</hi> but at last an Arrow takes him just in the breast, which, not at all troubled
at, he pluck'd it out, and, having charg'd his Musket once more, kill'd another man, and then
fell down dead upon the place,</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Armenians</hi> living thereabouts, who were Spectators of this engagement, could help
us no otherwise than with their tears, whereby they express'd the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fliction it was to them to
see the death of so many poor <hi>Christians.</hi> At last, the number of the <hi>Indians</hi> increasing still,
the Muskets play'd so fast, that the Ambassadors were forc'd to command their people to come
into the house, and, remaining in the Court, to keep the <hi>Indians</hi> from getting into the house.
But they making their advantage of our retreat, fell upon the Baggage, and ransack'd it, and
not content with that, they forc'd their way into the next house to us, and because the Master
of it would have kept them from coming in, they cut off one of his hands, and afterwards kill'd
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47786:130"/>
him. By which means getting up to the top of it, they could look into our Court, and so forc'd
our people to abandon it. Some of ours got up to the top of our house, and making their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Parapet, no <hi>Indian</hi> appear'd but they shot at him, and no shot but did execution.

fearing a greater disorder, which might be of dangerous consequence among a people who had
never seen any thing of that nature, the King sent thither a hundred Souldiers well arm'd, in
the Head of a good number of the Inhabitants, but as soon as the <hi>Indians</hi> perceiv'd that Body
coming towards them, they dispers'd themselves. We were told, that the King hearing of
the Murther, which was the Prologue to all this Tragedy, and withall that the <hi>Indian</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor

had moderated that sally of his Passion, by representing to him, that both the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
were Strangers, and his Guests, and that it belong'd to their Masters, and not to him, to
punish them.</p>
                     <p>This peace brought us also the liberty to go into the Streets, where we found our Chests
broke open, and all the Baggage plunder'd, unless it were certain Sawcidges, Neats-Tongues,
and Gammons of Bacon, which the <hi>Indians,</hi> as being <hi>Mahumetanes,</hi> had thrown by. Our loss
upon this occasion amounted to above four thousand-Crowns. The King demanded a particular
of it, and would have defray'd us; but that kindness of his had not its effect, for reasons but
too well known to all the Retinue.</p>
                     <p>In the fore-said engagement, which lasted above four hours, we lost five men, and had ten

                     <p>As to this <hi>Indian</hi> Ambassador, he was a <hi>Myrsa,</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Prince, and had been sent to the
Court of <hi>Persia,</hi> by <hi>Choramscha,</hi> King of the <hi>Indies,</hi> whom they call the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> and not,
as he is commonly called, <hi>Mogor.</hi> He had a very noble Retinue, and was ordinarily carried in
a Litter, according to the <hi>Indian</hi> making, more fit to lye down in, than to sit, which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by several Slaves, it being hang'd at a great Iron-barr made crooked in the middle. The
King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who knew on what occasion he was sent Ambassador to him, made him stay
three whole years,<note place="margin">His aboad at <hi>Ispahan</hi>
                        </note> before he gave him audience, ordering him in the mean time to be magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
treated, insomuch that some few dayes before our arrival, the King had sent him, besides
many before, a Present of three thousand <hi>Tumains,</hi> which amount to fifty thousand Crowns;
the Ambassador himself, it seems, defraying the expence of his House-keeping.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassador, on the othe other side, demean'd himself suitably to this magnificence;
for he spent the three first dayes after his audience in bestowing the Presents he had brought

hundred thousand Crowns.<note place="margin">The occas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> His business was, to intreat the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> to put into his
hands the <hi>Myrsa Polagi,</hi> Prince of the Blood, and Nephew to the <hi>Mogul,</hi> who had been forc'd
to retire into <hi>Persia</hi> to save his Life, which he was in danger to lose, as he had done his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
The King excus'd himself, and generously made answer, that it were a breach of the
Laws of Hospitality, to deliver up a Prince, who, out of an assurance of his friendship, had
taken refuge in his Kingdome; that he was oblig'd in honour to treat him as a Friend,
and a Guest, and to give him entertainment as long as he should think fit to stay in his
Countrey.</p>
                     <p>This was all the Answer the Ambassador could get,<note place="margin">He departs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> in relation to the Embassy; but that he
might be assur'd, they had no great kindness for himself in particular, secret orders were sent
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47786:131"/>
to <hi>Hassan-Chan</hi> Governour of <hi>Herath,</hi> which is the most considerable of any place towards the
Frontiers of the <hi>Indies,</hi> that he should stop, in their passage, four or five hundred Horses, which
the Ambassador had bought, and sent away by small parties, that, at his coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he might
find them ready upon the Frontiers: for the <hi>Indian</hi> Horses are small and ill-shap'd, whence it
comes, that the <hi>Indians</hi> are so desirous to have some of the <hi>Persian</hi> breed. The Ambassador
storm'd, alleg'd his quality, and urg'd it as an affront done his Master in his person, and, that
the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who knew he had bought them, and had permitted him to do so, was, no
doubt, willing he should take them along with him. But <hi>Hassan-Chan</hi> made answer, that he
was King in his own Province, that if he did ought prejudicial to the King's service, his Life
should answer for it, and that he would not suffer any Horses to go out of the Country, it being
to be fear'd they might afterwards be brought to serve in the Warrs against his Majesty, to
whom he was to give a strict accompt of all his actions. So that the Ambassador was forc'd to
leave the Horses behind him, and to sell them at such rates as the <hi>Persians</hi> would give him for
them. As for the <hi>Indians</hi> in general, they are good Natur'd, Civil, Friendly, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
not unpleasant, provided they be not injur'd; but so apt to resent any thing of affront,
that they are never satisfy'd without their Blood, by whom they are offended, We know it
otherwise than by hear-say.</p>
                     <p>The next day after this unhappy engagement, to wit, the 8. of <hi>August,</hi> we chang'd our
Lodgings, and, to prevent any disorder that might happen, especially upon the accompt of the
<hi>Indians,</hi> the King caus'd prohibitions to be made, that not only any of the Ambassadors Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
but also, of the other <hi>Indians,</hi> nay even the Merchants of that Nation, whereof there are
above twelve thousand in <hi>Ispahan,</hi> should, upon pain of Death, be seen in the streets, till we
were gotten within the City. And that we might be the more secure, we found attending near
our Lodgings, some of the Guard, who went along with us to our new Quarters, which we
were permitted to fortifie at the weakest places, against any attempt might be made by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
who might easily and with advantage have assaulted us in our Quarters, by reason it was
of a vast extent, they having openly threatned to do it.</p>
                     <p>The Structure comprehended four great Courts,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors change their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> through two whereof there ran a Rivulet
twenty five foot in breadth, planted on both sides with that delightfull Tree called <hi>Tzinnar,</hi>
which made two very pleasant walks. The same Rivulet ran through some of the Halls and
Galleries, and went under ground, under the main part of the Lodging; which was design'd
for the appartment of the Ambassadors. There was in the midst of it, and below, a spacious
Hall, built eight square, with a fair Fountain, and at every side of the Octagone a Door, which
led into several Chambers. The first Story had the same appartments, but this over and above,
that the Windows serv'd for Doors, some whereof led into Galleries and Balconies that look'd
into the Garden, some towards the Hall; so that a man might, out of any Chamber, see
what was done in the Hall. In the midst of the Hall, there was a Fountain, the Basin whereof
was of Freestone.</p>
                     <p>During our aboad at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> we were supply'd with all things upon the King's accompt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
allow'd,<note place="margin">The King treats them still.</note> every day, sixteen Sheep, a hundred of all sorts of tame Fowl, two hundred
Eggs, and a hundred <hi>Batmans</hi> of Wine, with Fruit and spice in such abundance, that we might
have made very good Cheer, had it not been for their ill management thereof, who had the
disposal of them, and who squander'd away the Provisions, not only by Connivence, but also
by the express order of one of the Ambassadors, I mean him of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> who sent them to
them <hi>Armenians,</hi> and, many times, to common prostitutes. Whence it came, that some times
our people made but one meal a day, nay some dayes, the servants and others had no cloath
laid at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 10. the Ambassadors sent some of the Retinue to <hi>Alexis Savinouits,</hi> Ambassador from
the Duke of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> to treat with him concerning their common affairs; and in regard the
<hi>Persians</hi> were not well pleas'd to see us in our own Cloaths, we put our selves into the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>
fashion,<note place="margin">They go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> habits</note> as coming somewhat nearer their mode. About this time, dyed some of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who had been Wounded, in the Engagement with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and, among others, one
of our Guard, who had been hurt in the knee, with a poisoned Arrow. Our <hi>Harbinger</hi> died also
the same day, but it was of a Bloody-flux, which took him after he had been sufficiently shaken
by a <hi>Tertian</hi> Ague, and dispatch'd him in a few dayes. VVe buried them both in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> in that part of the Suburbs, which is called <hi>Tzulfa.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>August</hi> the 16. the Ambassadors had their first audience of the King, who sent them word,
that they should also have the honour to dine with him,<note place="margin">Their first audience.</note> and to that end, sent them forty gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Horses out of his own Stables, the Saddles and Harnesses whereof were adorn'd with great
plates of Gold.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadors made use only of two,<note place="margin">The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents made in the Prince's name.</note> and also ordered the Gentlemen and the principal
Officers to ride on Horse-back, but the rest went a-foot, in the following order.</p>
                     <p>First, march'd three men or Horse-back, two whereof were in compleat arms, having
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47786:131"/>
Flowers, and other Workmanship of Gold. The third was arm'd only as a Horse-man, with
Back, Breast, and Pot, yet all very rich.</p>
                     <p>After him march'd forty Persons, having every one a Case of Pistols, the best that
could be had in the Low Countries, with their Holsters, the laps whereof were Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd.</p>
                     <p>Next, four men, carrying two rich Cymitars, the sheaths whereof were of yellow Amber,
garnish'd with Gold, in very rich Cases.</p>
                     <p>Next, two men, with Walking staves, done about with Amber, which the <hi>Persians</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
above Gold, in very rich Cases.</p>
                     <p>Four men, carrying so many great Candlesticks of Amber.</p>
                     <p>Two others, carrying a Cabinet of white and yellow Amber.</p>
                     <p>Four others, carrying a Cabinet of Ebony, garnish'd with Silver, having within it, in Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Boxes, several Druggs, Essences and Magisteries, and the coverings thereof beset with fine
stones, which signify'd what Magistery there was in every Box.</p>
                     <p>And whereas it is the custom of the Country,<note place="margin">The Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors Presents.</note> that Ambassadors are oblig'd to make some
Presents from themselves, and upon their own accompt, the Ambassador <hi>Crusius</hi> sent in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuss,
the stock whereof was of Ebony, which cock'd it self by letting down the Cock; A
vessel of Rock Chrystal, done about with Gold, and beset with Rubies and Turqueses; a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet
of Amber, and a small striking Clock. The Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> presented the King
with a gilt brass Candlestick, that had thirty branches, having a striking Watch within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of it; a pair of gilt Pistols, in very rich Holsters; a very fair Hour-glass; a Watch in a
Topaze case; a Bracelet of Diamonds and Rubies; and, a Writing, whereby were presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the two pieces of Canon, which we had left at <hi>Ardebil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every one had his place assign'd him,<note place="margin">The <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve no Order in their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> to the end that all things might be presented to the

insomuch, that they were no sooner got into the street, but they were all in disorder, and
march'd with such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>onfusion, that the Ambassadors Retinue could not make the Procession they
expected.</p>
                     <p>First, there should have march'd three Sergeants with Halberds, in the Head of fifteen Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.
After them the Mashal, or Steward, alone, in the Head of the Gentlemen, who march'd
three a breast. Then, three Trumpeters, with silver Trumpets, and after them march'd the
Guards, four a-breast, immediately before the Ambassadors, who had on both sides eight
Halberteers, and behind them the two Interpreters. The eight Pages follow'd, on horse-back,
in very rich Liveries, and after them the rest of our people, marching three a-breast, and eight
deep.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadors being come in this order, attended by a great number of <hi>Kisibachs,</hi> and
<hi>Persian</hi> Gentlemen on Horse-back, whom the King had sent to them, through the <hi>Maidan,</hi>
to the Gates of the Palace-Royal, they were there received by <hi>Iesaul Senhobet,</hi> who is as it
were the Introductor,<note place="margin">The recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</note> or Master of the Ceremonies. He commanded those who carried the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to make way for the Ambassadors, whom he conducted into a Hall, where the <hi>Divanbeki,</hi>
or Judges, are wont to meet, for the Administration of Justice, and intreated them to rest
themselves, till he had acquainted the King with their arrival. About half an hour after, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
great Lords came to give the Ambassadors notice, that the King expected them. We
were brought through a spacious Court, which was of greater length than breadth, and in
which there was on both sides, about six paces distance from one Wall, another lower Wall,
built close to a row of <hi>Tzinnar</hi>-Trees; and all along that lower Wall, stood the Musketiers,
and the other Guards, in a file on both sides.</p>
                     <p>The Guards were distinguish'd from the Musketiers, by the Coiffure they wore about their
heads, which was pointed, and set out with plumes of Feathers, of several Colours. They
call this kind of Courts or Walks, <hi>Cheywan,</hi> and they afford a very delightful prospect. At
the end of this Court, there was a great Hall, having light coming in of all sides, which was
the place design'd for our audience.<note place="margin">The Hall for audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> It is called <hi>Diwan Chane,</hi> as being the place, where the
King administers Justice in Person: there being a great difference between the Custom of <hi>Persia,</hi>
and that of <hi>Muscovy;</hi> where the Great Duke hath a particular Hall, wherein he gives audience
to Ambassadors; whereas the King of <hi>Persia</hi> does it in those places where he accidentally is,
either about other business, or for his Divertisement. Near the said Hall, and under those
Trees, between the two Walls, there were to be seen fifty excellent Horses, with their cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Cloaths
of Brocado, or Embroider'd with Gold and Silver, and among those some <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian</hi>
Horses, ready to be back'd, with their Saddles and Harness, cover'd all over with
plates of Gold, and beset with abundance of precious stones. All the Horses stood in the open
Air, fasten'd by one of the hinder feet to a stake struck in the ground, and they were most of
them of an <hi>Isabella</hi> Colour, about the Belly and Legs. There stood hard by Pails of Vermili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Gilt,<note place="margin">Silver Pails to water hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> for the watering of them. Not far thence, there were two great Cisterns four foot
square, for the cooling of Wine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:47786:132"/>
This Hall was rais'd three steps from the ground, and was eight fathom broad, and twelve
in length. There was at the entrance into it a Partition, like an <hi>Alcove,</hi> with Curtains drawn
before it, of red Cotton, which were taken up and let down with silk strings. When they were
drawn up, they rested upon the Chapters of certain wooden Pillars, made Cylinder-wise, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellish'd
with Branch-work, Painted, and Gilt, as were also the Walls. On the left hand, as
you came in, there were some pieces of Painting, done in <hi>Europe,</hi> and representing certain Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories.
The floor was cover'd all over with Tapistry, whereof the ground-work was of Gold
and Silver, and in the midst of the Hall, there was a Fountain, and in the Basin of it abundance
of Flowers, Citrons, Orenges, Apples, and other Fruits, which swom upon the water. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the sides of the Basin, there were a great number of Gold and Silver Flaggons, and Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
which either had Garlands or Flowers about them, or posies in their Mouths.</p>
                     <p>The King sate upon the ground,<note place="margin">The King's age.</note> having a satin Cushion under him, behind the Fountain,
with his back to the VVall. He was about seven and twenty years of Age, handsome Bodied,
having a gracefull Aspect, and of a clear and smooth Complexion, somewhat Hawk-Nos'd, as
most of the <hi>Persians</hi> are, and he had a little black Hair upon the upper lip. There was nothing
extraordinary in his Habit, save that his Cloaths were of Brocadoe, and that, at his Coiffure,
there was a Plume of Heron-Feathers, fasten'd with a bracelet of Diamonds. He had also upon
his <hi>Kurdi,</hi> that is, a kind of Coat without Sleeves, which the <hi>Persians</hi> wear upon their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
two Sable Skins hanging at the Neck: but for ought we saw afterwards, other <hi>Persian</hi>
Lords wore the like. The Cymitar he had by his side glitter'd with Gold and Precious Stones;
and behind him, upon the ground, there lay a Bow and Arrows.</p>
                     <p>On his right hand there stood twenty Pages, who were, most of them, as we were told,
the sons of <hi>Chans,</hi> and <hi>Sulthans,</hi> Governours of Provinces, among whom there were some
<hi>Eunuchs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They were all very handsome, as to their Persons, but it seems, they had made choice of the
handsomest among them, to hold the Fan, wherewith he incessantly gave the King air. These
Fanns are made of a certain Sea-Creature, which they call <hi>Maherikutas,</hi> and it is like a Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail.
Near the Pages stood the <hi>Meheter,</hi> or Groom of the Chamber, who hath the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of them. Before the King stood <hi>Elschick agasi baschi,</hi> or the Lord Chamberlain of the
Houshold, having in his hand a Staff cover'd all over with Gold, as was also the great Button
or Apple at the top of it. VVithin four paces of the King, and on his left hand, sat the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
whom they call <hi>Ethemad Dowlet,</hi> and about him, the <hi>Chans,</hi> and great Lords of the
Privy Counsell. At the entrance of the Hall, on the left hand, sat the Ambassadors of an <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi>
Prince, who had been sent to desire the King's Protection against the Turk; and the
<hi>Poslanick</hi> of <hi>Muscovy, Alexei Savinouits;</hi> and somewhat lower were placed the King's

Ambassadors along, laid such fast hold on their hands, that they had not the use of them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>This Ceremony is very necessary, and must now be look'd on as a particular honour done
the Ambassadors, though it be said, and that very probably, that with the same labour, they
secure the Prince's Life, against the attempts there might be made against it. But I would not
have any to credit what some affirm, to wit, that this Ceremony hath not been observ'd in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>
but since the Reign of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> and that it was occasion'd by the design which some <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi>
Ambassadors had to kill him. For this custom is also observ'd in the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi>'s Court,
as well as in <hi>Persia;</hi> nay it is my opinion, that it is for the same reason, that the King does not
give his Hand, but his Knee to strangers to kiss, to his own Subjects thinking it enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
his foot.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadors, as they came near the King, made a low Reverence, which he civilly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
with a little Inclination of the Head, and a smiling and obliging Countenance. They
were immediately led away, and intreated to sit down, on low Seats, which had been plac'd
near the Lords of the Councel. The same honour was done to fifteen of the Retinue, but they
were forc'd to sit down a little more on the left hand, and upon the ground. The ground. The Pages, and
the rest of the Retinue, were conducted into the Court, where they were seated, near thirteen
VVomen-Dancers, who were very handsome VVomen, and very richly Cloath'd, and sate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Tapistry, whereof the ground-work was Gold and Silver.</p>
                     <p>Some of our people were perswaded they were the ordinary Dancing-women belonging to
the Court, and gave that accompt of them in the Relations they have made of their Travells;
but it is certain, they were some of the handsomest Curtezans of the City, who, besides the
Tribute they yearly pay the King, are oblig'd to come to Court, to divert the Prince, when
ever he sends for them. VVe were told, that a man might have had his choice of them for a
<hi>Tumain.</hi>
                     </p>

The Ambassadors having rested themselves a little, the King sent the Lord Chamberlain to
them, to know the Prince's name, by whom they were sent, and the occasion of their Embassy.
Which message oblig'd them to rise up, and to go near the King, with their Interpreter, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
their Credentials, which they accompany'd with a Complement, which was so much the
shorter, in regard the <hi>Persians,</hi> who are no Lovers of long Speeches, would have those that
approach their King to do it with respect, and to express that respect by a Discourse of few
words. The Chancellor receiv'd the Credentials, and after the Ambassadors were seated again,
the <hi>Wakaenuis,</hi> or Secretary of the Chamber, came and told them, that the <hi>Schach</hi> would or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Credential letters to be Translated; that as soon as it were done, his Majesty would
give them a second audience, for their affairs, and that in the mean time, he desir'd them to
Divert themselves as much as might be. This done, the Presents were brought in, which were
carried, close by the King, into an appartment design'd for the Treasury, on one side of the
Hall, at the entrance of the Palace.</p>
                     <p>While the Presents were carried in, the Cloath was laid, that is, all the floor of the Hall
was cover'd with one piece of Cotton Cloath, on which were set all sorts of Fruits and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
all in great Basins of Gold,<note place="margin">Gold Plate.</note> whereof there was so great a number, that there was hardly
place left for three hundred great Flaggons of the same Metal, which were dispers'd here and
there, only for Ostentation sake: so that which way soever a man look'd, there was nothing
to be sent but Gold. All the Plate was plain and smooth, save only the Flaggon and Cup out
of which the King himself drunk, which two pieces the <hi>Persians</hi> call <hi>Surhahi,</hi> and <hi>Piali,</hi> which
were beset with Rubies and Turqueses. With these conserves, we had excellent <hi>Schiras</hi>-wine,<note place="margin">Schiras-<hi>wine.</hi>
                        </note>
and they gave us the Divertisement of a fellow that shew'd tricks of Legerdemain, who did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
any thing I ever saw of that kind before. About an hour after, the Conserves were taken
away, that the Meat might be brought in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The floor was laid with another Cloath; which
was of a Gold Brocado, and there came in ten men loaden with Meat in great Vessels of Gold,
made like the Milk-pails in <hi>France,</hi> which some carried upon their Heads, some upon a kind of
Barrows, which were also cover'd with plates of Gold.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Suffretzi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Carver.</note> that is, the Carver, having plac'd the Meat, sate down in the midst of the
Table, or floor of the Hall, took the Meat out of those Vessels, and dispos'd it into Dishes, and
sent them, first to the King, then to the Ambassadors, and afterwards to the Lords, and the
rest of the Company. They understand not what it is to entertain with several Courses, but set
down all upon the Table at once, and think they treat their Guests very well. All the Dishes
were fill'd with Rice of all sorts of Colours, and the Carver put the Meat upon the Rice, to wit,
Mutton, boyl'd and roasted, tame and wild Fowl, Omelets, Pies, Spinage, Sow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>-cruds, &amp;c.
insomuch, that many times, there was five or six sorts of Meat in the same Dish. This is done
by design,<note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at meat.</note> and for their own convenience; in regard, that, not sitting at a Table opposite one
to another, but all of a side, as the <hi>Monks</hi> do, and consequently one man being not able to
reach to several Dishes, they are served several sorts of Meat in the same Dish.</p>
                     <p>But as we imitated the <hi>Monks</hi> in our manner of sitting,<note place="margin">Silence at
meats.</note> so were we as silent as they are at
Meals: for there was not a word spoken all the time we were at Meat; unless it were that the
King himself whisper'd twice or thrice to the Chancellor. But there was not that silence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
at two or three other Entertainments we had at the Court afterwards: for then, the King
was pleas'd to fall into some discourse with the Ambassadors, concerning the affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and particularly concerning the Warrs of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We had also,<note place="margin">Musick.</note> while we were at Dinner, the Divertisement of their Musick, and the Activity
of those <hi>Curtezans.</hi> The Musick consisted of Lutes, Violins, Flageolets, Hawboies, and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels,
which he who play'd upon the Timbrel, accompany'd with a wretched inharmonious
Voice, which disorder'd the little Consort there was in their pretended Consort. The Dancing
of the Women was more regular, and though it was not consonant to the Musick, nor the way
of Dancing among the <hi>Europaeans,</hi> yet was it not undelightfull, but had its cadences and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as well as ours.</p>
                     <p>While we were at Dinner, there lay hid, in a Door which was cover'd by the Hangings, over
against the place where the Ambassadors sat, a <hi>Persian,</hi> who understood the <hi>Portuguez</hi> and
<hi>Italian,</hi> to observe their Demeanour, as also what discourse they might have with their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that he might give an accompt of what they said concerning the fashions and manners of
that Court. The relation he gave in to the King of what the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> had said of
the Pictures, and the Entertainments, and the manner of Life of the <hi>Persians,</hi> prov'd to his
disadvantage and Prejudice. Our Interpreter was a <hi>Portuguez,</hi> an <hi>Augustine</hi> Frier, about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years of age. His name was Father <hi>Ioseph, of the Rosary,</hi> a good natur'd man, obliging, and
complaisant, and a person that understood himself very well; inasmuch, as, having liv'd four
and twenty years in <hi>Persia,</hi> he was excellently well skill'd in the Language, and throughly
acquainted with the humour and customs of that Nation. In his discourse with the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<hi>Crusius,</hi> he made use of the Latin Tongue, and spoke <hi>Portuguez</hi> to the Ambassador
<hi>Brugman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:47786:133"/>
They sat at Dinner about an hour and a half, and then the Cloath being taken away, there
was warm water brought to wash their hands. Which done, the Lord Chamberlain cry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,
<hi>Suffre Hakine, Scahe douletine, Kasiler Kuwetine, alla dielum;</hi> that is, <hi>Make us thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for this repast, prosper the King's affairs, give his Soldiers and Servants courage; this we
pray thee, O God:</hi> whereto all the rest answer their <hi>Alla, Alla.</hi> Grace being thus said, they
rose up, and went out of the room one after another, without speaking a word, according to
the custom of the Country. Our <hi>Mehemander</hi> came also to tell us that we might withdraw
when we pleas'd; as we immediately did, making a low Reverence to the King.</p>
                     <p>After this first audience, we were permitted to receive the Visits of all other Nations, who
have any Commerce at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> as the <hi>French, Spaniards, Italians, English</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi> They
came often to see us, and contributed much to our Divertisement, during the aboad we made
in that City, The <hi>English</hi> were the first that gave us a Visit. Their Factor, whose name was
<hi>Francis Honywood,</hi> came to our Quarters the 18 of <hi>August,</hi> accompany'd by a considerable
number of Merchants, who, to express the affection they bore us, had all put themselves into
the <hi>German</hi> fashion, though otherwise they went according to the mode of their own Country.
The Factor was an excellent good natur'd man, and excessively civil. He immediately made prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of his service to us, and afterwards made them good upon all occasions, and kept us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
most part of that day.</p>
                     <p>The 22. The King sent the Ambassadors a Present of Fruits, as Melons, Apples, Pears,
Grapes, Quinces; and others, and, along with it, thirty great Flaggos of most excellent
<hi>Schiras</hi>-Wine.</p>
                     <p>The 24. the Ambassadors had their first private audience,<note place="margin">The first private Audience.</note> concerning their Negotiation, at
which was the King himself in Person, attended by the Chancellor, and a great number of the
Lords of the Councel. This conference was not had in the <hi>Divan-Chane,</hi> but in another apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
into which we were brought, through a spacious Gallery, and afterwards through a
fair Garden, where those of our Retinue found their Divertisement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while the Ambassadors,
with their Interpreter, were employ'd about their affairs. The King had the patience to stay
there two hours and better, and as we came out thence, Dinner was going in, whereto all
the Company was invited, all being placed, and treated in the same manner as we had been
before.</p>

Church, live like Brethren and true Christians, among their common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
                     <p>There were in the Monastery in all, but six <hi>Spanish Monks,</hi> and yet they had built a very vast
Structure, with a very fair Church belonging to it, which had two Steeples, but somewhat low,
a stately Cloister, several Cells, and a large Garden.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadors went thither on Horseback, in regard that, though the Monastery were
within the City, yet was it above a League from our quarters; and the Religious men, who
receiv'd them at the entrance of the Monastery, conducted them straight to the Church, which
was adorn'd with abundance of Pictures, and Gilt in several places. They presently began
Mass, during which we had pretty good Musick, for one of their Monks had some skill upon
the Organ, and our Musicians had brought thither their Lutes and Violins. After Mass, we
were carried into the Garden, near a Fountain, and under the shade of a Tree, the branches
whereof were so full of Leaves, and so woven one within another, that they compass'd the
Fountain, and in several places reaching down to the ground, they made convenient seats. The
Clock striking twelve,<note place="margin">Dl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Tables, which were plac'd all along the Walls, after the same manner as may be seen in the
Monasteries of Religious men in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Tables were cover'd with all sorts of Fruits, in dishes of Porcelane, and the Cloath was
all strew'd with Flowers. Every one had his dish of Meat by himself, plenty of all things, and
all very well dress'd, yet not without some respect to frugality. After Dinner, which lasted
not so long as we had been at the entertainments of the <hi>Persians,</hi> or those we were invited to
by some forein Merchants, we return'd into the Garden, where we pass'd away the remainder
of the day, under the shade of the same Tree.</p>
                     <p>VVith the beginning of <hi>September,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">SEPT.</note> we began to be sensible of a change of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>About this time <hi>Seferas-beg,</hi> Governour of <hi>Armenia,</hi> accompany'd by his two Brothers,
came to see the Ambassadors, with a design to make acquaintance, and contract Friendship
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47786:133"/>
with them. They were all three persons of an excellent good disposition, free in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
and Civil, which gain'd so much upon the nature of the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> who lov'd
people of that Kidney, and was himself of a free Humour, that he presented the two Elder,
each of them, with a handsome Fowling-piece, and the younger with a Case of Pistols. They
took those Presents so kindly, that, to express their gratitude, they resolv'd to make an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
for the Ambassadors, for which they appointed the 18 of <hi>September,</hi> and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to bring all their Retinue along with them. They sent us Horses to bring us, and some
of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants to accompany us.</p>
                     <p>We brought along with us two <hi>Portuguez</hi> Monks, the Prior of the <hi>Augustines,</hi> and our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Interpreter. <hi>Seferas-beg</hi> receiv'd the Ambassadors at the entrance of the Church, in the
Suburbs called <hi>Tzulfa,</hi> where he had the service said by the Patriarch of the place, who had
about him a Cope of Cloath of Silver, with flowers of Gold, beset with great Pearls, and a
Mitre of the same Stuff, cover'd all over with round Pearls. The Body of the Church was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with several large Pictures, the floor was cover'd with the Tapistry of the Country, and
they had placed benches all along the walls for our more convenient sitting. They had also a
kind of wretched Musick. Having done our Devotions, we got on horse-back again to goe to
the place where the entertainment was prepared for us. <hi>Seferas-beg,</hi> having receiv'd the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
with much respect, and done his civilities to the chiefest of the Retinue, conducted
them, through a spacious arched Gallery, into a great Garden, at the end whereof we found
an open hall, according to the fashion of the Country, where we were intreated to sit down
on the ground. The Cloath, which was of Gold and Silver Brocado, was cover'd with all
sorts of Fruits and Conserves, and we drank of a certain prepar'd water, much like <hi>Ros Solis,</hi>
but incomparably more delicate, and more precious. Having taken away the Fruits, they laid
an <hi>Indian</hi> Cotton cloath, and the Meat was brought up, in silver Dishes. It was excellently
well dress'd, according to the <hi>Persian</hi> way of dressing, with this difference only, that at this
entertainment there was brought in Pork, and some other sorts of flesh, for which the <hi>Persians</hi>
have an aversion. We had hardly eaten so much as allay'd our first hunger, ere we were forc'd
to rise from the Table, to be conducted through a very noble apartment, into another hall,
which look'd into the Garden. It was arched all about, and there were on the Walls certain
Pictures representing the Women of most Nations in the World, dress'd according to the mode
of their several Countries. The floor was cover'd with rich Tapistry, on which were laid
Cushions of flower'd Satin, the ground-work thereof Gold and Silver. In the midst of the
hall, there was a Fountain, the Basin whereof was of white Marble; the water was cover'd
with Flowers; and it was beset all about with Flaggons, and Bottles of Wine.</p>
                     <p>We were invited to sit down, and to eat of the Fruit and Conserves, which were brought
in, during which we had the Divertisement of Musick and Dancing. And as a further honour
to us,<note place="margin">Musick.</note> the Patriarch was sent for, who came in immediately, having about him a Cassock of
water'd Chamlet of a Violet Colour, and attended by two Priests clad in black, with Caps on
their Heads. He was no ill Company: but the second of the two Brethren, whose name was
<hi>Elias-beg,</hi> made the best sport of any in the company. For, to heighten the Divertisement of
the Ambassadors, he would needs play on the <hi>Tamera,</hi> which is an Instrument used by the
<hi>Persians</hi> instead of the Late: and then he call'd for seven Porcelane Cups,<note place="margin">Porcelane Musick.</note> full of water, and
striking them with two little sticks, he accorded them with the Lute. While we were heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to this Musick, <hi>Seferas-beg</hi> told us, that he would give us a kind of Musick, which
should be as delightful as the other; and thereupon rising up, he ordered to be brought him,
by two Pages, in two great wooden Dishes, several Chrystal Glasses, which he distributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Company, to whom he began the King of <hi>Persia's</hi> health. The whole day was spent
in these divertisements,<note place="margin">The magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of an <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Lord.</note> till that the Ambassadors perceiving night approach, took leave of
their Hosts; but these, pretending to conduct us out of the house, brought us to the other side
of the Garden, into a Gallery, where we found the Cloath laid, and cover'd with all sorts of
Meat, Flesh, Fish, Pies, Fruits and Conserves, for the Collation. We sat down again, but it
was only out of compliance, for it is not to be imagin'd we could have eaten ought. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
can I believe, that he by whom we were entertain'd had any other design therein than to
shew his Magnificence, and the Gallantry and Freedome of his Nature, especially in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the darkest Night to bright Day. The Hall was all full of Lamps, which hung by a
string fasten'd to the Roof, there being so great a number of them, and those so near one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that their Lights were so confounded, as that they made but one. There was also in
the Garden, a great number of Torches and Candles, which wrought the same effect
there.</p>
                     <p>Having, with much ado and many Complements, taken our leave, we could not by any
means put off the second Brother out of a humour had taken him to accompany us to our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
where he made a shift to get perfectly drunk, with <hi>Aquavitae</hi> and <hi>Ros Solis.</hi> And thus we
concluded that day, which I confess was one of the most pleasant we had had in all our Travels,
having been better treated, than we had been by the King himself.</p>

The 19. The Ambassadors had their second private audience, which the King gave them in
another apartment, at the end of a Garden, and which lasted not above half an hour; in regard
the Council took time to consider of the Memorials they receiv'd in writing from them.<note place="margin">The second private Audience.</note> It is
ordinary to stay and Dine at the Court after the Conferences; therefore I shall forbear repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Circumstances, unless something in particular oblige me thereto: as it happen'd this
day, in that the King having heard that the Ambassadors had Musicians in their Retinue, he sent
them word, that he would gladly hear their Musick. It consisted of a base Viol, a Tenor, and
a Violin, which play'd about half an hour, till the King sent us word, that that Musick was not
ill, but that he thought that of the Country as good as it.</p>
                     <p>The 25. of <hi>September,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors treated by the <hi>English.</hi>
                        </note> the <hi>English</hi> made an entertainment for the Ambassadors and all their
Retinue, which, in Magnificence, surpass'd all the rest. Their House or Lodge, was in the
<hi>Basar,</hi> near the <hi>Maidan.</hi> The Structure was of great extent, divided into several appartments,
and had a very fair Garden. We were at first brought into a Gallery, where we found Fruits
and Conserves laid upon the floor, which was cover'd with Tapistry, according to the custom
of the Country; and having done there, we pass'd into a great Hall, where we found the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
furnish'd and serv'd after the <hi>English</hi> fashion.</p>
                     <p>They forgot not to drink the healths of most of the Kings and Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and we had
the Divertisement of Musick upon the Virginals. After Dinner, we were brought into
an open Hall, which look'd into the Garden, where we found a Collation of Conserves, with
the best Wine the Countrey could afford, And whereas we had often seen the Dancing-women
of the Country,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Indian</hi> Dancing-Women.</note> they sent for some <hi>Indian</hi> Women of the same profession. There were brought
six young Women, whereof some had their Husbands with them, who also either Danc'd or
Play'd upon Violins; some came in alone. They were all somewhat of an Olive-colour, but
had excellent good Features,<note place="margin">Handsome and well shap'd.</note> a delicate smooth Skin, and very handsome Bodies. They had
about their Necks much Gold and Pearls, and in their Ears Pendants of Gold or Silver, glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
with Jewels and Spangles.</p>
                     <p>Some of them had Bracelets of Pearl, others of Silver, but they had all Rings on their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and among the rest, they had upon the Thumb, upon which, in the place where the Stone
should be, there was a piece of Steel, about the bigness of a Crown-piece of Silver, and so well
polish'd, that it serv'd them for a Looking-glass. They were Cloath'd after a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">Their habit</note>
having on a kind of Stuff, which was so thin, that there was not any part of the Body but
might be seen by the Company, save only what was hidden by the Drawers which they wore
under their Petticoats. Some wore Caps on their Heads, others had them dress'd in Tiffany,
and some had silk Skarfs, wrought with Gold and Silver, which crossing their shoulders reach'd
down to the ground. Some were bare-foot, others were shod after a very strange manner. They
had above the instap of the foot a string ty'd, with little Bells fastened thereto, whereby they
discover'd the exactness of their Cadence, and sometimes corrected the Musick it self; as they
did also by the <hi>Tzarpanes,</hi> or <hi>Castagnetts,</hi> which they had in their hands, in the managing
whereof they were very expert. Their Musick consisted of Timbrels, according to the <hi>Indian</hi>
way of Playing on them, Tabors, and Pipes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Timbrels are two foot long, but broader in the middle than at the extremities,
much after the fashion of our Barrels. They hang them about their Necks, and play on them
with their fingers. The postures of these <hi>Indian</hi> VVomen in their Dancing are admirable.
Their hands and feet are alwayes in action, as is also their whole Body: and many times, they
address themselves to some particular person of the Company, either by an inclination of the
Body, or to get the little Present they expect, which they very handsomely beg, either by
stretching out their hands, yet so as that it seems to be done without any affectation, but as a
necessary consequence of the Dance. They are much more pleasant in their Conversation than
the Women of the Countrey. All these Dancing-women are common prostitutes, and very
free to shew all their postures for money, nay to do beyond what might be expected from
them. It was far-night ere we got away, which oblig'd the <hi>English</hi> to bring us home to our
Lodgings.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> Merchants made also an entertainment for the principal persons of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
and treated them, with some of the <hi>English</hi> Merchants, at a <hi>Caravansera,</hi> very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely.</p>
                     <p>The first of <hi>October,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">OCTOB.</note> the Ambassadors made a great Feast, whereto were invited the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>

and <hi>French</hi> Merchants, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monks of the order of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and some <hi>Italian</hi>
Carmelites. They treated them after the <hi>German</hi> way, with three several Courses, each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of forty Dishes. The Musick consisted of Violins, Trumpets, and Timbrels, which made
a goodly Noise, as did also our Cannon, when any Prince's health was drunk.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of <hi>Armenia,</hi> was taken, above all things, with certain services of Paste and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
according to the <hi>German</hi> fashion, which were brought to the Table, rather to divert the
Eye, than to sharpen the Appetite: and thought them so good, that having spoken of them at
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47786:134"/>
Court, the King would needs see some. Whence it came that the Ambassadors ordered some
of them to be made by our Cook; as also some Florentines, and other pieces of Pastry of that
kind, which he took very kindly, and presented them to some Ladies about the Court, who
thought them excellent good Meat.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon they had the Divertisement of seeing some run at the Ring,<note place="margin">Running at a Ring.</note> at which M.
<hi>Mandelslo</hi> got the prize, which was a great Silver Goblet, and the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> did
the best next him, and got a drinking Cup Vermilion gilt. Every time any one put into the
Ring, one of the Brass pieces was fired.</p>
                     <p>The next day the Prior of the <hi>Augustines</hi> came to the Secretary of the Embassy,<note place="margin">The scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Life of one of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.</note> to complain
to him of the debauch'd Lives of some of our Retinue, nay one of the chiefest among us, naming
particularly the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> and discover'd that there were some among us, who,
after the example of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> had married Women of the Country. He told him, that
they had conceived a great joy and comfort, at the first news of our Embassy's coming thither,
out of a hope, that our Lives would be an example to the <hi>Christians</hi> of the Country, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
among <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> were apt to fall into their vices and filthiness; but that, to his great
regret, he found the contrary: entreating the Secretary, to speak of it to those in whose pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
it was to take some course therein, so to prevent the scandal which was given to others, the
injury done to the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the infamy which must fall on the Prince, from whom
the Embassy was sent. The Secretary went, with a resolution to give the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi>
an accompt of these Remonstrances of the Priors, and to intreat him that some course might be
taken, that the Domesticks might reform their Lives; but it was his misfortune, that coming
into the Ambassador's Chamber, he found him in the company of an <hi>Armenian</hi> Woman, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Tulla.</hi> But the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> imagining the Secretary's design had been to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
him, was so incens'd thereat, that having sworn he would resent that affront, the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who had experience of his Revengefull and Irreconcilable disposition, retir'd to the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the <hi>Augustines,</hi> with an intention absolutely to quit his Relation to the Embassy, and to
accept of the proffer which the <hi>Carmelites</hi> made him, to give him directions how to go for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
and so by <hi>Aleppo</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and thence into <hi>Germany.</hi> But the Ambassador coming to
hear of the course he intended to take, sent him word, that if he did prosecute it, he would have
him kill'd where-ever he were met: which he might the more easily have effected, in that the
<hi>Caravans</hi> having their appointed places for Lodging, he might have found out a <hi>Persian,</hi> who,
for a small matter, would have murther'd him. This apprehension, and the advice of some
friends oblig'd the Secretary to intreat the Prior of the <hi>Augustines,</hi> to intercede for him, and
to make his peace with <hi>Brugman;</hi> whereupon he return'd to the Ambassadors quarters, after
he had staid thirteen dayes in the <hi>Monastery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About this time,<note place="margin">Ceremonies of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age among the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
                        </note> I went to the Suburbs of <hi>Tzulfa,</hi> with an intention to visit some <hi>Armenian</hi>
Merchants, with whom I had had occasion to make acquaintance at the entertainments which
had been made us. Coming near their Church, I saw going thither one that was to be Married<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whom I had the curiosity to follow, purposely to see the Ceremonies of the Marriage. In the
front of the Procession march'd their ordinary Musick, consisting of Timbrels, and Tabors,
and after them went a Youth of about twelve or fifteen years of age, who had a wax Candle in
his hand. The Bride-groom, who immediately follow'd the youth, was on Horse-back, clad in
flower'd Satin, of several colours, and had on both sides of him two Men, handsome Persons,
and very richly Cloath'd, as were also the other four who follow'd them, in two ranks. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them were carried two dishes of Meat, two pitchers of Wine, and so many dishes of Apples.
The Bride-groom being come to the Church, sate down with those who were come along with
him, and call'd for the Meat and Fruit to be brought and set before him; but did not eat of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Those who had accompany'd him fell to it, but eat not much, and the rest was sav'd for
the Priest, who was to bless the Marriage, save only the Wine, which was all drunk off. The
Bride-groom having taken notice of me; rose up, and taking, on his right hand, a young Lad,
and, on the left, one of those Men, who had accompany'd him thither, came straight to me, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
me, pour'd out himself of the Wine into an earthen Cup, and intreated me to drink, but
he himself would not taste of it. In the mean time, the Bride came into the Church, having,
on the right hand a young Maid, and, on the left, a Married Woman; all three with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
cover'd with a thin Lawn. The Priest, having brought them near the Altar, read several
Prayers, and blest the Marriage, by holding a wooden Cross over the Married couple, who
in the mean time gave one another their hands, and joyn'd their heads together, yet so, as that
the Bride's head touch the Bride-groom's breast, to whom, by that action, she acknowledg'd
her self bound to submit, mutually promising fidelity and loyalty one to the other, under the
Cross, that is, in misfortunes and afflictions. That done, the Priest gave them the Communion,
delivering to each of them a piece of the <hi>Consecrated Hoast</hi> steep'd in Wine.</p>
                     <p>I say, of the <hi>Hoast,</hi> inasmuch as the bread of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is not here leavened as in <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi>
and other places, in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, but is made of a paste without Leaven, about the
bigness and thickness of a Crown piece of Silver. While the Communion was administred,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47786:135"/>
they sung, and play'd on certain great Cymbals, which the <hi>Armenians</hi> call <hi>Hambarzon.</hi> They
never communicate without that kind of Mnsick, which they believe to be so much the more
necessary, in that they say our Saviour, when he was to feed four thousand men with seven
Loaves, went first up into the Mountain, where he offered his Prayers in Sacrifice to God,
and that while he pray'd, two Angels came down from Heaven; and play'd upon that kind of
Cymbals. After the Communion, they cast Rose-water upon the new-Married couple, and all
the company, and ty'd a Scarf about the Bride's right hand, by which the Bridegroom draws
her after him to the Church door, where all the company get on Horse-back, to goe to the
place where there is a Feast prepared for them. For the three first nights after the Marriage, the
Married couple touch not one another.</p>
                     <p>Coming out of this Church, I pass'd by another, where hearing a great noise, I went into
it.<note place="margin">The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                        </note> The noise was made by striking with a great stick upon a deal board that was hung up, which
the <hi>Armenians</hi> are forc'd to make use of instead of Bells, the <hi>Persians,</hi> it seems, not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to make use of any. I found that this Ceremony was perform'd in order to the Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a Child. There were in the Church, only the Priest and his Clark, an aged Woman
who had brought the Child thither: and stood in a corner of the Church, and a young man,
about eighteen years of age, who presented the Child to be Baptiz'd. After the Priest had said
certain Prayers, and made several Questions to the God-father, this latter carry'd the Child
to the Woman, who unswath'd it, and then the Priest, Clark and the God-father went into
the Sacristy, where the Font stood within the Wall, being made like a little Trough, half an
ell in length, and a quarter in breadth. The Priest, having consecrated the Water, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it some consecrated Oyl, put the Child, naked, into the Font, and Baptiz'd him, <hi>in the
Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,</hi> pouring water three several times upon his
Head. Then he poured water all over the Body, and made the sign of the Cross in his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
with consecrated Oyl. The <hi>Armenians</hi> Christen not their Children, till they are full
eight days old, unless they be weak; for in that case, they do it before, out of a belief, that
the children, who dye without Baptism, are damned; whence it also comes, that they bury
them not in the Church-yard, no more than they do those aged persons, who have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
once within a year.</p>
                     <p>The 3. of <hi>October,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal History of a Clock-maker.</note> there was put into Prison a <hi>German</hi> Clock-maker, a menial Servant of
the King of <hi>Persia's.</hi> His name was <hi>Iohn Rodolph Stadler,</hi> born at <hi>Zurich</hi> in <hi>Switzerland.</hi> He
was aged about 38 years, and had Married the sister of that <hi>Tulla;</hi> whom we spoke of before.
He had been five years in the King's service, and growing weary of being so long among in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
he was desirous to take the opportunity of our Embassy to return into his own Country.
He had, to that end, desired his Majesties leave, to depart the Kingdom, and the King, who
had an affection for him, had promis'd him a Present of four hundred Crowns, to oblige him
to stay two years longer in <hi>Persia:</hi> but that was so far from prevailing with him, that, on the
contrary, he continu'd his importunities for his departure, and, to that end, got the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
to intercede for him. In the mean time, a House-breaker coming one night into his house,
out of a hope to find there the four hundred Crowns, the Clock-maker, who perceiv'd him,
fell upon him, got him down, and having hurt him in several places, thrust him out of Doors.
Afterwards, upon second thoughts, repenting himself, that he had suffered him to escape so,
he took a Pistol, run after him, and kill'd him. The friends of the Deceas'd went immediately
to the Ecclesiastical Judge, and made complaints of the Murther, committed by a Stranger
and an Infidel, upon one of the Faithful, demanded Justice of him, and desir'd, that the
Murtherer might be put into their hands, in order to his Execution. The Clock-maker who
little thought he should be troubled for the death of a Robber, got on horse-back the next day
to go to the Court; but he was taken in the street, and immediately put into the <hi>Palenk,</hi> which
is a wooden Instrument, which comes about the Arms and the Neck, and very cruelly handled.
The Ambassadors us'd much solicitation on his behalf, but the animosity of the Relations, and
the authority of the Spiritual Judge, whom they call <hi>Mufti,</hi> carried it against him, so
that he was condemn'd to dye; with this Proviso nevertheless, that if he would be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcis'd,
and embrace the Religion of the <hi>Mussulmans,</hi> it should be in the King's power
to pardon him.</p>
                     <p>Most of the Lords, who had a great respect for him upon the account of his Profession, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was Excellent, press'd him very much to change his Religion, at least in outward shew,
and for a time, promising him those advantages which he could not expect in <hi>Germany.</hi> He
was two several times conducted to the place of execution, in the <hi>Maidan,</hi> before the Palace-Gate,
that he might see the horrour of death before his eyes, out of an imagination; that
would oblige him to renounce: but he equally slighted both promises and threats, his constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
could not be shaken, and he wav'd all they said to him, with so resolute a courage, that it
is not to be doubted but it was supernatural, and that his death was a kind of Martyrdom. He
told them, that the King's favour should never make him lose that which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> had done
him, by redeeming him from eternal death, by his blood: That being entertain'd into the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:47786:135"/>
King's service, his Majesty might dispose of his body, but that he would render up his Soul to
him by whom it was created, that he might be therein glorify'd both in this World and the
next. The <hi>Augustin</hi> Monks, and the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> endeavour'd all they could, to oblige him to
make profession of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion; but he continu'd firm to his former resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and would die in the <hi>Reform'd</hi> Religion, which he profess'd, and wherein he was perfectly
well instructed.</p>

means, left him to the Relations of the deceas'd, who had the execution of him. He among
them who went out to give him the first blow with the Cimitar, miss'd him, and wounded his
next neighbour the Leg; the second struck into the <hi>Palenk,</hi> which they had left about his
neck; the third struck him upon the neck, and smote down that Martyr of <hi>Christ,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
receiv'd three other blows, ere he expir'd; the first in the head, and the other two, in
the face.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> who, as I said before, had a great kindness for this <hi>German</hi>'s
sister-in-law, was so enrag'd at this execution, that being at a loss of all judgement, and not
knowing what to do for madness, he would needs divert himself by running at the Ring, in the
presence of two or three Gentlemen, and the Canonier, causing, in the mean time, the great
Guns to be fired above a hundred times. The body lay all that day expos'd to the sight of those
that pass'd by, in the place where the execution had been done; till that in the evening, the
Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> with the King's permission, caus'd it to be brought to our Lodgings, with
an intention to have it buried the next day. But the King having appointed that day to go a-hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

                        </note> we spoke of before, began the 17. The night before, the <hi>Mehemandar</hi>
came to acquaint the Ambassadors, that his Majesty had, for their sakes, appointed a Hunting,
that should last several dayes, and that it was his pleasure, they should have notice of it, that
they might be ready against the next morning. It was imagin'd this was done out of design, that
the Ambassadors might not be in person at the interment of the Clock-maker, but that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
not the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> from giving order that the body should be kept till his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
                     <p>The 17. betimes in the morning, there were Horses brought for the Persons, and Camels for
the Baggage. The Ambassadors got on Horse-back, with Father <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and about thirty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of their Retinue. The <hi>Mehemandar</hi> conducted them into a spacious Plain, whither the
King came soon after, attended by above three hundred Lords, all excellently well mounted,
and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mptuously cloath'd. The King himself was in a Vestment of Silver Brocado, with a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant
adorn'd with most noble Heron's Feathers, and having led after him four Horses, whereof
the Saddles, Harness, and covering Cloaths were beset with Gold and precious Stones. The
King at his coming up very civilly saluted the Ambassadors, and ordered them to march near
him on his left hand.</p>
                     <p>The other <hi>Chans</hi> and great Lords march'd after the King,<note place="margin">An Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger.</note> with so little observance of order,
that many times the Servants were shuffled in among their Masters. There was, among the
rest, in the King's Retinue, an Astrologer, who alwayes kept very close to him, and ever and
anon observ'd the position of the Heavens, that he might prognosticate what good or ill fortune
should happen. These are believ'd as Oracles. We rode up and down that day above three
Leagues, the King taking occasion often to change his Horse and upper Garments, which he did
every day while the Hunting lasted. The morning was spent in Hawking, the Hawks were let
out at Herns, Cranes, Drakes, nay sometimes at Crows, which they either met with by
chance, or were set purposely upon. About noon, we came to an <hi>Armenian</hi> Village, where
we found a great number of Tents of divers colours, pitch'd after an odd kind of way; which
yet made a very pleasant Prospect. After the King had been brought by his Grande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s into his
Tent, they came for the Ambassadors, who with some of their Gentlemen and Officers Dined
with him. There was nothing extraordinary; Fruits and Conserves were brought in first, and
afterwards the Meat, upon a kind of Bier, or Barrow, which was cover'd all over with plates
of Gold, and it was serv'd in Dishes of the same metal.</p>
                     <p>In the after-noon, the <hi>Mehemandar</hi> carried the Ambassadors to be Lodg'd in another Village,
about a quarter of a League from the place where the King had his Tents. The Inhabitants of
those Villages are <hi>Armenians,</hi> and they are called <hi>Desach,</hi> and <hi>Werende,</hi> from the Countrey,
where they liv'd before, near <hi>Iruan,</hi> whence they were heretofore translated by <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi>
to the end, that, living near <hi>Ispahan,</hi> they might be employ'd about the Vines. When they
understood we were <hi>Christians,</hi> they entertain'd us much more kindly, and made us several
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47786:136"/>
Presents of Fruits and Wine. <hi>Scferas-beg,</hi> and some other Lords gave the Ambassadors a Visit,
to be merry, and participate of a Collai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

those fallow Deer, which the <hi>Pesians</hi> call <hi>Ahu</hi>'s and some Herns, which we sent to <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
The King coming to hear that the <hi>Mchemandar</hi> had Lodg'd us in another Village, was very
much displeas'd at it, and commanded that we should be brought the same night, to be Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
in the next house to that where he was Lodg'd himself; which was accordingly done, and
our Supper was brought us out of the Kings Kitchin, in Dishes of Gold.</p>
                     <p>The 18. betimes in the morning, the King sent the Ambassadors word, that he would go
with very few persons about him,<note place="margin">Crane-hunting.</note> a Crane-Hunting, intreating them that they would bring
along with them only their Interpreter, out of this respect, that the Cranes might not be fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by the great number of people, and that the pleasure of the Hunting might not be disturb'd
by too much noise. The Ambassadors took only Father <hi>Ioseph</hi> along with them: but the sport
was no sooner begun with the day, ere they sent for all the Retinue. They had made a great
secret way under-ground, at the end whereof there was a field. about which they had scatter'd
some Wheat. The Cranes came thither in great numbers, and there were above fourscore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
The King took some of their feathers, to put into his <hi>Mendil,</hi> or <hi>Turbant,</hi> and gave two
to each of the Ambassadors, who put them into their Hats. That done, they rode up and
down the fields, and spent the time in Hawking, till that drawing towards noon, the King went
to take his repast in the same house, where he had Dined the day before, and was in a very good
humour. They had sent for his Musick thither.</p>
                     <p>At night, he sent to entreat the Ambassadors to come only with six persons along with them,
to the hunting of the Drake and Wild-Goose,<note place="margin">Drake, and Wild-goose-hunting.</note> at a place, half a League from the Village. They
all alighted within two hundred paces of the place where they expected the sport, and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great Hut built of Earth, near which they had hidden the Nets upon the side of a small
Brook, where there is abundance of fresh-water Fowl. The King caus'd us to sit down all
about the walls of the Hut, and oblig'd us to help him off with some Bottles of excellent Wine,
which was all the Divertisement we had that day. For, not so much as one Bird appearing, we
return'd to our quarters, where the King sent us cold Mutton, boyl'd and roasted, sowr Sheeps

spent some time in beating the bushes up and down, and found nothing, the King carried
us into a great Park, which was above two Leagues about. The <hi>Persians</hi> call it <hi>Hazartzirib,</hi>
that is, a place where a thousand bushels of Wheat may be sown. It was compass'd with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high Wall, and divided into three Partitions. In the first were kept Harts Wild-Goats,
Deer, Hares, and Foxes. In the second were kept that kind of Deer, which they call <hi>Ahu</hi>'s;
and in the third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wild Asses, which they call <hi>Kouhrhan.</hi> The King first commanded the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards
to be let in among the <hi>Ahu</hi>'s, and they took each of them one, Thence we went to the
wild Asses, and the King seeing one of them at a stand, spoke to the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> to
fire his Pistol at it, and perceiving that he miss'd it, he took an Arrow, and though he Rid in
full speed, shot it directly into the breast of the Beast. Another he took just in the Fore-head,
and afterwards he wounded others in several places. He never fail'd, though he alwayes shot
Riding in full speed. He was as well skill'd at his Sword as at his Bow; for perceiving one of
the wild Asses could hardly go, he alights, and going directly to the Beast, gave it a blow with
his Sword over the Back, with which single blow he cleft it down to the Belly. He struck ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his Cymitar over the Neck, with so much strength and slight, that there wanted not
an inch of his having cut it clear off. One of the <hi>Chans</hi> took the King's Sword, wip'd it clean,
and put it into the Scabbard. Then we all went to another small Partition, that was in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Park.</p>
                     <p>At the entrance of this enclosed place, the King commanded one of the two Huntsmen who
carried his Fowling-piece after him, to shoot at a wild Ass, which had before been wounded
with an Arrow. The antienter man of the two thinking it a disparagement to him, that the
command was directed to the younger, would needs prevent him, shot at the Beast, and miss'd.
The company laugh'd at him, which put him into such madness, that suffering the King to go
on, he returns to his Camerade, drew his Sword upon him, and cut off the Thumb of his
right hand. The wounded party makes his complaints to the King, who immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the others head to be brought him: but upon the Mediation of several of the Grandees,
his punishment was changed, and he had only his Ears cut off. The Executioner, I know not
upon what inducement,<note place="margin">A <hi>Persian</hi> Lord turns Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> cut off but some part of the Ear; which the Grand-Master, <hi>Mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saculi-Chan</hi>
perceiving, and thinking the man had foul play done him to have ought of his Ears
left, alighted, took out his own knife, and cut off what the Executioner had left; to the great
astonishment of all us, who were not accustomed to see Persons of that quality turn common
Executioners.</p>

                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:47786:136"/>
Within the enclosed place I spoke of, there was a little building much after the fashion of a
Theatre, into which the King brought us, to a Collation of Fruits and Conserves. That done,
there were driven into the place thirty two wild Asses, at which the King discharg'd some shots
with the Fowling-pieces, and shot some Arrows, and afterwards permitted the Ambassadors,
and the other Lords to shoot at them.</p>
                     <p>It was pretty sport to see those Asses run, having sometimes ten or more Arrows shot into
their Bodies, wherewith they incommodated and wounded the others when they got in among
them, so that they fell a biting one another, and running one at another after a strange manner.
Having knock'd down all those that were wounded,<note place="margin">Wild-Ass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>This kind of Hunting being over,<note place="margin">Presents from one of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors to the King</note> Dinner was brought in at the same place. Here it was,
that the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> was pleas'd, upon his own account, to present the King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
with his Highness the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi>'s Picture, in a Box all beset with Diamonds, as also
with a very fair Steel Looking-Glass, polish'd on both sides, and embellish'd with several Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
grav'd by that famous Artist, <hi>Iohn Dresde,</hi> and done after an Excellent way, whereof he
himself had been the Inventor.</p>
                     <p>After Dinner, we retir'd into some houses thereabouts, to take our Mid-dayes repose. The
King sent us thither ten <hi>Ahues,</hi> and a very fair Stagg, the horns whereof had twelve brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancklers:
but ere we were well laid down, word was brought us, that the King was got on
Horse-back, in order to some further sport. We immediately follow'd, and found him a
Hawking. He soon gave over that sport, and taking along with him nine persons of his own
Retinue, and six of ours, he went into a spacious low Walk, at the end whereof there was a
place for the keeping of wild-Dacks: but instead of hunting, he must needs fall a Drinking, and
was so dispos'd to mirth, that the noise we made, kept the Ducks and Geese from coming near
the place. The King did Monsieur <hi>Mandelslo</hi> the favour, to permit him to present him with a
Glass of Wine, and after he had drunk, and that <hi>Mandelslo</hi> had kiss'd his knee, he presented
him with an Apple, which is an expression of so particular a kindness, that the whole Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to look on him, from that time, as a Person very much in the King's favour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kerek jerak,</hi> or ordinary Steward of his Majesties Houshold, whose name was <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Aly-beg,</hi> who had fill'd the King his drink during this Debauch, and had not forgot to
take off his own, was grown so drunk, that, sitting at the entrance of the Walk, he made such
a noise, that the King sent one to bid him get thence, and perceiving no intreaties would prevail
with him, he commanded him to be dragg'd thence, and set on horse-back.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aiy-beg</hi> could not hinder their dragging of him thence, but they were not able to set him
on horse-back, nay he abus'd and struck those that should have done it. The King goes out of
the Gallery, and would have perswaded him to get on horse-back, but he was no better treated
than the rest, so that laying his hand on his Sword, he made as if he would have cut off his
head. The fright which that put the Steward into, made him cry out so loud, that the whole
company concern'd themselves in the fear he was in.</p>
                     <p>He was very much in his Prince's favour, but knew him to be a person not to be jeasted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and he had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so many sad examples of it before his Eyes, that the terrors of Death did, in
a moment, disperse the Vapours, which had unsetled his Brain, and bestow'd wings on those
Feet, which the Wine had made unable to go. He immediately got on horse-back, and rid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
as fast as his horse could carry him, and so made a shift to escape that time. The king who
was got into a pleasant humour, only Laugh'd at it; he came very merrily in to us; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
soon after, and we went and were lodg'd in our own quarters.</p>
                     <p>The 20. there was no hunting at all. We dined with the king, who was that day serv'd by a
hundred young Men, very handsome Persons, and richly Clad, who alwayes stood before him.
Many of our Retinue would rather have kept those Gentlemen company, and waited, than have
been among the Guests, by reason of the trouble it was to them to sit according to the manner
of the Country. This entertainment was made in a pleasant Summer-house that stood in the
midst of a Garden, upon the water-side. In the afternoon, we went to another Village, about
a League and a half from the City, and, in our way, took a white Heron.</p>
                     <p>The 21. the king sent betimes in the Morning to invite us to go a Pidgeon-hunting.<note place="margin">Pidgeon-Hunting.</note> We were
carried up to the top of a great Tower, within which there were above a thousand Nests. We
were plac'd all without, having in our hands little sticks forked at the ends. The king com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
our Trumpets to sound a charge, and immediately there were driven out of the Tower
or Pidgeon-house, great numbers of Pidgeons, which were most of them kill'd by the king and
those of his Company. This was the end of that kind of hunting, after which we took our
way towards the City: but ere we got into it, the king carried us into one of his Gardens, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Tzarbach,</hi> which is no doubt the fairest of any we have seen in <hi>Persia,</hi> where we had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Manificent treatment. As soon as we were got to our Lodgings, there were brought us,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47786:137"/>
from the King, twelve wild Drakes, and as many Pidgeons; but they were provided, it seems,
only for the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> and his Ladies.</p>
                     <p>Somes days afterwards it was publish'd by the <hi>Tzartzi</hi> or publick Crier, all over the City,
that all should keep within their houses, and that none should presume to come into the street;
the King being to goe that way abroad, to give the Court Ladies the Divertisement of
Hunting.</p>
                     <p>The custom of the Country is, that the King's Wives and Concubines should not go abroad,
unless it be in certain Chests or Cabinets, which are covered all over, and carried by Camels.
All which notwithstanding, they permit not, that, while they are passing by, there should be
any one in the Streets, or that any men should come within Musket-shot of the field where
they are, upon pain of present Death. The King goes before, and the Ladies follow about half
an hour after, accompany'd by their Women, and a great number of Eunuchs. When they
are come into the field, they get on Horse-back, carry Hawks on their fists, and use their Bows
and Arrows as well as the men.</p>
                     <p>Only the King and the Eunuchs stay among the Women; all the rest of the men are about
half a League from them, and when the sport is begun, no man is to come within two Leagues
of them, unless the King send for him by an Eunuch. The Lords of the Court in the mean
time hunt some other way. The King return'd from this Hunting, <hi>Nov.</hi> 26. so Drunk, as were
also most of his Lords, that they could hardly sit their horses. They made a halt at the said
house called <hi>Tzarbach,</hi> and had engag'd themselves into that Debauch, upon a great Bridge
which is at the entrance of the Park, where the great Lords had danc'd in his Presence, and
found him such excellent sport, that those who did best, had great Presents bestow'd on them.
It was observ'd to be his particular Humour, that he was very liberal in his Debauches, and many
times gave away so much, that the next day he repented him of it.</p>
                     <p>Some eight days after this great Hunting-match we had an example of his Liberality in that
kind.<note place="margin">The King liberal in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches.</note> For, one day, being desirous to drink in the after-noon, and most of the company having
left him, there being with him only the <hi>Eahtemad dowlet,</hi> and some Eunuchs, he caus'd a
great Cup to be fill'd, which he ordered to be presented to the Chancellor, with a command,
that he should drink his health. The Chancellor, who was not given to those Excesses, would
have excus'd himself, but the King drew out his Sword, set it by the Cup, and bid him take his
choice, either Drink, or Dye.</p>
                     <p>The Chancellor finding he had the Woolf by the Ears, and not knowing how to avoid drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
takes the Cup in his hand, and was going to drink; but perceiving the King a little turn'd
about, he rises and gets away. The King was extremely incens'd thereat, and sent for him,
but upon answer brought, that he was not to be found, he gave the Cup to an <hi>Achta</hi> or Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch.
He would also have excus'd himself, pretending he had not Drunk any Wine for a good
while before, and that if he took off that Cup, it would infallibly be the Death of him; but
the King was not satisfy'd with those excuses, and taking up his Sword would have kill'd him,
if a <hi>Mehater,</hi> or Gentleman belonging to his Chamber had not prevented him, yet did he
not do it so clearly, but that he himself was hurt in the Leg, and the Eunuch in the hand. The
King, who would have his will, finding all had left him, address'd himself to one of his Pages,
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> on of <hi>Alymerdan-Chan,</hi> Governour of <hi>Candahar,</hi> who was a very handsom young Lad,
and ask'd him, whether he had the courage to venture at the drinking off of that Cup. The
young Lad made answer, that he knew not what he might be able to do, and that he would do
his endeavour, whereupon kneeling down before the King, he took several draughts of it. At
last, thinking it too great a task to go through, and finding himself animated by the Wine, and
the King's obliging expressions, who still egg'd him on to Drink, he rises, cast his arms about
the King's neck, kisses him, and says, <hi>Patscha humse alla, taala menum itzund' Ischock jasch
wersun;</hi> that is, <hi>I pray God grant the King a long and happy Life:</hi> and the Prince was so much
taken with the action, that he sent to the Treasury for a Sword, whereof the Handle, Scabard,
and Belt, were beset with precious stones, and presented him with it; and bestow'd on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Page, who had help'd off with some of the Wine, another very rich Sword, and a great
Golden Cup. But the next day, he was so cast down, and so Melancholy, that Riding abroad
into the Country, he was not able to hold his Bridle. They put him into a better humour,
by getting from the Pages the best Sword and the Golden cup, giving them some <hi>Tumains</hi> in
ready Money.</p>
                     <p>The 19. of <hi>November,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor treats the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</note> the <hi>Eahtemad Dowlet,</hi> or Chancellor, made a great Feast for the
Ambassadors, in a most fair Hall, which as soon as a man came to the entrance of it, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
charm'd the Eye. For in the midst of the <hi>Vestibulum,</hi> there was a great Fountain, out
of which came several spouts of water. The Hall it self had on the upper part of it, towards
the Roof,<note place="margin">A Hall set all about with Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing- Glasses</note> several Pourtractures of Women, cloath'd in several Modes, all done after some
<hi>Europaean</hi> Copies; and under them the Walls were set all about with Looking-Glasses, to the
number of above two hundred, of all sizes. So that when a manstood in the midst of the Hall,
he might see himself of all sides.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:47786:137"/>
We were told, that in the King's Palace, in the appartment of his Wives, there is also a Hall,
done all about with Looking-Glasses, but far greater and much fairer than this. The entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which the Chancellor made us was very Magnificent, all the meat being serv'd in silver
Dishes. We had the Divertisement of the King's Musick and Dancing-women all the time we
were at Dinner, during which they behav'd not themselves with the same respect and reserv'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as they had done in the King's presence, when we din'd at Court, but shew'd tricks much
beyond any thing they had done before, one whereof I observ'd, which I think almost Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
One of these Women having plac'd in the midst of the Hall a Vessel of Porcelane two
foot high, and taken several turns about it, took it up between her Leggs, with such slight, that
not any one of us perceiv'd it, and kept on the Dance with the same ease, and with the same
slight return'd it to the same place, not making one wrong step all the time.</p>
                     <p>These Women are calllled <hi>Kachbeha</hi>'s,<note place="margin">The <hi>Persian</hi> treatments have all Diversions</note> and they are employ'd not only in this Divertisement,
but it any other that may be expected from Women. Those who entertain their Friends, what
quality soever they be of, will not have them want any Diversion they can desire; and the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
who are great Lovers of Women, will not omit at their treatments that sport which they
most delight in. Whence it comes, that there is no great Feast made in <hi>Persia,</hi> at which these
Dancing-women are not brought in, as a necessary part of it. The Master of the Entertainment
proffers them to his Guests, and he who hath a mind to any one of them, rises from the Table,
goes into a private room with her whom he most fancies, and having done his work, comes to
his place again, and the Woman goes to the Dance, without any shame on the one side, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
taken of it on the other. Those who make some difficulty to venture themselves with such
common Ware, refuse the Master's kindness with a Complement, and thank him for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
he does them. There is but one City in all <hi>Persia,</hi> to wit, that of <hi>Ardebil,</hi> where this
custom is not suffered; which is done upon the accompt of the Sanctity of the place, which is so
great, that <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> thought himself oblig'd to banish thence all the publick VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>Dinner being ended, the Musick and the Dancers withdrew, and the Ambassadors with the
Chancellor, made some Progress in their Negotiation, and in the mean time we were carried a
walking into the Garden, where they treated us with Fruit and Conserves.</p>
                     <p>As to this <hi>Eahtemad dowlet;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors name, age, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</note> his name was <hi>Tagge,</hi> and he was about sixty years of age, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one eye black, the other blew, a full face; but yellowish or inclining to an Olive, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high colour'd; whence it came, that he was ordinarily called <hi>Saru Tagge.</hi> He wore no
beard, as being an Eunuch; and upon that occasion we shall here give a short account of him
and his fortunes, which we think may deserve insertion in this place, though there are various
relations thereof.</p>
                     <p>Some affirm, that <hi>Saru Tagge,</hi> being yet very young, and his employment being to Copy
out Writings in the City of <hi>Keintze,</hi> he fell in love with a young Boy, and not prevailing with
him to consent to his brutality, he forc'd him. The Boy's Father made his complaints to
<hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> then King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who commanded that <hi>Saru Tagge</hi> should have his <hi>Syk,</hi> (so
they call the privy parts) with all its dependences, cut off. Others relate, that <hi>Schach-Ahas</hi>
condemn'd him to die, and that <hi>Tagge</hi> coming to hear of it, cut off, himself, those parts with a
Rasour, sent them to the King, with this request, that having himself punish'd the Members
which had offended, his Majesty would be pleas'd to let his head alone, which had done no
more harm, and might, one time or other, be serviceable to him; and that the King astonish'd
at the strange resolution of the man, conceiv'd an affection for him, and finding him an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
person, made him Secretary in his Court of Chancery. <hi>Schach-Sesi</hi> having with his
own hands kill'd <hi>Taleb-Chan,</hi> this man's Predecessor, sent <hi>Tagge</hi> the Golden Ink-horn, which
is the Badge of the Dignity of Chancellor.</p>
                     <p>The 21. following,<note place="margin">A second conference with the Chancellor.</note> the Chancellor invited the Ambassadors to a second entertainment, by
express order from the King, that they might make some further progress in their Affairs. They
had a very long conference together, after which we were treated at dinner, but not with the
same Magnificence as the time before.</p>
                     <p>The 29. the two Brothers, <hi>Seferas,</hi> and <hi>Elias-beg,</hi> came to visit the Ambassadors, who would
needs have them stay Dinner, <hi>Elias-beg</hi> endeavour'd all he could to be merry himself, and to
make others so, but we easily found it was done with some violence, and that his heart answer'd
not his outward demeanour. The reason of it we understood from his elder brother, who told
us, that the King had a great kindness for them, and did them very great favours; but that it
was a dangerous thing to jeast with him, and that he had a very sad assurance of it in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who being much respected at the Courr, for the freedom of his humour, and his divertive
conversation, the King told him one day, that he wanted not any thing, save that he was not
of the <hi>Mussulman</hi>'s Religion, and that he could not do him a greater pleasure, than to suffer
Circumcision. Whereto <hi>Elias-beg,</hi> reply'd smiling, that that might happen one time or other,
intreating his Majesty not to speak any further of serious affairs, but to prosecute his Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
There was no more said to him of it for a good while, but upon occasion of the <hi>Clock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers</hi>
                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:47786:138"/>
constancy, the king sent him word, that he should remember the promise he had made
to be Circumcis'd. He would have excus'd himself, pretending what he had spoken was in
jeast; but those whom the king had sent to him, would not be shuffled off with that answer,
took him, and Circumcis'd him by force. <hi>Elias-beg</hi> confirm'd what his elder brother had told
us; but with this protestation, that he was nevertheless a <hi>Christian</hi> in his Soul, and that he
would die in the profession he had ever made of that Religion.</p>

which the King had sent them. The Ambassadors, at first, made some difficulty to
have that complyance; but when they were told it was a custom observ'd by all Ambassadors,
and that no doubt the King would take it very ill at their hands, if they presented themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, without the marks of his Liberality, they at last resolv'd to do it, and, after their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
all the rest of the Retinue. We Dined in the Hall of the <hi>Divan Chane,</hi> and all things
were performed with the same Ceremonies as at the first time. Only this happened more than
ordinary,<note place="margin">The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the King.</note> that, while the fruits were yet upon the Table, the Chancellor ordered to pass before
the King, the Present, which he is wont to make every year once, and sometimes twice, for
reasons whereof we shall give some account hereafter. This Present consisted in twelve excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Horses, very richly cover'd, forty nine Camels loaden with <hi>Turkie</hi> Tapistry, and other
fine stuffs of Wool, fifteen Mules, a thousand <hi>Tumains,</hi> or fifty thousand Livers in money,
forty pieces of Gold and Silver Brocado, and several other stuffs and Commodities, whereof
there was such abundance, that it took up an hour and a half ere all were pass'd by, to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
into the Treasury: in as much as for every <hi>Tumain,</hi> there was a several person, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
it in his hand, in a silken Purse of several colours.</p>
                     <p>After Dinner,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors take leave of the King</note> the <hi>Kurtzibachi,</hi> or Lord high Chamberlain, came and conducted the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to the King, of whom they took their leave. The King delivered them himself the
Answer he made to the Letters they had brought him, with recommendations to his Highness
our Master, and promis'd that he would send to Visit him by an express Embassy. The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
answer'd the Complement, and thank'd the King for the honour he had done them, and
the noble Treatments they had received from him, during the stay they had made in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and return'd to their lodgings, observing the same order in their going from the Court
as had been done at their going thither.</p>

to change his Religion, they would not accept of it, and sent him word, that they much
wondred, that, it being, as they conceiv'd, his design to do them an honour, and to oblige
them by the Present he made them, he would send it by a person, for whom they must needs
have an aversion, and one they could not endure to see. Three dayes after, he sent them, by
another Man, two Horses, a Mule, and eighteen pieces of Stuff, which they accepted, and gave
the person who brought the Present, five Pistols.</p>

The 10. the Chamberlian sent them two Horses; the Chancellor, two Horses, a
Mule, and forty five pieces of stuffs, among which there were several, whereof the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
was Gold.</p>
                     <p>The same day, the <hi>Mehemander</hi> came to give us notice, that the King intended within eight
days to goe for <hi>Kaschan,</hi> and that if we could be ready against that time, we might make
our advantage of the convenience, as far as that City. Which oblig'd us to put all things in
readiness for our journey; and the 12. we made an entertainment, in order to our departure,
whereto were invited the same persons who had been at the first, save that the acquaintances,
which the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> had made in the Suburbs of <hi>Tzulfa,</hi> occasion'd his invitation
of several <hi>Armenians</hi> to this, who had not been at the former</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon, there was running at the Ring, at which Divertisement was present also
the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Agent, who manag'd the Viceroy's affairs at the Court, and a rich <hi>Iew,</hi> who
drove a great trade between the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The Walls, windows, and tops of
the neighbouring houses were full of <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> who came thither to see that
Divertisement.</p>
                     <p>The noise of the Trumpets and Tymbrels continu'd all the time,<note place="margin">Brugmans <hi>impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
                        </note> as did also that of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
which the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> ordered to be discharg'd at all the healths that were
drunk, and that so often, that Father <hi>Ioseph,</hi> our Interpreter, who knew that they might hear
every shot at the Kings Palace, fearing his Majesty should take it ill, was forc'd to represent
to him the Tyrannical humour of that Prince, and the danger, whereto he expos'd not only his
own person, after the Ambassadors were departed, but also all that belong'd to the Embassy.
He told him, that it was no extraordinary thing to see that Prince exercise his cruelties upon all
sorst of persons, without any regard of their Quality or Character, and intreated him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that there should be no more shooting. But all these Remonstrances prevail'd nothing
with the Ambassador, who ordered the Trumpets to sound, and the Gans to be fir'd as much
as at any time before. We understood since, that the King was so incens'd against the said Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
as well for this action, as another, whereof I shall presently give an account, that he
was upon the point of ordering him to be cut in pieces, and it may be all of us with him, if the
prudence and moderation of the Chancellor had not prevail'd with him to forbear, by represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to him, that the Prince his Master, who, no doubt approv'd not the insolences of that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
would be sure to punish them, as soon as he were advertised thereof.</p>
                     <p>But what most incens'd the King was this following adventure.<note place="margin">One of the Gentlemen of the reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <hi>Lion Bernoldi,</hi> who had the
Quality of a Gentleman, in the Retinue of the Ambassadors, was put into Irons by order of
the Ambassador <hi>Brugman;</hi> upon this account, that being born at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> whence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
into <hi>Holland,</hi> there were some jealousies conceiv'd of him, upon the frequent Visits he
made to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Agent, from whom he receiv'd many little kindnesses. However, that the
Agent might not take ought amiss, and the more to smother the jealousie had of him, it was
given out that he had rob'd the Ambassadors. He found means to make his escape, and cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the Sanctuary of the <hi>Persians,</hi> which they call <hi>Alla-Capi,</hi> which is part of the King's
Palace. The Ambassadors sent to intreat the King to return their Domestick into their hands;
but answer was brought, that if what he was charg'd to have stolen were found about him, it
should be restor'd, but that as to his person, it was not in his power to force him out of the
Sanctuary, though he had committed some Crime against his Royal Dignity. The Ambassador
<hi>Brugman</hi> was so transported with passion at this answer, that he said aloud, that he would have
him, and would kill him, though he took refuge and were found within the King's arms. Nay,
not content to betray this sally of his passion,<note place="margin">Brugmans <hi>insolence.</hi>
                        </note> he suborn'd an <hi>Armenian,</hi> who was to perswade
<hi>Bernoldi,</hi> to get out of the Sanctuary in the night, and to hide himself some where else, while
he sent above twenty persons a-foot and on horse-back, Arm'd with Fire-locks, and Muskets
with match lighted, to the Palace-Gate, with express Order to kill him, if he came out, or to
get him thence by force. His Collegue endeavour'd all he could to prevent that violence, and
the Kings Guard oppos'd it; but the insolence of the party he had sent out upon this design, who
did more than they were commanded to do, was so great, that, making head against the Guard,
who would have thrust them back, the King awak'd at the noise, and, desirous to prevent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
disorder,<note place="margin">The King's patience.</note> commanded that Gate, through which there was an entrance into the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to be shut, which was more than had been seen in the memory of Man; it being the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of the Foundation, that those unfortunate persons who are forc'd thither, should find
their way in at any hour.</p>
                     <p>The King was so incens'd at these proceedings, that as soon as he got up the next morning,
he told the Lords of his Councel, that being not safe, even within his own Palace, by reason
of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who would not suffer him to take his rest in the night, there was a necessity,
either he or they should leave the City.</p>

                        <pb n="216" facs="tcp:47786:139"/>
The same Ambassador engag'd himself in another unhandsom business, which was of so much
the more dangerous consequence, that all the <hi>Christians</hi> of the Suburbs were concern'd in it.
The King commands every year, a search to be made among the <hi>Armenians,</hi> for all the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
Maids, and makes choice of those whom he likes best. Our Interpreter for the <hi>Armenian</hi>
Language, whose name was <hi>Seran,</hi> a person of a leud life, addressing himself to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<hi>Brugman,</hi> told him, that, in that search, he was like to lose a Daughter, a beautiful Lass,
whom he tenderly lov'd, and desir'd his advice and protection in that case. <hi>Brugman</hi> advis'd
him to oppose the Searchers, and to call to his assistance the Domesticks of the Embassy, and
assur'd him, they should be ready to relieve him. This proceedure of his, and several other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
actions, had, at last, forc'd the King to a more severe resolution against the said Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
nay, haply against the whole Company, if the Chancellor had not moderated his
passion.</p>

that before <hi>Tamberlane</hi>'s time, it was known by the name of <hi>Sipahan,</hi> as well by reason of the
number of its inhabitants, which was so great as that, out of it, a considerable Army might
be rais'd, as in regard that, in that place, the Armies had their Rendezvous; from the antient
<hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Vsbeque</hi> word, <hi>Sipe,</hi> whereof <hi>Sipahan</hi> is the plural, and signifies the same thing as

do yet sometimes make use of, to signifie a chief Commander, or General of an Army.
<hi>Tamberlane</hi> was the first, who, by transporting the two first Letters of that name, call'd it <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pahan.
Ahmed ben Arebscha,</hi> who hath written the Life and Actions of <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> calls
this City in all places, <hi>Isbahan,</hi> writing the word with a <hi>b,</hi> and the Modern <hi>Persians</hi> always
write it <hi>Isfahan,</hi> with an <hi>f,</hi> from an <hi>Arabian</hi> word, which signifies Rank or Batallion, though
they pronounce it indifferently, sometimes <hi>Isfahan,</hi> sometimes <hi>Ispahan. Ios. Barvaro</hi> alwayes

to <hi>Vssum Cassan,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> in the year 1473. calls it <hi>Spaa, Spaam,</hi> and <hi>Aspacham.</hi>
But as we said before, its right name is <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City lies in the Province of <hi>Erak,</hi> or <hi>Hierack,</hi> which is the antient <hi>Parthia,</hi> in a spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Plain, having on all sides, at about three or four Leagues distance, a high Mountain,
which compasses it like an Amphitheatre, at thirty two degrees, twenty six minutes Latitude,
and eighty six degrees, forty minutes, Longitude; and I have observ'd, that the Needle decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47786:140"/>
of <hi>Mesanderan,</hi> the Mountain of <hi>Ieilak-Perjan.</hi> The Author of the French Book, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
<hi>Les Estats &amp; Empires,</hi> puts it in the Province of <hi>Chuaressen:</hi> but he is mistaken, for
<hi>Chuaressen</hi> is a Province of the <hi>Vsbeques Tartars.</hi> at 43. degrees Latitude, and lies at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

                  <p>If you take in all its Suburbs,<note place="margin">Its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> it will be found that it is above eight <hi>German</hi> Leagues in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
in so much that it is as much as a man can do to go about it in one day. The City hath
twelve Gates, whereof there are but nine open; above eighteen thousand Houses, and about
five hundred thousand Inhabitants. The Walls of it are of Earth, low and weak, being, below,
two fathoms, and above, but a foot thick, and its Bastions are of Brick, but so poorly flanked,
that they do not any way fortifie the City, no more than does the Ditch, which is so ruin'd, that
both Summer and Winter, a man may pass over it dry-foot. <hi>F. Bizarro,</hi> and some others
affirm, that the walls are of Chalk; but I could find no such thing, unless it were that in the
Castle, which hath its walls distinct from those of the City, there are some places, which look
as if they were whitened, or done over with Chalk or Lime.</p>
                  <p>The River <hi>Senderut,</hi>

                     </note> which rises out of the adjacent Mountain of <hi>Demawend,</hi> runs by its
walls on the South and South-west side, on which side is the Suburbs of <hi>Tzulfa.</hi> Before it
comes into the City, it is divided into two branches, one whereof falls into the Park, called
<hi>Hasartzerib,</hi> where the King keeps all sorts of Deer, and from the other, there is drawn a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of water, which passes, by Chanels under ground, into the Garden of <hi>Tzarbagh.</hi> This
River supplies the whole City with water, there being hardly a house into which it comes not
by Pipes, or so near, as that it is no great trouble to them to fill their Cisterns of it, which they
call <hi>Haws</hi> and <hi>Burke;</hi> though besides this convenience of the River, they have Wells, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whereof is as good as that of the River. <hi>Allawerdi-Chan,</hi> sometime Governour of <hi>Schiras,</hi>
built, at his own charge, the fair Stone-Bridge, which is between the Garden of <hi>Tzar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagh,</hi>
and the City, upon this River, which is as broad in that place as the <hi>Thames</hi> is at
<hi>London.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> had a design to bring into the River of <hi>Senderut</hi> that of <hi>Abkuren</hi> which rises
on the other side of the same Mountain of <hi>Demawend;</hi> and whereas, to bring these two Rivers
into the same Chanel, there was a necessity of cutting the Mountain, he employ'd, for the
space of fourteen years together, above a thousand Pioners at that work. And though they met
with extraordinary difficulties, not only in that they had to do with pure Rock, which in some
places was above two hundred foot deep; but also in regard, the Mountain being cover'd with
Snow for near nine Months of the year, they had but three to work in, yet had he the work
constantly carried on with such earnestness, that all the <hi>Chans</hi> and Great Lords sending their
Work-men thereto, upon their own charges, there was in a manner to doubt made of the successe
of that great enterprize, since there remain'd to do but the space of two hundred paces, when
<hi>Schach-Abas</hi> died, leaving the Consummation of that imperfect work to his Successor, who
hath as yet done nothing therein.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Aaly,</hi> the Patron and great Saint of the <hi>Persians,</hi> had liv'd in that time, he might have
done <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> a very great kindness, by opening that Rock at one blow with his Sword,
and so made way for the River, as he sometime did, according to the Relations of the <hi>Persians,</hi>
in the Province of <hi>Karabach,</hi> where he made a passage for the River <hi>Aras,</hi> through the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
which he opened with his Sword, and which, upon that occasion, is, to this day, called
<hi>Aaly deressi,</hi> that is, the streights of <hi>Aaly.</hi>

King of <hi>Persia;</hi> and the other, when the said City would have revolted from him, and become
Subject to its lawfull Prince. <hi>Ios. Barbaro,</hi> who Travell'd into <hi>Persia</hi> in the year 1471. sayes,
that about twenty years before, <hi>Chotza,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Giausa,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> desirous to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
this City for its Rebellion, commanded his Soldiers not to come thence, unless they
brought with them the Heads of some of the Inhabitants of <hi>Ispahan;</hi> and that the Soldiers,
who met not every day with Men, cut off Womens heads, shav'd them, and so brought them
to <hi>Chotza,</hi> and that by this means the City was so depopulated, that there were not people
enough left to fill the sixth part of it. It began to recover it self under <hi>Schach-Isinael</hi> 11. but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
it was <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> by translating the seat of his Empire from <hi>Caswin</hi> to this City,
brought it to the height it is now in, not only by adorning it with many fair, both publick
and private Structures, but also by peopling it with a great number of Families, which he
brought along with him out of several other Provinces of the kingdome.</p>
                  <p>But what contributes most to the greatness of this City is the <hi>Metschids,</hi> or their <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queies,</hi>
the Market-places, the <hi>Basar,</hi> the publick Baths, and the Palaces of Great Lords that
have some relation to the Court; but especially the fair Gardens, whereof there is so great
a number, that there are many Houses have two or three, and hardly any, but hath at least
one.</p>
                  <p>The expences the <hi>Persians</hi> are at in their Gardens,<note place="margin">Its Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</note> is that wherein they make greatest osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their Wealth. Not that they much mind the furnishing of them with delightful
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47786:140"/>
Flowers, as we do in <hi>Europe;</hi> but these they slight as an excessive Liberality of Nature, by
whom their common fields are strew'd with an infinite number of Tulips and other Flowers; but
they are rather desirous to have their Gardens full of all sorts of Fruit-Trees, and especially to
dispose them into pleasant Walks, of a kind of Plane or Poplar, a Tree not known in <hi>Europe,</hi>
which the <hi>Persians</hi> call <hi>Tzinnar.</hi> These Trees grow up to the height of the Pine, and have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
broad Leaves, not much unlike those of the Vine. Their fruit hath some resemblance to the
Chestnut, while the outer coat is about it; but there is no Kernel within it, so that it is not
to be eaten. The wood thereof is very brown, and full of Veins, and the <hi>Persians</hi> use it in
Doors, and shutters for Windows, which, being rubb'd with Oyl, look incomparably better
than any thing made of Wall-nut Tree, nay indeed than the Root, of it, which is now so much
esteem'd.</p>
                  <p>All things in their Gardens are very delightful,<note place="margin">Its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</note> but, above all, their Fountains. The Basins
or Receptacles of them are very large, and most of Marble, or Free-stone. There are belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them many Chanels, of the same stone, which conveigh the water from one Basin to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and serve to water the Garden. Persons of Quality, nay indeed many rich Merchants,
build, in their Gardens, Summer-houses, or a kind of Gallery or Hall, which is enclos'd
with a row of Pillars, whereto they add, at the four corners of the main Structure, so many
with-drawing-rooms, or Pavilions, where they take the air, according to the wind then reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And this they take so much delight in, that, many times, these Summer-houses, are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer
built, and better furnish'd, than those wherein they ordinarily live. 'Tis true, their
Great-mens Houses and Palaces are very Magnificent within; but there is not any thing so
ugly without, in regard most of their Houses are built only of Earth, or Brick, bak'd in the
Sun.</p>
                  <p>Their houses are in a manner square,<note place="margin">Their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> and most have four stories, accounting the ground-room
for one, They call the Cellar, and such places, belonging to a house, as are under ground,
<hi>Sirsemin,</hi> the ground-rooms of the house, <hi>Chane,</hi> the first story <hi>Kuschk;</hi> the second, <hi>Tzauffe;</hi>
and the third, <hi>Kesser;</hi> and they call the open Halls <hi>Eiwan.</hi> Their Windows are commonly as
big as their Doors; and in regard their buildings are not very high, the frames ordinarily reach
up to the Roof. They have not yet the use of Glass, but, in Winter, they cover the frames of
their Windows, which are made like Lattices, with oyl'd Paper.</p>
                  <p>There is also little Wood in <hi>Persia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their stoves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> I mean in most of its Provinces, that, not being able to
keep any great fire, they make use of Stoves, but they are otherwise made than those of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
In the midst of their low rooms, they make a hole in the ground of about the compass of
an ordinary Kettle, which they fill with burning Coals or Char-coal, and put over it a plank,
or little low Table, cover'd with a large Carpet. Sitting, according to their custom, upon the
ground, they thrust their feet under the Table, and draw the Carpet over their Body up to the
breast, so as that the heat is thereby kept in. Some pass away the nights also, thus accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated,
and so they procure a very natural heat with little fire, and they imagine it to be the
more wholsom, in that it troubles not the head, which in the mean time hath the benefit of a
fresh and healthy air. They call this kind of Stoves <hi>Tenuer;</hi> and that the brain might not be
offended by Vapours, which Char-coal commonly sends up into the head, they have certain
Passages and Conduits under ground, through which the air draws them away. Persons of mean
Quality, and such as are saving, dress their meat with these <hi>Tenuers,</hi> and make use of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of an Oven, and bake Bread and Cakes over them. There is not a house in <hi>Ispahan,</hi> but
hath its Court, which a man must cross ere he comes into the house.</p>
                  <p>They say,<note place="margin">The streets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> that heretofore, the streets of <hi>Ispahan</hi> were so broad, that twenty horse might
have rid a-breast in any of them. But now, especially since the City began to be re-peopled, in
the time of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> they husbanded their ground better, especially in the heart of the
City, near the <hi>Maidan</hi> and the <hi>Basar;</hi> insomuch that the streets are become so narrow, that
if a man meets a Mule-driver, whom they call <hi>Charbende,</hi> that is, a servant to look to the Asses,
who many times drives twenty Mules or more before him, he must step into some shop, and
stay there till they be all pass'd by. All the streets abutting upon the <hi>Maidan</hi> are very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
but the <hi>Maidan,</hi> or Market-place, though it hath shops all about it, is so large, that I
cannot imagine there is any in <hi>Europe</hi> comes near it.</p>
                  <p>This Market-place is seven hundred foot long,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and two hundred and fifty broad. All the
houses about the <hi>Maidan</hi> are of equal heighth, and all built of Brick, having their shops
vaulted: where you have, on the side towards the King's Palace, Goldsmiths, Lapidaries, and
Druggists; and opposite to them, those Merchants who sell all sorts of stuffs, of Silk, Wool,
and Cotton, and the Taverns where they Tiple, and sell all sorts of Provisions. All these hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are two stories high, and have all, their <hi>Eiwans,</hi> or open Halls. The Market-place is
planted all about with a kind of Trees, called <hi>Scimscad,</hi> which is somewhat like Box, but
they are much higher, and the branches being perpetually green, they are so cut, that the
Shops are to be seen between the Trees, and make a very delightful Prospect. But it is not one
of the least Ornaments of their <hi>Maidan,</hi> that the Riv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Trees, in a Chanel of Freestone, rais'd two foot from the ground all about the Market-place,
falls into two great Basons, at the two corners of it, and is thence carried by Chanels under
ground to other places.</p>
                  <p>Trades-men do not work at all themselves, but have their Slaves and Apprentices, who do
all the main work at their house's, while the Master's business is only to sell his Commodities,
in shops appointed for that purpose, at the <hi>Maidan,</hi> in a great Vaulted Gallery built with
Arches, or in the streets abutting upon it, where every Trade hath its particular quarter as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
it, or haply in a street appointed for that particular Commodity, and where they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
not the selling of any other. The observance of which order, in regard the <hi>Persians</hi> are very
neat in all they do, makes so delightful a shew, that I have not seen any thing like it. At the
end of his Gallery, there are two Balconies, cover'd over head, opposite one to the other,
where their Musick, which consists in Tymbrels, Hawboyes, and other kind of Instruments,
which they call <hi>Kerenei,</hi> is to be heard every night at Sun-set, as also, when the King, either
going out of the City, or coming into it, passes through the <hi>Maidan.</hi> They have this kind
of Musick in all the Cities of <hi>Persia,</hi> which are governed by the <hi>Chan,</hi> and they say
<hi>Tamberlane</hi> first introduc'd that custom, which hath been observed ever since.</p>
                  <p>The King's Palace is upon the <hi>Maidan.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi> call it <hi>Dowlet-Chane,</hi> or <hi>Der Chane Schach,</hi>
and there lie before the Gate several great Pieces,<note place="margin">The King's Palace.</note> of all sizes, but most such as require 36 or
48 pound Bullet, very roughly cast, without Carriages, and lying upon Beams, so as that no
use can be made of them. <hi>Nicholas Hem,</hi> a <hi>Hollander,</hi> who travell'd into <hi>Persia</hi> in the years
1623. and 1624. says that these Pieces were brought thither from <hi>Ormus,</hi> and that they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Avenues of the place; but, as I said before, it is impossible they should be discharg'd.
Nay, the Palace it self hath no Fortifications, and is compass'd only by a high Wall. In the
day time, there are but three or four upon the Guard, and in the night, there are fifteen at
the Gate, and about thirty within the King's apartment. These last are all persons of Quality,
and sons of <hi>Chans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Guard,</note> of whom, some stand Centry, and the rest walk the Round, and they all
lye upon the ground, in the open air. This Guard hath its <hi>Kischiktzi,</hi> or particular Captain,
who, every night, delivers the King a List of their names who are upon the Guard, that he may
know whom he may confide in, and by what persons he is served.</p>
                  <p>Over the first Gate, there is a great square structure, which hath large Windows on all
sides, and we were told, that, within, it was Carv'd all over and Gilt: The other principal
apartments of this great Palace, are, the <hi>Tab Chane,</hi> which is a spacious Hall, where the King
treats all the great Lords of his Court, and entertains them at Dinner, upon the day of their
<hi>Naurus,</hi> which is their first day of the year; the <hi>Divan-Chane,</hi> which is the ordinary place
where all Appeals are try'd, and where the King commonly gives Audience to the Ambassadors
of Forein Princes, as we said elsewhere; which is done, partly upon this account, that, this
Edifice having a great Court adjoyning to it, into which it looks, the King may have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of shewing the Ambassadors some of his best Horses, and his other pieces of Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
as he did at our first audience. The <hi>Haram-Chane,</hi> which is a Hall, wherein the <hi>Casse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha,</hi>
that is the King's Concubines, who are always shut up in several apartments, have their
meetings, to Dance before him, and to divert him with their Musicians, who are all Eunuchs:
The <hi>Deka,</hi> or the place of the King's ordinary residence; where he lodges, and cats, with his
lawful Wives. All these Halls have, belonging to them, several Chambers, Closets, Galleries,
and other necessary apartments, fit for the lodging and divertisement of so powerful a Prince,
and so great a number of Ladies, who are all with him within the same Palace; wherein
there is not any considerable apartment, but hath its particular Garden.</p>
                  <p>At the entrance of the Kings Palace, and about forty paces from the outer-gate, on the right
hand, there is another Gate, which opens into a spacious Garden, in the midst whereof there
is a Chapel which gives a Privilege to the whole place, and makes the Sanctuary we spoke of
before,<note place="margin">The San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</note> called by the <hi>Persians, Alla-Capi,</hi> that is, God's Gate. All those who stand in fear
of imprisonment, whether upon a civil, or criminal account, find here an assured Sanctuary and
refuge, even against the King's displeasure, and may live there till they are reconcil'd to their
Adversaries, if they have to do with private men, or obtain'd their pardon of the King; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they have wherewithall to subsist. Murtherers and Assassins participate of the same Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege;
but the <hi>Persians</hi> have so great an aversion for Theft, as accounting it a base and infamous
Crime, as it really is, that they permit not Thieves, if they do come in, to stay there many
days. At the time of our Travels, we found, in this Sanctuary, a <hi>Sulthan,</hi> who having, either
through misfortune, or his own ill conduct, lost the Kings favour, and being in fear of losing
his life, was got in thither with all his Family, and liv'd in Tents, which he had set up in
the Garden.</p>
                  <p>Behind the Kings Palace, lies the Castle, which they call <hi>Taberik Kale.</hi> It serves for a Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,<note place="margin">Its Citadel.</note>
which is the signification of the word <hi>Kale,</hi> and it is fortify'd with a Rampier, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

The King doe's not live in it, but there is a Governour, who hath the command of it, and
a strong Garrison within it, which is kept there for the security of the Treasure, the Arms and
Ammunition of War, that are within it; though all the Artillery consists only in some Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces.</p>
                  <p>On the other side of the <hi>Maidan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Another Sanctuary</note> in a by-street, there is another Sanctuary, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Tschehil Sutun.</hi> upon occasion of the forty Beams, which under-prop the Roof of the
Structure, and which all rest upon one Pillar, which stands in the middle of the <hi>Metschid,</hi> or
<hi>Mosquey.</hi> Into this Sanctuary, there got a great number of the Inhabitants of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> when
<hi>Tamberlane</hi> punish'd the rebellion of this City. For though he had no great Sentiments of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet did he discover a certain respect for the places he accounted sacred; and accordingly he
spar'd all those who took refuge in the <hi>Mosquey,</hi> but ordered all the rest to be cut in pieces, and
commanded the Walls of the Court belonging to it, to be pull'd down. But <hi>Schach-Ismael</hi> had
them built up again, and made the place a Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>Towards the South part of the <hi>Maidan</hi> stands that rich and magnificent <hi>Mosquey,</hi>

                     </note> which
<hi>Schach-Abas</hi> began, and was almost finish'd when he died, but <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi> had the work carried
on at the time of our being there, causing the Walls to be done over with Marble. It is dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Mehedi,</hi> who is the twelfth <hi>Iman,</hi> or Saint, of the posterity of <hi>Aaly,</hi> for whom <hi>Schach-Abas</hi>
had so particular a Devotion, that he was pleas'd to build several other <hi>Mosqueys</hi> after
the same Model, though much less, at <hi>Tauris,</hi> and other places, in honour of the same Saint,
wherein he made use of the Marble, which he had brought from <hi>Eruan,</hi> which is as white as
Chaulk, and smoother than any Looking-glass. But the Marble which was spent in the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the great <hi>Metschid,</hi> at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> is brought from the Mountain of <hi>Elwend.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi>
would have it believ'd, that <hi>Mehedi</hi> is not dead, but lies hid in a Grot, near <hi>Kufa,</hi> and that he
shall come out thence, some time before the day of Judgement, and ride <hi>Duldul, Aaly</hi>'s Horse,
upon whom he is to go all over the World, to convert people to the Religion of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
Whence this <hi>Mosquey</hi> is called <hi>Metzid Mehede Sahebeseman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To go from the <hi>Maidan</hi> to this <hi>Mosquey,</hi> a man must pass through a great Court, pav'd with
Free-stone, at the end whereof, there is, under a Tree, a fair Cistern, wherein those, who go
to do their Devotions in the <hi>Mosquey,</hi> wash and purifie themselves. Behind this Tree, there is
a pair of stairs, by which you go up to the square place, which is much less than the fore-said
Court, and thence it is but a little further to the <hi>Mosquey. Iohn de Laet,</hi> taking it from <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
Hem,</hi> affirms, that there is a pair of stairs of thirteen steps to get up to the <hi>Mosquey,</hi> and that
those stairs are cut out of one piece of Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e; but there is no such thing. The Portal is of
white Marble, and at least as high as that of the <hi>Meschaick Choabende,</hi> in <hi>Sulthania.</hi> The door
is cover'd all over with plates of Silver, which are Gilt in several places.</p>
                  <p>As you pass through the Door, you enter into a great Court, round about which there is
a Vaulted Gallery, and, in the middle of it, a great Cistern of Free-stone, but eight square,
and full of water. Above this Gallery there is another, not so high as this, which upper Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
hath, towards the <hi>Hejat,</hi> or Court, a row of Marble Pillars, which in some places are
Gilt. A man must cross this Court to go into the <hi>Mosquey,</hi> wherein are the <hi>Meherab</hi> and the
<hi>Cathib,</hi> that is, the Altar and the Pulpit, according to their way. As you come in, you pass
under a Vault of extraordinary height, done over with glittering Stones, some Blew, some
Gilt. It is a vast Structure, having many Neeches and Chapels, which are all upheld by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pillars. But the most remarkable thing in all this <hi>Emerat,</hi> is, that all the Walls, as well
those of the Gallery, which is in the Court, as of the <hi>Mosquey</hi> it self, are of Marble, about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or sixteen foot high, and that there is no piece of Marble, (which is most of it white and
extremely well polish'd) but is five or six foot in length and breadth, and they are so neatly
put one into another, that, the Junctures being in a manner imperceptible, a man cannot but
admire the Art of the Work-man, and acknowledge that the Workmanship is not to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The <hi>Meherab,</hi> or the Altar, is all of one piece of Marble, having on each side, a Pillar of
the same stone, which is also all of one piece. Besides this <hi>Mosquey,</hi> which is the chiefest in all
the City, and the most sumptuous of any in the whole Kingdome, there are in <hi>Ispahan</hi> many
others, but they are much less, and there is too great a number of them, for us to undertake to
give here a more particular Description thereof.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of the <hi>Maidan</hi> there stands a high Pole,<note place="margin">The Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of the Grand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

top of it a little Melon, an <hi>Arpus,</hi> or an Apple, or haply a Trencher, with money upon it; and
they alwayes shoot at it on Horse-back, and that Riding in full speed.</p>
                  <p>The King himself is sometimes pleas'd to make one, among the Inhabitants, when they are
at that sport, or sends some of his chiefest Lords to do it; and commonly, there are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
summs layd. The Money which falls down with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

foot-men, and he who carries away the Prize, is oblig'd to make a Feast for all the Company;
nay for the King himself, if so be he hath shot among them. They play there also at a certain
Game, which the <hi>Persians</hi> call <hi>Kuitskaukan,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>Mall,</hi> or <hi>Cricket;</hi> but they play
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47786:142"/>
at this also on Horse-back, and strike the Bowl to the end, Riding in full speed. They also
often Exercise themselves at the <hi>Tzirid,</hi> or <hi>Iavelin;</hi> their way we have described elsewhere.
And in regard <hi>Persia</hi> hath the best Horses of any in the World, and that the <hi>Persians</hi> are very
curious about them, they many times lay wagers on their swiftness, and Ride them between the
two Pillars, which are at both ends of the <hi>Maidan.</hi> When the King is onely a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the sport, he sits in a little wooden Lodge, called <hi>Scanescin,</hi> which is at one end of
the <hi>Maidan;</hi> set on four Wheels, for the more convenient removal of it from one place to

                  <p>On the other side of the <hi>Maidan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Taverns.</note> over against the great <hi>Mosquey,</hi> are the Wine-Taverns,

will not come into those places, which are infamous, and the common receptacles of a sort of
people, who divert themselves there with Musick, and the Dancing of some of their common
Drabbs, who having, by their obscene gestures, excited the brutalities of the Spectators,
get them into some corner of the House, or draw them along into some publick places, where
they permit the commission of these abhominations, as freely as they do that of ordinary
sins.</p>

those to play at Chesse who were Suters to their Daughters, that, by their management of that
Game, which hath no dependence on Fortune, they might discover the judgement and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their pretended Sons in Law. But these are only Fables, as is also what is related of one
<hi>Elmaradab,</hi> King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Government of this Prince was so Tyrannical, as the story
at least would have it, that no Body thinking it safe, to represent to him the dangers, whereto
his cruelties expos'd the State and his own Person, one of the Lords of his Council, named <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lometer,</hi>
invented the Game of Chesse, which, instead of openly opposing the sentiments of the
Tyrant, discover'd to him the duty of a Prince towards his Family and Subjects, by shewing
him the removals of the several pieces, by the representation of two Kings, encamp'd one
against the other, with their Queens, their Officers and Soldiers; and that this wrought a

These are seated in a high Chair, in the midst of the Hall, whence they entertain their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

                  <p>Near these Taverns or Drinking-Houses,<note place="margin">Barbars and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous.</note> are the shops of Surgeons and Barbers, between
which Trades there is a great difference in <hi>Persia,</hi> as there is, within these few years, in <hi>France.</hi>
The former, whom they call <hi>Tzerrach,</hi> only dress Wounds and Hurts; and the others, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

but there is not, on the other side, any who carries not his Rasour about him, for fear
of getting the Pox, which they are extremely afraid of, because it is very common among
them, and very contagious.</p>

of open Cloister, where are sold all the richest Stuffs and Commodities that the Kingdome
affords. Over the Gate of this Structure, there is a striking-Clock, made by an <hi>English-man</hi>
named <hi>Festy,</hi> in the time of <hi>Schacst-Abas:</hi> and in regard, that then there were few Lords that
had Watches, the <hi>Persians</hi> look'd on the Motions of that work as a thing Miraculous and
Supernatural. This <hi>English</hi> Clock-maker had met with the same fate as <hi>Rodolf Stadler,</hi> and had
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47786:142"/>
been cut to pieces by the friends of a <hi>Persian,</hi> whom he had kill'd, and the Clock had been out
of Order ever since his Death.</p>
                  <p>This Market-place consists of several Streets, cover'd over head, and is so full of Shops, and
those shops so full of all sorts of Merchandizes, that there is nothing, though ever so rare in
World, which is not to be had here, and at a very reasonable rare. For indeed, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
dear at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> but Wood and Provision, inasmuch as there is no Forrest near it, nor
Meadows for the feeding of Cattel.</p>
                  <p>Of all the shops I saw at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> I was not pleas'd so much with any as that of a Druggist,
who liv'd in the <hi>Maidan,</hi> on the left hand as you go to the <hi>Metzid,</hi> by reason of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the rarest Herbs, Seeds, Roots and Minerals it was furnish'd with. The Root <hi>Tzinae,</hi>
or <hi>Chinae,</hi> which the <hi>Persians</hi> call <hi>Bich Tzini,</hi> and Rhubarb, which they call <hi>Rawentzini,</hi> and
is brought thither from <hi>China</hi> and great <hi>Tartary,</hi> were not worth here above three <hi>Abas's,</hi> or

                  <p>There is not any Nation in all <hi>Asia,</hi> nor indeed almost of <hi>Europe,</hi> who sends not its Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants

                        <hi>Ispahan</hi> a place of great trade</note> whereof some sell by Whole-sale, and others by Retail, by the Pound and
the Ell. There are ordinarily above twelve thousand <hi>Indians</hi> in the City, who have, most of
them, their shops near those of the <hi>Persians,</hi> in the <hi>Maidan,</hi> and their Merchandizes, in the
<hi>Caravanseras,</hi> where they have their Habitations, and their Store-Houses. Their Stuffs are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
fairer, and their Commodities of greater Value than those of <hi>Persia;</hi> inasmuch
as besides the Musk and Amber-grease; they bring thither great quantities of Pearls and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.
I observ'd, that most of these <hi>Indosthans,</hi> had upon the Nose, a mark of Saffron, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the breadth of a Man's finger; but I could never learn what that Mystery signify'd. They
are all <hi>Mahumetans</hi> or <hi>Pagans:</hi> they burn the bodies of their Deceas'd friends and kinred, and
in that ceremony they use only the Wood of the <hi>Mesch-Mesch,</hi> or Apricock-Tree. But of
these a particular account will be given in the Travels of <hi>Mandelslo</hi> into the <hi>Indies.</hi> Besides these
<hi>Indians,</hi> there is, at <hi>Ispahan.</hi> a great number of <hi>Tartars,</hi> from the Provinces of <hi>Chuaressem,
Chattai</hi> and <hi>Buchar, Turks, Iews, Armenians, Georgians, English, Dutch, French, Italians</hi> and
<hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The City is supply'd with Provisions out of the other Provinces of the Kingdom. Out of that
of <hi>Kirman,</hi> there are brought, in the Winter time, fat Sheep, and, in Summer, Lambs, which
are sold at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> at nine or ten <hi>Abas's</hi> a piece: for the very Skin is worth five or six, upon
the account of the Furr, which is very pretious there. The Province of <hi>Kilan</hi> furnishes it with
Rice; and those of the <hi>Kendeman, Tasum, Ebarku,</hi> and <hi>Ieschi,</hi> though they lie at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
with Wheat and Barly. Wood and Charcoal are sold here, by the pound, the Wood
near a half peny, and the Charcoal a peny the pound, in regard they are forc'd to bring it from
<hi>Mesanderan,</hi> and <hi>Ieilak-Perjan.</hi>

                  <p>The ordinary Money of <hi>Persia</hi> is of Silver and Brasse, very little of Gold. The <hi>Abas,</hi> the

of Silver. The former were so called from <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> by whose command they were first
made, being in Value about the third part of a <hi>Rixdollar;</hi> so that they are about 18 <hi>d. sterl.</hi>
though they do not amount, by weight, to above 15 <hi>d. Schach-Chodabende</hi> gave his name to
the half-<hi>Abas.</hi> The <hi>Scahi</hi> are worth about the fourth part of an <hi>Abas,</hi> and two <hi>Bisti</hi> and a
half make a <hi>Scahi. Schach-Ismael</hi> had Coined, in his time, a kind of Money, which was
called <hi>Lari,</hi> and it was made after the manner of a thick Latin wire, flatted in the middle, to
receive the impression of the Characters, which shew'd the value of the piece. The <hi>Persians</hi>
call all sorts of Copper or Brass money <hi>Pul,</hi> but there is one particular kind thereof, which
they call <hi>Kasbeki,</hi> whereof forty make an <hi>Abas.</hi> When they are to name great Sums, they
account by <hi>Tumains,</hi> each whereof is worth fifty <hi>Abas's.</hi> Not that there is any piece of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
amounting to that Sum, but the term is only us'd for the convenience of accounting, as in
<hi>Muscovy,</hi> they account by <hi>Roubles,</hi> and in <hi>Flanders</hi> by thousands of <hi>Livers.</hi> They will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from Foreiners no other money than <hi>Rixdollars</hi> or <hi>Spanish Ryals,</hi> which they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convert into <hi>Abas's,</hi> and gain a fourth part by the money. The King of <hi>Persia</hi> farms out
the Mint to private persons, who gain most by it, and share stakes with the money-changers,
whom they call <hi>Xeraffi,</hi> who have their shops, or Offices, in the <hi>Maidan,</hi> and are oblig'd to
bring all forein money to the publick-Mint, which they call <hi>Serab-chane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is this remarkable as to the brass money, that every City hath its particular money
and mark,<note place="margin">Their brass money.</note> which is changed every year, and that such money goes only in the place where it
was made. So that upon their first day of the year, which begins with the Vernal Equinox,
all the brass-money is cry'd down, and the mark of it is chang'd. The ordinary mark of it is
a Stag, a Deer, a Goat, a Satyre, a Fish, a Serpent, or some such thing. At the time of our
Travels, the <hi>Kasbeki</hi> were mark'd, at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> with a Lion, at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> with a Devil, at
<hi>Kaschan,</hi> with a Cock, and in <hi>Kilan,</hi> with a Fish. The King of <hi>Persia,</hi> on the one side, makes
a great advantage by this brass-money, in as much as he pays for a pound of this Metal, but
an <hi>abas,</hi> which amounts to about eighteen pence, and he hath made of it sixty four <hi>Kasbeki;</hi>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:47786:143"/>
and, on the other, he, by this means, keeps the Kingdom from being too full of uncurrent and
cry'd down money.</p>
                  <p>The great Trade of the City of <hi>Ispahan</hi> hath oblig'd the King to build there a great number of
<hi>Caravanseras.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Caravan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seras</hi> or publick Inns.</note> These are spacious Store-houses, built four-square, and enclos'd of all sides
with a high Wall, for the security of forein Merchants, who have their lodgings in them, as
also for that of the Commodities they bring thither. They are two or three stories high, and
have, within, many conveniences, Courts, Chambers, Halls, and Galleries.</p>
                  <p>Among other publick Structures, we may well take notice of the two Monasteries of <hi>Italian</hi>
and <hi>Spanish</hi> Monks, which are in the most Northerly quarter of the City, and about a thousand
paces distant one from the other, One is the Convent of the <hi>Augustine</hi> Monks, whereof we
have spoken before; but the other is inhabited by certain <hi>Carmelites,</hi> who are <hi>Italians,</hi> and
though they were but ten in all, yet I may boldly affirm, that those of this Order have not a
nobler Convent in any part of <hi>Europe.</hi> Their Prior's name was <hi>F. Tinas,</hi> and he was, at our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, very antient, a good man, and of a free disposition, as were also the other Monks;
who live among the Infidels much more orderly than they do elsewhere. We are oblig'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their civilities, especially those among us, who, having the advantage of the Latine
tongue, could converse with them. We never visited them but they treated us with a Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and dismiss'd us extremely oblig'd to them for their kindness, as in other things, so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
in the instructions they gave us how we ought to behave our selves during our aboad in
<hi>Persia.</hi> They presented M. <hi>Hicrome Imhof,</hi> a Senator of <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> and one of the chief Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
belonging to the Embassy, (who is now in <hi>Germany,</hi> in a Court much different from
that of <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi>) with a very fair <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Lexicon, which he promises to publish,
with the <hi>Latine,</hi> since by him added to the other two Languages. They did me, in particular,
the favour, to afford me refuge in their Convent, to protect me against the persecutions of
the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> and to get my Letters convey'd into <hi>Germany</hi> with much safety and
speed.</p>
                  <p>At the time of our being there, they were also beginning to build a Convent for certain
<hi>French</hi> Capuci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,<note place="margin">French <hi>Capucius.</hi>
                     </note> who had bought a place, for that end, within a quarter of a League of the
Monastery of the <hi>Angustines.</hi> They were but three in all, who seem'd to be very good people,
and had attain'd some learning. They had finish'd the Chapel, and were then upon the Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory,
which had adjoyning to it a Kitchin-Garden, and a Vineyard, with much likelyhood
they would not give over building with that.</p>
                  <p>Between this last Monastery,<note place="margin">The King's stables.</note> and that of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> are the King's stables, near which
there is a pretty high Tower, which is all built of Earth, and the Horns of Stags and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>u</hi>'s.
They say, that <hi>Schach-Tamas</hi> I. having kill'd two thousand of those beasts at one Hunting, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
their Horns in that building, in memory of so remarkable a defeat, and that he therewith
made that Tower which they call <hi>Keleminar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The parts adjacent to the City,<note place="margin">His Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> are not unsuitable to the sumptuousness of its Structures, and
the greatness of so famous a Metropolis. The King's Garden, which they call <hi>Tzarbagh,</hi> is,
no doubt one of the noblest in all the World. It is above half a League in a perfect square, and
the River <hi>Senderut,</hi> which hath spacious Walks on both sides of it, divides it into a cross, so as
that it seems to make four Gardens of it. At one of its extremities, towards the South, there
is a little Mountain, divided into several Alleys, which have on both sides steep Precipices, in
regard that the River, which they have brought up to the top of the Mountain, does thence
continually fall down, by Chanels, into Basins, which are cut within the Rock. The Chanels
were about three foot broad; and were cut upon every side, so as that the water falling direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
down, and, with a great noise into the Basin, extremely delighted both the ear, and the eye.
No Basin but the water fell into it, and upon every Alley, there was a Basin of white Marble,
which forc'd the water into divers figures. All the water about the Garden fell at last into a
Pond, which in the midst of it, cast up water forty foot high. This Pond, had, at the four
corners of it so many large Pavilions, whereof the appartments were gilt within, and done
with fueillage, there being a passage from one to another by Walks, planted with <hi>Tzinnar</hi>-Trees,
whereof there being Millions, they made the place the most pleasant and delightfull of
any in the World.</p>
                  <p>The Fruit-Trees are not to be numbred,<note place="margin">Fruit-Trees.</note> and there are of all sorts, which <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> who
began this Garden, had sent for, not only out of all the Provinces of the Kingdom, but also out
of <hi>Turkie</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi> Here you have all sorts of Apples, Pears, Almonds, Apricocks,
Peaches, Pomegranates, Citrons, Orenges, Chestnuts, VVallnuts, Filbeards, Goosberries,
&amp;c. besides a great many not known in <hi>Europe.</hi> VVe saw there a kind of Grape which they call
<hi>Hallague,</hi> of the bigness of a mans thumb, which had no stone, but the skin and meat firm, and
of an admirable taste. This Garden is kept by ten Master-Gardeners, who have each of them
ten men to work under them; and there is this further convenience in it, that when the Fruits
are fit to eat, they permit any that have a mind to go into it, and to eat what they please of the
fruits, paying four <hi>Kasbeki,</hi> or two pence a piece; but they are forbidden to carry any away.</p>

                     </note> equal, in point of building to the best in the Citie. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of this quarter are <hi>Armenians, Christians,</hi> and most of them Merchants, and rich men,
whom <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> brought out of great <hi>Armenia,</hi> and planted in this place. They pay the
King but two hundred <hi>Tumains,</hi> by way of Tribure, which amount to about a thousand <hi>Livers,</hi>
which sum their <hi>Daroga,</hi> who, in our time, was called <hi>Chosrou Sulthan,</hi> and the <hi>Calenter, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feras-beg,</hi>
are oblig'd to bring into the King's Coffers.</p>
                  <p>On the other side of the River <hi>Senderut,</hi> lies the Suburbs of <hi>Tabrisabath,</hi>

who were translated thither out of the Province of <hi>Tauristhan,</hi> by <hi>Schach-Abas;</hi> upon which
accompt, it is sometimes called <hi>Abasabath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Suburbs of <hi>Hasenabath</hi> is the ordinary habitation of the <hi>Tzurtzi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hasena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> that is to say, the <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi>
who are also <hi>Christians,</hi> and most of them Merchants, and wealthy men, as the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi>
as well by reason of the Trade they drive within the Kingdom, as in all other places
abroad. They delight much in making Voyages, especially to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and into <hi>Europe,</hi> in so
much that most of the Merchants who come to <hi>Venice, Holland,</hi> and other places, and who are
there called <hi>Armenians,</hi> are of this Nation. Not that the <hi>Christians,</hi> whether <hi>Armenians,
Georgians,</hi> or others, are not permitted to live within the Citie; but their living in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Quarters proceeds from the desire they have to settle themselves in a place, where they
might live quietly, and enjoy the freedom of their conscience. For the <hi>Persians</hi> do not onely
suffer them to inhabit any where, since they have a particular Quarter assign'd them within the
Citie of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> behind the <hi>Metzit Mehedi,</hi> in a place which they call <hi>Nessera;</hi> but they have
also an affection for them, as well upon accompt of the advantage they make by Trading with
them, and the Tribute they pay, as particularly upon the score of their Vines. The <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metane</hi>
Law forbids those who are subject thereto, the drinking of Wine, and consequently the
cultivation of Vineyards. But the <hi>Persians,</hi> who are so given to Wine, that it were impossible
they should forbear it, imagine they commit no great sin, in the drinking of Wine, though it
be done even to excess, provided their Vineyards are dress'd by <hi>Christians.</hi> The <hi>Armenians</hi> are
expert enough at all things requisite to the ordering of the Vines; but they understand nothing
of the making or preserving of Wine. They are no lovers of white Wine, in so much that when
it hath not stood long enough in the Vat, or is not high colour'd enough to their fancy, they
put into it a little Brazil-wood, or Saffron, to heighten its colour. They do not keep it in
Buts or Tuns, but either in great earthen pots, or fill therewith the whole Cellar, without
using any Vessel at all.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a noble part of the Suburbs towards the West-side of the Citie,<note place="margin">Kebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> named <hi>Kebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
deriving its name from a certain people called <hi>Kebber,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Infidels,</hi> from the
<hi>Turkish</hi> word <hi>Kiaphir,</hi> which signifies a <hi>Renegat.</hi> I know not whether I may affirm they are
Originally <hi>Persians,</hi> since they have nothing common with them but the Language. They are
distinguish'd from the other <hi>Persians</hi> by their beards, which they wear very big, as also by their
habit, which is absolutely different from that of the others. They wear, over their Wascoats,
a Casaque, or Coat, which falls down to half the leg, and is open onely at the neck and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
where they ty it together with Ribbons. Their Women cover not their faces, as those of
the other <hi>Persians</hi> do, and they are seen in the streets and elsewhere, contrary to the custom of
those, who pretend to live civilly; yet have they a great reputation of being very chaste.</p>
                  <p>I made it my business to enquire,<note place="margin">The Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Kebbers.</hi>
                     </note> what Religion these <hi>Kebbers</hi> are of, but all the accompt I
could have of them, was, that they are a sort of Pagans, who have neither Circumcision, nor
Baptism, nor Priests, nor Churches, nor any books of Devotion or Morality among them.
Some Authors affirm, that they have a certain Veneration for the fire, as the antient <hi>Persians</hi>
had; but there is no such thing. They believe indeed the immortality of the Soul, and somewhat,
consonant to what the antient <hi>Pagans</hi> writ, of Hell, and the <hi>Elysian</hi> fields. For when any one
of them dies, they let a Cock out of the House of the party deceas'd, and follow him into the
fields without the Citie, and if a Fox take him by the way, they make no doubt but that his
Soul is sav'd: but if this experiment take not, they use another, which in their opinion is more
certain and infallible; which is this. They put about the deceas'd person his best Cloaths, hang
several Gold Chains and Jewels about his neck, and Rings, and whatsoever else he had of most
value of that kind, upon his fingers and in his hands, and so dress'd, he is brought to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
where they set him standing against the Wall, and keep him up in that Posture, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Fork under his Chin. If it happen, that the Crows, or any other ravenous Birds, pick
out his Right Eye, he is look'd upon as a Saint, there's no doubt of his Salvation, the Corps
is buried with Ceremonies, and is very gently and orderly let down into the Grave. But if the
said Birds unfortunately make at the Left Eye, 't is an infallible argument of his Damnation,
they conceive a horrour at him as a Reprobate, and they cast him head-long into the Grave.</p>
                  <p>There are near and about <hi>Ispahan</hi> fourteen hundred and sixty Villages,<note place="margin">Villages near <hi>Ispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han.</hi>

The fields about the City lye very low, and it seems Nature was willing in that to shew an
effect of her Providence, inasmuch as were it not for that convenience, the Country would not
be Habitable,<note place="margin">The fields about it.</note> by reason of the execessive heats which reign there. For the convenience they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
from this situation is this, that they can make the River <hi>Senderut</hi> over-flow, when the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
heats have melted the Snow on the neighbouring Mountains, and draw it all over the fields.
<hi>Iohannes de Persia</hi> saies indeed, that the River, falling again into its Chanel, leaves a slime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it, which corrupts the Air; but he is mistaken. For it is certain, that, some Provinces
only excepted, which lye upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, there is not any place in all <hi>Persia,</hi> where the
Air is more healthy than at <hi>Ispahan.</hi>

                  <p>True indeed it is, that the heats there are very great, especially in <hi>Iune</hi> and <hi>Iuly,</hi> but the
Inhabitants are not much incommodated thereby. For as, in Winter they have their <hi>Tenuars,</hi>
or Stoves, against the Cold, so in Summer, they have their Vaulted apartments, and their
Halls and Galleries, with Windows of all sides, that the Wind and Air may find their passage
in, to moderate their great heats. And though it freezes there so little, that in a Night's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

it does not make an Ice as thick as a man's finger, which thaws as soon as the Sun appears over
the Horizon, yet have they a way to make the Ice above two foot thick, and to keep it, to
be us'd to cool their Drinks in Summer. To do this, they make choice of a commodi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that is cool, and towards the North, pav'd with Free-stone or Marble, but uneven, and with
a little descent, upon which they pour the water, and as soon as that is congeal'd, they pour
on more, and by this means, in one night, they make an Ice a foot thick, which in the day
time they cover, that the Sun may not shine upon it: and so continuing this exercise for two of
three nights together, they provide Ice enough to serve them all Summer. Having made as much
as they desire, they break it in pieces, and put it up into Snow-Houses, whereof there are so
many at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> that, for two or three <hi>Kasbekis,</hi> a man may have as much as will suffice him
all Summer.</p>

here and there into several Provinces, where they are called by other particular names. The
Provinces, which have this Mountain between them and the North, are very hot; but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which have it between them and the South, have a milder and more temperate Air. The
Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> heretofore took this convenience, to change the places of their habitations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Seasons, passing away the Summer at <hi>Echatane,</hi> which is now called <hi>Tabris,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Mountain between it and the South-west, and by that means not so much expos'd to
the great heats: and the Winter, at <hi>Susa,</hi> in the Province, which, from that name, is now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Susistan,</hi> where the Mountain not only keeps off the North-wind from annoying the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
but also sends them heat, by the reflection of the Sun-beams at Noon, and makes the
place so delightful, that it hath thence the name <hi>Suse,</hi> that is, Lilly. In Spring and Autumn,
they liv'd at <hi>Persepolis,</hi> or at <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Modern Kings do still use the same convenience.
<hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> liv'd, in the Winter, at <hi>Ferabath,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Mesanderan;</hi> and <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi>
sometimes at <hi>Tabris,</hi> and sometimes at <hi>Ardebil,</hi> or <hi>Caswin.</hi> The City of <hi>Ispaban</hi> is the
most commodious of any, as well for Winter as Summer, inasmuch as being seated in a great
Plain, at, in a manner, an equal distance of three Leagues from the Mountain, there is always
some little Wind stirring, which cools the Air, and comes into all Rooms.</p>
                  <p>We had but too much experience of this change, and the inconveniences ensuing thereupon,
and found, that the heats of the day, and the cold of the nights, of which <hi>Iacob</hi> made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to <hi>Laban</hi> his Father-in-law, are there equally insupportable. For, being forc'd to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
in the night, and that during the hottest season of the year, we felt there a cold, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
us of the use of our Limbs, and made us many times unable to get off our Horses, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when there was an East or North-wind: whereas, on the contrary, the South-wind sent
us sometimes such hot blasts as was ready to choak us.</p>
                  <p>From what we have now said, it may be deduc'd, that all the Provinces of <hi>Persia</hi> are not
equally healthy,<note place="margin">Diseases.</note> and that there are some, where Diseases are much more common than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Those of <hi>Schirwan</hi> and <hi>Kilan</hi> are very much subject to Feavers; but the Air of the City
of <hi>Tauris</hi> is so good, that a man hears no talk of that Disease there. Nay, on the contrary,
they say that those who are troubled therewith, may find their remedy in that place, even
without taking any Physick. Epidemical Diseases, such as the Bloody-Flux, and the Plague,
are not so ordinary here as in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Pox, which is called <hi>Sehemet Kaschi,</hi> that is, the
Disease of <hi>Kaschan,</hi> in regard it is more common there than elsewhere, or that there notice

the <hi>Tarantulas</hi> and the most dangerous Scorpions of all <hi>Persia</hi> are most rife. The Dropsie is
not very rare in the Province of <hi>Kilan;</hi> but there are very few troubled with the Stone in any
part of the Kingdome; and for the Gout, it is a Disease not yet known among them. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
are Long liv'd, it being an ordinary thing to see persons of a hundred years of age. I
knew a Judge in the Province of <hi>Serab,</hi> between <hi>Mokan</hi> and <hi>Ardebil,</hi> who was a hundred and
thirty years of age; and the Father of <hi>Hacwerdy,</hi> who went along with us into <hi>Holstein,</hi> was
above six score. Their temperance and sobriety contributes much to the good constitution of
their Body, the continuance of their Health, and length of their Lives.</p>
                  <p>As to the soil of <hi>Persia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Persia</hi> is sandy and dry.</note> the Province of <hi>Kilan</hi> excepted, which is very fertil, it is sandy and
barren in the Plains, every where in a manner checquer'd with little red Stones, and not bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth ought but Thistles and Reeds, which they use for firing in their Kitchin instead of
Wood, where there is not any. The Province of <hi>Kilan</hi> only hath nothing of this drought.
But in the uneven parts of the Country, where the Mountains make several Valleys, the ground
is very good. Accordingly in these places it is, that most of their Villages are seated, inasmuch
as they are very Ingenious, in conveying the water, which rises out of the Mountains, by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
of about four foot in breadth, which they use in their Gardens, and many times in till'd
Lands, to those places where it seldome Rains. To give the earth that moisture which Heaven
hath deny'd it, they raise up the ends of their Lands, which are about fifteen or twenty fathom
square, a foot higher than any other part, into which they let in the water out of their Chanels
over Night, and the next Morning let it out again: so that the earth, which hath been thus
moisten'd, receiving the Sun-beams almost perpendicular, brings forth all sorts of fruits in great
abundance.</p>
                  <p>In the Cultivation of their grounds, they make use of Ploughs, which are so big in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where the soil is strong and fat, as it is in <hi>Iruan</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> that many times twenty or
four and twenty Buffles, or wild Oxen, are hardly able to draw them, and they require six
men to drive them. The furrows are a foot deep, and two foot broad. They ordinarily sow
only Rice, Wheat, and Barley. They care not for Rye, and when there chances to be any
Grains of it among the Wheat, as this often degenerates into the other, they weed it out, and
cast it away. Oats is a kind of Grain not known among them. They sow also Millet, Lentills,
Pease and Beans. They call the Ciches, <hi>Nagud,</hi> and the common Pease, <hi>Kulul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They sow also whole fields of <hi>Ricinus,</hi> or <hi>Palma Christi,</hi> which they call <hi>Kuntzut.</hi> They
beat the Grain thereof, to get an Oyl out of it, which they call <hi>Schirbach,</hi> and it is sweet and
pleasant, and very good to eat. The Peasants eat also the Grain; and mixing it with Ciches,
and Currens, they make their Deserts of it.</p>
                  <p>There is in a manner no Province of <hi>Persia</hi> but brings forth Cotton,<note place="margin">Cotton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

foot high, having leaves like those of the Vine, but much less, and shoots forth at the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of its Branches a bud of about the bigness of a Nut, which, when fully ripe, opens in several
places, and thrusts out the Cotton, through the clefts that are in the shell. Though there be
abundance of it spent in all sorts of Stuffs made in the Country; yet do they drive a vast Trade
with that which is unwrought, The Province of <hi>Kilan</hi> brings forth also a kind of Flax, the
thread whereof is very good, and fit for Cloath.</p>
                  <p>The domestick Creatures,<note place="margin">Domestick, Creatures</note> as well such as are us'd in carriage, as others, are Sheep, Goats,
Buffles, Oxen and Cows, Camels, Horses, Mules, and Asses. The ordinary Forrage for Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
is Barley, mixt with Chaff, or Rice mixt with shredded Straw. The <hi>Persians</hi> water not
their Horses till an hour and a half after they have eaten, contrary to the ordinary custom of
the <hi>Turks,</hi> who water theirs immediately after they have given them their allowance. There is
in <hi>Persia</hi> a certain kind of Herb, which they call <hi>Genscheht,</hi> which is sown much after the same
manner as we sow <hi>Saint-foin,</hi> once in seven years. It grows up three foot high, and brings
forth blew Flowers. It is cut twice a year, and they are only Persons of quality who give it
their Horses. There is very little common Hay, unless it be in the Province of <hi>Iruan,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia.</hi>
In some Provinces they do not make any at all, because there is Grass enough all the
year long.</p>
                  <p>Of all Cattel,<note place="margin">Sheep.</note> they have most Sheep. Of these they have very great Flocks, and it is their
most ordinary Food, though it be not of so pleasant a tast to those who are not accustomed
thereto. They are much of the same bulk with those of <hi>Europe,</hi> and sometimes a little bigger;
but short and flat-Nos'd with the Ears hanging down, as our Spaniels. They are but lean, in
regard the Tails, which weigh ten, twenty, nay sometimes thirty pounds, draw all the fat
out of them. The Tails have the bones and joynts, as our Sheep have, but the fat hangs to
them in great gobbets like locks of Wool; which much hinders them from running or leaping.
in <hi>Kurdesthan,</hi> near <hi>Diarbeker,</hi> and in <hi>Sirie,</hi> they have the Invention of putting the tails of these
Creatures upon a kind of little Cart with two Wheels, which is fasten'd by a little stick to the
Necks of them. The Sheep we saw among the <hi>Tartars,</hi> upon the <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

like those of <hi>Persia;</hi> but those of the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Vsbeque</hi> and <hi>Buchar</hi> have a greyish long Wool,
curling at the ends into little white and close Knots, like Pearls, which makes a pretty show,
whence it comes that their fleece is more esteem'd than their flesh, in as much as this kind of furr
is the most precious of any us'd in <hi>Persia,</hi> next to Sables. They are very tenderly kept, and for
the most part in the shade, and when they are oblig'd to bring them abroad, they cover them as
they do Horses. These Sheep have as little tails as ours.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> have also great flocks of Goats,<note place="margin">Goats.</note> and they eat the flesh of them. Of the Suet they
make Candles; and it is of their skins that they make the Leather which we call <hi>Marroquin</hi> or
<hi>Spanish</hi> Leather, and is brought through <hi>Moscovy</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> into the other Provinces of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have abundance of Buffles,<note place="margin">Buffles.</note> especially towards the <hi>Caspian</hi>-Sea, in <hi>Ferab,</hi> neer <hi>Arde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bil,</hi>
in <hi>Eruan,</hi> and <hi>Surul,</hi> where some Peasants have five or six hundred of them. They are
kept in moist places, and they say their milk is very cooling, as is also the butter made thereof.
They have also Oxen like those of <hi>Europe;</hi> but, in the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> they have a bunch
of fat upon the neck, as those of the <hi>Indies</hi> have. I have been told, that the Cows will not
suffer themselves to be milk'd, if their Calves be not brought before them: so that if a Calf
chance to die, (for they never kill any to eat) they fill the skin with Straw, cast a little Salt
upon it, and they let the Cow lick it, by which means she stands quiet to be milk'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> have an aversion for Swine;<note place="margin">They abhor Swine.</note> whence it comes that the <hi>Armenians</hi> themselves,
who live among them, seldom breed any, unless it be in those places where they live apart, as
in the Suburbs of <hi>Tzulfa,</hi> where they have some few. They conceive they have very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to have an aversion for this Creature, following the example of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and tell, to that
purpose, a ridiculous and obscene story, which they take out of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and relate;
That, one day, the Apostles intreated our Saviour, to tell them, after what manner <hi>Noah</hi>
liv'd in the Ark, during the Deluge. But our Saviour, without saying a word to them, having
taken a handfull of dirt, made the figure of a man with it, cast it upon the ground, and said to
it, rise up in the name of the Father. Immediately there started up an oldman, all white, whom
our Saviour asked, Who art thou? He made answer, I am <hi>Iaphet,</hi> the son of <hi>Noah.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ask'd him, whether he were so white when he died; whereto he answered, that he was
not, but that he became so just that moment, out of the fear he was in to appear before God, as
believing he had been rais'd up to come to the last judgement. Upon that, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to acquaint the Apostles with all that had been done in the Ark. <hi>Iaphet</hi> obey'd, and
told them, among other things, that, one day, the Ark being so full of durt at that place where
the house of ease stood, that <hi>Noah,</hi> fearing it might take in water there, thought fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
God in that extremity. The Divine answer was, that he should send an Elephant to the
said common house, and that of the Dung of that Creature and mans mixt together, there was
immediately engendred a Swine, which so turn'd up that heap of Ordure with his snowt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
the Ark went very even. This nasty Creature having fill'd its Nostrils with filth, sneez'd very
violently, by means of which sneezing, there came out a Rat, which put <hi>Noah</hi> into greater
perplexity than before; in so much, that, to be deliver'd out of these troubles, he address'd
himself once more to God, and ask'd him what he should do in that unhappy conjucture. The
answer was, that God commanded him, to strike the Lion upon the head with a Wand, and
that he, being thereby put into a fury, fell a-roaring so loud, that, out of his Nostrils there
came out a Cat, which immediately pursued the Rat. The <hi>Persian</hi> Paraphrast of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi>
going on with his story, sayes, that <hi>Noah,</hi> knowing he was to continue forty years in the
Ark, separated the Males from the Females, out of a fear, that the several species multiplying,
the Ark would not be able to contain them, and that they might want meat. Of all Creatures,
onely the Dog had the freedom allow'd him to stay with the Bitch, at the bottom of the Ark.
One day the Cat having observ'd that those Creatures had the liberty to do what all the rest were
deny'd, went, and made her complaints to <hi>Noah,</hi> who reproching them with what they had
done, the Dog would not acknowledge the fact. But word was so often brought to <hi>Noah</hi> of the
Dog's transgression, that he desired God to make known the truth of it by an infallible proof,
and that afterwards the Dog desirous to line the Bitch became fasten'd to her; wherewith the
Cat having acquainted <hi>Noah,</hi> they were taken in the fact, and found guilty of having lied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Thence it comes, that, ever since that time, Dogs have been so fasten'd in the act of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
and have an inveterate fewd against Cats.</p>
                  <p>They have several sorts of Camels.<note place="margin">Camels.</note> Those which have two bunches they call <hi>Bughur,</hi> and
those, which have but one, <hi>Schuttur.</hi> Of these last there are four kinds; that is, those, which,
by way of excellence, they call <hi>Ner,</hi> that is to say, the Male, which is engendred of a Drome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary,
or Camel, with two bunches, and a Female that hath but one, which is called <hi>Maje,</hi>
and these are not to be cover'd by any of another kind. These are the best and most esteem'd of
all the Camels, in so much that some of them are sold at a hundred Crowns a-piece. They carry
nine hundred, or a thousand weight, and are in a manner indefatigable. When they are hot,
they eat little, foam at the mouth, are angry, and bite; so that to prevent their doing any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47786:145"/>
to those who govern them, they have a kind of Muzzle put over their mouths, which the
<hi>Persians</hi> call <hi>Agrab.</hi> The Camels, which come of these, degenerate very much, and are heavy
and flow, whence the <hi>Turks</hi> call the <hi>Iurda Kaidem,</hi> and they are not worth above thirty or
forty Crowns.</p>
                  <p>The third kind is that which they call <hi>Lohk;</hi> but these are not so good as the <hi>Bughurs,</hi> nor
do they foam at the mouth as the <hi>Ners,</hi> when they are hot: but when they go to rut, they
put out under the Throat a red bladder, which they draw in with their breath, life up their
heads, and snort often. These are worth about sixty Crowns apiece. They are not neer so strong
as the others, whence it is, that when the <hi>Persians</hi> would speak of a stout and daring man, they
say he is a <hi>Ner,</hi> and when they would express a poor-spirited and cowardly person, they call
him a <hi>Lohk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth kind is, by the <hi>Persians,</hi> called <hi>Schutturi baad,</hi> and by the <hi>Turks, Ieldovesi,</hi>
that is, Wind-Camels. They are much less in bulk, but more active and sprightly than the
others: for whereas the ordinary Camels go but a footpace, these trot and gallop as well as
Horses.</p>
                  <p>The King and the <hi>Chans</hi> have many Teams of them, and every Team consists in seven Camels
coupled together. They use them at Magnificent Ceremonies, either to meet Ambassadors, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with covering-cloaths of red Velvet, or Pack-saddles made of the same stuft, embroider'd
with Gold and Silver, with silver-bells about their necks, or to ride poste, nay, sometimes
in the Wars, in which they are thus much the more serviceable, that, in a defeat, they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
much to the saving of the Baggage. They trot so hard, that the Boy who guides them, and
to that end gets up first, is glad to be ty'd to the Pannel or Saddle by the waste. When they run,
they put out their heads, and open their Nostrils, and run with such violence, that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to stay them. At our entrance into <hi>Scamachie</hi> and <hi>Ardebil,</hi> we saw a great number of
them, galsoping sometimes before, sometimes behind us.</p>
                  <p>This is one of the greatest conveniences that Travellers meet with in <hi>Persia,</hi> as well for the
carrying of their own persons, as the conveyance of their Baggage and Commodities, which
they may, by this means, transport from one place to another, at a very easie rate, and with
little trouble. One man guides a Team, or as many as are fasten'd together: and if a man
thinks it not safe to travel alone, he may joyn with the <hi>Caravans,</hi> which go perpetually up and
down the Countrey, and with these is the safest way of travelling.</p>
                  <p>The travelling of the Camels is at a certain rate,<note place="margin">Carava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

find it no great trouble to make them reach their ordinary lodgings, which are either in Villages
upon the High-way, or at <hi>Caravanseras,</hi> expressely built for the entertainment of the <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans.</hi>
Some of these <hi>Caravanseras</hi> have persons in them, who are as it were Hosts, and sell Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender,

Their sustenance is Thistles and Nettles and sometimes they thrust down their throats a
hard Paste, made of the chaff of Barley, about three pound in weight, much after the fashion of
the Loaves which the <hi>French</hi> Soldiers, who serve in the Low-Countreys, corruptly call <hi>Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destocq.</hi>
Sometimes, they put into this Paste, Cotton-seed, which is very sweet, and as big
as a great Pease. They can endure thirst for two or three dayes together; wherein nature seems
to have made some Provision against the extremity men are put to for want of water, when they
travel over the Desarts and Heaths of those hot and dry Countreys. They onely touch the knees
of their fore-legs to make them bow to receive their burthens, and being so laid with their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
on the ground, they suffer a man to order them as he pleases. The harmonious sound of a
man's voyce, or an instrument, enlivens them; whence it comes that the <hi>Persians</hi> tie little
bells about their knees, and a pretty big one about their necks, not onely by reason of the long
trains of them that go together, it being necessary they should be heard at a great distance, to
give those notice who might unadvisedly come between them, but also to divert these Creatures
in their travel. The <hi>Arabians,</hi> to the same purpose, make use of Timbrels, when they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
through the Desarts of their Countrey, in as much as whipping or beating does not make
them advance; but Musick, especially a man's voyce, animates, and inspires them with a
certain courage. What most troubles the Camels, is a kind of Snail, called <hi>Mohere,</hi> which
sometimes lies within the Thistles; if these sting them in the Nostrils, it proves mortal.</p>
                  <p>The Camels are very revengefull, and remember a long time any injury they have receiv'd:
in so much, that, in <hi>Persia,</hi> a <hi>Camels anger</hi> is come into a Proverb, when they would speak of
an irreconcilable enmity. As to this particular, there is a very memorable example of a Camel,
which, being hot, and having not the Muzzle on, bit a servant who went along by him, in the
Arm. The servant gave him a many blows about the neck with a Cudgel, which part is the
tendrest about these Creatures. But the Camel had a cruel revenge of him, ere they came to
their journey's end. For some time after, being got loose in the night, he went among the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who by reason of the cold lay near the Camels, that they might thrust their feet under
their bellies, and having pitch'd upon the person that had beaten him, he trod on him so as that
all his bones were crush'd and broken. The servant's Father demanded satisfaction, and had the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47786:146"/>
Camel adjudg'd him, to be dispos'd of as he pleasid. If anger proceed from Choler as its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
a man may justly wonder whence it comes, that <hi>Pliny</hi> sayes, that Camels, Horses, and
Asses, have no Gall. Nor could I ever find any reason why the same <hi>Pliny</hi> should affirm, after
<hi>Xenophon,</hi> that Camels have an aversion for Horses. When I told the <hi>Persians</hi> of it, they
laugh'd at me, and said, that it was not without reason Camels hated Horses; when many
times the Horses may get into the stables, and have a house over their heads, whereas the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,
which cannot get in by reason of the lowness of the Doors, are forc'd to lie abroad, and to
suffer the Horses to take up their quarters. And indeed there hardly goes any <hi>Caravan,</hi> but a man
may see Camels, Horses, and Asses put up together in the same stable, yet express not any aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or animosity one against another.</p>
                  <p>True indeed it is, that the Females go twelve moneths, but those are extremely mis-inform'd,
who believe that the Male, when he covers her, turns his hinder part to her. This mistake
took its rise hence, that the Camels, when they make water, put their yards backwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their hinder legs; but in the work of Generation they use them otherwise. The Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
lies down upon her belly, and the Male covers her, after the same manner as Horses do.
And though this Creature be of a great bulk, yet is not its generative member, which is at
least three foot in length, any thicker than a man's little finger. This animal is seldome eaten,
as being more serviceable in point of work; but when they fall under their Burthens, or in
case they be stung by one of the <hi>Moheres,</hi> they kill them, with two thrusts into the Throat,
one at the place where it joyns to the Head, the other, towards the Breast, and then they eat
them.</p>
                  <p>There are abundance of Horses in <hi>Persia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Horses.</note> most of them well made. They are very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
about the Head, Neck, Ears, Crupper, and Leggs. <hi>Media</hi> bred heretofore such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Horses, that they were all kept for the King. The Horses of those parts are at this time
very good ones, and there are of an excellent breed in the Province of <hi>Erscheck,</hi> near <hi>Ardebil;</hi>
but it is withall certain, that the <hi>Arabian</hi> Horses are incomparably better, and accordingly
more esteem'd by the King, who makes them the chiefest Ornament of his Stables. Next those,
they most value those of <hi>Turkey,</hi> though the King hath good breeding places in several Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Kingdome, especially in <hi>Erscheck, Schirwan, Karabag,</hi> and <hi>Mokan,</hi> where is the
best Meadow-grounds in <hi>Persia.</hi> They make use of them fot the most part for men's Riding,
very seldome for the carriage of Commodities, and never almost in the Cart, which, all over
<hi>Persia,</hi> hath but two Wheels. And whereas the main forces of the Kingdome consist in their
Cavallry, it thence comes, that they are great lovers of Horses, and very tender in the keeping
of them. Yet with all this care, do they not make use of straw for Litter, but of Horse-Dung,
which they dry in the Sun, and make beds of it a foot deep, for the Horses, which could not
lye more at their ease upon quilts. This Litter serves them a long time, and when it is moisten'd
with stale, they put it into the Sun, dry it again, and so continue to make use of it. With
their soft beds, they also cover them with a Hair-cloath, lined with a kind of soft coarse cloath.
They also fasten them by the hinder feet, to a stake, that, in case they should break or slip their
Haltars, they may not get away, or hurt the other horses. All the manage they bestow on
them, consists only in accustoming them to start away, as Lightning, at the beginning of a
Race, and they call those Horses which exceed in swiftness <hi>Bad-pay,</hi> that is, Windy-heel'd. If
their Horses be White or Grey, they colour the Main, and the Tail, and sometimes also the
Leggs, with Red or Orenge; wherein the <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> are wont to imitate them.
They do not in any thing make so great ostentation of their expence, as in what is employ'd
about the harness of their Horses, which they sometimes cover with Plates of Gold or Silver,
and adorn the Reins, Saddles, and covering-Cloaths, with Goldsmiths Work and Embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Yet is not this custom of so late a beginning, but that there may somewhat of this kind be
observ'd out of the most antient Authors of the <hi>Greek</hi> History.</p>
                  <p>They have also a great number of Mules,<note place="margin">Mules.</note> which for the most part are used only for Riding.
The King himself, and the <hi>Chans,</hi> ordinarily Ride upon these, and they stood us in good steed,
when all other kind of Riding had been very troublesome to us, in our sickness. They yield as
good a rate as Horses, so that a Mule, though none of the best, nor very handsome, is sold at
least for a hundred Crowns. I was told there were some white ones, but they are very rare,
and highly Valu'd; and I must confess, I never saw any.</p>
                  <p>Asses are very common all over the East,<note place="margin">Asses.</note> but in <hi>Persia</hi> more than any where, and especially
at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where there is an infinite number of them, in regard they allow not Carting within
the City. Those who drive them, have at the end of their Whip a great Bodkin, fasten'd with
a chain, wherewith they make a noise, and are perpetually pricking of this Creature, which
seems to be more cold and heavy in this Country, than any where else.</p>
                  <p>The heats are so great in <hi>Persia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fruits.</note> and the weather so constantly fair and clear in the Summer,
that it is not to be much wondred they should have such good and excellent Fruits. As for those
which are spent in the Kitchin, they are there in greater abundance, but incomparably better
and more savoury than in <hi>Europe.</hi> Among others, the Onions are so big in the Province of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47786:146"/>
                     <hi>Tarum,</hi> near <hi>Chalcal,</hi> that one of them will weigh three pound. The Cabbages are there cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
very tender, and of an excellent rast.</p>
                  <p>Their most precious Fruits are Melons;<note place="margin">Melons.</note> and as their care in the ordering of them is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
so they have every year great quantities of them. They sow them all only in good
mold, yet are there not any but what are very excellent. There are two sorts of them, to wit,
those which they call <hi>Kermek,</hi> from the work <hi>Kerm,</hi> which signifies hot, in regard they are
eaten in Summer, and they come betimes, and are fully ripe in <hi>Iune.</hi> These are as yellow as
Gold, and the sweetest of any. The other sort they call <hi>Charbusei pasi,</hi> and they come not to
perfect maturity till <hi>Autumn.</hi> These are very big, and weigh thirty, forty, or fifty pound
weight. They are kept, not only all the Winter, but even till there are new ones to be had:
and this is done with such industry, that, to distinguish them from the new ones,
a man must put his finger to them and see whether the Rind gives way; and by this means they
are never without Melons. They have a way also to keep Grapes, by wrapping them up in
green Reeds, and hanging them up to the roof of their Chambers. There is yet a third sort of
Melons, which they call <hi>Scammame,</hi> and are no bigger than Orenges; but these are wrought
or embroider'd, having amidst the embroidery red, yellow, and green spots. They are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good to eat, but the scent is very pleasant, and for that reason the <hi>Persians</hi> carry them in
their hands. There is yet another sort of water-Melons, which they call <hi>Hinduane,</hi> in regard
the first of them were brought out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> as we said elsewhere, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the description of the
City of <hi>Astrachan,</hi> where we had some occasion to speak of this kind of Fruit. It is very big,
and yet the stalks of it are so small, that the <hi>Persian</hi> Poets use them in their Inventions, to make
a comparison between them and the Wall-nut Tree, which being a great and lofty Tree, yet
brings forth but a Small Fruit: to shew, that, many times, a person of Mean Birth may do
very noble actions, and that, on the contrary, a Great Prince may do things that are poor and
unsuitable to his extraction.</p>
                  <p>They have also several sorts of Citrulls,<note place="margin">Citrulls.</note> or Citrul-Cowcumbers, and among the rest, one,
which they call <hi>Kabach,</hi> and may be found among the Herbarists, under the name of <hi>Cucurbita
Lagenaria.</hi> They are about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he bigness of a man's Head, and sometimes bigger, and have a
long Neck. They are eaten green, and before they are come to their full Maturity: for when
they are ripe, the Rind dries, and grows as hard as the Bark of a Tree, or boyled Leather, and
the meat within is so consum'd, that there being nothing left but the Seed, the <hi>Persians</hi> use them
instead of Flaggons, and make Drinking Cups of them.</p>
                  <p>They have yet another kind of fruit,<note place="margin">Padintzan.</note> not known in <hi>Europe,</hi> which they call <hi>Padintzan.</hi> They
are like little Melons, or rather Cowcumbers. The fruit is green, save that at the end towards the
stalk, it is somewhat of a Violet Colour. The Seed is round and long, and of a pretty bigness.
This is not eaten raw, because it is a little bitter; but, being boyl'd, or fry'd in Butter, it is
a delicate Dish.</p>
                  <p>The Climate of <hi>Persia</hi> is excellently good for the Vine.<note place="margin">The Vine,</note> There is no Province in the whole
Kingdome which doth not bring forth excellent Grapes; but in regard the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law
forbids them the use of Wine,<note place="margin">Why the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> drink no Wine.</note> they accordingly neglect the cultivation of the Vine. They say,
that the Prohibition made in the <hi>Alchoran</hi> against their drinking of Wine is grounded on a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which they think very good, and seems to us pleasant enough to deserve a small Digression
in this Relation. They say then, that God, desirous to comfort Mankind, especially the poor,
for the injuries and affronts, which Great Lords and Wealthy Men are apt to do those who
have any dependence on them, sent into the World two Angels, named <hi>Haroth,</hi> and <hi>Maroth,</hi>
and forbad them particularly three things, to put any person to Death, to do any wrong, and
to drink Wine. Now it happened, that a young and very handsome Woman liv'd in some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
with her Husband, would needs have these Angels to undertake the arbitration of the
difference that was between them, and to gain their favour, she invited them to Dinner, and
press'd them to drink of her Wine, which was the best the Country could afford. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
at first, would have excus'd themselves, alleging the Prohibitions which God had made
them to that purpose; but at last she prevail'd with them, and they drunk so liberally of her
Wine, that they began to be very familiar with their fair Hostess, and to desire of her the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
kindnesse it is in a Woman's power to do a Man. The Woman was content they should have
their desires, but made this condition before hand, that one of them should shew her the
way by which people come down from Heaven, and the other that by which they go up into it:
but as soon as the Angels had shown her the way, the Woman slunk away from them, and
went stright to Heaven. God finding her Cloath'd as she was, ask'd her how she could get up
to Heaven without Dying. She made answer, that it was by the information of the Angels,
and for the preservation of her Honour. Which oblig'd God to Crown her Chastity with an
extraordinary Glory; and whereas she was one the most Beautifull Women in the World,
it was accordingly his Pleasure, that she should have more light than any of the other Stars,
and so he made her that Star or Planet which is called <hi>Venus.</hi> Afterwards having called the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
before him, he told them, that in requital of the good they had done, he was content
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47786:147"/>
they should condemn themselves to some punishment which they thought proportionable to their
Sin: whereupon they went into the Cave of <hi>Bebil,</hi> between <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Betreh,</hi> where thy
were hung up by the Feet, to a great Iron Chain, in which posture they were to continue till
the day of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians,</hi> in obedience to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s command, make no Wine; but in regard they
are great lovers of it, they do not only permit the <hi>Christians</hi> to make thereof, but indeed the
chief reason why they permit the <hi>Armenians</hi> to live among them, is, that they may buy thereof
of them. They do not make it so well as it is done in <hi>Europe,</hi> and have not the Ingenuity to put
it into Buts, but keep it in great Earthen Pitchars, each of which contains near half a Barrel, as
we said elsewhere. The <hi>Seder,</hi> that is, the chief of the Religion of the <hi>Persians,</hi> to expresse
his zeal, did sometimes order the Pitchars of the <hi>Armenians</hi> to be broken. The <hi>Persians</hi> are
permitted to make a si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rrup of sweet Wine, which they boyl, till it be reduc'd to a sixth part,
and be grown as thick as Oyl.<note place="margin">Duschab.</note> They call this Drugg <hi>Duschab,</hi> and when they would take of
it, they dissolve it with water, and add thereto a little Vineger, all which together make a very
pleasant Drink. The <hi>Minatzim,</hi> or Astrologer of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> gave me of it at a treatment
he made for me at his own House. In the more Northerly Provinces of <hi>Persia,</hi> where the Wine
is not very good, the Inhabitants dissolve the <hi>Duschab</hi> in the Country Wine, whereto they by
that means give both the Colour and Tast of Sack.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes they boyl the <hi>Duschab</hi> so long, that they reduce it into a Paste, for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of Travellers, who cut it with a Knife, and dissolve it in water. At <hi>Tabris,</hi> they make
a certain Conserve of it,<note place="margin">Helwa.</note> which they call <hi>Helwa,</hi> mixing therewith beaten Almonds, Flower,
and peel'd Filbeards or small Nuts. They put this mixture into a long and narrow Bag, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
set in under the press, they make of it a Paste, which grows so hard, that a man must have
a Hatchet to cut it. They make also a kind of Conserve of it, much like a Pudding, which
they call <hi>Zutzuch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zutzuch.</note> thrusting through the middle of it a small Cotton thread to keep the Paste
together.</p>
                  <p>There are some Chymists, who maintain that by the same reason, to prevent the charges
arising upon the transportation of Wine, it were possible to reduce five Tuns to one, by causing
sweet Wine to be boyl'd away to the fifth part. For, as they say, there is no likelyhood the
Wine should lose ought of its Spirits, before it hath wrought, and is dispos'd into Vessels, and
that afterwards adding thereto as much fair water, out of which the superfluous humour hath
been evaporated, it might be restor'd to the same quantity, and reduc'd to the same degree of
goodness it had been of before. But I am of opinion, that if this were feasible, the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had been long since try'd, especially in <hi>France,</hi> instead of turning Wine into Aquavitae.</p>
                  <p>There are two sorts of Grapes in <hi>Persia,</hi> but the best and sweetest are at <hi>Schiras,</hi> and <hi>Tabris;</hi>
whence they bestow on the most delicate of them the name of <hi>Tabersch.</hi> This Grape is long, and
hath no stone, and it may be kept all Winter. Those which they call <hi>Keseki,</hi> are yellowish
and sweet, and grow in <hi>Tarum,</hi> at <hi>Tabris,</hi> and at <hi>Ordebath:</hi> but of these a man must eat spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly,
for fear of a Bloody-Flux.</p>
                  <p>The small Grapes, which we call Currens, are there yellowish, and bigger than those which
grow in the Isle of <hi>Zanthe.</hi> They call them <hi>Kischmisch,</hi> and the best of them grow at <hi>Bawanat,</hi>
near <hi>Herat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides these, there are yet several other sorts of Grapes, not known in <hi>Europe;</hi> among the
rest, those which they call <hi>Hallague.</hi> The Grape it self is above an inch and a half thick, but
the meat of it is hard, juyce-less, and without stones, and they are kept all the year long: as
also the <hi>Enkuri Alideresi,</hi> the bunch whereof is above a foot long, and the Grapes are about
the bigness of a Damasin, of a dark red Colour, full of juyce and very sweet; but they will not
keep. There does not grow any of these save at one place, in the Province of <hi>Iran,</hi> between
<hi>Ordabath</hi> and <hi>Choddaserin</hi> They derive their name from their great Prophet <hi>Aly,</hi> who being,
one day, in Winter, at that place, desired a Vinedresser, whom he met, to give him some
Grapes; whereto the other making answer, that it were impossible to satisfie his desire, in that
season, <hi>Aly</hi> bid him go into the next Vineyard, and he should find some. He went, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he had said, found the fairest Grapes he had ever seen; upon which occasion, they
are called <hi>Enkuri Aly deresi,</hi> that is, the Grapes of the little Valley of <hi>Aly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no Fruit-Tree in <hi>Europe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fruit-Trees.</note> but is to be found in <hi>Persia;</hi> but, besides those, they have
many, not known to us; as a sort of Pears, which they call <hi>Melletze,</hi> which grow near the
City of <hi>Ordebath,</hi> about the bigness, and much of the colour of Citrons. The scent of them
is very sweet and pleasant, and they are very juicy, but not delighfull to the tast.</p>
                  <p>Pomegranate-Trees, Almond-Trees, and Fig-Trees grow there without any ordering or
cultivation, especially in the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> where you have whole Forests of them. The
wild Pomegranates, which you find almost every where, especially at <hi>Karabag,</hi> are sharp or
sowrish. They take out of them the Seed, which they call <hi>Nardan,</hi> wherewith they drive a
great Trade, and the <hi>Persians</hi> make use of it in their sawces, whereto it gives a colour, and a
picquant tast, having been steep'd in water, and strain'd through a cloath. Sometimes they boyl
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47786:147"/>
the juyce of these Pomegranates, and keep it to give a colour co the Rice; which they serve
up at their entertainments, and it gives it withall a tast which is not unpleasant. The <hi>Persians</hi>
use sharp sawces with most of their meat, and thence it comes, that among them, you very
seldome find any person troubled with the Scurvy, which is a Disease, too well known, and
mortal in several Provinces of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall say nothing of those other Fruits, which we have also in <hi>Europe,</hi> as of their <hi>Narintz,</hi>
or Orenges, <hi>Limec,</hi> Citrons, <hi>Meschmeschi,</hi> Apricocks, <hi>Scafralu,</hi> Peaches, &amp;c. only thus much,
that they are not equally good every where. The best Pomegranates grow in <hi>Iescht,</hi> and at
<hi>Caswin,</hi> but the biggest, in <hi>Karabag. Ispahan</hi> is famous for its good Melons; <hi>Caswin,</hi> for
its Peaches; <hi>Tabris,</hi> for its Apricocks; and the Provinces of <hi>Kilan</hi> and <hi>Lahetzan</hi> for Silks.</p>
                  <p>The Trees out of which they get this rich Commodity,<note place="margin">Silk</note> may, no doubt, be very well num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among the Fruit-Trees, not only in regard that it is true they bear Fruit, but also upon
this score, that the <hi>Persians</hi> every where fill their Gardens with these plants. They are white
and black Mulbery-Trees, which they plant so close one by another, that a man can hardly
pass between the Trees, but they order them as Bushes, and suffer them not to grow above five
foot and a half high, that they may easily reach to all the Branches. In the Spring, as soon as
these Trees begin to shoot forth their leaves, the <hi>Persians</hi> begin to hatch their Silk-worms. To
do this, they carry the Seed in a little bag under the arm pit, where the heat of seven or eight
daies hatches them. Then they put them into a wooden dish, upon the Mulbery-leaves, which
they change at least once a day, having a great care that they be not wet. At the end of five
dayes, they sleep three, and then, they dispose them into Rooms, or Barns; kept very clean
and prepar'd for that purpose, and in the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> they have particular Buildings for
that end. Along the beams of these Buildings they nail laths, or cleft pieces, such as Hoops
are made of, upon which they lay the Mulbery-branches with the leaves on, and put the
Worms upon them, every day changing these branches, and at last, when they are grown
pretty big, twice or thrice a day; and they so shut all ouvertures of the Barns, which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Nets, that the very Birds cannot get in to eat them. In the mean time, and before
they begin to spin, they sleep eight dayes more; but there must be a great care taken, that
Women troubled with their Monethly infirmity, come not near them; inasmuch as it would
kill them, and as it were smother them in their own moisture. After seven weeks life, they
begin to spin, which is known as well by their satiety, in regard they then give over eating, as
by the Silk which comes out at their Mouths. They suffer them to work twelve dayes at their
God, and in the mean time they very carefully watch the place where they spin. That time
expir'd, they find as many Cods, as there had been Worms, and they make choice of the
biggest for the Seed. All the rest is cast into a Kettle of boyling water, into which they ever
and anon put a Besom, made for that purpose, whereto the Silk sticks, and they immediately
wind it up, and what remains they cast away. That which is kept for Seed they set upon a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
out of which, about fifteen dayes after there are hatched Butter-flies, and these produce
the Seed, which is kept in a temperate place till the year following. In this Commodity of Silk
consists the greatest Trade of all <hi>Persia,</hi> nay in a manner af all the East, as it is, in effect, the
Richest and most Noble of any that is driven in <hi>Europe.</hi>

which is so scarce thereabouts, that the advantage might be made of them would not defray the

                     <hi>Xenophon</hi> saies, that they were most of them bulky and fat:
and <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> on the contrary, affirms, that, in his time, they were spare-bodied, and
dry. They are so now, but strong, and have great limbs, their faces inclining to an Olive-colour,
Black-hair'd, and Hawk-nos'd. The men are shav'd once in eight dayes, contrary to
the custom of the antient <hi>Persians,</hi> who suffered their Hair to grow, as do at present the <hi>Seid,</hi>
that is, the kinred of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who, as they say, went so. They also shave their Beards,
leaving only Mustachoes. They are only a sort of Religious men, called <hi>Pyhr,</hi> who suffer
their Beards to grow upon their Chins, and about their Cheeks. These people are in great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
among them, upon the accompt of their apparent sanctity, which principally consists
in abstinence. There are also those, who never cut their Mustachoes, which by that means cover
their Mouths; and this they do in remembrance of their Prophet <hi>Haly,</hi> who wore them in
that manner. These last are called <hi>Suffi;</hi> and they say <hi>Haly</hi> wore his Mustachoes so, for the
following reason: That when <hi>Mahomet</hi> took that Voyage to Paradise, which the <hi>Alchoran</hi>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:47786:148"/>
speaks of, <hi>Azoara, 27. Haly</hi> follow'd him. At first they made some difficulty at the Gate to
let him in, till such time as he told the Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ter, that he was <hi>Schir Chodda,</hi> that is, God's Lion.
Being got in, he saw that the Angels made <hi>Mahomet</hi> drink of a certain excellent Wine,
whereof he was so happy as to have one Goblet presented to him, which he took off; but some
drops of the Divine draught sticking on his Mustachoes, he would never afterwards suffer them
to be cut.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> have a great fancy to black hair, and they bear with the flaxen-hair'd, but not
without some trouble; but for red-hair'd people, they have a strong aversion. They have so
great an esteem for black hair, that when it is not fully black, they colour it so. To do that,
they make use of the herb and seed of <hi>Wesme,</hi> which is brought from <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and is somewhat
like that which the <hi>Herbarists</hi> call <hi>Securidaca,</hi> which they beat very small with the rinds of
Pomegranates, and mix therewith Soap and Arsenick; they boyl this composition in Spring-water,
and rub their Hair therewith, which they afterwards wash with a strong lye, made with
unslak'd Lime. They make use also of the water, which issues out of the Vines, in the Spring-time:
the Men rub their Mustachoes therewith, and Maids their Hair, which fall down over
their shoulders ty'd up in several tresses; out of an opinion they all are of that this makes them
grow.</p>
                  <p>They have also a custom of Painting their Hands,<note place="margin">Paint their Hands and Nails.</note> and, above all, their Nails, with a Red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
inclining to Yellowish or Orenge, much near the colour that our Tanners nails are of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
There are those who also Paint their Feet. This is so necessary an ornament in their Married
Women, that this kind of Paint is brought up, and distributed among those that are invited to
their Wedding Dinners. They therewith Paint also the Bodies of such as dye Maids, that when
they appear before the Angels Examinants, they may be found more neat and handsome. This
Colour is made of the herb, which they call <hi>Chinne,</hi> which hath leaves like those of Liquorice,
or rather those of Myrele. It grows in the Province of <hi>Erak,</hi> and it is dry'd, and beaten, small as
Flower, and there is put thereto a little of the juyce of sowr Pomegranate, or Citron, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
only fair Water; and therewith they Colour their hands. And if they would have them
to be of a darker Colour, they rub them afterwards with Wall-nut leaves. This colour will
not be got off in fifteen dayes, though they wash their hands several times a day.</p>
                  <p>Their Cloaths have no proportion to their Limbs.<note place="margin">Their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</note> Their Coats and upper Garments are
large and hang loose, not unlike the Garments of Women. They express a certain Effeminacy
in their gate. They go as it were Jetting and Wadling, and with very little Gravity. I am of
opinion, that this scurvy Habit is deriv'd from their manner of sitting, which is, as our Taylors
do; whereto being accustomed from their infancy, they are not so strong in the Hamms as they
would otherwise be. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ascribes the invention of this kind of Garments to <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis,</hi>
and tells the occasion of it, as do also most of the other antient Authors. The <hi>Coeffure</hi>
of the men, which they call <hi>Mendils,</hi> and the <hi>Turks, Tulbans</hi> or <hi>Turbants,</hi> is made of Cotton
cloath, or some Silk stuff, that is very fine, and of several Colo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs, and being about eight or
nine Ells in length, comes many times about their Heads, having the folds slightly sow'd, or
drawn with a Gold thread. Those of their Priests, and particularly, of the <hi>Hasis,</hi> is white, as
are also all their Garments. There are some put to their <hi>Mendils</hi> a tassel of Silk, which hangs
down their backs, or over their shoulders, a quarter of an Ell or better in length. The <hi>Seid,</hi>
that is, those who pretend to be of the Posterity of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and assume the title of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
have their <hi>Mendils</hi> of green silk. Some <hi>Persians,</hi> even of the greatest of the Kingdome,
wear furr'd Caps, the inside and outside being of <hi>Buchar</hi> Sheep skin, so as that the Wool hangs
down from the edges the length of a man's finger, and is as soft as Silk. These Caps are esteem'd
in <hi>Persia</hi> as the Castors are in <hi>Europe,</hi> and are sold at ten or twelve Crowns a piece. They wear
these about their Heads, in Summer as well as VVinter, though a man might think, that, by
reason of the extreme sultriness of the weather, they should be very troublesome and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious.
This custom of keeping their Heads alwayes very hot, brings them to that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that they dare not expose them to the Cold, no not in calm weather. To this purpose I
conceive I may allege what <hi>Herodotus</hi> sayes;<note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> to wit, that, after a fight between the <hi>Persians</hi>
and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> where there fell a great number of men on both sides, care was taken that
the Bodies of both parties were dispos'd into several places, and it was found, some time after,
that the Skuls of the <hi>Persians,</hi> were so thin and delicate, that a man might thrust his finger into
them, and that, on the contrary, those of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were so hard, that they could not be
broken with stones. The reason he gives for it, is, that he sayes, the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
from their infancy to go bare-headed in the Sun, were by that means grown hard,
whereas the <hi>Persians,</hi> having their Heads alwayes wrapp'd about, were very tender in their
Skuls. And indeed they never uncover them, neither at their Devotions, nor when they Salute
other men, no, not when they speak to their King: but when they salute any, they do it by a
low inclination of the Head, and putting of their hand to their Breast.</p>
                  <p>Many of the <hi>Persians</hi> wear Red Caps,<note place="margin">Kisilbaschs</note> whence the <hi>Turks</hi> take occasion, to call them, by way
of derision, <hi>Kisilbaschs,</hi> that is to say <hi>Red-Heads.</hi> Most Authors, who treat of the affairs of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47786:148"/>
                     <hi>Persia,</hi> write this word <hi>Cuselbas, Queselbach,</hi> or <hi>Querselbach;</hi> but the right name is <hi>Kisilbasch,</hi>
as being compounded of the word <hi>Kisil,</hi> which hath two different significations, to wit, that
of <hi>Red,</hi> and of <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Basch,</hi> which signifies a <hi>Head. Paulus Iovius,</hi> in the 13. Book of his
<hi>Histories,</hi> and, after him, <hi>F. Bizarro,</hi> in the 10. Book of his <hi>History of Persia,</hi> affirm; that
<hi>Tefellis,</hi> Disciple of <hi>Harduellis,</hi> otherwise named <hi>Eider,</hi> who, as they say, liv'd about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the sixteenth age, was the first who brought the <hi>Persians</hi> to wear Red Caps, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
them from the <hi>Turks,</hi> at their separation from them in the business of Religion. But
they are both mistaken: for the truth is, that the <hi>Persians,</hi> when they broke Communion with
the <hi>Turks,</hi> and made a particular Sect of the <hi>Mahumetane</hi> Religion, by the advice of <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi>
the Author of their new Opinions, immediately held, that the first Successors of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,
Omar, Osman,</hi> and <hi>Ababeker,</hi> had usurp'd the Succession, to the prejudice of <hi>Aaly</hi>'s
right, and would have this last to be accounted the Propher, and that his twelve Successors,
whom we shall name hereafter, when we come to speak of the Religion of the <hi>Persians,</hi> were
Canoniz'd, and put into the number of their <hi>Imans,</hi> or Saints; that they were look'd upon as
having that quality, and that their Ecclesiasticks or Religious men wore Red Caps, made with
twelve foldings, in form much like the Bottles used in <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> which have great
and flat Bellies, and very long and narrow Necks.</p>
                  <p>This difference in matter of Religion, occasion'd a great War between the two Nations,
wherein the <hi>Turks,</hi> making advantage of their Arms, were very cruel towards the <hi>Persians,</hi>
but especially the Ecclesiasticks, by reason of the aversion which they had for that new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And in regard their Coiffure, or what they wore about their Heads, distinguish them
from the others, they left off their Caps in several places of the Kingdom, and oblig'd the rest to
follow their example. This persecution lasted, till <hi>Schach-Ismael</hi> l. finding himself forc'd by
the <hi>Turks</hi> to retreat into the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> and having some reason to fear, that, within a
short time, he might see the whole Kingdom in the hands of the profess'd enemies of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
resolv'd to meet them, and to put all to the hazard of a Battel. To this end, he sent
Persons to represent to the Provinces and the chief Cities of the Kingdom, the danger, whereto
the State, their Liberties, and Religion were expos'd, if they resolv'd not to make what oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
they could in that extremity against the <hi>Turk,</hi> sending them word, that he would grant
those who should serve him in Person, in that Conjuncture of affairs, a general and perpetual
Exemption, for them and their Posterity. By this means, he got together an Army of three
hundred thousand fighting men, wherewith he march'd directly to <hi>Ardebil,</hi> as desirous to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
his Exploits by a pious Enterprize, in recovering the Sepulchre of <hi>Schich-Sefi</hi> out of the
hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were forc'd out of that City. He was no sooner become Master of
it, but he confirm'd all he had promis'd touching the Exemption, and to the end those might
be known who were to enjoy the benefit of it, he ordered the making of these Red Caps, which
were done with Twelve foldings, in remembrance of their Twelve <hi>Imans.</hi> But in regard the
City was not able to find Scarlet enough, for so great a number of Caps, a Shooe-maker of
<hi>Ardebil</hi> would needs make twelve of them, of <hi>Maroquin,</hi> or Goats Leather, of the same
Colour, which <hi>Schach-Ismael</hi> presented to the chief Commanders of his Army. He ordered
them to be Red, to make a certain representation of the Crown of <hi>Aaly,</hi> whom the <hi>Persians</hi>
give the quality of King, as well as of Prophet, as they do these Caps the name of <hi>Tatsch,</hi> that
is to say, a Crown. Whence it comes, that the <hi>Persians</hi> are so far from taking it ill, that they
are called <hi>Kisilbasks,</hi> that they think it an honour done them, though, in effect, only those of
the Posterity of <hi>Aaly,</hi> and these exempted Persons, wear red Caps: the former having them
cover'd with Linnen Cloath, or some other kind of Stuff, and the others without any thing at
all about them. The Posterity of these exempted Persons do still enjoy these Privileges, and
out of them is chosen the Guard for the King's Person, as being look'd upon, as the <hi>Swizzers</hi>
are in the Courts of diverse Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their ordinary Habit are a kind of sleeveless Coats of Cotton, or Silk, of several Colours,
which come down to the calves of their Legs. Those of Cotton have flowers printed upon the
Cloath, and are quilted, as Mattresses. They draw the sides of them together, under the left
arm, and gird themselves with a Skarf about two Ells in length, called <hi>Tzarkesi,</hi> which comes
several times about the Body. The richer sort have, upon this, another rich Skarf, which they
call <hi>Schal,</hi> made of a very fine stuff, brought by the <hi>Indians</hi> into <hi>Persia:</hi> for their Silk being
much fairer, and their Colours more lively and finer, than those of <hi>Persia,</hi> their Stuffs are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
more highly esteem'd.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Mollas,</hi> or Priests come before the <hi>Mchere,</hi> they take off that rich Skarf, to
express their Humility. The other <hi>Persians</hi> wear in it a Ponyard, their Knives, their Handker-chiefs,
and their Money; and those, whose profession it is to write for others, carry in them
their Ink-horns, a Pen-knife, and a little Whet-stone, Letters, and all that the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
are wont to thrust into their Boots or Buskins, which serve them instead of Pockets. Persons
of quality, and the King himself, wear, over this Coat, a kind of Rocket, without sleeves,
which reaches but to the Waste, border'd with Sables. When they go abroad, whether a-foot,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47786:149"/>
or on horse-back, they cast over these, a silk Garment of diverse Colours, or wrought with
Gold flowers, which they call <hi>Iakub Cahni,</hi> from a King, of that name, who was the first
that ever wore them in <hi>Persia.</hi> Their Breeches are of Cotton, made after the fashion of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers;
accordingly they wear them under their shirts, and they reach down to their feet. Their
Shirts are of Cotton Cloath, and for the most streak'd with Red. Their Stockings are of Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Cloath, unhandsomely cut out, without any shape, or any proportion to the Legg. They
wear them very wide, and commonly, they are made of green Cloath: a colour which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd
by the <hi>Turks;</hi> and this is indeed one of the chiefest differences of their Religion: upon
this accompt, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> having worn a green Cap, the <hi>Persians,</hi> the more to dishonour
that Colour, put their Feet into that which their great Prophet wore about his Head. Their
Shooes, which they call <hi>Kefs,</hi> are very picked at the toe, and very low quarter'd, so as that
they put them off and on, with as much ease as we do our Slippers. Which convenience they
the more stand in need of, in regard they put them off in the Antichamber, as well at their own
Houses, as when they visit their Friends, either upon business or otherwise. To this purpose,
I remember, that one day, going to the <hi>Chan's</hi> of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> about the time that he gives au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
for the Administration of Justice, we found, in the Antichamber, more shooes than
the richest Shooe-maker thereabouts had in his shop, and standing by them, one I may call the
<hi>Shooe-keeper,</hi> who with a forked stick gave those their shooes who went out.</p>
                  <p>The women wear much finer stuffs than the men do,<note place="margin">The Habit of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> and have not any thing to tye about the
waste: but their Drawers and Smocks are made after the same fashion as the Drawers and Shirts
of men. Their Stockings are ordinarily of red or green Velvet, and they have little or no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
about the Head, but suffer their Hair to hang down negligently, in several tresses, down
the back, and about the shoulders. All the Ornament they have about their Heads consists in
two or three rows of Pearls, which they do not wear about their Necks, as Women do else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
but about the Head, being set over the Fore-head, and falling down along the Cheeks
to be fasten'd under the Chin, so as that their Faces seem'd to be set in Pearls. Which may give
a little light to that expression in the <hi>Canticles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy Cheeks are comely with rows of Iewels.</hi>
Young maids sometimes wear Rings, with pretious Stones in them, in the right Nostril, as the
<hi>Tartarian</hi> Women do. They also wear of them on their Fingers, and about their Arms, and
they have bracelets of Silver-plates. But the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law allows not the men to wear
Gold Rings. Whence it came, that when our Ambassadors presented <hi>Saru Taggi,</hi> Chancellor
of <hi>Persia,</hi> with a very fair Diamond Ring, he had the stone taken off the Collet; and put into
Silver, and so presented it to the King. The Women do not uncover their faces as they go about
the City, but have over them a white Veil, which reaches down below their knees, which
they open a little to see their way. The <hi>Persians</hi> make an embleme of it, to signifie, that, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times, in a handsome Body, a wicked Soul may be log'd, and that, under a fair appearance
of good Life, a great number of enormous Vices may find shelter; as that Veil does often
times, under very rich Cloaths, hide a very Ugly Woman.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are very neat,<note place="margin">The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> are very neat.</note> as well in their Rooms and Furniture of them, as in their Habit,
wherein they would not have so much as a spot to be seen: insomuch that those who are of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to do it, change them as soon as they are ever so little stain'd, and others, who are not
much before hand with the World, have them wash'd once a week. VVhich is very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the humour of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> among whom a man seldome sees any Cloaths but what
are full of Nastiness, and shine with Grease. Nay it is certain, that the Stables and other such
Houses of the <hi>Persians,</hi> are kept much neater, than the Stoves and Lodging Chambers of the
<hi>Muscovites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are of a ready VVit and sound Judgement.<note place="margin">Iagenious.</note> They apply themselves to Studies,
and are very excellent in Poesy. Their Inventions are tich, and their Fancies subtil and strong.
They are so far from being any way Vain-glorious, that they slight no man, but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
they are complaisant, and of a Taking Conversation, very civil and obliging among
themselves, but especially to Strangers. The Submissions, wherewith they express themselves
in their Complements, exceed any thing they do in that kind in <hi>France.</hi> A <hi>Persian,</hi> to invite
his Friend to come into his House, and profer him his service, delivers himself in these terms:
<hi>Let me intreat you to make my House noble by your presence; I sacrifize my self to your Commands;
I lye prostrate at your Feet; to serve you, I wish the apple of my Eye might help to pave your
way,</hi> &amp;c. but for the most part, these are indeed but Complements. This puts me in mind of
a <hi>Persian,</hi> who coming to our Physician to acquaint him with a pain he had in his side, told
him, that if he could Cure him, he would give him his Head; whereupon it being represented
to him, that he should not be so much troubled at the want of Health, who was so prodigal
of his Life, he made answer, that he meant otherwise, but that it was their manner of speaking.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> have ever had the reputation of not being over-carefull to speak the truth;<note place="margin">Liars.</note> and
even to this day, those, who would speak it at all times, must pass, in their accompt, for
people a little troubled with simplicity. Whence it comes, that no man thinks himself injur'd,
when they say to him, <hi>Drugh Mikui,</hi> or, in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Language, <hi>Galan Diersen,</hi> that is,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47786:149"/>
thou hast told an untruth, and the word <hi>Galantsi,</hi> which signifies a Lyar, is accounted a drollish
expression, though <hi>Herodotus</hi> sayes it was a Vice the antient <hi>Persians</hi> hated most of any, and
that they made it their main business to bring up their young men, to Ride and Shoot well, and
to speak the Truth.</p>
                  <p>They are very faithfull in observing the particular friendships they contract together,<note place="margin">True in their friendships</note> and
they enter into Fraternities among themselves, which last as long as they live, nay they are so
exact in the improving of these, that they preferr them before all Obligations of either Blood
or Birth. In <hi>Germany,</hi> there is no reckoning paid, but those Drunken persons who clubb to it,
make some fraternity; yet is not the friendship contracted thereby, ever the greater, in regard
there cannot really be any between such as are incapable of it: but in <hi>Persia,</hi> it is far otherwise.
It is their custom to make every year a great Feast, whereat all the men between whom there is
any thing of Kinred, and some other friends, meet together, and if, at that assembly there be
any persons, who, out of a reciprocal and particular affection, are desirous to enter into a
more close and constant friendship, they address themselves to some one of the Company, whom
they take by the border of his Garment, and having told him that they make choice of him for
their <hi>Babba,</hi> Father or God-father, which the other cannot deny, they go all three together,
to their <hi>Calif,</hi> (there being no Family but hath its own) kiss his Hand, and crave his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
To receive which, they lye down upon their Bellies, first the God-father,
and afterwards the Brethren, at the <hi>Calif</hi>'s feet, who gives each of them three strokes with a
wand upon the Back, pronouncing at the first stroke, the word <hi>Alla,</hi> at the second, that of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> and at the third that of <hi>Haly.</hi> That done, they kiss the wand, and with this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
the Fraternity is establish'd. And this kind of alliance is so sacred, according to their
opinion of it, that they affirm, there is no other sin but may be pardoned; that Sacrilege and
Idolatry are not irremissible, and that a man may hope for pardon, if he hath drunk Wine, nay
in case he hath abus'd an <hi>Abdalla;</hi> but that the privileges of this kind of Fraternity cannot be
Violated, and the offence not be Punish'd. And if it happen that two of these Brethren fall
out, they are to be reconcil'd at the next assembly; which is done thus. He who hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
comes to his Door who did him the injury, bowing down his Head, and, with his Arms
carelessly hanging down, continues in that posture, till the other hath intreated him thrice to
come into his House, and thence they go together to the assembly, where the reconciliation is
perfected. The <hi>Persians</hi> are of a good nature, and very sensible of any kindness done them;
but where they hate, they are irreconcilable. They are Couragious, and good Soldiers, going
chearfully upon any design or engagement, though never so dangerous.</p>
                  <p>They are also modest, and very reserv'd; whence it comes, they never make water stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but squat down as Women do, and when they have done, wash themselves. It is upon
this accompt, that, at Weddings, and other great assemblies, they have in some by-places, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
earthen pots full of water. If they be near a Brook, or River, they will be sure to make
water in it, whence the <hi>Turks,</hi> by derision, call them <hi>Cher Scahei,</hi> that is, the King's or <hi>Aly</hi>'s

are more Luxurious than any other Nation in the World. For, not thinking it enough to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
several VVives, and besides, them, to have a great number of Concubines, they have a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
left for common VVhores. Accordingly, there is no City, <hi>Ardebil</hi> only excepted, where
there are not publick places appointed for that sport, under the protection of the Magistrate.
During our aboad at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> one of our Souldiers having had his pleasure of a VVoman, got
away without paying her. She made her complaints to the <hi>Chan,</hi> who sent to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
to entreat them to take same course that she might be satisfy'd, sending them word, that
it was but reasonable, that the <hi>Kahbe,</hi> who pay the King a great Tribute, should be also paid
the Salary due to them. VVe have given an accompt elsewhere, what use the <hi>Persians</hi> make of
them at their great Feasts; and this custom is so antient, that <hi>Herodotus</hi> speaks of it, when he
sayes, that the Ambassadors of the <hi>Persians</hi> told <hi>Amintas,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> that it was
their custom, when they entertain'd their Friends to give them also the Divertisement of VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

was Chancellor of <hi>Persia</hi> at the time of our Travels, was not punish'd for his <hi>Sodomy,</hi> but for
the Violence he had done in the Commission of it. The King himself was given to this Vice,
and so far from punishing it in another, that, as we were told, in the year 1634. <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi>
being at the siege of <hi>Eruan,</hi> one of the Colonels, who was got drunk at the King's quarters,
would, at his return to his own, in the heat of his VVine, having forc'd a young Lad that serv'd
him, and had often before refus'd to hearken to his lewd addresses. The Boy, to prevent the
violence, which he now saw was unavoidable, layes hold on the Ponyard, which his Master
wore at his Girdle, and therewith run him into the Heart. The next day, the King missing the
Colonel, ask'd what was become of him. Some body told him, he had been kill'd by one of
his Domesticks, and gave him an account how it had been done. The Boy was brought before
him, who very ingenuously confess'd what had pass'd between his Master and him, and avow'd,
that the horror he conceiv'd at that sin had made him take that resolution. The King was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd,
that he Commanded him to be cast to the Dogs, to be torn to pieces by them. The two
first that were brought would not meddle with him, but afterwards they got two <hi>English</hi>
Mastives, which upon the first setting on tore him to pieces.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law allows them to be Luxurious,<note place="margin">Polygamy allowed in <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </note> not only by permitting Polygamy, but
also those other carnal enjoyments, wherein the chiefest part of their Beatitude consists, even
that which the <hi>Mussulmans</hi> of that Religion expect after this Life; it being their perswasion,
that, in their celestial Paradise, they shall not only have the same lawfull Wives they had in
this World, but that they shall also have as many Concubines and Servants, as they please, and
enjoy all other Women, as often as they have a mind to it.</p>
                  <p>They use all imaginable inventions to stir themselves up to lust, and to this end have they, at
all meetings, whether at common Tipling Houses, or elsewhere, men and women Dancers, who
provoke them to brutality by their obscene postures. They use also the seed and leaves of Hemp,
to revive languishing Nature, though our Naturalists assign it a cold quality, which weakens
and corrupts Nature. I cannot imagine how this can add any fewel to their lustfull inclinations;
unless it be that the windy humour of it be also expulsive, or that in these hot Countries, it hath
other qualities, than it hath in <hi>Europe.</hi> To prepare this Drugg, they gather the leaves before
they come to Seed, dry them in the shade, beat them to powder, which they mix with Honey,
and make pills thereof, about the bigness of a Pidgeons Egg. They take two or three of them
at a time, to fortifie Nature. As to the Seed, they sry it, put a little Salt thereto, and eat it
by way of Desert. <hi>Imanculi,</hi> who was sent Ambassador from the King of <hi>Persia</hi> to the Duke of
<hi>Holstein,</hi> took of it at every meal, after he had married a young Woman at <hi>Astrachan,</hi> he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
being seventy years of age. Persons of good repute, in <hi>Persia,</hi> will not eat of it, for they
say, that he who makes use of this remedy commits a greater sin, than he that had ravish'd his
own Mother upon <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Sepulchre. They call those who use it, <hi>Bengi kidi bengi.</hi> But
when all is done, the <hi>Persians</hi> think they have sufficiently expiated the sin of Fornication, when,
immediately after they have had their pleasure of a Woman, they either bath themselves, or
wash their Bodies all over with cold water.</p>

to very little, unless it be in those Famalies where there are many Women, who inflame the
Bill very much. The Cotton-Cloath, which makes most of their Cloathing, is very cheap there.
Their Houses are but poorly furnish'd, and they think they have to spare, when the floor of their
Lodging Room is cover'd with Tapistry; and all the provision they make for the whole year,
is only Rice. Flesh is not dear, save only at those places, where the great number of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
makes all Provisions scarce, in regard they are for the most part brought out of remote
Provinces. The Garden supplies them with a Desert, and the next Brook serves them for a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
They are very neat about their Rooms, and they suffer not Dogs, which out of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respects, they hold to be unclean Creatures, or any other Animals to come into them.
And whereas they have this inconvenience at meals that they use no Trenchers, they use a sort
of Pots which they call <hi>Tustahn,</hi> about the bigness of our Chamber-pots, setting one of them
between every two Persons; and into these they spet, and cast the bones, and parings of Fruits.
We have said elsewhere, that they have their <hi>Tennrs,</hi> or Stoves to keep them warm, and to
spare Wood as much as may be, nay some makes a shift to roast and boyl their meat with
them.</p>
                  <p>In the Kitchin,<note place="margin">Their Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdstuff.</note> they have Kettles and Pots of Brass, or of Copper tinn'd over, which are
commonly fasten'd to the Hearth, as also earthen pots. In many Provinces they are pretty well
stor'd with VVood; but there are others, where they have only Loppings, and many times
they are forc'd to warm themselves with Cow or Camels-dung, dry'd in the Sun. Their Dishes
are of Copper, but so handsomely made, and so well tinn'd over, that Silver Plate cannot
look better. Some have Porcelane, and the Country people are glad of earthen ware. As to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47786:150"/>
their meat, they do not care for much, as being satisfy'd with very little. Which is contrary
to what <hi>Bizarrus</hi> relates of them, to wit, that Butchers meat is dear in <hi>Persia,</hi> by reason of
the Gluttony of the Inhabitants, which, as he affirms, is so great, that aged persons there make
four meals a day, and consequently, with much more reason, the younger sort of people.
Nor does this agree neither with the account the antients give of them, who generally affirm
that the <hi>Persians</hi> were very temperate, and contented themselves with little Meat, but they
lov'd Fruits. Accordingly, during the aboad we made in <hi>Persia,</hi> I observ'd that one of their
chiefest Vertues was Temperance, and that the <hi>Persians</hi> seldome eat Flesh above once a day, and
that if they make another meal besides, it consists, for the most part, of Butter, Cheese, and
Fruits, though I must confess there are some who make two set meals.</p>
                  <p>There is not any thing more ordinary in <hi>Persia</hi> than Rice soak'd in water.<note place="margin">Their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary food is Rice.</note> They call it <hi>Plau,</hi>
and eat of it at all their Meals, and serve it up in all their Dishes, especially under boild Mutton.
They some times put thereto a little of the juyce of Pomegranates or Cherries, and Saffron,
insomuch that commonly you have Rice of several Colours in the same Dish. They serve it up
also under Capons, and broild Fish. They also eat Sorrel, Spinage, and Cabbages, white and
green, but they do not much care for the red. They do not want small Birds, and they have all
sorts of Fowl in abundance, Turkeys only excepted, which are so scarce in this Country, that
a <hi>Georgian</hi> Merchant, having brought thither some of them from <hi>Venice,</hi> in the time of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi>
he sold them at a <hi>Tumain,</hi> that is, near five pound <hi>sterl.</hi> a piece. Parridges and Feasants
are common, and, at those places where they are to be had, they may be bought cheap enough.</p>
                  <p>Though Rice serves them instead of Bread,<note place="margin">Which servs them for Bread,</note> yet do they make some, of several sorts, of
Wheat also. The <hi>Komatsch</hi> are three fingers thick, and a foot and a half in length. The <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wasch</hi>
are round, and about the thickness of a man's finger. The <hi>Peasek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and they are bak'd in their Houses, over the <hi>Tenurs,</hi> on which they are set, and with the five
fingers of the hand, they make them as many Horns, whence they have their name. The <hi>Sengek</hi>
are made upon the pebbles, wherewith some of their Ovens are covered, so that this kind of
Bread or Cakes is uneven, and full of pits. The <hi>Iaucha</hi> is like Wafers, and as thinn as Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but in length and breadth they are half an Ell or better. The <hi>Persians</hi> use them instead of
Napkins, to wipe their fingers, wherewith they take up the Rice, and pull their Meat to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for you shall seldome see them use any Knives. When they have put the <hi>Iaucha's</hi> to this
use, they tear them into bits, put a little Rice or a Morsel of flesh into one of them, and so
swallow it down, or haply eat them without any thing with them. All their Spoons, even
the King's, are of Wood, made Oval-wise, at the end of a very small handle, but a foot and
a half in length.</p>

                     </note> especially that of the meanest sort of people, is water, into which

Sepulchre, and are to forbear it all their Lives after, out of a perswasion they are of,
that all their merits would be effac'd, by so enormous a sin. But such as are lovers of Wine,
and the common prostitutes, who have for the most part contracted a necessary habit of sinning,
Drink of it without any scruple, out of a presumption, that that sin will be pardoned them with
the rest, provided they do not make the Wine themselves. Whence it comes they make no great
entertainment, but they drink very freely of it. After meal, there is warm water brought in
for the washing of their hands.</p>

make pills of it of the bigness of a Pea, and take two or three of them at a time. Those who are
accustomed thereto will take about an Ounce at a time. There are some who take of it only once
in two or three daies, which makes them sleepy, and a little disturbs their brains, so as that
they are as if they were a little entred in Drink. There is abundance of it made in <hi>Persia,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and it is thus ordered. The Poppy being yet green, they cleave the Head of
it, out of which there comes a white Liquor, which being expos'd to the Air grows black, and
their Apothecaries and Druggists trade very much in it. All over the East they use this Drugg,
the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> as well as the <hi>Persians,</hi> insomuch, that <hi>Bellon</hi> saies, in his Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that if a <hi>Turk</hi> hath but a peny, he will spend a farthing of it in <hi>Opium;</hi> that he saw above
fifty Camels loaden with it, going from <hi>Natolia</hi> into <hi>Turquey, Persia,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> and that
a <hi>Ianizary,</hi> who had taken a whole Ounce of it one day, took the next day two, and was
never the worse for it, save that it wrought the same effect in him as Wine does in such as take
too much of it, and that he stagger'd a little. It hath also this quality common with Wine, that
it does infuse Courage into those who have not much; whence it comes, that the <hi>Turks</hi> take of
it before they go upon any design. The Women do not ordinarily take any; but those who are
not able to bear with their untoward and imperious Husbands, and preferr Death before the

Slavery they live in, do sometimes make use of <hi>Opium,</hi> whereof they take a good quantity,

full of it at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> being put up in Baggs, where it is reduc'd in a manner to powder, and is
at least as small as <hi>Sena.</hi> They highly esteem that which is brought them out of <hi>Europe,</hi> and call
it <hi>Inglis Tambaku,</hi> because the <hi>English</hi> are they who bring most of it thither. They are so great
lovers of it, that, when I gave a piece thereof to a Master, who taught me the <hi>Arabian</hi> Language
at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> he took it for an extraordinary kindness. To take it with any delight, they
make use of a Glass Flaggon, an Earthen Pitcher, a <hi>Cocos,</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Nut-shell, or a <hi>Kaback,</hi>
which is the rind of a certain sort of Citralls, or Cucumbers, which they fill half full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or little more, and sometimes put a little perfum'd Waters into it. Into this water they
put a little hollow Reed, having at the end of it a Bole wherein they put the Tobacco with a
little Coal, and with another Pipe, about an Ell long, which they have in their Mouths, they
draw, through the water, the smoke of the Tobacco, which leaving in the water all its soot
and blackness, is incomparably more pleasant this way, than as we take it. Those who have
not all these conveniences are glad to take it our way; but their Pipes, which have Boles or
Heads of Earth or Stone, are of Wood, and much longer than ours.</p>
                  <p>They Drink,<note place="margin">Cahwa, <hi>or</hi> Coffee.</note> with their Tobacco, a certain black water, which they call <hi>Cahwa,</hi> made of
a Fruit brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and which is in colour like ordinary Wheat, and in tast like
<hi>Turkish</hi> Wheat, and is of the bigness of a little Bean. They fry, or rather burn it in an Iron
pan without any Liquor, beat it to powder, and boyling it with fair water, they make this
Drink thereof, which hath as it were the tast of a burnt Crust, and is not pleasant to the Palate.
It hath a Cooling quality, and the <hi>Persians</hi> think it allays the Natural heat. Whence it comes,
that they often drink of it, inasmuch as they would avoid the charge of having many Children,
nay they are so far from dissembling the fear they have thereof, that some of them have come to
our Physician for remedies of that kind. But he being a merry dispos'd Person, made answer,
that he would rather help them to get Children, than give them ought to prevent the getting
of them. I say the <hi>Persians</hi> are perswaded this water is able absolutely to smother all Natural
heat, and to take away the power of engendring; and to this purpose they tell a story of one
of their Kings, named <hi>Sulthan Mahomet Caswin,</hi> who Reign'd in <hi>Persia</hi> before <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s
time, that he was so accustom'd to the Drinking of <hi>Cahwa,</hi> that he had an inconceivable aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for Women; and that the Queen standing one day at her Chamber Window, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
they had got down a Horse upon the ground, in order to the Gelding of him, ask'd some
that stood by, why they treated so handsome a Creature in that manner; whereupon answer
being made her, that he was too Fiery and Metalsome, and that the business of those that were
about him, was, with the taking away of the excess of Metal, which Stone-Horses are guilty
of, to deprive him of all generative Vertue; the Queen reply'd, that that trouble might have
been spar'd, since the <hi>Cahwa</hi> would have wrought the same effect; and that if they would
keep the Stone-Horse with that Drink, he would, in a short time, be as cold as the King her
Husband.</p>
                  <p>They affirm further, that the Son of that King, whom they also, after his Father, call
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> being come to the Crown, Commanded that great Poet, <hi>Hakim Fardausi,</hi> to give
him a piece of his Writing, and promis'd by way of reward to give him a Ducat for every
Verse. The Poet in a short time made sixty thousand, which are at this day accounted the best
that ever were made in <hi>Persia;</hi> but the King who expected not he should have made such haste,
sent him to those who had the over-sight of his Revenue, who judging this to be too great a
summ for a Poet, told him he must content himself with a less recompence. Accordingly they
brought it so low, that <hi>Fardausi</hi> made other Verses, wherein he reproach'd the King with his
avarice, and told him, the present he had made him, might be rather though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Porter than a Prince. Whereto he added, that Shooe-makers and Bakers were wont to do so,
and that he could not be perswaded that the King was of Royal Extraction, but must rather be
descended from some Shooe-maker or Baker.</p>
                  <p>The King was so nettled at these reproaches, that he made his Complaints thereof to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who presently imagining, that the Poet had made some Discoveries of her, ingenuously
acknowledg'd to her Son, that the King, her Husband, being become impotent through his
excessive Drinking of <hi>Cahwa,</hi> she fancied a Baker belonging to the Court, and that this Baker
was his Father; That she chose rather to take that course, than leave the Kingdom destitute of
Heirs; That he was now to consider, that had it not been for that Baker, he had not been at
all, and that he would do well to recompence the Poet, so as that the business might take no
further wind, lest the people should deprive him of a Crown which belong'd not to him. The
Son made his advantage of the advice and remonstrances of his Mother, and ordered the Poet
should have what he had promised him.</p>

penetrate them, they may hold them in their hands, even though the water were boyling. The
<hi>Persians, Indians, Chineses</hi> and <hi>Iaponneses</hi> assign thereto such extraordinary qualities, that,
imagining it alone able to keep a man in constant health, they are sure to treat such as come to
visit them, with this Drink, at all hours. The quality it is, by experience, found to have, is,
that it is astringent, and that it consumes superfluous Humours, which incommodate the Brain,
and provoke Drowsiness. They who have Written of the affairs of the <hi>Indies,</hi> as <hi>Maffeus,
Linschooten, Trigault,</hi> and others, tell Miracles of it: but this herb is now so well known in
most parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> where many persons of quality use it with good success, that it must needs
be known, what are both its good and bad qualities: which Dr. <hi>Tulp,</hi> a Physician of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
hath very strictly examined, in the last Chapter of the fourth Book, of his <hi>Medicinal Observations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> live either on the Fruits which their Gardens bring forth, or by the advantage
they make by Tilling the ground. Some live by Traffick, others by their Trades; some to the
Warrs, and there are those who get their livelyhood by Writing. For since Printing is not yet
used amongst them, and that they stand in need of many Copies of their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> they have
them done by a sort of people, who do not only get a livelyhood thereby, but grow very rich,
inasmuch as a Copy of it well written: will yield eighteen or twenty Crowns. Whence it
comes, that there is no man that hath Children, but he teaches them to write, and yet there are
an infinite number of men in <hi>Persia</hi> who live only by writing.</p>
                  <p>It is a pleasant sight, as a man passes over the <hi>Maidan,</hi> or through the <hi>Basar,</hi> to see the
Tradesmen of all Professions in their Shops, where they sell what they had made at their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
for it is very seldome seen, that a Tradesman works in his Shop, which for the most part
is at some distance from the place where he lives, and confin'd to certain parts of the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
where every Trade hath its distinct quarter, only for the selling of Commodities. The
most common Professions are Weavers, Dyers, and Painters, who paint Flowers upon the
Stuffs of Silk and Cotton, and sometimes even upon <hi>Brocadoe.</hi> The ordinary length of their
pieces of stuffs is not above five or six Ells, it being as much as needs for a Garment according to
their fashion. The fairest Stuffs, as well for Painting, as Workmanship, are made at <hi>Iescht</hi>
and <hi>Kaschan,</hi> where they represent upon Silk and Cotton, the figures of Persons, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

                     </note> and the Characters of their Language, so exactly done, that no Painter can do
things with such Life and Art. Using only what they spend themselves in Cloaths, they Trade
with the rest into other parts, with great profit, as they do also with unwrought Cotton and raw
Silk, whereof there are great quantities brought into <hi>Europe,</hi> through the <hi>Indies.</hi> As for the
Silk, it is worth in <hi>Persia</hi> not above 2s. 6d. or 2s. 8d. the pound. Their o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Persia</hi> yields year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 20000. Balls of Silk.</note> It is conceived that <hi>Persia</hi> produces every year, one with another,
ten thousand <hi>Somms,</hi> or twenty thousand Balls of Silk, every Ball weighing two hundred and
sixteen pounds. The Province of <hi>Kilan</hi> it self, in good years, yields eight thousand Balls;
<hi>Schiruan,</hi> three thousand; <hi>Chorasan,</hi> as many; <hi>Mesanderan,</hi> two thousand; <hi>Karabath,</hi> two
thousand. In which accompt we do not comprehend what <hi>Georgia,</hi> which is richer in Silk than
any other Province, produces within it self. They say, that all <hi>Persia</hi> does not spend above a
thousand Balls of Silk, and that the rest is sold into <hi>Turkie,</hi> the <hi>Indies, Italy,</hi> and to the <hi>English</hi>
and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who Trade at <hi>Ormus,</hi> and who bring thither Tinn, Copper, <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>

are not good at the ordering of VVoollen stuffs, do so highly esteem, that ordinary Cloath is
sold there at 20. or 24. Crowns the yard.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants, who are <hi>Christians,</hi> are the richest of any, by reason of the
pains they take in making Voyages themselves, which is more than the other <hi>Persians</hi> do;
though both have an absolute freedome to Traffick where they please themselves, as Foreiners
have the liberty to come into <hi>Persia,</hi> and put off their Commodities there, paying custom; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47786:152"/>
without the <hi>Czaar</hi>'s express permission. There is also this particular advantage in <hi>Persia,</hi> as
well as <hi>Turkey,</hi> that the VVars do not obstruct their Commerce, the <hi>Caravans</hi> and other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
having the same freedome to go to and fro,<note place="margin">Trading not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by the Wars.</note> in the time of war, as they have in Peace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as both those Princes are equally concern'd to improve the advantages they make thereby.
The commerce of the <hi>Persians</hi> would be incomparably greater than it is, if they could make
their benefit of that which the Sea affords them, and if Navigation were as well setled there, as
it is in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Wars, which the King of <hi>Persia</hi> is oblig'd to carry on sometimes against the <hi>Turks,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
against the <hi>Mogul</hi> and the <hi>Vsbeques Tartars,</hi> make him stand in need of a great number of
Souldiers. Those who are entertain'd into his Service have a setled pay at all times, as we shall
have occasion to speak more fully to anon.</p>
                  <p>Having spoken of the Shops, the Cellars and the Kitchins of the <hi>Persians,</hi> I must not forget
their Chambers, and what belongs to them; nor yet their Marriages A <hi>Persian,</hi> who thinks
himself able to maintain several Wives, will seldome be content with one. Polygamy is an old
evil, deeply rooted in them. <hi>Strabo</hi> is of opinion, that they took several Wives, because
they would have many Children, and to get the reward which their Kings gave those who had
many Males. They are still willing enough to take the Wives, but not upon the same Motives,
since they use all the means they can to hinder their getting of Children. What they do now is
purely upon the accompt of pleasure, that their enjoyments may be heightned by the variety.
To this purpose, they have a Proverb, which says, that, to have a perpetual Spring, a man
must often change Wives, and use them as Almanacks, which serve but for a year. The <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi>
permits the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> to marry as many Wives as they are able to maintain. Whence
it comes that rich Merchants, who are oblig'd to Travel up and down the Country, marry
Wives, and keep Houses in several places, that where ever they come they may be at home.
Yet do I not advise any man to believe those, who say, there is Law in <hi>Media,</hi> whereby
men are enjoyn'd to Marry at least seven VVives; nor yet what <hi>Niger</hi> says in his Geography,
that the Children kill their Father and Mother, when they are come to seventy years of age.
These are idle stories, which have no ground in the antient History, and whereto we found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
consonant in our time.</p>
                  <p>It is not our design to dilate much upon the inconveniences of Polygamy; but certain it is,
that,<note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy.</hi>
                     </note> in <hi>Persia,</hi> there is but little friendship among the VVomen. Some love there may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, but it is no doubt of that kind which comes near brutality. It is impossible also
that a Family, where there are so many women, can be free from jealousie, which is inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
among those, who would all be lov'd, and absolutely depend on him, who should, but
cannot, love them all equally. The <hi>Persians</hi> themselves, to express the inconveniences of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy,
say in their Proverbs, that, as two Asses are more troublesome to be driven, than a
whole <hi>Caravan;</hi> so a Judge finds not so much difficulty in deciding the differences of a Province,
as a man distracted by two VVomen, who cannot live together without some jarring. VVe
were told several examples of the great mischiefs happening in Families through Polygamy, and
and among the rest one, concerning <hi>Silfaher, Chan</hi> of <hi>Scamachie.</hi> He was a Person of very
great Authority in the Country, and well look'd upon at the Court, where he had Married the
Sister of <hi>Schach-Chodabende,</hi> who was Father to <hi>Schach-Abas.</hi> This VVoman conceiving a
jealousie at the affection her Husband express'd towards another young Lady whom he had
Married, and imagining her quality would take away all Comparison between her and her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
was so highly incens'd against him, that she resolv'd to be reveng'd; and to that purpose
writ to the King her Nephew, to bid him beware of her Husband, as having some design up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Person. <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> who took the least suspicions for certain proofs, immediately
Commanded <hi>Kartschichai-Chan, Chan</hi> of <hi>Mesched,</hi> who was then about him at <hi>Ardebil,</hi> to
go and bring him <hi>Silfahar</hi>'s Head. <hi>Kartschichai</hi> being come to the foot of the Mountain of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi>
in the Province of <hi>Schiruan,</hi> sent one to <hi>Silfahar,</hi> to desire him to come to him. <hi>Silfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har,</hi>
not fearing any mischief from the other, who was his intimate Friend, departed upon the
first summons, and coming late at Night to the place appointed him by the other, he set up his
Tent near that of <hi>Kartschichai.</hi> The next day <hi>Kartschicai</hi> getting up betimes in the Morning,
went to <hi>Silfahar,</hi> who was in Bed, and having awak'd and kindly saluted him, he desir'd him
to rise and take a VValk with him, for he had some affairs of great consequence to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to him. But while <hi>Silfahar</hi> was putting on his Cloaths, <hi>Kartschichai,</hi> perceiving his soul
was in a quiet posture, in regard he was going to his Prayers, made a sign to his Servants,
who knew what they had to do, to dispatch him, and having caus'd his Head to be cut off, he
brought it to Court.</p>
                  <p>It happened also, not long before our Travels into <hi>Persia,</hi> that one who kept a Tipling-house
at <hi>Ardebil,</hi> whose name was <hi>Schiritzi Aly,</hi> being Drinking very late with one of his Friends,
upon that Bridge of the City. which is called <hi>Heider Aly,</hi> saw coming towards him a loaden
Mule, which seem'd to look after a Master, while the true owner, who was a Merchant, was
gone to ease himself on the River side. <hi>Schiritzi</hi> had the good nature and charity to drive the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47786:152"/>
Mule to his own House, to unload it, and to turn him out again to look for his Mastet, who
coming immediarely into the City, met with his Mule in the streets, but discharg'd of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
He went and made his complaints to the Governour, who bid him name the person that
had robb'd him, and he would do him Justice. But the Merchant, not satisfy'd with this answer,
made his Case known to the King, who presently recommended him to <hi>Aliculi-Chan,</hi> with
express order to see the Merchants loss made good to him, to the full value he should set upon
his Commodities, inasmuch as the <hi>Chan</hi> had not been careful to secure the High-way, and
neglected to make an exact enquiry after the Thief; which order the <hi>Chan</hi> was forc'd to obey.
<hi>Schiritzi,</hi> on the other side, finding his Fortune much better'd by this unexpected Wind-fall,
and not thinking one Wife enough, Marries a second, which he took up out of the Brothel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
but had no Children by her, By the former, he had a Son, who, one day coming from
School, and finding in the Chamber a Melon, whereof some part had been cut, presum'd to
take a piece of it, and by that means gave the young VVoman occasion to strike him. The
Child's Mother came into the Room, and reveng'd him, not only by fighting with her Rival,
but also by the complaints she made thereof to her Husband, representing to him the insolence
of that young VVoman, with so much bitterness, that being no longer able to endure her Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
he gave her a good Cudgelling. The VVoman exasperated at that, went to the <hi>Chan,</hi>
and acquainted him with the Adventure of the Mule. The <hi>Chan</hi> immediately sent for the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verner,
and having found him guilty of the Fact, order'd him to be hang'd. And whereas the
two Women had discover'd the Robbery, out of pure animosity and private resentments, rather
than out of any affection they had for the Governour, or regard of publick Justice, he caus'd them
to be publickly ravish'd, and banish'd them out of the City. The Taverners Son was sold,
and all his Fathers Estate confiscated to the use of the Governour, who lost nothing by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are not so scrupulous in their Contracts of Marriage, but that many times it
happens a Man Marries his Brother's VViddow;<note place="margin">Incest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated.</note> yet could I not learn, that Incests were so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
there as some Authors would have it believ'd, nor that the Son meddles with his Mother,
or the Brother with his Sister. Nay it cannot be found, that, before the Reign of
<hi>Cambyses,</hi> who fell in love with his own Sister, there was any talk of these incests
in <hi>Persia,</hi> no more than there was in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> before <hi>Ptolomey</hi>'s time. There Marriages are
celebrated as followeth.</p>
                  <p>When a young Man hath a mind to Marry,<note place="margin">Their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Marriage,</note> and hath heard of some person he can fancy, he
employs others to make enquiry into the qualities and disposition of the young Maid, inasmuch
as neither he nor any of his Relations are permitted to see her, and if upon the account he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
of her by them, he finds his affections inclin'd to her, he makes a demand of her by two of
his Friends, who had been his God-fathers at his Circumcision, or, for want of those, by two
others of his Kinred. This first Embassy ordinarily finds no very kind reception, lest they
should imagine the Father to be over-forward to be rid of his Daughter. But if on the other
side, the young mans Friends find that his addresses are not taken amiss, they continue them,
and proceed to Articles, and agree upon the Dower, which, in these Countries, the Friends
of the Bridegroom, and not those of the Bride are to give. The Dower is to be either in Money,
which the young man sends to his Mistriss, some few dayes before the Marriage, as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to the Father and Mother for their Care in the Education of their Daughter; or he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
her by the contract of Marriage, a certain sum of Money, or such a quantity of Silk, or
Stuffs, to be paid in Case of Divorce. These contracts are pass'd in the presence of the <hi>Kasi,</hi> or
the <hi>Molla</hi> who signs them. That done, they name on both sides certain persons to be as it
were Agents, who in the name of the betroathed parties, go to the <hi>Kasi,</hi> or Ecclesiastical
Judge, if it be in the City, or, if in a Village, to the <hi>Molla,</hi> who is empower'd by the <hi>Kasi</hi> to
that purpose, and who, being satisfy'd that all is done with the consents of the Kinred on both
sides, as also of the parties contracted, Marries them by the said Agents, in the name of <hi>God,</hi>
of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and of <hi>Aly,</hi> delivering them a Certificate of the Marriage. This Ceremony is
for the most part, performed in private, the <hi>Kasi</hi> or <hi>Molla</hi> taking along with him the two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
into a private room, or haply into the fields, to some place where no people come, out of
a fear that some trick might be put upon the new Married couple, or some Witch-craft used up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Bridegroom. Whence it comes, that, when the Marriage is celebated in publick, before
the <hi>Kasi,</hi> as it often happens, (the <hi>Persians</hi> it seems, having the superstition to do actions of
this consequence according to their Observance of certain Constellations, which they think for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
or unfortunate to them) that the Judge may not be frustrated in the execution of his
Duty, they oblige all that are present, to stretch out their hands, that they may not be able to
do any thing of Witchcraft under their Garments. The <hi>Persian,</hi> whom we brought along with
us to <hi>Holstein,</hi> told us, that when he was Married, one of his Wife's Kinred cut a little piece of
blew Galoom-lace off his Garment, wherewith he made his enchantments, which made him
impotent for above two years and a half, till such time as having heard of a Sorcerer that liv'd
at <hi>Serab,</hi> who had the secret to dissolve those Charms, he went to him about it. This pretended
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47786:153"/>
Sorcerer, or Magician, who was lame in both hands and feet, seeing him coming towards him,
told him he knew what was the occasion of his discontent, and that he should be eas'd of it, as
soon as he had taken a Nail out of a hole of a certain Wall, which he told him of, which when
he had done, he could perform the duty of a Married man as well as any other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strabo</hi> affirms, that, heretofore, the <hi>Persians</hi> observed the Vernal Equinox as the fittest time
for their Marriages; but now they are absolutely indifferent as to the Season, and a man may
be Married on any day, save only in the Moneth of <hi>Ramesan,</hi> which is their Lent, and during
the ten dayes of the <hi>Aschur,</hi> when the Ceremonies performed in remembrance of the interment
of <hi>Hossein</hi> employ their Devotions; inasmuch as during that time, they allow not of any Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
at all.</p>
                  <p>The Wedding day being appointed, the young man sends, the day before, to his intended
Wife, Pendants, Bracelets and other Ornaments, suitably to their qualities, as also some
Dishes of Meat, to entertain the Relations and Friends, who are to bring the young Woman to
him: but neither of them both are present at the Dinner. In the Evening, towards Night, the
Bride is conducted, on Horse-back, or upon a Mule or Camel, cover'd with a Veil of Crimson
Taffata, which falls down below her Knees, accompany'd by her Kinred, and Musick, to the
Bridegroom's house. As soon as they are come to the House, they carry the Bride with her
Maids into one Chamber, and the Bridegroom with his Friends into another, and Supper is
brought up. Which ended, she is led to the Chamber where she is to lye, where the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
comes to her, and then is it that he hath the first sight of her. The Bridegroom, who
find his Bride broken up to his hands, may lawfully cut off her Nose and Ears, and turn her
away; but Persons of quality, for the most part, think it affront enough to the Bride who is
no Maid, to send her and her friends immediately packing away. But if he really finds her a
Maid, he sends the tokens of it, by an antient Woman, to her Friends, and then they continue
their entertainments for three dayes together. After the first engagement, the Bridegroom gets
up from his Wife, and goes to his Friends, among whom he spends some hours in Merriment.
Persons of any Learning who come to these Entertainments, instead of Drinking, divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their Books, which, to that end, they bring along with them, and spend the time in
discourses of Morality, or speculative Philosophy, which they do also at those other assemblies
which they many times appoint for that purpose. Their Poets are never wanting at these Feasts,
and contribute very much to the Divertisements thereof, especially the next day after the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and the day after. Among other things, there is brought in, a great wooden Dish full of
Fruit, in the midst whereof there is a Tree, having on every branch Fruit and dri'd Conserves,
and if any one of the Company can take ought thence, so as that the Bridegroom perceives him
not, his slight is recompens'd with a Present, which the Bridegroom is oblig'd to make him:
but if he be surpriz'd therein, he must make good what he should have taken, a hundred fold;
They have also this custom, that if any one of the Company is not there the next day precisely
at the hour appointed for Dinner, he is laid upon a Ladder set against the Wall, with his Head
downwards, and Whipp'd on the soles of his Feet with a Handkercher roll'd about, till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems
himself.</p>
                  <p>They have also Dancing; but the Men Dance by themselves, in one room, and the
VVomen by themselves in another room, into which the Musick comes not, but stand at the
Door.</p>
                  <p>The next day after the Wedding, the Bridegroom washes himself, in the Winter time, in
Baths, which are very ordinary in those parts, and in the Summer, in the River, or next Brook;
but the Bride baths her self in the House. In the Evening they set before every one of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
invited, upon a Handkercher of Flower'd Cotton-Cloath, two spoonfulls of <hi>Chinne,</hi> which
is the Drugg, wherewith they Colour their Nails and Hands. That done, the Guests make
their Presents. If they have taken a little more Wine than they can well bear, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
they take up their Lodging at the House where they Supp'd; in regard the Watch which
is kept very strictly there in the Night, suffer not any to go in the Streets without a Lantern.
Those who find themselves well enough to go, give the Guard somewhat to Drink, and are
brought home to their Houses.</p>
                  <p>I shall here take occasion to say something of the excellent order observ'd in all Cities of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Watch in the Night.</note>
for the Guard. At <hi>Ardebil</hi> there are forty men, who incessantly walk about the Streets,
to prevent Mischiefs and Robberies, with such Vigilance and Exactness, that they are oblig'd
to Indemnify those that are Robb'd. Whence it came, that, at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> we came many times
after Midnight, from the Monastery of the <hi>Augustines,</hi> which was above half a League from
our quarters, yet never met with any mischief by the way: nay if at any time, as it might well
happen in that great City, we chanc'd to lose our way, the Guard would bring us with Torches
home to our very Doors. It is reported of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> that, desirous, one day, to make
tryal of the Vigilance of those people, suffer'd himself to be surpriz'd by them, and had been
carried to Prison, had he not been known by one of the Company, who discovering him to the
rest, they all cast themselves at his Feet, to beg his pardon. But he express'd himself well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47786:153"/>
with their care, and told them they had done but their duty; that he was King in the
day time, but that the keeping of the Publick peace in the night depended on them.</p>
                  <p>If it happen, that, after the Marriage, the Bride be oblig'd to live at her Husband's Father's
House, it is not lawfull for her to appear before him with her Face uncover'd, much more to
speak to him, till such time as the Father-in-Law hath hir'd her to do it, and given her a new
Garment, or a piece of Stuff to make one, to oblige her thereto. But after all this, she must
not uncover her Face in his presence, nor yet her Mouth when she eats: for she hath a piece of
Cloath, which they call <hi>Iaschmahn,</hi> ty'd to her ears, so as that it hangs over her Mouth, to
hinder her from being seen eating.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> keep their VVives more in restraint than the <hi>Italians</hi> do, and suffer them not
to go to Church, or to any great Feast, unless their Husbands go along with them. If a VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
permit her Face to be seen, all the Apologies she can make for her self shall not clear her
from the suspicion conceiv'd of her Dishonesty, even though she granted that favour to one of
her Husband's nearest Relations. This reserv'dness they also observe in their Hoases, where
they are kept up as close Prisoners. VVhen any business obliges them to go abroad, it it be a
foot, they cover themselves with a white Veil, like a VVinding-sheet, which reaches down to
half the Legg, and if it be on Horse-back, they are dispos'd into a kind of Chests, or at least
muffle up their Faces, so as that it is impossible to see them.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremonies we mention'd before are only for ordinary Marriages;<note place="margin">Marriage for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time.</note> but besides these,
there are two other kinds of Matrimony among the <hi>Persians,</hi> which are celebrated quite after
another manner. For those who are oblig'd to sojourn at other places besides those where their
ordinary Habitations are, yet are unwilling to take up their quarters in publick places, take
Wives for a certain time, allowing them a certain Salary, either for a Moneth, or such term

of Generation, and say, the Mother does only foment and feed the Child when it is once
conceiv'd; and upon the same accompt it is, that they affirm, that the Trees which bare fruit
are the Males, and that those which do not are the Females.</p>

Kinred and Nighbours run to the Schools, and make a present to the <hi>Molla,</hi> to oblige him to
give his Scholars leave to play, or at least to pardon some one of them that hath deserv'd to be
severely punish'd; imagining that by the liberty they procure for those Scholars, the Woman
in Labour is eas'd, and will be the sooner deliver'd of her burthen. It is also out of the same
perswasion, that, in such Emergencies, they let go their Birds, and many times purposely buy
some, that they may give them their liberty upon such an occasion. They do the like for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the agony of Death, who seem unwilling to dye. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> let go Birds when
they go to <hi>Confession;</hi> believing, that as they permit the Birds to fly away, so will God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
their sins far from them.</p>
                  <p>The men take an absolute liberty to see the Women when they please,<note place="margin">They are jealous.</note> but they allow not
their Wives the freedom of seeing so much as one man, so far are they from permitting them to
see any in private, so excessive is their jealousie. The offences Women commit contrary to their
faith plighted to their Husbands are unpardonable, nor indeed can they be guilty of any which
they will punish with greater severity, nay indeed cruelty. We were told an example of it,
that had happened in the Province of <hi>Lenkeran,</hi> in the time of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> who coming to
understand, that one of his Menial servants, who was called <hi>Iacupzanbeg, Kurtzi Tirkenan,</hi>
that is to say, he whose Office it was to carry the King's Bows and Arrows, had somewhat a
light Wife, sent him notice of it, with this message, that if he expected to continue at Court,
and to keep in his employment, it was expected he should cleanse his House. This message, and
the affliction he conceiv'd at the baseness of his Wife, and his reflection that it was known all
about the Court,<note place="margin">Adultery cruelly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> as also that of the hazard he was in to lose his place, put him into such a fury,
that, going immediately to his House, he cut in pieces, not only his Wife, but also her two
Sons, four Daughters, and five Chamber-maids, and so cleans'd his House by the blood of
twelve persons, most of them innocent, that he might not be turn'd out of his employment.
The Law of the Country allows them to kill the Adulterer with the Woman, if they be taken
in the fact. These accidents are not very extraordinary among them, and the Judge recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with a new Garment the person who does an Execution of this Nature: which I conceive is
instead of the Salary which he is oblig'd to pay the common Executioner.</p>

                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:47786:154"/>
Divorce is lawfull among them, and the dissolution of the Marriage is made before the Judge,
upon hearing of what both parties have to allege for themselves: for it is Lawful, not only for
the Men,<note place="margin">Divorce lawful.</note> but also for the Women to give Bills of Divorce, shewing good causes, not only for
Adultery, but also in several other Cases. Impotence, or Frigidity, rather declares the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
null, than dissolves it; and Adultery is punish'd among them, as we mentioned before. We
were told a story of a VVoman, who, desirous to part from her Husband, charg'd him with
impotence. The Husband desir'd the Judge to command the Woman to scratch his Back;
whereto she reply'd, <hi>I have scratch'd thee so often, that I am weary of it, and thou wouldst never
scratch me where it most itch'd.</hi> Another complain'd of her Husband, that he would have done
his work in the wrong place, whereupon the Judge ordered her to be separated from him, and
the Husband to be Gelt. They Marry again after Divorce, as well Men as VVomen, with
this difference nevertheless, that the VVomen are oblig'd to continue in VViddow-hood three
moneths and ten days, not only that it may be known, whether they are with Child, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that they may have time to work their accommodation with their Husbands, if they have
any such desire. The <hi>Turks</hi> following the Doctrine of <hi>Hanife,</hi> have, in this particular, a very
brutish custom, in regard that, in <hi>Turquey,</hi> there may be a reconciliation made after the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
but when a man hath put away his VVife three several times, or, at her puting away,
says only the word <hi>Vtzkatala,</hi> that is to say, I renounce thee thrice, he cannot take her again,
unless he permit the <hi>Molla</hi> to name some person, who is to lye with her before hand in her
Husbands presence, so as that he may be assur'd he hath done his work with her. I should not
set down a thing so extravagant, had I not inform'd my self of the truth thereof from Persons
of quality, either <hi>Turks</hi> born, or such as have liv'd several years at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who have
all assur'd me, that, of sixty two Sects, whereof the <hi>Turkish</hi> Religion consists, many have
this Custom, nay what is more, that they give Money to those who do them that good office.
There are some indeed who think it sufficient to put a-Bed with their VVives a young Lad, that
is not able to perform the work of Matrimony, which they do only for form sake, thereby to
reconfirm the Marriage.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose,<note place="margin">A pleasant story.</note> there is a Story, that during the time there was no other Religion allow'd
in <hi>Sulthania,</hi> but the <hi>Turkish,</hi> though there was a great number of persons who profess'd the
<hi>Persian</hi> Religion; the <hi>Sulthan,</hi> being one day incens'd against his Wife, said to her the word
<hi>Vtzkatala,</hi> so that being oblig'd by the Law to give her a Bill of Divorce, he immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of it, and not willing that another should make use of her, in order to his having of her
again, he ask'd his Ecclesiasticks whether there were not any <hi>Iman,</hi> who could dispence with
the severity of that Law. Whereto the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and the other <hi>Turkish</hi> Priests having return'd
their answer, that that Law was indispensable, he would needs hear what a certain <hi>Molla,</hi> named
<hi>Hassan Raschi</hi> could say in the business. This man was a <hi>Persian</hi> Born, and had the reputation
of a Jeaster, and one that made sport with things most serious, insomuch that there had been
no great notice taken of his affirming, that he knew an <hi>Iman,</hi> who would certainly dispense
with the <hi>Sulthan,</hi> had it not been for the passionate desire this latter had to take his Wife again,
wherein he was so earnest, that he hearkned to any advice was given him to that purpose. <hi>Hassan</hi>
came to see him; but instead of leaving his shooes behind him in the Antichamber, according to
the custom of the <hi>Persians,</hi> he brought them in under his arm. The <hi>Sulthan</hi> perceiving him
coming in that posture, ask'd him the reason of it, and whether he were afraid his shoos might
be stollen. <hi>Hassan</hi> made answer, that he was not afraid of any such thing, but only that he was
unwilling any other should put on his shoos, expressing thereby, that the <hi>Sulthan</hi> should not
permit another to lye with his Wife. Whereto he added, that in the time of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> some
body had done the <hi>Hanife</hi> the afront to take away his shoos. The <hi>Turkish</hi> Priests, who were
present at this discourse, laugh'd at him, and said, that if he had no better reasons to allege, to
satisfie the <hi>Sulthan,</hi> that he might take his Wife again, he might go his wayes, in as much as
<hi>Hanife</hi> had not liv'd in the time of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but long after. <hi>Hassan Kaschi,</hi> making his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of this answer, reply'd; If it be so, said he, that <hi>Hanife</hi> liv'd not in the time of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>
nor you neither, and that in the whole <hi>Alcoran</hi> there is not a word to be found of this
infamous Law, how can you tell whether <hi>Mahomet</hi> had any such intention? And how can
you impose this burthen upon the people? He thereupon cited the exposition of <hi>Saduk, Hanife</hi>'s
Master, upon the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and made it appear, that a Husband hath the power, not only
to give his Wife ill words, and to threaten her, but also to beat her, yet it shall not be in her
power to forsake him, for his so doing. This reason, which suited with the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s design,
pleas'd him so well, that he not only took his Wife again, but he also profess'd the <hi>Persian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and either put to Death or Banish'd all the <hi>Turkish</hi> Priests.</p>
                  <p>They relate another pleasant Story to the same purpose;<note place="margin">Another story.</note> to wit, that <hi>Solyman,</hi> Emperour
of the <hi>Turks,</hi> being one day angry with his Wife, did, in the heat of his passion, pronounce
the <hi>Vizala</hi> against her. He soon repented him of it, in regard his Wife, being one of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somest
Women in the VVorld, it went to his very soul to part with her; and it being not in
his power to take her again, till such time as she had pass'd through another man's hands, he
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47786:154"/>
bethought him, the only way were to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er Bedded by a <hi>Dervis,</hi> of the Sect of those, whom
they call <hi>Dervis Rastkeli,</hi> who were in so great repute for their sanctity and austerity of Life, that
he had not the least fear he wouldmedd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e with her. It is to be observ'd by the way, that he, who
thus lies with the VVife, is before solemnly Married to her, and when he hath done his work,
is Divorc'd from her, otherwise it were adultery. <hi>Soliman</hi> then, having concluded the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
between his VVife and the <hi>Dervis,</hi> ordered them to go to Bed together: but they gave one
the other such mutual satisfaction, and ere they came out of the Bed, were so well agreed, that
the next day, they declar'd, that they had an affection one for the other, and that they would
not be separated; so that, it being not in the power of the Law to force them to a Divorce,
<hi>Solyman</hi> was forc'd to let him enjoy his VVife, who went along with her Husband into <hi>Persia,</hi>
where he setled himself very well, by the means of his VVife, who had great VVealth.</p>
                  <p>It must needs be,<note place="margin">The Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> that, of so many VVomen, there are Born a great number of Children.
Accordingly there are some Fathers have 25. or 30. But the modern Education of them differs
much from that of the antients; in as much as now they are not brought up by VVomen, and
the Fathers put them not out till they come to such an age, as they did antiently, when they
admitted them not to their presence till they were four years of age, according to <hi>Strabo,</hi> or five,
according to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> or seaven, according to <hi>Valerius Maximus.</hi> Nor do they now, as
heretofore, exercise them in Shooting and Riding; but they are put, very young, either to
VVork, or to School, to learn to VVrite and Read; there being very few <hi>Persians</hi> who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do both.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Metzid,</hi> or <hi>Mosqueies,</hi> where they say their Prayers, serve them also for Schools.
No City but hath as many <hi>Metzids</hi> as Streets, every street being oblig'd to maintain a <hi>Metzid,</hi>
with the <hi>Molla</hi> belonging to it, who is as it were the Principal of the College, and the <hi>Calife,</hi>
who is the Regent. The <hi>Molla</hi> sits in the middle of the form or Class, and the Scholars all
about him,<note place="margin">Their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors for reading.</note> all along the VValls. As soon as they begin to know the Characters, they put
them to read certain Chapters taken out of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and afterwards the whole <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
Then they put them into the <hi>Kulusthan,</hi> or the Rose-Garden of <hi>Schich Saadi,</hi> and his <hi>Bustan,</hi>
or Orchard, and at last into <hi>Hafis,</hi> who set out the <hi>Bustan</hi> in Rime. These last Authors, who
were both of <hi>Schiras,</hi> which is the antient <hi>Persepolis;</hi> where the Language is more pure than
in any other place of <hi>Persia,</hi> are highly esteem'd, as well for the Excellency of their Style, as
the Praegnancy of their Inventions. The Children read very loud, and all at the same time,
the same Text, moving themselves all with the same agitation from one side to the other, much
after the manner that the VVind shakes Reeds.<note place="margin">Their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> They all write upon their knees where ever they
are, or what age soever they be of, in regard they have not the use of either Stooles or Tables.
They make their Paper of old rags, as we do, which for the most part are of Cotton and Silk,
and that it may not be hairy or uneven,<note place="margin">Their Ink.</note> they make it smooth with a Polishing stone, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with an Oyster or Muscle shell. They make their Ink of the rinds of Pomegranates, or of
Galls and Vitriol, and to make it thick, and more fit for writing, their Characters requiring
a full Body, they burn Rice or Barley, beat it to powder, and make a hard paste of it, which
they dissolve with Gum-water, when they go to write. The best comes from the <hi>Indies,</hi>
which though it be not all equally good and fine, is yet very fit for their Pens, which are not
made of Goose-quills,<note place="margin">And Pens.</note> as ours in <hi>Europe</hi> are, in regard they would be too hard for their Paper,
which, being of Silk or Cotton, is very tender, but they make them of Canes, or Reeds, and a
little bigger than our Pens. They are of a dark Colour without, and they are brought for
the most part from <hi>Schiras,</hi> or from the Gulf of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where there grows abundance of
them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> have their particular Language,<note place="margin">The <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note> which hath much of the <hi>Arabian,</hi> but nothing
at all of the <hi>Turkish.</hi> There are in it also many forein words, as <hi>Germane</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> insomuch
that it might be thought these Languages have the same Original, if it were not found, that it
happen also in almost all the rest, yet not so as that it may be thence inferr'd that all these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
come from the same source. To signifie, Father, Mother, a Tooth, a Pen, a Rat, a Yoak.
they have the same words with the Latine; the <hi>ne</hi> and <hi>tu</hi> are <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> words; and <hi>du,
no, de,</hi> signifie two, nine, and ten: yet is it not to be concluded thence, that the <hi>Persians</hi> are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
<hi>Romans.</hi> True it is, that the <hi>Persians</hi> come from the <hi>Scythians,</hi> as do also the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
yet would I not affirm, that the antient <hi>Goths</hi> and modern <hi>Tartars</hi> are the same people.
It must therefore be granted, that the modern Language of the <hi>Persians</hi> differs much from the
antient, if what <hi>Herodotus</hi> says be true, that all their words ended in S; though it may be
withall confess'd, that they have all a full termination, inasmuch as they have in a manner all
the accent upon the last Syllable. It is easie enough to be learnt, as having but few irregular
Verbs, and if it be true, that it is the same Language which was spoken antiently, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Themistocles</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> make it appear,<note place="margin">The <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> learn the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note> that it may be attain'd in a short time. All
that is hard in it is the Guttural pronunciation thereof.</p>
                  <p>Most of the <hi>Persians,</hi> with their own Language, learn also the <hi>Turkish,</hi> especially in those
Provinces which have been long under the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Grand Seignour,</hi> as <hi>Schiruan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirbeitzan,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47786:155"/>
Erak, Bagdat,</hi> and <hi>Eruan,</hi> where Children are taught the <hi>Turkish</hi> Language, and
by this means, it is so common at Court, that a man seldome hears any one speak the <hi>Persian;</hi>
as in the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi>'s Court, they ordinarily speak the <hi>Sclavonian,</hi> and in the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s, the
<hi>Persian.</hi> But in the Province of <hi>Fars,</hi> which is the antient <hi>Persia,</hi> and at <hi>Schiras,</hi> they speak
only the <hi>Persian</hi> Language. They understand nothing of the <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> or <hi>Latin;</hi> but
instead of these Languages, wherein the <hi>Europaeans</hi> study the Sciences, they have the <hi>Arabian,</hi>
which is to them as the <hi>Latin</hi> is to us; in regard the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and all its Interpreters make use
of it, as do also all those who write any Books of Philosophy and Physick. So that it is not to
be much admir'd,<note place="margin">Their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</note> that it is so common, that indeed they cannot express their own Language,
but in <hi>Arabian</hi> Characters.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true,<note place="margin">Their Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities.</note> the Sciences are not improv'd to that perfection by them as they are by the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paeans,</hi>
yet can it not be said but that the <hi>Persians</hi> are much addicted to Study, and they call
their Learned men <hi>Filosufs.</hi> To this end they have their Colleges, or Universities, which they
call <hi>Medressa,</hi> and the Professors who teach in them, <hi>Mederis.</hi> Their most eminent Colleges
are those of <hi>Ispahan, Schiras, Ardebil, Mesched, Tabris, Caswin, Kom, Iescht,</hi> and <hi>Scama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi>
which are all under the superintendency of the <hi>Sedder,</hi> or chief of their Religion, who is
oblig'd to take care for their allowances and maintenance. This is done out of the Revenue of
those Provinces which pay no Taxes to the King, as <hi>Kochtzeh,</hi> near <hi>Eruan, Vtuathzuk,</hi> near
<hi>Karabath, Tabakmelek,</hi> between <hi>Georgia</hi> and <hi>Karabath, Agdasch,</hi> and <hi>Kermeru.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have a particular inclination for Arithmetick, Geometry, Eloquence, Poetry, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Moral Philosophy, Astronomy, Astrology, Law, and Medicine, in regard they make
some advantage of the Profession of these Sciences. They have all <hi>Aristotles</hi> Philosophy in the
<hi>Arabian</hi> Language, and call it <hi>Dunja piala,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Goblet of the World;</hi> with this
remark upon it, that as a man Drinking out of a great Bowl moderately, finds himself the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for it, and taking so much of it that he is Drunk therewith, he both injures his Body and
disturbs the Mind; so is a man to make a temperate use of the Philosophy of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and,
not deboysting himself, observe a Mediocrity in the Study thereof. Children are taught Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick
in the Schools with their VVriting and Reading. In their accompts, they commonly
make use of the <hi>Indian</hi> figures; but the more Learned use the <hi>Arabian</hi> Characters.</p>
                  <p>They joyn Eloquence and Poesy together, and comprehend these two Sciences under a very
few precepts: which bring a man in a short time to the practick part thereof. And indeed most
of their Eloquent pieces, which they embellish with abundance of Histories, and Moral Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
are in Verse.</p>
                  <p>For the excellency of their Language,<note place="margin">Their best Authors.</note> Pregnancy of conceit, and Elegance of expressions,
they read the <hi>Kulusthan</hi> of <hi>Schich Saadi,</hi> whom they prefer before all their other Authors. It
is a very Eloquent piece, though in Verse, full of figures and enrich'd with History, and Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
of Policy and Morality. Accordingly, there is not any one almost, but hath this Book;
nay some have perus'd and studied it so much, that they have it by Heart, and apply the Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Sentences, and Comparisons thereof, in their ordinary Discourse, so pertinently, that it is no
small pleasure to hear them talk. They are also great Lovers of History, and delight much in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lives and Deaths of their Prophet <hi>Aly</hi> and his Son <hi>Hossein,</hi> who was kill'd in the VVar
against <hi>Iesied;</hi> which pieces are written in a style truly Historical, and of a noble height. They have
also several other Histories, and Chronicles, Ecclesiastical and Prophane, of the Lives and
VVars of their Kings; and some, of the affairs of other forein Nations: the best whereof are
those of <hi>Mirchond, Enweri, Zami, Walchi, Nussegri,</hi> and others. The best of all their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
is <hi>Mirchond,</hi> who hath written the History of <hi>Persia,</hi> in excellent good Language, in
several great Volumes, and it is a piece so highly esteem'd, that it is worth in the Country
above two hundred Crowns; and therefore I cannot think it can be had perfect in <hi>Europe,</hi> though
I know, that <hi>Golius,</hi> Professor of the Oriental Languages and the Mathematicks in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Leyden,</hi> hath most of it, with several other excellent Books of that Nature. But there
is not any man, I know of, that hath so much of it, and makes so great advantages thereof, as
the incomparable Monsieur <hi>Gaulmin,</hi> Counsellor of State, and the Senior of the Masters of
Requests, who though he hath the best Library in <hi>Europe,</hi> for Books of this Nature, yet must it
be acknowledg'd, that he is so perfect a Master of all the Oriental Languages, that he needs not
be oblig'd for ought he can learn out of any of these Authors.</p>
                  <p>I do not give this accompt of their Histories, that a man should give any great credit thereto,
especially when they speak of their Religion and Saints. For in <hi>Persia,</hi> as well as elsewhere,
they have their pious frauds, and think it a kind of Piety to establish and improve the errors of
their Religion, by Fables and Impostures: since that even in their profane Histories, they take
that freedom which is only allow'd Poets and Painters, as may be seen particularly in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, which they have so disguis'd, that it hath no Consonancy to
what is written of him by <hi>Q. Curtius, Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Arrianus.</hi> But though it be not true,
yet it is Divertive enough, at least to excuse, if not deserve, this little Digression.</p>

with his Disciple, that being extreme unwilling to be without him, he oblig'd him to go
along with him in his first Wars, wherein he made great advantages of his advice. For <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
being as yet but fifteen years of age, bethought him one day to ask <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to whom all
<hi>Greece</hi> belong'd, whereto being answer'd by him, that his Grand-father by the Mother-side
had heretofore been Master of it, he, extremely troubled to find himself depriv'd of so great a
Kingdom, resolv'd upon the Reduction and Conquest of it, and afterwards to wage a War
against all the World. To that end, he went, with his Tutor, to <hi>Stampul,</hi> or <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
and made proffer of his service to the King there. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who was one of the most
Eloquent men of his time, knew so well how to recommend the excellent endowments of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
that the King trusted him with the conduct of an Army, wherewith he Conquer'd <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and all the neighbouring Provinces. Afterwards, he conducted that Army against those of the
<hi>Hebbes,</hi> who still made opposition, and making their advantage of their Elephants, rendred all
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s attempts fruitless, till <hi>Aristotle</hi> advis'd him to rub over with <hi>Nefte</hi> a heap of Reeds,
to set them a-fire, and to cast them among the Elephants, which were so startled at the fire,
that they were put into disorder, whereupon the <hi>Hebbes</hi> were defeated, and forc'd to submit.
Thence he went to <hi>Sengebat,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof have great Lips, and very long Teeth.
Their King, with some of his people, got into a Tower, where <hi>Alexander</hi> would have besieg'd
him. But <hi>Aristotle</hi> told him, that being Master of the City, he had cut off the Root of that
Tree, and that it would not be long ere he saw him fall without any further trouble. He took
his advice, and went thence to <hi>Iemen,</hi> and Conquer'd all <hi>Arabia.</hi> He went afterwards to
<hi>Aleppo, Erserum, Diabek,</hi> going on still along the River <hi>Tigris,</hi> as far as <hi>Mosel,</hi> and thence
fell down into <hi>Georgia,</hi> reduc'd all to his Subjection, and came at last to <hi>Berde,</hi> in the Province
of <hi>Iran.</hi> In this City, there lived at that time the Widdow of a certain King, named <hi>Melkcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun,</hi>
who hearing daily of the great wonders done by <hi>Alexander,</hi> employ'd several Painters, to
take his Picture, as also those of all the great Men of her time; insomuch, that <hi>Alexander</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disguiz'd, and in the quality of an Ambassador from <hi>Alexander,</hi> to give her a Visit, the
made a shift to discover him, and invited him to Dine with her. But instead of Meat, there
were brought up only great Basins full of Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones, which she desir'd
him to fall to and to make the best Cheer he could: whereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> telling her, that
there was not any thing could satisfie his hunger, she represented to him, that it was for those
useless trifles that he ruin'd so many Provinces and fruitfull Countries, such as were able to
produce what could maintain many Millions of People, and shew'd him, how that when he
had Conquer'd all the World, he must at last dye for want of Bread, if he still continu'd
the courses he then took, and intreated him not to deprive her of her Kingdom. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
did as she desired; and they talk to this day of the great Wisdom of that Queen, of
whom they relate among other things, that, being very Rich, she did not impose
pecuniary Mulcts upon offenders, but oblig'd them to make Graves for the Burial of the Dead,
and they say there are yet many of those made by her Command to be seen near <hi>Nechtzuan.</hi>
That thence <hi>Alexander</hi> went to <hi>Schiruam,</hi> and built the City of <hi>Derbend,</hi> causing it to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd
on the side towards <hi>Persia,</hi> and drawing a wall all along the Mountain as far as the black
Sea, and building Towers at a League distance one from another, for Guards against the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> That afterwards, he went into <hi>Persia,</hi> became Master of almost all the
Provinces thereof, and engag'd against <hi>Darius,</hi> who was then, with an Army of two hundred
thousand men, in the Province of <hi>Kirman.</hi> That <hi>Darius</hi> had the advantage in the three first
Battels, but was defeated in the fourth. <hi>Alexander</hi> having drawn the Enemie's Army to a place
where he had caus'd several pits to be made, which he had covered with straw, and that <hi>Darius</hi>
was taken in one of them. Afterwards, he went into <hi>Chorasan,</hi> and thence into the <hi>Indies,</hi>
where, upon the intreaty of the <hi>Indians,</hi> he caus'd to be made a Palizado of Iron against the
<hi>Pigmèes,</hi> which is to stand till the day of Judgment. Afterwards, he defeated the <hi>Vsbeques,</hi>
and after that, he turn'd his Arms against the <hi>Hebbes,</hi> who rebell'd against him. That having so
many Kings in his power, he would needs be advis'd by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whether it were not the safest
way to put them to Death. But <hi>Aristotle</hi> having represented to him, that some of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
might come to revenge that cruelty, he set them all at Liberty, except <hi>Darius,</hi> whom he
poyson'd. After this, <hi>Alexander</hi> coming to understand, that, in the Mountain of <hi>Kef,</hi> there
was a great Cave, very black and dark, wherein ran the water of Immortality, would needs take
a Journey thither. But being afraid to lose his way in the Cave, and considering with himself,
that he had committed a great over-sight, in leaving the more aged in Cities and fortify'd pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and keeping about his Person only young people such as were not able to advise him, he
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47786:156"/>
ordered to be brought to him some old Man, whose counsell he might follow in the adventure
he was then upon. There were in the whole Army but two Brothers, named <hi>Chidder</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi>
who had brought their Father along with them, and this good old Man bid his sons go and tell
<hi>Alexander,</hi> that to go through with the design he had undertaken, his only way were, to take
a Mare that had a Colt at her heels, and to Ride upon her into the Cave, and leave the Colt
at the entrance of it, and the Mare would infalliby bring him back again to the same place
without any trouble. <hi>Alexander</hi> thought the advice so good, that he would not take any other
person with him in that Journey but those two Brothers, leaving the rest of his Retinue at the
entrance of the Cave. He advanc'd so far, that he came to a Gate, so well polish'd, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the great darkness, it gave light enough to let him see there was a Bird fasten'd
thereto. The Bird ask'd <hi>Alexander</hi> what he would have? He made answer, that he look'd for
the water of Immortality. The Bird ask'd him, what was done in the World? Mischief enough,
replies <hi>Alexander,</hi> since there is no Vice or Sin but Reigns there. Whereupon the Bird getting
loose and flying away, the Gate opened, and <hi>Alexander</hi> saw an Angel sitting, with a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
in his hand, holding it as if he were going to put it to his Mouth. <hi>Alexander</hi> ask'd him his
name. The Angel made answer, his name was <hi>Raphael,</hi> and that he only staid for a command
from God to blow the Trumpet, and to call the Dead to Judgment. Which having said, he
ask'd <hi>Alexander,</hi> who he was? I am <hi>Alexander,</hi> repli'd he, and I seek the water of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.
The Angel gave him a Stone, and said to him, go thy wayes, and look for another
stone of the same weight with this, and then thou shalt find Immortality. Whereupon <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
asked, how long he had to live? The Angel said to him, till such time as the Heavens and
the Earth which encompass thee, be turn'd to Iron, or as others say, into Gold and Silver.
<hi>Alexander</hi> being come out of the Cave, sought a long time, and not meeting with any stone
just of the same weight with the other, he put one into the Balance which he thought came very
near it, and finging but very litrle difference, he added thereto a little Earth, which made the
Scales even; it being God's Intention to shew <hi>Alexander</hi> thereby, that he was not to expect
Immortality, till he himself were put into the Earth. At last, <hi>Alexander</hi> having, one day, a
fall off his Horse, in the barren ground of <hi>Kur</hi> or <hi>Ghur,</hi> they laid him upon the Coat he wore
over his Armour, and cover'd him with his Buckler, to keep off the heat of the Sun. Others
affirm, that this Coat was Embroider'd with Gold and Silver, and that his Buckler was cover'd
with Plates of the same Mettal, and that then he began to comprehend the Prophecy of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
and was satisfy'd the hour of his Death was at hand, that accordingly he dyed, and that
his Body was carried into <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They add to this Fable, that these two Brothers, <hi>Chidder</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> drunk of the water of
Immortality, and that they are still living, but invisible, <hi>Elias,</hi> upon the earth, and <hi>Chidder,</hi>
in the Water, wherein this latter hath so great power, that those, who are in danger of being
destroy'd by water, if they earnestly pray, saying, <hi>Ia Chidder Nebbs,</hi> vowing a Sacrifice or
Offering to him, and firmly believing, that he can relieve them, shall escape the danger, and
save their Lives. Whence it comes, that, if any one perish, it is attributed to his Incredulity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but if he escape, they are of a certain perswasion, that it is by the assistance of <hi>Chidder,</hi> to whom
those who escape Shipwrack, or any other danger upon the Sea, do every year, upon the same
day, give solemn thanks, and acknowledge the protection of this Saint. These Ceremonies are
performed in <hi>February,</hi> and those who keep the Vows they have made upon such occasions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
their Friends to a Supper, both Men and Women, relate to them the particulars of the
dangers they had been in, and how they were deliver'd out of them, by the means and assistance
of <hi>Chidder.</hi> Then they Sup together, and make good Cheer, but drink no Wine. In the mean
time, they serve up into another Room, several Dishes of Fruit and Conserves, and in the
midst of the room, they set in a Wooden Dish, full of Pease-Meal, a Wax-Candle lighted,
and as they go out of the room, they say, <hi>Chidder Nebbi,</hi> if this offering be acceptable to thee,
shew it by some sign. If, the next day, they find the track of any ones having been in the room,
or the print of a hand in the Meal, it is accounted a very good sign, and the Friends have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meeting, to spend that day in Merriment. Whence it comes, that the Women, who are
not often admitted to these Feasts, find out ways to get into the Room, so as that they are not
perceiv'd, and take away a handful of the Meal, that the Feasting may be continu'd. The
<hi>Nassara,</hi> who are a sort of <hi>Christians,</hi> of <hi>Armenia,</hi> do also celebrate this Festival, but they
drink Wine thereat, which the <hi>Persians</hi> do not. We were told at <hi>Ardebil,</hi> that one day, a
Woman making her advantage of this Feast, had lock'd up her Gallant in the room where they
had prepar'd the entertainment for the Prophet. She went ever and anon to see him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
not that a Child of hers, about four four years of age, follow'd her, who seeing a strange
face, fell a crying, so loud, that the Gallant took an Apple out of the Fruits design'd for <hi>Chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and gave it the Child to make him hold his peace. But as soon as the Child had got the
Apple, he runs into the Hall, where he shew'd his Father the present, which <hi>Chidder Nebbi</hi>
had made him. The Father not knowing what to think of that Vision, and derous to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Chidder</hi> was become visible, went into the room, and there found a man in a posture that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47786:156"/>
a little startled him. But the Gallant, fearing they would have Sacrifiz'd him to the Prophet,
made a shift to get away, and the Woman, pretending she had not seen any thing, it pass'd for
a certain apparition of <hi>Chidder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ther's no Nation in the world more addicted to Poetry than the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Poetry.</note> There you have Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
in all the Market-places, and in all Houses of good fellowship, where they entertain and
make sport for such as frequent them, as the Mountebanks, and such as shew tricks of Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
do in <hi>Europe.</hi> All bear with them, and the Great Lords think they cannot give their
Friends a better entertainment, than by Diverting them, while they are at Dinner, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital
of some Poem. The King himself, and the <hi>Chans</hi> have, among their other Menial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
their Poets, whose only business it is to find out somewhat for their Diversion by whom
they are maintain'd, and which they are not to communicate to any other, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of their Patrons. The Poets are known from others by their Habit, which is the same with
that of the Philophers; to wit, a long white Coat, but open before, with great broad Sleeves,
and they have at their Girdle a kind of a Hawking-bag, in which are their Books, Paper, and an
Ink-horn, that they may give Copies of their verses to such as desire them. Their under Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath no Sleeves, and would be a perfect Cloak, if it had but a Cape. They wear no
Stockings; their Breeches come down to their feet, like Pantaloons, and in winter, they
wear such as reach but to their ankles. Instead of <hi>Mendils</hi> or <hi>Turbants,</hi> they wear a kind of
Caps. Those who put off their Productions in the Market places and at Taverns, wear Skarfs
of several Colours, which come about their Bodies just above the waste, and passing over the
right shoulder fall down under the left arm, Most of these take for the Subject of their Poetry
the Religion of the <hi>Turks</hi> and their Saints, which they are pleas'd to rail at and make sport
withall.</p>
                  <p>It may well be imagin'd, that, among so many Poets, there must also be some Poetasters, and
that there, as well as in other places, a man must expect to find but few <hi>Homers</hi> and <hi>Virgils.</hi>
Nay there are some so modest as to vent only the works of other Men, and finding in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
such a barrenness of wit as will not produce any thing, make it their business to disperse
their productions who are in repute. <hi>Persia</hi> hath this common with <hi>France,</hi> as indeed it hath
many other things, that it hath hardly any Author excellent at an Epick Poem, and that some
few Poets laid a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ide, who are in great reputation, the rest are rather to be pittied. The best,
and such as may justly be accounted good Poets,<note place="margin">The best <hi>Persian</hi> Poets.</note> are <hi>Saadi, Hafis, Firdausi, Fussuli, Chagani,
Eheli, Schems, Naway, Scabidi, Ferahsed, Deheki, Nessimi,</hi> &amp;c. Their Poetry is suitable to the
modern way, and they will keep up the Rime, though they are not very exact in observing the
number of the Syllables. Nor do they think it much to use the same words to keep the Rime,
as imagining it no breach of the Rules of their Prosodia; as for example in the following Verses:
<q>
                        <l>Tziri, tziri, Tziragh Iani tze?</l>
                        <l>Adamir a demagh Iani tze?</l>
                        <l>Tziri, tziri, tziragh es teri bud,</l>
                        <l>Adamira demagh cheri bud.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where the Poet makes a pretty allusion between the words <hi>Teri</hi> and <hi>Cheri,</hi> whereof one sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
moist, and the other, of or belonging to an Ass. The sense of the Verses, is to this effect;
<hi>Why does the Candle go out? Why does man boast and is vain-glorious? because the one wants
moist Suet, and the other is troubled with Asse's fat.</hi> They also delight much in Equivocations,
and many times very handsomely begin the subsequent Verse with the word that ended the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
as in the following Example.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Kalem be dest, debiran behes hasar derem</l>

                  <p>Their Study of the Law can be of no great extent,<note place="margin">Their Law.</note> in regard they have but few Laws, and
those they have are all taken out of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and the Commentaries upon it: which the
<hi>Kasis</hi> and the <hi>Divanbegs</hi> observe, in the decision of differences. They have besides these, certain
Local customs, but very few.</p>
                  <p>In Physick,<note place="margin">Medicine.</note> or Medicine, they follow the Maxims of <hi>Avicenna,</hi> and their Physicians are all
<hi>Galenists.</hi> Phlebotomy is not very ordinary among them, but they administer continual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
made of Herbs and Roots, and many times apply Fomentations and other outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
They have nothing of Anatomy, and their practice is so gross, that, when I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at
<hi>Scamachie,</hi> where our Physician was intreated to visit a Man, who, having drunk too much A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quavitae,
lay a dying, I saw a Moor-Physician, who had the sick party in hand, order a great
piece of Ice to be laid on his Stomack, maintaining his proceedure by this general Maxim, that
a Disease is to be Cur'd by what is contrary thereto. When Women or Children are troubled
with any Disease or Indisposition, they do not send for a Physician, but for the Midwife, whence
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47786:157"/>
it comes that Midwives have some skill in Medicine. The Books which treat thereof,
have this extraordinary, that, the remedies they prescribe, are as fit for Horses as
Men.</p>
                  <p>Our Physician, who had joyned to <hi>Galen</hi>'s method certain Maxims of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> and us'd
Chymical remedies with very good success, grew so famous in <hi>Persia,</hi> that the King himself
proffer'd him very considerable allowances, to engage him to continue in that Court. Nay,
he grew into such repute, after he had recover'd some persons who had been given over by
others, that the people began to look upon him as an extraordinary man, insomuch that they
brought to him some that were lame and blind from the Birth, to recover their limbs and sight
who never had had them.</p>
                  <p>It is not of late that the <hi>Persians</hi> have apply'd themselves to the study of Astronomy.<note place="margin">Astronomy.</note> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
they who made profession thereof were called <hi>Magi,</hi> and now they call them <hi>Minat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi>
and they do not busie themselves so much in observing the motions of the Heavens and
Stars, and the pure contemplation of that Science, as in Prognosticating the effects which their
influences may produce, and to fore-tell those things, the contingency whereof they imagine to
themselves may be read in the course of the Heavens. So that it is rather Judiciary Astrology,
than Astronomy that they now Study, in regard the one would bring them no advantage at all,
whereas the other is the more beneficial to them in this respect, that most of the <hi>Persians</hi> have
this superstition, that they never undertake any thing of consequence, but they first consult the
<hi>Minatzi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> To that end, the King and Great Lords have alwayes one of these about them,
who perpetually observes the Heavens, and fore-tells whether the time be fortunate or unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
for the business they would undertake. And out of that reflection it is, that they say
themselves, that Astrology, who is dependent on Astronomy, is a rich Daughter, but comes
from so poor a Mother, that she is forc'd to preserve her Life, from whom she receiv'd her
own. These Astrologers are never without their Astrolabe, which they carry in their Bosoms,
that they may erect a Scheme at any time: but their skill is not great about Nativities, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
those of persons of mean condition; which proceeds hence, that, having no Clocks, they
cannot get the precise hour, much less the minute of the Birth, which great persons have exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observ'd, by means of the Astrolabe.</p>
                  <p>For the teaching of Astronomy they have neither Sphear nor Globe, insomuch that they
were not a little astonish'd to see in my hands a thing which is so common in <hi>Europe.</hi> I ask'd
them whether they had ever seen any such before. They told me, they had not, but said, that there
was heretofore in <hi>Persia,</hi> a very fair Globe, which they call <hi>Felek,</hi> but that it was lost during
the Warrs between them and the <hi>Turks.</hi> They haply meant that which <hi>Sapor,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi>
had caus'd to be made of Glass, so large, that he could sit in the Centre of it, and observe the
motions of the Stars, and must no doubt be like that of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> whereof <hi>Claudian</hi> speaks
in the Epigram, which begins thus,
<q>Iupiter in parvo cum cernerct aethera vitro.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Antiquity might haply admire these works; but what miracle would it be thought, if they
saw the Globe which his Highness the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> hath ordered to be made in his City of
<hi>Gottorp.</hi> It is a double Globe, made of Copper, ten foot and a half Diameter, so that within
it, ten persons may sit at a Table, which, with the seats about it, hangs at one of its poles.
There a man may see, by means of an Horizontal Circle within the Globe, how the Stars and
the Sun it self, coming out of its Centre, moves of it self through its Ecliptick degrees, and
rises and sets regularly. The motion of this Globe exactly follows that of the Heavens, and
derives that motion from certain Wheels, driven by the water, which is brought out of a
Mountain hard by, and let in, as it requires more or less, according to the swiftness of the
Sphears.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> regulate their year according to the Moon,<note place="margin">The Lunar and Solar year in <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </note> as well as the Sun, so as that they
have both Solar and Lunar years; to wit, the latter, for their Festivals, and Religious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
which are appointed on certain dayes of the Moneth, and these Moneths beginning and
ending with the Moon, make their year shorter than ours by twelve dayes. Their Solar year
is of 365. dayes, and was so accounted even in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, as <hi>Q. Curtius</hi>
expressly observes in the 7. Chap. of the 3. Book of his History, where he sayes, speaking of
<hi>Darius</hi>'s Retinue, that, after the <hi>Magi,</hi> follow'd three hundred sixty five young Men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
the number of the dayes of their year, which consisted of so many dayes, that is to say,
twelve Moneths of thirty dayes a piece, and five dayes over and above. It begins, at that very
minute that the Sun, entring into <hi>Aries,</hi> makes the Equinox, and brings in the first day of the
Spring. That day they call <hi>Naurus,</hi> or <hi>Neurus,</hi> that is, the new day. They count the years
of their age, according to the course of the Sun, so that to express how old they are, they say,
they have liv'd so many <hi>Narus</hi>'s, that is, so many years. It is one of the principal functions of
the <hi>Minatzim,</hi> to observe, by the Astrolabe, the happy minute, in which the Sun comes to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47786:157"/>
the Aequator, and as soon as he declares it is, they all begin to rejoyce. Their Epoche is
the <hi>Hegira,</hi> or flight of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which falls on the 10. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the 622. year of our
Saviour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> had heretofore their Almanack, or <hi>Takhuim,</hi> which was particular to them,
and every day of the Moneth had its name from some of their Kings or Heroes, as <hi>Oromasda,
Behemer, Adarpahascht, Scharias,</hi> &amp;c. as we find it in <hi>Scaliger,</hi> in his incomparable Treatise,
<hi>de Emendatione Temporum,</hi> and in the Ephemerides of <hi>Origanus:</hi> but they are not used now,
no more than the Epoche of <hi>Iesdetzird,</hi> or as <hi>Scaliger</hi> calls him, <hi>Iesdegird,</hi> who was the Son

on the 16. of <hi>Iune</hi> in the 632. They had no other till the year 1079. at which time
<hi>Albu Arsalan,</hi> King of <hi>Chorasan, Mesopotamia</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> a <hi>Sarasin,</hi> having brought together
eight Astronomers, very Learned Men, reform'd the year of <hi>Iesdegird,</hi> and constituted another
Epoche, which they began on the 14. day of the year, and which is called <hi>Tzelalee,</hi> or <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thance,</hi>
or, in the <hi>Arabian, Tarich, altzelalit,</hi> that is, the <hi>Era,</hi> or <hi>Epoche,</hi> of <hi>Augustus,</hi> from
the word <hi>Tzelaf,</hi> which signifies Majesty, or Highness. Now, they have the <hi>Arabian</hi> Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the names of their twelve Moneths are, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Tzemadi Ewel, Tzemadi Achir, Retzeb, Scabahn, Schawal, Dsilkade,</hi> and <hi>Dsilhatse.</hi> It is
also to be observ'd, that the <hi>Persians</hi> have a way of accompting by four years, much after the
same manner as the <hi>Greeks</hi> accompted by their <hi>Olympiads,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> by <hi>Lustra,</hi> which
consisted of five years, and then they give the first year of their accompt, the name of the first
Moneth of the year, to the four ensuing years, that of the second Moneth, and so of the rest;
so that to know that they speak of a Moneth, and not of years, they add, to the names of the
Moneths, the word <hi>Mah,</hi> which signifies a Moneth. <hi>Abraham Ecchelensis</hi> gives the Etymology
of it, as he does also that of the dayes of the week, in his <hi>History of Arabia,</hi> pag. 204. &amp;c.
They begin the week with Saturday, that the seventh day, which is the day of rest, may fall
upon Friday, which to them is as the Sunday is to <hi>Christians,</hi> and Saturday to the <hi>Iews.</hi> The
names of the seven dayes of the week are these, to wit, Saturday, <hi>Scembe,</hi> Sunday, <hi>Iekschembe,</hi>
Monday, <hi>Duschembe,</hi> Tuesday, <hi>Seschembe,</hi> Wednesday, <hi>Tschaschembe,</hi> Thursday, <hi>Denschem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be,</hi>
and Friday, <hi>Adine,</hi> or <hi>Tzumeh,</hi> that is, the day of Assembly, in regard that on that day,
they meet at their Assemblies to do their Devotions. They account <hi>Tscharchembe</hi> the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
day of all the Week.</p>
                  <p>They are extremely addicted to Astrology, and in imitation of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> of whom,
doubtless, they learnt that Science, they are so superstitious, that they do not only credit all
the Astrologers tell them, but also, persons of quality do no business of any consequence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
no journey, nay would be loath to put on a new Garment, get on Horse-back to Ride
abroad, or Bath themselves, but they first consult the <hi>Minatzim,</hi> who is so much the more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
by them, in that many times they heighten the Vanity of their Art by a Profession, no
less deceitful than the other, which is Medicine. This perswasion of theirs is grounded on the
opinion they have, as well as the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that the Stars are governed by Intelligences, who
have an absolute power over sublunary things; so that it is no hard matter to make them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in the prediction of the Astrologers. These are either Mountebanks, or Magicians,
who, by their equivocal expressions circumvent those who consult them, purposely to disturb
their Brains, and to put tricks upon them, as <hi>Stephen Alexander</hi> did upon <hi>Heraclius,</hi> when he
fore-told him, that he should perish in the water, obliging him thereby to fill up all the Lakes
and Ponds all over the Empire. After the same manner was also deceived <hi>Iohn Menard,</hi> a
Physician of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who was told he should perish in a Ditch. He avoided them all, but that
of a young Woman, whom he Married in his old age, and who visibly shor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ned his dayes.
They attribute to every hour in the day one of the Signs of the Zodiack, to wit, to the first,
<hi>Aries,</hi> to the second, <hi>Taurus,</hi> and so forward; and they believe there are in every Moneth,
some unfortunate dayes, especially the 3. the 5. and the 23. and 25. of every Moon. <hi>Abraham
Ecchelensis,</hi> whom we cited before, relates, to this purpose, two remarkable stories, taken
out of the 9. Book of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of <hi>Gregorius Barhebra,</hi> where he sayes, that in the 198.
year of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> there liv'd a Man, who, among other things, had a Ring, which made
him that had it on his Finger laugh as long as it was on. He himself was the onely man who
could use it as another Ring; and he had also a Pen, wherewith no body could Write, and
which no body was able to guide with his hand, but he himself. Whence it came, that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lif,
Alamun,</hi> who liv'd in that time, would needs have his Nativity calculated by the famous
Astrologer <hi>Albumazar,</hi> who found that his Ascendent was in <hi>Taurus,</hi> between whom and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,
cauda draconis</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> there was a benevolent aspect, and that the Sun and Moon
were in the same degree of the Ascendent. The other Story is of a Physician, named <hi>Tabet Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rensis,</hi>
who feeling a man's Pulse, told him he had eaten Veal, and taken of a Broath, whereof
the Milk was turn'd in the boyling, yet had not any reason to give for what he said, save that
the Physician knew it by some particular instinct, and that he had receiv'd that gift from secret
influence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:47786:158"/>
Yet for all this prejudice they have for the influences of the Stars, they attribute much to
Chance, and endeavour to discover the secrets of things by those means, especially such as are
not yet come to pass, the knowledge whereof is not so easie.</p>
                  <p>Tis true, they are for the most part Women, who address themselves to these people, who
have their Shops or Stalls in the <hi>Maidan,</hi> near the <hi>Dowlet Chane,</hi> and fore-tell things by Lot,
two manner of wayes. Some of them, whom they call <hi>Remal,</hi> have seven or eight Dice strung
together upon two little pieces of Wire, and they predict according to the falling of the Dice.
The others, whom they call <hi>Falkir,</hi> do their work with much more Ceremony. For they have
before them, upon a Table, thirty or forty little pieces of board, about an inch square, very
thinn and very smooth, which are mark'd with certain Characters on that side which lies down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Upon one of these little pieces of board, he who desires to know what is to befall him,
is to lay down his Money, which the <hi>Falkir</hi> immediately puts up, and no doubt this is that
which is most certain in the whole Mystery. That done, he turns over a Book that lies before
him, about three fingers thick, the leaves whereof are Painted with all sorts of Figures, as
Angels, Devils, Satyrs, Dragons and other Monsters, and he opens the Book several times, till
he finds one that hath some rapport to the Characters upon the little board. Neither is that done
without Muttering between his teeth certain inarticulate and not intelligible words; and this is
the most infallible prediction they have among them.</p>
                  <p>The political Government of <hi>Persia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </note> differs not much from that of the <hi>Muscovites.</hi> Both are
Monarchical, and so Despotick, that the Prince governs with an absolute power, making his
Will a Law, and, without any accompt to be given of his so doing, disposing of the Lives and
Estates of his Subjects; who are so far his Slaves, that they do not so much as murmur at the
Violence, wherewith the greatest Lords of the Kingdom are put to Death, without any kind of
proceedings against them.</p>
                  <p>They call their Kings <hi>Schach, Paschach,</hi> and <hi>Padischach,</hi> words which have in a manner all
the same signification, to wit, that of King, or Lord. Yet does not the Emperour of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> when he writes to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> give him the quality of <hi>Schach,</hi> but that of <hi>Schich
Ogli,</hi> that is to say, Ecclesiastick, or Son, or Kinsman, of the Prophet. Those who say,
the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> assume the quality of <hi>Choda,</hi> that is God, are mistaken. For <hi>Chodabende</hi> is
the proper name of a man, as <hi>Theodosius, Theodore,</hi> &amp;c. and signifies, <hi>oblig'd to God,</hi> or a
<hi>Servant of God;</hi> though it must be confess'd, that these Princes are Vain-Glorious enough to
assume extravagant Titles which make them equal to the Sun and Moon, and Companions of
the Stars; <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> saies of <hi>Sapor,</hi> King of <hi>Persia.</hi> Tis true on the other
side, that they are as free to give the same Titles to those Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> with whom they
live in good correspondence: for in the Letters which <hi>Schach Sefi</hi> writ to the Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi>
he gave him the same qualities he assum'd himself. They would not have inscriptions of Letters
fill'd with the Titles of the Kingdoms and Provinces under their Jurisdiction: nay <hi>Schach-Abas</hi>
would have no other title at the head of a Petition than that of <hi>Schach,</hi> and one day said to a
man that had set several titles at the head of his Petition, Go thy wayes, friend, thy titles
will make me neither more powerfull nor more poor; Give me that of <hi>Schach,</hi> since I am so,
and think that enough.</p>
                  <p>Most Authors give the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> of the last Race the quality of <hi>Sophi;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi.</hi>
                     </note> and the Kings
themselves, especially those who have any zeal for their Religion, are much pleas'd with the
addition of that quality to their titles, out of the affection they bear <hi>Schich Sofi,</hi> or <hi>Sefi,</hi> the
first Institutor of their Sect; as the Kings of <hi>France</hi> take the quality of <hi>most Christian;</hi> those of
<hi>Spain,</hi> that of most <hi>Catholick,</hi> and those of <hi>England,</hi> that of <hi>Defenders of the Faith.</hi> Whence
they say, <hi>Ismael-Sofi, Eider-Sofi:</hi> and of this a man must taxe notice in the reading of their
History, inasmuch as if he do not, he may confound the Names of the Kings, and attribute that
to one which is to be understood of another.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Persia</hi> is Hereditary,<note place="margin">The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Persia</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary.</note> and may be enjoy'd, not only by the Children lawfully
begotten, but also, for want of such, by natural Children, and the Sons of Concubines, who
inherit the Crown as well as the others, nay they are preferr'd before the nearest of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
Kinred, and the Nephews; since the Sons of Concubines and Slaves are not accounted
illegitimate in <hi>Persia,</hi> as we have said elsewhere. For want of Sons, the Crown falls to the
next of Kin by the Father's side, descended from <hi>Sefi,</hi> who are as it were Princes of the Blood-Royal,
and are called <hi>Schich Eluend.</hi> They enjoy many great Privileges and Immunities, but
many times, they are very poor, and have much ado to live. The Children of the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi>
make the Houses where they are Born, Free, and they are converted into Sanctuaries; insomuch
that if the Queen be delivered in any other place besides the Metropolis, the House is compass'd
with a noble VVall, to be distinguish'd from others.</p>
                  <p>If we may credit <hi>Q. Curtius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The arms of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </note> the antient Arms of <hi>Persia</hi> were the Crescent, as the Sun was
that of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Now, the <hi>Turks</hi> take the Crescent, and the <hi>Persians,</hi> the Sun, which they
commonly put upon the back of a Lion. But upon the great Seal of the Kingdom there are only
Characters, It is about the bigness of a half Crown piece, having within the Ring; <hi>To God
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47786:158"/>
alone, I Schich Sefi am a Slave with all my Heart:</hi> and in the Circumference; <hi>Aly, let the
World say what it please of Thee, yet will I be thy Friend. He who before thy Gate does not account
himself dust and ashes, though he were an Angel, dust and ashes be upon his Head.</hi> In the Letters he
sends to <hi>Christian</hi> Princes, he observes this respect, that he does not set the Seal on the same
side with the Writing, but on the other side, at the very bottom.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremonies performed at the Coronation of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of their Kings.</note> are not done at <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
as some Authors would have it believ'd, nor yet at <hi>Kufa,</hi> as <hi>Minadous</hi> affirms,
but in the City of <hi>Ispahan.</hi> They are not so great as those done at the Inauguration of
Kings in <hi>Europe.</hi> They set upon a Table, about half an Ell high, as many pieces of Tapistry
of Gold an Silver, or Embroider'd as there have been Kings of the same Family, before him
who is then to be Crowned; so that at the Coronation of <hi>Schach Sefi,</hi> there were eight;
inasmuch as he was the eighth King of <hi>Persia</hi> of that House, accompting from <hi>Ismael</hi> the first.
That done, the chiefest of the <hi>Chans</hi> present him with a Crown, which he kisses thrice, in
the Name of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and of <hi>Aaly,</hi> and having put it to his Fore-head, he delivers
it to the Grand Master of the Kingdom, whom they call <hi>Lele,</hi> who puts it on his Head; and
then all present make Acclamations, of <hi>Long live the King; God grant, that, during his
Reign, one year may be multiply'd to a thousand;</hi> they kiss his Feet, make him great Presents,
and spend the remainder of the day in Feasting and Merriment. There is no such thing among
them as the taking of any Oath of Allegiance, or obliging the King to swear to the Conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Privileges, or Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, in regard their subjection is
pure Slavery; whereas among <hi>Christians,</hi> the condition of Kings is quite otherwise, for the
obligation is reciprocal, and the Kings are not absolute Lords, but are, or ought to be, Fathers
of their people.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom is of great extent. Those Provinces which lie most remote from the chief
Citie, and the ordinary residence of the Kings, cannot be governed otherwise than by Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
or Lieutenants, who, in <hi>Persia,</hi> are called <hi>Chans;</hi> the word not signifying the imployment
they have in the said Governments, but a quality which all great Lords assume to themselves.
Of this we shall speak more at large elsewhere, and here give a short accompt of the Kings of
<hi>Persia</hi> who have reign'd within these hundred years; with some assurance, that the Reader will
think this digression the less tedious, when he finds me positively affirming, that there is hardly
any Author who hath written the History of them. We said before that the Emperour of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> when he writes to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> give him not the quality of <hi>Schach,</hi> but of
<hi>Schich-Ogli,</hi> in as much as he is not descended from the antient Family of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi>
but from a later,<note place="margin">Ismael<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hassan Padschach,</hi> who was sirnamed <hi>Vssum Cassan,</hi> that is to say <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> by reason
of the great Wars he managed, and where in he was alwayes victorious, was of the Family
of the <hi>Asimbels,</hi> and liv'd about the end of the fifteenth age. He was Governour of <hi>Armenia
Major,</hi> and having gain'd several victories over the <hi>Turks,</hi> he reduc'd several Poovinces by
force of Arms, and among others, <hi>Persia,</hi> whereof he made himself King. <hi>Vssum Cassan</hi>
had three sons, <hi>Vnger Mahomed, Calul,</hi> and <hi>Iacup.</hi> The first was strangled by the Father's
order,<note place="margin">Iacup.</note> against whom he had taken up Arms; and the second was poyson'd by the third; so
that <hi>Vssum Cassan</hi> dying, on the fifth of <hi>Ianuary 1485. Iacup</hi> succeeded him: but he enjoy'd
not long the Kingdom he had got with the price of his Brother's bloud; for his own Wife poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
him within a short time after his coming to the Crown. After his death, <hi>Schich Eider,</hi>
son-in-law to <hi>Vsum Cassan,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Harduellis,</hi> from the place of his birth, pretended to
the succession; but it was disputed against him, first by <hi>Iulaver,</hi> a <hi>Persian</hi> Lord, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by <hi>Baylinger,</hi> and <hi>Rustan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> who slighted <hi>Schich Eider,</hi> by reason of the meanness of his birth, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
which <hi>Vssum Cassan</hi> had bestow'd on him his Daughter <hi>Martha,</hi> whom he had had
by <hi>Despina,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Calojean,</hi> King of <hi>Trebisond</hi>) and hated him, particularly upon
this accompt, that he had quitted their Religion, presuming that a man, who pretended
much to Devotion and Sanctity, would be unexpert, if not unfortunate in the business of
Arms, declar'd a war against him, entred <hi>Persia</hi> with a powerfull Army, gave him battel, and
defeated him, in so much that falling alive into their hands, they flead his head and pull'd down
his skin over his ears. 'Tis true, there is so great discrepancy among the <hi>Persian</hi> Authors,
concerning this story, that we have been forc'd herein to follow the common opinion; though
there are some who affirm, that <hi>Eider</hi> was not King, but that <hi>Rustan,</hi> King of <hi>Persia</hi> fearing
he might come to be King, treated him as we said before. Nay, some affirm, that this happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the time of <hi>Iacup,</hi> the son of <hi>Vssum Cassan.</hi> But what cannot well be deny'd of the story,
is, that, about that time, the <hi>Turks</hi> became Masters of most of the Provinces of <hi>Persia;</hi> and
that <hi>Rustan</hi> was succeeded by <hi>Agmar,</hi>

<hi>Schach,</hi> or King, left one son named <hi>Ismael:</hi> but he was so young, when his Father
died, that all could be done for him, was to secure his person at the house of a certain
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47786:159"/>
Lord of the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> a Kinsman and Friend of his Father's, named <hi>Pyr Chalim,</hi>
who brought him up, and instructed him in the same Sect his Father had been of. <hi>Ismael</hi>
being come to years of discretion, discover'd himself to be a person of an excellent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and great courage, and there were the greater hopes conceiv'd of him, out of this
respect, that his Father, who was well skill'd in Astrology, had Predicted that his son should
do wonders, as being the person designed for the restauration of <hi>Persia,</hi> by the reduction of
many Provinces, and the propagation he should make of his new Religion. Accordingly, he
made such advantage of the opportunity he then had, while the Emperour of the <hi>Turks</hi> was at
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> little thinking what might happen towards <hi>Persia,</hi> that having, by the advice
of <hi>Pyr,</hi> sent Deputies into the neighbouring Provinces and Cities, he so far satisfy'd them of
the right he had to the Crown, and prevail'd with them to reflect on the interest of the State,
and the preservation of Religion, that having got together an Army of twenty thousand men,
with which he left <hi>Latretzan,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> the Inhabitants of the other Provinces
came in so fast, that it was, of a sudden swell'd to three hundred thousand. With this Army,
he marched streight to <hi>Ardebil,</hi> whence he forc'd away all the <hi>Turks,</hi> some few onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
who were got into a street behind <hi>Schich Sefi's</hi> Sepulchre, where they Petition'd for
their lives, and promised to Embrace the <hi>Persian</hi> Religion: and thence it comes, that the said
street is, to this day, called <hi>Vrume Mahele.</hi> It was upon this exploit that many <hi>Persians</hi>
came to be sirnamed <hi>Kisilbaschs,</hi> as we have shewn before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ardebil</hi> being thus reduc'd, <hi>Ismael</hi> went to <hi>Tabris Scamachie,</hi> and <hi>Iruan,</hi> and recover'd all
the Cities and Provinces which the <hi>Truks</hi> had taken from his Father, and had been possess'd of
ever since his death. He afterwards entred into <hi>Turkey,</hi> gave the Emperour battel, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
him. The particulars of that War may be seen in the Letter which <hi>Henry Penia,</hi> who
was then in <hi>Persia,</hi> writ to Cardinal <hi>Sauli;</hi> and they agree with what the <hi>Persians</hi> themselves
write thereof. After this Victory he took <hi>Bagdat, Besre, Kurdestan, Diarbek, Wan, Esserum,
Ersingan. Bitlis, Adiltschouas, Alchat, Berdigk, Kars, Entakie.</hi> As soon as he had secur'd
the Frontiers against the attempts of the <hi>Turks,</hi> he turn'd his Armies Eastward, and took,
from the King of the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Province of <hi>Candahar,</hi> and the next adjoyning Province, the
same good success, which he had had against the <hi>Turks,</hi> still attending him. 'Twas after this
last Conquest that he went to <hi>Caswin,</hi> to be Crown'd. He stay'd there but just the time requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
for that Ceremony, and to refresh his Forces, with which he afterwards went into <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
Defeated the King of that Countrey, whom the Histories call <hi>Simon Padschach,</hi> and
forc'd him to pay him, yearly, three hundred <hi>Bails</hi> of Silk, by way of Tribute. The
difficulties which <hi>Schach Ismael Sofi</hi> met with in all these Wars, were not so small but the
<hi>Persians</hi> grew weary of them, though the zeal of their Religion induc'd them to suffer the
utmost extremities; even death it self, with resolution enough. But the consequence of these
Victories, and the good success which <hi>Ismael</hi> had in all his designs, was, that they raised him to
so high an esteem, that all the other Princes of <hi>Asia,</hi> nay, several Monarchs of <hi>Europe</hi>
courted his friendship, by solemn Embassies, which gave our Writers the first acquaintance
they had with the affairs of <hi>Persia.</hi> And whereas he made a strict Profession of the <hi>Persian</hi>
Religion, and had a great Devotion for <hi>Aly,</hi> so far as to assume the quality of <hi>Sofi,</hi> thence it
comes, that our Historians speak of him as the principal Propagator, nay, indeed, as the first
Institutor of that Sect. He died at <hi>Caswin,</hi> in the forty fifth year of his age, and was buried
at <hi>Ardebil.</hi> He had the reputation of being a great observer of Justice, but it is affirm'd of
him, that he made no great difficulty to drink Wine, and eat Swines flesh; nay, that, in
derision of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Religion, he had a Hog kept in his Court, which he named <hi>Bajazeth.</hi>

                     <hi>Schach Ismael Sofi</hi> left four Sons, whereof the eldest, named <hi>Tamas,</hi> succeeded his Father
in the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Schach Tamas.</note> but not in the vertues and great endowments, which had made him
considerable all over the World. The three others, to wit, <hi>Helcasi, Beiram,</hi> and <hi>Sor-Myrza,</hi>
had certain Territories assign'd them. This change was perceiv'd at the very beginning of his
Government. For <hi>Sulthan Solyman,</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> taking notice of the weakness
of <hi>Schach Tamas</hi> in matter of Government, raised a powerfull Army, enters the Kingdom of
<hi>Persia,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Sulthan Murat Bascha,</hi> and recover'd from the <hi>Persiaus</hi> all
that <hi>Schach Ismael</hi> had taken from the <hi>Turks, Bagdan</hi> and <hi>Wan</hi> onely excepted. Two years after
<hi>Solyman</hi> came in person into <hi>Persia,</hi> where he took <hi>Tauris,</hi> and besieg'd <hi>Sulthania, Schach
Tamas,</hi> who was in the mean time at <hi>Caswin,</hi> having not so much courage as to raise the Siege.
But as good fortune would have it, it happened, that during the time of the Siege, in the
moneth of <hi>March,</hi> some few dayes before their <hi>Naurus,</hi> there fell so great a Rain, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
by such a violent Tempest, that the Snow of the adjacent Mountains dissolving, and
the water over-flowing all the Valleys, <hi>Soliman</hi> who was incommodated thereby; and fround
the water of a reddish colour, contracted haply from the ground, through which it had pass'd,
was frightned thereat, raised the Siege, and departed the Kingdom. In his retreat, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
all before him, but was engag'd neer <hi>Bitlis,</hi> where he was absolutely defeated. <hi>Schach
Tamas</hi> dying the 11. of <hi>May</hi> 1576. in the <hi>68th.</hi> year of his age, and the <hi>42th.</hi> of his
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47786:159"/>
reign, left a very ill repute of himself among the <hi>Persians,</hi> who speak of him with some preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
as well in relation to his Conduct, as his Courage. They change him, among other
things, that he was very careless of doing Justice to his Subjects, and had committed the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the affairs of his kingdom to his Ministers, as they are ordinarily wont to do, who
cannot love a people that hath no affection for them. They blame him for protecting <hi>Hama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jum,</hi>
the Son of <hi>Selim,</hi> king of the <hi>Indies,</hi> to whom he gave Refuge and Protection, against
the Persecutions of <hi>Tzelaleden Ekbet,</hi> his Uncle, a younger Brother of <hi>Selim</hi>'s, who had usurp'd
the Crown, and demanded him of <hi>Schach-Tamas,</hi> that he might be put to death. But that was
a generous and just action, and is not to be produc'd among the examples that are alleged of his
violence and injustice, especially with any parallel to the ensuing story.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lavassap,</hi> Prince of <hi>Armenia,</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and left the former, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Elder, the Government of the Country. <hi>David,</hi> who had too much courage to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with a small Territory, found means to raise an Army, such as might frighten his Elder
Brother, who, being really afraid of an insurrection, desir'd the assistance of <hi>Schach Tamas,</hi>
who sent him four thousand Horse, ordering him who had the Conduct of them, if possible, to
take <hi>David</hi> alive, and send him to him, nay, to Crown him, in case he should comply so far
as to be Circumcised, but with this Proviso, that he should prefer <hi>Simon,</hi> if he would take the
Crown upon the same terms. <hi>David</hi> being taken in the first Engagement, soon hearkened to
the King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s Proposition, and promis'd to change his Religion, and do homage for his
Province, if the King would establish him in his Brother place. <hi>Simon</hi> express'd a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
and would not change his Religion; whereupon he was imprison'd, in the Fortress of
<hi>Kahak;</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> who after his Circumcision was called <hi>Dant-Chan,</hi> was forc'd to content
himself with the Government of <hi>Tiflis. Simon</hi> remain'd some time a prisoner; but the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had of being a good Soldier, and a knowing person, brought him, first, acquainted, and
afterwards very intimate with <hi>Schach Ismael</hi> the second, the Son of <hi>Schach Tamas,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to deliver him out of the Captivity, which he was to expect should have lasted as long as
he liv'd, and to restore him to his Territories, if he would change his Religion. He did so, at
left in outward thew, but <hi>Ismael</hi> dying soon after, he was little the better for his Promises.
He was indeed set at liberty some time after his death; but <hi>Chodabende,</hi> coming to the Crown,
minded not much the performance of his Brother's promises, and forc'd <hi>Simon</hi> to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the employment he bestow'd on him in the Wars he was then engag'd in against the
<hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Schach Tamas</hi> had by several Wives eleven Sons, and three Daughters, and among the rest,
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> on whom upon his having shaken hands with all business, by reason of the weakness
of his sight, and embracing a devout kind of life, they bestow'd the Sirname of <hi>Chodabende,</hi> that
is <hi>(servant of God) Ismael,</hi> and <hi>Eider. Tamas</hi> had a particular kindness for <hi>Eider,</hi> his third
Son, and it was his design to prefer him before the two Elder in the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and to make the more sure work, he permitted him, even in his life time, to assume some
part thereof. But after his death, the Lords of the Countrey sent to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to desire him to
accept of the Crown, which was his right by birth; and upon his refusal, they sent to <hi>Ismael,</hi>
who was, by his Father's order a Prisoner in the Castle of <hi>Cahak,</hi> for having, upon his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
made incursions into the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions, though, in his Soul, he had an aversion for
the <hi>Persian</hi> Religion, and in effect made profession of the <hi>Turkish. Eider,</hi> who was but seventeen
years of age, was so impatient to get into the Throne, that he had the insolence to put the
Crown on his head, and present himself, in that posture, before his Father, who was then near
his death; and desirous to make his advantage of <hi>Ismael</hi>'s absence, and <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s refusal,
made use of the interest which <hi>Periaconcona,</hi> his Sister, had with the Grandees, to mount the
Throne. The Princess, who had declar'd for the interest of the elder Brethren, considering
with her self, that in their absence, <hi>Eider</hi> might commit such violences as might prevent her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of the Crown for <hi>Ismael,</hi> thought it not safe openly to oppose the pretensions of the
younger Brother, but suffer'd him to assume the title of King, and he was acknowledg'd as such
all over the Palace. But she had all the Avenues so well Guarded, that it was impossible for
<hi>Eider</hi>'s friends to carry any tidings of it to the City. So that the young Prince coming to distrust
his Sister's carriage, and apprehending it might be their design to sacrifice him to his Brother's
ambition, conceal'd himself among the Women, till such time as <hi>Schamal, a Georgian,</hi> his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
by the Mother-side, found him out, and cut off his head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ismael</hi> 11. coming to the Crown, in the 43. year of his age, and reflecting on his long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
confirm'd, by his procedure, the antient Proverb, which sayes, that the reign of
a Prince who returns from Exile, is ever cruel and bloudy. This man began his, with the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
of all the Kinred and Frinds of <hi>Eider,</hi> and all those who had advis'd his Father to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
him, pursuing those whom he could not get apprehended, even as far as the Frontiers of
<hi>Turkey,</hi> and at his first entrance, discover'd the inclination he had to the <hi>Turkish</hi> Religion, which
he openly profess'd. To find out how the Grandees of the Kingdom were affected towards him,
a report was spread abroad of his death, but he rose up again too soon for those, who had been
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47786:160"/>
so imprudent as to discover their aversion to his Government. For he brought to execution all
such as he conceiv'd any jealousie of, and exercis'd so great cruelty, that, his own Sister think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not her self secure, thought it her best course to prevent her own destruction by attempting
the King's. Certain it is, he dy'd a violent death, on the 24. of <hi>November</hi> 1577. and that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaconcona</hi>
was the Contriver and Instrument of it: but this was done so secretly, that it is yet
not known, how <hi>Persia</hi> came to be rid of this Tyrant.</p>

Chodabende,</hi> his elder Brother, of the danger, whereto he expos'd his Person and the Country,
if he suffered the Crown to come to a strange Family, that, at last, he resolv'd to accept of it,
but upon condition, that, before he were oblig'd to make his entrance into <hi>Caswin,</hi> they should
bring him the head of <hi>Periaconcona,</hi> who had imbru'd her hands in the bloud of two of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and in whose power it was in some respects to dispose of the Kingdom. She prostituted
her self to several of the Grandees about the Court, but particularly to <hi>Emeer Chan,</hi> whom she
had raised into some hopes of enjoying the Crown. As soon as <hi>Chodabende</hi> came to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was in the year <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

among his Predecessors, who had contributed most to the preservation and glory of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Persia.</hi> This is the Testimony given of him by <hi>F. Bizarrus;</hi> but the <hi>Persian</hi> Authors
affirm, on the contrary, that never any Prince manag'd a Scepter with greater negligence and
pusillanimity, in so much that finding himself not fit for the carrying on of any Military design,
he spent all his time within the Palace, in Gaming, and diverting himself with the Ladies. That
he was unfortunate to his Wars, and that the common Enemy tas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of spirit and effeminacy, made incursions into <hi>Persia,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Turks</hi> on one side, and the

belonging to that Crown, and were not dispossess'd of them, as long as <hi>Mahomet Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabende</hi>

five thousand <hi>Persians,</hi> and took three thousand prisoners, whom the <hi>Turkish</hi> General ordered
to have their heads cut off, and having heap'd them up together, he sate down upon

conspir'd the death of <hi>Emir Hemse.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ismael III</note> 
                     <hi>Ismael</hi> got him kill'd, in the eighth moneth of his reign,
by a sort of people disguiz'd in VVomens Cloaths, who being cover'd with Veils, according to
the custom of the Countrey, came to the <hi>Schach</hi>'s Chamber door, and told the Guards, that
they were the VVives of some of the <hi>Chans,</hi> whom the King had sent for, and that they waited
there in obedience to his commands. The Murtherers were no sooner got into the Chamber,
but they fell upon the King and kill'd him. But this death was soon after reveng'd upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver

                     <hi>Abas Myrza,</hi> that is to say, Prince <hi>Abas, Mahomet Chodabende</hi>'s third Son, was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Herat,</hi> and was come thence, with an intention to see <hi>Emir Hemse,</hi> his Brother; but
hearing, in his way, of the Murther committed upon him, and having some reason to fear,
that the Murtherer might be advis'd, to secure himself in the Throne, by a double fratricide,
return'd back into his Government. The year following <hi>Abas Myrsa</hi> being advanc'd as far as

                        </gap>abach,</hi> there happened such frequent differences between the
people belonging to the two Brothers, that they heightned the reciprocal distrust they had one
of another. <hi>Abas Myrsa</hi> had about him a Lord of great quality, named <hi>Murschidculi-Chan,</hi>
who had acquir'd so great reputation by his prudence and courage, that <hi>Chodabende</hi> had
entrusted him with the conduct and education of that young Prince. This <hi>Murschidculi,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Ismael,</hi> who had express'd but too much animosity against his Brother, would never
pardon him, and that his life absolutely depended on that of his Master; and considering withall,
that if he prov'd the occasion of raising that Prince, whom he had Govern'd from his youth, to
the Throne, he would have a great share in the Government, resolv'd to prevent the King,
who was already come into the Province of <hi>Karabach,</hi> purposely to march in person against his
Brother. To effect this, some of the great Lords of the Court, who hoped to get into favour
with <hi>Abas Myrsa,</hi> corrupted one of <hi>Ismael</hi>'s Barbers, named <hi>Chudi,</hi> who, coming to trim
him,<note place="margin">Ismael III <hi>kill'd.</hi>
                     </note> cut his Throat. The Lords, who were present at the execution, and thought it concern'd
them to justifie themselves, kill'd the Barber, cut his body into little bits, and reduc'd it to
ashes. Thus dy'd <hi>Schach Ismael III.</hi> in the eighth moneth of his reign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abas Myrsa</hi> had already so for gain'd the affections of the <hi>Persians,</hi>

                     </note> by his vivacity of
spirit, and the moderation they had observ'd through the whole course of his life, that he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Throne with the general satisfaction of all the people. But the favour of <hi>Murschidculi-Chan,</hi>
who had most contributed to his advancement, continu'd not long: for assuming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47786:160"/>
the same authority over the King, which he had had before, while he was onely <hi>Myrsa</hi>
or Prince, he became troublesome and insupportable, and that in so high a degree, that, one
day, the King, desirous to give his opinion upon an affair of great importance, which had been
propos'd, <hi>Murschidculi-Chan</hi> had the insolence to tell him, before a full Council, that he
was not fit to speak of affairs of that nature, they being such as were above the reach of his age
and understanding. The King dissembled, for the present, his Resentment thereof, but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
that that Authority of <hi>Murschidculi-Chan</hi> would eclipse his own, and expose him to
the contempt of his Subjects, he resolv'd to rid his Governour out of the way. He complain'd
of his Favorite's insolence to three Lords of his Council, named <hi>Mehediculi-Chan, Mahomed
Vstadscahi,</hi> and <hi>Aliculi-Chan,</hi> of whom he thought he might be most confident; but finding
they demurr'd upon the business, and, being not too well assur'd what resolution the King
would take, in a business, which to them was of the greatest consequence of any in the World,
that they endeavour'd to disswade him from it, he told them, it was his will, that <hi>Murschid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi-Chan</hi>
should die by their hands, and that if they made any scruple to do it, he should find
means to be obey'd, as, on the contrary, he should not be backward in requiting their services,
who upon that occasion should implicitly execute his commands. This, extremity forc'd them to
follow the King into his Favourite's Chamber, into which he got ere <hi>Murschidculi-Chan</hi>
was awake; so that the King, having found him lying on his back, with his mouth open, gave
him the first blow over-thwart the mouth. The rest gave him each of them a stab; but <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schidculi-Chan,</hi>
being a very stout man, had the courage to get off his bed, and put himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a posture, as should have given them more fear, than he had receiv'd hurt from them,
and no doubt he had dispatch'd some of his murtherers, had it not been for one of his Grooms,
who coming in at the noise, with a batle-axe in his hand, the King said to him; <hi>I would have
the life of</hi> Murschidculi-Chan, <hi>who is become my Enemy; Go, dispatch him, and I will make thee
a</hi> Chan. The Groom did his work as the king commanded, went streight to his Master and
dispatch'd him.</p>
                  <p>The next day, the king put to death all the relations and friends of <hi>Murschidculi-Chan,</hi> that
so he might be absolutely eas'd of all the disturbances, which their discontents might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him; and conferr'd on the Groom the Dignity of <hi>Chan,</hi> with the Government of <hi>Herat.</hi>
This Execution happened in the year 1585. which was the first of the reign of <hi>Schach Abas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first actions of <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> made a sufficient discovery of his abililities in order to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and that there was no necessity of his being any longer under the Eye and Conduct of
another. All his thoughts were bent upon recovering the great Provinces, which the <hi>Turks</hi> and
<hi>Tartars</hi> had usurp'd from the Crown of <hi>Persia,</hi> and he made an absolute resolution to declare a
War against both those Nations, upon that score. Being one day at <hi>Caswin,</hi> he took a walk
out of the Citie, and ask'd the Lords who follow'd him, whether there could be a nobler Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
than that where they then were. There were some took the freedom to tell him, that it
was iudeed an excellent good Countrey, yet was it not to be compar'd with the Province of
<hi>Fars,</hi> much less with that of <hi>Chorasan,</hi> especially that part of the said Province, which the
<hi>Vsbeques</hi> had taken from <hi>Persia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Engages in a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                     </note> in the time of his Father's reign. Upon this discourse, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
resolv'd upon a War against the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and having rais'd a powerfull Army, he
entred <hi>Chorasan. Abdulla,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Vsbeques,</hi> met him, and, at first, with some advantage
over him, in regard the Plague, which was got into <hi>Schach Abas</hi>'s Army, and the unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
weather kept it from being in action. The two Armies were neer six moneths in sight one
of the other; but at last <hi>Schach Abas</hi> set upon <hi>Abdulla,</hi> and forc'd him to retreat to <hi>Mesched.
Schach Abas</hi> continu'd three years in <hi>Chorasan, Abdulla</hi> being not in a condition to disturb him
in his new Conquest, and when he attempted it, he was so unfortunate, that his Army was
not onely defeated, but also he himself, with <hi>Tilem-Chan,</hi> his Brother, and his three Sons,
who were in the Army, fell into the hands of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> who order'd them all to have their
heads cut off. Afterwards <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> went to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and found it so excellently well situated,
and the Countrey about it so pleasant, that he resolv'd to make it the Metropolis of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
beautifying it, to that end, with many Magnificent Structures, and among others, the
<hi>Allacapi,</hi> or Sanctuary, and the Sumptuous <hi>Mosquey Mehedi,</hi> of which we have given an
accompt already. In which Magnificence the Lords of the Court were desirous to imitate him,
by building many rich and noble Palaces.</p>
                  <p>After these victories,<note place="margin">And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                     </note> he march'd against the <hi>Turks,</hi> and having understood by his Spies, that
the Garrison of <hi>Tabris</hi> thought of nothing less than a War, he got together, with as little
noise as might be, a little Army, with which he went in less than six dayes from <hi>Ispahan</hi> to
<hi>Tabris,</hi> though it be ordinarily eighteen dayes journey for the Camels. Being come to the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of <hi>Scibli,</hi> within four leagues of <hi>Tabris,</hi> where the <hi>Turks</hi> kept a party, rather to receive
the customs upon Commodities, than to hinder the entrance of the <hi>Persians,</hi> he, with some
Officers left the Army, and advanc'd as far as the Turn-Pike. The <hi>Turks</hi> imagining they were
Merchants, the Secretary of the Custom-house address'd himself to <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> and ask'd
him for the duties. <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> told him, that he who carried the Purse was coming behind,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47786:161"/>
and, having caus'd <hi>Dsulfakar-Chan</hi> to come up to him, he bid him give the other some money;
but while the Secretary was telling it, he order'd one to dispatch him, made the Soldiers who
kept the Post to submit, and pass'd over his Army. <hi>Aly Bascha,</hi> Governour of <hi>Tabris,</hi> having
intelligence hereof, got some Troops together, at lest as many as the distraction of his affairs
would permit him to do, and went to meet <hi>Abas,</hi> but there being a great inequality between
the Forces on both sides, he was overcome, and fell into the hands of the <hi>Persians.</hi> In the midst
of the Citie, there was a Citadel, built by <hi>Hassan Padschach,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Vssum Cassan,</hi>
which the <hi>Turks</hi> kept a moneth after, but, at last, it was taken, by intelligence, and afterwards
demolish'd. Thence he went to <hi>Nachtzuan;</hi> but the <hi>Turkish</hi> Garrison quitted the place, upon
the first news they receiv'd of the <hi>Persian</hi> Army's coming towards it, and retreated to <hi>Iruan.
Schach-Abas</hi> ordered also the demolishing of the Citadel of <hi>Nachtzuan,</hi> called <hi>Kischikalaban,</hi>
and went and lay before <hi>Iruan,</hi> which he took after a siege of nine moneths. This Conquest
facilitated his reduction of all the other Cities and Neighbouring Provinces, all which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
save onely the Fortress of <hi>Orumi,</hi> the strong and advantageous situation whereof, being
on the point of a Rock, putting him out of all hope of taking it by storm. He besieg'd it eight
moneths together, but finding that the <hi>Kurdes</hi> did him more mischief than the <hi>Turks</hi> themselves,
though they were a free people, and had no dependence on the <hi>Grand Seignor,</hi> he gain'd the
affections of the chiefest among them by Presents and Promises, putting them in hope of all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
on his side, if they would help him to take in that place, and promis'd them all the
booty they should find there. The <hi>Kurdes,</hi> who live onely by Rapine, were willing to serve
him upon those terms. But <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> having receiv'd that service from them, and taken the
Fort by their means, sent to invite the chiefest among them to come and Dine with him. He
had his Tent made with so many turnings and windings, and had those so done over with Cloaths,
that they who came in saw not such as were but six places before them. He had planted two
Executioners in the way, who dispatch'd his Guests as they came into the Tent; and this course
he took with them, out of an apprehension they might do the <hi>Turks</hi> the same services he had
receiv'd from them. He made <hi>Kahan Chan,</hi> Governour of <hi>Orumi</hi> and the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and marching still on, he became Master of all between the Rivers of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Araxis,</hi>
and reduc'd into his power the Citie of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> after a siege of seven weeks, together with
the whole Province of <hi>Schirun,</hi> which he left under the Command of <hi>Dsulfakar-Chan</hi> his
Brother-in-law, The Inhabitants of <hi>Derbent,</hi> hearing what success <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> had had
against the <hi>Turks,</hi> kill'd their <hi>Turkish</hi> Garrison, and submitted to the King of <hi>Persia.</hi> Then
he entred the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> and reduc'd to obedience those people who fell off from the
King's of <hi>Persia,</hi> in the time of <hi>Schach-Tamas.</hi> He ordered to be made neer <hi>Lankeran,</hi> where
a great Fen in a manner cover'd that whole Province, and made the entrance into it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
a way or Bank of Sand, and setled <hi>Chans</hi> in several places of the Province; to wit, <hi>Bain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durc-Chan,</hi>
at <hi>Astara, Mortusa Kuli-Chan,</hi> at <hi>Kesker, Heider-Chan,</hi> at <hi>Turkabun,</hi> a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir,</hi>
at <hi>Rescht, Adam Sulthan,</hi> in <hi>Mesanderan,</hi> and <hi>Hosslein-Chan,</hi> at <hi>Astarabad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> his intention to sit still with these Conquests, but the quiet he had after
them was so little, that he had hardly the time to have his Soveraignty acknowledg'd. For,
being at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> about a year after this War, intelligence was brought him that the <hi>Turk</hi> was
coming into <hi>Persia,</hi> with an Army of five hundred thousand men; whereupon he got together
all the Forces he could, and appointed them their Rendezvous at <hi>Tabris,</hi> and ordered all the
Inhabitants of the Frontiers, to retire, with their Cattel, into Cities and Wall'd Towns, to
destroy all in the Fields, that the Enemy might make no advantage thereof in order to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence.
The <hi>Turk</hi> having advanc'd, and encamp'd neer <hi>Tabris,</hi> the King of <hi>Persia</hi> caus'd it
to be publish'd through his Army, that such as were willing to serve as Volunteers, should list
themselves apart, and that for every <hi>Turks</hi> head they brought him, he would pay fifty Crowns.
About five thousand <hi>Persians</hi> listed themselves upon that accompt; so that not a day pass'd, but
some heads were brought in, and at his rising every morning, a good number was presented to
him. Nay, one Soldier, named <hi>Bairam Tekel</hi> brought him one morning five together, and by
that means gain'd the favour of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> who rais'd him to the Dignity of <hi>Chan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the end of three moneths <hi>Tzakal Ogli,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army, sent a kind
of Challenge to <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> telling him, that if he had as much confidence in God and the
Justice of his cause, as he would have the VVorld believe, he should not be afraid of accepting
a general Engagement, which he thereby profer'd him. <hi>Abas</hi> was content, and having divided
the ground, the Sun and the VVind with his Enemy, gave him battel. It lasted all that day;
and the night following, the <hi>Turks,</hi> who had lost many of their men, retreated. The next
day word was brought to the Camp, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were retreated; but <hi>Abas,</hi> who fear'd
it might be a stratageme of theirs, stood on his Guard for three dayes, keeping the Army upon
continual duty, and not so much as going himself into his Tent during that time; till that the
Scouts having at last brought him word, that the Enemy was effectually retreated towards
the Frontiers, he advanc'd to the Mountain of <hi>Sehend,</hi> where he Encamped, and there it was,
that <hi>Mahumed Chan Kasak, Schaheruch-Chan, Esschar,</hi> and <hi>Iischan, Kurtzibaschi,</hi> were
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47786:161"/>
cut to pieces, for having given the king poyson, who immediately taking an Antidore, receiv'd
no hurt thereby.</p>
                  <p>Two years after this War, the <hi>Turk</hi> made another invasion into <hi>Persia,</hi> with an Army of
three hundred thousand men, and besieged the Fortress of <hi>Iruan,</hi> in the Province of the same
name: but he was forc'd to raise the siege and to retreat. About two years after that, <hi>Murat
Bascha,</hi> General of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army, besieg'd and took <hi>Tabris,</hi> and kept it four moneths,
within which time there happen'd five set battels between those two Nations, with little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the <hi>Persians.</hi> And yet at last <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> defeated the <hi>Turks,</hi> and recover'd the Citie
out of their hands. Being after this expedition, return'd to <hi>Ardebil,</hi> he there caus'd to be
kill'd <hi>Dsulfakar, Chan</hi> of <hi>Scamachie</hi> in the manner we have related before, and put into his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<hi>Iusuf-Chan,</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> by birth, and by condition a Slave, who had a long time
serv'd him as on ordinary Foot-man.</p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Persia</hi> enjoy'd a Peace of twenty years together, at the end whereof the <hi>Turks</hi>
entred it again with a powerfull Army, under the Command of <hi>Chalil Basscha,</hi> with whom
joyned also several parties of the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Crim</hi> and <hi>Precop. Schach-Abas</hi> sent against them
<hi>Kartzschuckai-Chan,</hi> the most Valiant and most Fortunate of all his Captains, who wearied
them out, and forc'd them to retreat, after several Engagements, or Skirmishes rather, wherein
he took Prisoners two <hi>Tartar</hi>-Princes, <hi>Omersbeg,</hi> and <hi>Schahinkerai-Chan,</hi> and the Bashaws of
<hi>Egypt, Aleppo, Erserum,</hi> and <hi>Wan,</hi> The King, instead of treating them ill, presented each of
them with a Garment and an excellent Horse, and sent them back without paying any Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> went into <hi>Georgia,</hi> where he staid nine moneths. During his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad
there, <hi>Tameras-Chan,</hi> the Son of <hi>Simon</hi> had the confidence to enter with an Army into
the Province of <hi>Seggen,</hi> in the midst of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and to give battel to <hi>Schach-Abas;</hi> but he was
forc'd to retreat with great loss. While he was in those parts, he pay'd his Army twelve
Musters together, and hearing that his Soldiers spent most of their money in <hi>Tobacco,</hi> he forbad
the use of it, with such severity, that he caus'd their Noses and Lips to be cut off, who were
found to have taken of it,<note place="margin">An exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> contrary to the Prohibitions: and having understood,
that a Merchant, who knew not that the king had forbidden the use of Tobacco,
and brought several Bags of it into the Army, in hopes to make a greater advantage thereof
among the Soldiers, he order'd him to be set on a heap of Fagots, with all his Tobacco a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, which being set on fire, he, and his Commodity were reduc'd to smoke and
ashes.</p>
                  <p>After this was it that <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> went into <hi>Kilan,</hi> where he put to death his eldest Son, as
we shall relate anon. <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> had three lawfull Wives, and four or five hundred Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines.
By his three Wives he had so many Sons, to wit, <hi>Sefi Myrsa, Chodabende Myrsa,</hi>
and <hi>Imanculi Myrsa.</hi> He ordered the two younger to have their eyes put out with fire, and
confin'd them in the Fortress of <hi>Alamuth,</hi> under a very strict Guard. The eldest Son was born
of a <hi>Christian</hi> Slave, of <hi>Georgia.</hi> This Prince having cast his Eye on a very handsom young
Maid of <hi>Circassia,</hi> whom a Merchant of <hi>Scamachie</hi> had presented to <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> fell in Love
with her, and intreated his Father to permit he should marry her. The king who dearly lov'd
that Prince, by reason of the great complyance he had for him, consented thereto, and ordered
her to be brought up in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> near the Mother of <hi>Sefi Myrsa,</hi> who had by her <hi>Sain Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi>
since king of <hi>Persia,</hi> under the name of <hi>Schach-Sefi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Over-severe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> puts to death his eldest Son.</note> or rather, Cruel, and Tyrannical reign of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> began to grow
so odious and insupportable to the Grandees of the kingdom, that some had the confidence to
cast a Note into <hi>Sefi Myrsa</hi>'s Chamber, whereby they discover'd to him, that if he would
not stand in his own way, he might immediately succeed the king his Father, and that if he
would consent to the Execution of the Design they were engag'd in to that end, they would
soon show him how the business was to be effected. <hi>Sefi</hi> conceiv'd a horrour at the Proposition,
whereby he was to be a complice in his Father's death, and thereupon carried the Note to the
king, accompanying his free and innocent proceeding with so many protestations of the sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his intentions, and an absolute dependence on his Father's will, as might well satisfie any
other mind less distrustfull than that of <hi>Schach-Abas.</hi> He could not forbear expressing outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he was very well satisfy'd with his Son, and commended his affection and piety: but
he afterwards fell into such frights, as depriv'd him of all rest, and oblig'd him to change his
Lodging twice or thrice in a night, with such disturbances, as he conceiv'd he could not be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
of otherwise than by the death of his Son. According to these apprehensions, being one
day at <hi>Rescht</hi> in the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> with the whole Court about him, a Flatterer so
heighten'd the distractions of his mind, by the false Alarm he gave him of a new Conspiracy
of <hi>Sefi Myrsa</hi>'s, with several of the great Lords of the kingdom against him, that he resolv'd he
should dye.</p>
                  <p>He thought, at first to employ, in that Commission <hi>Kartzschuckai-Chan,</hi> General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
or Constable of <hi>Persia,</hi> and would have oblig'd him to kill his Son with his own hands.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:47786:162"/>
This Lord, was Originally descended from an <hi>Armenian</hi> Family, born by Father and Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of <hi>Christians,</hi> and had been stollen away in his youth by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who had Circumcis'd
and sold him to <hi>Schach-Abas.</hi> The freedom and sincerity of his disposition and demeanour,
had gain'd him the friendship of the whole Court, and his courage had so well setled him in the
king's favour, that having, by his means, had several great victories over his Enemies, he had
conferr'd on him the Command of his Army, and look'd upon him with such respect, that he
never call'd him by any other name than that of <hi>Aga,</hi> that is, the Captain.</p>
                  <p>The king would needs put him upon this important service, as considering him to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who of any in his kingdom was the most oblig'd to him for his Fortune. But the grave old
Man, having laid down his Sword at the kings feet, and cast himself by it, told him, that he
was so infinitely oblig'd to his Majesty, that he would rather lose a thousand lives, than that
he should be ever reproach'd to have imbru'd his hands in the blood of any of the royal Progeny,
so far was it against his Soul to commit a Crime of that nature, and by putting to death the
Heir of the Crown, execute a command which the king could not impose upon him without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
and which were no sooner put in Execution, but he would repent him of it. <hi>Schach-Abas</hi>
was satisfy'd with this excuse, from him, and made the same Proposition to a Gentleman, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Bebut-Beg,</hi> whom he found not so scrupulous as <hi>Kartzschuckai-Chan.</hi> This man having
undertaken that Commission went immediately to <hi>Sefi Myrsa,</hi> and having met him coming
out of a Bath, riding on a Mule, and accompany'd only by a single Page, layes hold on the
Bridle, stayes the Mule, and sayes, Alight, <hi>Sefi Myrsa,</hi> it is the pleasure of the king thy Father
that thou should'st die, and thereupon throws him down. The unfortunate Prince, joyning his
hands together, and lifting up his eyes to Heaven, cries out. <hi>O my God! what have I done to
deserve this disgrace? Cursed be the Traytor who is the occasion thereof. But since it is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God thus to dispose of me, Gods will and the King's be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had hardly the time to speak out those words, ere <hi>Bebut</hi> gave him two stabs with a
<hi>Chentze,</hi> which is a kind of Ponyard, ordinarily worn by the <hi>Persians</hi> in their Girdles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he laid him dead upon the place. The body was dragg'd into a Fen not far thence, where
it continu'd above four hours. In the mean time, the news of this Murther being brought into
the City, the people ran in multitudes to the Palace, threatned to force the Gates, and would
have the Authors thereof deliver'd up to them, in so much that the <hi>Chans,</hi> who were afraid,
that in the fury of their first insurrection, the people would wreak their malice indifferently on
all they met, forsook the king, and got away. The Queen, <hi>Sefi Myrsa</hi>'s Mother, understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that her Son had been kill'd by the king's express order, was so overcome with grief, that
not minding the humour of the Prince she had then to do withall, who could not endure the lest
opposition, she ran into the king's Apartment, and not thinking it enough to reproach him
with his inhumanity, and the barbarous death of an innocent Prince, and one whom he had
tenderly lov'd, she flew in his face, and beat him with her first. But the king, instead of being
angry with her, was at an absolute loss, and at last made her answer with tears in his eyes;
<hi>What would you have had me to do? News was brought me that he had a design upon my life. There
is now no remedy, what's done cannot be recall'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other side, <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> had no sooner heard of this execution, but it repented him
of having commanded it, and express'd no small regret, that he had proceeded with so much
precipitation in a business of that importance. He thought it not enough to acknowledge it
done by his order, but would needs continue ten dayes shut up in a place where he would not see
the light of the Sun, as having all that time a Handkercher over his eyes. He liv'd a whole
moneth, and eat no more than what was purely necessary to keep him from starving. He went
in mourning a whole year, and all his life after he wore not any thing about him, that might,
as to matter of Cloaths, distinguish him from the meanest of his Subjects. And in some fort, to
eternize the memory of the Prince, he caus'd the place where he was kill'd, to be encompass'd
with a high Wall, made a Sanctuary of it, and allow'd it a certain Revenue, for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a great number of poor people. The first ten dayes of his greatest mourning being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
he went from <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>scht</hi> to <hi>Caswin,</hi> where he would needs entertain the <hi>Chans,</hi> whom he any
way suspected, and the Flatterer, who had made him jealous of the Prince, at a Dinner, but he
caus'd poyson to be mixt in their Wine, and kept them so long at Table till he saw them all
dead in the place.</p>
                  <p>The action of <hi>Bebut-beg</hi> was indeed recompens'd with the charge of <hi>Daruga,</hi> of <hi>Caswin,</hi> and
some time after with that of <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Kesker;</hi> but he could not avoid the punishment which so
base a complyance too well deserv'd. For the first journey the king made to <hi>Caswin,</hi> after that
we spoke of before, he commanded <hi>Bebut,</hi> to go and cut off, with his own hands, his Son's
head, and to bring it him. He was forc'd to obey, and <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> seeing him coming into
the Room with his Son's head, ask'd him how he did. <hi>Bebut</hi> made answer, Alass my Liege, I
think I need not tell you; I have been forc'd with my own hands to kill my only Son, whom
I lov'd above any thing in the World; the grief I shall conceive thereat will bring me to my
Grave. The king reply'd, <hi>Go thy wayes,</hi> Bebut, <hi>and consider how great must have been my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47786:162"/>
when thou broughtst the news of my Son's death, whom I had commanded thee to put to
death. But comfort thy self, my Son and thine are no more, and reflect, that thou art in this equal
to the King thy master.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after this unhappy Paricide,<note place="margin">Assassinate punish'd.</note> 
                     <hi>Bebut</hi> ended his life after an extraordinary manner.
For, soon after he had taken possession of the Government of <hi>Kesker,</hi> one of his servants,
giving him water to wash after Dinner, according to the <hi>Persian</hi> custom, pour'd it on so hot
that it scalded his hands, which incens'd him so that he threatned to have him cut to pieces; but
the Slave prevented him, and considering that he who had been so barbarous as to murther his
Prince and his own Son, would make no great difficulty to rid the World of a servant, he
conspir'd with some of his Gamerades, who expected no better treatment from their Master,
and kill'd him the night following in his drink. <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> was not much troubled, that that
hatefull object was remov'd out of his sight, and would not have prosecuted the Murtherers,
had not the other <hi>Chans</hi> represented to him, that, if they were not made examples, no Lord
could think himself secure among his servants, after he had given them some theatning
language.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Schach-Abas</hi>'s affliction, and the regret he express'd for his Son's death, how great
soever they might be, took not off the just apprehensions the Widdow conceiv'd, that he had
a design to put to death his Grand-Child <hi>Sain Myrsa.</hi> Whence it came, that she kept him a
long time conceal'd, and would not suffer him to be brought to Court, though the King, who
saw his two younger Sons, whose eyes he had caus'd to be put out, were excluded the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by the Laws of the Kingdom, design'd that little Prince to succeed him. 'Tis repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
he had a great tenderness for him, and yet lest he should appear to soon, and the vivacity
of his spirit revive the affection which the people had express'd towards his Father, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to have his senses dull'd, and commanded there should be given him every day about the
begness of a Pea of <hi>Opium,</hi> the use whereof is very common in <hi>Persia,</hi> as we have said elsewhere;
but that the Mother, instead of giving him that Drug, made him often take Treacle, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other preservatives against the poyson, which she conceiv'd she had some cause to suspect
might be given him.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Schach. Abas</hi> was in <hi>Kilan, Tamaras-Chan,</hi> taking advantage of his absence, entred
again with an Army into <hi>Georgia,</hi> and recover'd all those places, out of which he had been
forc'd. The King sent thither <hi>Aliculi-Ghan; Mahumed-Chan, Kasack,</hi> and <hi>Mortusaculi,
Chan</hi> of <hi>Talisch,</hi> and several other <hi>Chans,</hi> who could do no good there, but brought word
back, that they had found the Enemy so advantageously posted, that they durst not set upon
him. The King punish'd their seeming prudence with death, and went the next year in person
into <hi>Georgia,</hi> protesting at his departure, that if he return'd victorious from that VVar, he
would sell the <hi>Georgians,</hi> at an <hi>Abas,</hi> or fifteen pence a head. Upon which occasion they say
it hapned, that the King being Master of the Field, and having taken a great number of Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
a Souldier came to him, with two <hi>Abases</hi> in his hand, and desir'd him to sell him two
handsom young Maids, who were among the Prisoners, and that the King remembring his
Oath, permitted him to take his choice. It was about this time, that most of the <hi>Georgian
Christians,</hi> who liv'd at <hi>Ispahan</hi> at the time of our being there, came out of their Country to
settle themselves in the Metropolis of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Much also about the same time, was it, that <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> receiv'd Letters from <hi>Bekirkcha,</hi> who,
under the Grand-Seignor, commanded the Garrison of <hi>Bagdat</hi> or <hi>Babylon.</hi> This man,
dissatisfy'd with the Court, upon his being deny'd the Government of that place, at the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s
death, under whom he had had the Lieutenancy, proffer'd <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> to deliver up the City
to him. The King hearkned to that Proposition, and immediately took his march with a good
Army towards those parts; but ere he got thither, <hi>Bikirkeha</hi>'s discontent was over, so far that
he sent <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> word, that he had only Powder and Bullets at his service. He was so net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at the affront, that he protested not to return thence till he had taken the City, though it
should cost him his life. Accordingly, having pass'd over the Ditch, after a siege of six months,
and having set fire to a Mine, which work the <hi>Persians</hi> are very excellent at, he caus'd an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
to be given, entred the breach, and became Master of the City, without any composition.
<hi>Bikirkeha</hi> being found among the Prisoners, was sown up in a raw Ox-Hide. and in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
plac'd near the High-way, where the King order'd him to be sed, till such time as the heat
of the Sun having made the Hide shrink together, he died a very painful death. His Son cast
himself at <hi>Schach-Abas</hi>'s feet, and satisfy'd him so far of his being wholly unconcern'd in his
Father's proceeding, that having begg'd his Pardon, he by that submission obtain'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Schiras,</hi> which <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> made no difficulty to bestow on him; in regard that
lying at a great distance from the Frontiers of <hi>Turkey,</hi> he fear'd not his proving unfaithful to
him.</p>
                  <p>The year following, the Emperour of the <hi>Turks</hi> caus'd <hi>Bagdat</hi> to be besieg'd, by the <hi>Bassa,
Hasis Ahmed;</hi> but <hi>Abas</hi> forc'd him to raise the siege, and continu'd eight moneths together in
sight of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army, till such time as sickness having consum'd a great number of the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47786:163"/>
                     <hi>Turks,</hi> who were not so well able to endure the great heats, as the <hi>Persians, Hasis</hi> was oblig'd
to retreat to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> At his return from this expedition, <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> began to build
the Citie of <hi>Ferabath,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Mesandran,</hi> upon occasion of a Village, named <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hona,</hi>
situated upon a pleasant River, which, not far thence, falls into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea.</p>
                  <p>This Victory procur'd him but two years rest. For the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour, desirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<hi>Bagdat,</hi> sent <hi>Chalil Bassa,</hi> with an Army of five hundred thousand men, to reduce it.
<hi>Schach-Abas</hi> commanded <hi>Cartzschugai-Chan</hi> to march to the relief of the Citie, with a small
Brigade, but consisting of choice men, and he follow'd him in person, with the whole Army.
He himself got into the Citie, and sent <hi>Kartzschugai-Chan</hi> to meet the <hi>Turk,</hi> whom he wearied
out with perpetual skirmishes for six moneths together. At last he gave him battel, disorder'd,
and defeated him, forcing him to fly as far as <hi>Netzed.</hi> Upon the first news of the Victory,
<hi>Schach-Abas</hi> left the Citie, to go and meet <hi>Kartzschugai-Chan,</hi> and being come neer him
alighted, and said to him; <q>My dearest <hi>Aga,</hi> I have by thy means and conduct obtain'd so
noble a Victory, that I would not have desir'd a greater of God, come, get up on my Horse,
'tis fit I should be thy Lackey.</q> 
                     <hi>Kartzschugai</hi> was so surpriz'd at this discourse, that he cast
himself at his feet, intreated his Majesty to look on him as his slave, and not to expose him to
the derision of all the World, by doing him an honour so extraordinary, as that it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
he could any way deserve it. But notwithstanding all his intreaties, he was forc'd to get
up, the King and the <hi>Chans</hi> following on foot, onely seven paces. <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> had many
other Wars against the <hi>Turks;</hi> but the most signal Victory he ever got over his Enemies, was
at the reduction of the Citie of <hi>Ormus,</hi> which he recover'd from the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> six years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death. Of that an account shall be given in the subsequent Travels of <hi>Mandelslo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the end of the year 1629. he took a journey to <hi>Ferabath,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanderan,</hi>
which was the place he most delighted in of any in his Kingdom; but he there fell so
ill, that, perceiving he should not escape, he sent for four Lords of the chiefest of his Councel,
to wit, <hi>Isa-Chan, Kurtzibaschi, Seiul-Chan, Tuschmal,</hi> or Councellor of State, <hi>Temerbey,
Ouwogly,</hi> or Lord High-Steward, and <hi>Iusuf Aga,</hi> chief Gentleman of his Chamber, who
being come to his Bed-side, he told them. That, firmly believing the sickness he was then in
would be his last, it was his pleasure, that his Grand-Child, <hi>Sain Myrsa,</hi> should succeed
him, and assume his Father's name, obliging them all solemnly to promise him, that, after
his death, they would religiously execute his Last Will. The Astrologers had told <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi>
that <hi>Sain</hi> should reign but eight moneths at most; but when these Lords would have
spoke to him of that Prediction, the King made answer, <hi>Let him reign as long as he can, though
it were but three dayes; it will be some satisfaction to me, to be assur'd, that he shall one day have
on his head the Crown which was due to the Prince his Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twas conceiv'd, he had had some poyson given him, upon which presumption the <hi>Hakim
Iusuf,</hi> his Physician, order'd him hot bathing for eight dayes together, and for four dayes
afterward another kind of Bath, of Cows milk: but all these remedies being either ineffectual,
or too weak, he seriously prepar'd himself for death, even to the appointing of the place where
he would be interr'd. But that the people might not certainly know it, he commanded the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of his Funeral should be Celebrated in three several places, at the same time, to wit,
at <hi>Ardebil, Mesched,</hi> and <hi>Babylon;</hi> but the more general report is, that the body was carried
to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and thence to the <hi>Netzef,</hi> of <hi>Kufa,</hi> neer the Sepulchre of <hi>Aly,</hi> upon this accompt,
that <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> going to <hi>Kufa,</hi> soon after the reduction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and looking on the
<hi>Netzef,</hi> said, he had never seen a more delightfull place, and that he should wish to be there
interr'd after his death. What ere became of his body, certain it is that he dy'd, in the year
1629. having liv'd 63. years, and reign'd 45. He discover'd the strength of his memory and
understanding, in the order he took, at his death, that it might be kept secret, till his Grand-Child
were assur'd of the Succession; commanding that they should expose his body every day
in the same Hall, where he was wont to administer Justice, set in a Chair of State, with his
eyes open, his back turn'd to the Hangings, behind which stood <hi>Iusuf Aga,</hi> who ever and anon
made him lift up his Arm, by means of a silk string, and answer'd those things which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by <hi>Temir-beg,</hi> on the behalf of such as were at the other end of the Hall, and who were
thereby perswaded that <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> was still alive. This was so well personated, that his death
was conceal'd, for the space of six weeks.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> have a Veneration for the memory of this Prince,<note place="margin">The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the memory, of <hi>Schach-Abas.</hi>
                     </note> and speak of him as of the
greatest King that <hi>Persia</hi> hath had these many ages. And indeed, take but out of his life, the
examples of cruelty we have touch'd at before, it must be acknowledg'd, that, if we may not
number him among the <hi>good,</hi> yet must we assign him a place among the <hi>greatest</hi> Princes, of any
mentioned in the modern Histories. He was Wise and Valiant, and hath heightned the glory of
<hi>Persia</hi> by the great Victories he obtain'd over his Enemies, extending by that means the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of his Kingdom of all sides, towards the <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Tartars.</hi> The <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
Friers told us, that, he was so far from having any aversion for <hi>Christian</hi> Religion,
that, on the contrary, he often came to their Monastery, made them Dine with him, sent for
<pb facs="tcp:47786:163"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:47786:164"/>

them in the night, put their Beads about his Neck, sighing, and saying, that he knew not
which Religion he should embrace, and discoursing very familiarly with them. He had a great
sence of the miseries of the Poor, and took a particular care for their subsistence. Whence it
came that it was ordinary with him, after his departure out of some Citie to return into it again
<hi>incognito,</hi> to go to the Market, and to examine their weights, and the goodness of their Bread
and other Provisions, severely punishing such as he found guilty of any Circumvention. Being
one day at <hi>Ardebil,</hi> he ordered to be put into a red hot Oven, a certain rich Baker, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to sell Bread to the Poor, under pretence that he was oblig'd to keep it for <hi>Abas,</hi> and
his Soldiers, who, as he said, could never be satisfy'd; and he caus'd to be fasten'd, by the
back, to the hooks on which the Mear had hung, a Butcher, whose weights had been found
too light. He took a pleasure in bestowing, in Alms, the money he got from publick places,
as being perswaded they could not be acceptable to God, if that sacrifice were made of that
money which is taken from the people. He could not endure those Judges who receiv'd money
on either side, and severely punish'd such as were guilty of Concussions, and manifest injustice.
For, coming to understand that a <hi>Kasi,</hi> or Judge of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> after he had taken Presents from
both sides, to wit, some 70. l. <hi>sterl.</hi> from each, would have perswaded them to come to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
he ordered him to be set on an Ass, with his face towards the tayl, which serv'd
him for a Bridle, and upon his Judge's Robe caus'd to be put the Entrails of a Sheep newly
kill'd, cut in several places, and in that posture he made him take several turns about the <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi>
having it cry'd before him, that this should be the punishment of a corrupt Judge.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Temir-beg,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

as we said before <hi>Seinel-Chan</hi> made all the haste he could to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> whither he brought the
news of the King's death to the <hi>Daruga, Chofrou Myrsa,</hi> and having consulted with him about
the means they should use to advance <hi>Sain Myrsa</hi> to the Throne, they went together to the
Appartment of the Princess, his Mother, which is called <hi>Taberick-kale,</hi> and intreated her to
put the young Prince into their hands. The Mother, who still had before her eyes the violent
death of her Husband, believing it was some fiction, and that they had order from <hi>Schach-Abas</hi>
to Murther the Prince, lock'd her self up in her Chamber, and made all passages so fast, that
these two Lords being out of all hopes to perswade her, and being afraid to let slip the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of executing the deceas'd Kings last Will, after they had lain three dayes at the Princesse's
Chamber door, sent her word, that if she would not open, they should be forc'd to break it.
Upon this message she at last opened the door, and presented to them the Prince her Son; but,
conceiving it was in order to his present execution, with these words; <hi>Go child to the same place
where thy Father is, here are the murtherers ready to dispatch thee.</hi> But when she saw those Lords
prostrate themselves, and kissing the Prince's feet, her fright was turn'd into perfect joy. The
Lords conducted the Prince to the Palace-Royal, where they set him in the <hi>Divan-Chane,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Table of stone, on which were as many Carpets, (which they call (<hi>Kalitse Ahdalet,</hi> or
Carpets of Justice) as there had been Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> of his Family, (in as much as every King,
at his first coming to the Crown, causes one to be made for him) and having sent for all the
<hi>Chans</hi> and Lords who were about <hi>Ispahan,</hi> they Crown'd him, kiss'd his feet, and wishing him
a long and happy Reign, setled him in the Throne of his Ancestors.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after the Ceremonies of his Coronation, he took the name of <hi>Sefi,</hi> according
to the desire of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> and bestow'd on the <hi>Chosrou Myrsa</hi> the Dignity of <hi>Chan,</hi> with
the name of <hi>Rustam,</hi> as desirous, by that means, to revive, in his person, the memory of the
great <hi>Heroe,</hi> so highly Celebrated in their Histories and Romances.</p>
                  <p>It is reported that <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi> came into the World with his hands all bloody,<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his reign cruel,</note> and that
<hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> his Grand-Father, hearing of it, said, that that Prince should often bath his
hands in blood. Accordingly, till the time of our Embassy, his reign had been so cruel and
bloody, that <hi>Persia</hi> had not, for many ages before, seen so many executions. For immediately
upon his coming to the Crown, he follow'd the counsel of the Chancellor, Predecessor to him
whom we knew, and made away <hi>Rustan-Chan,</hi> whom he had made Generalissimo of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of <hi>Persia,</hi> and Governour of <hi>Tiflis,</hi> and several other Lords, and caus'd to be cut in pieces,
or kill'd with his own hands, all his own relations, and what other persons soever he was any
way distrustfull of, by that means so accustoming himself to blood, that, when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd,
he spar'd none, and kill'd or order'd to be kill'd, upon trivial occasions, such as he
was any way displeas'd with. I shall here produce a few examples thereof, that the Reader may,
by them, as a Pattern, judge of the rest of his life.</p>
                  <p>He began his cruelties, by an onely Brother, though born of a Concubine, whose eyes he
caus'd to be put out. <hi>Chodabende,</hi> and <hi>Imanculi Myrsa</hi> his Uncles, younger brethren to <hi>Sefi
Myrsa,</hi> whom <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> their Father, had confin'd in the Castle of <hi>Alamuth,</hi> thirty
Leagues from <hi>Caswin,</hi> after he had put out their eyes as we said before, were cast down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
from a high Rock, for this reason, as <hi>Sefi</hi> said, that, having lost the benefit of their sight,
they were useless in the World. Afterwards he dispatch'd <hi>Isa-Chan,</hi> his Uncle, after he had
cut off the heads of his three Sons, upon the following occasion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:47786:165"/>
                     <hi>Isa-Chan</hi> was so much in favour with <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> that the King, willing to make it appear
what extraordinary respect he had for him, bestow'd on him his Daughter, by whom he had the
three Sons,<note place="margin">Kills ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vncle and his three Sons.</note> whom <hi>Sefi</hi> put to death. She was a very handsom Woman, and of a pleasant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
insomuch that <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi> her Nephew, was extremely taken with her company.
This Princess, being one day with the king, took the freedom to jeast with him, and to tell
him, she much wondred, that he, who was so young and vigorous, and had so many great
beauties to command, could get no Children, whereas she had had three by her Husband.
The king made answer, that he was young, and having, as he hoped, many years to reign,
there would be time enough to get Heirs to inherit the Crown after him. But the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
desirous to keep on the jeast, reply'd, that, ground not well cultivated would hardly
bring forth any thing, imprudently adding, You speak very well, my Liege, but I fear me,
that after your death the <hi>Persians</hi> will be glad to pitch upon one of my Sons to succeed you.
The king was extremely troubled at the boldness and bitterness of the jeast, but made a shift to
dissemble it, and to get out of the Room, without the Princesse's perceiving that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
against her.</p>
                  <p>The next day, the King commanded the three Sons of <hi>Isa-Chan</hi> to be brought to him; the
eldest was 22. years of age, the second 15. and the third 9. and having convey'd them into a
a Garden, he caus'd their heads to be cut off, and at Dinner time having dispos'd the three heads
into one of those cover'd Pots, in which the <hi>Persians</hi> bring the Rice and Meat to be set on the
Table, and sending for the Mother, he order'd them to be taken out one after another, by the
Nose, and said to the Princess; <hi>See the children of a Woman who bragg'd so much of her fertility;
go, thou art young enough to bear more of them.</hi> The Princess was so astonish'd at that horrid
Spectacle, that she was not able to speak a word; but perceiving in the Kings eyes and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the eruptions of his indignation, which she imagin'd might break forth to her unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
death, she cast her self at his feet, kiss'd them, and said to him, <hi>All is well, all is well;
God grant the King a long and happy life.</hi> This forc'd complyance sav'd her life. But as soon as
she had left the Room, <hi>Sefi</hi> sent for <hi>Isa-Chan,</hi> and pointing with his finger to the heads of his
Children, ask'd him what he thought of that pleasant Spectacle. <hi>Isa-Chan,</hi> who knew what
humour the Prince was of, and whom he had to do withall, smother'd the tenderness of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
affection, and made answer, that he was so far from being displeas'd thereat, that if the
King had commanded him, to bring the heads of his Sons, he would have been the Executioner
himself, and that he would have no Children, if the Kings pleasure were it should be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
This base and bruitish flattery sav'd <hi>Isa-Chan</hi>'s life at that time; but the King reflecting,
that he could not be faithfull to him, at lest that it was impossible he should love him, after he
had been so treated by him, gave order his head should be also cut off.</p>
                  <p>We said before,<note place="margin">Kills <hi>Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel-Chan</hi> with his own hands.</note> that <hi>Isa-Chan</hi> was one of those who had most contributed to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi> to the Throne of his Predecessors. <hi>Seinel-Chan</hi> had also done much in that
business; whence it came he was not to expect any better treatment than the other, from him
whom he had rais'd to a condition to commit so many inhumane actions. <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi> having
forc'd the <hi>Turks,</hi> to raise the siege they had lay'd before <hi>Bagdat</hi> in the year 1632. encamp'd
with his Army near <hi>Hemedan,</hi> at which place, several Lords, reflecting on the executions
wherewith the King had signaliz'd the beginning of his reign, said among themselves, that since
in his tender age, he could commit so many cruelties, it was likely he would in time, extirpate
all the Grandees of <hi>Persia. Seinel-Chan,</hi> who was present at this discourse, went immediately
to the King, and gave him an account of what had past in that conference, advising him to rid
himself of those who had most credit among them, and so secure his own life. The King made
him answer; <hi>Thy advice,</hi> Seinel-Chan, <hi>is so good, that I will immediately follow it; and I will
begin with thee; for thou art the person of greatest age and most authority among them, and must
needs be of the conspiracy. And I shall in that follow the example of the King, my Grand-Father,
whose reign was neither safe nor happy, till he had executed him, who had the same charge of</hi> Kurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zibachi,
<hi>which thou now enjoyest. Seinel-Chan</hi> reply'd, that that would be no hard matter for
him to do; that, for his part, he was arriv'd to the greatest age man could attain, and that it
would not trouble him much, his life should be shortned some few dayes: but that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
would haply one day be troubled, that he had put to death one of his most faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and that he should rather consider the importance of the discovery he had made to him,
and the earnestness he had therein express'd to serve him. This answer delay'd the execution of
what the king had resolv'd to do; so that he thereupon went to his Mother, who had follow'd
him in his expedition, with the other Ladies of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> according to the antient custom
of <hi>Persia,</hi> to acquaint her with what he had heard. The next morning the Princess sent for
<hi>Seinel-Chan</hi> to her Tent door, to hear from him all the circumstances of that Conspiracy, but
as soon as the king heard that <hi>Seinel-Chan</hi> had spoken to his Mother, he was so incens'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
that he went and kill'd him with his own hands, in the presence of the Princess.</p>
                  <p>This certainly was one of the greatest persons in the kingdom, who ought his fortune to his
conduct, and the trust wherewith he had serv'd <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> in several affairs of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
whereof we shall here allege only one example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:47786:165"/>
                     <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> being to send a solemn Embassy to <hi>Lahor,</hi> to the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> about the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
there were between them for the Frontiers of <hi>Candahar,</hi> would needs employ in it
<hi>Seinel Chan,</hi> as being the person, whom, of all his Ministers, he repos'd greatest confidence in;
and as he took leave of him in order to his departure, he said to him: <hi>For this employment, I
have made choice of thee,</hi> Seinel, <hi>out of the assurance I have of thy fidelity, whereof I expect the
utmost demonstration in this Embassy. For as this shirt sticks close to my back, so would I have
thee to be so tenderly concern'd in my interests, that thou do no thing in this charge that may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
either to my reputation or my service. Seinel-Chan</hi> promis'd him his utmost care, and
was as good as his word. For being come to the <hi>Moguls</hi> Court, he refus'd doing him reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
according to the custom of the Countrey, by putting both hands first to the ground,
and afterwards upon his head, but he entred the Room with a grave and setled gate, and only
saluted the king with his <hi>Salomalek.</hi> The <hi>Indian</hi> Prince was so troubled at it, that he sent to
intreat him to demean himself otherwise, and to render him the same respects, as the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
of <hi>Persia</hi> were wont to approach him withall. Nay, he would have prevail'd with him
to do it, by the proffers he caus'd to be made him of several considerable Presents; but perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that nothing would work with him, he bethougth him, to make, opposite to his Throne,
a Door so low, that <hi>Seinel-Chan</hi> could not come in at without stooping, and consequently not
avoid doing him reverence. But <hi>Seinel-Chan</hi> found means to elude that Artifice, and entred the
king's Chamber backwards, so that the first part that came within the Door was his britch.
This irreverence put the <hi>Mogul</hi> out of all patience; so that, he not only forbore making him
those Presents, which are ordinarily made Ambassadors, and in those parts are of no small va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
but also forbad his people to supply him with the ordinary Provisions; which reduc'd
him to such extremities, that he was forc'd to sell his Plate, and what ever there was of Gold
or Silver about the Saddles and Trappings of his Horses, to subsist. The <hi>Mogul</hi> made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
to <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> of this demeanour of <hi>Seinel Chan,</hi> and the king pretended to be troubled
at the little respect he had rendred the <hi>Mogul;</hi> but he made it appear, on the contrary, that
he was well satisfy'd with his behaviour towards that <hi>Industhan</hi> Prince. For not long after he
honour'd him with the Title of <hi>Chan,</hi> and bestow'd on him the Government of <hi>Hemedan, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kisin,
Kulpcjan,</hi> &amp;c. to be enjoy'd by him during his life, but upon condition, he should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
about the Court, as having one of the chiefest places in the Councel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seinel-Chan</hi> being thus kill'd, the Princess, <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi>'s Mother; who conceiv'd a horrour
thereat, represented to him how much he was to blame, for treating in that manner one of his
Grand-Father's most antient servants, one that had done himself so great services at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Crown; and the king seem'd to be somewhat troubled thereat. But he reflected
not much on those Lectures, since that not many dayes after, the Chancellor, the Lord high
Steward, nay, his own Mother found not better treatment from him; as may be seen in the
following relation.</p>
                  <p>The king being,<note place="margin">Puts to death his Chancellor and others.</note> during the foresaid expedition, encamped in the Mountain of <hi>Sehend,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a League of <hi>Tauris,</hi> and the Lord High Steward, named <hi>Vgurlu-Chan,</hi> being one day to
command the Guard about the king, at which the <hi>Chans</hi> are oblig'd to be personally present,
when the king is in the field, it was his misfortune to go and Sup with <hi>Tabub-Chan,</hi> Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
of the kingdom, who had also invited the <hi>Dawatter,</hi> that is, the Secretary of the Closet,
whose name was <hi>Hassan-beg,</hi> and a certain Poet. Supper being near ended, the <hi>Kischitzi-bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi>
that is, the Captain of the Guard, named <hi>Mortusaculi-Chan,</hi> came to give <hi>Vgurlu-Chan</hi>
notice, that it was time to come to the king's Tent. But the Chancellor, unwilling to dismiss
his Guests, sent away the <hi>Kischitzi-baschi,</hi> and told him that there was no great necessity of
<hi>Vgurla-Chan</hi>'s being there in person, and that the king, being but a Child, would take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of <hi>Vgurla</hi>'s absence, and so he might set the Guard well enough without him.</p>
                  <p>The Captain reiterated his instances for his coming away, and press'd the high Steward to
come and do his duty, and told him, that otherwise he should be oblig'd to make his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
thereof to the king. The Chancellor, importun'd with this discourse, commanded his
people to thrust <hi>Mortusaculi-Chan</hi> out of Doors; which they did, but so roughly, that he was
hurt in the face. He went, all bloody as he was, to the king, and gave him an account of what
had pass'd at the Chancellor's. The king commanded him to say nothing of it: but the next
day, the Chancellor being at Dinner with the king, and sitting in his ordinary place, the king
having commanded him to come near, said to him; What does he deserve, who, eating the
bread, and living by the pure favour of his Master, is so far from paying the respect due to him,
that he slights him? The Chancellor made him answer, he deserves death. Whereto the king
reply'd, Thou hast pronounced thy own sentence; Thou art the person, who living only by
my favour, and eating at my Table, hast had the insolence to treat me as a Child, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
that pass'd yesterday, between thee and <hi>Mortusaculi-Chan.</hi> The Chancellor would
have justify'd himself; but the king not giving him the time to do it, run him into the belly
with his Cymitar. The Chancellor, as he fell down, only cry'd out, <hi>Ha Padschach-Aimahn,</hi>
and the king commanded his <hi>Rika,</hi> who are a part of his Guard who carry Pole-Axes, and many
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47786:166"/>
times do the work of Executioners, to cut his head into little bits. There happened to be one
of the Pages, who conceiving a horror at that cruelty, turn'd aside, and would not look on it,
which the king observing, laid to him; since thy sight is so tender, it will be of no great use to
thee, and commanded his eyes to be immediately put out.</p>
                  <p>The Execution of <hi>Tabub-Chan</hi> was soon follow'd by that of <hi>Vgurlu-Chan,</hi> who receiv'd his
by the king's command, from the hands of <hi>Aliculi-Chan, Divanbeg,</hi> or President of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
who was sent to bring him his head. <hi>Vgurlu</hi> was coming out of the Bath, and going to
put on his Cloaths when <hi>Aliculi-Chan</hi> came to him. <hi>Vgurlu</hi> seeing him coming in, attended
by two servants, was a little startled at it, though they were very good friends, and said to
him, Wo is me! dear friend, I fear thou bringst me no good news. <hi>Aliculi-Chan</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
Thou art in the right, my dear Brother, the king hath commanded me to bring him thy
head, the only way is to submit; whereupon he clos'd with him, cut off his head, made a
hole in one of the cheeks, thrust his finger through it, and so carry'd it to the king, who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on it, touch'd it with a little Wand, and said; <hi>It must be confess'd thou wert a stout man,
it troubles me to see thee in that condition, but it was thine own fault; `tis pitty, were it
only for that goodly beard of thine.</hi> This he said, by reason his Mustachoes were so long, that,
coming about his neck, they met again at his mouth, which is accounted a great Ornament in
<hi>Persia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mortusaculi</hi> had his charge conferr'd on him. <hi>Hassan-beg,</hi> who had also been at the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's
Feast, receiv'd the same treatment; and the Poet, who was afterwards fasly accus'd
of having put this Execution in Verse, and sung them in the <hi>Maidan,</hi> was conducted to that
place, where they cut off his Nose, Ears, Tongue, Feet, and Hands, whereof he died some few
dayes after.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this Execution, the king sent for the Sons of these Lords, and said to them;
You see, I have destroy'd your Fathers, what say you of it? <hi>Vgurlu-Chan</hi>'s Son said very reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
what do's a Father signifie to me? I have no other than the king. This unnatural an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
restor'd him to the Estate of the deceas'd, which otherwise would have been Confiscated
to the king: but the Chancellor's Son was reduc'd to great misery, and had not any thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him of all his Father had enjoy'd, for his expressing a greater Resentment of his death,
than Complyance for the king.</p>
                  <p>The king, being come to <hi>Caswin,</hi> issued out his commands, that all the Lords and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of Provinces should come to Court. They all obey'd this order, save only <hi>Alymerdan-Chan,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Candahar,</hi> and <hi>Daub-Chan,</hi> Governour of <hi>Kentze,</hi> who thought it enough
to assure the king of their fidelity, by sending him, each of them, one of their Wives, and one
of their Children, as Hostages; but the king thought not that submission sufficient; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Alymerdan-Chan</hi> absolutely revolted, and put his person and the Fortress of <hi>Candahar</hi> under
the Protection of the king of the <hi>Indies. Daub-Chan,</hi> understanding by the <hi>Achta,</hi> or Groom
of the king's Chamber, who had been sent to him, how dangerous it were for him to come to
Court, took the advice of his friends, and resolv'd to retire into <hi>Turkey.</hi> To effect his design,
he thought good to try how his servants stood affected towards him, and having found there
were fifteen among them who were unwilling to follow him, he caus'd them to be cut to pieces
in his presence, writ a very sharp Letter to the king, and carried away all his Wealth along with
him, to <hi>Tamaras-Chan,</hi> a Prince of <hi>Georgia,</hi> his Brother-in-law, and went thence into <hi>Turkey,</hi>
where he still liv'd at the time of our Embassy, and was much respected by <hi>Sulthan Ibrahim,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The king, to be reveng'd of both, sent their Wives to the houses
of publick prostitution, and expos'd the Son of <hi>Daud-Chad</hi> to the brutality of the Grooms
about the Court, and the common Executioners of the City; but <hi>Alymerdan</hi>'s Son, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his beauty, was reserv'd for the king's own use.</p>
                  <p>Sometime afterwards, the king sent orders to <hi>Imanculi-Chan,</hi> Governour of <hi>Schiras,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Daud-Chan,</hi> to come to Court. He had notice sent him of the intention the king had to
put him to death: but he made answer, that he could not be perswaded they would treat him so
ill, after he had done such considerable services to the Crown: but however it might happen, he
would rather lose his life, than be out of favour with his Prince, and become a Criminal by his
disobedience.</p>
                  <p>According to this imprudent resolution, he came to <hi>Caswin,</hi> where the Court then was;
but he was no sooner come, ere the king ordered his head to be taken off. <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi> intended
to save the lives of <hi>Imanculi</hi>'s Children, and, no doubt had done it, had it not been for the ill
Office which was rendred them by a wicked Parasite, who, seeing the eldest Son of them at
the king's feet, aged about 18. years, his friends it seems having advis'd him to make
that submission, told his Majesty, that he was not the Son of <hi>Imanculi,</hi> but of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi>
who had bestow'd one of his Concucines in marriage on the Father, being before hand with
Child by him.</p>
                  <p>That word occasion'd the death of that young Lord, and fourteen of his Brethren, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conducted to the <hi>Maidan,</hi> were all beheaded near their Father's body. The Mother made a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47786:166"/>
shift to get away, with the sixteenth, into <hi>Arabia,</hi> to her own Father's, who was a Prince
of those parts, and as we were told. he was living at that time, and had his Habitation at
<hi>Helbise,</hi> three dayes journey from <hi>Besre,</hi> or <hi>Balsara.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The bodies of these executed persons remain'd three dayes in the <hi>Maidan</hi> in the open air, till
that the King, fearing the lamentations, which the Mother of <hi>Imanculi</hi> made there day and
night, would have rais'd the people into an insurrection, commanded them to be taken away.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> do still bemoan the death of this <hi>Imanculi-Chan,</hi> out of a remembrance of his
liberality. He was the Son of <hi>Alla-Werdi-Chan,</hi> who, upon his own charge, built the Bridge
of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and who was as much look'd on as any Lord in <hi>Persia,</hi> for the noble actions he had
done in the Wars.</p>
                  <p>The King's cruelty was as great towards the Ladies, as his inhumanity towards the men. For,
about that time he kill'd one with his own hands, and committed several other murthers. When
he intended any Execution, he was ordinarily clad in Skarlet, or some red stuff, so that all
trembled when he put on any thing of that colour. These unheard of cruelties frightned all that
came neer him, and put some upon a resolution to shorten his dayes by poyson: but that which
they gave him prov'd not strong enough, so that he escap'd the effects of it with a sickness of
two moneths. As soon as he was recover'd, he caus'd and exact enquiry to be made, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it was discover'd, by means of a Woman belonging to the Seraglio, who had been ill-treated
by her Mistress, that the poyson had been prepar'd in the appartment of the Women,
and that his Aunt, <hi>Isa-Chan</hi>'s Wife, had caus'd it to be given him. He reveng'd himself suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
the night following: for the Seraglio was full of dreadfull cries and lamentations, and
it was found the next day, that he had caus'd a great Pit to be made in the Garden, wherein he
had buried forty Women alive, whereof some were Ladies of the Seraglio, others their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and such as attended on them. It was also much about the same time, that a rumour
was spread abroad, that his Mother dy'd of the Plague; but it is more likely the accompany'd
the forty Ladies, who had been buried alive, as we said before.</p>
                  <p>He express'd, when occasion requir'd, courage enough, and it is certain the beginning of
his reign was remarkable for the great Victories he gain'd over his Enemies.<note place="margin">He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

be due to the Valour and Conduct of his Generals, and to fortune rather than his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
for he discover'd not much in any of his actions, which were for the most part teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious,
and without any dependence one of another. To prove this, we need onely instance
the reduction of <hi>Eruan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King, finding that, after a siege of four moneths, his affairs were little advanc'd, fell
into that impatience and despair, that he would go in person upon the assault of the place,
saying, he would rather dye in the in the attempt, than with infamy rise from a place, which
the <hi>Turks</hi> had heretofore taken in three dayes. He had already put on the Cloaths of one of his
Foot-men, that he might not be distinguish'd from others, and had given order for the storming
of the Place, when the Lords, who durst not contradict him, intreated the Princess, his
Mother, to represent to him, how impossible it was to take a place before there was a breach
made, and that the danger whereto he would expose himself, would have no other effect, than
his own death and ignominy, with the destruction of the whole Army. All the answer she
could get to these representations, was, a good box o'th'ear, the King being still bent upon
his former resolution of assaulting the Place, and to that purpose he had taken a Pole-Ax in his
hand to lead them on. But the principal Lords cast themselves at his feet, and intreated him to
grant them but one day more, wherein they promis'd to do all that lay in the power of men
against the Place. They obtain'd their desire, order'd the Whole Army to fall on, even to the
boys, and carried the Place by storm; but they lost in the action above fifty thousand men.</p>
                  <p>The good success, which till that time had attended his designs, soon chang'd, after the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
of so many great persons as he had put to death: and of this there was a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the loss of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> which the <hi>Persians</hi> were not able to maint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who recover'd it out of their hands, twenty six years after they had taken it from them.</p>
                  <p>The onely good action he did during his whole reign, is, that he sent back to their several
Habitations those poor people whom <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> had taken out of <hi>Eruan, Nachtzuan, Chaletz,</hi>
and <hi>Georgia,</hi> to the number of seven thousand, and had brought to <hi>Ferabath,</hi> where they were
employ'd in great buildings, and liv'd in a miserable slavery: yet were there not above three
hundred that made their advantage of this good deed of his, all the rest having perish'd through
misery, and been starv'd.</p>
                  <p>He took great pleasure in drinking,<note place="margin">Subject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

in that exercise: but his ordinary divertisements were Women and Hunting, not much minding
matters of Government, or the administration of Justice to his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>He had three lawfull Wives,<note place="margin">His Wives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> one whereof was the Daughter of a Colonel; whose employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it had sometime been to drive the Mules which brought water to the King's Kitchin, and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47786:167"/>
came to be known to <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> by a service he did him one day while he was Hunting, in
helping him to some fair water, the weather being extremely hot, when no other could meet
with any. This service was requited by the Present the King made him of the Village of <hi>Bilou,</hi>
neer <hi>Nachtzuan,</hi> where this Mule-driver had been born. This was the first step or his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement,
and what made him noted at Court, where he found means to get an Office, which
is no hard matter in <hi>Persia</hi> for such as have money, and having some time after taken an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Wars, he prov'd so fortunate therein, that he got the command of a Regiment of
a thousand men. <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> thought his Daughter so handsom, that he made a Present of her
to his Daughter-law, <hi>Sefi-Myrsa</hi>'s Widdow, and appointed her to be brought up in order
to a Marriage between her and his Son <hi>Sain-Myrsa,</hi> since named <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi> who, at his
coming to the Crown, accordingly Married her.</p>
                  <p>The second Wife was a Christian, the Daughter of <hi>Tameras-Chan,</hi> a Prince of <hi>Georgia;</hi> and
this Marriage confirm'd the Peace which <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> made with that Prince.</p>
                  <p>The third was a <hi>Tartar</hi> of <hi>Circassia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Bika,</hi> and Sister to Prince <hi>Mussal,</hi>
of whom we have often spoken heretofore. The Mother brought her as far as the River <hi>Bustrou,</hi>
at the time of our Travels, and writ to <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi> that she sent him her Daughter, not as a
Concubine, or Slave; but as his lawfull Wife; That is was her hope he would look on her as
such, and that she should find from him a kindness and affection equal to that she her self had
express'd towards the Princess, his Mother, who, though she had been her Slave and had
often undress'd her even to her Stockins, had been treated, and look'd on by her, as if she had
been her own Daughter; That, on the contrary, rather than her Daughter should be ill treated,
she wish'd her drown'd, with all the misfortune that might happen to her, in the River <hi>Bustrou.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides these lawfull Wives,<note place="margin">His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines.</note> he had above three hundred Concubines; for, all the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somest
Maids all over <hi>Persia</hi> were brought to him. The greatest Lords themselves Present him
with the Maids they either have brought up in their own houses, or are found among their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
Of this we had an instance in our time in the <hi>Calenter</hi> of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> who having had
some ill Offices done him at the Court, recover'd the King's favour, by presenting him with his
own Neece, one of the greatest beauties of the Countrey, and a sum of money sent to the
Chancellor.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Armenians,</hi> to prevent the searches which are often made amongst them for Maids of
twelve years of age, dispose of them in Marriage, if they are handsom, before they come to
that age. By reason of this great number of Concubines, it happens, that the King lies with
some of them but once, and then bestows them on those Lords of the Court who are most in
his favour.</p>

                  <p>The Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> have the Provinces and Cities of their Kingdom Govern'd by <hi>Chans, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans,
Calenters, Darugas, Visirs,</hi> and <hi>Kauchas,</hi> dignities and employments which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
there according to valour and virtue, and not in consideration of birth and extraction.
Thence it comes that there are so many persons of such resolute courage, that they cheerfully
hazard their lives, as knowing it is the onely way to get into the greatest charges of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which are neither hereditary nor venal in <hi>Persia.</hi> 'Tis true, the Children of these Lords
are look'd upon,<note place="margin">Dignities not Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary.</note> with some respect to their Fathers, and that they enjoy their Estates,
but they are never advanc'd to their dignities, but purely upon the account of worth and
services, from which they are inseparable. The King never makes any <hi>Chan,</hi> but with the
title, he gives him where withall to maintain it, and that during his life, which many of them
lose meerly that they might be depriv'd of their quality.</p>
                  <p>Every Province hath its <hi>Chan,</hi> and its <hi>Calenter,</hi> who have their several Habitations in the
chief City. The <hi>Chan</hi> is as it were the Governor of the Province, and is entrusted with the
administration of Justice, with the power of putting his Judgements in Execution, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any Appeal. The <hi>Calenter</hi> hath the over-sight of the King's Demesn, and the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the Province, which he receives, and gives an account thereof to the Council, or, by
order from the King, to the <hi>Chan.</hi> The <hi>Daruga</hi> is, in a Citie, and the <hi>Kaucha,</hi> in a Village,
what the <hi>Chan</hi> is in respect of the Province. The <hi>Daruga</hi> do's also Execute the Function of
the <hi>Calenter</hi> in his Jurisdiction, but with a dependence on the Governour of the Province.
The King employes the <hi>Chans</hi> and <hi>Sulthans</hi> in the Embassies he sends to forein Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:47786:167"/>
but they are not so chargeable to him as some conceive, in regard he finds but one half of the
Presents which the Ambassador carries along with him, the Province, whereof he is Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
being oblig'd to defray all the rest of the Charge.</p>
                  <p>Most of the <hi>Chans</hi> are oblig'd to maintain a certain number of Soldiers, who are to be ready
to serve in the Armies, when any occasion requires: and in this is all the Revenue of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
spent, not including what is rais'd by way of Imposition, which is carried into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checquer.
Besides that, they also send the King certain New-years-Gifts, which are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.
The Provinces and Cities, which have no <hi>Chans,</hi> and are Governed by a <hi>Daruga,</hi>
as part of <hi>Georgia,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Caswin, Ispahan, Kascham, Theheram, Hemedan, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sched,
Kirman, Ormus,</hi> &amp;c. maintain no Soldiers, but pay Taxes to the King. The order
they observe, especially in the Frontier-Provinces, for the subsistence of so great a number of
Soldiers, is such, that it is no hard matter to raise a powerfull Army in a short time. And
indeed this the <hi>Schach</hi> makes very much his advantage of against the Potent Enemies he hath
about him, and by whom he is in a manner encompass'd of all sides, as the <hi>Vsbeques Tartars,</hi>
the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> He is never at quiet with the former, concerning the Frontiers of <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasan;</hi>
with the <hi>Mogul,</hi> about those of <hi>Candahar,</hi> and with the <hi>Turk,</hi> about the Provinces
of <hi>Bagdat</hi> and <hi>Eruan,</hi> for which they are in perpetual War, whence it comes that they often
change Masters.</p>

Musquets; but the Horse are Arm'd onely with Darts and Javelins. They have us'd Muskets
and great Guns but since the reign of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> nor do they use the latter so much in the
assault as defence of places; in as much as their Armies making ordinarily great dayes marches,
and with little or no Carriages, it would be troublesom to them to take great Guns along with
them, as such as would much retard their Expeditions. No slight or stratagem in War but they
are apt enough to make their advantage of. At the siege of <hi>Iruan,</hi> in the year 1633. they had
the invention of casting into the place, with their Arrows, small Glasses full of poyson, which
so infected the air, that the Garrison was extremely incommodated thereby, and made inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of handling their Arms,<note place="margin">Their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> for the defence of the place. They call the General of the Army

                  <p>
                     <hi>Kartzschucai-Chan,</hi> was the Son of a <hi>Christian,</hi> of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and had been sold to <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi>
who made him a <hi>Chan,</hi> and afterwards General of his Army. He acquir'd so great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
in that employment, that the <hi>Schach</hi> himself would needs be his Lacquey, as we said
elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salma-Chan,</hi> a <hi>Kurde</hi> by birth, had some time been an ordinary Groom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Emir-Kune-Chan</hi> was the Son of one of that kind of Shepheards, who live in Tents or Huts
upon the Mountains, &amp; grew so famous at the siege of <hi>Eruan,</hi> that the King entrusted him with
the Government of the whole Province. What a particular kindness <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> had for this
person, may be guess'd by the ensuing story.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> who lay before the Citie of <hi>Eruan,</hi> having rais'd the siege, <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> got
into the place, where he spent the best part of the night in drinking with <hi>Emir-Kune,</hi> wo grew
so familiar with him, that taking the King by the Mustachoes, he kiss'd his very mouth, yet
did not the King take it any way unkindly. <hi>Emir-Kune</hi> who remembred not what he had
done in his Wine, was much astonish'd when some gave him an accompt of what had pass'd the
next day, and so frightned thereat, that hanging his Cytimar about his Neck, he went in that
posture to the King's Chamber door, according to the custom observ'd by such as know they
have deserv'd death, and by that submission beg their Pardon. The King sent him word he
might come in, whereto the other having made answer that he was not worthy to set his foot
within the King's Chamber, having abus'd his goodness as he had, <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> comes out of
the Room, and took off the Cymitar from about his Neck, and deliver'd it to him, as an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his favour. But he strictly forbad him the drinking of any Wine ever after, in as much,
as being got drunk, he knew not what he did. Some time after <hi>Emir-Kune-Chan</hi> having in a
fight, been wounded in the Arm, and the Physicians having given it as their opinion, that
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:47786:168"/>
that abstinence would be prejudicial to his health, the King did not only take off the prohibition
he had made him, but sent him a certain number of Mules loaden with the best Wine in the
Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> hate and contemn Cowards,<note place="margin">The <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> hate Cowards.</note> and the Officers who neglect their duty in the
Wars are most severely punish'd. An instance hereof was seen in <hi>Aliculi-Chan,</hi> Governour of
<hi>Shorosan,</hi> who having let slip the opportunity of engaging <hi>Tameras,</hi> Prince of <hi>Georgia,</hi> though
he might have fought him with advantage, <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> caus'd him to be dress'd in Woman's
Cloaths, and so sent him to the Army, where he was walk'd up and down all day among the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
The allowance of a Hors-man is three hundred Crowns <hi>per ann.</hi> towards the keeping of
himself and his Horse; and that of a Muskettier two hundred. They have the reputation not to
be over-scrupulous in the keeping of their word, as was seen in the Capitulation they granted
the Garrison of <hi>Iruan,</hi> which was very ill observ'd.</p>
                  <p>Those who speak of the Wealth of the King of <hi>Persia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Schach</hi>'s Revenue.</note> think they speak of a vast and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sum, when they assign him a yearly Revenue of eight Millions of Gold, and imagine they
raise the Reader into admiration, when they affirm that the Province of <hi>Candahar</hi> alone brings
in yearly near a Million of Gold; that the Cities of <hi>Bagdat</hi> and <hi>Iruan,</hi> with the Country there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
pay in a manner as much, and that it hath been found by the Register's Office of the
Chancery, that the King gets out of the Suburbs of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and the Villages within the Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lywick
thereof, near forty thousand Crowns. But those who know, that the Province of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>
it self payes yearly such a sum as amounts to almost as much as all the King of <hi>Persia</hi>'s
Revenue, will grant there is no hyperbole in what we have affirm'd. This Revenue was very
much diminish'd in the time of King <hi>Tamas,</hi> when the <hi>Turks</hi> and other neighbouring Princes
over-run <hi>Persia,</hi> so as that they were possess'd of several Provinces belonging to that Crown.
Besides, there is hardly any Bridge or Passage, not only upon the Frontiers, but also all over
the Kingdom, nay, in all Cities almost, but there is somewhat to be paid, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of persons, Foreiners or Natives. All Merchandises pay, and the King takes, upon
every Bail of Silk, ten Crowns. There is no Horse sold, but pays xv. <hi>d.</hi> to the King; an Ox
as much, and an Ass one half, and a Sheep, which are as thick as Ants all over the Countrey,
iij. <hi>d.</hi> a piece. The King lets out the <hi>Caravanseras,</hi> which are in Cities, and are appointed for
Lodgings for Foremers and VVare-houses for Merchants, especially at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where
there are twenty five of them, of which not any payes less then five thousand Crowns
<hi>per ann.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He Farms out also the Fishing of the Rivers, the Baths, and Stoves, the places of publick
Prostitution, and the Springs of <hi>Nefte.</hi> He sells also the water which comes into the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and raises only from the River of <hi>Senderut,</hi> at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> the yearly sum of sixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Crowns. All the <hi>Armenian</hi> Christians, whereof there is a very great number in <hi>Persia,</hi>
pay yearly a Poll-money, of two Crowns for every head. Nay, what is more, there is not a
person, those only excepted, who are maintain'd by, or have some relation to the King, but
payes a Tax proportionably to what he gets, even to the very Midwife, I say nothing here of
the Presents brought the king from all parts, and which fall by several Chanels into the Prince's
Treasury. The great Lords, though they make good the king's Revenue, yet abate nought of
their own advantages, and find wayes to fleece the Countrey, so as that it is not to be admir'd
there is so little wealth to be found among the people. For there is nothing so true as what a
certain Emperour sometime said, that it is impossible the spleen should be swollen in any
body, and that the other Members of the same body should not be wasted and become
Hectick.</p>
                  <p>'Twas also <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> who ordered the melting down of seven thousand and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Marks of Gold for the making of the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

still produce at the entertainments they make Foreiners, and consists for the most part in
Dishes, Pots, Flaggons, and other Drinking-Cups.</p>
                  <p>What we said before of the Military Officers,<note place="margin">Officers of the Court.</note> to wit, that they were most of them but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
clad, is as true in those Officers who belong to the Court. For there was hardly any one,
who could make ostentation of but ordinary Parentage.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eatemad Dowlet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chancellor.</note> or Chancellor, who was the President of the king's Council, the Soul
of affairs, the principal Minister of State, and as it were Viceroy of <hi>Persia,</hi> was the Son of one
who got his livelyhood by writing at <hi>Mesanderan,</hi> as we have said elsewhere. These Scriven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
as I may call them, are employ'd only in the Coppying and Transcribing of Books, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they have not as yet, ia this Countrey, the use of Printing, as we have in <hi>Europe.</hi> He is
called <hi>Eahtemad Dowlet,</hi> in regard he hath the oversight of the kings Revenues and Treasury.
This was the most self-concern'd person of all that ever had the management of publick affairs,
as a Minister of State. For there was no business done at Court, whereof he made not some
advantage; and there was no charge or employment to be gotten, but the person petitioning
for it must have made his agreement with the Chancellor; whose exactions were, in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
excessive, not only upon the accompt of the Presents, which, being made by him twice
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47786:168"/>
every year to the Court, rendred the king himself in a manner a complice of his concussions,
but also upon this consideration, that being an Eunuch, all the Wealth he got was at his death
to fall to the king.</p>

Son of <hi>Schamlu,</hi> who, in the time of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> had been a Menial servant to a Lord of
the Court. These Horse, in time of Peace, retire to their own Habitation, yet are paid as duely
as if they were in actual service, and meet not again till there be an Army on foot, enjoying in
the mean time divers Privileges and Exemptions, which the other later kings of <hi>Persia</hi> have
granted them.</p>

he needed not be Circumcis'd to receive the Character of the <hi>Persian</hi> Religion. He had been a
Page, attending in his Chamber, to <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> and was much in favour with <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi>
upon this account, that being alwayes near the king's person, in all both Publick and Private
Assemblies, nay, even within the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> he had the king's Ear, and knew how to comply
with his humour, and make his advantage of the opportunities he had to speak to him, by which
means he obtain'd those favours of him, which another could not have ask'd.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Rica,</hi> are men who carry Pole-Axes, and are alwayes about the king's person, as his
Guards; but sometimes they also do the work of common Executioners.</p>
                  <p>All these Officers have their Salaries and other Allowances, which are very duely paid them,
not out of the Treasury or Exchequer, but they are charg'd upon the Demesn of certain Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whereof they themselves have the disposal, or they are assign'd them out of some part of
the Taxes, or haply on the Tribute paid by common Prostitutes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> seldom meet about affairs, but the Cloath is lay'd. At the two Audiences the
king gave us, as well at our comming thither, as our departure thence, we Din'd with him, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:47786:169"/>
at all the conferences we had at the Chancellor's, we alwayes found a Collation of Preserves, and
after that the Cloath was lay'd, and the Meat serv'd up.</p>

of the Court, he is ordinarily attended by the <hi>Hakim,</hi> or Physician, the <hi>Seder,</hi> and the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natzim.</hi>
The Physician appoints what Mears he should eat of. The <hi>Minatzim,</hi> or Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
acquaints him with the fortunate and unfortunate hours, and whatever he sayes is believ'd
as Oraculous: and the <hi>Seder,</hi> who is the chief of their Ecclesiasticks, explicates to him those
passages of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and such points of their Divinity, where there seems to be any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
The King and the <hi>Kasi</hi> joyn together in the naming of the <hi>Seder,</hi> and they make choice
of him among those, whom they think best skill'd in the explication of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and the
Laws which depend on it. They take his advice not onely in Ecclesiastical, but also in Civil
affairs, but especially in Criminal. He is shew'd the charge and proceedings against the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and he returns his advice seal'd with his Seal. The King for the most part follows it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
these words, <hi>This is the advice of the</hi> Seder, <hi>which we confirm;</hi> then he orders his own
Seal to be set thereto.</p>
                  <p>Civil causes are commonly try'd before the Secular Judges whom they call <hi>Oef.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Iustice.</note> They are a
kind of Lawyers according to their way, and they have for their chief the <hi>Diwan-beki,</hi> who
ought to be well vers'd in the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Their Pleading dayes are <hi>Monday</hi> and
<hi>Thursday,</hi> and the place where they meet for the administration of Justice, is a spacious Arch'd
Hall under the Palace-Gate, where they hear both sides, and if the Causes be of importance,
they report the same to the King, and acquaint him with the opinions of the Judges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King decides them.</p>
                  <p>It is forbidden by their Law to put out money to use.<note place="margin">Vsury for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</note> Yet they stick not to do it; but if the
Usurers be discovered, they are look'd on as infamous persons, and not admitted into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of such as are of any quality, nay, they are also very severely punish'd. Of this we saw
an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ample as we pass'd through <hi>Ardebil,</hi> where they had an odd way to take out a Man's Teeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who, by way or interest, had taken one and a half in the hundred for a moneth's time. They
lay'd him all along on the ground, and knock'd out his Teeth one after another with a little
Mallet. They call this kind of Usurers <hi>Sudehur,</hi> that is, eaters of Interest of Usury, The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
are permitted to lay out mony upon Lands, Gardens, and Houses, which they enjoy
while they are out of their money, and if they be not redeem'd within the time agreed upon
between the parties, they are forfeited to the Mortgagee.</p>
                  <p>Their punishments are cruel,<note place="margin">Their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</note> and proportionable to the irreclaimable obstinacy of that people
who are violently bent to Vice, and laugh at gentle chastisements, and moderate pains. The
least Crimes are punish'd with mutilation of Members. They cut off the Nose, Ears, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Feet and Hands of Malefactors, nay, they are put to death, by cutting off thier
Heads. That defiling, which the <hi>Latines</hi> call <hi>Violatio,</hi> is not punish'd with death, but they
think it enough to cut off the part which hath offended, to prove which, there needs onely the
Woman's Oath, if she hath the confidence to reiterate it thrice. The two last Kings, <hi>Schach
Abas</hi> and <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi> have been rather cruel than severe in their punishments, as may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
from the examples we have already produc'd thereof, nay, they have been so far such
towards some Criminals, that they have caus'd them to be ty'd between two boards and sawen
asunder. <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> had sent into <hi>Spain</hi> one named <hi>Teinksbeg,</hi> who returning from his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy,
and having not brought home all his Retinue, and the King understanding by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,
that his ill usage of them had caus'd many of his people to run away, he took the pains
himself to cut off his Nose, his Ears, and a good piece of flesh out of his Arm, and forc'd him
immediately to eat them, bloody and raw as they were. <hi>Imanculi-Chan,</hi> who was sent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
to the Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> our Master, treated his Domesticks no better. For a very
trivial fault, he caus'd a Spit red hot to be apply'd to the back of one of his Retinue; and he
order'd another's fingers to be knock'd with the back of an Hatchet, till all the bones were
bruis'd: which oblig'd five or six of his Train to leave his service, and return into <hi>Persia</hi> by the
way of <hi>Italy:</hi> for which cruelties he had no doubt been punish'd at his return, had not the
Chancellor made his peace with the King.</p>
                  <p>As to the Religion of these people, I could make a long digression, to give some accompt
of that of the antient <hi>Persians,</hi> and shew how they ador'd the Sun, Moon, Venus, Fire, and
other things, which they made Divinities; but it is besides my design, and therefore I shall
onely say something of that of the modern, and the difference there is, between the Religion
of the <hi>Persians</hi> and that of the <hi>Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Both these Nations follow the Doctrine of that grand Impostor <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </note> and acknowledge
the same <hi>Alcoran;</hi> yet do's not that hinder, but they have a mortal animosity one against the
other. And whereas their enmity is chiefly grounded on the difference of their Religions, we
shall here briefly shew wherein it consists.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Busbeque</hi> sayes in the third Letter of his Embassy to <hi>Turkey,</hi> that a man may judge
of the difference of these two Religions, from the conversation he had with a <hi>Persian Visir,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47786:170"/>
                     <hi>Rustan,</hi> who told him, that the <hi>Persians</hi> had a greater hatred for the <hi>Turks,</hi> and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them much more profane than the <hi>Christians;</hi> but he gives no other particular thereof.
Others, who have written of the same subject, as <hi>Paulus Iovius, Bizarrus, Minadous,</hi> and
a certain <hi>English</hi> Gentleman, named <hi>Thomas Herbert,</hi> have given no better an accompt of it;
some, by reason of the little acquaintance they had therewith, and others out of negligence,
having not deliver'd what they might have learn't during the aboad they made in <hi>Persia.</hi> I have
had the curiosity to make a stricter enquiry into it, and to inform my self as well from such
as I became intimately acquainted withall at <hi>Scamachie</hi> and <hi>Ispahan,</hi> by means of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
as by the reading of some Books, which I have compar'd with what I had learnt thereof
my self.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> are as free to assume the quality of <hi>Mussulman</hi>'s as the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the word <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulman.</hi>
                     </note> This word is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from that of <hi>Salama,</hi> which comes from another <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, which signifies, <hi>he hath
deliver'd,</hi> or <hi>saved.</hi> And the reason of it is, that the <hi>Mahumetane</hi> Religion, being to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
it self by Arms, and the <hi>Alcoram</hi> ordering those to be presecuted and kill'd, who refus'd
to pronounce this confession, <hi>Ia illah illalahu, Mahumeda resul-alla,</hi> that is, <hi>There is no other
God but one, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>the Apostle of God,</hi> such as, by this profession, <hi>saved</hi> themselves
from, or avoided death, were called <hi>Mussulmans,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>saved</hi> or <hi>delivered.</hi> But
the present <hi>Turks</hi> explicate it otherwise, and affirm, that they who make profession of their
Religion, are <hi>Mussulmans,</hi> that is, <hi>sav'd</hi> from eternal damnation. Whence it comes, that
they do not call their Sons <hi>Mussulmans,</hi> till they are Circumcis'd.</p>
                  <p>The Circumcision of the <hi>Persians</hi> is not celebrated,<note place="margin">Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> till the Children are seven, eight, or nine
years of age, and then they intoxicate such as are to be Circumcis'd, with a certain drink, to
make them insensible of the pain they are to endure, in the cutting of the Prepuce; and in this
they agree with the <hi>Turks.</hi> But the difference between their Religion and that of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
consists.</p>

                     <item>1. In that they explicate not the <hi>Alcoran</hi> after the same manner.</item>

                     </note> in as much as <hi>Mahomet,</hi> having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by his last Will and Testament, that <hi>Aly,</hi> his Nephew, and Son-in-law, (for he was
the Brother's Son and had Married his Daughter <hi>Fattima</hi>) should succeed him, as well in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals
as Spirituals, <hi>Ababeker, Omar,</hi> and <hi>Osman,</hi> all three Father-in-law's of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
who were more considerable and powerfull then <hi>Aly,</hi> and had contributed much to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and establishment of <hi>Mahumet</hi>'s Religion, usurped, successively one after another, the
<hi>Califate,</hi> and Political Government of their Son-in-law, notwithstanding the opposition, which
<hi>Aly</hi> and his friends would have made against it. 'Twas after their death, that <hi>Aly</hi> obtain'd
the <hi>Califate,</hi> which yet he was not so possess'd of, but that it was pretended to, and, disputed
against him, by the relations of the three last <hi>Califs. Aly</hi> did not change any thing in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi>
and though he gave several Interpretations to the words of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and explicated
the sense of his Law, yet did he submit to his Authority, where it was clear, and where the
Text admitted no explication, in so much that this occasion'd no change in the Religion.</p>
                  <p>But about the year 1363.<note place="margin">The initials of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>
                     </note> there happen'd to be at <hi>Ardebil,</hi> a very learned man, named <hi>Sofi,</hi>
who pretended himself deriv'd from the Family of <hi>Aly,</hi> and gave out, that he was, in a right
line, descended from <hi>Musai Kasim,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hossein,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Aly.</hi> The auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his life, and the outward innocency of his demeanour, manag'd by an understanding
that had the knack of making the most advantageous discoveries it could of it self, brought him
into great reputation, and rais'd him to the quality of <hi>Schich.</hi> He slighted, at least in appearance,
all the pleasures and enjoyments of this World, clad himself in a Sheep-skin, and would
not wear any thing about him but what was of Wool. Some affirm, that he had the name <hi>Sofi</hi>
given him, from the word <hi>Suff,</hi> which signifies <hi>Wool,</hi> though others are of opinion, and that
with greater probability, that the true Etymology of his name is deriv'd from the word <hi>Sefid,</hi>
which signifies <hi>pale</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> in as much as it is the custom of the <hi>Persians,</hi> many times, to
give the sirname from the colour of the face, as the Chancellor of <hi>Persia,</hi> who liv'd at the
time of our Embassy thither, was named <hi>Saru Tagge,</hi> from the yellowish colour of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sofi</hi> was the first who ventured publickly to teach and write, that the succession of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
which belong'd to <hi>Aly,</hi> his Nephew and Son-in-law, had been illegally usurped from
him and his Posterity, by <hi>Abubeker, Omar,</hi> and <hi>Osman:</hi> That God, who had been very
much offended at that procedure, had rais'd him the said <hi>Sofi,</hi> and had endu'd him with all qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
necessary for the restauration of the glory of <hi>Aly,</hi> which had been in a manner buried for
many ages. And to make it appear, that <hi>Aly</hi> was a man after God's heart, he reviv'd a great
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:47786:170"/>
number of Miracles, which he said had been suppress'd by the malice of the <hi>Turks:</hi> That <hi>Aly</hi>
had given a true explication of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which his Successor, <hi>Tzafersaduck,</hi> had reduc'd
into writing, and that in those Commentaries there were many precepts contrary to the opinions
of <hi>Hanife,</hi> whom the <hi>Turks</hi> follow, but much more rational. There is not any Nation in the
World more inclin'd to change, and more addicted to Novelty, than the <hi>Persians. Sofi</hi>'s new
Doctrine soon found credit among them, in so much that they forsook that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> in
whom this Schism heightned the animosity which neighbourhood and perpetual Wars about the
Frontiers had already but too much blown between those two Nations. However, the <hi>Persians</hi>
made it their business to confirm the reputation of their <hi>Aly,</hi> and added to their Creed, whereof
we spoke before, these words <hi>Aaly welli Alla,</hi> so that they said, <hi>There is but one God,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet
<hi>the Apostle of God and Aly,</hi> Coadjutor <hi>or Lieutenant of God:</hi> Nay, they presume to
affirm, that though <hi>Aly</hi> be not really God, yet he comes very neer him. And to prefer him
even before <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself, they add hereto, that it was God's intention to bestow the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi>
on <hi>Aly,</hi> and that it was by mistake it fell into the hands of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> But as to <hi>Abube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
Omar,</hi> and <hi>Osman,</hi> they who at Prayer time call the people together (for the <hi>Persians,</hi> as
well as the <hi>Turks,</hi> use no Bells) will be sure to Curse these three pretended Prophets, and to
execrate them to the pit of Hell. They have commonly these words in their mouth, <hi>Kiri Sekder
deheni Abubeker, Omar, Osman, Hanifebad,</hi> that is, <hi>many Dogs stones stop the mouths of these
Prophets,</hi> which is an abomination to the ears of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who, upon this accompt are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
irreconcileable Enemies to the <hi>Persians,</hi> especially since <hi>Sedredin</hi> and <hi>Tzinid,</hi> (whom
some name <hi>Gutnet</hi>) express'd so great a zeal for the establishment and advancement of their
Sect, which is, in process of time, grown so strong, that their <hi>Schichs</hi> are become <hi>Schachs,</hi>
that is their <hi>Prophets</hi> have chang'd their quality into that of <hi>Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> not thinking it enough to have establish'd the <hi>Sanctity,</hi>

                     </note> nay, in some measure
the <hi>Divinity,</hi> of <hi>Aly,</hi> were of opinion that he had communicated some part of that quality to
those of his Family, and that they might bestow the denomination of Saints upon his first Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
of whom there were related many Miracles, whereby their memories have been cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,

is to remain till the day of Judgement, which is to be, when his shooes, which he left at the
entrance of it, and which are already turn'd half way, shall be quite turned towards the Cave,
so as that at his coming out he may put his feet into them, to go and convert all the World to
the Faith of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On these twelve Saints they bestow the quality of <hi>Imam,</hi> or Prelate. To these, as also to
the Institutor of their Sect <hi>Schich-Sosi,</hi> they address their Prayers and Devotions, and it is to
the four Sepulchres of them, that they go on Pilgrimages, especially when their affairs permit
them not to go to <hi>Meca,</hi> or <hi>Medina.</hi> They give the Pilgrims a Certificate or Testimonial, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

<hi>Persian</hi> Religion; but there is also a further particular advantage of these Testimonials, in that
they save their lives, who are in disgrace with the Kings or Governours of the Provinces where
they live. We have seen instances hereof in our Interpreter, whose name was <hi>Rustam,</hi> who
took one of them, to avoid the punishment which he migh have suffered for embracing the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Religion in <hi>England,</hi> and another in <hi>Tzirrachan,</hi> who took this course to save himself, as

of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi> execrate the memory of the three former, and speak of
the last as an Impostor, who hath made false explications of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> They affirm, that
<hi>Hanife,</hi> being a servant to <hi>Tzafur Saduk,</hi> was very carefull to preserve the water, wherein that
Saint had wash'd his hands, which he carried into <hi>Turkey,</hi> rubb'd therewith the eyes of several
blind people, who by that means recover'd their sight, and wrought divers other Miracles, the
honour whereof belongs only to the Saints of <hi>Persia.</hi> They add to this, that <hi>Schach Tamas,</hi>
after the taking of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> caus'd the body of <hi>Hanife,</hi> who had a very sumptuous Tomb there,
to be taken up; and that he converted the <hi>Masur,</hi> or place of his Sepulture, into a Stable, and
the Sepulchre into a Sink or common House of ease.</p>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:47786:171"/>
of <hi>Hembili,</hi> and <hi>Maleki.</hi> The <hi>Alcoran,</hi> in many places, is not to be understood; not
only in that <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself seems to have affected obscurity, as not knowing himself what
he would say; but also in this regard, that, many times, he alludes to stories which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
never happened, and whereof the Commentators certainly having no knowledge, have
supply'd the defect with their own fictions, fables, and impostures, which have no likelyhood
of truth in them. But not to digress from the <hi>Persians,</hi> whom it is our particular design here to
give an accompt of, it is a thing much to be admir'd, that these people, who are so ingenious,
and so wise in their Generation, and so excellently well vers'd in the affairs of the World,
could be brought to believe things so ridiculous, and the many fables, their Books of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are fill'd with. As for instance, among others, that <hi>Duldul,</hi> (so they call <hi>Aly</hi>'s Horse)
was got of a Rock. That it was the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> who brought him the Sword, called <hi>Dzul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fakar,</hi>
wherewith he did so many great exploits: That with the said Sword, he kill'd a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
that had seven heads; and cut a Devil to pieces. And that <hi>Sulthan Mahomet Chodabende,</hi>
being one day a-hunting neer <hi>Kufa,</hi> discover'd thereabouts a Sepulchre with this Inscription,
<hi>Vnder this place ly</hi> Adam, Noe, and Aly, and that thereupon the <hi>Sulthan</hi> had ordered the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Citie of <hi>Netzef,</hi> where he had erected a Tomb in memory of <hi>Aly.</hi> But there is
not any thing so ridiculously flat as the story they relate of <hi>Aly</hi>'s drinking with the Angels in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.</p>
                  <p>And that there may be no scruple made of the supernatural,<note place="margin">Miracles.</note> and as it were Divine power, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
by them to the Author of their Sect, they relate a great number of Miracles wrought
by him, which Miracles indeed are chargeable with some imposture among those of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
but in the Religion of the <hi>Persians,</hi> they are the more impertinent, in that they make
their Saints do them, without any necessity. As for instance, when they affirm, that <hi>Schich
Sofi,</hi> being yet very young, and going to see <hi>Schich Sahadi,</hi> who was a great Saint, and a very
wise man, and liv'd in the Village of <hi>Sahedan,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> he there took parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
notice of the pains the Inhabitants were at in weeding their Grounds, and moved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
thereat, he commanded the Weeds not to pester the Earth any longer. He was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
obey'd. But <hi>Schich Sahadi</hi> observing it, said to him; I see, Son, what thou art able
to do; but thou art to consider, that if thou ease these Pesants of the employment wherein they
spend their time, they will be lost through idleness. <hi>Schich-Sofi</hi> thought this so excellent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that he presently resolv'd to serve that holy man, with whom he continu'd seven
years, and learnt of <hi>Sahadi</hi> many noble things. It is upon this accompt, as they affirm, that
the said Village, to this day enjoyes an absolute and perpetual privilege and exemption.</p>
                  <p>They relate also that <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> whom they call <hi>Temurleng,</hi> desirous to see <hi>Schich-Sofi,</hi> and
to be assur'd whether his Sanctity was answerable to the great reputation he had acquir'd all over
the East, resolv'd to give him a Visit, and to have an evident Demonstration of the truth of his
Doctrine, he bethought himself to make a tryal of it, with a resolution to rest satisfy'd as to
his Sanctity, if he behav'd himself in three things as he expected he should; to wit, 1. if he
came not out to meet him: 2. If he entertain'd him with Rice, boyl'd, not in Sheep's Milk,
but that of wild Goats: and 3. If the poyson he would order to be given him, should not kill
him. Hereupon <hi>Tamberlane</hi> being come to <hi>Schamasbu,</hi> where <hi>Sofi</hi> then liv'd, went streight to
his Chamber, <hi>Sofi</hi> saw him well enough coming, but would not go to meet him, till <hi>Tamberlane</hi>
had set foot within his Chamber: then <hi>Sofi</hi> rose up, and said to him, I know well enough what
respect is due to the King, but it was your pleasure I should not meet you. I humbly crave your
pardon. 'Tis a tryal you were pleas'd to make of me. This Complement pass'd, he made
<hi>Tamberlane</hi> sit down, opposite to the Door, and caus'd to come of the neighbouring Forrest a
great many wild Goats, which were milked in <hi>Tamberlane</hi>'s presence. At last <hi>Sofi</hi> perceiving
they were going to give him poyson; call'd for a clean shirt, which he put on, and having drunk
the poyson, he fell a dancing round the Room, according to the manner of the <hi>Schichs,</hi> and
continu'd that exercise so long, till such time as having put himself into a sweat all over the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
he took off the shirt, out of which he wrung the sweat, which the poyson had made of a
Green colour, and having put it into a Glass, presented it to <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> to satisfie him that it
had done him no harm. That thereupon <hi>Tamberlane</hi> made no further doubt of the truth of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi</hi>'s
Doctrine; that he bestow'd on him several Villages near <hi>Ard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bil,</hi> and made him a Present
of a great number of <hi>Turks,</hi> whom he was to instruct in his Religion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> believe not a word of all these Miracles; but however, they have a great Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for the memory of <hi>Aly.</hi> They acknowledge he was a near Kinsman of <hi>Mohomet</hi>'s, that
he is truly an <hi>Iman,</hi> or Saint, and that he led a very exemplary life; and particularly that he
was valiant, and a very good Horsman; and thence it comes, that, when they get on Hors-back,
they say <hi>Isa Aly,</hi> in the name of <hi>Aly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Persians</hi> will not admit of any of the Laws and Ordinances which <hi>Abubekar,</hi>

                     <hi>Omar,
Osman,</hi> and <hi>Hanife,</hi> affirm to be grounded on the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> so they also contemn all the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Ceremonies of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and have particular ones of their own, which they believe to
be as necessary, as any thing that is most essential in the business of Religion. For instance,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47786:171"/>
when the <hi>Persians</hi> intend to do their Devotions, especially their Prayers, they prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by external ablution as the Turks do, but after an absolutely different manner. They
turn up their sleeves above the Elbow, wash their hands, which they afterwards put, two seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times upon the Arms, stroaking them from the Elbow down to the Wrist. Then they stroak
their faces only with the right hand. The <hi>Turks,</hi> on the contrary, take up so much water as
they can hold between their hands, and therewith rub their faces, stroaking them three several
times, from the Forehead down to the Chin, and afterwards from the Chin up to the Forehead.
They wash also their Noses and Mouths, by drawing in with their breath the water, which, to
that end, they take up between their hands. The <hi>Persians</hi> stroak their Heads with a moist
hand, from the Nape of the Neck to the Forehead, and afterwards the Feet up to the Ancles.
But the <hi>Turks</hi> pour water on their Heads, and so apply their moist Hand to the Feet, which they
are oblig'd to wash, before they begin these Ceremonies: but this the <hi>Persians</hi> do not. The
<hi>Turks</hi> put the fore-finger into the Ear, which they afterwards rub all about with the Thumb,
and then with the same fore-finger stroke their Heads from the Nape of the Neck, to the
Throat. These Ceremonies are perform'd in their Houses, before they go out in order to the
doing of their Devotions, in the <hi>Mosquey;</hi> whither the Women come not at all, out of a fear
they might distract the Devotions of the men. The <hi>Persians</hi> have a stone, wherewith they often
touch their forehead, while they are at their Prayers; or haply they lay the stone upon the
ground, and touch it with their foreheads. It is made of a greyish Earth, which is to be had
about <hi>Metzef</hi> and <hi>Kufa,</hi> where <hi>Hossein</hi> was kill'd, and interr'd, near <hi>Aly,</hi> and thence it is that
the said stone derives all its vertue. The Figure of it is Octogonal, and it is somewhat above
three inches Diameter, and contains, with the names of their twelve Saints, that of <hi>Fattima,</hi>
their common Mother. They are made by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who bring them into <hi>Persia</hi> to be
sold.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> being come to the <hi>Mosquey</hi> begin their Prayers with <hi>Alla Ekber.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> When they
Pray, their Arms hang down negligently, and they have their eyes fasten'd on the ground. On
the contrary, the <hi>Turks</hi> have both their hands upon their Breasts. The <hi>Persians,</hi> afterwards,
put their hands upon their Ears, and turn their faces to the South, out of this regard, that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
and <hi>Medina</hi> are towards that Quarter, in respect of the Citie of <hi>Ardebil,</hi> where their Sect
had its first Institution and Original. There is some probability, that, in this particular, they
would imitate the primitive <hi>Christians,</hi> who, in their Prayers, turn'd their faces towards the
East, to express, that <hi>Christ,</hi> their Sun of Righteousness, was risen. Whence it came that the
<hi>Christians</hi> being charg'd in the time of <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour, as if they ador'd the Sun, <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
vindicates them in his Apology, and gives an accompt of the true cause of that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> having thus turn'd their faces towards the South, begin their Prayers with that
of <hi>Allhemdo lilla.</hi> Having said that, they set their Hands on their Knees, and in that stooping
posture they say the Prayer <hi>Subhanna Rebbi,</hi> and repeat the <hi>Alla Ekber.</hi> Then they kneel down,
touch their foreheads with the grey stone, and repeat the foresaid Prayer of <hi>Subhanna Rebbi,</hi>
stretching out their Arms. After all this, they make the last Prayer upon their Knees, then rise
up, and turning to the left and right hand, they pronounce with a low voice, <hi>Salom alekom,
Salom alekom,</hi> saluting the Angels who have assisted them, and kept the Devil from disturbing
them in their Devotions, The <hi>Turks</hi> salute the Angels before they have quite made an end of
their Prayers. The Religion of the <hi>Persians</hi> obliges them to say their Prayers five times a day,
to wit, in the morning at Sun-rising, at noon, in the afternoon, in the evening, and as they go
to bed. Their chief Prayer is the <hi>Fatah,</hi> and next to that, the <hi>Allhemdo lilla,</hi> which Translated
is to this effect. <hi>Glory be to the Lord of all Creatures, to the King of the last judgement. We ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thee; we invoke thee; assist us in our necessities; Lead us in thy wayes; bring us into the path
of those to whom thou hast done good, and not into the way of those, upon whom thou hast poured out
thy wrath, nor into that of such as thou suffrest to go astray.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>And whereas all the Chapters of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> begin with these words,<note place="margin">They are very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>bismilla rahman rahim,</hi>
in the name of God, &amp;c. the <hi>Persians</hi> accordingly never undertake any thing, but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the <hi>bismilla,</hi> and sometimes say, <hi>benahm ohnki namesch heres tzanehaft,</hi> that is, in his
name, who is the refuge and protection of Souls, they express a great attention and devotion in
their Prayers; insomuch that going sometimes into the great <hi>Metschid Mehedi,</hi> at <hi>Ispahan,</hi>
at the time when they were at Prayers, I could never observe, that they so much as took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of me; but they had their eyes either fastened on the ground, or lifted them up to Heaven,
according to the subject of their Prayers. There are some among them, who pray with such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
at their own houses, that they put themselves out of breath, and many times fall down in
a swound. I remember to this effect a story of one of my Neighbours at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> who was
so earnest in his Devotion, that having said his Prayer very loud, and pronounc'd with all his
might, above fifty times the word <hi>Hakka,</hi> which signifies, God, he at length could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it without a great deal of difficulty, and at last his voice quite fail'd him. There are
some, who, at their Prayers use a certain kind of Beads, which they call <hi>Moher Thebish,</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of three dozen, distinguish'd by so many great Beads.</p>

Upon <hi>Friday,</hi> which is their ordinary Festival, their <hi>Chaltib,</hi> or Preacher, gets up into
the Pulpit, and reads certain Chapters of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> with the explication thereof. They
make no account at all of our Bible, and say it hath been falsify'd by the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> and
that for that reason God sent the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as a Corrected Bible, or the true word of God.
While I was at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> I shew'd the <hi>Minatzim Chalil,</hi> the Pentateuck in <hi>Arabick.</hi> He
knew the book well enough, but said of it, <hi>Chrabdur,</hi> that is, it is a book that's corrupt and
abolish'd; the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is much the better.</p>
                  <p>They have very strange and extravagant opinions concerning the Creation of the World,<note place="margin">Their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Heaven and Hell.</note>
the first man, the stories of the Bible, the last judgement and eternal life. They affirm, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other things, that, at the beginning, God made seven Hells, &amp; as many Paradises, but
that to the foresaid number there was an eighth Paradise added, upon the following occasion.
<hi>Ath,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and Grand-father of <hi>Nimroth,</hi> one of the most powerfull Princes of his
time, grew so vain-glorious and proud, that he would be respected as a God: and to the end
there should not any thing of Magnificence be wanting, he lay'd out several Millions of Gold,
in building the noblest and most Sumptuous Palace, that the Wit and Art of man could imagine,
which was to serve him for a Paradise. But the King being upon his way to go and see it, and
take possession thereof, there rose up such a thick Mist, which so cover'd the House and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
that were about it, that it seemed to have quite vanish'd, so that it could never yet be
found: and that this is the eighth Paradise, which God hath joyned to the other seven.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> have also the custom of dedicating or devoting their Children to some Saint,<note place="margin">They dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Children to Saints.</note> as
soon as they come out of the Mother's Womb, to which Saint they are to be as it were Slaves
as long as they live. As a badge of this slavery, they make a hole in their Ears, as soon as
they are born, and thence it is they have the name of <hi>Mahumedculi, Imanculi, Aaliculi,</hi>
that is, the Slaves of <hi>Mahomet, Iman,</hi> and <hi>Aaly.</hi> This they ordinarily do, when they are
some years married before they have Children, or when the Children thrive not well. There are
also some who devote them to a Monastical life, and promise to make them <hi>Abdallas.</hi> And
yet if the Children that have been so design'd express no inclination to a Monastical life, they
may go to some holy place, and for a sum of money be dispens'd of their Father's vow.</p>
                  <p>They have also a Lent or Fast,<note place="margin">Their Lent.</note> which lasts a moneth every year. They call it <hi>Rusch,</hi> or,
with the <hi>Turks Orutz,</hi> and they begin and end it, according to the prescription of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>
with the Moon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the moneth <hi>Ramesan.</hi> They observe it with somewhat more austerity than
the ordinary Fasts, in as much as they neither eat nor drink between Sun-rising and Sun-set:
but they have all the night to do what they please in, and they commonly spend it so well, that
they never fast less than they do at that time. For having sufficiently furnish'd themselves with
Meat and Wine in the night, they ly down in the morning, and sleep away part of the day.
Such as are unwilling to fast, may, for money, get a dispensation.</p>
                  <p>There is in <hi>Persia</hi> a sort of people whom they call <hi>Seid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</hi>
                     </note> and they are of the Posterity of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
and <hi>Aly,</hi> and enjoy several particular Privileges and Exemptions. They do not shave
their heads as the other <hi>Persians</hi> do, but onely cut their hair about the breadth of two fingers,
and let the rest grow, which they tie up together in a tress. They are not permitted to marry
out of their own Family, in regard the Alliances they might make elsewhere would much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
the King's Revenue. They are clad in white, and their shooes are low and flat-soal'd.
They are forbidden not onely the drinking of Wine, but also being in the place where any is
Drunk; so that if they are invited to any entertainment, the other Guests must be content with
<hi>Duschab,</hi> or onely water. The touching of a Dog renders them unclean. One untruth would
forfeit all their Privileges; and whereas all the other <hi>Persians</hi> swear by the name of God, <hi>Aly,
Schich-Sofi,</hi> and by the <hi>Beyamber ba embia,</hi> that is, by the Posterity of <hi>Aaly,</hi> these <hi>Seid</hi> have
no other Oath than that of <hi>Eulademen,</hi> that is, by my birth. Those of them who live in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are commonly rich, in regard they are possess'd of Lands and Villages, for which they pay
not the King any thing, whence it comes they are sufficiently proud and insupportable. There
are some who assume the quality of <hi>Seid,</hi> though they go from Citie to Citie, and live by
Alms. They shew their Testimonials where they come, but they are for the most part Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
and such as make use of them are accounted Impostors; and thence it is they call them
<hi>Cher-Seid,</hi> that is, Saints-Asses. Some of these last mentioned carry, about them, some hair,
in round boxes of silver, which they say was taken off <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s head, and have the sleight
to make the several hairs come streight out at a little hole, perswading the simple, that that is
done by some supernatural and miraculous vertue. This hair they fell at a very dear rate, and
the <hi>Persians</hi> make use of it in their Devotions, putting it upon their books, when they say
their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Kimas,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> there was one of these Mountebanks, who having
found out the trick of setting Cotton on fire by means of a Chrystal cut half round, and held in
the Sun like a burning-glass, would have people perswaded by that Operation, which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
to be Supernatural, that he was of the Kindred of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> After our return to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein,</hi>
I shew'd the <hi>Persians,</hi> whom <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi> sent thither, that it was the easiest thing in the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:47786:172"/>
World to get fire from the Sun, and I lighted paper in the very depth of Winter, by means
of a Chrystall full of cold Water, or a piece of Ice, which I had made half round in a Pewter
Dish. They were astonish'd at it, and said, that if I had done as much in <hi>Persia,</hi> I should have
pass'd there for either a great Saint, or a Sorcerer.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another sort of Ecclesiasticks in <hi>Persia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Another sort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men.</note> who are thought to be descended from
<hi>Aly,</hi> instead whereof the <hi>Turks</hi> have the <hi>Dervis,</hi> of whom the <hi>Kulesthan</hi> makes many pleasant
stories. These are called <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s, and are a kind of Monks or Friers. They are very meanly
clad, with a kind of sleeve-less Coat, of several pieces, quilted like Mattresses. Some of
them wear onely a hairy skin, having at the waste, instead of a Girdle, a Serpent of brass,
given them by their Doctors, when they make their profession, as a mark of their Learning. It
is the <hi>Suffibaschi,</hi> or chief of the <hi>Suffi</hi> who Consecrates them in the <hi>Sufficane,</hi> at <hi>Ardebil, Ispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi>
and <hi>Meschet.</hi> These <hi>Abdallas</hi> trudge up and down the Markets and other publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to assemble the people, and Preach to them the Miracles of their Saints, and to curse
<hi>Abubeker, Omar, Osman,</hi> and <hi>Hanife,</hi> as also the Saints of the <hi>Vsbeques Tartars,</hi> of whom
they relate ridiculous and obscene stories, to make them abominable and despicable. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
somewhat to the establishment of their Religion, and heightens in the Children the
hatred they have against the <hi>Turks,</hi> for those are the chief Auditors of these Market-Lectures;
and thence it comes, that these <hi>Abdallas</hi> are never seen neer the Frontiers of <hi>Turkey.</hi> There
are some of them, who take whatever their Auditors give them, and thence it comes they are
also termed <hi>Kalanderan;</hi> for after they have spent about half an hour in talking and telling of
stories, much after the manner of our Mountebanks, they have some small money given them,
whereupon they dismiss the assembly, to go and Preach in some other place. They have in
their hand a Hatchet or Scepter of wood, wherewith they make their Gestures, and handle
them, as those in our parts, who shew tricks of Legerdemain, do their sticks. They set out
their Discourse with all sorts of Fables, and sometimes bring in such palpable lies, that some
make no difficulty to interrupt them, and reproach them with their impudence. They are a
lewd sort of people, addicted to all manner of vices. Tipling-houses and places of publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
are their ordinary retreats, and they are for the most part Buggerers and High-way-men.
That they may commit their Robberies with greater safety, they go in the night time into
Caves, and, Counterfeiting the neighing of Horses, they make a discovery of what number
passes by. Hence it comes, that there are few that will give them so much as Lodging, in so
much that they are forc'd to take up their quarters in Chapels, built for that purpose neer the
<hi>Mosqueyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall here relate, to this purpose, what happen'd, at the time of our Embassy, in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of <hi>Lekere,</hi> within three leagues of <hi>Ardebil,</hi> to one of these <hi>Abdallas,</hi> who address'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to a young Woman, desiring her to give him a night's Lodging. The Woman excus'd her
self upon the absence of her Husband, and told him, that, another time when her Husband
were at home, he should not be deny'd. The <hi>Abdalla</hi> finding the young Woman to his mind,
and seeing her go out to milk the Kine, made his advantage of the opportunity, crept into the
house, and hid himself under a bed, which the <hi>Persians,</hi> in the Summer time, put on high
Tressels, as well to prevent the inconvenience they receive from insects, as that they may make
use of the floor to put their Corn upon. The VVoman being return'd from milking, desir'd a
young Maid of the neighbourhood to keep her company that night, and while they were at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
she intreated the Maid, to reach some Cakes she had lay'd upon the bed; which she did,
but finding the <hi>Abdalla</hi> lying under it, and imagining it was with the VVomans consent and
privity that he was come thither, she would stay no longer with her. The <hi>Abdalla</hi> perceiving
the Maid was gone, comes out, salutes the young VVoman, and desires her to Lodge him, and
having obtain'd that, made it his further intreaty, that she would afford him part of her own
bed. The poor Woman finding her self alone, made as if she consented, and told him, she
would onely go into the next Room to get somewhat for his Supper: but as soon as she was got
in, she lock'd the Door, and barricado'd her self in with certain Bags of Rice. The <hi>Abdalla</hi>
finding himself chows'd, lay'd hold of a little Child, and threatned the VVoman to kill it, if
she would not open the Door. The VVoman made answer, that her honour was dearer to her
than her Child, and that her Husband, who would be the most injur'd in its miscarriage, would
get more of them. Upon that the <hi>Abdalla</hi> kill'd the Child with a broad Knife, which these
Villains are wont to carry at their Girdles, and call <hi>Bukdan,</hi> cut him into four quarters, and
beset himself to force open the Door. To get into the Room, he made a hole under the Thres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
of the Door, and thrust himself into it to get through; but ere he had quite pass'd his
head and shoulders, the VVoman cries out; and finding a Plough-share in the Room, gave him
so many strokes over the head and neck therewith, that he dy'd of it. The Neighbours, coming
in at the noise, and, immediately after the Husband, found this sad Spectacle of the <hi>Abdalla,</hi>
and, having got open the Door, the VVoman swounded in the Room. Being come to her self,
she call'd to mind, that the Rogue, finding himself hurt by the first blow she had given him,
had begg'd his life, and told her that he had wherewithall to purchase it: whereupon the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:47786:173"/>
took the pains to search him, and to examine his ragged Coat, which had so many pieces
about it, as made a shift to Lodge eight hundred <hi>Chequines,</hi> whereof the Peasant made his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
The <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s body was burnt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> interr their Dead,<note place="margin">Their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrments.</note> within three hours after the Soul is gone out of the body,
unless it be in the night time. They wash the bodies before they are interr'd, and this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is perform'd, in the house, to persons of quality, or in a place built in the Church-yard
for that purpose, which they call <hi>Mordeschar Cane,</hi> for the common people. I had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to see these Ceremonies at <hi>Caswin,</hi> in our return from <hi>Ispahan.</hi> 'Twas the body of a
young man of about twenty years of age, whom they carried in his Cloaths, and before he
was quite cold, singing all along, to the Church-yard, where they stripp'd him, and cast him
into a Cestern built about with Free-stone, about sixteen foot square. The Grave-maker ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
wash'd the body all over, they put a clean shirt about him, wrapp'd him in a shrowd of
Cotton Cloath, and lay'd him on a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er, to be carry'd to the Grave, which was not far thence.
Persons of quality have this further Ceremony done them, that at their coming out of the Bath,
the body is set upright, and they pour Camphir water, which they call <hi>Kafur,</hi> upon the head,
whence it runs down all over the body, all the Overtures whereof are stopped with Cotton.
Then they lay it near the Grave, and the Priest having read some passages of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> raises
up his head a little, which he presently lets down again, and then he is put into the Grave
without any Coffin. The Graves are made very hollow, and some are vaulted, and others co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with boards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the body is laid down on the right-side, with the face towards the West,
upon this accompt, that the <hi>Persians,</hi> among other things, are of a perswasion, that at the last
Judgement, the Sun and Moon shall be very sad, and that the Sun coming to the West shall
stand still, and that both those Planets shall become as black as Coal. That then the Angel
<hi>Gabriel</hi> shall come and beat the Sun and Moon, and force them to return from the West to the
East, and that the last judgement shall begin at the West. Then the Priest, having taken up a
little earth in his hand, read another passage of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> went seven paces from the Grave,
then return'd to it again, and having read another passage, retir'd with all the company. After
these Ceremonies, persons of quality are wont to make a Feast, the third day after the interr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but without any Wine, and if the deceas'd hath left much Wealth behind him, they
make another Feast on the seventh, and another on the fortieth day, as also at the <hi>Naurus,</hi> at
the <hi>Kurban,</hi> and at the <hi>Ramesan,</hi> being sure to distribute some Almes among the Poor.</p>
                  <p>The reason why they make the Graves so hollow, and stop up all the Overtures of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
is, the belief they are of, that when the Priest goes seven paces from the Grave, two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
named <hi>Nekir</hi> and <hi>Munkir,</hi> come into it, and, if the Overtures were not stopped, might
be incommodated by some uncleanness. They believe, that, during that time, the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
into the body, that she raises it into a sitting posture, that it may give the Angels an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all its Members had done in this World. Then he makes these questions to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd;
<hi>In whom hast thou believ'd?</hi> whereto it answers, In one onely God, my Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Who is thy Prophet?</hi> Mahomet. <hi>Who is thy Iman?</hi> Aaly. If he answers pertinently to
the questions, and can give any account of the use of his Members, there is no doubt made but
he is sav'd, and that the Angels thereupon seize the soul, and absolutely separate it from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
There are only persons of age who are subject to this examination; Children being not
oblig'd to give any account of their Faith.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians,</hi> to shew that <hi>Abathalib, Aly</hi>'s Father, is infallibly sav'd, affirm that he was,
before, named <hi>Emiram,</hi> and that he dy'd before <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Being buried, and the Angels ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ask'd him who was his Prophet, he made answer, it was <hi>Mahomet;</hi> but when they ask'd
him who was his Saint, he was at a loss, and knew not what to say, for he knew not then that
his Son <hi>Aly</hi> should become so great an <hi>Imam.</hi> Whereupon the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> going to <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
bid him send <hi>Aly</hi> to <hi>Abalhalib</hi>'s Sepulchre, and to say to him, Father I am thy <hi>Imam,</hi>
and shall draw thee to me at the day of Judgement: and that thence it comes, they gave <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>
the name of <hi>Abathalib,</hi> that is, the seeking Father, in as much as the Father had sought,
and found his <hi>Imam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The interrments of great Lords and persons of quality are performed with great Pomp, and
the body is accompany'd by a great procession. We made mention, in the fift book of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
of a Gentleman of <hi>Scamachie</hi> who had drunk so much Aquavitae, that he dy'd of it the
next day. The Ceremonies of his interrment were as followeth.</p>
                  <p>In the first place, in the head of the Procession, there marched six men carrying Banners, and
great and long Poles, much like those we had seen at our entrance into that place, with this
difference only, that those at this Funeral were wreath'd. Next marched four Horses, the first
whereof carried the Bow and Arrows of the deceas'd, and the other three some part of his
Cloaths. After these, one of his Menial servants, mounted on an excellent Mule, carry'd his
<hi>Mendil,</hi> or <hi>Turbant.</hi> This man was follow'd by two men, carrying on their heads, certain
Towers, which they call <hi>Nachal,</hi> adorn'd with great Plumes of Feathers, who danc'd and
leap'd to the sound of the Musick, which came after them, and consisted of Tabours, and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:47786:173"/>
basins, which they struck one against another. Between this Musick and the Dancers, there
were carried eight Dishes of Preserves, having each of them a Sugar-Cake in the midst, cover'd
with blue paper, which is the colour of their Mourning, and about every Cake three Wax-Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
lighted. Next marched divers of the <hi>Suffi,</hi> who were distinguish'd from others by their
white <hi>Turbants.</hi> Then follow'd two bands of Musicians, who with all their might sung the
<hi>la illa illaha,</hi> and the <hi>Alla Ekber,</hi> accompanying their cries with such distorted Countenances
and Postures, as <hi>Scaramuzza</hi> himself would be much troubled to imitate. Then follow'd three
young Boyes, having their right shoulder and arm naked, and their foreheads and arms so
scratch'd, that the blood trickled down to the ground. Lastly, there follow'd three men, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
each of them a Tree, whereto they had fasten'd certain red Apples, and the Tresses of hair,
which the said Gentlemans three Wives had either pluck'd or cut off their heads, as also certain
pieces of red and green paper. These went immediately before the body, which was carried by
eight men upon their shoulders; and upon the Bier there was a very fair Garment, lined with
the precious skins of the Buchar-sheep. Behind the Corps there follow'd four men, carrying, in
a very high Chair, a young Lad, who read certain passages of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and the Procession
was clos'd with the Relations and Friends of the deceas'd, who went along with the body to a
certain place of the Citie, where it was to remain, till such time as it should be transferr'd to
<hi>Bagdat,</hi> to be dispos'd near their <hi>Imams.</hi>

conduct us, in our return, through the Province of KILAN, out of this consideration, that
the said Province being one of the best and most fertile of all the Kingdome, it was his pleasure
we should pass through it; as well that we might be eye-witnesses of the riches of it, and give
an account thereof in <hi>Germany,</hi> as that we might find there those conveniences, which we had
not met withall in our coming thither, and which we should hardly light upon elsewhere. But
in regard the Inhabitants of <hi>Kilan</hi> are cruel and barbarous, whereas all the other <hi>Persians</hi> are
civil and obliging, it rais'd an apprehension in some, that the King had given those orders pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to ruine us, and it was reported, that his Majesty, being incens'd against the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<hi>Brugman,</hi> who in several Occurrences had demean'd himself insolently and imprudently,
intended to make those people the instruments of his revenge upon him, and all of us. And this
it had been the more easie for him to do, in that he needed only to awaken the resentments of
the Governours of <hi>Derbent</hi> and <hi>Scamachie,</hi> whom the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> had indiscreetly
affronted at our first passage that way. Most of our people were so prepossess'd with this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,

We left <hi>Ispahan,</hi> on the 21. of <hi>December,</hi> towards the evening. Most of the <hi>English</hi>

way, and accompany us. The <hi>Augustine</hi> Fathers of <hi>Ispahan</hi> and F. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> Prior of <hi>Tistis,</hi>
came thither also, to take their leave of us, and afterwards, <hi>Monsieur Malon,</hi> the most
considerable person among the <hi>French</hi> Merchants, came also to make us his Complements.
Monsieur <hi>Mandelflo</hi> came also to the said place, as well to take his final leave of us, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us, that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> had appointed <hi>Imanculi Sulthan, Eischickagasi,</hi> or one of
his Stewards, for the Embassy he intended to send to his Highness the Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> our
Master; that he carried along with him a Present amounting to five and twenty thousand
Crowns, and that he was taking his leave, in order to his departure from the Court, within
a few dayes after.</p>
                  <p>The 23. after we had taken leave of our friends, not without the shedding of some tears, we
got on hori-back, and reach'd that day to the <hi>Caravansera</hi> of <hi>Dombi,</hi> five leagues from our
former lodging.</p>
                  <p>The next day, we got five leagues further, and took up our lodging at night in a <hi>Caravansera,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The 25. being <hi>Christmas</hi>-day, we saw, neer the Village of <hi>Kaskabath,</hi> within two leagues
of <hi>Serdehe,</hi> how the King was encamped there under several Tents, which being of divers
colours, made a very delightfull show. The Ambassadors sent thither the Sieur <hi>Francis Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rher,</hi>

three degrees above the Horizon, when the Moon depriv'd us almost of all sight of it, and so
overshadow'd it, that, to my judgement, in the greatest obscurity, the eclipse was three parts
of four.</p>

<hi>Kim keder kelmes,</hi> that is, those who go it up come not down; an equivocation

Journals,<note place="margin">1638.</note> that the said Mountain is so dangerous, that such as go up it, never come down
again. Whereas the true meaning of those words is onely this, that they who go up that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
come not down, that is, that as long as they are getting up they do not come down,
in as much as both cannot be done at the same time. The <hi>Persians</hi> affirm indeed, that <hi>Schach-Abas</hi>
one day commanded one of his Hunts-men to go up to the top of it, and that he did so,

he would hardly ever be his own man again. But indeed we had all a sad day's journey of it, in
regard most of our horses tir'd, nay, mine falling down dead under me, I was forc'd to make
use of my man's, who went afoot, and carried the Portmantle upon his head. We lodg'd that

a great many Women, who had made a shift to unload the beast, but finding themselves

                     <p>As soon as we were lodg'd in this <hi>Caravansera,</hi> the Ambassador <hi>Crusius</hi> gave order for the

leave of us, he discover'd himself to be a <hi>German.</hi> He told us, among other things, that the
King his Master had given him a Retinue of 200. persons, but that the great Duke of <hi>Muscovy</hi>
would not permit him to pass with so many: which had occasion'd him to stay six moneths at

                     <p>We saw that day, on our right hand, a very fair Countrey-house, which the King had built
upon the Hill call'd <hi>Kultcbe,</hi> for the convenience of hunting. We intended to lodge the next
night at the Village of <hi>Araseng,</hi> and to travel that day but six leagues, but the Inhabitants
told the Harbinger whom the <hi>Mehemandar</hi> had sent thither, to take up Quarters, that they
would not receive us, and that if we attempted to lodge there by force, they were able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it, and make us repent our rashness, not dissembling the design they had, to cut all our
Throats, if we came within the Village, They had not forgotten the affront which the <hi>Kaucha,</hi>
or Judge of the Village, had receiv'd, at our first passage that way, from the Ambassador
<hi>Brugman,</hi> who having desir'd water to wash his hands, and the poor man having brought him
troubled water such as the Brook did afford, cast it in his face, and the pot at his head; so that
we were forc'd to travel on. The Villages of <hi>Dowlet, Abath,</hi> and <hi>Ketzisan,</hi> taking example by
that of <hi>Araseng,</hi> in like manner deny'd us entertainment, and forc'd us to travel on three leagues
further, to the Village of <hi>Kulluskur,</hi> through such a bad and slippery way, that most of
our Horses were several times on their Noses, nay, it was day ere some got to the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>I was lodg'd at the Parson's of the Parish, and sent several times to desire him to come in and

rode on were so tir'd, that most of our people were forc'd to march afoot. Nay some were not

with the Tooth-ach touch the aking Tooth with a Nail or Pebble, which they fasten to
the Tree as high as they can reach with their mouths, and hope by that means to get ease. They,
whose imagination is so strong as to be ever the better by this kind of Cure, express their
acknowledgement thereof by tying certain Ribbands to the boughs of the Tree; though in other
respects these Miracles are not done <hi>gratis,</hi> but are very beneficial to a certain Religious man,
who hath the keeping of the Tree, and makes his advantage of the Offerings and Alms made
there. This profit, which is enough to maintain one man, hath encourag'd several Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks

Hills, manur'd and sowen, and lodg'd, at night, in the Village of <hi>Achibaba,</hi> at the foot of
a Mountain, on our right hand.</p>
                     <p>We were told, that Village was so call'd from an antient man of that name, who liv'd in the
time of <hi>Schich-Sefi,</hi> and obtain'd it of him, in memory of a Miracle which God had done in
his person, in reviving in him and his Wife, who were each of them neer a hundred years of
age, the heat of younger years, in so much that they had a Son, who had bestow'd on them
the Tomb, which they shew'd us, under a great Vault.</p>
                     <p>The 21. we pass'd through a fruitfull Country but somewhat uneven, to the Village of <hi>Tzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telly,</hi>
by some called <hi>Kellabath,</hi> that is, a place fit for the breeding of Cattel; so far as that
the Grass, which there is excellent good, and grows very plentifully, invites the Inhabitants
of <hi>Caswin</hi> to drive their Heards into those parts. The <hi>Vice-Daruga</hi> of <hi>Caswin,</hi> who accompany'd
the Ambassadors to this place, and Supp'd with them, entertain'd them a long time, and much
to their Diversion, with the relation of his life, and told them, he had been carried away in
his Infancy out of <hi>Georgia,</hi> which was his Countrey, in the time of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> during
the War he made in those parts, and that he had been transferr'd to <hi>Caswin</hi> with his Father
and Mother, who were then alive, and still <hi>Christians,</hi> though, in appearance, forc'd to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Religion of the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He told us also, that <hi>Abasculi</hi> made his advantage of our journey, as well as other <hi>Mehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandars,</hi>
to exact Provisions and other conveniences from the places which lay in their way;
but that there was not one half employ'd for the service of the Ambassadors. They made him a
Present of certain Ells of Cloath and Satin.</p>
                     <p>The 22. we travell'd seven leagues, all over Mountains and Rocks, interwoven with a Brook,
which thereabouts ran winding up and down, so as that we were forc'd to cross it above thirty
times, ere we got to the Village of <hi>Kurtzibaschi,</hi> where we lodg'd that night. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we travell'd all along Mountains, which were not very high, but delighted the eye by a
diversity of colours, Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue, which afforded a very pleasant prospect.
But about noon, we could see nothing but Rocks, dreadfull for their height and steepiness, and,
in the evening, we came to the River <hi>Senderuth,</hi> which we cross'd by a Bridge, that joyns the
two Mountains through which it runs. We discover'd from the top of the Mountain, some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and fruitfull Valleys, at least if I may so call the other lower Mountains, which are till'd
and cultivated, and appear'd to us from the top of the Mountain as little Hillocks. This Village
belong'd heretofore to a <hi>Kurtzibaschi,</hi> or Colonel of a thousand Horse, who gave it his own
name, and was seated in a very pleasant place: but the houses were built onely of Earth and
Canes, whereto there adjoyned certain shepheards Huts, where with we made the best shift we
could.</p>
                     <p>The 23. we travell'd two leagues, very good way, along a Forest of Olive-Trees, at the
end whereof, we came to a place, antiently called <hi>Fauces Hyrcaniae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fauces Hyrcaniae.</note> but by the <hi>Persians,</hi> in
the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, as it is indeed to this day, <hi>Pylas.</hi> The passage is very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and serves for a Gate to the Province of <hi>Kilan.</hi> At the entrance of it, joyn two swift
Rivers, which fall down with a dreadfull noyse through the Rocks, under the name of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Isperuth,</hi> though before their joyning together, the greater of the two had the name <hi>Kisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losein,</hi>
                        <pb n="288" facs="tcp:47786:176"/>
and passing under a stone bridge, in order to its falling into the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> it
there again divides it self, and by two several Chanels, falls into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea.</p>
                     <p>This is a very fair Bridge,<note place="margin">A <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vansera</hi> upon a Bridge.</note> built on six Arches, each whereof hath a spacious Room, a Kitchin,
and several other conveniences, lying even with the water. The going down into it is by a stone
pair of stairs; so that this Bridge is able to find entertainment for a whole <hi>Caravanne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the end of the Bridge,<note place="margin">A Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Road.</note> the road divides it self. One way leads through a delightful and
even Countrey, into the Province of <hi>Chalcal,</hi> and so to <hi>Ardebil,</hi> the other goes streight into
the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> and this last is the most dangerous and most dreadfull way of any, I
think, in the World. It is cut out of a Mountain which is pure Rock, and so steepy, that
they found it a hard matter to make way enough for the passage of one Horse or Camel loaden,
nay, in some places they have been forc'd to supply it with Mason's work, where the Rock fell
short.</p>
                     <p>On the left hand, the Rock reach'd up into the Clouds, so as that the top of it could not be
seen; and on the right, there was a dreadfull Abyss, wherein the River made its passage, with
a noyse, which no less stunn'd the ear, than the Precipices dazzled the eye, and made the head
turn. Not one among us, nor indeed of the <hi>Persians</hi> themselves, durst ride it up, but were
forc'd to lead their Horses by the Bridle, and that at a distance loosely, lest the beast, falling,
might drag his Master after him. The Horses came very gingerly, but the Camels stumbled
not at all, and were sure to set their feet in the steps, which had been purposely cut for them in
the Rock. At the top of the Mountain, we came to a house, where certain duties are paid.
The Receiver thereof made us a Present of several fruits, and we wondred much, considering
the time of the year, to see the Hedges all over the Valleys, flourishing, and full of blossoms.</p>
                     <p>But this very Mountain,<note place="margin">Summer and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same day.</note> which was so steepy, teadious, and dreadfull on the one side, had
so pleasant and delightfull a descent on the other, that it was no hard matter for us to forget the
fright and trouble we had been in, in coming it up. It was all over clad with a resplendent ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
and so planted with Citron-Trees, Orenge-Trees, Olive-Trees, nay, Cypress-Trees,
and Box, that there is not any Garden in <hi>Europe</hi> could more delight the eye, nor more surprise
and divert the smell. The ground was in a manner cover'd with Citrons and Orenges, insomuch
that some of our people, who had never seen such abundance of them, made it their sport to
fling them at one another's heads. But what we were most astonish'd at, was, in one and the
same day, to see Winter chang'd to Summer, and the cold, which we had been sufficiently sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of in the morning, turn'd to a heat, which in a manner accompany'd us into <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We lodg'd that night, at the foot of a Mountain, upon the River <hi>Isperuth,</hi> at the Village
of <hi>Pyle-rubar.</hi> 'Tis true the houses were little and incommodious, and scatter'd up and down
without any order; but there was not any but had its Garden, and Vineyard, its Citron-trees,
Orenge-trees, and Pomegranate-trees, and that in such abundance, that the Village being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
therewith, we could hardly see any of the houses. It was encompass'd of all sides with
a very high Mountain, save only, that on the South-west side of the Valley, there was a little
Plain.</p>
                     <p>It may be said of this part, as indeed of all the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence of <hi>Kilan</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> that it is a kind of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Paradice. In the fifth Book of these Travels, we gave an account of its extent, of the
other Provinces whereof it consisted, and of its principal Cities; whereto we think fit to add in
this place, that the Province of <hi>Kilan</hi> extends it self like a Crescent, all along the Caspian Sea,
and that it is encompass'd like a Theatre, with a high Mountain, out of which arise several Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
which refresh the plain Country, and make it very fruitfull, but in some places, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
towards the Sea, so fenny, that the whole Province becomes by that means inaccessible. But
<hi>Schach-Abas</hi> hath remedied that inconvenience, by a bank or causey, which runs quite through
the Country, from <hi>Astarabath</hi> to <hi>Aastra;</hi> so that now people may travel without any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
and that with any kind of Carriage, Horse, Camels, Wagons, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>There is no Province of all <hi>Persia</hi> so fertile and so abundant with Silk, Oyl, Wine, Rice,
Tobacco, Lemons, Orenges, Pomegranates, and other Fruits.<note place="margin">Its Fruits.</note> The Vines there are excellent,
and as big as a man at the Waste: but in regard they are commonly planted at the foot of some
tree, the branches spread themselves up the tree, even to the extremities of the boughs, so that
the Vintage becomes so much the more difficult. For he who is to gather the Grapes, is oblig'd
to fasten to the top of the tree a rope, having at the other end a stick as if it were to swing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
upon which he having seated himself, is drawn and swings as it were from one tree to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and from one bough to another, to gather the bunches.</p>
                     <p>The Mountain which encompasses it and spreads its extremities to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea-side,
is so cover'd with trees, that the whole Province seems to be enclos'd by a continued
Forest.</p>
                     <p>The neighbouring Sea, and all the Rivers of this Province are so well stor'd with Fish, the
grounds with Cattel, and the forests with all sorts of Venison and wild Fowl, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
have not only wherewithall to live deliciously themselves, but may communicate of their
abundance to their Neighbours. Which is contrary to what <hi>Iohn de Laet,</hi> writes, after <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>

                        <hi>de Persia,</hi> to wit, that <hi>Mesanderan,</hi> which is part of the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> is so cold a
Country, that the fruits thereof hardly come to their full maturity. We know by experience,
that there is no Province in all <hi>Persia,</hi> where the air is better and more temperate than in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanderan,</hi>
and that it produces the best and fairest Fruits of any place in the Kingdom. Whence
it came, that <hi>Schach Abas,</hi> who knew it very well, preferr'd this Province before all the rest
of the Kingdom, and had such a kindness for it, that, willing to make it his ordinary residence,
he there built the City of <hi>Terabath,</hi> where he died.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of this Province,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The</hi> Kilek.</note> especially the <hi>Kilek</hi> who live between <hi>Kesker</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanderan,</hi>
are self-conceited, hardy and apt to attempt any thing. They had heretofore their
particular King, nay even to this day, the King of <hi>Persia</hi> is not so absolute there, as in the
other Provinces of his Kingdom; as well in regard they need not much care for any Trading
with their Neighbours, since they have at home whatever is necessary, as that the Countrey
being in a manner inaccessible, they may easily avoid entertaining the Forces which might be
quarter'd upon them. There are but four wayes to come into the Province, and all very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
the first comes from <hi>Chorasan</hi>-side, by the way of <hi>Astarabath;</hi> the second, from <hi>Mesan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daran,</hi>
by the way of <hi>Ferabath;</hi> the third, by <hi>Pyle-rubar,</hi> and the fourth, by <hi>Lenger
Kunan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All these waies are so narrow, that they hardly afford passage for a Camel. Such as are
afoot, as also horse-men, sometimes venture to get into it by the way of the Mountain; but
the way there also is so intricate, that the passages being maintainable by a few people, and the
<hi>Caspian</hi> Sea not being able to bear great ships, the Inhabitants have no enemies to fear but the
<hi>Cosaques,</hi> who sometimes fall into the Country in the night, to surprise and rifle certain Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
upon the Sea-side.</p>
                     <p>We were then told,<note place="margin">Revolt.</note> that it was not above eight and thirty years, since <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united

the <hi>Kilek,</hi> finding that <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi> his Successor, signaliz'd the initials of his Reign by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions

King's money, as he also did in all the other Cities of the Province, whereof he had possess'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of all the avenues. The King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who was then at <hi>Caswin,</hi> coming to hear of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
by the other Governours of the Country, Commanded <hi>Saru, Chan</hi> of <hi>Astara, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

<hi>Adam, Sultan</hi> of <hi>Mesanderan,</hi> to set upon <hi>Karib-Schach</hi> of all sides. To that end they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their forces into three Bodies, and went with two of them streight towards him, intending
to make use of the third, in case of necessity, as a reserve; but they found him so well posted,
that they were forc'd to retreat with loss.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Karib-Schach,</hi> instead of improving this first advantage, which might have given reputation
to his Arms, grew so insolent thereupon, and withall so negligent, that he permitted his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to enlarge their quarters to the adjacent Villages, where they fell to merriment and making
good cheer, while he continued with some few about him at <hi>Kisma</hi> and <hi>Fumen.</hi> The <hi>Chans</hi>
who observ'd all his actions, had no sooner notice of it, but they got together again their three
Bodies, which made an Army of above 40000. men, with which they set upon the forces of
<hi>Karib-Schach</hi> in their quarters, and gave them an absolute defeat.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Karib</hi> himself, he had the time to get into a Garden, where he hid himself, behind one
of those trees which produce silk, and which those of the Countrey call <hi>Tut;</hi> but he was there
discover'd by one of the Domesticks of <hi>Emir-Chan,</hi> who knew him by his Cloaths. He intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>Thebni,</hi> or Servant, to save his life, by furnishing him with his Cloaths, and promis'd
him, in requital, a good sum of mony, besides the Present he made him in hand of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Jewels. The Servant made as if he consented, but assoon as he got on <hi>Karib</hi>'s Garment and
Sword, he said to him, It is I who am now King, and thou art but a Traytor, and thereupon
calling to some of his Camerades, he seiz'd upon him, and put him into the <hi>Palenk. Schach-Sefi</hi>
would needs see him, and had him brought to <hi>Caswin,</hi> where he then was, making his entrance
into it, accompany'd by five or six hundred Curtezans, who incessantly jeer'd him in his
Royalty, and did him a thousand indignities and affronts.</p>

accustom'd to go upon the fat and soft ground of <hi>Kilan,</hi> he would otherwise hardly endure the
stony and rugged wayes of <hi>Persia.</hi> Having suffer'd him to languish in that condition three dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they brought him to the <hi>Maidan,</hi> where they set him on the top of a Pole, and kill'd him with
Arrows. The King having shot the first, oblig'd all the Lords of the Court to follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
bidding those that lov'd him do as he had done. Upon that word, he was immediately
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:47786:179"/>
so cover'd with Arrows, that there was no shape of a man to be seen. The body was left
in that posture three dayes, expos'd to the sight of all, and then it was taken thence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd.</p>

                        <hi>Saru Chan,</hi> Governour of <hi>Astara,</hi> had express'd most zeal, courage, and conduct in that
War, whereby he got so much into favour with <hi>Schach-Sesi,</hi> that the sav'd the estate and life
of a rich Merchant, who was unfortunately engag'd in <hi>Karib</hi>'s revolt. He liv'd at the Village
of <hi>Leschtensa,</hi> and if he did not openly declare for <hi>Karib,</hi> certain it is, he knew of his design,
and neglected to give norice of it to the Court: so that they were going to extirpate him and
his family, and to confiscate his Estate, which amounted to above a hundred thousand pounds
<hi>sterl,</hi> to the King's use, had not <hi>Saru-Chan</hi>'s intercession procur'd his pardon.</p>
                     <p>Assoon as this revolt was appeas'd,<note place="margin">The Kilek <hi>disarm'd.</hi>
                        </note> the <hi>Kilek</hi> were dis-arm'd, and they were forbidden to
buy Arms, upon so great penalties, that ever since that time they have not dar'd to have any,
not so much as a <hi>Sefir,</hi> or Ring, wherewith the <hi>Persians</hi> bend their Bows, so far were they
from being allow'd Fire-arms, Swords, Bows or Arrows. They are only permitted the use

                           <hi>The</hi> Talisch</note> The Women of the <hi>Talisch</hi>'s are the handsomest of any in <hi>Persia,</hi> and cover
not their faces as much as the others do. Maids have their hair ty'd up in 24. or 25. tresses,
which hang down over their backs and shoulders, but married Women have but ten or twelve.
Their Garments are so short before, that they hide not their Smocks, and instead of shoes,
they were Sandals of wood, which they fasten with a string to the heel, and, with a button
or latchet of wood, between the great toe and the next to it: but in regard the ground is very
fat there upon any rain, they commonly go bare-foot as well as the men. The Caps worn by
the <hi>Kileck</hi> are of a coarse Cloath, but those of the <hi>Talisch</hi> are of black Lambskin. These two
people have each of them their particular Language, which differs from the <hi>Persian,</hi> only as
to Dialect; though there be so little rapport between that of <hi>Kilan</hi> and that of the <hi>Talisch,</hi> that
they have much ado to understand one the other. For example, to signify a Dog, a <hi>Persian</hi> will
say <hi>Sek,</hi> a <hi>Kilek Seggi,</hi> and a <hi>Talisch Spech.</hi> There is no Province in all <hi>Persia,</hi> where the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

                        </hi> They are commonly employ'd in spinning,
and making Stuffs of Cotton, Flax, and Silk, as also in making <hi>Duschab,</hi> and Syrrop of
Wine, which they sell by jarrs, and tilling the ground for the sowing of Rice, about which
the men and women have their several employments. For the men hold the Plow, and make
the trenches to keep in the water, for the watering of the ground: The women carry the Corn
to field. The men sow the ground, going backwards as they cast the seed into it: The women
weed it. The men cut it, and the women bind it. The men bring it into the barn, but
the women thrash and sell it. They all profess the <hi>Turkish</hi> Religion, and are of the Sect of
<hi>Hanife.</hi>

                     <p>They receiv'd us so kindly, that it was generally wish'd by us we might have made some stay
there: but we were forc'd to depart thence the 24. of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> We went, at first, along the
River side, having on our left hand a forest of Olive-trees, which gave us a pleasant shade, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the heat of the Sun, which prov'd very great that day. Within a league of <hi>Pyle-rubar,</hi>
we saw, in the midst of the River, upon a great Rock, the ruins of a Castle, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of a Bridge, both which they said had been pull'd down by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. We
afterwards pass'd over another Mountain, or rather a very high and craggy Rock, at the foot
whereof we came into a very smooth way, enamell'd with green, and spread over with new
springing grass, checquer'd with Violets, which extremely delighted not only the smell but also
the eye. We came at night to a Village, where we saw the Sepulchre of <hi>Iman Sade,</hi> in a little
Chapel built at the foot of a hill, which lay on our right hand. All the houses of the Village
were cover'd with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

seems, are more frequent in those parts than any where else.</p>
                     <p>The 25. we got five leagues,<note place="margin">Come to <hi>Rescht.</hi>
                        </note> and came at night to <hi>Rescht.</hi> The way at first, was somewhat
uneven and wooddy: but after a while, we found it planted with those trees which bear silk,
and at last we came to a plain and smooth way, having on both sides Corn-grounds, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
with several deep trenches, such as those which in <hi>Flanders</hi> they call <hi>Water-gangs,</hi> into
which they let in the water by Sluces, and there keep it, for the watering of their grounds,
when the heat hath dry'd up the sources of the Rivers, nay indeed for the overflowing of them,
when need requires. They had indeed been at the pains to make Bridges over those moats or
trenches, but they were so ill kept in repair, that many of our people fell into the water. The
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:47786:179"/>
Inhabitants of the Country mind only the husbandry of Rice, and they have each of them his
house at the end of his piece of ground, about two or three hundred paces distant one from the
other.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Rescht</hi> is the Metropolis of all <hi>Kilan,</hi>

                        </note> and of a considerable bigness, but open
of all sides like a Village, and the houses of it are so hid within the trees, that a man at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into it may think, he is rather going into a Forest than a City, since there is no seeing
of it, till a man be within it. It lies two leagues distant from the <hi>Caspain</hi> Sea, and the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi>
in the Catalogue of their Cities, name it, <hi>Husum,</hi> and place it at 85. degrees, 10.
minutes latitude. The houses of it are not so well built, nor so fair, as those of the other Cities
of <hi>Persia,</hi> but they were all cover'd with tiles as ours, and not any but had adjoyning thereto
a great number of Citron-trees and Orenge-trees, which had then on them their second fruit,
ripe, of that years growth.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Maidan,</hi> or Market-place, is very spacious, and full of shops, where are sold all sorts
of Commodities, especially Provisions, which are very cheap there, upon which accompt it
was, that our <hi>Mehemander</hi> treated us very magnificently during the aboad we made there,
which was five daies: The City of <hi>Rescht,</hi> though the greatest af all the Province, hath
no <hi>Chan,</hi> or chief Governour, but only a <hi>Daruga,</hi> whose name, at that time, was <hi>Alyculi-Beg.</hi>

                        <hi>Ian.</hi> 26. the Inhabitants of <hi>Rescht</hi> celebrated a Festival,<note place="margin">A feast in honour of <hi>Aly.</hi>
                        </note> in Honour of <hi>Aly,</hi> with the same
Ceremonies in a manner, as we had seen at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> on the 7. of <hi>February,</hi> the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
and this Feast happen'd then in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in regard the <hi>Persians</hi> regulate their Feasts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Moon. They borrow'd of us a Drum, wherewith they made a mad kind of noise
in their Procession. The Preacher, who made a long relation of the Miracles of <hi>Aly,</hi> concluded
his Sermon with these blasphemous words, That, if <hi>Aly</hi> were not really God, he at least
came very neer the Divinity: <hi>Aly Chodda nist, amma ne dures Choddai.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We were here shewn the Sanctuary,<note place="margin">Sefi <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zas</hi>' San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</note> which <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> had ordered to be built, at the place,

which brought us not only to our lodging that night, but also to the Frontiers of the Province
of <hi>Kilan,</hi> which is very even on that side. All the way was planted on both sides with Box,
and those trees which bear silk, and cross'd by many small Rivers, whereof such as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
enough to have a name, are, the <hi>Pesi-chan,</hi> half a league from the City of <hi>Rescht,</hi>
then that of <hi>Chettiban,</hi> and somewhat less than a league thence, those of <hi>Pischeru</hi> and <hi>Lissar,</hi>
all which have Bridges, rais'd very high, by reason of the frequent inundations of the Rivers,
and so untoward to pass over, that they put a man into a fright: and notwithstanding all our
care, yet could we not prevent the Horse, which carried the Physicians baggage, from falling
into the River, whence we had much ado to get him out, by reason of the Fens on both sides
it. The last River we cross'd that day is called <hi>Tzomus;</hi> and they are all well stor'd with fish,
in so much that the King farms out the fishing of them, which brings him in yearly very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
sums. Having travell'd four leagues that day, we came at night to <hi>Kisma,</hi> neet the
Town of <hi>Fumen,</hi> or <hi>Pumen,</hi> where <hi>Karib-schach</hi> was defeated, and taken, as we related
before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ianuary</hi> the last, we got four leagues further, our way being planted all along with those
Trees which bear silk, and whereof there was so great a number, that they made a Forest.
We saw also that day great Vineyards, according to the <hi>Persian</hi> way.</p>
                     <p>Having travell'd about four leagues, we met with the <hi>Calenter,</hi> or King's Lieutenant in the
Government of <hi>Kesker,</hi> who came to meet us, accompany'd by thirty Horse. He had led after
him a Mule, loaden with Wine, Conserves, and other refreshments, wherewith he treated
the Ambassadors, and oblig'd them to make a Collation in the field.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chan,</hi> who was coming after him,<note place="margin">Come to <hi>Kurab.</hi>
                        </note> accompany'd by a hundred persons of quality on
Hors-back, receiv'd the Ambassadors with great civility, and conducted us to the little Citie
of <hi>Kurab,</hi> where he invited us to his own house, and treated us with Fruit and Conserves,
making it his excuse, that their Fast permitted him not to keep us company, and entertain us
with flesh. The Collation ended, he had us all conducted to the Lodgings he had taken up for
us, ordered certain Gentlemen to wait on the Ambassadors, and sent them a Present of four
wild Boars.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chan</hi>'s name was <hi>Emir,</hi> and he was son to a <hi>Georgian Christian,</hi> born at a Village neer
<hi>Eruan.</hi> He had been Circumcis'd in his youth, and had some time been <hi>Cup-bearer</hi> to <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi>
who had bestow'd that Government on him, in recompence of the service he had done
him at the siege of <hi>Eruan,</hi> and had given the reversion of his place of <hi>Cup-bearer</hi> to his Son. He
was an eloquent person, and obliging, and took much delight in talking of the Affairs and
Wars of <hi>Germany,</hi> and our manner of life. He told us he could not forbear loving the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:</hi>
but we were told one very extraordinary thing of him, and horrid to relate, to wit,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47786:180"/>
that having some time been in a teadious Disease, which having caus'd an universal contraction
in all his Members, the Physicians had order'd him one of the most extravagant remedies that
ever were heard of, which was, <hi>ut rem haberet cum cane foemina.</hi>

                        </note> as that of <hi>Rescht</hi> do's,
and is hid within its Trees. They who call it <hi>Kesker,</hi> give it the name of the Province, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it lies. In this place was born <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi> who reign'd at the time of our Embassy. For
his Mother was brought to bed in this Citie, upon occasion of a journey which <hi>Schach-Abas</hi>
took into <hi>Kilan,</hi> wherein she follow'd him, along with <hi>Sesi Mersa</hi> her Husband. The house,
wherein he was born, belong'd to a rich Merchant, named <hi>Chotza Mahmud;</hi> but in regard
a Prince, Heir to the Crown, had his birth there, it was converted into a Sanctuary.</p>

                        </note> about ten in the morning, having very fair weather,
save that the heat was greater than we could have wish'd. <hi>Emir-Chan</hi> conducted us a league
or better out of the Citie, where he took leave, intreating us to be carefull of his <hi>Calenter,</hi>
who had order to accompany us through his Government. This <hi>Calenter</hi> was a young man, of
an excellent good nature, and diverted us in our way, by shooting with the Bow, and shewing
tricks with a half-pike, at which exercise he had an admirable sleight.</p>
                     <p>Having travell'd two leagues, we were got to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea-side, whence we saw the
Countrey, which is all cover'd with Trees and Forests towards the North and South, sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                           </gap>ra.</hi> We travell'd about a league along the
the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea-side, and lodg'd at night, upon the Torrent <hi>Nasseru,</hi> in a house calld <hi>Ruas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seru-kura,</hi>
which had but two Chambers in all, so that being streightned for room, most of
our people were forc'd to ly abroad, at the sign of the <hi>Seven-Stars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 2. we travell'd six leagues or better, along the Sea coast, going North-westward. We
cross'd over that day fourteen little Rivers, or rather so many great brooks, and among others,
those of <hi>Sehibern, Dinatsar, Chalessera, Alarus;</hi> and <hi>Nabarrus.</hi> The River of <hi>Dinatsar,</hi>
which is about the mid-way, serves for a common Frontier to the Goverments of <hi>Kesker</hi> and
<hi>Astara,</hi> which oblig'd the <hi>Calenter</hi> of <hi>Kesker,</hi> who had accompany'd us so far, to take leave,
and recommend us to the conduct of the <hi>Calenter</hi> of <hi>Astara,</hi> who waited for us on the River
side. The Canton is called <hi>Kargaru.</hi> The <hi>Calenter</hi> carried us out of the highway, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
us through Corn-ground to a Village named <hi>Sengar-hasara,</hi> where we lodg'd that night,
and found, brought thither, before us, five wild boars which they had hunted, purely upon
our accompt, and for our entertainment. All the Forests of those parts are well stor'd with
them, in regard the <hi>Persians,</hi> not daring to eat them, are not much inclin'd to the hunting of
them.</p>
                     <p>The 3. we departed betimes in the morning, in snowy and rainy weather, and continu'd
our way along the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, drawing towards East-north-east. Our way lay so neer the
Sea, that the Horses many times went into the water up to the Girts, nay some of our people
fell, horse and man, into the water: so that this prov'd one of the worst dayes journey we had,
especially for this, that, after we had travell'd seven large leagues, we were forc'd to lodge
that night in a wretched Village, named <hi>Hove-lemur,</hi> where all we could get was only a house
over our heads.</p>
                     <p>The 4. we were upon our way again very betimes in the morning, having receiv'd fresh hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
We travell'd four leagues along the Sea-coast, going towards the North. Then we pass'd
through a Forest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of two leagues, and, in that space of ground, met with two and twenty
Rivers; whereof the chiefest are called <hi>Lome, Konab,</hi> and <hi>Beskeschan.</hi> The Bridges we were
to pass over, were so bad, that many of our company fell into the water, nay there were three
Peasants and four horses drown'd, and six more died by the way.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Astara,</hi> with a troop of 200. horse, met us within half a league of the Village,
where we were to take up our quarters, and accompany'd the Ambassadors to their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which he had taken up for them in houses scatter'd up and down among the trees. The
name of the Village, as also of the River, which runs through it, is <hi>Choskedehene.</hi> The word
<hi>Choskedehene</hi> signifies, dry-mouth, and they have given it that name, for this reason, that,
the Sea is so shallow there, that the Fish cannot get into the River. The <hi>Chan</hi> lives at <hi>Astara,</hi>
which place hath its name from the Province, and is an open place without any walls, as <hi>Rescht</hi>
is, within a quarter of a league of the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. His name was <hi>Saru-Chan,</hi> a person furnish'd
with all the qualities requisite in a Governour of a Province.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. which was the last day of their Lent, he made a great entertainment for the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors,
whereat he discover'd not only the magnificence of his disposition, but also the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of his wit, by the noble discourses that pass'd between him and the Ambassadours.
Among other things, he gave them all the particulars of the War, occasion'd by <hi>Karib-Sehach</hi>'s
revolt, wherein he had been in person, and had brought away his table-cloath, which, being
of green Satin with Gold-flowers, was laid at this entertainment. That service, with other he
had done upon several other occasions, had rais'd him so much into the King's favour, that he
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47786:180"/>
had appointed him for the Embassy into the <hi>Indies,</hi> whither he was to go the following Spring,
to which end he had already received his dispatches. He confirm'd to us what we had been told
before, of the danger we might fear from the <hi>Cosaques,</hi> adding thereto, that it was not two
years since they had plunder'd the City of <hi>Rescht,</hi> and that it were not amiss we stood on our
guard, and had our Arms fixt.</p>
                     <p>The Vines in these parts are so big, that they exceed a man's bulk. I have said as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though I believe some will hardly believe it: but besides that all who travell'd with us,
are eye-witnesses of this truth, I may allege, to make good what I affirm, the Authority of
<hi>Strabo,</hi> who saies the same thing of the Vines of <hi>Margiana,</hi> which is part of the Province of
<hi>Chorasan,</hi> and adds thereto, that no stock almost but yields an ordinary pail-full of Wine;
which is very certain, and yet I have some reason to doubt of what he further affirms, that the

passage, into the Province of <hi>Lengerkunan.</hi> The only way to come into it is by a Bank, rais'd
between the mountains and the fenns, besides which there is no other passage. At the end of the
said bank, we came to the River <hi>Serdane,</hi> and afterwards to the Town of <hi>Lenkeran;</hi> upon the
River <hi>Warsasaruth.</hi> This Town, as also all the adjacent Country, derives its name from the
easy anchorage of shipping thereabouts, though, to speak rigorously, there is no haven in
those parts, but only a kind of Bay, between two Capes, or Promontories, which reach a
great way into the Sea, one on <hi>Lenkeran</hi>-side, which is cover'd with trees, on the other on
<hi>Kisilagats</hi>-side, on which there is nothing but canes. But the Sea thereabout is so shallow, that
little Vessels can hardly get in there; and when they are in, they ly exposs'd to the violence
of the East-wind.</p>

that place by Sea an Ambassador from <hi>Rudolph II.</hi> Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and that he died
there with most of his retinue: but the Inhabitants thereabouts, from whom I would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd

the Countrey allow'd him as part of his pay; though our <hi>Mehemandar</hi> and the <hi>Persians,</hi> for
what reasons I know not, would have perswaded us, that it belong'd to the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Ardebil,</hi>
and depended on his Government. We were receiv'd there by a <hi>Visir,</hi> or Secretary, who had
the over-sight of the Demesn in those parts.</p>
                     <p>We continu'd there the 8. 9. and 10. as well to refresh the Camels, which the ill and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery

were not yet come up with the baggage, and with them fresh horses, for the better prosecution
of our Journey.</p>
                     <p>The 11. we left <hi>Lenkeran,</hi>

great Rivers, to wit, those of <hi>Kasiende, Noabine, Tzili,</hi> and <hi>Buladi,</hi> the three former over
Bridges, and the last, which was very broad, in little Boats, swimming over the horses. At
our coming out of the River, we were forc'd to travel with much inconvenience, for half a
league or better, through the water, which the adjacent Sea had forc'd up there, and to send the
Baggage by Sea, in six great Fisher-boats. The Sea-side, in those parts, is cover'd all over with
Canes, as are also the Islands along the Coast, where the <hi>Cosaques</hi> some times lye in ambush,
to surprize and set upon the ships which pass that way, as also in expectation of an opportunity
to cross over to the Continent.</p>

was excellent Pasture for Cattel. I conceive this to be the place which <hi>Strabo</hi> speaks of, when
he says, that, towards the <hi>Portae Caspiae,</hi> there is a fertile plain, very fit for the breeding of
Horses. He adds, that it is able to keep fifty thousand breeding Mares, which number the
Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> were wont to have kept there. But this is not true, at least there is no such thing
now: though a Military Officer of the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi>'s, who made it his bragg, that he had
travell'd into <hi>Tartary,</hi> though he had not been beyond <hi>Astrachan,</hi> being question'd concerning
the truth of this breeding-place, had the confidence to affirm, that what <hi>Strabo</hi> had said of it,

the Sister. <hi>Schach Abas</hi> coming to hear of it, ordered all the Inhabitants of the Village, to be
cut to pieces, without any regard or distinction of age or sex, and peopled it with others. I
conceive, it is of the Inhabitants of these parts, that we are to understand what <hi>Herodotus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
of their going together, without any shame, and publickly, after the manner of Beasts.
Over against <hi>Kisilagats,</hi> and about three leagues from the Continent, there are two Islands na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

                     <p>
                        <hi>Febr.</hi> 12. we travell'd on, through a plain Country, but cross'd by several small Rivers, the
chiefest whereof were the <hi>Vskeru,</hi> and the <hi>Butaru,</hi> and we lodg'd at night, at <hi>Elliesdu,</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
seated at the entrance of the Heath of <hi>Mokan,</hi> at the foot of a hill, which is very fruitful,
as is also the rest of the Country, on the mountain-side. It belong'd to a Military Officer, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Beter Sulthan,</hi> who had his ordinary residence at a place six leagues thence. The houses of
this Village were very wretched ones, as being built only with laths nail'd across, and plaister'd
over with clay. They were inhabited by Souldiers, on whom the King bestows the revenue
of his Demesin in these parts, with certain Lands which they are oblig'd to cultivate.</p>
                     <p>In this Village,<note place="margin">A harba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous action of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador <hi>Brugman.</hi>
                        </note> the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> caus'd a <hi>Persian</hi> to be kill'd with cudgelling. His
Groom would have gone into the first house he came to, with one of the led-horses: the <hi>Kisil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach,</hi>
or soldier, who was the Master of it, told him, that his house was free from quartering,
and that besides, he had no convenience for the entertainment of horses, whereupon, having a
stick in his hand, he therewith struck the horse over the head, but very slightly. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
<hi>Brugman,</hi> who saw this contestation, was so enrag'd at the resistance of the <hi>Kisilbach,</hi>
that he immediately alighted, and ran in to him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kisilbach,</hi> who said afterwards that he knew him not, and was far from imagining, that
an Ambassador would engage himself in such a business, and, as a Soldier could not brook an
affront in his own house, stood upon the defensive, and gave the Ambassador such a blow over
the arm with his stick, that he was forc'd to cry out for help.</p>
                     <p>His Domesticks came in upon the noise, and gave the <hi>Kisilbach</hi> such a beating, that he was
mortally wounded, and had much ado to crawl into the next house, to avoid their further fury.
The Ambassador, notwithstanding all this, would needs make his complaint to the <hi>Meheman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi>
of the insolence of the <hi>Kisilbach;</hi> whereto the other reply'd, that he knew not what to do
in the business; that he had no power over the <hi>Kisilbachs;</hi> that the Superiour Officer was not
there, to give him satisfaction, and, withall this, that he who had injur'd him, had receiv'd
such a chastisement, as he thought he could hardly ever recover, and that if he were not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,
he might do himself what further satisfaction he thought fit. <hi>Brugman,</hi> presuming upon
this permission, immediately sent to plunder the <hi>Kisilbach</hi>'s house, and order'd his horse and
arms to be brought away. The next day, he got together all the retinue, and caus'd it to be
publish'd by sound of Drum, that all should get on horse-back, in order to their departure out
of the Village, and that all who should stay there, after the Ambassadors were gone, might do
it at their own peril.</p>
                     <p>Not one of the Company knew his design, no, not his Collegue; but it was soon discover'd,
when he himself, being got on horse-back, and making a halt before the Ambassador's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
told the <hi>Mehemandar,</hi> that he should bring forth the man, who had struck him the day
before. The <hi>Mehemandar</hi> told him, he was so dangerously wounded, that he was not able
to rise; but the Ambassador not satisfy'd with that answer, order'd him to be brought thither
in a Coverlet, and, notwithstanding the mediation of the other <hi>Persians,</hi> who with great sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
begg'd the <hi>Kisilbach</hi>'s pardon, he commanded an <hi>Armenian,</hi> who was an Interpreter
for the <hi>Turkish</hi> Language, named <hi>Mark-Filerossein,</hi> to beat him with a great Cudgel, after the
same manner as he had been beaten the day before.</p>
                     <p>This merciless Rogue gave him one blow over the arm,<note place="margin">Causes a <hi>Kisilbach</hi> to be kill'd in cold blood.</note> and another upon the side, wherewith
he dispatch'd the poor <hi>Kisilbach,</hi> who stirr'd a little afterwards; but when the <hi>Armenian</hi> would,
by order from <hi>Brugman,</hi> have prosecuted the execution, he found the man quite dead. The
Ambassador seeing him in that posture, said, 'tis very well, he hath what he deserv'd; and thereupon
turning to the <hi>Mehemandar,</hi> and the other <hi>Persians,</hi> he told them, that if <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi> did not
revenge him for the affront be had receiv'd, he would return again in a short time, so well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that he should do himself satisfaction. The other Soldiers made it appear by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:47786:181"/>
that they wanted neither will nor courage to express their resentment of the injury
done them, and cut all our throats, and I know not whether it were the presence of the <hi>Mehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandar,</hi>
that prevented them from doing it; but certain it is, that it would have been no hard
matter for them to do it, and that it was the effect of a miraculous providence, that we escap'd
that misfortune.</p>
                     <p>We travell'd that day, which was the 13. of <hi>February,</hi> two leagues over the Heath of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan,</hi>
and lodg'd, that night, at <hi>Oba,</hi> in Shepherds hurts. The <hi>Mehemandar,</hi> who had staid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
in the Village, overtook us at night, and brought us word that the <hi>Kisilbach</hi> was dead,
and demanded of the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> the Horse, Arms, and other things, which he had
from the deceas'd person, to be sent to his Widdow and Children, whom he had left in a very
sad condition.</p>
                     <p>I observ'd that morning, that the Sun rose towards East-south-east, and consequently, that
the Load-stone declin'd 24. degrees from the North towards the West, and at <hi>Oba,</hi> I found the
Sun, at noon, at the height of forty degrees, forty eight minutes, and consequently, that
the elevation of the Pole, under that Meridian, was thirty nine degrees, twenty eight mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes.</p>
                     <p>The Sea-coast lay from South-west to North-east, and we had a sight of the mountain of
<hi>Scamachie,</hi> towards the North.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the Heath of <hi>Mokan,</hi> it is held to be sixty <hi>Farsangs</hi> in length, and twenty in
breadth. The <hi>Turks</hi> call it <hi>Mindunluck,</hi> that is, <hi>a thousand wayes,</hi> or <hi>thousand holes, at which
the smoak comes out,</hi> and the <hi>Persians, Mogan,</hi> or <hi>Mokan.</hi> It is inhabited by several peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and families, whose Predecessors, having born Arms under the command of <hi>Iesid</hi> against
<hi>Hossein,</hi> were banish'd into this Desert, and they are not permitted to live either in Cities or
Villages. In Summer, they encamp at the foot of the Mountain; and in Winter, they lodge
in Tents upon the Heath.</p>
                     <p>They subsist by their Cattel, but so poorly, that it is as much as they can do. Whence it
comes, that they are called <hi>Sumek Rajeti,</hi> either for that, <hi>from bone to bone,</hi> that is, from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Son, they are subject to the King no otherwise than as the most miserable Slaves are, or
that they have hardly left them wherewith to cover their bones. They are a kind of Savages,
and their chief families are called <hi>Chotze Tschaubani, Tekle, Elmenku, Hatzikasilu, Sulthan
baschelu, Carai, Ardenduschenlu, Chaletz,</hi> &amp;c. I speak in another particular Treatise of the
origine of these families, and the manner of life of these people.</p>
                     <p>The 14. we travell'd three leagues,<note place="margin">A Robber General of an Army.</note> drawing towards the North, and lodg'd at night among
the <hi>Hatzicasilu.</hi> We saw, in a Chapel by the way, the Sepulchre of <hi>Bairam Tekle Obasi.</hi>
He was the famous Robber, who liv'd in the time of <hi>Schach Abas,</hi> who coming to be head of a
strong party of Toryes, did abundance of mischief to the <hi>Bassa Tzakal Ogli,</hi> who was entred
<hi>Persia</hi> with a <hi>Turkish</hi> Army, insomuch that there hardly pass'd a day, but he sent some <hi>Turks</hi>
heads to the King.</p>
                     <p>These little advantages, and the booty he got, improv'd his retinue to the number of twelve
thousand men, who did the <hi>Turks</hi> more mischief than the Royal Army could. <hi>Schach-Abas</hi>
requited his services, by honouring him with the quality of <hi>Chan,</hi> and bestowing on him the
revenue of certain Villages, and some Lands, to maintain the new Dignity.</p>
                     <p>We lodg'd that night in Hurts, and were hardly laid down, ere we heard the noise of a great
volley of small shot; which gave us a hot alarm, and oblig'd us to put our selves into a posture
of defence, in expectation of some engagement. We thought at first, that the <hi>Kisilbachs</hi> had a
design to revenge the cruelty, which the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> had exercis'd the day before on
one of their Camerades; but we understood soon after, that what had been done, was by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the <hi>Muscovian Poslanick,</hi> purposely to frighten the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> though he
would make us believe, it was to honour him, out of an imagination he seem'd to have, that it
was the said Ambassador's birth-day.</p>
                     <p>The 15. we travell'd eight leagues along the Heath, and lodg'd within a quarter of a league
of the River <hi>Aras.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We intended to take up our quarters that night at <hi>Tzauat;</hi> but understanding that <hi>Areb, Chan</hi>
of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> was lodg'd there with his whole Court, and that he would stay there all the next
day, we also resolv'd to continue the 16. at the place where we were.</p>
                     <p>We had some reason to be distrustfull of <hi>Areb-Chan,</hi> by reason of what had happen'd between
us at our first passage: but he made it appear that the <hi>Persians</hi> have this also common with all
Generous minds, that they can forget injuries. For he did us no unkindness; nay, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as long as we were in his Government, he let slip no occasion of obliging us, laying the
cause of our misunderstanding one the other, on the Interpreter <hi>Rustan,</hi> who had forsaken us,
and, as he said, had made him several bad reports of us, not doubting but he had said as much
to us of him, and protesting that if he had him, his head should go off for it. He order'd us to
be receiv'd by a Person of Quality of his retinue, upon the first news were brought him of
our being come to the River <hi>Aras,</hi> and made us a Present of three baggs of Wine, which came
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:47786:182"/>
to us very seasonably, in as much as that day, and the day before, we had been but poorly
treated. <hi>Aetzebeg,</hi> who had been our <hi>Mehemandar</hi> at our former passage, came also to visit
the Ambassadors, and presented them with an excellent Greyhound-bitch.</p>
                     <p>The 17. we cross'd over the famous River <hi>Araxes,</hi> near <hi>Tzauat,</hi> where they had made a
Bridge of Boats, which they call <hi>Tzissi.</hi> The antient Historians and Geographers speak so
differently of this River, that I conceive it will not be amiss I said somewhat here of it by
the way.</p>
                     <p>True it is,<note place="margin">The River <hi>Aras.</hi>
                        </note> most of them put it in the Province, wherein it really lies, but they are mistaken
in the description of its Course, in as much as they do not well understand <hi>Q. Curtius,</hi> who
speaks of it in two several passages, but in a different sense. For in the 5. Book he puts it in
<hi>Persida,</hi> and sayes its course is Southward; and in the 7. Book, he makes it pass through <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
and to fall into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. Nor does <hi>Strabo</hi> express himself more clearly. <hi>Raderus,</hi>
in his Commentaries upon <hi>Q. Curtius,</hi> thinks to make these passages very clear, by saying,
that the River <hi>Medus,</hi> into which the <hi>Araxes</hi> fall, hath its course, at first, from North to
South, and that it falls into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. But he is mistaken; for it is impossible, that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
should make its way through the dreadfull mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> which is many leagues in
breadth, and which runs through all <hi>Persia,</hi> nay indeed all <hi>Asia,</hi> and pass from <hi>Persepolis</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. But the truth is, there are two Rivers of the same name of <hi>Araxes</hi> in
<hi>Persia;</hi> one, in <hi>Media,</hi> the other in <hi>Persida.</hi> As to that which passes by the walls of <hi>Persepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
now known by the name of <hi>Schiras, Q. Curtius</hi> calls it <hi>Araxes,</hi> as he gives to the <hi>Iaxar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
which passes to the Frontiers of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> the name of <hi>Tanais,</hi> and that of <hi>Cancasus</hi>
to the Eastern part of the mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> for which it would much gravel him to shew any
reason.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> call that which is in <hi>Persida, Bend-Emir,</hi> by reason of a great Miracle, which
they believe <hi>Aly</hi> did there, and it falls into the Ocean near the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf. That which we
cross'd over in the Heaths of <hi>Mokan,</hi> still keeps its name, which is deriv'd, if we may credit
<hi>Eustathius,</hi> from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which signifies to <hi>pluck,</hi> in as much as, when it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflows,
it plucks up, and carries along with it whatever lies in its way. It rises out of the
mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> behind the great <hi>Ararat,</hi> and receiving into its Chanel, the waters of
many other Rivers, the chiefest whereof are <hi>Karasu, Senki, Kerni,</hi> and <hi>Arpa,</hi> it goes near <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasu,</hi>
a great way into the Land, and falls soon after near <hi>Ordabath,</hi> with such a noise, as is
heard above two leagues thence, in the Plain of <hi>Mokan,</hi> which lies very low, in comparison
of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Schiruan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Its course there is very slow, and after it is joined, viz. 12. leagues above <hi>Tazuat,</hi> with the
River <hi>Cur</hi> or <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (which is as big as it self, and comes Northwar'd out of <hi>Georgia</hi> or <hi>Gurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zistan</hi>)
it falls into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. Whence it appears, that <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and those who follow
him, are mistaken, when they affirm, that the <hi>Araxes</hi> and the <hi>Cyrus</hi> fall into the <hi>Caspain</hi>
Sea by two different chanels; as also when they say, that the City of <hi>Cyropolis</hi> was that which

gives him. But if it were so, we must put these two Rivers, not above, but below the
City, towards the South, in as much as we found their Conflux or meeting together, which
the <hi>Persians</hi> call <hi>Kanschan,</hi> at thirty nine degrees, fifty four minutes, and <hi>Scamachie,</hi> at forty
degrees, fifly minutes, that is, thirteen leagues thence, and under another Meridian. And
indeed we found such a distance between them, when we travell'd those parts. Nor is there any
other River, eminent enough or big enough, within nineteen dayes journey of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> on
either side of it, to deserve that name.</p>
                     <p>The 17. we took up our Quarters at <hi>Tzauat,</hi> where we were receiv'd, and magnificently
treated by the <hi>Mehemandar,</hi> whom the <hi>Chan</hi> had sent to us. This Vill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this River, people are oblig'd to shew their pass-port, which is done, to prevent the entrance
of the <hi>Turks</hi> into the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>The 19. we travell'd eight leagues, for the most part, over barren Lands, and a desert
Country, cover'd with Reeds, and lodg'd, that night, at the foot of the mountain of <hi>Scama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi>

months together by a quartane ague, whereto a flux joyning carried him away in four dayes.
He died by the way in a Wagon, and in ill weather. We had him buried the 22. before the
City of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> in the Church-yard belonging to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> with the ordinary Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of our own Country.</p>
                     <p>The 20. we were upon our way betimes in the morning,<note place="margin">The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Scamachie</hi>
                        </note> that we might, in good time, pass
over the mountain of <hi>Scamachie,</hi> which extends it self in those parts like a Crescent, towards
the East, from the Sea, along the River <hi>Cyr,</hi> and it is called there, <hi>Lengebus tachi,</hi> by reason
of a Village, named <hi>Lengebus,</hi> which is upon the op of the mountain.</p>
                     <p>The rain, which was then so cold, that we thought Winter coming on again, had so broken
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47786:182"/>
the high-wayes, that this was one of the saddest dayes journey we had ever since our first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadors, and such others as were well mounted, got to the City ere day-light was
shut in, but it was very late ere the rest reach'd it; nay some got not thither till after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
some, not till the next morning.</p>
                     <p>The Camels, which being so heavily loaden, where not able to get up so narrow and slippery
a way as is that of the Mountain, came not till eight dayes after. The <hi>Chan</hi> had assign'd us the
same Quarters we had had, at our former passage that way; so that we were all lodg'd at the
houses of the same <hi>Armeniaus,</hi> our antient Landlords. They receiv'd us very kindly, and as
to the Ambassadors, the <hi>Chan</hi> sent them a Supper from his own Kitchin.</p>
                     <p>For my own particular, I had several Presents sent me from my friends, and Tutors, as
<hi>Maheb Aly,</hi> the <hi>Molla, Imanculi,</hi> and <hi>Chalil,</hi> who sent me several dishes of Apples,
and Grapes, and came to see me the next day, to examine how I had improv'd my self in their

and their retinue to a Supper. In the evening, the <hi>Chan</hi> sent horses, to bring them to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
He treated us magnificently; and entertain'd us with very civil discourses, and such as
were the more obliging, in that we afterwards found the effects of them, during our aboad
at <hi>Scamachie,</hi> where we continu'd five weeks; during which, we had the divertisement of
several hunting matches, and were treated a great Feasts, which the <hi>Chan</hi> made from time to
time purposely for us.</p>

                     <p>The 3. 6. and 10. the <hi>Chan</hi> treated us at his own Palace, to celebrate their <hi>Naurus,</hi> or

                     <p>
                        <hi>March 14. Areb-Chan</hi> receiv'd an assurance of the continuance of the King's favour towards
him,<note place="margin">How the K of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> assures the <hi>Chans</hi> of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</note> according to the custome, by the Present of a new Garment: in as much as when the
<hi>Chans</hi> and Governours have made their ordinary Presents, the King sends an express to them,
to assure them, either of his favour or displeasure; whereof the Ceremony is this. The King's
Envoy or Express, being come within three or four leagues of the City, sends a Messenger, to
give the Governour notice of it, and to let him know he brings him good news. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
who many times is not sure to return again, takes his leave of the City, as if he were
not to come thither any more, and goes a league out of the City, to meet the Envoy, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
by all his friends.</p>
                     <p>As soon as the Envoy sees the Governour coming, he makes a halt, and the Governour
alights, and puts off his Sword, Garment, and Turbant, and in that posture approches the
Envoy, who hath in a Box cover'd with some rich Tapistry, a Letter of grace, with a new
Garment, or else an order to bring the Governour's head. If the Kings favour be confirm'd to
him, he receives from the Envoy, the new Garment, which he kisses at the collar, touches
with his fore head, and then puts it on.</p>
                     <p>If the Envoy hath an order to bring away the Governour's head, he presently hath it cut off,
puts it into the Box, and immediately returns. There are diverse examples of these executions
in the time of <hi>Schach-Abas,</hi> as also in that of <hi>Schach-Sefi,</hi> The former caus'd to be executed
after this manner, <hi>Ahmad, Chan</hi> of <hi>Hemedan, Kaban, Chan</hi> of <hi>Orumi,</hi> and <hi>Baisunkur

of <hi>Maku,</hi> and <hi>Moral, Sulthan</hi> of <hi>Bajesid.</hi> But this last caus'd them to be strangled, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be flead, and order'd their skins, fill'd with Hay, to be set in the high-way, because
they had over-easily deliver'd up those places wherewith he had entrusted them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Areb-Chan</hi> intreated the Ambassadors to be present at an action, which he knew could not
be otherwise than advantageous to him, in so much that he had got a large dose of drink, ere
he went out of the City. He was mounted on an excellent Roan horse, without any Arms,
causing to be led before him several other gallant horses with rich trappings, and having about
his person fifteen of his Guard, with their Carabins, and a retinue of about four hundred men
besides the Ambassadors, and the <hi>Calenter,</hi> who accompany'd him with their Domesticks. He
march'd in this order, as far as the King's Garden, without the City, halting several times,
to make the Company drink, and causing several young Lads to dance in the mean time. His
two Sons, whereof the elder was but 20. years of age, and the younger 18. both very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
well shap'd persons, follow'd him with most of the Inhabitants of the City, and certain
men on horse-back, who were cover'd with Lynxes-skins, and the furres of <hi>Buchar</hi>-Sheep,
and carried on the tops of long Poles, certain <hi>Turks</hi> Heads fill'd with Hay, and the Colours,
which <hi>Areb</hi> had taken from them.</p>
                     <p>He alighted before the Garden, and found the King's Envoy at the entrance of it, attended
by three Servants, and holding the Box in his hand. The <hi>Chan</hi> being come within ten or twelve
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:47786:183"/>
paces of the Envoy, he very cheerfully put off his Garment and Turbant, but perceiving the
Envoy stood a while, without saying ought to him, he began to be a little startled and out of
countenance, till the Envoy said to him, <hi>Ai, Areb-Chan,</hi> whereto <hi>Areb</hi> answer'd, <hi>Nedier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi>
what saiest thou? The Envoy continu'd, <hi>Schach Sefi ne chales kunderdiwe rakem, Schach
Sefi dnsti sen,</hi> that is, <q>
                           <hi>Schach Sefi</hi> sends thee a Garment, and a Letter of Favour; thou
art certainly belov'd of the King.</q> Whereto the <hi>Chan</hi> reply'd very couragiously, <hi>Scahung dowletti
berkarar, olsumwe birkuni minkun olsun men seahung birkari kulim:</hi> that is, <q>May the King's
Wealth continue for ever, and may every day of his be as a thousand; I am one of the King's
old Servants.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He thereupon took the Garment, with very great submission. It was of Sea-green Satin.
The Envoy help'd him to put it on, with a Rochet of cloath of Gold, a Girdle, and Turbant.</p>
                     <p>The Envoy had, for his pains, a Present of certain <hi>Tumains.</hi> Then the <hi>Casi,</hi> or Judge,
made a Prayer for the King's health, which ended, the <hi>Chan</hi>'s Steward, cry'd out, <hi>Schach

of the King, the success of his Soldiers, and the health of the <hi>Chan,</hi>

answer'd, <hi>Alla, Alla, Alla.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Ceremonies ended, the Trumpets sounded, and the Tymbrels were play'd on, and
and the <hi>Chan</hi> return'd to the City, causing to be carried, before him, the <hi>Turks</hi> heads and
Colours, which, at his coming thence, had march'd after him. The <hi>Chan</hi> invited the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to Dinner; but he himself had drunk so liberally, that he was forc'd to rise from
Table, and the Company soon after withdrew.</p>
                     <p>The 22. being <hi>Maundy Thursday,</hi>

                           <hi>Armenian</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> the <hi>Armenians</hi> performed the Ceremony of the washing
of Feet, in memory of the beginning of our Saviour's Passion: They all came to Church,
where the Priest wash'd the right foot of the Men, and the left foot of the Women, and made
thereon the sign of the Cross, with Butter, which had been consecrated to that purpose: And
that done, he was cast into a Chair by twelve men, who rais'd him up into the air, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
of joy, and kept him there, till he had promis'd to treat them with a Dinner.</p>
                     <p>The 25. the <hi>Armenians</hi> began their year,<note place="margin">The <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> begin the year at Easter.</note> and in regard that day fell on their <hi>Easter,</hi> they
made a great Procession out of the City. The <hi>Chan</hi> would needs see it, and made a great exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
for us, during which, the <hi>Armenians</hi> stood with their Banners, Crosses and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
before his Tent. Which they did only to please the <hi>Persians,</hi> in as much as, when the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi>
Ambassador, who was troubled to see those poor people stand there so long in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
sent them word, that they might be gone with their Images, they made answer, that
they ought not to stirr thence, without express order from the <hi>Chan.</hi> The <hi>Armenian</hi> Women
gave us the divertisement of their dancing, in three Companies, which successively reliev'd one
another. The <hi>Chan</hi> gave us another kind of sport, by letting loose among the People, two
Wolves, ty'd to long Ropes, to be drawn back when they pleas'd. He caus'd also the head
of one of those wild Beasts which they call <hi>Ahu</hi>'s to be cut off at one blow with a Cymitar. That
was done by this sleight, first they gave the Beast a blow over the back, which made it lift up
the head, so that they could hardly miss it. That night I was stung by a Seorpion.</p>
                     <p>The 26. came to <hi>Scamachie,</hi>

mutually taken leave with the greatest expressions of civility, the <hi>Chan</hi> return'd, with his
Company, to <hi>Seamachie,</hi> and we took our way towards <hi>Pyrmaras,</hi> whither we came in the
evening, after we had travell'd, that afternoon, three leagues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>March</hi> the last, we were on our way by eight in the morning, and we got that day six
leagues, all over mountains, whence we had not the sight of so much as one Village. At night we
came into a Valley, to the Village of <hi>Cochani,</hi> where we lodg'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>April</hi> 1. we travell'd seven leagues,<note place="margin">APRIL.</note> over hills and dales, till we came to the Village of <hi>Bahel,</hi>
otherwise called <hi>Surrat,</hi> from the fruitfulness of the Country, especially by reason of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Millet growing there, beyond what any other part of <hi>Persia</hi> affords.</p>
                     <p>The 2. we got out of the mountain into the plain Country, leaving the Rock of <hi>Barmuch</hi> on
the right hand, and coming within a quarter of a league of the Sea. We saw, as we pass'd by,
within the space of five hundred paces,<note place="margin">Sources of <hi>Nefte.</hi>
                        </note> above thirty sources of <hi>Nefte,</hi> which is a kind of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:47786:183"/>
above at the pits mouth, might hear the Oil coming out in great bubbles, sending up a
strong smell, though that of the white <hi>Nefte</hi> be incomparably more pleasant than that of the
black: for there are two sorts of it, but much more of the black, than of the white. We tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
that day six leagues, and lodg'd at night, at the Village of <hi>Kisicht,</hi> not far from the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The third, we got two leagues, and lodg'd at night, at <hi>Schabran,</hi> having pass'd over three
little Rivers.</p>
                     <p>There lives in the mountains of these parts a certain people,<note place="margin">

rapine, and course up and down the high-wayes for twenty leagues about, to rob Travellers.
We were told, that, the day before, they came to the Village, to inquite how strong we
were, how we march'd, and what Guard we kept in our quarters.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mehemandar</hi> and the Inhabitants advis'd us to keep a strong Guard, and to keep close
together, as well in our march, as at our quarters. Whence it came, that ever after, we kept
still in sight of the Baggage. The Inhabitants of <hi>Schabran</hi> are, in their Language, called <hi>Kur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which occasion'd the mistake of diverse of our people in their Journals, who thought they were
the people called <hi>Kurdes.</hi> But it was a great oversight, in as much as the <hi>Kurdes</hi> live in <hi>Kur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desthan,</hi>
which is the ancient <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> a Province far distant from that we now speak of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Apr.</hi> 4. we travell'd four leagues through a hilly, yet very delightful, Country. We o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertook
by the way a <hi>Caravanne</hi> of <hi>Muscovian</hi> and <hi>Circassian</hi> Merchants, who were very glad
of our Company, to secure them against the incursions of those Robbers.</p>
                     <p>There appear'd one of them, who would have taken notice of our march, and strength; but
the <hi>Mehemandar</hi> immediately commanded out ten or twelve <hi>Persians,</hi> who pursu'd him into
the Wood, where they lost him. He had stoln an Ox, and being forc'd to leave him behind,
the <hi>Mehemandar</hi> made a Present of him to the Ambassadors.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon, we came to <hi>Mischkar,</hi> a Village lying in a fenny place, within two leagues
of <hi>Niasabath,</hi> where our ship was wrack'd. The Inhabitants of the Village, who took us for
enemies, had left all, and were got into the Woods: but understanding afterwards upon what
accompt we came, they had the confidence to return to their houses. We found in the house
of one of their Priests, many fair Manuscripts.</p>
                     <p>The fifth we travell'd eight leagues, through woody roads. and deserts, to the Village of
<hi>Koptepe.</hi> We saw by the way the Sepulchre of one of their Saints, named <hi>Pyr Schich Molla
Iusuf,</hi> and met with a party of five and twenty Horsemen, well mounted and well arm'd. They
said they were Country people of the adjacent Villages, and that they were forc'd to go in
strong parties, and to travel so arm'd, to secure themselves against the Robbers thereabouts:
but they look'd more like such themselves. For we understood afterwards, that the inhabitants
of the Village, where we lodg'd that day, were <hi>Padars.</hi> Their houses were built upon the
ascent of certain little hills, half within the Earth, being encompass'd about with a knot of
trees, which made a delightful prospect from one house to another.</p>
                     <p>The 6. we travell'd three leagues, all through a continu'd Forest, and we cross'd the three
Rivers of <hi>Kossar, Sambur,</hi> and <hi>Kurgane.</hi> That of <hi>Sambur</hi> is the most considerable, and rises out
of the mountain of <hi>Elbours,</hi> dividing it self at this place into five branches, the chanels where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were so broad, that our horses, as we pass'd through, had not water up to half the
legs.</p>
                     <p>The 7. having gone three leagues,<note place="margin">Come to <hi>Derbent.</hi>
                        </note> we came to the most antient City of <hi>Derbent.</hi> There came
to meet us only a certain number of <hi>Kisilbachs,</hi> in regard the Governour, <hi>Scahewerdi Sulthan,</hi>
between whom and his horse-men there was some difference, durst not come out of the Castle,
lest the <hi>Kisilbachs</hi> should possess themselves of it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> put this City at 85. degrees longitude,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Derbent</hi> described.</note> and I found it at forty one degrees, fifty
minutes, latitude. It is in length, reaching from East to West, about a league; and in breadth,
four hundred and fifty ordinary paces.</p>
                     <p>It serves for a Gate to the Kingdom of <hi>Persia</hi> on that side, for, on one side it reaches to the
foot of the mountain, and on the other, to the Sea, which is so neer, that sometimes the
waves beat over the walls.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> Authors, as also the Inhabitants of the City, affirm, that it was built by <hi>Iscan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
that is, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; not such as it is now (for that honour is due to their King
<hi>Nauschiruan</hi>) but only the Castle, and the Wall, which encompasses the City on the South-side.
These walls are very high, and at least five or six foot thick, and viewing them at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
a man would think them built of the best and fairest kind of free-stone; but coming neer
them, he finds that the Stones are made of Muscle-shels, and pieces of free-stone beaten and
molded like Brick, which time hath reduc'd to a hardness beyond that of Marble.</p>
                     <p>I found upon one of the Gates which are remaining of the building of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,
a <hi>Syriack</hi> Inscription, of three lines, and in another place certain <hi>Arabick</hi> words, and strange
Characters, but so eaten out by time, that they were not legible. The Castle, where the <hi>Chan</hi>
lives, is upon the top of the mountain, and kept by a Garrison of five hundred men, who are
of two several Nations, <hi>Asumrumlu,</hi> and <hi>Koidurscha.</hi> The second quarter of the City is at the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:47786:184"/>
foot of the mountain, and the most populous; but the lower part of it is very much ruin'd,
since <hi>Emir Hamse,</hi> the Son of <hi>Chadabende,</hi> recover'd the City, out of the hands of <hi>Mustapha,</hi>
the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour, to whom the Inhabitants had voluntarily submitted themselves.</p>
                     <p>The lower part, and that which reaches to the Sea, is about two thousand ordinary paces
in compass; but it lies desert, having no houses, but converted into Gardens and Corn-fields.
It was heretofore inhabited by <hi>Greeks,</hi> whence the <hi>Persians</hi> call it, to this day, <hi>Scaher Iunan,</hi>
that is, the <hi>Greek City.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this coast is pure Rock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon which score it is very dangerous for Vessels. It serves for a
foundation to the walls of the whole City, which are so broad, that a Wagon may easily be
driven on them. The mountain above the City, is cover'd with wood, where there may be
yet seen the ruins of a wall, above fifty leagues in length, which, as we were told, had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
serv'd for a communication between the <hi>Caspian</hi> and <hi>Euxine</hi> Seas. In some places it was
some five or six foot high, in other, but two, in others, there was no track of any. There
might be seen also on other hills, the ruins of several old Castles, whereby it might be judg'd,
that they were built four square. There were two undemolish'd, and had garrisons in them.
There are also several redoubts of wood, upon all the avenues.</p>
                     <p>The most remarkable thing about this City is the Sepulchre of <hi>Tzumtzume,</hi> of whom the
<hi>Persians</hi> relate this story, after their Poet <hi>Fiesuli,</hi> who hath left in writing.</p>
                     <p>They affirm,<note place="margin">The Fable of <hi>Tzumt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zume.</hi>
                        </note> that <hi>Eissi</hi> (so they call our Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>) coming one day into those
parts, found in his way a dead man's skull, and desirous to know whose it had been, pray'd to
God, with whom he was in great favour, to raise that deceased person to life again, which
God accordingly did, and then <hi>Eissi</hi> asked him, who he was. He made answer, his name was
<hi>Tzumtzume,</hi> that he had been King of all that Country, and so powerful, that he consumed
every day in his Court as much salt as forty Camels were able to carry. That he had forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

But says <hi>Tzumtzume</hi> to <hi>Eissi,</hi> Who art thou? And what Religion dost thou profess?
Whereto <hi>Christ</hi> made answer, I am <hi>Eissi,</hi> and my Religion is that which saves all the World.
If it be so, reply'd <hi>Tzumtzume,</hi> I am of thy Religion; but I pray thee let me dy assoon as
may be, for, having been heretofore so pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rful, it would extremely trouble me to be here
now without a Kingdom and Subjects. <hi>Eissi</hi> granted his request, and immediately permitted
him to dy; and at this place is his Sepulchre, over which there is a great tree, and, adjoining
to that, there is a Scaffold erected, ten foot high, and sixteen, square.</p>
                     <p>We took notice, on this side of the City, of about five or six thousand Tombs, cover'd
with stones, much larger than the ordinary stature of men, all half round, Cylinder-wise, and
hollow within. They had all of them <hi>Arabick</hi> Inscriptions, and it is reported, that antiently,
yet since the time of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> there had been, in <hi>Media,</hi> a King named <hi>Kassan,</hi> by birth,
an <hi>Okus,</hi> (a people living in <hi>Thabesseran,</hi> behind the mountain of <hi>Ebbours</hi>) who being ingag'd
in a war against the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Dagesthan,</hi> whom they call <hi>Lesgi,</hi> was desirous to give them
battel in that place; but that he was there defeated, and that he caus'd the Officers then kill'd
to be buried in the Tombs which are yet to be seen there. Towards the Sea-side, there were
forty others compass'd by a wall, but much bigger than any of the fore-mentioned. These, as
the Inhabitants affirmed, were the Sepulchres of so many great Lords, and holy Persons, who
had been kill'd in the same battel. Every Sepulchre had its Banner.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> name these Sepulchres <hi>Tziltenan,</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars, Kerchler.</hi> The
<hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> do their devotions at them, in so much that this place was heretofore very
famous, both for the many foundations, and charities given thereto: but now it is kept by an
antient man, who makes a poor shift to live upon the Alms that are given him.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Kassan,</hi> who liv'd many years after this Battel, is interr'd neer <hi>Tabris,</hi> neer a River,
named <hi>Atzi,</hi> that is, <hi>bitter waters.</hi> The Tomb of Queen <hi>Burla,</hi> his wife, is to be seen neer
the Fortress of <hi>Vrumi,</hi> and they say it is forty foot long.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Apr.</hi> 13. we saw several <hi>Tartars,</hi> as well men as women, coming to do their devotions
there, which consisted in going, one after another, to kiss the Sepulchres of these forty Saints,
upon which they set their hands while they pray'd. It was the tenth day of their <hi>Silhatza,</hi> on
which they make a commemoration of the sacrifice of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are not any Christians at <hi>Derbent,</hi> but the Inhabitants are all <hi>Mussulmans,</hi> unless it
be some few Jews, who pretend to be of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> It is accordingly a place of no
Commerce, save only that the <hi>Tartars</hi> bring thither a great many stoln Children, or haply
such <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Muscovites,</hi> as they have taken upon some occasion or other, and there sell
them, to be carried further into the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>The Soldiers who kept the Garrison there, as also the Citizens, were a proud, daring, and
insolent sort of people, so far from treating us with any civility, that, on the contrary, they
did what they could to pick a quarrel with us.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mehemandar</hi> himself gave us notice before-hand, to stand upon our guard: whence it
came, that, on the 8. after Sermon, the Ambassadors order'd, upon several penalties, that none
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:47786:184"/>
of their retinue, should, either in word or deed, give occasion of offence to any Soldier, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant,
nor relieve any person whom they should find engag'd in any quarrel with them,
lest they should take occasion, from a particular difference, to fall upon the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                     <p>The 9. the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Tarku,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Chan Tarku</hi> proffers to convoy the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</note> who had given the Ambassadors a visit, at their former passage
that way, sent us word, that the way we were to travel through the Country of the <hi>Tartars</hi> of
<hi>Dagesthan,</hi> was very dangerous, desiring us to make use of the Convoy he proffer'd us. The
Ambassadors, considering that those proffers were made by a <hi>Tartar</hi> of <hi>Dagesthan,</hi> and that
there were no more safety in his Company, than among the Robbers themselves, return'd him
their thanks, and sent him word, that they would not put him to that trouble. However we
thought it prudence, to make our advantage of the notice given us of the danger we might fall
into among those <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and we order'd a view to be made of our Arms, and found, there
were among us, two and fifty Muskets and Firelocks, ninteen cases of Pistols, two brass
Guns, and four murthering-pieces, all well fixt, and fit for service.</p>
                     <p>Having staid some time for <hi>Imanculi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">They take order for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</note> who had promis'd to follow us within a few dayes, and
finding our selves in a place, where the Governour, instead of supplying us with provisions,
forc'd us to buy all at a dear rate, the Ambassadors resolv'd the 12. to give order for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
commanded the Baggage to be made ready, and deliver'd every man his allowance of
bread for four dayes, in as much as there was no great likelyhood we should find much at the
places we were to travel through.</p>
                     <p>The 13. we were got on horse-back,<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it.</note> and ready to march, when word was brought, that
the Governour had shut the City-gate. This news somewhat startled us, and oblig'd the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to send the <hi>Mchemandar</hi> to him, to know the reason of his so doing. His answer was,
that, having receiv'd intelligence, that <hi>Osmin,</hi> a <hi>Tartar</hi>-Prince, not far from <hi>Derbent,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to set upon us by the way, and put us to an excessive ransome, or take away all we had,
and that being responsable to the King for what might happen to us, he thought it not fit we
should go thence without a Convoy, which being not to be had that day, he desir'd us to stay
till the next.</p>
                     <p>We knew the Convoy he intended us, would serve us in no stead, and that the care he took
proceeded not from any kindness he had for us; but it was fit, we put on the best face we could
upon it. and acknowledg'd our selves oblig'd to him. Only we sent to desire him, in regard we
were all mounted, to permit' us to encamp without the City, and there expect the Convoy.
He was content we should do so; whereupon we went and encamp'd a quarter of a league with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the City, near a Vineyard, upon the side of a small River, which serves for a common
Frontier, between the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Dagesthan</hi> and the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We found near that place the Sepulchres of two other <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Saints,<note place="margin">Other Saints Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres,</note> one, that of <hi>Pyr
Muchar,</hi> in the plain, at the foot of the mountain; the other, that of <hi>Imam Kurchud,</hi> within
the mountain. They say the later was of kin to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and that he alwayes sate at his feet,
to be instructed by him. They add, that he liv'd three hundred years after <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s death,
and that he retir'd to King <hi>Kassan,</hi> whom he diverted by his playing on the Lute, and incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
animated to make a war against the <hi>Lesgi,</hi> by the songs he sung to that instrument; but that
at last, presuming to preach to those <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who were <hi>Pagans,</hi> in hopes to convert them
to the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, they kill'd him.</p>
                     <p>His Sepulchre is in a Cave cut within the Rock. There is also another hollow place in the
same Rock, where there is a Coffin, made of four boards nail'd together, and rais'd about four
foot from the ground. I saw it over-night, and found at it, an old woman, who had the
keeping of the Sepulchre,; but the next day, I found it set forth with a Carpet of <hi>Brocado,</hi>
and the floor cover'd with Mat, for their convenience who came thither to do their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>There resorted thither many Women and Maids from the City, and other places, who went
all bare-foot into the Cave, kiss'd the Coffin, and, having said their prayers, made their offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to the old Woman, to whom they gave some Butter, Cheese, Milk, others, Bread, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Wax, and the like The night following we heard here a confus'd and dreadful noise, much
like that of persons singing, dancing, and weeping, all at the same time. I never heard any
thing so barbarous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Apr.</hi> 14. we expected our Convoy till three hours after Sun-rising;<note place="margin">

we set forward, observing the following order.</p>
                     <p>The three Lieutenants, with their Souldiers, having their matches lighted made the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard.</p>
                     <p>Next them, follow'd a Field-piece, of two pound and a half Bullet, upon a carriage with
four wheels, and then the four Murthering-pieces, with all things belonging to them, in a
Wagon.</p>
                     <p>Then marched the Camels, loaden with the baggage, having on both sides some of our reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,

Next the Baggage, came the other Field-piece, and after that, the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi>

the way we came. The mountain it self, in some places, comes within half a league of
the Sea, and in some it is two or three leagues from it, there being in the plains very fruitful
and pleasant fields, unless it be towards the Sea-side, where it is all heathy and barren.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants are of a yellowish and dark complexion, inclining to black; they are well
set and have strong limbs, dreadfully ugly in their faces, and wear their hair, which is black and
greasy, falling down over their shoulders. They are all barbarous and savages.</p>
                     <p>Their cloathing is a long close Coat,<note place="margin">Their habit.</note> of a grey or black colour, of a wretched coarse cloath,

all of one piece, and sow'd to their feet over the instep, and at the sides.</p>

Religion; but are so slenderly instructed therein, that it is not to be wondred, they
have so little devotion. They live by the Cattel they breed, whereof the Women take care,
while the men go up and down a-robbing, making no conscience to steal away the children of
their nearest relations, to sell them to the <hi>Persians</hi> and others. Whence it comes, that, even

name of the Lord of it. He sent to meet us his son, attended by fifteen persons on hors-back,
well arm'd, who after the first Complement, fell off on the left hand, and went into a Wood,
and we took the right. We quarter'd in the fields near a Village, fortifying our selves with the
Baggage, and securing our selves against the surprises of those Robbers, by a good number of
Sentinels, plac'd at all the avenues.</p>
                     <p>The young Prince return'd to our Quarters in the evening, but visited only the <hi>Muscovian</hi>

intended him a Present of 12. Duckats, and three pieces of <hi>Persia</hi>-Satin, had he honoured the
Ambassadors with a visit; but he thought it enough to do it by two of his Officers, whereupon
we only saluted him with the firing of two great Guns, charg'd with bullets, just at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                     <p>The 15. we prosecuted our journey, through a hilly Country, and had in our way good

and lodg'd near a Village of the same name, upon the ascent of a hill, which was so steepy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sea, that we were secure as to that side, and we fortify'd our Camp with the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,

The Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> was incens'd at the people's looking on us, as a thing they had

                        </note> and was enrag'd that those he spoke to would not execute so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
a command, which no doubt had cost us all our lives. For those Barbarians, who
were wicked and daring, and discover'd that they wanted only a pretence to set upon us, grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
that any should think it much they stood there, and were confident enough to tell us, that
the ground, they were then upon, was rather theirs, than ours, and that they had as much
right to be there as we had: That we might have forborn threatning them; that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
we were too strong for them; but that upon the least sign the <hi>Schemkal</hi> should give them,
they would come with such a force as were able to dispatch us all, though we were twice as
many. That they car'd for neither the King of <hi>Persia</hi> nor Duke of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> that they were <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasthans,</hi>
and acknowledg'd no Superiour but God. They would not, at first, suffer us to go
for water, without paying for it; but finding that the Well where it was to be had, was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the reach of our great Guns, and that we set things in order to force our way to it, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
and left us.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Schemkal</hi> sent us word late over-night, that we should not offer to go away the next
morning, till he had search'd our baggage, to see whether we carried any Merchants goods.
The Ambassadors return'd him answer, that they were not Merchants, but Ambassadors, and
that consequently they might pass all places without paying: That they would stand upon their
privilege, and that if the <hi>Schemkal</hi> offer'd them any violence, they should do what were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to the law of Nature and Nations to prevent it. But we heard no more of him.</p>

quarrell'd with the Inhabitants of <hi>Boinak,</hi> and was kill'd with all his retinue, only three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
excepted, who got back to <hi>Derbent,</hi> whence the <hi>Mehemandar,</hi> who had conducted him
thither, carried them to the Court. During their stay there, the King allow'd each of them
three <hi>Abas</hi>'s a day, till he found a convenience to send them home, which he did afterwards,
upon an Embassy which the Great Duke of <hi>Muscovy</hi> had sent to him.</p>
                     <p>The 16. we departed betimes in the morning,<note place="margin">The <hi>Author</hi> like to be taken by the <hi>Tartars</hi>
                        </note> and came, long before night, into the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of the Prince of <hi>Tarku,</hi> where I narrowly escap'd falling into the hands of those Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.
For, hearing that we were not above a quarter of a league from the Sea-side, I left the
Company, taking along with me the Master's Mate, <hi>Cornelius Nicholason,</hi> to go and observe
the situation thereof: but we were hardly got thither, ere we discover'd at a distance two <hi>Tartars,</hi>
follow'd, within two or three hundred paces, by eight more, who, assoon as they perceiv'd
us, made all the haste they could towards us; but we soon recover'd the Road. The two first
seeing us retreat, pursu'd us in full speed, with their Javelins in their hands; till the other
eight, doubting, it seems, that we might not be alone in those parts, got up to a hill, to take
a view of the Country, and seeing all our Company, from which we could not be above a
Musket-shot distant, they call'd to the other two, to give them notice it was in vain to pursue
us. Whereupon, they rode on gently, and came all together to the Company, saluted it,
admir'd our Cloaths, and would needs see our Pistols, but were not permitted to handle
them.</p>
                     <p>We met that day with several parties of <hi>Tartars,</hi> some appearing before us, some behind us.
Some only pass'd by, others accompany'd us a quarter of a league or better. Some try'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we would suffer them to cross us in our march; but we would not permit it.</p>
                     <p>Having travell'd seven leagues that day,<note place="margin">Come to <hi>Tarku.</hi>
                        </note> we came at night before the City of <hi>Tarku,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
without the City, near a Fountain, within a quarter of a league of the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The next day, <hi>Apr.</hi> 17. the Lord of the place sent his Brother, accompany'd by three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of quality, to complement us, and make proffers of his friendship and services.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chan</hi> himself, being sick, could not come in person, which the Ambassadors understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they sent their Physician to him, as well to return their thanks for his civilities, as to offer
his assistance, for the recovery of his health. He made use of him, and found such ease, that
some dayes after, he sent to complement the Ambassadors, and thank them for the care they
had had of him.</p>
                     <p>He was a Lord, of about 38. years of age, named <hi>Surchou Chan,</hi> and pretended himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> with whom he held so good correspondence, that when the
<hi>Dagesthans</hi> are ingag'd in a war amongst themselves, he implores the assistance of the <hi>Schach,</hi>
who fails not to back him. His authority is very considerable among them, yet not so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
but that several <hi>Myrsas,</hi> of his kindred, participate of the Government. Nay he had a
Nephew, a younger Brother's son, who was Lord of some part of the City.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Tarku,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tarku</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Dagest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han.</hi>
                        </note> the Metropolis of all <hi>Dagesthan,</hi> lies within the mountain, between
steepy rocks, which are so full of shells, that they seem to consist of nothing else, there being
not the space of a hands breadth, but a man meets with five or six of them, most, about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Wall-nut-shell. The Rock is as hard as flint, yet is there good pasture upon the top of
the mountain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="304" facs="tcp:47786:186"/>
Out of these Rocks there rise several pleasant springs, which fall into the City several waies.
The City is not wall'd. It may contain a thousand houses, built according to the <hi>Persian</hi> way,
but not so well. These <hi>Tartars,</hi> as also those of <hi>Boinak,</hi> and the others who live more Nort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herly,
are called <hi>Kaitack:</hi> but those who live behind <hi>Tarku,</hi> in the mountain, towards the
West, are named <hi>Kamuk,</hi> or <hi>Kasukumus,</hi> who have, most of them, their particular Lords.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Tarku</hi> are as barbarous &amp; mischievous as those of <hi>Boinak,</hi> but the women
and maids were more civil. They go with their faces uncover'd, and are not kept in such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
as those of the <hi>Persians.</hi> The maids have their hair ty'd up in forty tresses, which hang
down about their heads, and they were not shy of being seen, nor of having their hair felt.</p>
                     <p>We met here with and old man, named <hi>Matthias Magmar,</hi> born at <hi>Ottingen</hi> in the
Dutchy of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A <hi>German</hi> living among the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                        </note> who having left off his trade of weaving, to go into the wars of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
fell into the hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who had sold him to these <hi>Tarters.</hi> He was circumcis'd,
and had almost forgot the <hi>German</hi> tongue; yet he told us he was a <hi>Christian,</hi> and believ'd one
God and three persons. He also said the Lords Prayer, but with much ado.</p>
                     <p>The proffers of friendship and service which <hi>Surchou Chan</hi> made us, had rais'd us into some
confidence, that we were safe under his protection: but we found since, that we were in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
danger there, than we had been any where before. For, during the five weeks we were among
the <hi>Tartars,</hi> all their discourse was of robbing, rifling, killing, and cutting of throats. We
desir'd the <hi>Mehemandar</hi> to go along with us to <hi>Terki,</hi> upon the frontiers of <hi>Moscovy,</hi> or, at
least, to leave us the Camels and other conveniences for carriage, considering the little likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
we had to get any of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and we should requite his kindness with a considerable
sum of mony. But he told us, that he had express order to bring us only to <hi>Tarku,</hi> and that
if he went any further,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors in great danger.</note> it might endanger his life: That we might treat with the Camel-dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and that he would assist us what he could do in it: but instead of obliging us in that, he
took them all along with him that night, unknown to us. This sudden departure of his startled
us the more, in that, the next day, two women, who sold us milk, and pretended to be
<hi>Muscovites</hi> born, and <hi>Christians,</hi> and that they had been stoln away in their yourh, &amp; maried
in that Country, came to tell us, that the <hi>Tartars</hi> intended to kill us all, out of an imagination,
that we carried along with us a vast treasure; That the Inhabitants of <hi>Osmin</hi> and <hi>Boinak</hi> had
sent word to <hi>Surkou Chan,</hi> that we had pass'd through their Country, and that, instead of
paying the duties for our Merchandises and Baggage, we had been so insolent as to threaten them,
and give them ill words: That they had resolv'd to set upon us, to kill all the aged persons,
and make the rest Slaves, and, to that end, had sent Messengers to <hi>Surkou Chan,</hi> and that there
was one gone from him to the <hi>Schemkal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We put the best face outward before those women, and made as if we were not troubled at
any thing the <hi>Tartars</hi> could do, in regard we knew not how far we should credit their relation.
However we thought good to make our advantage of it, upon this reflection, that we found
no order taken for our departure thence, and that there came thither a party of forty <hi>Tartars</hi>
of <hi>Boinak,</hi> &amp; that Messengers pass'd to and fro, as if it were in order to the execution of some
great design.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassadors having call'd together the chief of the retinue, &amp; represented the danger
we were in, put it to the question what were best to be done. It was urg'd, that it had been
more prudence to treat those Barbarians kindly, than to have exasperated them, as had been
done, but since there was no recalling of what was past, that the only way was to take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ell our lives at the dearest rate we could: That, having, on both sides of us, inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible
Rocks, the Sea behind, and the <hi>Tartars</hi> before us, it would be more honourable for
us to dy nobly, than fall alive into the hands of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our greatest misfortune was, that there were differences among our selves. The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<hi>Brugman</hi> carried on his private designs, and found fault with whatever others advis'd, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
those among us who any way pretended to Learning. Certain it is, that, instead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
his endeavours to our preservation, he would have contriv'd our ruin, could he have
done it, without danger to himself.</p>
                     <p>We understood since, that it was really the design of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> to set upon us, and that
they had done it, if the <hi>Schemkal,</hi> out of hopes to have the whole booty himself, and trapann'd
us an other way, had not prevented them. He sent an Express to tell us, that we should take
our way over the Bridge of Boats, above the City of his ordinary residence, &amp; that if we took
any other, even that of the Sea-side, where we might have cross'd the River by Boat, he should
treat us as Enemies.</p>
                     <p>The Messenger he sent us, having concluded his discourse, rose up, and would have been
gone; but the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Ambassador taking him by the arm, said to him; <q>Friend, go and
tell thy <hi>Schemkal,</hi> that he is not to appoint us our way; we shall take that we think fit:
'tis true, it well be no hard matter for him, to cut off a handful of people; but let him know,
that the <hi>Czaar,</hi> who is most concern'd in this Embassy, will resent it, and revenge our
deaths, with the greatest cruelty imaginable.</q> This sharp and resolute answer made the <hi>Tartars</hi>
                        <pb n="305" facs="tcp:47786:186"/>
quit the design they had to set upon us, as they intended, and oblig'd them to change their
manner of proceeding: So that, <hi>Apr.</hi> 20. we were visited by four <hi>Tartar</hi>-Princes, who din'd
with the Ambassadors in their Tent, and were not ill treated, considering the place we were
then at. All their discourse was only of robbing and stealing, and selling men: nay one of them
said that, all the week before, he had stoln but one poor Girl. After they were gone, the
Prince of <hi>Osmin</hi>'s Brother came to visit us. He express'd somewhat of civility, and made us
great proffers of his services. After him, came the <hi>Daruga</hi> of the City of <hi>Tarku.</hi> We ask'd
him, why we were not furnish'd with conveniences of carriadge for our Baggage. He inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
told us,<note place="margin">A Present sent to <hi>Surkou-Chan.</hi>
                        </note> that we were not to expect any, till we had made a Present to <hi>Surkou Chan.</hi>
The next day, there was one sent him, to wit, a pair of gold Bracelers, a pound of Tabacco,
a Pistol, a Firelock, a barel of Powder, two pieces of <hi>Persia</hi>-Satin, and several sorts of Spices,
with this message withall, that a barel of Aquavitae should be sent him, as soon as we came to
<hi>Terki.</hi> This Present took him so, as that he prefently promis'd we should have all conveniences,
for mony,<note place="margin">Who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites them to dinner.</note> and invited the Ambassadors to come and dine with him. It was taken into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
whether they should go, or not; but at last, it was resolv'd they should, taking along
with them four other persons.</p>
                     <p>The cloath was laid upon the ground, according to the <hi>Persian</hi> way, and the whole enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
consisted in four dishes,<note place="margin">Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> wherein there were little slices of Mutton, drawn upon sticks,
some Whitings, and Curds, and in four other lesser dishes, Rice, with pieces of Mutton in
it, and raisins of the Sun. The Carver sate in the middle of the dishes, and having broke a long
thin Cake, he cast a piece of it to every one of the Guests. He also tore the pieces of Meat
and the Fish, but all was done only by his hands, which were as black as his face; so that the
fat running between his fingers, and mingling with the dirt from which it took another colour,
almost turn'd our stomacks.</p>
                     <p>But there was a necessity we should comply. Our drink was only water, in great glasses, and
afterwards Aquavitae, in silver Cups. After dinner, they would needs hear our Musick, which
we sent for; and after a divertisement of three hours, there was meat brought in again. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
among other things, the Liver and Rump of a Sheep, which was all fat, and weigh'd
at least five or six pound.</p>
                     <p>One of the Carvers, (for at this second treatment there were three) minc'd the meat very small,
salted it well, and serv'd every man by handfuls. The meat look'd as if it had been chew'd
before, yet was it not so bad, as against our stomacks. After the treatment, we return'd to
our Quarters.</p>
                     <p>The next day,<note place="margin">Another <hi>Tartaria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </hi> Feast.</note> 
                        <hi>Apr.</hi> 21. one of the other Princes, named <hi>Iman Myrsa,</hi> invited the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to dinner. He was very young, as being not full eighteen years of age, and born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Brother of <hi>Surkou Chan</hi>'s, and a woman, by birth a <hi>Kasamuka.</hi> His Servant told us,
that <hi>Surkou Chan</hi> usurp'd the Principality from him, and that his life was in some danger, by
reason of his Uncle.</p>
                     <p>The cloath was laid in a great Hall, where we sate down, with <hi>Imam Myrsa,</hi> and some
other Lords of the Country, in Chairs, at a low Table. We were better treated, than we
had been the day before, and the Meat was better drest. Among other dishes there was brought
in a whole Lamb roasted, whereof every one carv'd himself what he pleas'd. They used no
knives but tore the Meat in pieces, and I observ'd that when one had left any Meat about the
bone, his next neighbour took it up, and pick'd it, and many times it went to a third and
fourth hand, till at last, he who could find nothing about it would try what there was within,
and get out the marrow.</p>
                     <p>Their drinking Vessels are of Cows-horns, and their drink a sort of liquor called <hi>Bragga,</hi>
which they make of Millet, and, in colour and consistence, looks like the lees of beet. They
think it very delicious, and drink freely of it, as they do also of Aquavitae, and grow of a
sudden so drunk, that notwithstanding the presence of their P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ince, they made such a noise, as
would have drown'd Thunder it self.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> having thus treated us, we took leave of them, well satisfy'd with the cheer
they made us.</p>
                     <p>Some daies after, the Ambassadors were treated by another Prince, named <hi>Emir-Chan,</hi>
who also gave them a visit. But all these <hi>Barbarians</hi> did in this kind, was only to get Presents
from us.</p>
                     <p>The 23. the <hi>Daruga</hi> got us some Waggons for the Baggage. We immediately loaded them,
intending to be gone the next day: but in the evening, <hi>Surchou-Chan</hi> sent us word, that he had
certain intelligence, that <hi>Sultan Mahmud</hi> (so was the <hi>Schemkal</hi> call'd) had possess'd himself of
all the passages of the River <hi>Koisu,</hi> with a design to stop us, and put us to a ransom, and that
hindred him from permitting us to depart.</p>
                     <p>Late in the evening, there came neer <hi>Tarku</hi> twenty horse-men, well mounted aud arm'd, who
encamped close by our Quarters. The Ambassadors, accompany'd by some Musketteers, went
to them, to know whence they came, and what their design was. They made answer, that
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:47786:187"/>
the Prince of <hi>Osmin</hi> had sent them to the <hi>Schemkal,</hi> to tell him that certain forein Ambassadors,
friends of the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and <hi>Czaar</hi> of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> being come into his Territories, he had
suffered them to poss without paying any toll or duties, and to intreat him, to do him the same
favour; which the <hi>Schemkal</hi> had promis'd to do, provided they carried no Merchants goods.
We gave not so much credit to this intelligence, as to neglect keeping a strong Guard, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our Arms in readiness.</p>
                     <p>The 24. these <hi>Tartars</hi> departed before day, and presently after, there came to us, two
Messengers from <hi>Sulthan Mahmud,</hi> who asked the Ambassadors why they did not prosecute
their journey, promising all the favour and assistance lay in his power, for their passage, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they took the way he appointed them. These Messengers were hardly gone, ere <hi>Surkou-Chan</hi>
came to visit us. The Ambassadors asked him, why he hindred their departure, he told
them, that the Horses and Oxen, we had hired, were ready, and that we might be gone when
we pleas'd, giving it him under our hands, how that we would needs depart, notwithstanding
the notice he had given us of the designs of the <hi>Schemkal,</hi> in as much as otherwise he should be
responsible to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and Great Duke of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> for the misfortunes might
happen to us: That he knew the <hi>Schemkal</hi> better than we did: That he car'd for neither God,
nor Devil, nor any forein Prince at all: That he never observ'd his word: That it was his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sport, to rob, and shed blood, and that it were better stay eight dayes longer, within which
time he promis'd us a sufficient Convoy, without which we could not pass through the Prince's
Country, if we resolv'd not to hazard our lives, and lose our Baggage: That ere that time
were expir'd, the <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassador would come thither, with Letters of Commendation
from the King, without which he durst not undertake to convoy us, left he should thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
all the other <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This discourse put us into a great perplexity, considering that the arrival of the <hi>Persian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
was uncertain,<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Terki</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses a Convoy.</note> and that in the mean time, we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ght fear the same thing from <hi>Surchou-Chan,</hi>
which he would have us apprehend from the <hi>Schemkal.</hi> We sent an Express to the <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode</hi>
of <hi>Terki,</hi> to desire him to send us a Convoy of <hi>Strelits,</hi> such as might secure us against the
attempts of the <hi>Tartars;</hi> but he would do nothing. <hi>Surchou-Chan</hi> sent an Express to <hi>Derbent,</hi>
to know of the Ambassador, how long it would be ere he came to <hi>Tarku:</hi> but he sent us word,
some dayes after, that the man he had dispatch'd for <hi>Derbent</hi> was return'd, but had been so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
as to put the Letter, deliver'd him by <hi>Imancnla Sulthan,</hi> into his Quiver, and going to
shoot at a beast by the way, had dropp'd it, so that he had been forc'd to send him back again.
All these proceedings added more and more to our jealousie; but what most startled us, was,
the sudden departure of certain <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants, who having joyn'd with us, out of hopes
of travelling with greater safety in our Company, went into the City, upon notice given them,
that two hundred <hi>Tartars</hi> intended to set upon us. Besides, the inconveniences we endur'd by
reason of ill weather heightned our affliction: for the continual rains had not only sunk through
our Tents and Cloaths, but also hindred us from making any fire, to warm us, and dress our
Meat. No condition, for misery, could be compar'd to that we were then in, forsaken by all,
destitute of all things, even advice and resolution, insomuch that we durst not go into the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
hutts, <hi>Surkou Chan</hi> himself having given us notice, that we might run the hazard of being
carried away and sold. Nay, <hi>Apr.</hi> 27. one of our Soldiers, a Scotchman, named <hi>William Hoye,</hi>
being got a little too far from the Quarters, was carried away by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> so clearly, that
we could never learn any news of him, though we made great inquiry. We heard since, that
he was carried to the Fortress of <hi>Sachur,</hi> within five or six leagues of <hi>Turku.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The same day, there hapned to us another misfortune, in that, some of our people being shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Bows and Arrows, our Canonier, going somewhat near the Mark, to take up an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
was shot into the Belly, whereof he died the next day.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Muscovite,</hi> whose mishap it was to hurt him, had so sensible a remorse of what had
happened, that he desired to be put to death, but the business being taken into consideration, it
was found done by chance without any design; whereupon he was set at liberty. We interr'd
the deceas'd, by the advice of certain <hi>Tartar</hi>-women who were <hi>Christians,</hi> in the place where
our horses stood, and made a Grave without the Quarters, into which was put an empty Coffin,
it being certain that the <hi>Tartars</hi> would, after our departure thence, dig up the Carcass, to give
in their Dogs. There died also a rich <hi>Muscovian</hi> Merchant. His body was inbalm'd, and
brought to <hi>Terki,</hi> where it was buried, in the Church-yard, belonging to those of his Religion.
Amidst all these afflictions and misfortunes, the <hi>Tartars</hi> came every day to get our Musick plaid
upon; which was somewhat like that of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> at the waters of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>May</hi> 1. we dispatch'd a man to <hi>Sulthan Mahmud,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">MAY.</note> to desire passage. Our Messenger return'd
the next day,<note place="margin">The <hi>Schem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kal</hi> grants them pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</note> accompany'd by four <hi>Tartars,</hi> who told us from the <hi>Schemkal,</hi> that he wondred
much to hear, that <hi>Surchou-Chan</hi> would perswade them, he was a famous Robber and faithless
person: that he had given him no cause to dress him in such a Character, and that he should
take occasion to resent it. For us, he proffer'd all his Credit, and his Subjects, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
and safety of our journey; and that if we durst not trust him, he was ready to send
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:47786:187"/>
us three of the principal Lords of the Country as hostages, whom we should either take along
with us, or leave with <hi>Surchou-Chan,</hi> till we were out of his Jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p>These unexpected proffers put us to some difficulty what we should do: but hearing, that
<hi>Sulthan Mahmud</hi> liv'd otherwise than his Father had done, who, having dishonour'd his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
by continual robberies, had reform'd his life, and, to expiate his sins, went on pilgrimage
to <hi>Meca,</hi> and to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Sepulchre, we accepted of his proffers; and that the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
in that the 6. following, we receiv'd Letters from <hi>Derbent,</hi> wherein the <hi>Persian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
sent us word, that being oblig'd to continue there till he had receiv'd his dispatches and
the Interpreter he expected from the Court, and thinking it would be a moneth longer ere he
came to <hi>Tarku,</hi> he left it to our choice, whether we would expect him, or prosecute our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Upon this, we press'd <hi>Surchou-Chan,</hi> to give order for our departure; which he did, after
the receipt of another Present, which he had the boldness to beg himself, and security given, for
the return of the Horses and Oxen, which carried our Baggage, by two of the <hi>Schemkal</hi>'s hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whom we left with him, taking the third along with us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>May</hi> 12. we left <hi>Tarku,</hi> upon the dangerous word of <hi>Sulthan Mahmud.</hi> We had agreed 15.
dayes before with the Waggoners of <hi>Tarku:</hi> but when the Baggage came to be loaden, they fell
from the former agreement, and made us pay much more than we had promis'd them. They
would have done the same for the Saddle-Naggs; but the Ambassadors would not condescend:
which occasion'd some of our people, nay of the chiefest, to foot it, the two first dayes, not
without abuses and jeers from their enemies.</p>
                     <p>We travell'd that day two leagues, through a plain and even Country, but desert, to a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet
which serves for a common Frontier, between <hi>Sulthan Mahmud,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tarku,</hi>
We met by the way certain <hi>Tartar</hi> Lords, who intreated the Ambassadors to lend them our
Physician, to visit one of their friends, who was sick not far thence. The Physician seeming
unwilling to go, out of a fear he should never return, they left two of their Company, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages,
with us, and brought him back after mid-night. All our Supper that night was, only
Bread and troubled Water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>May</hi> 13. being <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> we travell'd four leagues, through a very woody Country.
We thought that day; we should have been left by the way; for the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Ambassador
having cudgell'd one of the Waggoners, all the rest would unteam, and return homewards:
but with much intreaty and fair words we got them to stay. We pass'd over the night in the
Wood, and those who were desirous to sleep, lay down supperless.</p>
                     <p>The 14. we got but one league,<note place="margin">The River <hi>Albanus.</hi>
                        </note> to the River <hi>Koisu,</hi> which, in my opinion must be that which
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> calls <hi>Albanus.</hi> It rises out of mount <hi>Caucasus.</hi> Its Water is thick and troubled, and its
course very swift. It is at least as broad as the <hi>Elbe,</hi> &amp; in that place, it was above twenty foot deep.</p>
                     <p>The Town or Village of <hi>Andre,</hi> where <hi>Sulthan Mahmud</hi> liv'd, stands upon a hill, on this
side of the River. Near the Village, there is a Spring of seething Water, which falls into a
Pool, and makes the water thereof very fit for bathing. The Inhabitants of it are for the most part
Fisher-men, and we saw them in great numbers upon the River-side, about their employment.</p>
                     <p>They thrust a sharp hook baited, which is fasten'd to a long pole, to the bottom of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and by that means take abundance of Sturgeons, and such like fish.</p>
                     <p>I heard they had an odd custom at their Weddings, which is, that all the men bidden thereto
shoot each of them an Arrow into the floor, and leav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> them there, till they either rot, or fall
of themselves, whereof I could never learn any reason.</p>
                     <p>As soon as they perceiv'd us, they came to the River-side; and proffer'd to help us over, and
to facilitate the getting over of the Baggage, they joyn'd two Boats together, over which they
laid a hurdle, strong enough to bear a Wagon. They demanded two Crowns for the passage of
every Wagon, and we had about seventy; and perceiving we made some difficulty to give it
them, and that we chose rather to make a bargain with them for all together, they pass'd over
to the other side, where they fell a jeering and laughing at us. We saw there also the <hi>Schem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kal,</hi>
standing at the entrance of the Wood, accompany'd by a great number of persons on hors-back:
so that we knew not what case we were in.</p>
                     <p>We made hurts of boughs of Trees, upon the River side, and had several private Assemblies,
in regard there was not any publick, in relation to the holy time of Whitsuntide. Such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
Letters met at the Ambassador <hi>Crusius</hi>'s, where we dined, having no other drink than
<hi>Oxicrat,</hi> that is, a beveridge of Vinegar and Water, which was increas'd by the tears we shed,
reflecting on the difference there was, between our present condition, and that we should be in
at our return into our dear Country.</p>
                     <p>The 15. we intreated the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Ambassador to cross the River, which he did, and spoke
to the <hi>Schemkal,</hi> according to the instructions we had given him, and prevail'd so far, that the
<hi>Tartars</hi> were content to take two <hi>Tumains,</hi> which amount not to above forty Crowns, for the
passage of all the Company and the Baggage.</p>
                     <p>VVe cross'd the River the same day, and the Ambassadors immediately caus'd their Tents to
be pitch'd, and fortify'd the Quarter with the Baggage, which was defended by the Artillery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:47786:188"/>
Soon after the <hi>Schemkal,</hi> accompany'd by two of his Brethren, and a retinue of 50. persons
on horse-back, gave them the first visit. He was about 36. years of age, strong, bulky, and of
a good countenance. He had on a Garment of green Satin, over a Coat of mail, and over that
a Cloak, of extreme coarse cloath. His Arms, as also those of the rest of the Company, were
the Cymitar, Bows, and Arrows. Besides a Present of certain Sheep and Lambs, he caus'd
some of his people, to bring thither a great Chauldron, full of Sturgeon, cut into little pieces, and
boil'd in water and Salt, whereto there was a sawce of fresh Butter and Sorrel. I may truly
say, I never made a better meal, and that all the delicates of <hi>Persia</hi> were not comparable to
that dish. The Ambassadors treated him with Aquavitae and Musick, during which our brass
Guns were several times discharg'd. He diverted himself in that manner for the space of two
hours, till that being got half drunk, he withdrew; but return'd again within a white after.</p>
                     <p>We presented him with a pair of gold Bracelets, a silver Goblet, a Scarlet Cloak, lin'd with
Furr, a case of Pistols, a Sword, a barrel of Powder, certain <hi>Persia</hi> silk stuffs, and some Goats-skins
dress'd into leather. He immediately put on the Cloak, and gave his own to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<hi>Brugman,</hi> who had the prudence to humour him, and assure himself of his kindness and
friendship, by putting him in hopes of extraordinary advantages, likely to accrue to him by
settlement of the Commerce, for which he had travell'd so far. He told him, that the <hi>Persian</hi>
Ambassador was to follow them, to conclude with the Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> what they had but
begun in <hi>Persia;</hi> that the said Ambassador would give him further satisfaction as to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and that they should be oblig'd to pass through his Country once a year, with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of great value: That that Country was not known at all in <hi>Germany,</hi> and that their
Prince knew not they were, in those parts, to meet with so great a Lord, otherwise, he had
sent him very considerable Presents; but that it should not be omitted hereafter, and that it
was their intention to make a perpetual friendship with him. This discourse so pleas'd the
<hi>Schemkal,</hi> that he would have hasten'd our departure thence, that we might the sooner return
that way. So that we had horses for the sadle and for carriage at a very easie rate, to carry us
as far as <hi>Terki.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>May</hi> 16.<note place="margin">Leave</note> we departed. He himself, accompany'd by fifty horse, convoy'd us through a
thick Wood, half a league from <hi>Andre,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Andre.</note> where he took leave of us, with much civility. We tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
that day two leagues, over a great Plain, to the River <hi>Aksai.</hi> It runs very slowly in
those parts, and is not above fifty paces broad. The <hi>Tartars</hi> told us, that it is an arm of the
River <hi>Koisu,</hi> into which it falls, near the Sea. There we were forc'd to stay for the Boats, and
the Hurdles, which the Inhabitants of <hi>Andre</hi> brought in Waggons, and in the mean time, we
cut Reeds and Canes, to lay over the mudd which hindred our coming dry to the River side.
We cross'd it by Moon-light, and paid there also two <hi>Tumains</hi> for our passage.</p>
                     <p>Such as were not in favour with the Ambassador <hi>Brugman,</hi> were forc'd to lye down supper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
                     <p>The 17. we travell'd seven leagues, over a great Heath, where we began to be out of sight
of mount <hi>Caucasus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We came at night to the River <hi>Bustro,</hi> and pitch'd our Tents in the adjoyning Forest. This
River is very muddy, and near as big, but not so swift as that of <hi>Koisu.</hi> Running Northward,
about five leagues from the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, it is divided into two branches, whereof one, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
named <hi>Terk,</hi> and now <hi>Timenki,</hi> hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

passes, and is about fifty foot broad.</p>
                     <p>The other branch of the said River is called <hi>Kisilar,</hi> by reason of certain Grains, like Gold,
which come down with its gravel, and the Chanel of it is as broad as that of the other, but hath
so little water, that many times, in the Summer, a man may cross it dry-foot. The mouth of
this arm is eight leagues above the City of <hi>Terki.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is to be observ'd here, that all these Rivers come from the West-north-west, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Kisilar</hi> and the River <hi>Wolga,</hi> which are sixty five leagues distant one from the other,
there is no other River. So that we are to conclude, that the <hi>Aksai,</hi> is the <hi>Coesius</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy;</hi>
that <hi>Bustro,</hi> is the <hi>Gerrus;</hi> that <hi>Timenki,</hi> or <hi>Terk,</hi> is the <hi>Alonta,</hi> and that <hi>Kisilar</hi> is the <hi>Adon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
in as much as there are only these Rivers between the <hi>Albanus</hi> or <hi>Koisu,</hi> and the <hi>Rha,</hi> or
<hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The River <hi>Bustro</hi> is a common Frontier between the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Dagesthan,</hi> and those of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassia;</hi>
upon which accompt it was, that the Waggoners of <hi>Tarku,</hi> would not go beyond it.</p>

particular, that we left, on the other side of the River, the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and were
entred into <hi>Christendom.</hi> For though the <hi>Tartars</hi> of these parts are also <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Prince, who is the Great Duke of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and hath, at all places, his Governours, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
and Priests, for the exercise of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion.</p>
                     <p>Provisions were so dear in these parts, that we were forc'd to pay above thirty shillings for a
Sheep. Nay they would not spare us many; so that to get flesh, we went into the Woods and
shot at Crows, whereof there were abundance thereabouts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:47786:188"/>
The 19. we travell'd five leagues, through a plain Country, full of Reeds, having also
some few trees, which were, for the most part, planted round about a great Plain.</p>
                     <p>At night we encamped upon the Heath, neer a Well, or rather a Sink, in regard the water
of it was so corrupt, that the very Beasts would not drink of it. The ground thereabouts was
all full of holes, which the Serpents and Snakes had made there; and yet, though we were
forc'd to lodge on the ground, not one of us receiv'd any harm.</p>
                     <p>The 20. we got four leagues further, over heathy and barren Lands, to the City of <hi>Terki.</hi>
We saw that day a great many Serpents, many whereof where as big as a man's arm, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
six foot in length. They lay round, and sported themselves in the heat of the Sun, which
gave a delightful lustre to the liveliness of the colours, wherewith their skins were spotted all
over. We saw also, neer <hi>Terki,</hi> a kind of <hi>Field-mice,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Serpent. <hi>Jerbuah,</hi> a kind of Field-Mouse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> which, in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Language, are
called <hi>Ierbuah.</hi> They are about the bigness of a Squirrel, and somewhat like the Creature of
that kind which is so common in <hi>Europe,</hi> save that their hair is blacker, their heads like those
of Rats, they have long ears, the fore-feet short, and the hinder feet long; whence it comes,
that they cannot run, but when they get up some place, and, in the plain, they only creep,
unless it be, when thy leap, for then they spring five or six foot high from the ground, having
their tails layd over their backs. And whereas their tails are long, and without any hair, like
those of ordinary Mice, but not so big, they are somewhat like the Lions Rampant, in Coats
of Arms: and they made a pretty kind of sport, especially when many of them leap'd at the
same time, as we said before. They say, there are abundance of them about <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in
<hi>Arabia,</hi> where the Inhabitants eat them. Some will leave the field, and go into peoples houses;
which if they do, the master of the house had need have a care of his money, left they light

                     <p>The <hi>Persian,</hi> whom I brought out of the Country, and who still waits on me, named <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wordi,</hi>
told me a story, how that his Father having observ'd that his mony was, from time
time, taken out of his Chamber, at first suspected his Wife and Children, till, one day finding
there one of these <hi>Ierbuah,</hi> he presently imagin'd who playd the Thief: but to be assur'd of it,
he set an <hi>Abas</hi> upon the Table, and, going out of the room, lock'd the door, so that no
other could get in, and coming thither a while after, the <hi>Abas</hi> was gone, whereupon search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nest of that Creature, he found in it more mony than he had lost.</p>
                     <p>Within a quarter of a league of the City of <hi>Terki,</hi> came up to us a Brother of Prince <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi>'s,
of whom we have spoken heretofore, accompany'd by a Colonel, whom the <hi>Weywode</hi>
sent to meet and complement us. He receiv'd us in Tents, pitch'd without the City, where
we had a Collation of Ginger-bread, Beer, Hydromel, and Aquavitae. During our stay there,
there were Lodgings taken up for us in the City.</p>
                     <p>The next day, the <hi>Weywode</hi> sent the Ambassadors four dishes of Meat, for their wellcom
thither. The Ambassadors sent to visit the Princess <hi>Bika, Mussal</hi>'s Mother, and, some dayes
after, went to her in person. They din'd with her. Now was our joy compleat, to find our
selves out of the power of the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Dagesthan,</hi> and among the <hi>Moscovites,</hi> who were
our friends and acquaintance, which made us send for our Musick to divert our selves at Prince

their cheeks well colour'd. Their hair, which is black, hangs down in two tresses, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sides of their faces, which are never cover'd. They wear about their heads a black Coif, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with a piece of very fine Cotton, or some other wrought linnen cloath, which they ty

                     <p>The Widdows have hanging behind in their necks an Ox bladder,<note place="margin">Women</note> fully blown, cover'd
with a piece of Cotton, Lawn, or some other stuff of several colours, so that at a distance,
they seem to have two heads. The Women, in Summer wear only a smock, which is red,
green, yellow, or blew, cut so deep before, that a man may see all down to their Navels.</p>
                     <p>They were very familiar, and of a very good humour. The first day after ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> arrival, four
of them came to us, in a stately gate, aud with such a confidence, as the Poets attribnte to
the <hi>Amazons,</hi> whom they place in or neer these parts. They stai'd us, and would not let us
go, till they had taken particular notice of all things about us. Nor were they on the other side
so shy, as to take it ill, that some of ours, who pretended to handle the beads of amber and
shells, or necklaces of Tinn or Copper, which they wear about their necks, slipp'd their hands
down into their bosoms. Some invited us to their houses, and we were told, it was the custom
of the Country, that the husband, seeing any one going to his house, to speak with his wife,
should, to avoid being troublesome, go out of doors, and leave them together. Though the
men are seldome at home, as being all day busied in the fields, about their Cattel, yet do they
relate miracles of the chastity of these women.</p>
                     <p>One I have to this purpose from a Military Officer of ours,<note place="margin">Are Chaste.</note> who being got into one of their
houses; and finding the woman handsome, grew familiar with her, and found her very willing
to do him any little kindness that lay in her power, even to make him Handkerchers, &amp; wash
his head: so that, thinking the fort as good as taken, he would try how much longer she could
stand out. But she told him there was no such thing done among them; that the confidence
their husbands had of their honesty, requir'd they should be as faithful on their parts; nay that
though their husbands might connive at such a miscarriadge, yet would not the rest of the people
pass by an inconstancy of that nature. They made no difficulty to endure any thing else, and
would be paid for it, taking and begging Presents, nay under pretence of visiting our cloaths
all about, they sometimes put their hands into our pockets, and took out what they could
light on.</p>
                     <p>Though it be lawful among them, for men to marry several wives, yet most content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with one. When a man dies without issue, his Brother is oblig'd to marry the widdow,
to raise up seed to him; and according to this custom, the <hi>Mussal</hi> had married his Brothers
widdow.</p>
                     <p>Their Religion is in a manner Pagan;<note place="margin">Their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> for though they are circumcis'd, yet have they neither
Bible, nor Alchoran, nor Priests, nor Churches. They are themselves the Priests, and offer
the Sacrifices, especially on the day of St. <hi>Elias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When a person of quality dies the relations and friends meet in the fields,<note place="margin">Their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</note> both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to sacrifize a he-Goat; and to find whether it be fit to sacrifize, they cut off the privy
members, which they cast against the wall: if they do not stick thereto, they are oblig'd to
kill another, but if they do, they proceed with the Ceremonies, fleaing it, and stretching the
skin upon the top of a long pole, before which they offer their sacrifice, and boil, and roast the
Flesh, which they afterwards eat. The Feast ended, the men rise, and go and adore the skin, and
the prayers concluded, the women withdraw. The men stay, and grow so bestially drunk, with
their <hi>Bragga,</hi> or <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> that they seldom part without fighting. This skin is left upon the
pole, till another person of quality dies, and then the former is taken away, and another set up
instead of it.</p>
                     <p>We saw neer <hi>Terki,</hi> both going and coming, not far from the Princess <hi>Bika</hi>'s house, one
of these stretch'd skins, with the head and the horns on, upon the black cross. The pole was
planted in a quick-set hedge, only to keep the Dogs from coming neer it, and, by their pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
against it, profaning the Mystery.</p>
                     <p>They interr their dead very honourably;<note place="margin">Their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terments.</note> adorn their Sepulchres with pillars, and build hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
over those of persons of quality. We saw one over the Sepulchre of <hi>Mussal</hi>'s Brother, the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:47786:189"/>
boards whereof were of diverse colours, plac'd checquerwise, having, upon the roof, several
wooden Statues, poorly done, which represented the hunting of some wild Beast.</p>
                     <p>To express their sorrow for the departure of their friends, they tear their forehead, arms,
and breasts, with their nails, after a barbarous manner, so that the blood comes out in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
Their mourning continues till the wounds are healed, and if they would have it last lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
they renew, them, by opening the scratches in the same manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>May.</hi> 21. we began to set things in order, for the prosecution of our journey. We had a
Desert of seventy leagues to travel over, and, to find horses for all the Company to ride, would
have been too great an expence. Wherefore we agreed with the Waggoners of <hi>Terki,</hi> at nine
Crowns a Wagon, drawn by two horses, which might carry each of them three or four per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to <hi>Astrachan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There joyned with us a <hi>Caravan</hi> of Merchants, of several Nations, as <hi>Persians, Turks,
Greeks, Armenians,</hi> and <hi>Muscovites;</hi> so that then we had above two hundred Wagons,
in our Company. But the Provisions allow'd us were but small for so great a journey: to wit,
to every man, with the <hi>Suchari,</hi> and a loaf of mouldy brown bread, half a dry'd Salmon that
stunk, without any drink. For the <hi>Tartars,</hi> pretending they had bargain'd only for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riadge
of men, would not receive any barrels or other vessels into the Wagons, and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
<hi>Brugman</hi> would not be at the charge of a Wagon, purposely to carry beer or water
for us, though he made good provision of all for himself and his Favourites. And indeed we
stood not much upon it, out of an imagination, it was impossible, we should want water: but
we had time enough to repent us of that presumption.</p>
                     <p>We left <hi>Terki,</hi> the fourth of <hi>Iune,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">JUNE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> in the afternoon, and soon entred into that dreadful
Heath,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bass. leave <hi>Terki.</hi>
                        </note> taking our way on the left hand, and turning from the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. 'Tis a thing strange,
yet very certain, that, in eleven daies journey, we saw neither City, nor Village, nor tree,
nor hill, nor any River but that of <hi>Kisilar,</hi> contrary to what all Maps represent thereof.<note place="margin">The Deserts of <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan.</hi>
                        </note> Nay,
during all that time, we saw not so much as one Bird, but only a vast Plain, desert, sandy,
and cover'd in some places with a little grass, and pits, or standing pooles, of salt, or corrupt
and stinking water. We got the first day but two leagues, and lodg'd at night, neer one of
those standing pools.</p>
                     <p>The 5. we encamped neer the River <hi>Kisilar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 6. we travell'd six leagues, and lodg'd neer one of those pools. These three first daies,
we took our way towards the <hi>West-north-west,</hi> and <hi>East-north-east,</hi> to the River <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 7. we got six leagues further, through a great Fenn, which we had much ado to pass.
Heat and thirst troubled us extremely, but not so much as the Flies, Wasps, Gnats, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
infects, which both men and horses found it no small difficulty to keep off. The Camels,
which have no tails, to keep away those infects, as the horses have, were all bloody, and full
of swellings.</p>
                     <p>The 8. we were going before day; and having travell'd 4. leagues, we gave our horses a
little rest and provender, at the entrance of a very sandy road. In the afternoon, we got four
leagues further, and lodg'd at night, neer a standing pool. The <hi>Tartars</hi> perceiving that one of
their horses was like to miscarry by the way, prevented him, cut his throat, and shar'd him
among themselves. At night they roasted him, making a fire of little bushes of thorns and reeds,
and were very merry.</p>
                     <p>The 9. we travell'd seven leagues, and lodg'd, neer a pool which the overflowing of the Sea
made thereabouts. The water was so bad, as was also that of all the rest, that we were forc'd
to stop our noses while we drunk it.</p>
                     <p>The 10. we got seven leagues further, to a place cover'd with Reeds, where we found a little
fresh water, deriv'd thither from the <hi>Wolga.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 11. we got seven leagues further, to a standing pool, made there by the inundation of
the <hi>Wolga.</hi> The water is not salt, but so dead and stinking, that there was no drinking of it.
That day, twelve great wild Boars cross'd out way. Some <hi>Tartars</hi> on horse-back came riding
after them, and as ill fortune would have it, there came two of them close by our Waggon.
The horses were frightned, and fell a-running, so that the Physician and Steward fell out of
the Waggon, with the Baggage. The Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Waggon, considering there was no getting out without danger, kept our places, till the
horses, being not able to go any further, stopp'd at the entrance of a Fenn.</p>
                     <p>The 12. we travell'd eight leagues, and found, in our way, upon the ground, a Neast,
wherein there were two Birds not quite fledg'd Some were of opinion they were young Eagles.
VVe pass'd by two salt marshes, the scent whereof was somewhat like that of a Violet, and
very delightful.</p>
                     <p>The 13. we travell'd eight leagues further, lodg'd at night in a place, whence we could disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the City of <hi>Astrachan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 14. we got three leagues, and lodg'd on the side of the <hi>Wolga,</hi> over against <hi>Astrachan.</hi>
All our people who had not drunk any fresh water, since their coming from <hi>Terki,</hi> ran up to
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:47786:190"/>
their knees in the River, to drink with greater ease. Assoon as they had notice at <hi>Astrachan</hi> of
our arrival, they presently came to visit us, and he who had the keeping of the Provisions sent
thither for us, brought us a sack full of bread, Neats-tongues, hung-Beef, a tun of Beer, and
a barrel of Aquavitae. We continu'd that day on the River-side, to give the <hi>Weywode</hi> time to
assign us Lodgings.</p>

                        <hi>Iune</hi> 14. we cross'd the River <hi>Wolga,</hi> and were lodg'd in a great <hi>Ambara,</hi> or
Store-house, built there not long before, upon the River side, without the City, where we
were much troubled with Flies. We found there also another Store-house, full of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
which <hi>David Ruts,</hi> his Highness's Factor at <hi>Moscou,</hi> had sent thither six months
before.</p>
                     <p>The Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> would have had all the Baggage dispos'd into an appartment by it
self, intending to have it search'd, and to that purpose, had open'd some Chests: but those of
the retinue who had not put off either cloaths or linnen, since their departure from <hi>Terki,</hi> were
so incens'd at this procedure, that they broke into the Room, and carried away their Chests,
notwithstanding the order he had given the Sentinel, plac'd at the door, to keep any from
getting in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iune</hi> the last, the Ambassadors sent their Presents to the <hi>Weywode,</hi> who return'd them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Present, of four Sheep, an Ox, ten wild Ducks, ten Pullets, six Geese, a runn of Beer,
and another of Hydromel.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true,<note place="margin">JULY.</note> the Ambassadors dined and supp'd together, during our aboad at <hi>Astrachan;</hi> but
there was not a word spoken at Table, unless it were when the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> was pleas'd
to fall on any with his ordinary Language which was picquant and satyrical enough. One day
he gave such bitter expressions, to the Secretary of the Embassy, that he could not forbear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him some answer, whereat the other was so enrag'd, that he drew his knife at him, and
made him rise from the Table, with such injurious words, that the Secretary, at his return
into <hi>Holstein,</hi> was oblig'd to make his complaints thereof, to the Magistrate, who condemn'd
<hi>Brugman</hi> to make publick satisfaction. This ill correspondence, and al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>enation of minds, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
chiefly from <hi>Brugman</hi>'s being conscious to himself, of the many imprudent actions he
had done in our Travels, and the fear he was in to be punish'd, for those disorders, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>Holstein,</hi> upon the prosecution of those, who had taken particular notice, and the
freedom many times, to mind him thereof.</p>
                     <p>This aversion of his reach'd even to the Minister, who being oblig'd, by the duty of his
Profession, severely to reprove the sins committed in the Company, had incurr'd <hi>Brugman</hi>'s
displeasure in so high a manner, that he could not get of him to buy a suit of cloaths, in so
much, that, being, on some great Festival, to preach and administer the Sacrament at <hi>Scama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi>
it was found he had only a pair of Drawers under his Cassock, to the great scandal of all,
but particularly the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Ambassador, who liked our Liturgy, and would have given the
Minister a suit of cloaths, had he not stood in fear of the indignation and violence of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
<hi>Brugman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We understood also,<note place="margin">A perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of one of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.</note> that he had a design to leave <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and to go by land, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
by some of his own Creatures, and to forsake the rest of the Company. The <hi>Muscovian</hi>
Ambassador, to whom he had communicated it, discovered it to us, and gave us notice, that
we should observe his actions, in as much as his intention was no better than that of <hi>Rous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi>
who had betray'd the Marquess of <hi>Exidueil,</hi> and caus'd him to be sent prisoner into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria.</hi>

from some friends, giving him to understand that he would not be well receiv'd by the Great
Duke, he went no further, but there took a dose of poison, whereof he died.</p>

                        <hi>Iuly</hi> 25. came to <hi>Astrachan,</hi> a <hi>Muscovian Caravan,</hi> and, with it, a <hi>German,</hi> named <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
Reusner,</hi> who had Letters of recommendation from his Highness of <hi>Holstein</hi> to the King

                     <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> must also needs fall out with the Musketteers, who guarded them. Cudgels and

his people, was going to draw upon them, when our Ambassadors came in, and reconcil'd
all.</p>

at <hi>Moscou,</hi> was Counsellor of State to the Great Duke, receiv'd us but very indifferently,
as well in regard the Ambassadors had not made their acquaintance with him by Presents, as by
reason of his siding with the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Merchants, who opposed our negotiation, and would
have prevented the establishment of our Commerce. The Ambassadors sent their Steward to
him, with the Great Duke's pass, intreating him they might be assigned Lodgings in the City;
but he sent him back with this answer, that he might return to the Boat, and there the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
should hear further from him.</p>
                     <p>The next day, he sent to the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi>'s Boat, a <hi>Sinbojar,</hi> who addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Ambassador, ask'd him, which of the two was the Ambassador, which the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.
<hi>Brugman,</hi> thinking himself affronted by that discourse, took him by the arm, and said
to him, Go tell thy Master, that if he cannot read, let him get one that can, and withall
may shew him, what quality the Great Duke gives us. But notwithstanding all this, we were
forc'd to continue several daies on the River, though the weather were very cold. The <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode</hi>
indeed sent us word, that we might lodge in the City for our money; but he issu'd out
orders, that none should entertain us, and commanded the Sentinel, who had permitted the
Steward to pass, and a Boy, who had been his guide through the marsh, from the River-side
to the City, to be cudgell'd.</p>

                        <hi>Nov.</hi> 11. the <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassador made his entrance into the City, and was lodg'd in that
part of it which is bult of wood. He prevail'd so far with the <hi>Weywode,</hi> that he permitted us
to land, which we did the 13. taking up our Quarters in the Suburbs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nov.</hi> 20. the Ambassadors bestow'd the two Boats on the <hi>Weywode,</hi> and made him some other

                        <hi>December</hi> the 16. the <hi>Muscovites</hi> celebrated the Festival of their Patron,<note place="margin">DECEM.</note> St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> for
the space of eight daies together, during which a man could see nothing but perpetual drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
and extraordinary bebauchdness, in both men and women. The <hi>Care</hi> or Parson of
the Parish, came one day to my Quarters, accompany'd by his Clerk, as well to incense
the Images, as to comfort the Mistress of the house, whose husband was put in prison for
debt.</p>
                     <p>He told us, that, about forty years before, there had been found in the Monastery of <hi>Spas,</hi>
which is in the said City of <hi>Casan,</hi> the bodies of two Monks, named <hi>Warsinosi,</hi> and <hi>Kursi,</hi>
whose sanctity was approved, not only, in that their bodies had been found entire, after so
many years, but also by the many miracles they did, there being no sick person but recover'd
his health, after he had done his devotions at their Sepulchre. I ask'd him, why he complain'd
of his back, and how it came to pass, there were so many blind people, and so great a number
of other sick persons at <hi>Casan.</hi> The Priest had not a word to say, but grew angry, and went
his way.</p>
                     <p>Having stay'd at <hi>Casan</hi> five weeks,<note place="margin">Leave Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san.</note> till the Ice and snow were able to bear, we departed thence,

                        <hi>Christ-mass</hi> day, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper might be administred that day: but
the Ambassador <hi>Brugman</hi> was against it, and order'd our departure thence on the 23. in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
qnitting the <hi>Wolga,</hi> to take our way by the River <hi>Occa,</hi> which was also frozen up.</p>
                     <p>The 25. we had a Sermon, at two in the morning, at a Village named <hi>Kurim,</hi> ten leagues
from <hi>Nise,</hi> and travell'd that day ten leagues further.</p>

                        <hi>December</hi> the last, we came to a Village, named <hi>Rubossa,</hi> within eight leagues of <hi>Moscou,</hi>
where our <hi>Pristaf,</hi> who had gone before, to acquaint the Great Duke with our arrival, came
and told us, that, within two daies we should make our entrance into <hi>Moscou.</hi> The Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
<hi>Brugman</hi> fell into such a peevish humour at this place, that he threatned some of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to have their noses and ears cut off, assoon as he were come into the Frontters of <hi>Germany.</hi>
But his menaces troubled no body, nor did so much as any one offer to run away.</p>

                  <p>YOu have here the Travels of a young Gentleman,
who went along with the Embassie, sent by the
Duke of <hi>Holstein,</hi> into <hi>Muscovy</hi> and <hi>Persia.</hi> That
it was his resolution to see the other parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> appear'd
by the express permission he obtain'd from his own Prince,
before his departure, to do it. For the particular descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we have of <hi>Persia,</hi> we are indebted to <hi>Adam Olearius,</hi>
the Author of the Ambassadours Travels into <hi>Muscovy</hi>
and <hi>Persia,</hi> which I dare affirm to be such as is infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
ought came abroad of that part of the World before.
What our present Author <hi>Mandelslo</hi> gives of it, is only
what lay in his way between <hi>Ispahan</hi> and the City of <hi>Ormuz.</hi>
But of his departure from the former, the motives upon
which he went, and the assistances he receiv'd from some of
this Nation, be pleased to receive this account.</p>
                  <p>His acquaintainces with some <hi>English</hi> Merchants at <hi>Ispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi>
the Metropolis of <hi>Persia,</hi> heightned in him the design
of these Travels into the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> their recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
conducted him first to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and afterwards thence to
<hi>Surat.</hi> The kindnesses he receiv'd from the <hi>English</hi> Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and other Merchants he met with there, were such, as
not only ingag'd his stay some time, but also found him the
conveniences of divers Caravans, with whom he travell'd
into several parts of the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, and particularly
to the Court of that powerful Prince, where he had staid
longer, had not an accident, which happened at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of the Embassy, occasion'd in his sudden remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
<pb facs="tcp:47786:194"/>
thence. But what further Observations he might have
made of those parts, are supply'd not only by the said <hi>Olea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
but also by the person who rendred his Work into the
<hi>French,</hi> out of which, as being the most compleat, this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
into the <hi>English</hi> is done. Having continu'd among
the <hi>English</hi> Merchants at <hi>Surat,</hi> till the Ships bound for
<hi>England</hi> were ready for their departure, he comes thence,
along with Master <hi>Methwold,</hi> who had newly resigned his
charge of President to Mr. <hi>Fremling,</hi> at the Ceremonies
whereof he was present. Being come to <hi>London,</hi> he found
the same person, and others of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company as
liberal of their kindness and hospitality, as they had been in
those parts where he grew first acquainted with them; and
such they continued, till his desires to wait on his own
Prince, and put a Period to his Travels, occasioned his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into his own Country.</p>
                  <p>The civilities and endearments he receiv'd from them,
were indeed such, as not only, then, oblig'd the Person, to
whom they were shewn, but have, since, engag'd all those
who have made any advantage of the Travels occasion'd
thereby. It was therefore a noble and necessary gratitude in
the Author, to make the frequent acknowledgments he does
thereof in several places of his Work. It was a commendable
compliance with his humour, in those who put it into other
Languages, to propose both, as examples to their Countries.
But for my part, I conceive there lies the greater Obligation
upon me to make this address of my Labours herein, in that
I am to let the World know, whose incouragements it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to for these Travels, and to celebrate in our own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
and Country what was so nobly and generously done
by some of your illustrious body in the more remote parts
of the Universe, and shew withall what induc'd me to this
presumption of assuming the quality of,</p>

                        </hi> loves him, and offers bin a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of 10000. Crowns.</note> that that Monarch
press'd him to stay there for some years, and to that end profferd him many great
advantages, and among others, a Pension of five or six hundred <hi>Tumains,</hi> which
amount to near 10000. Crowns; many of the greatest about the Court, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the King had an affection for him, courted his Friendship, and, one after
another, entertain'd him with continual Feasting, out of a hope to engage him in
the heat of Wine, and by such great expressions of their kindness towards him.
Those who were the most importunate with him, (and to that end appointed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
meetings, whereat they gave him all the divertisements which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to forget the inclinations he had towards his own Countrey) were the
Master of the Horse,<note place="margin">He considers whether he were best stay at <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
                     </note> the great Faulconer, and the high Steward. They could not
absolutely prevail with him, but shook his resolution so, as that he went and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
with the Prior of the <hi>Italian Carmelites,</hi> a person that by the abode of
twenty four years at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> was perfectly acquainted with the Court of <hi>Persia.</hi>
This good religious man, who was called Father <hi>Tinas,</hi> a person of eminent vertue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
told him, that to put him out of the perplexity he was in, he would alledge unto
him two instances, whereby he might himself judge, what fortune he was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
in <hi>Persia.</hi> One was, that he had known a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, who had so
well establish'd himself in the Court, that the King, who had employed him in two
great Embassies of great importance into <hi>Europe,</hi> which he very faithfully m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
had, to oblige him to spend the rest of his dayes in <hi>Persia,</hi> prevailed with
him to marry a <hi>Persian</hi> Lady, but allowing him the freedom to live according
to his own Religion. That some years afterwards, this Gentleman desired leave
to return into <hi>France,</hi> but the King forbad him to depart the Kingdom; and to
<pb facs="tcp:47786:195"/>
prevent him from attempting it, caused all he had to be seized upon. That, even
that unkindness had not smothered in him the desire he had to return into
<hi>France,</hi> so that he made his escape notwithstanding that prohibition; but he
was killed by the way. That his Lady, who had received Baptism, fled into the
Monastery of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> where she lay concealed, till she had an opportunity
to disguise her self, and to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> whither the Pope had invited her. The
other Story was, that another Gentleman, an <hi>Italian,</hi> of the house of the <hi>Gabrieli,</hi>
who was no less favoured at the Court then the <hi>French</hi> man, growing weary of
living so long among <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> the professed enemies of his Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
him to make a discovery to the King, of some notice he had, that there
were about <hi>Ormus</hi> certain Mines, out of which Gold might be gotten, and shewed
him a sample of it. The King did not so absolutely credit him, but that he
sent along divers Lords and Gentlemen, who were to observe him: but coming to
<hi>Gamron,</hi> he made them so drunk with Sack, which the <hi>Portuguese</hi> had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
him with, that he made a shift to get to the Sea-side, where finding a
Boat ready, he made his escape to <hi>Ormus.</hi> That this escape of his had so incens'd
the King, that it raised in <hi>Schach-Abas</hi> the first thoughts of besieging the City
of <hi>Ormus,</hi> which he reduced to his obedience the year following.</p>
                  <p>To this the good Father added, that he had several other reasons to give him,
which might divert a Gentleman of his age, and one so handsome in person, from
staying in so depraved a Court as that of <hi>Persia:</hi> but that he conceived M.
<hi>Mandelslo</hi> himself was better acquainted with it, then to engage him in a
discourse of that nature. And indeed what he had said was enough to settle
his resolution, so that before they parted, <hi>Mandelslo</hi> promised him to leave <hi>Ispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi>
with the soonest, and prosecute his design of going to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and thence
to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whence he made account to go to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and to return by the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi>
Sea into <hi>Europe.</hi> But having understood that the Grand Seigneur
had besieged <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> he changed his resolution, and took that of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Ormus,</hi> and thence to the Great <hi>Mogul's</hi> Court, and so into the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that end having disingaged himself from the Embassadours on the one and
twentieth of <hi>December</hi> 1637. he stayed at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> till the 16. of <hi>January</hi>
following. But in regard he himself hath taken the pains to set down the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of his Travels, and to make a very exact relation thereof, it were an injury
to him, not to let him speak himself. He begins his relation thus.</p>

the Duke my Master had given me, and having taken my leave
of the Embassadours two Leagues thence, I returned to the
City, where I stayed almost a month, to put all things in order
for the prosecution of my Design. During which time the
King ordered <hi>Imanculi Esichagasi,</hi> a Native of <hi>Karabath,</hi> to

were valued by the <hi>Persians,</hi> to 1500. Tumains, which make 20000. Crowns.</p>
                  <p>They about the Court, who had express'd a kindness for me, perceiving I was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd

Soliman,</hi> by reason of a sumptuous Sepulchre, which is within half a league of it. The
Sepulchre is in a little Chappel built of white Marble, upon a high square of free-stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
so as that the going up to its is by steps of all sides. The air and rain have eaten into
the wall, in several places, but time hath in a manner consumed several great pillars of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
whereof what remains may be seen all about the Structure: upon the wall of the
Chappel there are yet to be seen in <hi>Arabian</hi> Characters these words, <hi>Mader Suleiman.</hi> The
Inhabitants say, that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Mother was interr'd there; but the <hi>Carmelite</hi> Fathers of
<hi>Schiras,</hi> with more likelihood of truth, told me, that it was the Sepulchre of the Mother of
<hi>Scach Soliman,</hi> the 14. Calif, or King, of the posterity of <hi>Aaly. Elmacin,</hi> in his History
of <hi>Arabia,</hi> l. 1. c. 14. sayes, her name was <hi>Wallada,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Abbas Abbasceam,</hi>

one day in a Looking-glass, said, that he might justly assume the quality of King of
Youth, as well as of his Kingdom; whereto one of the Seraglio-Ladies answered, that he
might indeed justly do it, if his beauty would continue still the same, and were not subject
to that change which is natural and common to all things; but that he must consider with
himself that it was perishable, and that happily he should not enjoy it long; and that these
words made such an impression in him, that, failing into a deep melancholy, he within a few

This last Village is very famous, for the Antiquities which are to be seen near it, and which
obliged us, as they do all that travel that way, to make a particular Observation thereof.
They are the ruines of an old Castle,<note place="margin">Tzilminar.</note> which the <hi>Persians,</hi> call <hi>Tzilminar,</hi> that is to say, <hi>forty
pillars</hi> from a word compounded of <hi>Tezehil,</hi> which signifies 40. and <hi>minar,</hi> a pillar or
Tower; in as much as the towers of the <hi>Metschid</hi> or <hi>Mosqueys</hi> of the <hi>Persians,</hi> having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bells nor steeples, are of the form and bigness of a pillar. They are no doubt the ruines
of one of the most magnificent structures that ever were; and the <hi>Persians</hi> say, that their
King <hi>Szemscid Padschal,</hi> Grand-father by the mother side to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, (of
whom mention is made in the precedent Travels of the Embassadours into <hi>Muscovy</hi> and
<hi>Persia</hi>) was the Founder of that Castle; though others say King <hi>Solomon</hi> built it; and
some would have it done by <hi>Darius,</hi> the last King of <hi>Persia.</hi> The Religious men of <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
told me,<note place="margin">Persepolis</note> that the learned were clearly of opinion, that the ancient <hi>Persepolis</hi> had stood
thereabouts, and that these were the ruines of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Palace. Whatever they were, they
are at this day such as would ravish those who can ever so meanly judge of the excellency
of ancient Monuments. The Ground-work of it is twenty two Geometrical feet in
height, having at each of the four corners a pair of stairs of white Marble, consisting of
95. steps, which are very flat, and so broad, that twelve horse may go up together a-breast.
Upon the square of it, before you come within the structure, may be seen the ruines of
a wall, as also what is left of two great Gates, which have catv'd upon them each a horse,
with harness and saddles very antick; and in the two other pieces, two creatures, whereof
the hinder part hath some resemblance to the body of a horse, but the head, which is
crowned, resembles that of a Lion, and both have wings of each side. On the one side, there
are nineteen pillars of black and white Marble, whereof the least were eight, the biggest

                     </gap>els high, without the bases. They told us, that not long before there were forty pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
standing; but it cannot be well judg'd, whether they had been design'd for the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of some great Hall; or set there in the air purely for show. A little further are the
ruin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of two chambers, which, as far as may be judg'd by the doors and windows, were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47786:196"/>
not very large. All is of Marble, so smooth and polish'd, that it might serve for a Looking-glass,
as well as that of the palace Royal at <hi>Ispahan.</hi> On both sides of the doors, there are
several figures of men, carved, whereof some are sitting, others stand, but much exceeding
the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tural proportion. They have all their hair so long, that it falls down over their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
great beards, and habits falling down to their heels, with very wide sleeves, and a gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
about their garments. They have all round caps upon their heads; which, being much
different from the ordinary habit of the <hi>Persians</hi> at present, argues a great antiquity. At
a small distance, there are two other Chambers, built after the same manner, and of the
same bigness, whereof there is nothing left but the doors, and the cross-bars of the
windows.</p>
                  <p>The structure seems to have had many doors, which the <hi>Persians</hi> observe to this day in
their buildings, so to make way for the winds they stand in need of to cool themselves.
Near these chambers there may be seen, engraven upon a square pillar, certain unknown
characters, which have nothing common with either the <hi>Greek, Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Arabian,</hi> nor
indeed with any other language. There are twelve lines of these characters, which, as to
their figure, are triangular, Piramidal, or like obelisques, but so well graven and so propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate,
that those who did them cannot be thought Barbarians: Some believe they are
<hi>Telesmes,</hi> and that they contain some secrets which Time will discover. Besides these,
there is also a great Court, upon the same ground-work, which is ninety paces square,
having on each side two gates, whereof some are six, others but three paces wide, all built
of a very well polish'd marble, whereof the several pieces are eight foot in length and
three in breadth. In another Court there are represented in carv'd-work, in marble, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
triumphs, and Olympick games, very well done, and with an exact observance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
Upon every gate is represented a man, with a graceful countenance, sitting, and
holding in one hand a Globe, in the other a Scepter, though the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> never sate
in that posture. I had the curiosity to get up on high, where I found the figure of a King
at his devotions, adoring the Sun, Fire, and a Serpent. It is not easie to affirm, whether
the Architecture of this Palace be of the <hi>Ionick, Dorick,</hi> or <hi>Corinthian</hi> order, the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is so ruin'd, though there be yet as much left as would find work for a good able
Painter for six months. 'Tis a thousand pities, that no body hath yet had the curiosity to

the City had been much bigger then it is now, though there be in it at present above ten
thousand houses; which I the more easily credited, in that we found all about it, and
half a league beyond, the ruines of the gates and walls of a great City. Whatever Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
supplies mankind withall, not only for necessity, but also for pleasure, is here to be had
in great abundance; as Wheat, Wine, Oranges, Lemmons, Pomegranats, Almonds, Dates,
Pistachoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the lovely Cypress-trees afford a pleasant shade against the excessive
heats. The best Wine of all <hi>Persia</hi> grows hereabouts, and in such abundance, that it is
transported all over the Kingdom, especially to the Court, where the King and great Lords
drink not any other. 'Tis more sprightly, and more pleasant then Canary; but in regard

desired God to make him immortal there: I left it the fifth of <hi>February,</hi> and passed by
two <hi>Caravanseras,</hi> and took up my lodging at the third, having travell'd that day ten
Leagues, through a fair even way.</p>
                  <p>The sixth, I got seven Leagues, having a very bad way, but in sight of many Villages,
whereof the prospect was the more pleasant, by reason of the Date-trees all about
them.</p>
                  <p>The seventh I passed by one of these <hi>Caravanseras,</hi> and got that day ten Leagues, taking
up my quarters in the little City of <hi>Scharim,</hi> in the middle of a Forrest of Date-trees. The
five dayes following were the most troublesome of all my life. For the eighth of <hi>February,</hi>
we got but five Leagues, through the most horrid way in the world. I cannot imagine
how people made a shift to travel that way, before <hi>Imanculi Chan</hi> (of whom somewhat
hath been said elsewhere, who was so cruelly put to death with all his children, by <hi>Schach
Sefi</hi>) caus'd it to be repaired, with incredible expence, when at this day a man cannot pass,
but in great danger of his life, by reason of the uneven and narrow wayes, between steepy
mountains on the one side, and dreadful precipices on the other; where I very narrowly
avoided a mis-fortune, which happens there very often. For my Horse's hoof, which I
was leading by the bridle, being fill'd with snow, he stumbled upon me, forc'd me out of
the way, so as that had I not caught hold of a wild Almond tree, which happened to be
there, as it were by miracle, I had there ended both my travel and life, in the precipices.
I lodg'd at night in a <hi>Caravansera,</hi> where I had a house over my head; but that was all,
for there was neither provender for my horses, nor any thing for my self and my servants
to eat.</p>
                  <p>The ninth, having travell'd three Leagues, I came to a <hi>Caravansera,</hi> where I found horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat.
After dinner, I got five Leagues farther, to another <hi>Caravansera;</hi> but meeting there
with the <hi>Armenian</hi> Caravan, and the <hi>Carmelite</hi> Father, whom I spoke of before, I rode on,
and travell'd two Leagues farther to a Village called <hi>Berry,</hi>

brought me to such gripings in the belly, which were accompanied by an oppression of the

to be made for a Litter, but there being none to be found, I was forc'd to get on the Horse

came to give me a visit, and having had an account of my quality and design, as also of
the nature of my indisposition, which was come to a bloudy Flux, with a burning Feaver,
they took me so much into their care, that within four dayes the Feaver left me, and I
made a shift to visit the <hi>Sulthan</hi> or Governour of the City.</p>
                  <p>I had before sent him the Letters of recommendation which <hi>Schach Sefi</hi> had given me,<note place="margin">Dines with the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi>

directed to him, so that he no sooner heard of my recovery, but he sent to invite me to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
whither I went the 28. As soon as I was come into the room, he made me sit down
by him, and to further my diversion and entertainment, he had intreated the <hi>Dutch</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
to bear me company, by which means I had the opportunity to be acquainted with
them. I shall say nothing of the particularities of this Entertainment, because there was
nothing in it extraordinary, or more then we had seen at <hi>Ispahan</hi> and elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>The same day came to <hi>Gamron</hi> a Vessel from <hi>Suratta,</hi> of 600.<note place="margin">MARCH.</note> Tun burthen. It belong'd
to the Governour of <hi>Suratta,</hi> who had employ'd an <hi>English</hi> Carpenter in the building of
it. There came in it a certain Queen, who was a Widow, Mother to the King of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with her Daughter. The King fell in love with the Daughter, and would have married
her, but the Mother would by no means consent to that incest, upon which he had forc'd
her out of the Kingdom. The Daughter came along with her Mother, preferring the
miseries of exile before the enjoyments of that incestuous marriage. It was reported, the
Mothers design was to marry her Daughter to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> or one of the chiefest
Lords of the Kingdom.</p>

one moyety of the Customs of <hi>Gamron,</hi> whereof we shall speak more anon.</p>
                  <p>The same day died my Surgeon of a burning Fever, on the seventh day of his sickness.
I must confess the loss of him was a very great affliction to me. For besides the great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
he had done me, and those he might still do me in my sickness, which I had not quite
shaken off; I might have expected many other good offices from him, upon the account of
his being well skill'd in the Languages he had gotten by travelling into <hi>Spain, Italy, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the <hi>East Indies,</hi> where he had been twice. To alleviate this affliction, I went one
day abroad a walking with one of the <hi>English</hi> Merchants, along the River side, where I saw
one of those Trees which <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> makes mention of in the ninth Book of his History,
in these terms, Alexander <hi>having crossed the River with</hi> Porus, <hi>went a good way into the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<hi>where he saw Forrests of a very vast extent full of trees, which were very thick with
boughs, and of an extraordinary height. Most of the Branches being as big as the boal of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Trees bow'd down to the ground, and having taken earth, grew up straight again, so that
a man would think they were not branches that started up, but other trees growing upon their
own roots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed so it was, that the branches which came out of the boal of the tree, getting
to the earth did there take root, and made another new tree, which at the height of fifteen
or twenty foot cast forth other branches, and so became a Forrest, rather then a Tree, since
that which I saw there was two hundred and fourteen paces about, and might well afford
shade to two thousand persons.<note place="margin">Arbol de Rays, <hi>or the</hi> Indian Fig-tree.</note> The <hi>Portuguez</hi> call it <hi>Arbol de Rays,</hi> and those who have

where we found the Saints Tomb all strew'd with Beans of several colours, and above
it, under a Canopy of Satin, several Lamps, which the Religious man is obliged to
keep in night and day. We shall have occasion to speak elsewhere of the Religion of the
<hi>Indians,</hi> and particularly of that of the <hi>Benjans;</hi> and therefore we shall here only say, that
it was not by chance that the Tomb was covered with Beans; but hence, that that Saint,
and the Guardian of his Sepulchre, were of the Sect which is called the <hi>Benjans,</hi> who
trade much to <hi>Gamron,</hi> and believe, with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that the souls of departed persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
into Beans: an opinion which is very common, not only among the Heathens of the

and to afford him their presence at that Ceremony, I got in among them, and follow'd him
about a quarter of a League out of the City, where the Envoy had caused a Tent to be
pitch'd in the Field. Being got thither, they made us all sit down, but the <hi>Sulthan</hi> stood,

put on the Robe, and the other Presents, and having made a short prayer for the
Kings prosperity, lifting up his eyes and hands to Heaven, and receiv'd the Complements
of the whole company, he mounted again, and return'd to the City where he was received
with the great Guns of both the Castles. At the entrance of his Palace he met the <hi>Molla,</hi>

For though the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> in their Catalogues put it at 25. degr. yet is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have made of it, and which we here follow, very just and
exact; it being certain, that most of the Maps that have been yet made, and particularly
that of <hi>Persia,</hi> are very defective.<note place="margin">The errour of certain Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</note> Their errour proceeds hence, that they put the <hi>Caspian</hi>
Sea too high, and consequently allow <hi>Persia</hi> a greater breadth from North to South, then it
really hath. For they put the City of <hi>Resht</hi> at 41. degrees, whereas it is at 37. and so the
breadth of all <hi>Persia</hi> can be but 10. degrees, taking it from <hi>Gamron</hi> to <hi>Rescht,</hi> or 12. at most,
if we should grant <hi>Ormus</hi> to be at 25. degrees: so that <hi>Boterus</hi> is extreamly mistaken, when
he allows <hi>Persia</hi> the extent of 18. degrees.</p>
                  <p>It is not long since that this place was but a little Village, consisting of some few Huts,
which the Fishermen had set up for their conveniencies, and it is since the reduction of

the entrance of the Haven, where there is a square Redoubt, with four pieces of Canon
upon it. The Fortifications of the Castle are antick, with round Bastions, but very well
furnished with great Guns. The Haven is so commodious, that Ships may anchor very
safely at five or six fathom water.<note place="margin">Its Houses.</note> The houses at <hi>Gamron</hi> built of a certain stone,
which they make of stiff Clay, Sand, shredded-Straw and Horse-dung mixt together,
whereof having set a Layer, they cover it with a Layer of Straw or Fagots, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Layer of Clay and Straw, and so alternately, till they have brought it six or seven
foot high: then they set fire to it, and so bake the Stone; and to fasten and cement them
together, they make a composition of the same Paste with Salt-water, and some Lime,
and by that means make a kind of Mortar, which is almost as hard as the Stone it self.</p>
                  <p>The best Houses are those of the <hi>Sulthan,</hi> or Governour of the City, and the Lodgings,
or Ware houses of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> which lie so near the Sea, that at High-water
the Tide comes up to the walls of them, which is a great convenience for the loading and
unloading of their Merchandizes. The lower rooms serve for Kitchins and Ware-houses,
and the upper for Lodgings, which are the more commodious in this respect, that being
high, they are the more fit to receive the wind of all sides, so in some measure to moderate
the excessive heat of the Sun. The meaner sort of people have no other covering over
them, then what they make with the branches and leaves of Date-trees, which they call

and which in the space of twenty four hours go through all the points of the Compass.
For in the morning they have an East-wind, which is extreamly cold; about noon a
South-wind, which brings insupportable heats along with it; in the evening a West-wind,
which coming fromwards <hi>Arabia,</hi> brings sufficient heats with it; and at midnight a
North-wind, which comes out of the Mountains of the Country, and is cold enough. It
rains so seldom, that it was observed in the year 1632. that with the rising of the Wind,
there falling a great shower,<note place="margin">A great drought.</note> after a continual drought of three years, the Inhabitants kept
a day of publick thanksgiving for it. Whence it comes that in the Country all about this
City, there is not so much as a Grass to be seen, unless it be in some Gardens, where they
are forc'd, twice or thrice every day, to water the Pot-herbs and Pulse which they sow in
them, and among the rest, particularly, Garlick, Onions, Chibols, Radishes and Cucumbers.

Peaches, Mangas, Quinces, Oranges, Lemons, and Pomegranates red and white. In
<hi>October</hi> they have Melons, Citruls, Cucumbers, Radishes, Onions, Turneps, Almonds, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stachoes,
Apples, Pears, and several other Fruits, which are very excellent, and in such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
that they are cheaper there then in any other place of <hi>Persia.</hi> The Inhabitants
live for the most part upon Fruits, and Pulse, and the Fish which they take in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Sea, and find more wholsom and delicious then Flesh, which meeting with but
little good sustenance, by reason of the extraordinary heats, must thereabouts be of ill nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
and in a manner without any taste. Among other sorts of Fish, they take there
abundance of Pilchards and Smelts, as also Oysters and Crabs. They have good store of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47786:199"/>
Cattle, as Oxen, Cows, Sheep, Goats, and several other Creatures; but they have such
abundance of Goats, that they are sold for six or eight pence a piece. There are also a
sort of Rams that have four horns, but no wild Fowl at all. Their ordinary drink is only
Water, unless it be that some have a little <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> made of Dates or Rice. <hi>Schiras</hi>
Wine, which is brought thither only in Bottles, is very scarce and very dear there; nay
the fair Water, which they get two Leagues from the City, is sold at such a rate, that what
I and my servants spent, cost me about two pence every day.</p>
                  <p>Persons of quality, and Merchants, are clad after the <hi>Persian</hi> mode, but all the rest go
naked, and cover only the privy parts. The Women wear about their arms and legs a
great many Rings, or Plates of Silver, Brass, or Iron, according to their conditions and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
They fasten to their hair a Bodkin, or a long flat piece of Silver gilt, or Brass, which
hangs down over the middle of their foreheads to the end of the nose, and they thrust
through the left nostril a Gold Ring, having in the middle a Turquese, a Granat, or haply a
little Gold Knob or Button enamell'd, or simple, and the Pendants they wear in their
ears are so heavy, that if those were not well fastned to their heads, they would go near to
force them thence.</p>
                  <p>The great heats begin to abate in <hi>October,</hi> and so from that time till the beginning of
<hi>May</hi> is the season of greatest trading. Then it is that all Nations come thither with their

There is made also in those parts great quantities of Linnen-cloath; but the Weavers,
instead of doing their work in Looms at their houses as they do elsewhere, fasten the woof
of the cloath to some Tree, without the City, and having made a pit in the ground, they
put their feet into it, so that when they come home at night, it is no great trouble for them

a person of great resolution, thought his only course, to settle himself there, was to set
upon the Kingdom of <hi>Ormus,</hi> which he did with 470. Souldiers, whom he had aboard his
Fleet. <hi>Emanuel Osorio,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Selvas</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> sayes, that <hi>Albuquerque</hi> made his

the principal Minister of State, whose name was <hi>Cojeatar,</hi> a Forreigner, a Native of
<hi>Bengala,</hi> and an Eunuch, had exasperated the people against him, by converting the publick
Revenue of the Kingdom to his own profit and advantage, having left his Soveraign only
the bare Title of King, he thought fit to strike in at that conjuncture of Affairs, and to
that end left <hi>Zocotora</hi> upon the 20. of <hi>August,</hi> and having in a very few dayes taken in the
Cities of <hi>Cala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the principal City, to which he came the 25. of <hi>September.</hi> The first thing he did, was
to defeat a very strong Fleet, which the <hi>Moors</hi> had within the Haven, and by that means
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47786:200"/>
oblig'd the King to come to a capitulation, by which the King of <hi>Ormus</hi> promised to take
the Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity to the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> to pay him every year fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
thousand Ducats as a Tribute, in Gold, Silver or Pearls, and five thousand towards the
charges of the present War; and to permit <hi>Albuquerque</hi> to build a Cittadel where he
should think most convenient for the preservation of the City.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portuguez</hi> began the said Cittadel on the 25. of <hi>October</hi> following, and gave it the
name of <hi>Our Blessed Lady of Victory.</hi> It is true, this establishment was not so absolute at
the beginning, but that the <hi>Moors</hi> made some attempts to rid themselves of these new
Guests: but the <hi>Portuguez</hi> made a shift to maintain what they had gotten, and to make
the place they were in a Magazine of Armes for the <hi>Indies;</hi> taking occasion by that means
to engross all the Commerce to themselves, and obliging all the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> to
buy of them all those Commodities which they stood in need of from the <hi>Indians.</hi> Nay,
this was so rigorously observed, that the Governour of <hi>Ormus</hi> prohibited the Inhabitants
to sell any of their Commodities, till such time as he had sold his own. The permitted
<hi>Seyfadin</hi> to live in the Island, but at a certain place far enough from the Cittadel, so not to
give the <hi>Portuguez</hi> any occasion of jealousie. <hi>Scach Abas,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> being no longer
able to endure the insolence of the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> and very much incens'd at their receiving
into Protection the Gentlemen of the House of the <hi>Gabrieli,</hi> whom we have spoken of
elsewhere, bethought himself of some course to get these Forreigners out of those parts.
To effect this, he address'd himself to the <hi>English,</hi> who traded at <hi>Ormus;</hi> and by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
proffers that he made, oblig'd them to promise him all the assistance they could
to carry on the siege of that City, which was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>aulted and taken by the <hi>English,</hi> in the year
1622. They put both the City and Cittadel into the hands of the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who
found in it six hundred great Guns, some Iron, some Brass, which <hi>Scach Abas</hi> caused to be
transported to <hi>Laar</hi> and <hi>Ispahan,</hi> all but fourscore Pieces, which he left in the Cittadel;
He caused the walls of the City to be demolish'd, and the Materials thereof to be transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Gamron,</hi> which began even at that time to raise it self upon the ruines of its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
The King of <hi>Persia,</hi> desirous to reward the services which the <hi>English</hi> had done
him upon that occasion, did not only grant them an absolute exemption from all Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but he also bestow'd on them one moyety of those Duties which other Merchants
were to pay there; but, as we said before, the <hi>English</hi> come very far short of receiving what
is due to them.</p>
                  <p>I found in the Port of <hi>Gamron</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Ship called the <hi>Swan,</hi> of 300. Tun, carrying
24. Guns. Master <hi>Honywood,</hi> Agent for the Affairs of <hi>England,</hi> recommended me to the
Captain of it, and commanded him to carry me over to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and to defray all my
charges till I came to <hi>Suratta.</hi> I had brought eight Horses with me, making account to
sell them with very great advantage in the <hi>Indies;</hi> but the Ship was so full of Goods, that
it was with much ado that I could get in only two of them: So that I was forc'd to
put off the other six, to very great loss, as being able to get but thirty pound for those
which had cost me sixty pound at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and which I should have sold at above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty pound at <hi>Suratta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I embark'd the sixth of <hi>April,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">APRIL.</note> with Mr. <hi>Manley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hall, English</hi> Merchants, whom

that were at <hi>Gamron,</hi> as also many <hi>Indian</hi> Merchants, with whom I had upon some
occasions made acquaintance. The Captain ordered four Pieces to be fired at our coming
aboard, and received us with much civility, inviting us, it being then about noon, to dine
with him.</p>
                  <p>We went from <hi>Gamron</hi> to <hi>Suratta</hi> in nineteen dayes, during which the Captain treated
me very magnificently, and did me the honour to resign his own bed to me, and to give me
precedence upon all occasions. He was well furnished with Fowl, Mutton, and other fresh
Meat, but above all things, with excellent good Sack, <hi>English</hi> Beer, <hi>French</hi> Wines, <hi>Arak,</hi>
and other refreshments; which prov'd so well for me, that by the help of these good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials,
and the benefit I had by the drinking of <hi>Ptizanne,</hi> which I caused to be made with
Cinnamon and rinds of Pomegranats, at my arrival at <hi>Suratta,</hi> I found my health
perfectly recover'd, though I must also acknowledge, as much contributing thereto, my
using of <hi>Thé,</hi> to which I had so accustomed my self, that I ordinarily took it twice or
thrice a day.</p>
                  <p>The contrary wind prevented our departure the day that we came aboard, so that we lay
at Anchor all the night following; and the next day, being the seventh, we set sail, taking
our course towards the Isle of <hi>Ormus:</hi> but towards night there rose so great a tempest, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a West-wind, that to avoid running upon the shore, we were forced to cast An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
in sight of the Isle.</p>

                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47786:200"/>
Sunday, being the eighth, we laveer'd it with a West-wind, endeavouring to pass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Isles of <hi>Ormus</hi> and <hi>Kismich,</hi> which are four Leagues distant one from the other.
About two in the afternoon, we cast over-board the body of a young Sea-man, who died
of the Bloudy-flux two dayes before. This Ceremony, which I had not seen before, put
me into so much the greater fright, in that being still troubled with the same disease, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
they would shortly do as much by me.</p>
                  <p>The night following we pass'd in sight of the two Islands we spoke of last, to wit, <hi>Ormus</hi>
and <hi>Kismich;</hi> and the next day, being the ninth, we discovered the Continent of <hi>Arabia,</hi>
taking our course along the Coast, which is thereabouts, without any danger.</p>
                  <p>Tuesday 10. A calm staid us at the same place, and the 11. we put off from the Coasts
of <hi>Arabia,</hi> to make towards those of <hi>Persia,</hi> which we still kept in sight of till Thursday
night, <hi>April</hi> 12. Then a good West-north-west wind rising, we took our course towards
the East-south-east, at 25. degrees, 50. minutes elevation.</p>
                  <p>Friday morning, we could perceive no Land, but had sight of a Pirate, who by his making
ever and anon more or less sail, discover'd he had somewhat to say to us. One while he
came somewhat near us; another, he kept at a great distance; but at last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perceiving we
made it our business to get the wind of him, he made towards the Isle of <hi>Zocotora.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Island is seated at 21. degrees 40. minutes,<note place="margin">The scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Island of <hi>Zocoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi>
                     </note> at the entrance of the Red-sea, having
towards the South-west, and North-east, the Country of <hi>Melinda</hi> or <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and towards
the South <hi>Arabia,</hi> from which it is distant about sixteen Leagues. It is about 25. Leagues
in length, but not above ten in breadth, having on all sides very good riding for Ships, and
safe Harbours. It is indifferently well peopled, and is subject to the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whom it is governed by a <hi>Sulthan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants are of low stature,<note place="margin">Its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</note> and rather lean then fat, of a duskish complexion,
and very laborious. Their only sustenance is Fish and Fruits, living very temperately.
They treat their Wives, whom they buy in <hi>Arabia,</hi> with much civility, and have a certain
respect for them; but will not permit Strangers to see them. They are very crafty in their
trading, and delight much in it, though they have but few things to sell. And whereas
they adulterate almost all their Commodities, they are accordingly distrustful of those
which are brought to them.</p>
                  <p>They reduce Dates into a paste, and it serves them instead of Bread. The Island affords
very few Oranges, and those not very good, Tobacco, and Citruls. There are also some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos-trees,
but not many, the fruit not coming to ripeness there, by reason the ground is very
full of stones.</p>
                  <p>Their main wealth consists in Aloes,<note place="margin">The Aloes of <hi>Zocotora.</hi>
                     </note> the juyce whereof they gather in bladders, or Goats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins;
and dry it in the Sun. They have also the gummy juyce called Dragons-bloud, and
Civet, which may be bought there at about three or four Crowns an Ounce: but those
who are not very well skill'd in that Drug are many times cheated; for the Inhabitants of
the Island put Grease and other nasty stuff into it. They keep abundance of Civet-cats
about their houses, but they have very little tame Fowl; wild none at all. They have
Camels, Asses, Oxen, Cows, Sheep and Goats, whose hair about the thighs is curl'd much
after the manner that Satyrs are painted. The Town where the <hi>Sulthan</hi> hath his residence
is called <hi>Tamary,</hi> and hath in it a Fort, which is distant from the Sea about a Canon-shot,
with four Guns.</p>
                  <p>Their Arms are a kind of broad Swords,<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

guard. In their Girdles they wear also Poniards, the blades whereof are above three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
broad towards the handle, but very sharp towards the point. They are so curious, as
to have something of Silver or Copper about the handles, but their Fire-arms are not well
kept, and yet they are very expert at the handling of them, as they are also in mannaging
those little Bucklers, wherewith they defend themselves in fight.</p>
                  <p>Ships may take in fresh water there without any trouble, for the waters which come
from the Mountains fall into the Sea like a River. They have no other Boats then such
as are absolutely flat-bottom'd, which they make use of in their fishing, which is very
good thereabouts. They have this common with the <hi>Arabians</hi> and other <hi>Mahumetans,</hi>
that they eat no Swines flesh; but even in <hi>Tamary</hi> it self there is no <hi>Mosquey,</hi> nor any
other place for them to meet at to do their Devotions. These they do morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
at the rising and setting of the Sun, to which they make very low reverences, and
mutter certain words between their teeth; this they do also three or four times a day
besides.</p>

                  <p>Within a League of the Road we entred into the River upon which <hi>Surat</hi> is seated,
and which hath on both sides a very fertile soil, and many fair Gardens, with pleasant
Country-houses, which being all white, a colour it seems the <hi>Indians</hi> are much in love
with, afford a noble prospect amidst the greeness whereby they are encompassed. But
this River, which is the <hi>Tapte,</hi> called by others <hi>Tynde,</hi> is so shallow at the mouth of it,
that Barks of 70. or 80. Tun can hardly come into it. We came ashore near the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>'s
Palace, and went immediately to the Custom-house to have our things search'd by
the Officers there: which is done with such exactness in this place, that they think it not
enough to open Chests and Portmantles, but examine peoples clothes and pockets. The
<hi>Sulthan</hi> or Governour, nay the Customers themselves, oblige Merchants and Passengers
to part with, at the price they shall think fit to put upon them, those Goods and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
which they had brought for their own private use. Accordingly the <hi>Sulthan</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who came to the Custom-house as soon as we were got thither, having found among
my things a bracelet of yellow Amber, and a Diamond, would needs buy them both of
me: whereto when I made him answer, that I was no Merchant, and that I valued
those things, only for their sakes who had bestow'd them on me, he was pleas'd to return
me the Diamond, but detain'd the Bracelet, telling me I should have it again when I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
him with a Visit.</p>
                  <p>While we were in this contestation, came to the place an <hi>Indian</hi> Coach, drawn by two
white Oxen, which the <hi>English</hi> President had sent to bring me to their House; so that
leaving the <hi>Sulthan</hi> with the Bracelet, I went into it. At the entrance of the House I
met the President, with his second, that is to say, he who commands under him, and in
his absence, whose name was Mr. <hi>Fremling,</hi> who received me with extraordinary kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and very civilly answer'd the Complement I made them, upon the freedom I took to
make my advantage thereof. The President, who spoke <hi>Dutch</hi> very well, told me I was
very welcome; that in the Country where we then were, all Christians were oblig'd to
assist one another, and that he was the more particularly oblig'd thereto as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
me, in respect of the affection I would have express'd towards some of his Nation
at <hi>Ispahan.</hi> He thereupon brought me to his Chamber, where there was a Collation rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
It consisted of Fruits and Preserves, according to the custom of the Country. As
soon as we were set, he asked me what my design was, and understanding that I intended
to return for <hi>Germany</hi> within twelve moneths, he told me I was come too late to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
that year, by reason no more Ships would come that way, but that if I would stay
with him five or six moneths, till there were a convenience of passage, he would take it
kindly: that during that time, he would contribute all he could to my divertisement:
<pb facs="tcp:47786:201"/>

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47786:203"/>
that he would find out a means how I might see the most eminent places in the Country,
nay, that he would send some of his own Nation along with me, who should find me those
accommodations I could not otherwise hope for. This obliging discourse soon prevail'd
with me to accept of these proffers, so that the he shew'd me all the house, that I might make
choice of a convenient Lodging, which I took near his Seconds Chamber. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
some Merchants and others, belonging to the President, came and brought me from
my Chamber to supper into a great Hall, where was the Minister with about a dozen Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nts,
who kept me company, but the President and his Second supp'd not, as being
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> stom'd to that manner of life, out of a fear of overcharging their Stomachs, digestion
being slowly performed, by reason of the great heats which are as troublesome there in
the night time as in the day. After Supper the Minister carried me into a great open Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
where I found the President and his Second taking the coolness of the Sea-Air. This
was the place of our ordinary rendezvous, where we met every night; to wit, the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
his Second, the principal Merchant, the Minister and my self; but the other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
came not but when they were invited by the President. At dinner he kept a great
Table, of about fifteen or sixteen dishes of Meat, besides the Desert.</p>
                  <p>The respect and deference which the other Merchants have for the President was very
remarkable,<note place="margin">The respect the <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Surat</hi> have for their Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> as also the order which was there observed in all things, especially at Divine
Service, which was said twice a day, in the morning at six, and at eight at night, and on
Sundayes thrice. No person in the house but had his particular Function, and their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
hours assign'd them as well for work as recreation. Our divertisement was thus order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">Their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note>
On Fridayes after Prayers, there was a particular Assembly, at which met with us
three other Merchants, who were of kin to the President, and had left as well as he their
Wives in <hi>England,</hi> which day being that of their departure from <hi>England,</hi> they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
it for to make a commemoration thereof, and drink their Wives healths. Some
made their advantage of this meeting to get more then they could well carry away, though
every man was at liberty to drink what he pleas'd, and to mix the Sack as he thought fit,
or to drink <hi>Palepuntz,</hi> which is a kind of drink consisting of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> Rose-water, juice
of Citrons and Sugar.</p>
                  <p>At our ordinary meetings every day, we took only <hi>Thé,</hi> which is commonly used all
over the <hi>Indies,</hi> not only among those of the Country, but also among the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>English,</hi> who take it as a Drug that cleaness the Stomach, and digests the superfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
by a temperate heat particular thereto. The <hi>Persians</hi> instead of <hi>Thé;</hi> drink their
<hi>Kahwa,</hi> which cools and abates the natural heat which <hi>Thé</hi> preserves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>English</hi> have a fair Garden without the City, whither we constantly went on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
after Sermon, and sometimes also on other dayes of the week, where our Exercise
was shooting at Butts, at which I made a shift to get a hundred <hi>Mamoudis</hi> (or five
pound sterling) every week. After these divertisements, we had a Collation of Fruit
and Preserves, and bath'd our selves in a Tanke or Cistern which had five foot water,
where some <hi>Dutch</hi> Gentlewomen serv'd and entertain'd us with much civility. What
troubled me most was, that my little acquaintance with the <hi>English</hi> Tongue made me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of Conversation, unless it were with the President, who spoke <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I relate what happened to me in this Voyage, and what I saw during my stay
at <hi>Surat,</hi> it will not be amiss, to give here a general, but short description, of the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s
Country, and the Provinces whereof it consists; so to make the readier way for what we
shall have to say of it hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The Country properly called <hi>India,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A general description of <hi>indost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han.</hi>
                     </note> which the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> name <hi>Indosthan,</hi>
reaches, on the West-side, from the River <hi>Indus</hi> or <hi>Sindo,</hi> and the Kingdom of the same
name (the Inhabitants whereof are called <hi>Abint,</hi> or from the Frontiers of the Kingdom
of <hi>Maecon,</hi> which some call <hi>Gelsche Macquerona,</hi> whereof the Inhabitants are <hi>Baloches,</hi>
or <hi>Baluches)</hi> as far as <hi>Ganges.</hi> The Ancients called this Province <hi>Carmania,</hi> and it hath
a Port or Haven called <hi>Guader,</hi> at 25. degrees on this side the line. The <hi>Persians</hi> and
<hi>Arabians</hi> call the Kingdom of <hi>Sindo Diul.</hi> The same <hi>Persians,</hi> and the <hi>Indosthans</hi> call the
River <hi>Indus, Pangab,</hi> that is to say, five waters, because so many Rivers come into it before
it falls into the Sea under that famous name. The first is that of <hi>Bugal,</hi> or <hi>Begal,</hi> which
rises near <hi>Kabul.</hi> The second is called <hi>Chanab,</hi> and rises in the Province of <hi>Quesmir</hi> or
<hi>Cassimier,</hi> fifteen dayes journey above <hi>Lahor,</hi> towards the North. The third is that of
<hi>Ravy,</hi> or <hi>Ravee,</hi> which runs by <hi>Lahor,</hi> and rises not far from it. The two others, <hi>viz.
Via</hi> and <hi>Osuid</hi> or <hi>Sind,</hi> come from a great distance, and meet near <hi>Bakar,</hi> which lies at an
equal distance between <hi>Lahor</hi> and the Sea. Whence it is to be inferr'd, that those Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers
are in an errour, who put this River at 24. degrees on this side the Line, and
confound it with that which runs by <hi>Diul.</hi> Some say the great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Kingdom is of so
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47786:204"/>
vast an extent, that a <hi>Caravan</hi> would have much ado to travel through it in two years; but
these are Fables. Its certain Frontiers, according to the description of <hi>Edward Terrin,</hi>
are on the East-side, the Kingdom of <hi>Mavy;</hi> on the West, part of <hi>Persia</hi> and the South-Sea;
on the North, Mount <hi>Caucasus</hi> and great <hi>Tartaria;</hi> and on the South, the Kingdom
of <hi>Decan</hi> and the Gulf of <hi>Bengala,</hi> containing thirty and seven great Provinces, which
were heretofore so many Kingdoms: to wit,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Candahar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Its Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> which takes its name from, or derives it to the chief City, is the most Western
Province of all the <hi>Indies,</hi> and lies upon the Territories of the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who hath
several times been Master of it.<note place="margin">1. Canda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har.</note> It is indeed for this Province, that the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi>
are in continual war almost with the great <hi>Mogul;</hi> as they are in <hi>Turkey</hi> side for <hi>Badgat</hi>
and <hi>Ervan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Province of <hi>Kabul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Kabul.</note> which is no doubt the richest of all the Kingdom, derives its
name also from the Capital City, and hath for Frontier on the North-side great <hi>Tartary.</hi>
In this Province rises the River <hi>Nibal,</hi> which changes its name into that of <hi>Begal,</hi> and falls
into the <hi>Indus,</hi> as we said before. It is conceived by some, that this is the <hi>Coa,</hi> or the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astus</hi>
of <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Province of <hi>Multan</hi> owes its name also to the principal City,<note place="margin">3. Multan.</note> and is seated along
the River <hi>Indus,</hi> having on the West-side the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the Province of
<hi>Candahar.</hi>
                  </p>

but it hath no considerable City.</p>
                  <p>

Kingdom. It hath on the South-south-west-side, the Province of <hi>Tatta,</hi> and towards the
West, the people called the <hi>Bolaches,</hi> a cruel and warlike Nation.</p>
                  <p>The Province of <hi>Tatta,</hi> which hath also its name from the chief City, is divided into
several Isles by the River <hi>Indus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">6. Tatta.</note> This Province hath the reputation of having the most

                  <p>The Province of <hi>Iselmere</hi> hath but one City in it of the same name,<note place="margin">8. Iselmere.</note> and hath for Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers

                  <p>The Province of <hi>Pang-ab</hi> is one of the greatest,<note place="margin">10. Peng-ab.</note> most fertile, and most considerable of all
the Kingdom. The five Rivers we spoke of, which pass through it, give it that name.
<hi>Lahor</hi> is the chief City thereof.</p>

and after a great compass falls into the <hi>Ganges.</hi> It touches some part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Kabul,</hi> and is cold enough by reason of its Mountains, though it may be affirm'd,
that in comparison of the Kingdom of <hi>Tliebet,</hi> which is as it were its Frontiers on the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
it is very temperate. About eight <hi>Cos</hi> (which make four Leagues) from the chief
City, in the midst of a Lake which is three miles about, there is a little Isle, where the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul</hi>
hath built a very fair House, for the convenience of hunting the wild Goose. All along
the River which runs through the middle of this Lake, there is a kind of tree, whose
leaves are like that of a Chesnut, but the wood, which is somewhat of a brownish colour,
is checquer'd with small streaks of several colours, which makes it much sought after by
persons of Quality.</p>
                  <p>The Province of <hi>Chismer</hi> hath on the East-side that of <hi>Bankisch,</hi>

my stay at <hi>Surat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While I was at <hi>Ispahan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</note> having fixt my resolution to travel into the <hi>Indies,</hi> I took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my service a <hi>Persian,</hi> who was to serve me as an Interpreter for the <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Languages, which I then began a little to understand. He was born of Christian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47786:205"/>
his father and mother having been of those whom <hi>Scach-Abas</hi> had caused to be
translated from <hi>Georgia</hi> to <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where his brethren then lived in good rank. Which
considerations oblig'd me to treat him with the greater civility, and to promise him by
way of wages four Crowns a moneth. He had made me believe that his engaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into my service was partly out of this respect, that he might thereby have the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of re-imbracing the <hi>Christian Religion:</hi> but he had no sooner made his first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances
at <hi>Surat,</hi> ere he understood, that an Uncle of his by the Mother-side could
raise him to great fortunes at the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Court, where he was Master of the Horse. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this intelligence, he soon took a resolution to leave me, and to desire the protection of
the <hi>Sulthan,</hi> who kept him a while at his own house, and afterwards sent him to <hi>Agra.</hi> I
was the more startled at this departure of the young fellow, the more it run in my
thoughts, that knowing all the particulars of our engagement with the <hi>Indian</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> his design might be to betray me into the hands of my enemies. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
had I known of his going to <hi>Agra,</hi> I should not have had the confidence to take
that place in my way: though it might appear, by what happened afterwards, that God
sent him to that place expresly to save my life, since, had it not been for him, I might have
lost it there.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>May,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">MAY.</note> there came news to <hi>Surat,</hi> that the <hi>Chan,</hi> who commanded at <hi>Candahar</hi> for the

that the <hi>Scach</hi> had threatned to put him to death. The <hi>Mogul</hi> sent immediately 500000.
Crowns to the place, as a requital for the Governours service, and to pay the Garrison,
which had revolted along with him. <hi>Alymerdan-Chan,</hi> Governour of the same place,
had done such another trick at the beginning of <hi>Schach-Sefi</hi>

oblige him to bring his head to Court, which if he had done, he had never carried it away
again upon his shoulders. Soon after <hi>Scach</hi> recover'd <hi>Candahar</hi> again; and it was partly
upon this account, that the <hi>Mogul</hi> had sent to him the Embassadour I spoke of before,
though among his other Instructions, he had order to demand the <hi>Myrsa Polagi,</hi> his
Nephew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iune</hi> 16.<note place="margin">JVNE.</note> I went out a hunting with a young <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant, and another <hi>English</hi>
Merchant, with whom having cross'd the River, they brought me to an old ruin'd City,
called <hi>Reniel,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> have a Ware-house. The Inhabitants of this City are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Naites,</hi> and are for the most part either Mariners or Trades-men, and of the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
Religion. The streets of it are narrow, and the houses so rais'd from the foundation,
that there is not any but hath one step to get up to it. There we staid all night, and were
nobly treated by the Merchants, who had the management of the Trade there.</p>
                  <p>The next day we went to a Village called <hi>Bodick,</hi> and in our way let fly at a wild Duck
and a Heron; there we saw about twenty Deers. Their skins which were somewhat
greyish, were checkquer'd all over with white spots, and they had fair Horns, with several
Brow-ancklers. There was among them a sort of creatures about the bigness of our Ro-Bucks,
the Skins whereof were inclining to a dark brown, checkquer'd also with white
spots, having very graceful Horns. Some are of opinion, that these are the same that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus</hi>
calls <hi>Cervi-capras,</hi> and that it is from this kind of Beast that we have <hi>Bezoar.</hi>
We went thence to another Village, called <hi>Damre,</hi> where we saw abundance of wild Ducks
in the Rice, whereof there grows great store in those parts. All the fields have a little
ascent raised about them to keep in the water, the Rice requiring much moisture. In this
Village we found some <hi>Terry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Terry,</hi> of Palm-Wine.</note> which is a Liquor drawn out of the Palm-trees, and drunk of
it in Cups made of the leaves of the same Tree. To get out the Juyce, they go up to the top of
the Tree, where they make an incision in the bark, and fasten under it an earthen pot, which
they leave there all night, in which time it is fill'd with a certain sweet Liquor very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to the taste. They get out some also in the day time, but that corrupts immediately,
and is good only for Vinegar, which is all the use they make of it.</p>

of the Customs at the Exportation and Importation of all Merchandises, which pay three
and a half in the hundred, except it be Gold and Silver, whether coined, or in wedges, or
made into bars, which pay but two in the hundred.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> have their Houses there which they call <hi>Lodges,</hi> and are spacious

which are brought thence to <hi>Suratta</hi> by Land. This Road lies at 21. degrees,
50. minutes, upon the course of North-east and South-west. The entrance into it is not
very broad, since that at high-water there is but seven fathom water, and at low but five.
The Haven it self is not above 500. paces broad before the Village, sandy at the bottom,
and most of the banks are bare and dry at low-water, and so sharp and steepy, that sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is to no purpose at all. 'Tis very safe riding, there being no danger of any wind
but that of the South-west. But from <hi>May</hi> to <hi>September</hi> there is no staying on those
Coasts, by reason of the winds and tempests, accompany'd by extraordinary thunder and
lightning, which reign there during all that time.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Surat</hi> are either <hi>Benjans, Bramans,</hi> or <hi>Moguls.</hi> These last are <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans,</hi>

and much better look'd on then the others, as well upon the account of their
Religion, which they have common with the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and the chiefest Lords of the
Country, as upon that of the profession they make to bear Arms. They have an aversion
for Trades and Merchandise, and had rather serve, then engage themselves in any honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
employment: for if they can but once get to be Masters of a Horse, they court Fortune
no further, and immediately list themselves in the service of their Prince. The <hi>Benjans</hi>
on the contrary, are a reserv'd people and laborious, and apply themselves to Trades and
Merchandise, and have an extraordinary devotion for the things that concern Religion; as
we shall have occasion to insist on more at large hereafter.</p>
                  <p>There are also in the City some <hi>Arabians, Persians, Armenians, Turks</hi> and <hi>Iews,</hi> who

                     </note>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> the 14. of that moneth, news was brought that two <hi>English</hi> Ships were arrived at the
Port of <hi>Subaly.</hi> The President would have gone thither in person, but some business he
had with the Governour hindred him; so that he was forc'd to send two of the chiefest
Merchants, who took me along with them. We came to <hi>Suhaly</hi> about noon, and having
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47786:206"/>
left our Horses in the Village, went aboard one of the Ships, called the <hi>Discovery.</hi> 'Twas a
Vessel of 600. Tun, having 28. Guns, and 190. Men. Captain <hi>Menard,</hi> who commanded
her, and the three Merchants who came to the President for Orders, receiv'd us kindly;
and being come directly from <hi>England,</hi> they told us all they knew of the Affairs of <hi>Europe;</hi>
which discourse made us pass away the best part of the night pleasantly enough. The next
day we went to the other Vessel, called the <hi>Mary,</hi> which was 1200. Tun burthen, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
48. Guns. She had past by <hi>Aden</hi> on the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> where she had lost her Captain, who
dy'd of sickness. The Merchant, who commanded her instead of the Captain, made us a
reception equal to what we had in the other Ship; and both of them oblig'd us to come
every day to see them, till the President were come, which was not till eight dayes after.
Which hindred not but that we went sometimes a walking, and a hunting, but so as that
we lay every night in one of the Ships.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the Commanders heard that the President was come to <hi>Suhaly,</hi> they went a
shore, and meeting him on the River side, he made a short discourse to them, exhorting
them to shew their fidelity and complyance to their Superiours, during the time they should
stay in the <hi>Indies.</hi> Which done, he went into the Boat, to go aboard of the first Ship,
where they fir'd twelve Guns at his arrival. After supper, he went along with the whole
company, to the other, where they fir'd sixteen Guns, besides those that were discharg'd at
the drinking of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s health, and those of some other persons of Honour
in that Country. The two dayes following were spent in feasting, at which the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the two Ships treated the President, who afterwards return'd to <hi>Suratta;</hi> but
night overtaking us by the way, we were forc'd to take up our Lodging in the little City
of <hi>Reniel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 24. of the same moneth arrived two other Ships,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Boldue</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of 1400 Tun.</note> whereof one was called <hi>Boldue,</hi> a
<hi>Hollander,</hi> of 1400. Tun. She came from the City of <hi>Batavia</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Iava,</hi> and
was returning for <hi>Holland,</hi> loaden with Pepper and other Spices: The other was an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Vessel, call'd the <hi>Swan,</hi> and had been sent by the Secretary of <hi>Mesulipatan</hi> into <hi>Persia</hi>
for Silks; but the contrary winds having kept her four moneths together at Sea, had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
her to put in at <hi>Suratta,</hi> whereas the <hi>Hollander</hi> had in less time made the whole Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
from the <hi>Texel</hi> to the <hi>Indies.</hi> I again accompany'd the Merchants, who went to the
Port to see their Ships. We went first aboard the <hi>Hollander,</hi> who receiv'd us very nobly,
and we were shewn all the conveniences of the Vessel, which no doubt was the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
and the biggest that ever came out of the Ports of <hi>Holland.</hi> It was twenty foot
longer then the <hi>Mary,</hi> but not altogether so broad.</p>
                  <p>During my abode at <hi>Suratta,</hi> I wanted for no divertisement; for either I walk'd down
to the Haven, or found company in the City, especially at the <hi>Dutch</hi> Presidents, who had
his Family there, and with whom it was the easier for me to make acquaintance, in as much
as I could converse with them in my own Language. But understanding that the <hi>English</hi>
Ships, with which I intended to return into <hi>Europe,</hi> would not be ready for their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
under three or four moneths, I resolv'd to take a journey into the Country, to the
Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Court, taking my advantage of a <hi>Caffila,</hi> or <hi>Caravan,</hi> of thirty Wagons
loaden with Quick-silver, <hi>Roen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi> which is a root that dies red, Spices, and a considerable
sum of Money, which the <hi>English</hi> were sending to <hi>Amadabat.</hi> The President had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
four Merchants, certain <hi>Benjans,</hi> twelve <hi>English</hi> Souldiers, and as many <hi>Indians,</hi> to
conduct and convoy this small <hi>Caravan;</hi> so that confident I night undertake this journey
without any danger, (which it had not been safe for me to attempt without this conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
by reason of the <hi>Rasboutes,</hi> and their robberies upon the high-way;) I took the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
advice, and put my self into their company.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Rasboutes</hi> are a sort of High-way men,<note place="margin">Rasbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> or Tories, who keep in the Mountains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Brodra</hi> and <hi>Broitscheia,</hi> which are called <hi>Champenir,</hi> where they have their fortifi'd
places and retreats, wherein they sometimes make their party good against the <hi>Mogul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Not long before, he had taken in one of their strongest places, and by that means kept
them a long time in subjection; but they revolted again, and exercised their robberies with
greater cruelty then ever.</p>
                  <p>We left <hi>Suratta</hi> the last of <hi>September,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Leaves <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratta</hi> to go to <hi>Amada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</hi>
                     </note> being accompany'd by the President and some
<hi>English</hi> Merchants, who having brought us a League out of the City, there took leave of
us. We took our way towards <hi>Broitschia,</hi> and came to the Village of <hi>Briou,</hi> or <hi>Briauw,</hi>
where we cross'd the River. Then, at four Leagues distance from <hi>Briou,</hi> we pass'd by
<hi>Cattodera,</hi> which is a ruin'd place, seated upon a River of the same name, and then by
<hi>Enklisser,</hi> where we soon made a shift to take above thirty wild Ducks, and many other
Water-fowl, wherewith we feasted our people. We also kill'd a Roebuck, and met with
so many Deer and wild Boars, that it was no hard matter for us to get us a good supper,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47786:207"/>
since the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> never travel without their Cooks, who dress the Fowl and
what else their Masters kill, which they never fail to do in abundance. The next day we
cross'd a River which is more broad then deep,<note place="margin">Comes to <hi>Broitschia.</hi>
                     </note> before we came to the City of <hi>Broitschia,</hi>
into which we were no sooner entred, but the <hi>English</hi> Secretary sent to us to dine with
him, which we did.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Broitschia</hi> is at 21. degrees, 56. minutes, 12. Leagues from <hi>Suratta,</hi>

                     </note> and 8.
from the Sea, upon a River falling out of the Mountains, which divide the Kingdom of
<hi>Decar</hi> from that of <hi>Balagatta.</hi> It lies upon a pretty high Mountain, having its Walls of
Free-stone, and so well built, that it may be numbred among the strongest places of all the
<hi>Indies.</hi> On the Land side, it hath two great Gates, and two small Gates towards the
River, by which is brought abundance of Timber for building, which none dare unload
without the Governours express permission. There is a Guard kept in it, as well upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the place it self, which is very considerable, as upon this, that they exact there two
in the hundred upon all Merchandises that pass through it. The City is sufficiently well
peopled, as also its Suburbs, which are divided into two quarters, which they call <hi>Poera,</hi>
though very few persons of Quality live therein, most of the Inhabitants being only Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
who make of those kinds of Cottons called <hi>Bastas,</hi> which are finer then any made in
the Province of <hi>Gusaratta.</hi> All the fields about this City lie flat and even, unless it be
that about five or six Leagues from it, towards the South-west, may be seen the Mountains
called <hi>Pindatshce,</hi> which reach as far as <hi>Barampour</hi> and beyond it, and are very fertile, as
is also all the rest of the Country, which brings forth Rice, Wheat, Barly, and Cotton in
abundance. It is out of these Mountains that the <hi>Agat</hi> is gotten, whereof are made such
noble drinking Cups, Seals, Handles of Knives and Daggers, and several other rarities,
which are commonly to be bought at <hi>Cambays.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The jurisdiction of the City of <hi>Broitschia</hi> extends it self over 84. Villages, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesne
whereof belongs to it, but heretofore its territory comprehended three other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
who have now their particular Governours. Four Leagues below the City, the River
divides it self into two branches, which there make an Isle near half a League about, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
which it falls into the Sea, by two several channels. It hath no Port, but only a Road,
which is so much the more dangerous, in that the Ships, which may indeed anchor there at
seven fathom water, lie open to the mercy of all Winds.</p>
                  <p>Eight Leagues from <hi>Broitschia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Indico.</note> upon the way of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> there is a great Village called
<hi>Ianbaysar,</hi> or <hi>Iambouser,</hi> where abundance of <hi>Indico</hi> is made: and upon the Road to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabat,</hi>
there is to be seen the Sepulchre of a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Saint, named <hi>Pollemedory,</hi> whither
the <hi>Moors,</hi> or <hi>Moguls,</hi> go in pilgrimage with so great devotion, that some of them put Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks
on their mouths to keep them from speaking,<note place="margin">A fabulous miracle.</note> and never take them off, but only when
they are to eat. Others fasten Iron chains to their arms; and it is reported, that the Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks
are opened, and the Chains loosed, by some supernatural power, as soon as they have
accomplish'd their Vows at the Sepulchre.</p>
                  <p>We left <hi>Broitschia</hi> in the Evening,<note place="margin">

bring us half a League out of the City. He return'd thither, but it was to the end he
might overtake us five Leagues thence; for, being entrusted with the management of the
Commerce of <hi>Brodca,</hi> as well as of that of <hi>Broitschia,</hi> he thought fit to go along with the
<hi>Caravan.</hi> We travell'd all night, and the next day, till the extraordinary heat forc'd us to
encamp near a Fish-pond, where we pass'd away the rest of that day, and some part of the
night following, our recreation being to set a dancing the Women that were among the
<hi>Benjans</hi> in the <hi>Caravan.</hi> We went thence after midnight. I intreated the Secretary to
come into my Coach, where I learnt of him several particulars of the Country, which by
reason of my small stay in those parts, it was impossible I could have observed. We pass'd
through the Village of <hi>Karawanet</hi> and <hi>Kabol,</hi> where they made us pay a certain passage-Toll.</p>
                  <p>Being come within some Leagues of the City of <hi>Brodra,</hi>

                     </note> the <hi>English</hi> Secretary went on

about half a League from the City,<note place="margin">OCTOBER</note> whither we came the seventh of <hi>October.</hi> The <hi>Kaffila</hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum,</hi>
to a person of Quality of the Country, whose desire it had been to be there buried
with all his Family. Having taken two or three turns in the Garden, we went to the
Lodge belonging to the <hi>English,</hi> where they made the greatest entertainment imaginable;
and to come to the height of that Countries endearments, they sent for some <hi>Benjan</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who were very desirous to see my cloaths, which I still wore after the <hi>German</hi> fashion,
(though the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are settled in the <hi>Indies,</hi> go ordinarily according to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47786:207"/>
the mode of the Country) and would have oblig'd me to put them off; but perceiving I
was unwilling to do it, and withall that I made some difficulty to accept of the proffers
they made me to strip themselves naked, and to do any thing I would expect from persons
of their sex and profession, they seem'd to be very much troubled, and so went away.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Brodra</hi>

Leagues from <hi>Broitschia.</hi> This City is of no long standing, as having been built by <hi>Rasia
Ghie,</hi> son of <hi>Sulthan Mahomet Begeran,</hi> last King of <hi>Guzuratta,</hi> out of the ruines of the
ancient <hi>Brodra,</hi> which was heretofore called <hi>Radiapora,</hi> from which it is distant about half
a League. It is fortifi'd with good Walls and Bastions, according to the ancient manner
of Fortification, and hath five Gates, one whereof is damm'd up, because there is no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
abuts upon it. The Inhabitants of it, especially those of that part of the Suburbs
which is towards the West-side of the City, are for the most part <hi>Benjans</hi> and <hi>Ketteris</hi> by
profession, Weavers, Dyes, and other workers in Cotton, as being the place where, of all
the Province, the best Clothes are made, which are more close, but a small matter narrower
and shorter then those of <hi>Broitschia;</hi> and it is by that they are distinguished from the
others. There are several sorts thereof, to wit, <hi>Bastas, N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

black <hi>Chelas,</hi> blew <hi>Assamanis, Berams,</hi> and <hi>Tircandias.</hi> We thought fit to name these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
species, that we may the better understand the relations which come daily from those
parts.</p>
                  <p>The jurisdiction of the Governour of <hi>Brodra</hi> extends it self over two hundred and ten
Villages, sixty five whereof are design'd for the maintenance of the Garrison, and the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul</hi>
disposes of the 135. for the advantage and entertainment of certain Officers of the
Court, who have their pensions charg'd upon those Villages. Among which there is one
called <hi>Sindickera,</hi> eight Leagues from the City, which yields yearly above 25000. pounds
of <hi>Lacca.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lacque.</note> This <hi>Lacque</hi> is a Gum taken out of a certain kind of Tree, which is not much

in <hi>Europe,</hi> especially upon black. This Country does also produce much <hi>Indico.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides the Sepulchre we spoke of before,<note place="margin">The Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres of <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Saints.</note> there are many others to be seen without the
City, most of them very magnificently built, having spacious Gardens about them, which
are open for any that would go in.</p>
                  <p>The same day I took leave of the Secretary, and went along with two <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
to the <hi>Caravan,</hi> which we found encamped at the corner of a Grove of the <hi>Palms,</hi>
which bear <hi>Cocos,</hi> and out of which they get <hi>Terry,</hi> which is the ordinary drink of those
parts. In the evening came the <hi>Dutch</hi> Secretary or Deputy of <hi>Brodra,</hi> who presented us
with some bottles of Sack, and kept us company till after midnight.</p>
                  <p>One of the <hi>English</hi> Merchants came along with the <hi>Caravan</hi> as far as <hi>Wasset,</hi> which is
an old Castle partly ruin'd, built upon a high Mountain, where there is kept a Garrison, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of a hundred Horse, who there received a certain Impost of a <hi>Ropia</hi> and a half,
which amounts to somewhat under four shillings, for every Wagon: but we had a Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
from the <hi>Mogul,</hi> by vertue whereof we were to pass without paying, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it was that one of their Merchants came along with the <hi>Caravan</hi> to that place. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the Souldiers of the Garrison staid some of our Wagons, and would have forc'd
us to pay the ordinary duties; but we oppos'd it, and drew up our Convoy, who made their
passage by force. We cross'd the River, and lodg'd in a Village, fortifying our selves with
our Wagons against the attempts which might have been made against us. We found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
that this circumspection was no more then needed. For ere we had quite supped,
came the Receiver with some thirty Souldiers, well arm'd with Half-pikes, Swords, Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and Guns, and desiring a conference with us, we suffered him to enter with three of
his Souldiers; but he demanding the duties of us, we told him, that we were not to pay
any, and that the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Pass freed us; yet to avoid further trouble, and out of our good
will to the Souldiers of the Garrison, we should make them a present of five or six <hi>Ropias.</hi>
They would not hear of any such proposition, and still stood upon the payment of the
whole duty. And so they went away, but with a design to return the next morning, as
indeed they did. At the same time came a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant, who conducted a <hi>Caravan</hi> of
170. Wagons, guarded by 50. Souldiers, all <hi>Indosthans.</hi> He told us that the Souldiers of
the Garrison had fell'd down a great Tree, and laid it cross our way, purposely to hinder
our passage. We immediately commanded out four of our Souldiers to go and clear the
way; which oblig'd those of the Castle to send some of theirs to hinder them: but in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47786:208"/>
regard they could not go by, without coming within reach of our Muskets, we put our
selves into a posture of disputing their passage, and they attempted to force us out of our
retrenchment, which occasion'd the coming back of those whom we had sent to clear the
way. There was some firing on both sides; but we had so much the advantage of them,
that those of the Castle came to a composition, and represented to us by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
that having no other pay then what they receiv'd from the Merchandises passing
that way, they were forc'd to make passengers pay the duties, that they might have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to subsist, and that they would be content with one half of what was ordinarily
received, nay, to avoid further inconvenience, with what we had proffer'd them the day
before; so that they had at last six <hi>Ropias,</hi> which amount to about three Crowns. Their
number, during this contest, encreas'd to a hundred; and the <hi>Indian</hi> Souldiers, who convey'd
us, refused to take up Arms against them, alledging it was not lawful for them to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Souldiers of their Soveraign, and that it was their business to defend us against
the Robbers, who might set upon us in the High-way. Two Leagues and a half thence is
the Village of <hi>Ammenoygii;</hi> and at three and a half further, that of <hi>Sejuntra,</hi> whence we

there for the coming up of the <hi>Caravan,</hi> we sent to the principal Merchant, who mannaged

                     </note> His Coach made after the <hi>Indian</hi> fashion, was gilt all over, covered with several pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of rich <hi>Persian</hi> Tapistry, and drawn by two white Oxen, which express'd as much metal
as we could have expected from the best Horses in <hi>Germany.</hi> There was also led by the
Coach a very stately <hi>Persian</hi> Horse, the harness whereof was covered with plates of Silver.
He took a Collation with us of the little Sack and <hi>English</hi> Beer we had left, after which he
took me into the Coach with him, and brought me to the City, ordering the Merchants to
stay in the Garden till the <hi>Caravan</hi> were come up.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>English</hi> House or Lodge is in the middle of the City, well built, and hath many
fair and convenient Apartments, with spacious Courts for the disposal of Merchandises,
Master <hi>Roberts</hi> brought me first into his own Chamber, which look'd into a little Flower-garden,
in which there was a Fountain. The floor was cover'd with Tapistry, and the
pillars which sustain'd the structure were set out with Silk-stuffes of several colours, and
above, a great white tassel according to the custom of the great Ones of the Country. We
had a Collation; after which he shew'd me the whole house, and brought me into a very
fair Chamber, with a large Closet in it, which he had design'd for my Lodging. We supp'd
in a great Hall, whither the <hi>Dutch</hi> Deputy came after supper to see us, with some of his
Merchants, with whom I had occasion to be acquainted at <hi>Suratta.</hi> After he was gone,
the whole company conducted me to my Chamber, where my Host kept me company till
after midnight. And that there might not be ought wanting in my entertainment (which
in answer to the recommendatory Letters I had brought from the President, he would
needs have in all things extraordinary) he sent for six Women-dancers, the handsomest
could be found in the City, and told me, that if I liked any thing in them besides their sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and activity, I needed only to express my desires, and be confident, that they would give
me all the satisfaction and divertisement which those of their sex are able either to give or
take. I thanked him for his civility, but besides that, I had had some touches of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case
by the way, I made some scruple to meddle in that kind with a <hi>Pagan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They admir'd my cloaths, but above all that Lock of my hair that hung down over my
shoulders: and could hardly be induced to believe I was what I really am.</p>
                  <p>Having slaid two dayes at <hi>Amadabath,</hi> my noble entertainer took me along with him in
a Coach, followed by two others, and shewed me some part of the City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:47786:208"/>
He first brought me to the great Market-place, called <hi>Meydan-Schach,</hi> or the Kings
Market,<note place="margin">The Mey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.</note> which is at least 1600. foot long, and half as many broad, and beset all about with
rows of Palm-trees, and Date-trees, intermix'd with Citron-trees and Orange-trees,
whereof there are very many in the several Sterets: which is not only very pleasant to
the sight, by the delightful prospect it affords, but also makes the walking among them
more convenient, by reason of the coolness. Besides this <hi>Meydan,</hi> there are in the City
four <hi>Basars,</hi> or publick places, where are sold all kinds of Merchandises.</p>
                  <p>The same day,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Castle.</note> I saw also the Castle, which is very large, and built of Free-stone, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that into is one of the most considerable in the Kingdom. Not far from the <hi>Meydan,</hi>
we went into a House built of Brick, which they call the Kings Palace. Over the Gate,
there was a kind of Curtain or Stage, for the Musick, consisting of Violins, Haw-boys and
Bag-pipes, which play there in the morning, at noon, in the evening, and at midnight, as
they do in <hi>Persia,</hi> and all other places, where the Prince professes the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion.
All the Appartments of the House were sumptuous, gilt and adorn'd with painting, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the mode of the Country: but more to their satisfaction, who are pleas'd with
diversity of Colours, then theirs, who look for invention, and stand upon the exactness of
proportions.</p>
                  <p>Then we went out of the City, to see the Walls of it, which are very fair, having twelve
Gates, and many great Towers, with a Ditch sixteen fathom broad, but in many places it is
ruin'd, and without water.</p>
                  <p>We return'd into the City,<note place="margin">A. <hi>Mosquey</hi> of the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans.</hi>
                     </note> to see the principal <hi>Mosquey</hi> of the <hi>Benjans,</hi> which without
dispute is one of the noblest structures that can be seen. It was then new, for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
who was a rich <hi>Benjan</hi> Merchant, named <hi>Santides,</hi> was living in my time. The <hi>Mosquey</hi>
stands in the middle of a great Court, which is enclos'd with a high Wall of Free-stone,
all about which there is a Gallery, much after the manner of our Cloysters in Monasteries,
having all its Seats or Cells, and in every Cell a Marble Statue, white or black, representing
a Woman naked, sitting, and having her legs lying cross under her, according to the mode
of the Countrey. There were some had three Statues, to wit, a great one between two
little ones.</p>
                  <p>At the entrance into the <hi>Mosquey,</hi> there are two Elephants of black Marble done to the
life, and upon one of them the Effigies of the Founder. The whole <hi>Mosquey</hi> is vaulted, and
the Walls adorn'd with several Figures of men and other living Creatures. There was
not any thing within the <hi>Mosquey,</hi> save that at the further end of the Structure there were
three Chappels, or obscure places, divided one from the other by wooden Rails, wherein
might be seen Statues of Marble, like those we had seen in the Cells, with this difference
only, that there was a lighted Lamp before that which stood in the middle. We saw there
also one of their Priests, who was then busie in receiving from the hands of such as came
thither to do their Devotions, Flowers, wherewith he adorn'd his Images, as also Oyl for
the Lamps which hung before the Rails, and Wheat and Salt for the Sacrifice. While he
set the Flowers about the Statues, his mouth and nose were covered with a Linnen-cloath,
left the impurity of his breath should prophane the Mystery, and coming ever and anon
near the Lamp, he mutter'd over certain Prayers, and rub'd his hands up and down in the
flame thereof, as if he had wash'd them in the smoak, and sometimes stroak'd his face with
them. This was a kind of Purification, done out of a perswasion which these people
have, that Fire having a far greater power of purifying then Water, they may after this
Ceremony lift up clean and pure hands to God. But he continued this foolery so long, that
we had not the patience to see the end of it; so that we left him in the midst thereof, to
go and see the Sepulchres, which are the most remarkable Rarities of the City, whereof we
shall here give a short description.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadabath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</hi>
                     </note> the Metropolis of all <hi>Guzuratta,</hi> lies at 23. degrees, 32. minutes on this side
the line, 18. Leagues from <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and 45. from <hi>Suratta,</hi> upon a small River, which not
far thence falls into the <hi>Indus.</hi> It is a very great and populous City, comprehending with
its Suburbs, and the Villages adjacent thereto, which are part of it, near seven Leagues in
compass. The Streets of it are very broad, and both publick and private buildings very
magnificent, especially the <hi>Mosqueys,</hi> and the Governours House of the Province. There
is a Guard kept there day and night, and the Garrison is very considerable, by reason of the
<hi>Badures,</hi> a sort of people distant thence but 25. Leagues, who acknowledge not the <hi>Mogul</hi>
for their Soveraign, and make perpetual incursions upon his Subjects. There is not in a
manner any Nation, nor any Merchandises in all <hi>Asia,</hi> which may not be had at <hi>Amadabath,</hi>
where particularly there are made abundance of Silks and Cotton-stuffs. 'Tis true, they
seldom use any Silk in that Country, much less any out of <hi>Persia,</hi> because it is somewhat
too course and too dear; but they ordinarily make use of that of <hi>China,</hi> which is very
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47786:209"/>
fine, mingling it with that of <hi>Bengala,</hi> which is not quite so fine, but much beyond that of
<hi>Persia,</hi> and much cheaper. They also make there great quantities of Gold and Silver <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes,</hi>
but they put too much thin Lace into them, so that in goodness and substance they
come not near those of <hi>Persia,</hi> though some of them amount in the Country to eighteen
Crowns the Piece.</p>
                  <p>At the time of my being there, they had begun to make a new kind of Stuff of Silk and
Cotton with flowers of Gold, which was very much esteem'd, and sold at five Crowns the
Ell; but the Inhabitants were forbidden the wearing of it, upon this account, that the
King reserv'd it for his own, yet not so strictly, but that he permitted Forraigners to buy of
it, to be transported out of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>They make there also all sorts of Sattins and Velvets of all sorts of colours;<note place="margin">The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities there.</note> Taffata,
Sattins for linings, of both Thread and Silk, Alcatifs or Carpets, the ground Gold, Silk
or Yarn, but not so good as those of <hi>Persia,</hi> and all sorts of Cottons. The other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
to be commonly had there, are Sugar, Candy'd or in Powder, Cummin, Honey,
Lacque, Opium, Borax, Ginger, dry and preserv'd <hi>Myrobalans</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Plums, and all
other sorts of Preserves, Salt-Peter, <hi>Sal armoniack,</hi> and Indico, which the Inhabitants
call <hi>Anil,</hi> and which grows there in great abundance. There are also Diamonds to be
sold there, but in regard they are brought from <hi>Visiapour,</hi> they may be had cheaper else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                  <p>There is also to be had some Amber-greece, and Musk,<note place="margin">Musk and Amber-greece.</note> though the Countrey affords not
any; for the best Amber-greece comes from <hi>Pegu,</hi> and <hi>Bengala,</hi> from <hi>Mosambique</hi> and <hi>Capo
verte,</hi> and is sold at <hi>Amadabath,</hi> at 40. <hi>Momoudis,</hi> or 8. Crowns the ounce. Some are of
opinion, that Amber is the feed of the Whale, hardned or congeal'd by cold in the Sea:
but if this were so, there would be plenty of it found in the North, where men look after
this Fish meerly to get out of it a certain liquor, which is as stinking and infectious as the
smell of the Amber is sweet and pleasant. Nor can I approve of their opinion, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there are within the earth certain veins or sources of Amber, as there are of <hi>Nefte,</hi> or
certain Mines, as those of Brimstone, since there is none to be found but towards the Sea,
wherein it grows as Mushrooms do upon the earth, and is fastned to the bottom, till such
time as the Sea,<note place="margin">A piece of Amber-greece that weighed eighty pound.</note> being tossed up and down by the Winds, casts it towards the shore. <hi>Peter
de la Brouck,</hi> a <hi>Hollander,</hi> who made a Voyage to <hi>Angola, Guinny,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> in the
years 1605. and 1606. sayes in his Relation, that in his time, there was found at <hi>Cabo verde,</hi>
at the mouth of the River <hi>Gambi,</hi> a piece of Amber-greece, which weigh'd eighty pounds,
whereof he bought some part.</p>
                  <p>As for Musk,<note place="margin">Musk.</note> all are joyntly of opinion, that it comes of an Imposthume or Swelling,
which rises about the Navil of a certain Animal, which some affirm to be about the bigness
of a Fox, and others say, is like a Roe-buck. Whether then it be that this rising of the
flesh about that part happens every year, when those Creatures go to rut, and that as they
tumble up and down the Grass it breaks, or that it is cut off when they are taken, certain
it is that it comes from a living Creature, which some Authors call <hi>Gazela;</hi> but the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Pegu</hi> give it another name, which I could not learn, and which is not to be found
in the Relations, or Natural Histories of the East <hi>-Indies.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Michael Boyen,</hi> a Jesuite, who some years since printed, at <hi>Vienna,</hi> a Treatise, which he
calls <hi>La Flore Chinoise,</hi> sayes, that the right Musk is made of the Kidneys and Testicles of
that Animal, which he calls <hi>Hiam,</hi> but that the <hi>China</hi> Merchants, who adulterate most of
their Merchandises, put among it some of the flesh and bloud of the said Animal, and so
make up a kind of composition, wherewith they fill the little Purses made of the Skin of
the same Beast, which the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Popos,</hi> and endeavour to make them pass for the
right Cods. However this may hold, certain it is, that this excellent scent proceeds from a
Beast, and that it may be called the soul of all Perfume. But there is not any thing so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
as the convenience which this place affords for matter of exchange, the <hi>Benjans</hi>
having their Correspondents in all parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> even at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and this is so much
the more to the advantage of the Merchant, the more he stands in fear of the <hi>Rasboutes,</hi>
and other Robbers, who make travelling very dangerous, notwithstanding all the expence
the <hi>Mogul</hi> is at, to maintain a great number of Souldiers, who are particularly kept for the
safety of the High-wayes.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing paid here,<note place="margin">Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses pay no duties or custom at <hi>Amadabat.</hi>
                     </note> either at the exportation or importation of Merchandises,

sorts of Merchandises, those only excepted which are prohibited, as Gun-powder, Lead
and Salt-Peter, which may not be transported without the Governours permission; but
that it is no hard matter to obtain, making but a slender acknowledgment of his favour
therein.</p>

The City of <hi>Amadabat</hi> comprehends within its territory twenty five great Towns, and
two thousand nine hundred ninety and eight Villages,<note place="margin">Its jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and revenue.</note> so as that the revenue thereof amounts
to above six millions of Crowns, whereof the Governour hath the disposal, and therewith
maintains the Souldiers, whom he is oblig'd to keep for the Kings service, especially against
Robbers upon the high-wayes; though many times he protects them, and divides the
booty with them. The <hi>Couteval,</hi> who is as it were the King Lieutenant, commands under
the <hi>Sulthan,</hi> and mannages the political Government, nay meddles also with the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Justice joyntly with the <hi>Kasi</hi> or ordinary Judge. The <hi>Mogul</hi> hath there also
several other Officers, who are as it were Controllers and Supervisors of those we last
named.</p>
                  <p>The dayes following I spent in seeing the Sepulchres which are about the City, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others,<note place="margin">The Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of a <hi>Kasi.</hi>
                     </note> particularly that which is in the Village of <hi>Zirkees,</hi> about a League and a
half from <hi>Amadabat.</hi> 'Tis the work of a King of <hi>Guzuratta,</hi> built by him to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a <hi>Kasi,</hi> who had been his <hi>Praeceptor,</hi> and is grown very famous upon the account of
many pretended Miracles done by him after his death. The whole Structure, wherein
there are four hundred and forty great pillars, thirty foot high, is of Marble, as also the
floor of it, and serves for a Sepulchre to three other Kings, who would needs be buried
there with their Families. At the entrance of this sumptuous Monument, there is a large
<hi>Tanke,</hi> or Cistern, full of water, and enclos'd with a wall, which hath several windows all
about it. The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of those parts go on Pilgrimage thither; and in this Village
of <hi>Zirkees</hi> is made the best Indico in all the Country. About a League thence, there is
a spacious Garden, with a fair House within it, which the <hi>Mogul, Chon Chimauw,</hi> built, in
memory of a Victory gained by him in that place over <hi>Sulthan Mahomed Begeran,</hi> last
King of <hi>Guzuratta,</hi> upon which he united that Kingdom to his Crown, as we shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>About a League and a half from the City, we were shewn a Sepulchre, which they call
<hi>Betti-Chuit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of an incestuous Father.</note> that is to say, <hi>thy daughters shame discovered.</hi> There lies interr'd in it a rich
Merchant, a Moor, named <hi>Hajam Majom,</hi> who falling in love with his own Daughter, and
desirous to shew some pretence for his incest, went to an Ecclesiastical Judge, and told him
in general terms, That he had in his youth, taken the pleasure to plant a Garden, and to
dress and order it with great care, so that now it brought forth such excellent fruits, that
his neighbours were extreamly desirous thereof, that he was every day importuned to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
unto them, but that he could not yet be perswaded to part therewith, and that
it was his design to make use of them himself, if the Judge would grant him in writing a
Licence to do it. The <hi>Kasi,</hi> who was not able to dive into the wicked intentions of this
unfortunate man, made answer, That there was no difficulty in all this, and so immediately
declar'd as much in writing. <hi>Hajom</hi> shewed it his Daughter, and finding nevertheless, that
neither his own authority, nor the general permission of the Judge, would make her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to his brutal enjoyments, he ravished her. She complain'd to her Mother, who made
so much noise about it, that the King <hi>Mahomet Begeran</hi> coming to hear thereof, ordered
him to lose his head.</p>
                  <p>Not far from <hi>Amadabat</hi> begin to appear the dreadful Mountains of <hi>Marva,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Marva.</hi>

Horse into the Field.</p>
                  <p>In the Mountain which lies between <hi>Amadabat</hi> and <hi>Trappe,</hi> there lives another <hi>Radia,</hi>
who is not subject to the <hi>Mogul,</hi> by reason the Woods and Deserts secure him against that
Prince, who with all his power is not able to force him out of the places he is possess'd of,
no more then he is the <hi>Radia</hi> of <hi>Ider,</hi> who is his Vassal, but many times refuses to obey his
Orders.</p>
                  <p>One of the noblest Gardens about the City is that of <hi>Schach-bag,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Schach-bag <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
                     </note> in that part of the
Suburbs which is called <hi>Begampour.</hi> It is the King Garden, very spacious, encompass'd
with a high Wall, and hath within it a very fair House, the Ditches whereof are full of
water, and the appartments richly furnish'd. I went thence along a Stone-bridge, which
is four hundred paces in length, to another Garden, called <hi>Niccinabag,</hi> that is to say, the
Jewel, and they say it was planted by a beautiful and rich young Lady. The Garden is
not very great no more then the House within it; but both very advantageously seated in
a place high enough to discover all the adjacent Champion, and upon the avenues of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47786:210"/>
Bridge, to make the noblest prospect that ever I saw. The Rain which falls in the Winter
time supplyes a great Fish-poud or Pool in the middle of the Garden, but in Summer
they make use of certain Engines, wherewith many Oxen put together draw up the
water out of Wells, which are so deep, that they are never dry. A man can seldom go to
this Garden, but he shall find some young Women bathing themselves, they will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
the <hi>Indians</hi> should see them, but suffered us to come in and speak to them.</p>
                  <p>There are so many other Gardens about <hi>Amadabat,</hi> and the whole City is so full of
Trees, that a man may say, it makes all but one Garden; for as he comes to the City, he sees
such abundance of them, that he may well think he is going into a Forrest. Among other
things I took particular notice of the High-way, which they call <hi>Bascaban,</hi> and leads to a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
six Leagues distant from the City. It is so straight, that it should seem they took a great
pleasure in planting the Trees about it, whereof there is a double row on both sides upon a
straight line. They are <hi>Cocos</hi>-Trees, which at all times refresh Travellers with their shade:
but this road comes nothing near that which goes from <hi>Agra</hi> to <hi>Barampour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An Ally 150 Leagues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> which makes
but one continued Ally for a hundred and fifty <hi>Germans</hi> Leagues together. All these
Teees lodge and feed an incredible number of Apes, among which there are some as big as
Greyhounds, and strong enough to set upon a Man; but they never do it unless they be
angred. They are most of them of a greenish brown colour, and their beards and eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows
long and white. They multiply extreamly, by reason the <hi>Benjans,</hi> who are much
more numerous in those parts then the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> believe the <hi>Metempsychosis,</hi> or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration
of souls, and permit not the killing of beasts, and these much less then any other,
because they have some resemblance of Man, and are perswaded, that the merriest and best
humour'd souls, after their departure out of the body, retire into these Creatures; whence
it comes that the City is full of them. They come into people houses at any time with all
the freedom imaginable, and in so great numbers, that those who sell Fruits and Preserves
have much ado to keep them from their houses, and to secure their Ware. I remember
one day I counted above fifty at the <hi>English</hi> house at the same time, which fell a playing
and putting themselves into several postures, as if they had been sent thither purposely to
make me sport. I one day chanc'd do cast some Dates and Almonds among two or three
Apes that came in, which they liked so well, that they waited every morning at my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
door for their Breakfast, and became at last so familiar, that they would take Fruit, or
Bread, or any thing else out of my hand. I would sometimes catch one of them by the
Foot, so to oblige the others to snarle at me, and as it were to demand their Companion,
which I did till such time as I saw them make ready to set upon me, so to force him out of
my hands.</p>
                  <p>The same Trees maintain all sorts of wild Fowl,<note place="margin">Parrots.</note> but especially an infinite number of
Parrots, whereof there are several kinds. The biggest are called <hi>Indian</hi> Crows. Some
are all white, or of a Pearl colour, having on their Crowns a tuft of Feathers of a Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
red, and they are called <hi>Kahatou,</hi> from that word which in their chattering they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
very distinctly. These Birds are common all over the <hi>Indies,</hi> where they make
their Nests in Cities, under the Eaves of Houses, as Swallows do in <hi>Europe.</hi> The lesser
sort of them, which are the more valued for the beauty and diversity of their colours, their
Feathers being checquer'd between a lively Carnation and a bright Green, build their Nests
in the Woods, and fasten them to the tops of the branches, so as that they hang in the

them. They build their Nests with Hay or Stubble, and many times they fasten two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
with a covering above, and another beneath. These Birds are a great annoyance
to the Fruits, and do much mischief in the Rice, because none kill them; nay, the <hi>Benjans</hi>
are so supertitious as not to hinder them from eating; which freedom they also give the
wild Ducks, Herons and Cormorants,<note place="margin">Cormorants.</note> whereof there are abundance abut the River. In
the precedent Travels of the Embassadours into <hi>Muscovy</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> there is some mention
of these Birds, upon occasion of those which we saw upon the River <hi>Wolga;</hi> We shall only
add here, that it is the same kind of Fowl, that the Natural Histories call <hi>Onocratalus,</hi> from
the noise it makes in the Water, when it puts its Beak into it, imitating in some sort the
braying of an Ass. It hath the subtilty to swallow down Muscles, and keep them in the
Stomach till the heat thereof hath opened the shell, and then cast them up again to take
out the Fish.</p>
                  <p>There is no kind of wild Fowl, nor Venison,<note place="margin">Fowl and Venison.</note> which may not be had in these Forrests, but

                     </note> as to

River but is pester'd with abundance of Crocodiles,<note place="margin">Crocodiles.</note> called by the Inhabitants <hi>Cayman,</hi>
which do much mischief, as well in the Water, as upon the Land among the Cattle, nay,
sometimes among Men, whom they surprise when they go a swimming, or when they go
in Boats near the shore; this Creature being so nimble, that a Man hath much ado to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
by running, though it were no hard matter for him, by frequent turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to avoid his pursuit: for the Crocodile having no <hi>Vertebrae</hi> or joynts either in his
neck or back, he cannot turn himself, and thence it comes that most commonly he rather
surprises Men then pursues them. He commonly lurks in the high Grass on the River
side, to catch at those who come for Water; and the <hi>Benjans,</hi> who believe that the Souls
of those who are thus devour'd by these Creatures, are immediately admitted into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
take no course to destroy them. It is very certain, that in the Ditches of the City of
<hi>Pegu</hi> there were Crocodiles above thirty foot in length,<note place="margin">Crocodiles 30. foot long.</note> and fed so much upon Mans flesh,
that no day pass'd but they devour'd some or other, and yet the <hi>Benjans</hi> took no course in
the world to prevent it and destroy them.<note place="margin">A Crocodile swallows a woman with all her cloaths.</note> But the King having caused one to be more

They cover their Eggs, having laid to the number of 28 or 30. with Sand, about the
change of the Moon, and so leave them till the wane, by which time they are hatch'd;
when they uncover them,<note place="margin">How they lay their Eggs.</note> they kill a great many of the young ones, which hinders them
from multiplying, as they would do otherwise to infinity. <hi>Iohnston</hi> in his <hi>Natural History</hi>
saith, that near <hi>Panama,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Crocodiles 100. foot long.</note> in the West-<hi>Indies,</hi> there were found Crocodiles above a hundred
foot long. But we shall not here make a digression into Natural History, and ingenuosly
acknowledge, that those we saw were about twelve or fifteen foot long. The skin, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
scales of their backs is harder then Armour musket-proof; so that to destroy them,
a man must go on one side of them, and run them into the belly. The Inhabitants of the
Country affirm, that this Creature is of its own nature cowardly, and that it avoids those
who stand to it, and hath courage only when it hath to do with those that have not any,
and run away from it.</p>
                  <p>Another quality which this Country hath, not common with all places, is, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
abundance of Snakes and Serpents,<note place="margin">Serpents.</note> which are here very dangerous, and among the
rest those, which from a Greek word are called <hi>Amphisbenes,</hi> and have two heads. I must
confess I never saw any of them, and expect not that upon my testimony any should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the opinion of those, who with much probability affirm, that Nature produces no
Creature with two heads, unless she intend to make sport, and frame a Monster; and that
their errour, who speak of the <hi>Amphisbene,</hi> proceeds only hence, that they have seen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
which, contrary to the ordinary form of all Reptiles, are as big towards the tail as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the head. We might also very well esteem those somewhat ridiculously conceited,
who would have people believe, that these heads command' and obey alternately by years,
if those of the Country did not affirm as much, and if <hi>Nirembergius,</hi> in his Natural Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
write, that an Inhabitant of <hi>Madrid,</hi> named <hi>Cortavilla,</hi> had assur'd him that he had seen
it: but he doth not himself believe what he adds to that Story; to wit, that this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

was content commonly with a Garment of Cotton, as are the other <hi>Indosthans,</hi> unless it
were when he went abroad into the City, or took a journey into the Country; for then
he went in great state, sitting ordinarily in a rich Chair, set upon an Elephant, cover'd with

                     <hi>October</hi> 18. I went along with the <hi>English</hi> Merchant to visit the Governour,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mandelslo</hi> visits the Governour of <hi>Amada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</hi>
                     </note> whom we
found sitting in a Pavilion or Tent which look'd into his Garden. Having caused us to sit
down by him, he asked the Merchant who I was: He told him in the <hi>Indosthan</hi> Language,
that I was a Gentleman of <hi>Germany,</hi> whom a desire to see forreign Countries, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
himself by Travel, had oblig'd to leave his own. That coming into <hi>Persia,</hi> upon
occasion of an Embassie sent thither by the Prince my Master, I took a resolution to see the
<hi>Indies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> as being the noblest Country in the world; and being come to that City, that I
hoped he would not take it ill if I aspir'd to the honour of waiting upon him. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
made answer, I was very welcome, that my resolution was noble and generous, and
that he pray'd God to bless and prosper it. He thereupon asked me, whether during my
aboad in <hi>Persia,</hi> I had learnt ought of the Language. I reply'd, that I had a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to the <hi>Turkish</hi> Language, and that I understood it so far as to make a shift to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
my self in it. The Governour, who was a <hi>Persian</hi> born, made answer, that it was
true indeed, the <hi>Turkish</hi> Language was much more commonly spoken in the <hi>Scach</hi>'s Court
then that of the Country, and thereupon asked me my age, and how long it was since I left
<hi>Germany.</hi> I told him I was 24. years of age, and that I had travelled three years. He
reply'd, that he wondred very much my friends would suffer me to travel so young, and
and asked me whether I had not chang'd my habit by the way; whereto having made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that I had not, he told me, that it was an extraordinary good fortune, that I had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
in that equipage through so many Countries, without meeting with some unhappy
accident, and that the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> to prevent any such misfortune, clad themselves
according to the fashion of the Country.</p>
                  <p>After about an hours discourse, we would have risen and taken our leaves of him, but the
Governour intreated us to stay and dine with him. He caused some Fruit to be brought,
while his people were laying the cloath, which was of Cotton, laid upon a large Carpet of
red <hi>Turkie</hi>-leather. The dinner was very noble, and serv'd up and dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t according to the
<hi>Persian</hi> way, the Meat being laid in dishes, all Porcelane, upon Rice of several colours, in the
same manner as we had seen at the Court at <hi>Ispahan.</hi> Presently after dinner we came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
but as I was taking my leave of the Governour, he told me in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Language,
<hi>Senni dahe kurim,</hi> that is to say, we shall see you again, giving me thereby to understand, that
he would be glad of some further discourse with me.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly we went thither again the 20.<note place="margin">A second visit to the Governour.</note> but I had clad my self according to the
mode of the Country, upon the design I had to travel into <hi>Cambaya,</hi> which I could hardly
do without changing habit. We found him in the same appartment where we had seen
him the time before. He was clad in a White Vestment, according to the <hi>Indian</hi> mode,
over which he had another that was longer, of <hi>Brocadoe,</hi> the ground Carnation lined with
white Satin, and above, a Collar of Sables, whereof the Skins were sewed together, so as
that the Tails hung down over the back. As soon as he saw us come in, he made us sit
down by the Lords that were with him. He was about some business, which hindred him
for a while from discoursing with us, yet could I not but observe that he was pleased at my
change of habit. He dispatch'd several Orders, and sometimes writ himself; yet did not
his business take him up, so as to hinder him from taking Tobacco, which he took after the
same manner as is elsewhere described in the precedent Travels of the Embassadours, there
standing near him a Servant, who with one hand held to the Pipe to his mouth, and set fire
to it with the other. He quitted that exercise to go and take a view of certain Troops of
Horse and Companies of Foot, which were drawn up in the Court. He would see their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47786:211"/>
Armes himself, and caus'd them to shoot at a Mark, thereby to judge of their abilities, and
to augment the pay of such as did well at the cost of the others, out of whose pay there
was so much abated. So that seeing him thus employ'd, we would have taken our leaves,
but he sent us word that we should dine with him, causing in the mean time some Fruit to
be sent us, whereof by his order we sent the best part to our Lodging.</p>
                  <p>Soon after he call'd for a little golden Cabinet, enrich'd with precious Stones, and having
taken out two Drawers, out of one he took <hi>Offion,</hi> or <hi>Opium,</hi> and out of the other <hi>Bengi,</hi>
a certain Drug, or Powder, made of the leaves and seed of Hemp, which they use to excite
luxury. Having taken a small spoonful of each, he sent the Cabinet to me, and told me,
that it could not otherwise be, but that, during my aboad at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> I must needs have
learnt the use of the Drug, and that I should find that as good as any I had seen in <hi>Persia.</hi>
I told him, that I was no competent Iudge of it, in regard I had not used it often; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I would then take of it for the Honours sake of receiving it from his hands. I took
of it, and the <hi>English</hi> Merchant did the like, though neither of us had ever taken any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
nor did much like it then.</p>
                  <p>The Governour ask'd me, where I had learnt the <hi>Turkish</hi> Language, and whether I had
ever been at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> I told him, I never had been there, but had employ'd the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time of my aboad in the Provinces of <hi>Schirwan,</hi> and at <hi>Ispahan,</hi> in learning that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,<note place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madabat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>wan</hi> was
his Country, and understanding that I had been particularly known to <hi>Schach Sefi,</hi> had
dined at his Table, and been a hunting with him, he ask'd my judgment of the King of
<hi>Persia,</hi> and what I thought worthy commendation or censure in that Prince? I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that he was a Prince of a graceful Aspect and Person, and one that had understanding
and courage enough to be obey'd in his Kingdom.<note place="margin">But loves not the King of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </note> He ask'd me, whether he still reign'd
as a Tyrant, and continu'd his former cruelties? I answered, that Age having moderated
his youthful extravagancies, his government began to be also more moderate.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Chan</hi> reply'd, that <hi>Schach Sefi</hi> had assum'd the Scepter with bloudy hands, and
that the beginning of his reign had cost the lives of an infinite number of persons, of all
conditions and qualities: That Cruelty was hereditary to his Family: That it descended
to him from <hi>Scach-Abas,</hi> his Grand-father, and that there was little hope he could rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of a quality that was become in a manner natural to him, though he might happily
dissemble it for a time: That that was the only reason for which <hi>Alymerdan-Chan,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Candahar,</hi> had been forc'd to cast himself into the protection of the <hi>Mogul,</hi> and to
deliver up his place to him; as knowing his life was in danger, though he had never done
ought against the service of his Prince, and that he was sent for to Court, to augment the
number of those Lords whom that Tyrant had put to death: That he was content to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

between the Gold, and the Silver, and Wealth of <hi>Persia,</hi> and what I had already seen of
the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Kingdom; but that it must be withall confess'd, that <hi>Persia</hi> had one thing
which could not be had elsewhere, and was in effect inestimable, which was the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Kisilbachs,</hi> with whose assistance the King of <hi>Persia</hi> might attempt the conquest of
all <hi>Asia.</hi> Which I said purposely, knowing the Governour was a <hi>Kisilbach,</hi> and that he
could take no offence at such a discourse. Accordingly he discover'd his satisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
not only in saying, that he must grant it to be true, but also, when turning to one of the
Lords, who was a <hi>Persian</hi> as well as himself, he said to him, <hi>Walla beksade, jasehi a-damdur,
chassa adamlar souer,</hi> that is to say, I believe this young Gentleman hath courage, when he
speaks so well of those that have.</p>
                  <p>By that time we had ended this discourse dinner was brought in. The Carver sate in
the middle of the great Vessels wherein the meat was brought up, and with a great spoon
put of it into little dishes, to be serv'd up to us. The <hi>Cban</hi> himself would needs also put
in some, to assure us of his being pleas'd with our company. The room was full of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Officers, whereof some stood with Half-pikes in their hands, others sate about a <hi>Tanke</hi>
or Cistern which was in the room.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after dinner we took leave, but the Governour told us, that he intended to
give us the divertisement of the Women-dancers of the Country, and that we should pass
away the afternoon with him: but some business intervening he could not do it then, and
therefore was forc'd to put it off to some other time. But the earnestess I was in to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> but hasty, and so
rigorous, that his Government inclin'd somewhat to cruelty. It happened one day, that
the two principal Directors of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> trade there, being invited by him to
dinner; a young Gentleman that waited upon the former, comes into the Hall to attend
upon his Master; He had on a slash'd doublet, much after the fashion which was worn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
30. years since, which the Governour thought so ridiculous, that he could not forbear
laughing at it, and askt the <hi>English</hi> President, in what quality that slash'd Gallant serv'd
him, since that according to his habit, he conceiv'd he kept him for his Fool. The Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
made answer, not without some confusion, that he waited on him in his Chamber, and
that he had opened his Doublet in that manner to make way for the Air, the better to avoid
the excessive heats of the Country, which the <hi>Europaeans</hi> could not well endure. Whereto
the Governour reply'd, that that reason gave some satisfaction, but what he most wondred
at was, that the <hi>Christians,</hi> who are a wise and understanding people, had not yet found out
the way to make their Doublets of several shreds, rather then cut and mangle whole pieces
of Stuffes to put themselves into that mode. This jesting with the <hi>English</hi> Merchant put
him into so good an humour, that he would needs devote the remainder of the day to sport
and divertisement, and thereupon sent for twenty Women-dancers, who as soon as they
were come into the room fell a singing and dancing, but with an Activity and exact obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the cadence, much beyond that of our Dancers upon the Ropes. They had little

and made thousands of Postures, according to the several soundings of their Musick, which
consisted of a <hi>Tumbeck,</hi> or Timbrel, a Haw-boy, and several Tabours. Having danc'd
near two hours, the Governour would needs send into the City for another band of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
but the Servants brought word, that they were sick and could not come. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
being not taken, he sent out the same Servants, with express order to bring those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
away by force; but they returning the second time with the same excuse, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
they should be cudgell'd. Upon that, they cast themselves at the Governours feet,
and acknowledged that it was indeed true, they were not sick, but were at a certain place,
where they got Money at a more delightful and easier sport then dancing, and that they
absolutely deny'd to come, saying, they knew well enough the Governour would not pay
them. He laught at it, but immediately commanded out a party of his Guard to bring
them to him, and they were no sooner entred into the Hall ere he ordered their heads to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

obey'd, and caus'd the execution to be done in the room before all the Company, not one
of the Lords then present daring to make the least intercession for those Wretches, who
were eight in number. The Strangers were startled at the horrour of the Spectacle and
inhumanity of the Action; which the Governour taking notice of, fell a laughing, and
ask'd them what they were so much startled at? Assure your selves Gentlemen, said he,
that if I should not take this course, I should not be long Governour of <hi>Amadabat.</hi> For
should I connive once at their disobedience, these <hi>Bete-Seioth,</hi> or Sons of Whores, would
play the Masters, and drive me out of the City. 'Tis but prudence in me to prevent their
contempt of my Authority, by such examples of severity as these are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>October</hi> 21. I left <hi>Amadabat,</hi> with a Coach and one Saddle-nag, in the company of a
young <hi>English</hi> Merchant, who, by order from the President, was to be my Fellow-travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.
The <hi>Rasboutes</hi> make the way between <hi>Amadabath</hi> and <hi>Cambaya</hi> very dangerous,
which made me take for my Convoy eight Foot-souldiers arm'd with Pikes and Bucklers.
This kind of Souldiers do also the office of Lacqueys, running just before the Horses, and
may be hired for a small matter; for I gave them but eight Crowns for the whole jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
though I had them three dayes, in which time I travell'd thirteen of the Country
Leagues.</p>
                  <p>All the <hi>English</hi> Merchants brought me half a League out of the City, where I saw a
sumptuous Tomb,<note place="margin">Tschictbag <hi>Garden.</hi>
                     </note> which they call <hi>Salu.</hi> I got that day to the Garden of <hi>Tschictbag,</hi>
made in memory of the place where the Sulthan <hi>Mahomet Begoran,</hi> whom we spoke of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
was defeated, and is without all comparison the fairest of any in the <hi>Indies;</hi> but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dark ere I got thither, I shall forbear the description of it till my return that way, at
which time I had the convenience of taking a particular view thereof.</p>
                  <p>The 22. Having travell'd seven Leagues, I came to the Village of <hi>Serguntra,</hi> where,
saw not any thing remarkable, but a great <hi>Tanke,</hi> or Cistern, wherein rain-water is kept all
the year.</p>
                  <p>The 23. After five Leagues travelling, I came to <hi>Cambaya.</hi> I din'd in sight of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47786:212"/>
City among certain Trees, and in the mean time sent one of my Foot-souldiers to a <hi>Brocker,</hi>
that is to say, one of those <hi>Benjans,</hi> whom the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> make use of as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
and who understand their Language, together with the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> which they
learnt by means of the great Commerce that Nation hath had all over the <hi>Indies.</hi> He
immediately came in a Coach, and having brought me into the City, lodg'd me at a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan</hi>
Merchants, where I was very well accommodated; which course I took, because
the <hi>English</hi> Factor being from home, I made some difficulty to lodge at the <hi>English</hi> House.
As soon as I was got into the City, I desir'd the <hi>Brocker</hi> to shew me what was most worth
the seeing there.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Cambaya</hi> lies 16. Leagues from <hi>Broitsc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Cambaya <hi>described.</hi>
                     </note> in a sandy place upon the River
side, which makes there a great Bay, into which the River <hi>May,</hi> having past by the Walls
thereof, disembogues it self. The Haven is incommodious, though at High-water there
be above seven fathom water; but at Low-water, the Ships lye dry in the Sand and Mud
that is at the bottom. The City is encompass'd by a very fair Wall of Free-stone, and
hath twelve Gates, very large houses, and strait and broad streets, most whereof have Gates
which are shut up in the night time. It is much greater then <hi>Surat,</hi> as being at least ten
Leagues about. It hath three <hi>Basars</hi> or Market-places, and four noble <hi>Tanks</hi> or Cisterns,
able to find the Inhabitants water all the year long.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants are for the most part <hi>Pagans, Benjans,</hi> or <hi>Rasboutes,</hi> whereof some apply
themselves to Commerce, others to a military life. Their greatest traffick is at <hi>Achim, Diu,
Goa, Meca,</hi> and into <hi>Persia,</hi> whither they carry all sorts of Stuffes of Silk and Cotton, and
bring back ready Money, both Gold and Silver, to wit, <hi>Ducats, Chequins and Ryals;</hi> also
<hi>Ruynas,</hi> Dates, and other Commodities of those parts. After a walk of two hours, my
Conductor carried me out of the City, and shewed me 15. or 16. publick Gardens, but
among the rest, one, into which I went on that side that was towards the Sea, by a pair of
stairs of Free-stone of many steps. It was enclos'd with a high Wall, and had in it two or
three fair Structures, one whereof being over the Gate, had many noble Appartments. In
the midst of the Garden there is a very high place, within which was the Sepulchre of the
<hi>Mahumetan</hi> who had founded it, and was there buried with all his Family. The Tomb
was covered with Marble, and had several <hi>Arabian</hi> Inscriptions: There is not any place
in all those parts that hath so noble a prospect as this, not only towards the Sea-side, but
also towards the Land, where a man hath the sight of the noblest Champion Country in
the World. This is so pleasant a place, that the <hi>Mogul</hi> being one day at <hi>Cambaya,</hi> would
needs take up his Lodging in the Garden, and caused the Stones of the Sepulchre to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, that his Tent might be pitch'd there.</p>
                  <p>While I was taking a particular view of that Structure, came up to us two <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who obligingly reproach'd me with the slurre I put upon their Nation, in preferring
the House of a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> before their Lodge, as if I had been but poorly entertain'd at
<hi>Suratta,</hi> and other places, where I had lodg'd among them. They proffered me their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to walk, and promised to carry me the next morning to a place, where an <hi>Indian</hi> Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
was to be burnt, with her own consent.</p>
                  <p>I went at night to my Lodging, whither the <hi>Brocker</hi> brought several <hi>Alcatifs,</hi> or pieces of
Tapistry, quilted Coverlets, Silk-stuffes, Cottons, Vessels, Handles for Knives, Seals, Bracelets,
Rings and Buttons of Agat, Cornelian and Jasper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all sorts of colours, which
pleased me very well; but not being in a condition to spare any money, I only bought
some few trifles, to keep in favour with my Merchant.</p>
                  <p>The next day, the <hi>English</hi> Merchants came to my Lodging, whence we went together to
the River side,<note place="margin">An <hi>Indian</hi> Widow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

causing her self to be burnt alive; but whereas the <hi>Mogul</hi> and his Officers are <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
who endeavour by degrees to abolish this heathenish and barbarous Custom, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
had a long time oppos'd her desires, under pretence that the news of her Husbands
death being uncertain, he could not consent to the doing of an inhumane action, whereof
there would afterwards haply be cause to repent. The Governours design was to see, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time would abate any thing of her passion, and the earnestness she was in to follow her
Husband into the other World: but seeing she was daily more and more instant to do it,
he permitted her to comply with the Laws of her own Religion.</p>
                  <p>She was not above twenty years of age, yet we saw her come up to the place of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
with so much confidence, and a chearfulness so extraordinary to those who go to
present and inevitable death, that I was much inclin'd to believe, that she had dull'd her
senses with a dose of <hi>Opium,</hi> which is as commonly used in the <hi>Indies</hi> as in <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

In the front of the Procession marched the Country Musick, consisting of Haw-boys and
and Timbrels. Then follow'd a great many Maids and Women, singing and dancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Widow, who was drest in her richest Cloathing, and had her Fingers, her Armes
and Legs loaden with Rings, Bracelets and Carkanets. After her came a confused compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Men, Women and Children, and so concluded the Procession. She made a stop at the
Funeral Pile, which had been purposely erected for the Ceremony. The Woman had wash'd
her self in the River, that she might meet her Husband in a state of Purity, in regard the
body of the deceased being not upon the place, she could not accompany it in its passage
into the other World. The Pile was of the wood of Apricock-trees, among which they
had put in some Sanders and Cinnamon. Having look'd upon it with a certain contempt,
she took leave of her Kindred and Friends, and distributed among them the Rings and
Bracelets she had about her. I was something near her on horseback, with the two <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Merchants, and I think she perceiv'd in my countenance that I pitied her, whence it
came that she cast me one of her Bracelets, which I had the good hap to catch, and still
keep, in remembrance of so extraordinary an Action.</p>
                  <p>As soon as she was got upon the Pile, they set fire to it, which she perceiving, pour'd on
her head a Vessel of persum'd Oly, which the fire immediately taking hold of, she was smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
in an instant, so as that she was not perceiv'd to make the least wry face at it. Some
that were present cast upon her several Cruses of Oyl, which soon reduc'd the body to
ashes, while the rest of the Assembly fill'd the Air with their cries and shouts, such as must
needs have hindred those of the Widow to be heard, if she had the time to make any in
the fire, which had made a sudden dispatch of her as if it had been Lighting. The Ashes
were cast into the River.</p>
                  <p>I was told,<note place="margin">How the custom come up.</note> that this barbarous Custom had been introduc'd among the Pagans of those
parts upon this account, that Polygamy occasioning much heart-burning among the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
arising either from the little satisfaction they could have from a man, who is oblig'd
to divide his affections, or the jealousie, which is unavoidable among Rivals of that Sex;
it happened that the Women procur'd their Husbands death; and 'twas found, that in
one year there had been four Men buried for one Woman; so that to oblige them to be
careful of their Husbands lives, it was ordered, that such as were desirous to be accounted
honest Women, should be ingag'd to accompany their Husbands at their death, and to be
burnt together with their bodies. Certain it is, that the <hi>Persians,</hi> and other neighbouring
Nations, have ever had so particular a veneration for the fire, that it is not to be admir'd
they should chuse rather to reduce their deceased to ashes, then bury them. I say, this Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of dying with their Husbands was imposed only on those Women who stood upon
the reputation of honesty, yet so as they were engag'd thereto only by a principle of honour,
there being not any punishment to be inflicted on such as refused to follow them in that
dreadful journey, other then that they were not admitted into the company of Persons of
quality, as being looked on as infamous Women. They who are not so scrupulous, and stand
not so much upon the punctilio of Honour, and prefer their lives before their reputation, do
ordinarily strike in among the publick Dancers.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremony being over, I went to see one of the chiefest Merchants of the City, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Myrsabeg,</hi> to whom I had Letters of recommendation from the Director of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Commerce at <hi>Amadabat.</hi> He was not at home, but I found him on the River side look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on some Workmen he had about a Ship which was then a building. He receiv'd the
Letters with much civility, and having caused me to sit down by him, he enquired after my
health, the success of my Travels, and the Design I was engaged in. He was a <hi>Mahum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and spoke to me at first by the means of my Interpreter; but having learnt from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
I understood the <hi>Turkish</hi> Language, he would make no further use of the <hi>Brocker,</hi> and spoke
to me in that. I told him, that I had not met with any misfortune by the way, and that I
intended to be gone the next morning, as having no further business that might detain me
at <hi>Cambaya,</hi> and that I had not stayed there that day, had it not been for the honour of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him,<note place="margin">The Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an <hi>Indosthan Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi>
                     </note> and delivering him the Letters directed to him. He made answer, that it very much
troubled him, that the small stay I intended to make at <hi>Cambaya,</hi> permitted him not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
what he would do for me, not only upon the account of the Letters I had brought
him from his Friend, but also upon that of my own merit.</p>
                  <p>While we were engaged in these Complements, came up to us the Kings Lieutenant,
who alighting, saluted me with much civility. Having made the same questions to me as the
Merchant had done before, and receiv'd the same answer I had made the other, he told me,
I should do him a great kindness, if I gave him a visit at his own Lodgings, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to do. <hi>Myrsabeg</hi> told me, that he would come, and know of me, wherein he
might serve me, and so I took leave of them both, with a design to spend the remainder
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47786:213"/>
of the morning in walking about the City. As I rose from dinner were brought in the
Presents of <hi>Myrsabeg,</hi> which were two Muttons, twelve Capons and Pullets, a basket of

and told him, I would not fail coming to thank his Master. I thought to have
done it the next morning, but he prevented me, and surpriz'd me, giving order for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.
He told me, it would have troubled him much, I should have departed ere he
had taken leave of me. I thank'd him for the honour he did me, and the Presents he had
sent me, and intreated him to accept of a Pocket-pistol, made at <hi>London,</hi> which was a very
neat one, excusing my self, that as to the condition I was then in, it was impossible for me to
acknowledge, as I would desire, the kindness he had shewn me. He made answer, that it
was unhandsome to receive Presents from a Stranger, but that it would be a greater incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to refuse what I proffer'd him, that he was far from deserving what I then made him,
but being bestow'd with so much kindness and obligation, he could by no means forbear
accepting of it.</p>
                  <p>I give a particular account of this answer, that the Reader may judge thereby, whether
those persons who are so well furnish'd with Complements of this Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on as Barbarians: and no doubt but he will be much more surpriz'd, when I shall tell him,
that there is more civility to be found among the <hi>Indians,</hi> then there is among those who
pretend to the sole possession of it, but seldom accompany it with the sincerity which ever
attends it in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where such as are friends, are such without any shiness or reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to those to whom they have promised friendship, as they are, on the other side, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
enemies to such as have injur'd them.</p>
                  <p>I intreated <hi>Myrsabeg</hi> to sit down, and caus'd to be presented to him a Box of <hi>Bettelé</hi>

Plant, whose leaves are like those of the Orange-tree, save that they are not quite so broad,

the Plant is very weak, whence it comes that it is supported by a stake, or set near some
other tree, to which it clings and spreads about the branches, as Ivy does<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <note place="margin">Areca.</note> This Plant is very delicate, and must be
cultivated with much care and tenderness, especially as to the watering of it; for it must
not have either too much heat, or too much moisture, in as much as it is observed, that it
grows not in hot places, such as <hi>Mozambique</hi> and <hi>Zoffala,</hi> nor yet in cold Countries; as for
instance, in the more Northerly Provinces of <hi>China.</hi> It does not bring forth any fruit in

mean condition, but spends two or three dozen of leaves a day. But in regard this Drug
is of it self very bitter, they put into every leaf an <hi>Areca</hi>-nut, the predominant qualities
whereof are cold and dry. This is that which <hi>Avicenna</hi> calls <hi>Faufel,</hi> and the Tree that
bears it is not much less then that of the <hi>Cocos,</hi> which is commonly called the <hi>Indian</hi> Palm-tree.

but also as to the veins, which are to be seen when it is cut. They mingle with it some of

Boxes of Lacque or Silver, and take of it as they go along the Streets, nay many times
when they are about business of consequence, and that in any place. They are also of a
belief, that this Drug fortifies the natural heat, and accordingly account it one of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies;
upon which account it is, that they abstain from it when they are in affliction, and
particularly when the <hi>Moguls</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> celebrate their Fasts.</p>

to call on the Kings Lieutenant at his own house, as I pass'd by, in regard I was to go by
his door: but I met him in the Street in his Coach, there being carried before him three
Banners of Taffata, Red and Green, charg'd with flames of Silver; as soon as he perceived
me, he turn'd his Coach, and oblig'd me to go along with him to his House. His House
was seated in the most delightful quarter of the City, having two Gates to enter in at, one
whereof led into a spacious Court, the other into a fair Garden, about the Walls where of
there was one continued structure. He treated me with <hi>Bettelé</hi> and Palm-wine; but
having time little enough to perform the journey I intended that day, I staid not with him
above half an hour. He sent one of his Menial servants after me to give order to the

                     <note place="margin">Comes to <hi>Serguntra.</hi>
                     </note> but it was so late, that the <hi>Benjans,</hi> who burn no
Candles for fear that Flies and such other Insects might be destroyed thereby, would not
open their Shops to sell me any forrage for my Beasts. It is much different from what is
commonly used in <hi>Europe;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What they keep tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Beasts with.</note> For the Country bringing forth no Oats, and very little Grass,
they accustom their Beasts to another kind of sustenance, and keep them with a certain
Paste, which they make up of Sugar and Meal, into which they sometimes put a little But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
We were going to break open one of their Shops, but ere we had done any harm, one
of the <hi>Benjans</hi> brought us some forrage.</p>
                  <p>The next day before noon, we travell'd five Leagues to a great Village, where we baited
our Beasts, giving to each of the Oxen a pound and a half, and to the Horses two pounds
of Sugar,<note place="margin">Tzietbagh <hi>Garden.</hi>
                     </note> mixt with Meal. Thence we got to the Garden of <hi>Tzietbagh,</hi> where we bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again.</p>
                  <p>This Garden, which, no doubt, is the most delightful of any in the <hi>Indies,</hi> is also the most
considerable of any in the whole Country, not only in regard of the Victory which the
<hi>Mogul</hi> gain'd in that place, over the last King of <hi>Guzuratta,</hi> as we have mentioned before,
and which gave it the name of <hi>Tzietbagh,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Garden of Victory;</hi> but also in
respect of its magnificent Structures, and the noble Fruits which grow there in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.
It is seated in one of the most pleasant places in the world, upon the
side of a great Pool, having on the side toward the water several Pavillions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on that
towards <hi>Amadabat,</hi> a very high Wall. The sumptuousness of the buildings speaks
the great Spirit of the Prince that founded it, as doth also the <hi>Caravansera</hi> adjoyning
thereto.</p>
                  <p>There are in the Garden many Allyes of Fruit-trees; as Orange and Citro-trees of
all sorts, Pomegranate-trees, Date-trees, Almond-trees, Mulberry-trees, the Trees which
bear <hi>Tamarinds, Mangas,</hi> and <hi>Cocos,</hi> besides many other not known to us; and there
was such abundan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of them, and they were planted so close, that we could walk about the
Garden in the sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, which was a great refreshing to us: The branches of all these Trees were
infinitely stor'd with Apes, which added not a little to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he divertisment and satisfaction
of our walk. We staid no longer in it then while our Horses were baiting, in regard we
were resolv'd to get that day to <hi>Amadabat,</hi> whither we came at night. I was that day on
horse-back, and by way of sport, would needs frighten the Apes, which plaid a thousand
tricks about us, in so much that we began to think them troublesome. I shot two of them
with my Pistol, whereat the rest were so incensed, that they seem'd to conspire together,
as if they had a design to set upon us. Their cries and distorted looks discover'd how much
they were inclin'd to do us some mischief, in so much that about twenty of the biggest of
them followed us for above half a League; but perceiving us ready to turn towards them,
they got among the Trees, and at last gave over their pursuit of us.</p>
                  <p>Coming to <hi>Amadabath,</hi> I met with a <hi>Caffila,</hi> or <hi>Caravan,</hi> of about 200. Merchants, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
and <hi>Benjans,</hi> which was going to <hi>Agra,</hi> the chief City of all the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s country. The
<hi>English</hi> President had ordered him,<note place="margin">Goes for <hi>Agra.</hi>
                     </note> who had the conduct of the <hi>Caravan,</hi> to take me along
with him, and the Director of the Commerce at <hi>Amadabath,</hi> added thereto his particular
recommendations; so that those Merchants received me into their company, and I went
along with them thence on the 28. of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The weather and the way were very fair, but I met with so few Villages, that the first
I have any account to give of, was that of <hi>Paingat;</hi> and the sixth day after our departure
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47786:214"/>
from <hi>Amadabath,</hi> we came to the City of <hi>Heribath,</hi> which is fifty Leagues distant from it.
This City is not very big,<note place="margin">Heribath.</note> and hath neither Gates nor Walls, as having been razed by <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murleng,</hi>
or <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> as had been also the Castle, whereof the ruines are yet to be seen
upon a high Mountain,<note place="margin">Damtiges.</note> not far from the City. Between this City and that of <hi>Damtiges,</hi>
which is distant from that of <hi>Heribath</hi> other fifty Leagues, we met a <hi>Caffila</hi> of <hi>Benjan</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who told us, they had been set upon by 200. High-way-men, of the <hi>Rasboutes,</hi> who
had forc'd them to ransom themselves at a hundred <hi>Ropias,</hi> and that we should do well to
stand upon our guard, inasmuch as the day before they had seen a hundred more of them,
who having understood from them what they had paid their Camrades, had siad no more to
them, and only took away one of their Oxen; but that they were gone to joyn with the
former, and that they would not fail to set upon us. We made our advantage of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
and caused our Waggons to be fastned together, and the Souldiers that guarded
them were so disposed, as that they might relieve one another, without the least fear of
any disorder. Near a certain Village we met with fifty of those rascally Companions, but
they thought us so well arm'd, and so resolv'd to stand upon our advantage to defend our
selves, that they passed by without saying ought to us, yet discovering withall by their
march, that they were come only to take a view of us. We understood afterwards, how
that returning by the same Village, they had said, that if we had been at a little further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from it, they would have disputed the way with us.</p>
                  <p>Fifty Leagues thence, we came near a Village called <hi>Syedck,</hi> which had in it a very
strong Castle. And whereas most of our Beasts were extreamly wearied, by reason of the
great dayes journeys we had made, we ordered that some of the Oxen and Waggons
should go before. But they were hardly got into a little bottom that was in the way, not
above six hundred paces from us, ere they were set upon by ten <hi>Rasboutes,</hi> who had lain
in ambush behind a little Hill and at the first onset wounded two <hi>Benjans,</hi> and were driving
away the Waggons, which they had before turn'd out of the Road, when we discovered
them aftar off, and sent to them some of our Souldiers, who forced the Robbers to forsake
what they had taken.<note place="margin">Comes to <hi>Agra.</hi>
                     </note> After this we met with no misfortune, and came safely to <hi>Agra,</hi>
where <hi>I</hi> took up my quarters among the <hi>English,</hi> whose Civilities to me here were conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

                  <p>The <hi>Mogul,</hi> or great King of <hi>Indosthan,</hi> does often change the place of his abode, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that there is no City in all his Kingdom, of any considerable account, where he hath
not his Palaces;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Agra</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> but he delights not so much in any as <hi>Agra,</hi> which, to do it right, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the noblest City in all his Dominions. It lies 28. degrees on this side the Line, in the
Province of <hi>Indosthan,</hi> upon the River <hi>Gemini,</hi> which falls into the <hi>Ganges,</hi> above the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Bengala.</hi> It is at least twice as big as <hi>Ispahan,</hi> and it is as much as a Man can do to
ride about it on horse-back in a day. It is fortified with a good Wall, of a kind of red
Free-stone, and a Ditch, which is above thirty fathom broad. Its Streets are fair and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and there are some of them vaulted, which are above a quarter of a League in length,
where the Merchants and Tradesmen have their Shops, distinguished by their Trades and
the Merchandises which are there sold; every Trade, and every Merchant having a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Street and Quarter assigned him.<note place="margin">It hath its Merket-places.</note> There are in it fifteen <hi>Meidans</hi> and <hi>Basars,</hi> whereof
the most spacious is that which is before the Castle, where may be seen sixty great Guns of
all sizes, but not kept in any order so as to be made use of. There is also in that place a
high Pole, as at the <hi>Meidan</hi> of <hi>Ispahan,</hi> where the Court Lords, and sometimes the <hi>Mogul</hi>
himself divert themselves with shooting at the Parrot fastned at the top of it. There are in
the City fourscore <hi>Caravanseras,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">80. Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanseras.</note> for the accommodation and convenience of Forreign Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
most of them three Stories high, with very noble Lodgings, Store-houses, Vaults and
Stables belonging to them, together with Galleries and private Passages for the correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and communication of the Chambers. Every one of them hath a certain person,
whose charge it is to lock them up, and to take care that the Merchandises be safely kept.
He does also supply the place of a Sutler, and sels all sorts of Provision, Forrage, and Wood,
to those that lodge in them.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the <hi>Mogul,</hi> and most of the greatest Lords about his Court, profess the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bumetan</hi>
Religion,<note place="margin">Mosquey.</note> there is also in <hi>Agra</hi> a very great number of <hi>Metschid,</hi> or <hi>Mosqueys,</hi> and
among the rest seventy great ones, of which the six principal they call <hi>Metschid-adine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that it is in them they do their Devotions of Holy-dayes.</p>
                  <p>In one of these last named, is to be seen the Sepulchre of one of their Saints, called <hi>Sean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and they say he is of the Posterity of <hi>Aaly.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of a Gyant.</note> In another of them may be seen the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
of another Saint, who being 30. foot in length, and 16. in breadth, must needs have
been one of the mightiest Gyants that ever were talk'd of. His Tomb was cover'd all over
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47786:215"/>
with little Flags, and we were told he had been one of their Heroes, who had sometime
done wonders in the wars. To this place there are great Pilgrimages made, insomuch
that the Devotions of the Pilgrims do, by the Offerings they make, very much augment
the wealth of that <hi>Mosquey,</hi> the Revenue whereof is very great without those advantages.
There are daily maintain'd in it a great number of poor people, so that it may be truly said,
that the Devotions done there are not inferiour to those done at the Sepulchre of <hi>Schich
Sefi</hi> at <hi>Ardebil.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sanctuaries</note> These <hi>Metzids,</hi> and the Courts which depend on them, serve also for so
many Sanctuaries to persons guilty of any capital Crimes, as also to such as fear imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their Debt. These are the <hi>Allacapi</hi> of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and are called by the <hi>Indians,
Allader,</hi> and the priviledges of them in the <hi>Indies,</hi> are equal to those the <hi>Allacapi</hi> are endued
with in <hi>Persia,</hi> insomuch that the <hi>Mogul</hi> himself, though his power be absolute, cannot
force a man out of these Sanctuaries, be his crime of ever so heynous a nature, by reason of
the Veneration which these people have for their Saints.</p>
                  <p>There are numbred in the City of <hi>Agra</hi> above eight hundred Baths,<note place="margin">800. Baths.</note> or Hot-houses, from
which there comes in yearly to the <hi>Mogul</hi> a very considerable sum of money, occasioned
hence, that this kind of Purification making one of the principal parts of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there passes not a day, but that these places are frequented by an infinite number of
persons.</p>
                  <p>The great Lords about the Court, who are called <hi>Rasgi,</hi> or <hi>Rajas,</hi> have their Houses and
Palaces in the City, besides their Country-houses, all magnificent, both as to structure and
houshold-stuffe. The King hath several Gardens and Houses without the City, whither he
often retires himself with his Women-dancers, who dance before him stark naked. But there
is not any thing gives a greater demonstration of the greatness of this Monarch, then his
Palace, which stands upon the River <hi>Gemini,</hi> and is near four Leagues about. It is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
well fortified,<note place="margin">The <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul's</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> according to the fortification of that Country, with a Wall of Free-stone,
and a great Ditch, having at every Gate a Draw-bridge, the Avenues whereof are
also very well fortified, especially at the North-gate. The Gate which leads to the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
is on the West-side, and is called <hi>Cistery.</hi> Under this Gate is the <hi>Diwan,</hi> or the place
of publick Judicature; and there is adjoyning to it a spacious Hall, where the principal
<hi>Visier</hi> dispatches and seals all Orders for the ordinary and extraordinary Levies of men,
whereof the Originals are kept at the said place. As soon as a man is come within this
Gate, he finds himself in a spacious Street, having Shops on both sides, which leads directly
to the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Palace, which is called <hi>Derbar.</hi> The Gate by which a man enters into it is
called <hi>Achobarke Derwage,</hi> that is to say, <hi>King Achobar's Gate,</hi> and there is such a respect
observed at it, as that, the Kings Sons only excepted, all other Lords, what quality soever
they are of, are obliged to alight from their Horses, and to go in a foot. It is in this quarter
that the Women are lodged, who divert the King and his Family with their singing and
dancing.<note place="margin">The <hi>Mogul</hi> worships the Sun.</note> The fourth Gate, which is called <hi>Dersame,</hi> leads to the River, and thither it is
that the <hi>Mogul</hi> comes every morning to worship the Sun at his rising. It is on that side
also, that the Grandees of the Kingdom, who are about the Court, come every day to do
their submissions to the King, going up to a little eminent place, whence the King may
take the more particular notice of them. The <hi>Hadys,</hi> or Commanders of Horse, do also
give their attendance there, but they stand at a greater distance, and make not their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
but upon the Kings express Order, who comes also to this place to see the fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Lyons, Elephants, Bulls and other wild Beasts, it being his ordinary divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
every day, Friday only excepted, which he spends in his Devotions. Besides all this,
there is yet another Gate, which leads into the Guard-Hall, which they call <hi>Attesanna,</hi>
where the Officers keep a Guard, and relieve one the other by weeks. There is a passage
through this Hall into a paved Court, at the further end whereof there is, under a Portal,
a row of silver Pillars, where there stands a particular Guard, which keeps the people from
getting within it, and permits only the Great Lords that belong to the Court to enter
there.</p>
                  <p>There it was I met with the <hi>Persian</hi> Servant who run away from me at <hi>Suratta,</hi> and
who proffered me to do me any service lay in his power, during my aboad at <hi>Agra;</hi> nay,
would have brought me within the Pillars before mentioned, but the Guards would not
permit it.<note place="margin">The <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul's</hi> Throne.</note> A man must go within these Pillars to get to the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Chamber, where may
be seen, within another row of lesser Pillars, all of Gold, the Throne of that great Prince,
made of massie Gold, and enrich'd with Diamonds, Pearls, and other precious Stones.
Above the Throne there is a Gallery, where the King shews himself every day, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
their Complaints who have any violence or injury done them. Those who have any
Complaints to make, ring one of the little Bells which are hung up above those Pillars;
but unless a man have excellent good Evidence to prove what he alledges, it will be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47786:215"/>
to offer at it, for he will hazard his own life. The Kings Sons only, who give
him Air with a kind of Fan, and keep off the Flies, and the Grand <hi>Visier,</hi> are permitted to
come within those Pillars;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio.</note> and there is no person to go into any of the inner Lodgings,
but the <hi>Godia,</hi> or Eunuchs, who wait on the Ladies of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and are in number about
a thousand or twelve hundred.</p>
                  <p>There is also within this Castle another Appartment, which is known by a great Tower,
the covering whereof is of Gold, which shews what excessive wealth is enclosed within it,
in eight spacious Vaults, which are full of Gold, Silver and precious Stones whereof the
value is in a manner inestimable.</p>

                  <p>But this came not any thing near the Treasure which <hi>Scach Choram</hi> was possessed of, at
the time of my Travels in those Parts. This Wealth is more and more augmented every
day, not so much out of the ordinary Revenue coming in from the great Kingdoms he
hath, (in regard that as his ordinary Expence abates not any thing of his Treasure; so
is it seldom seen that he increases it, by ought remaining at the years end of his Revenue)
as by the Presents which are made him, and the Escheats falling to him at the death of
great Lords and Favourites, who make the <hi>Mogul</hi> Heir to what they had gotten by his
Favour, insomuch that the Children have no hope to enjoy ought of their Fathers Estates,
either Real or Personal. For the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Authority is such, and his Power so Absolute,
that the Estates of all his Subjects are at his disposal; and thence it comes, that only his
will decides all differences arising among them, they having no other Law, then implicitely
to submit to what he ordians. He hath the absolute disposal of their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and thence it is, that upon his meer Order and Command, the greatest Lords
are dragg'd to Execution, and their Estates, Charges, and Governments taken away from
them.</p>
                  <p>There is no hereditary Dignity in all his Country.<note place="margin">No heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary charge or dignity in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul's</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> That of <hi>Rasgi,</hi> or <hi>Raja,</hi> which he
bestows rather upon the account of Merit then Birth, is Personal, as that of <hi>Chan</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi>
and is not deriv'd to Posterity, but by the recommendation of Vertue. Not that it is to
be inferred hence, that the <hi>Mogul</hi> does exclude from Charges the Children of such as have
done him good service; but he gives them lesser charges, by which they may advance
themselves to the chiefest in the Kingdom, if either an extraordinary Vertue, or the Princes
Favour call them thereto.</p>
                  <p>The chiefest Offices of the Kingdom are those of principal <hi>Visir,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The chief Officers.</note> which is somewhat
like that of Chancellourship elsewhere; Chief of the Eunuchs, who is as it were Lord
High Steward; the Treasurer, the principal Secretary of State; the General of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
and the Overseer of the Houshold-stuffe, Tents and precious Stones. These are
of the Princes Privy Council, whereto is sometimes also called the <hi>Couteval,</hi> who is as it
were the chief Judge, and commands the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Guard. The Council sits in the night,
from seven of the clock till nine, in a Hall, which they call <hi>Gasalean.</hi> No day almost
passes, but the <hi>Mogul</hi> is to be seen, in the morning, at Sun-rising, at which time the Lords
of the Court salute him with their <hi>Patschach Salammet;</hi> as also about Noon, when he
comes to see the Beasts fight, and in the Evening, when he comes to a certain Window
to behold the Sun-setting; with whom he retires himself with the noise of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Drums and Timbrels, and the Acclamations of the people, who wish him a long
and happy life.</p>

Arrows, the Javeline, of a kind of long-headed-Pike, which they dart with great exactness,
the Cymitar on one side, and the Ponyard on the other: and the defensive is the Buckler,
which they have alwayes hanging about their necks.</p>
                  <p>They have no Fire-Arms with Wheels, nor yet Fire-locks, but their Infantry are expert
enough at the Musket. Those among the Foot, who have no Muskets, have besides their
Bows and Arrows, a Pike ten or twelve foot long, with which they begin the fight, by
darting it at the Enemy; instead of using it in opposition to the Horse, as is done in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
Some among them have Coats of Mail about them, which come down to their knees:
but there are very few make use of Head-pieces, in regard they would be very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
by reason of the excessive heats in those parts.<note place="margin">Observe no order in fighting.</note> They know nothing of the distinction
of Van-guard, main Battle, and Rear-guard, and understand neither Front nor File, nor
make any Battalion, but fight confusedly without any Order.</p>
                  <p>Their greatest strength consists in the Elephants, which carry on their backs certain
Towers of Wood, wherein there are three or four Harquebuses hanging by hooks, and as
many Men to order that Artillery. The Elephants serve them for a Trench, to oppose the
first attempt of the Enemy, but it often comes to pass, that the Artificial Fires, which are
made use of to frighten these Creatures, put them into such a disorder, that they do much
more mischief among those who brought them to the Field, then they do among the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
They have abundance of Artillery,<note place="margin">Their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery.</note> and some considerable great Pieces, and such
as whereof it may be said, the invention of them is as ancient as that of ours. They also
make Gun-powder, but it is not fully so good as what is made in <hi>Europe.</hi> Their Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels
and Trumpets are of Copper, and the noise they make, in order to some Military
Action, is not undelightful. Their Armies do not march above five <hi>Cos,</hi> or Leagues,
according to the measure of the Country, in a day; and when they encamp, they
take up so great a quantity of ground, that they exceed the compass of our greatest
Cities.</p>
                  <p>In this they observe an admirable Order,<note place="margin">The order of their Armies.</note> inasmuch as there is no Officer nor Souldier,
but knows where he is to take up his Quarters; nor can there be any City more regularly
divided into Streets, Markets and other publick places, for the greater communication and
convenience of the Quarters, and for the distribution of Provisions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mogul,</hi> and the General of the Army, have their Tents pitched at a certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from those of the rest, nay, as far as a Musket will carry, from those of their own
Guards.</p>

Merit. The <hi>Mogul</hi> bestows it also on the Chancellour, or principal <hi>Visir,</hi> who is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
of his Privy Councel, and as it were Vice-Roy of all his Dominions, inasmuch as
he it is who sends Orders into all the Provinces of the Kingdom; and it is to him that all
are to make their Addresses in all Affairs of importance. The King permits him not to
receive any Presents; yet does he not forbear taking them underhand, and his Secretaries
and other Officers under him take them so openly, that there is no, ever so secret, transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but a man may have the particulars thereof, if he hath money to bestow among those
who have the transcription and dispatch of them. These <hi>Rasgi</hi> have so great a Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for their King, that it were impossible for a man to approach things most sacred with
more submission, then they express when they speak to him. The discourses they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him with are intermingled and interrupted with continual Reverences; and when
they take their leave of him, they bow down their heads, put their hands over their eyes,
thence afterwards upon their breasts, and at last touch the ground therewith, to shew they
are but dust and athes in comparison of him, wishing him all prosperity, and coming out of
his presence backwards.</p>

Clothes of Scarlet, Velvet, or Brocadoe. Every Elephant carries two Men, one whereof
governs and guides the Creature, by touching his forehead with an Iron-hook, the other
carries a large Banner of Silk, embroidered with Gold and Silver; excepting only the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight foremost, which carry each of them one that playes on the Timbrel. The
King himself is mounted on an excellent <hi>Persian</hi> Horse, or goes in a Coach, drawn by two
white Oxen, the Horns whereof, which are very large, are adorn'd with Gold; or some
times he is carried by several men in a <hi>Palanquin,</hi> or kind of Sedan. The <hi>Rasgi</hi> and the
Officers of the Court march after him, and have coming behind them five or six hundred
Elephants,<note place="margin">He changes the place of his abode according to the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> Camels or Waggons loaded with baggage. For the most part he takes up his
Quarters in the Fields, where he causes his Tents to be pitched; which is done upon this
account, that as on the one side there are but few Cities, where he might find necessary
accommodations for the quarters and entertainment of the Court, so on the other, he takes
a particular pleasure in encamping, in the Summer time, in cool places; in the Winter, in
hot places; insomuch that he is in some sort the Master of the Seasons, as well as of all the
other things which are subject to him. He commonly leaves <hi>Agra</hi> towards the end of
<hi>April,</hi> and retires near <hi>Labor,</hi> or some other more Northerly Province, where he passes over
the moneths of <hi>May, Iune, Iuly</hi> and <hi>August;</hi> and then he returns again to the place of his
ordinary residence.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Agra</hi> is of such extent and so populous,<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Agra</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> that were there a necessity, there

                  <p>There are above forty small Cities, and above three thousand five hundred Villages that

The Country is delightful and very fertile, producing abundance of Indico, Cotton, Salt-Peter
and other things, wherewith the Inhabitants drive a vast Trade. There are two Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals
which are celebrated in this place, with extraordinary Ceremonies; one whereof is
that of the first day of the year, which, with the <hi>Persians,</hi> they call <hi>Naurus, Nauros,</hi> or

this Theatre there is erected another building of painted wood, and embellish'd with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Pearl, into which go some of the principal Lords about the Court, who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
have their Tents pitch'd in the first Court of the Palace, filled with all they have that
is rich and magnificent, whereof they make the greatest Ostentation they can that day:
The Predecessors of this Prince, who now reigns, were wont to go into all these Tents, and
to take thence any thing they liked; but now the Ceremony is otherwise. For the King
accompanied by the seven Ministers of State, go up into the Theatre, where he sits upon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47786:218"/>
Velvet Cushions, enbroidered with Gold and Pearls, and stayes for the Presents which are
to be made to him. The Queen is in a certain Gallery, whence she sees all the Ceremony,
yet is not seen her self. Departing thence, he sits upon his Ordinary Throne, where he
receives the Presents of the people, which he continues to do for eighteen dayes together.
Towards the end of the Festival, the King in his turn makes his Presents to the Lords,
which consists in Charges, Employments, and new Honours, which he distributes among
those that have given him most.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mogul</hi>'s birth-day is celebrated with the Ceremonies following.<note place="margin">The Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the <hi>Mogul's</hi> birth-day.</note> He begins the
day with all manner of divertisements; which over, he goes to the Palace of the Queen
his Mother, if she be living, and causes many Presents to be made her by the Grandees of
his Kingdom. After dinner he puts on the richest clothes he hath, and covers himself all
over with Gold and precious Stones, and being thus rather loaden then adorn'd with inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
wealth, he goes into a Tent, where he is expected by the Lords of the Court, in
which finding a pair of Scales, he weighs himself. These Scales are of massy Gold, as are
also the Chains by which they hang, and are all beset with precious Stones. He puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into one of the Scales, and into the other there are put several bags of Silver, one bag
of Gold, some precious Stones, some pieces of Silk-stuffs, Linnen cloath, Pepper, Cloves,
Nutmeg and Cinnamon, Wheat, Pulse and Herbs, and there is an exact account kept of
the difference of weight there may be between one year and another. The King gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with his own hands, all the money among the poor, and the rest are bestowed on the
<hi>Benjans.</hi> That done, the King seats himself in his Throne, and causes to be cast among
the Grandees, Nuts, Pistachoes, Almonds, and several other Fruits of Gold, but so finely
wrought, that a thousand of them weighed not thirty Crowns. This some would boggle
much to admit for a Truth; yet certain it is that it hath been seen, that the value of ten
Crowns bestowed in these trifles, filled a great Basin of them; so that all the liberality of
this powerful Monarch could not amount to a hundred Crowns. The Festival is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with a great Feast, at which the <hi>Mogul</hi> entertains the Lords of his Court, with whom
he passes away the night in drinking.</p>
                  <p>They celebrate also another Festival,<note place="margin">Another <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Feast.</note> which they begin ten dayes after the new Moon of
the moneth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> much after the same manner as the <hi>Persians</hi> celebrate their <hi>Aschur.</hi>
The <hi>Indians</hi> observe this Festival in honour of two Brethren, named <hi>Ianze,</hi> and <hi>Iawze,</hi>
servants to <hi>Haly,</hi> who being gone in Pilgrimage to a particular place of Devotion, upon
the Coast of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> the <hi>Bramans,</hi> and other Pagans of those parts set upon them, and
forc'd them to retreat into a Castle, where they besieg'd them: These holy Persons main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the Siege a long time; but being resolv'd not to drink of the Water which the
Pagans had prophan'd by casting a Lizard into it, a Creature for which the <hi>Mahumetans</hi>
have an aversion, because of its uncleanness, they took a resolution to make a sally upon
the besiegers, and killed many of them, but at last they were overcome by the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their enemies, who left them dead upon the place. There are carried about the
City, Coffins covered with Bows and Arrows, Turbants, Cymitars, and Garments of Silk,
which the people accompany with sobbings and lamentations, in commemoration of the
death of those holy Persons. Some among them dance at the Ceremony, others strike
their Swords one against another; nay, there are those who cut and slash themselves, so
as that the bloud comes out in several places, wherewith they rub their clothes, and by
that means represent a very strange procession. Towards night they set up several Figures
of men, made of Straw, to personate the Murtherers of those Saints; and having shot a
great many Arrows at them, they set them on fire, and reduce them to ashes. And this they
do with so much fury and animosity, that should there be any of the Pagans in the Streets
at that time, they would run the hazard of their lives; whence it comes, that during these
Ceremonies, they stir not out of their houses.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of those parts celebrate also another Feast in the moneth of <hi>Iune,</hi> in
memory of the sacrifice of <hi>Abraham,</hi> at which they kill He-Goats, which they eat at the
Entertainments they make among themselves that day.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is,<note place="margin">The <hi>Mogul</hi> comes from <hi>Tamerlan.</hi>
                     </note> that the <hi>Mogul</hi> stands very much upon his descent, in a direct and masculine
I ne, from <hi>Temirlanque,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Temir, the lame,</hi> who is commonly called <hi>Tamerlan,</hi>
who was of the Family of <hi>Chinguis-Chan,</hi> King of <hi>Tartary. Scach Choram,</hi> who was
living at my being in those parts, was a younger Son of <hi>Scach Iahan's,</hi> and had usurped
the Crown from Prince <hi>Polagi,</hi> his Nephew, whom we found at <hi>Caswin</hi> at our coming into
<hi>Persia.</hi> He might be then about sixty years of Age, and had three Sons, whereof the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was about 25. years of age; but he had not the affection he should have had for him,
since it was his intention to have the youngest declar'd Heir of the Crown of <hi>Indosthan,</hi>
and to leave the two elder Brethren the command of certain Provinces. The initials of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47786:218"/>
his Government had been cruel and bloudy,<note place="margin">The initials of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment cruel.</note> but he was very much reclaim'd from those
courses, though he yet ever and anon betrayed his inclinations to severity, in the torments
he put those persons to who were guilty of High Treason, whom he caused to be flead
alive, or torn in pieces by wild Beasts. In other things he was of an humour good enough,
being a great lover of Entertainments, Musick and Dancing, especially that of common
Prostitutes, who often danced stark naked in his presence, and diverted him by all manner
of extravagant postures.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>English</hi> told me a Story, which I think so pleasant, that I shall not think it much to
digress so far as to insert it here.<note place="margin">A pleasant story of the <hi>Mogul.</hi>
                     </note> This King had a particular affection for a certain <hi>Rasgi,</hi>
who upon the account of his courage, and the pleasantness of his coversation, was grown
so considerable about the Court, that there hardly passed a day, but the King sent for him.
One day the King asking some that were about him, why that Lord was not come to the
Court; and answer being made him, that he had taken Physick, he sent to him a company
of those Women-dancers, and commanded them to strip themselves stark naked, and to
ease their Natures before him. The <hi>Rasgi</hi> having notice brought him of their arrival,
ordered them to be conducted to his Chamber, imagining the <hi>Mogul</hi> had sent them pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to give him some divertisement; but understanding what they were ordered to do,
and perceiving thereby that the King was in a good humour, and desirous to make himself
sport, he resolved to put a trick upon him, and so to laugh at those who would have laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at him.</p>
                  <p>Having ask'd the Women-dancers what commands the King had laid upon them, and
heard their answer, he afterwards asked them whether they were ordered to do any thing
else, and being inform'd they had order to do nothing but what they had told him before,
he bid them put the Kings Command in execution with all the exactness they could, but
that they should have a special care not to exceed it by doing any thing more, telling
them, that if they piss'd the least drop while they did their other business, he would have
them whipp'd till the bloud came. Not one of them would expose her self to that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
so that they thereupon returned to the Court, where they gave the King an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how they had been entertain'd by the <hi>Rasgi.</hi> The <hi>Mogul</hi> was so taken with the
pleasant trick which the <hi>Rasgi</hi> had put upon him, that it put him into the best humour in
the world.</p>
                  <p>His ordinary divertisement every day was to see the combats of Lyons, Bulls, Elephants,
Tigers,<note place="margin">The <hi>Mogul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Leopards, and other wild Beasts, an argument of his cruel Nature, and bloudy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
which his perpetual seeing of this kind of combats did much heighten. He also
took a delight in seeing Men ingag'd with Beasts, but this was not but with their own
consent; and such as would venture their lives, out of a hope to gain that reputation of
Courage as should prove the raising of their Fortunes, were to make use of no Arms but
Sword and Buckler. This puts me in mind of a Combat which <hi>Scach Choram</hi> ordered to
be had, at the conclusion of a great Entertainment which he had made on the Birth-day
of his Son, who was King of <hi>Bengala,</hi> in a <hi>Caravansera</hi> without the City, at which place
were kept to this purpose all sorts of wild Beasts. This <hi>Caravansera</hi> had adjoyning to it a
spacious Garden encompassed with a wall, upon which the people were come to see that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement.
The first engagement was that of a wild Bull and a Lyon; and the next,
that of a Lyon and a Tiger.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the Tiger perceiv'd the Lyon,<note place="margin">A combat between a Lyon and a Tiger.</note> he went straight towards him, and closing
with him with all his strength, got him down. 'Twas generally believed, it would be no
hard matter for the Tiger to make an end of the Lyon; but the Lyon immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
himself, and took the Tiger so fast by the throat that he was thought dead: yet he
made a shift to disingage himself, and the combat was renewed with greater fury then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
till at last weariness made both give over. They were both very much hurt, but the
wounds were not mortal on either side. Upon this, <hi>Allaemerdi-Chan,</hi> Governour of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semar,</hi>
who stood near the King, came forth and said, that <hi>Schach Choram</hi> was desirous to
see, whether there were among his Subjects, any one that had so much courage, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
with any of those Beasts, and that only with a Sword and Buckler, and that he who
durst attempt it should appear, that the <hi>Mogul,</hi> having been an ocular witness of his worth,
might accordingly requite it, and honour him, not only with his favour, but also with the
quality of <hi>Chan.</hi> Upon which Proposition, three <hi>Indosthans</hi> proffering to undertake the
engagement, <hi>Allaemerdy-Chan</hi> told them further, that the Kings meaning was, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
should undertake the Combat, should do it only with Sword and Buckler; and that
it was his pleasure, that those who had any Coats of Mail about them, should put them off,
that the Combat might be without any advantage.</p>
                  <p>Upon these terms a furious Lyon was let forth, who perceiving his Adversary coming
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47786:219"/>
into the place, made immediately towards him. The <hi>Indosthan</hi> made his party good very
stoutly, till at last, no longer able to bear the weight of the Beast, which lay very heavy
upon him on the left hand, he began to let fall his Buckler, which the Lyon endeavour'd all
he could to force from him, while with his left paw, he would have fastned on his enemies
right arm, and so have seiz'd him by the throat, when the Man, putting his hand to his
Girdle, pull'd out a Dagger, and thrust it so far into the Lyons jaws, that he was forced to
let go his hold, and get away. The Man followed him, and giving him a blow over the
mouth laid him all along, and afterwards kill'd him. The people made acclamations for his
happy victory over the Lyon; but as soon as the noise was over, the <hi>Mogul</hi> call'd the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosthan</hi>
to him, and with an angry smile said to him, <hi>It must needs be confess'd thou art a
valiant man, and that thou hast fought very gallantly. But had I not forbidden thee to engage
against this Beast with any advantage? And had I not appointed what Arms thou shouldst
make use of? And yet thou hast done contrary to my Order, and hast not overcome my Lyon as a
Person of Honour, but hast surpriz'd him with forbidden Arms, and so hast killed him as a
murtherer, and not as a declar'd enemy.</hi> Whereupon he commanded two men to go down
into the Garden, and to rip up his belly; which was immediately put in execution, and
the Corps was set upon an Elephant to be carried through the City, to serve for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to others.</p>
                  <p>He who,<note place="margin">A Combat between a Man and a Tiger.</note> upon this Tragedy, came next into play, went with an undaunted courage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Tiger, which he was to engage with, in so much that his deportment was such as
raised in the minds of the Spectators a certain confidence of his obtaining the Victory.
But the Tigre, who it seems was too cunning for his Adversary, fastened on his throat, killed
him, and tore his body in pieces.</p>
                  <p>The third Champion that came upon the Stage,<note place="margin">A third Combat.</note> instead of being any way frightned at
the misfortune of his two Camrades, came very chearfully and couragiously into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and went straight towards the Tiger, who flesh'd with the precedent success, run at
his Adversary, with a design to make quick work with him; but the <hi>Indosthan,</hi> though a man
of low stature, and a wretched countenance, struck off at one blow the two fore-paws of
the Beast, and having by that means got him down, he soon dispatch'd him.</p>
                  <p>The King immediately ask'd him his name;<note place="margin">Courage rewarded.</note> whereto he made answer that it was <hi>Geily;</hi>
whereupon there came in a Gentleman, who presenting him from the <hi>Mogul</hi> with a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Brocadoe, said to him, Geily, <hi>receive this Garment from my hands, as an assurance
of the Kings favour, who sends it thee as a pledge thereof. Geily,</hi> having made several low
reverences, putting the Garment to his eyes and breast, and afterwards holding it in the Air,
and having made a short Prayer to himself, he at last pronounc'd aloud to this effect; <hi>My
Prayers to God are, that the</hi> Mogul<hi>'s glory may be equal to that of</hi> Tamerlan, <hi>from whom he
is descended; may his Arms prosper; may his Wealth be increased; may he live seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, and may his House be established for ever.</hi> Upon this there came to him two
Eunuchs, who conducted him to the Kings Chamber, at the entrance whereof, two <hi>Chans</hi>
took him between them, and so brought him to the Kings feet. After he had kiss'd them,
and was rising up, the <hi>Mogul</hi> said to him; <hi>It must be confessed,</hi> Geily-Chan, <hi>that thou hast
done a very great and glorious Action. I bestow on thee that name and quality which thou
shalt enjoy for ever. I will be thy Friend, and thou shalt be my servant.</hi> Thus was the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a single Action the Foundation of a mans Fortune, who was not so much as known
before, but grew famous afterwards, by the Charges he had in the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Armies.</p>
                  <p>It was my design to make a little longer stay at <hi>Agra;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mandelslo</hi> discovered to have kill'd on <hi>Indosthan</hi> at <hi>Ispahan.</hi>
                     </note> but there happened an accident
which oblig'd me to change my Resolution, nay, forc'd me to leave a place where I thought
my life in danger. For being one day fallen into discourse with the <hi>Persian</hi> servant, who
ran away from me at <hi>Surat,</hi> I perceiv'd coming towards me an <hi>Indosthan,</hi> a person of a
goodly presence, and as far as I could judge, of quality, who immediately asked me whence
I came, and what business I had in those parts. I made him answer, that I was an <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paean,</hi>
that I came from <hi>Germany,</hi> and that the desire I had to see the Court of the most
powerful Monarch in all the East, had brought me thither. He told me, that if he were
not much mistaken, he had seen me at <hi>Ispaban,</hi> and that questionless I was the person that
had kill'd a Kinsman of his at the Engagement which had happened between the <hi>Indians</hi>
and the <hi>Germans.</hi> This discourse had almost put me out of countenance; but upon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
recollection I told him, that I had never been in <hi>Persia,</hi> and that I came from <hi>England</hi>
by Sea to <hi>Surat,</hi> which the two <hi>English</hi> Merchants, who were then in my company, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be true. But he who did me the greatest kindness in this extremity, was my old
<hi>Persian</hi> servant, who swore by his <hi>Mahomed,</hi> and by his <hi>Hossein,</hi> that what I had told him
was nothing but the truth. Whereupon the <hi>Indosthan</hi> went away, but discover'd by his
deportment, that he gave not over-much credit to what we had said: and for my part,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47786:219"/>
I conceiv'd it but prudence to be distrustful of a man who had expressed his good will, had
there been occasion, to do me a mischief, and would no doubt have revenged his Kinsmans
death, of which my conscience told me I was guilty.</p>
                  <p>Upon these reflections I left <hi>Agra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leaver</hi> Agra.</note> with a <hi>Caffila,</hi> or <hi>Caravan,</hi> that was going to the City
of <hi>Lahor,</hi> which lies sixty Leagues further into the Country. I had the company of two
<hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants, and our travelling was so much the more pleasant, in that our way was
but one continued Alley, drawn in a streight line, and planted on both sides with Date-trees,
Palm-trees, <hi>Cocos</hi>-trees, and other kind of Fruit-trees, which gave us a continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
shade against the heat of the Sun. The sumptuous Houses which were to be seen
up and down the Country, the Apes, Peacocks, Parrats and other Birds found us very much
sport. One day with a Pistol-shot I kill'd a great Serpent, which I met with in the way,
and afterwards a Leopard and a Roe-buck: but the <hi>Benjans,</hi> of whom there were many
in our company, took it very ill at my hands, and reproach'd me with my cruelty, in that
I deprived those Creatures of a life which it was not in my power to give them, and which
God had not bestow'd on them, but that he might be thereby glorified: in so much that
when ever I handled my Pistol, they either express'd their trouble to see me take a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in violating, in their presence, the Laws of their Religion; or they intreated me, for
their sakes, not to kill them, and when I had made them understand, that I would in any
thing comply with their desires, they, on the other side, had all the kindness imaginable
for me.</p>
                  <p>The Country about <hi>Lahor</hi> is very fertile,<note place="margin">Lahor <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</hi>
                     </note> and brings forth all sorts of Fruits, as also
Wheat and Rice in abundance, much beyond any other Province of that great Kingdom.
The City is scituated at 32. degrees, 30. minutes elevation, upon the little River <hi>Ravy,</hi> or
<hi>Ravée,</hi> which, with four other Rivers, falls into the <hi>Indus,</hi> which upon that occasion is called
<hi>Pangab,</hi> or five-waters, as we have said elsewhere. It is very delightfully seated, especially
towards the River, on which side it hath many fair Gardens. The Kings Palace is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the City, from which it is divided by a high Wall, and hath many spacious Appartments.
There are also many other Palaces and great Houses, for the reception of those Lords who
ordinarily follow the Court. And in regard most of the Inhabitants are <hi>Mahumetans,</hi>
there is in this City also a great number of <hi>Metzids,</hi> or <hi>Mosqueys,</hi> and bathing places, for
their ordinary Purifications.<note place="margin">The Baths of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans.</hi>
                     </note> I had the curiosity to go into one of their Baths, to observe
their way of bathing. I took along with me my Interpreter, who was by Profession a
Broker, and went into one of their Baths, which was built according to the <hi>Persian</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
with a flat Roof, and had several Partitions, which were made all half round, very
narrow at the entrance, and broad at the bottom, having each of them a door by it self, and
two Receptacles or <hi>Tankes</hi> of Free-stone, into which the Water was let in by brazen
Cocks, to such height as those who came to bathe themselves desired it. After bathing,
I was ordered to sit down a while, and then I was laid down upon a Stone seven or eight
foot in length, and four in breadth, in which posture the Master of the Bath rubb'd me all
over with a Hair-cloth. He would also have rubb'd the soles of my feet with a handful
of Sand; but perceiving I was not able to endure it, he ask'd me whether I were a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
and having understood that I was, he gave me the Hair-cloath, that I might rub my
feet my self, though he had made no difficulty to rub all the rest of my body. This done,
there came into the Bath a little short Fellow, who laid me all along on the belly upon the
same stone, and rubb'd my back with his hands from the back-bone down to the sides,
telling me, that bathing would do me but little good, if I suffered not the bloud, which
might haply lye corrupted in that place, to be by that rubbing dispersed through all the
other members.</p>
                  <p>I found not any thing remarkable about <hi>Lahor,</hi> but one of the Kings Gardens, which
lies two dayes journey distant from it. I had, as a further diversion in this short piece of
my Travels, this, that in two dayes I rode on four several Creatures: For at first I had a
Mule; then a Camel, then an Elephant, and at last an Oxe, whose troting was the hardest
of any beast that ever I bestrid, lifting up his hoofs as high as the stirrop, and carrying me
between six and seven Leagues in less then four hours. I should have made some longer
stay at <hi>Lahor,</hi> but receiving Letters from <hi>Agra,</hi> I was forc'd to come away upon this account,
that the <hi>English</hi> President intended very suddenly to embark in order to his return for
<hi>England,</hi> whereupon I put my self into the company of certain <hi>Indian</hi> Merchants, who
were then upon their return to <hi>Amadabath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At my coming to <hi>Amadabath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Returns to <hi>Amada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi>
                     </note> the Director of the <hi>English</hi> Commerce told me, that he
had received Orders from the President to make as strong a <hi>Caffila</hi> as he could possibly, and
to come with all expedition to <hi>Surat.</hi> I there met also with Letters from the President,
whereby I understood, that he only expected the <hi>Caffila's</hi> of <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Amadabath,</hi> and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47786:220"/>
that he would depart as soon as they were come. He writ to me further, that being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a few dayes after to resign his Presidentship to another, whom his Superiour had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to receive it; and there being to be a great entertainment and feasting at that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
he should be glad I were present thereat.</p>
                  <p>During my stay at <hi>Amadabath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fire works.</note> the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> celebrated a Feast, which was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at night with very noble Fire-works. The Windows of all the Houses that stand in
the <hi>Meidan</hi> were beset with Lamps, before which were placed Vessels of Glass, fill'd with
Waters of several colours, which made a very delightful prospect. Upon the same <hi>Mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
before the Kings Palace, there are two low Houses, of which there is little use made
but at this Feast, it being the place whither the <hi>Sulthan</hi> and the Lords of the Court retire
themselves, while fire is set to the Works, which consisted of Squibs, Crackers, and other
ingenious inventions. Some had fasten'd Lamps to certain Wheels, which hung on, though
the Wheels turn'd about perpetually with great violence.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the <hi>Caffila</hi> of <hi>Agra</hi> was come to <hi>Amadabath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Returns to <hi>Surat.</hi>
                     </note> I took leave of my friends, and
went along with a <hi>Caravan</hi> of a hundred Waggons.</p>
                  <p>The first day we travell'd twelve <hi>Cos,</hi> or six Leagues, to the City of <hi>Mamadabath.</hi> The
next day, I went before with the Director of the Commerce at <hi>Amadabath,</hi> who, with his
Second, was desirous to be present at the Resignation which the President was to make of
his place. We were four in company, and we took along with us four Waggons, two
Horses, and twenty foot Souldiers for our Guard, leaving Order that the <hi>Caffila</hi> should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us with all expedition.</p>
                  <p>The foot Souldiers,<note place="margin">Persons of quality have Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners carried before them.</note> who carried our Arms and Banners, made a shift nevertheless to
keep pace with us. What I say concerning the Banners, relates to the custom of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
where there are no persons of any quality but have a Banner, or a kind of Colours,
such as Cornets use, carried before them. That day we cross'd the River <hi>Wasser,</hi> and took
up our Quarters at night in the Fort of <hi>Saselpour.</hi> There we met with the Factor of
<hi>Brodra,</hi> whose name was Mr. <hi>Pansfield,</hi> who treated us very magnificently the next day at
the place of his residence. We went thence in the evening, and lodg'd the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a great Garden, and the next day we prosecuted our journey. In the evening we
encamped hard by a <hi>Tanque,</hi> called <hi>Sambord;</hi> and in regard we had not met with any fair
Water all that day, we endeavour'd to get some out of the <hi>Tanque.</hi> But the Country people
fearing we might consume all the Water, there coming in at the same time a <hi>Dutch Caffila</hi>
of two hundred Waggons,<note place="margin">An Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Country people.</note> would not suffer us to come near it. Whereupon we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
out fifteen of our foot Souldiers, with express order to bring some Water, if not
by fair means, by force. But coming to the <hi>Tanque,</hi> they found it guarded by thirty armed
Men, and such as were resolv'd to maintain it, and to hinder any from taking of the Water.
However our Men went very resolutely towards them with their Swords drawn, upon
which, without any dispute at all, the Country people ran away; but while ours were
drawing Water, the <hi>Indians</hi> shot a certain number of Arrows, and discharg'd three Muskets
among them, and wounded five persons. Ours exasperated at that, kill'd three of the
Country people, whom we saw afterwards carried to the Village.</p>
                  <p>While we were at Supper, there came in to us one of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants, who told us,
that there had been seen two hundred <hi>Rasboutes</hi> upon our way,<note place="margin">An Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the <hi>Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boutes.</hi>
                     </note> who had committed seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
robberies for some dayes before, and that the very day before they had kill'd six men
within a League of the Village, near which we were then lodg'd. The <hi>Dutch Caffila</hi>
went away about midnight, and we follow'd it immediately after. But we had not gone
far beyond it, ere we discover'd one of those <hi>Holacueurs,</hi> who are wont to march in the
head of the <hi>Caffilas,</hi> and before Troops of Horse, and serve instead of Trumpeters, by
sounding a certain Instrument of Brass, much longer then our ordinary Trumpets. As
soon as he perceiv'd us, he slipp'd into the Wood, where he fell a sounding as loud as ever
he could, which we took for an assured Alarm that it would not be long ere they set upon
us. Accordingly, almost ere we could resolve how to make our party good against them,
we saw coming out of all sides of the Wood, a great number of <hi>Rasboutes,</hi> arm'd with
short Pikes, Bucklers, Bows and Arrows, but without any Fire-arms. We had the time
to charge those we had, which were four Fire-locks and three pair of Pistols. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
and I got on horseback, and bestow'd the Fire-locks among those who were in the
Coach, with express order not to fire till they were sure to do execution. Our Fire-arms
were charged with square pieces of Steel, and the <hi>Rasboutes</hi> came on in so close a body,
that at the first firing we saw three fall. They shot certain Arrows at us, wherewith
they hurt an Oxe and two foot Souldiers. One was shot into the Pommel of my Saddle,
and the <hi>English</hi> Merchant had another shot into his Turbant. The <hi>Dutch Caffila</hi> hearing
the noise, commanded out ten Souldiers; but ere they could come in to our relief, we run a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47786:220"/>
great hazard of our lives. For I was set upon on all sides, and was thrust twice with a
Pike into my Buff-collar, which certainly sav'd my life that day. There came two of the
<hi>Rasboutes</hi> so near as to lay hold on my bridle, after they had kill'd two of my foot Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and were going to carry me away prisoner. But I dispatch'd one of them with a
Pistol-shot, which I gave him in the shoulder, and the <hi>English</hi> Merchant came in to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and behav'd himself with as much gallantry as it was possible man could do. The ten
foot Souldiers belonging to the <hi>Dutch Caffila</hi> being come in, and the <hi>Caffila</hi> it self not
much behind them, the <hi>Rasboutes</hi> got into the Wood, leaving six men kill'd upon the place,
and carrying along with them many hurt. On our side we had two foot Souldiers kill'd,
and eight wounded, besides whom, the <hi>English</hi> Merchant had also received a slight wound.
From that time we kept along with the <hi>Caffila,</hi> marching in very good order, out of an
imagination we had that the <hi>Rasboutes</hi> would be sure to set on us a second time: but we
heard no more of them, and came about noon to <hi>Broitschia,</hi> where we stayed till the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
We departed thence about four of the clock that same day, in order to our crossing
the River, and that we might get five <hi>Cos</hi> further to the Village of <hi>Onclasser,</hi> where we
lodg'd that night; and the next day, being the 26. of <hi>DECEMBER,</hi> we got to
<hi>Surat.</hi>

                     </note> I found in the <hi>English</hi> Lodge above fifty Merchants, whom the
President had summon'd out of all the other Factories, to give an account of their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,

the persons following, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Metwold,</hi> the then President, Mr. <hi>Fremling,</hi> who was to
succeed him in that charge, five Consuls from several places of the <hi>Indies,</hi> three Ministers,

then present his hearty thanks, for the many expressions he had received of their fidelity
and affection during his Government, as also for the honour and respects they had rendred
the <hi>East-India</hi> Company in his person, and to intreat them to continue the same towards
Mr. <hi>Fremling,</hi> to whom he had received Order to resign up his charge, exhorting them in
all things to do that which conduced most to the reputation and advantage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
Having ended his Speech, he delivered Mr. <hi>Fremling</hi> the Letters Patents, by vertue
whereof he was to assume that new Charge, and made him a short Complement upon that
occasion.</p>
                  <p>This Ceremony ended, they went to their Garden without the City, where Mr. <hi>Metwold</hi>
had prepar'd a magnificent entertainment, consisting of whatever the Country afforded
that was excellent and rare, as also a set of <hi>English</hi> Musick, Violins, another of <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
and a third of <hi>Benjan,</hi> which for our further divertisement, was accompanied by the
Women-dancers of the Country. All which being over, Order was immediately given,
that those Ships which were fully loaden, should make all necessary Provisions for their
return, and we began to make all things ready for our Voyage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>December</hi> 28. There came to <hi>Surat</hi> a <hi>Sultan,</hi>

                     </note> sent thither by the <hi>Mogul,</hi> to succeed him
whom I had found there at my Arrival. The new President went half a League out of
the City to meet him, accompanied by five of the chiefest Merchants, who intreated me to
go along with them. The <hi>Sultan</hi> had marching before him several foot Souldiers, and a
certain number of <hi>Palanquins,</hi> and after them an Elephant, upon which a Man carried a
Banner of red Taffata. After the Elephant came above a hundred foot Souldiers, and
after them twenty other Souldiers, carrying every one a little Banner, much like those of
our Cornets, of several Colours. These march'd immediately before the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who was
mounted upon a gallant <hi>Persian</hi> Horse, and attended by several Persons of quality, and a
great number of Men on horseback. On one side of him went a Page with a great Plume
of Feathers, which serv'd for a Fan to keep off the heat of the Sun, and he had carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him his own <hi>Palanquin,</hi> which was all gilt. His name was <hi>Myrsa Mahmuda,</hi> one with
whom the new President had been acquainted long before. Having accompanied him to
his Palace, amidst the Acclamations of the people, which throng'd in the Streets to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
his Arrival, he return'd to his own house.</p>
                  <p>Immediately upon the establishment of the new President, all the other Officers and
Merchants departed one after another to the places of their ordinary Residence, and the
Ships were ordered to make all things ready to set sail. They were the <hi>Mary</hi> and the <hi>Swan;</hi>
but there were to go along with them two other Vessels, one whereof, being too old to get
home into <hi>England,</hi> was to be sold at <hi>Goa,</hi> where the President was to touch in his way;
and the other was bound for the same place, to receive fifty thousand Ryals, which the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez</hi>
were to pay, in execution of the Treaty of Peace they had made with the <hi>English,</hi> to
be imployed in the <hi>Indies,</hi> according as the President of <hi>Surat</hi> should dispose thereof.</p>

The <hi>Swan</hi> had Orders to set sail ten dayes before us, and to stay for us at the <hi>Cape of

Son, named <hi>Madofher,</hi> who being but about eleven or twelve years of age, was put under
the Guardianship of <hi>Ehamet-Chan,</hi> his Fathers Favourite. This Guardian perceiving, that
his young Master was not in a condition to protect him from the envy of those Grandees,
who had highly express'd their dissatisfaction with his Administration of the Government,
and considering with himself, that he stood in need of a more powerful Protection, made
his Applications to <hi>Achobar</hi> the <hi>Mogul,</hi> or King of <hi>Indosthan,</hi> and intreated him to come
in to the relief of his Ward, promising to deliver up <hi>Amadabath,</hi> the chief City of the
Kingdom, into his hands. <hi>Achobar</hi> thought it no prudence to neglect so favourable an
occasion, and so immediately entred <hi>Guzuratta</hi> with a powerful Army; but instead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
himself with the City of <hi>Amadabath,</hi> he became absolute Master of the whole
Kingdom, and carried away <hi>Madofher</hi> and his Guardian Prisoners to <hi>Agra. Madofher</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to thirty years of age, and beginning to reflect on the misfortune of his Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which he saw must be perpetual, combin'd with one of the most considerable Lords of
<hi>Guzuratta,</hi> who put him into possession of certain Cities of his Kingdom, such as lay at
the greatest distance from the Frontiers of the <hi>Mogul;</hi> but they gave him not the time
to settle himself therein. For <hi>Achobar</hi> immediately sent an Army thither, under the
command of <hi>Chan-Channa,</hi> who recovered the whole Kingdom in less then a year, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<hi>Madofher</hi> from making his escape, and took him prisoner. This unfortunate
Prince, reflecting on the Affronts which would be put upon him at his coming to <hi>Agra,</hi>
and fearing that <hi>Achobar</hi> would put him to death, chose rather to prevent him, and being
got to a certain place alone, under pretence of doing some necessities of Nature, cut his
own throat.</p>

who hath his ordinary Residence at <hi>Amadabath,</hi> in such manner, as that all the other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
are oblig'd to give him an account of their Administration, and to receive Orders
from him. His power is in a manner absolute: For, though in the judgment of Civil
Causes, as also when he consults about affairs of Importance, he advises with some of
the principal Lords of the Country, and of his Court; yet can it not be said, that he hath
any settled Council, but takes their Proposals, rather to discover their Sentiments, then to
follow them: Insomuch, that if his imployment were settled for a certain number of
years, he would have no cause to envy the greatness of the <hi>Mogul</hi> himself. But this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
depends meerly on the Kings pleasure, who takes occasion often to change the
Governours; as on the other side, they knowing that the least Order from the Court may
dispossess them, let slip no occasion of making their advantages, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> receiving from all
hands, especially near the time they expect to be recall'd. For then they make it their
business to get excessive sums of money out of the richest Merchants in the Country; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
those of the City of <hi>Amadabath,</hi> who are forc'd to clear themselves of false Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which they had not been charged withall, but to squeeze them of some part of their
Estates, inasmuch as the Governour being supreme Judge of all Causes, as well Civil as Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
they must either expect certain destruction, or satisfie the Governours avarice.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of the Country, professing, at least by name, the same Religion with
the <hi>Persians,</hi> occasions the <hi>Persian</hi> Language to be as common among them as the <hi>Indost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is not our design in this place to run into any discourse of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion;
but, having premised a short account of the Inhabitants of the Country, we shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
treat more at large of their Religion, and the Sects whereof it consists. They are
all of an Olive or Duskish colour, but more or less such, according to the Climate in which
they live. Those who are more towards the South, are without comparison of a much
higher colour, then those who live more towards the North. The Men are strong, and
well proportioned, having large Faces and black Eyes, and cause their Heads and Beards to
be shaven clear off, excepting only the <hi>Mustachoes,</hi> as the <hi>Persians</hi> do also. The <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
cloath themselves much after the <hi>Persian</hi> Mode, only they fold their Turbants after
another way. There is also this difference observ'd between them, that the <hi>Indosthans</hi>
have the opening of their Garments under the left Arm,<note place="margin">Their Cloaths.</note> whereas the <hi>Persians</hi> have it under
the right Arm; and that the former tye their Girdles before, and let the ends hang down,
whereas the <hi>Persians</hi> do only fold it several times about the body, and hide the ends within
the Girdle it self. It is within these Girdles that they carry their Ponyards, which they
call <hi>Limber,</hi> and are about a foot long, having the Blade much broader towards the Handle
then it is towards the Point. There are some have Swords of that making, but the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
commonly wear Cymitars. Good Horses are very scarce in those parts, whence it
comes that they often make use of Oxen, which are altogether as swift as our Horses, and
I have seen whole Troops consisting of this kind of Cavalry.<note place="margin">Their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> The Women are very well
proportioned, though of low stature. They have very handsom bodies, and are very sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in their Attire. Their Hair hangs down over their Shoulders, and on their Heads they
have only a thin Cap, or cover them with a Crepine of Lawn, wrought with Gold, the ends
whereof hang down on both sides as low as their Knees. Those who are of ability wear in
their Ears Pendants of Diamonds, Pearls, or other precious Stones, and about their Necks
Neck-laces of a kind of great round Pearl, which makes no undelightful show on the
brown complexion of the Ladies of those parts, who sometimes also wear Rings in their
Nostrils, which is so much the less incommodious to them, in that they never almost have
any occasion to wipe their Noses. They wear Breeches as well as the Men, which are of
Taffata, or some kind of Cotton-stuffe; and those of such length, that were they let out,
they would reach over their Heads. They lye close and even till they come down below
the Ham, where they are folded like Mens Boots into many folds, in regard there is a String
of Silver and Silk runs through them, wherewith they are ty'd and fastned above the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
the ends of which String hang down to their Feet. These Drawers, or Breeches, they
wear under their Smocks, which are so short, that they reach not much below their Waste;
and upon the Breeches they wear a Petticoat of Taffata, or Cotton, but so thin, that its
easie to see all under it. Their Shooes are commonly of red Cordovant, or <hi>Spanish</hi>
Leather, flat-sold, and narrow towards the Toe. They go bare-breasted, and bare-arm'd
up to the Elbows, save that much of those parts is hid by the many Bracelets
which they wear about them. Those Women, who stand upon their Honour, appear not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47786:222"/>
in publick with their Faces uncovered; nay those of any quality are very seldome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to come abroad. But the <hi>Benjan</hi> Women are clad quite after another manner.</p>
                  <p>There is no Province in the <hi>India,</hi> where there are not some <hi>Benjans;</hi> but in <hi>Guzuratta</hi>
they are more numerous then in any other place, and they are distinguish'd from the <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi>
by their habit. They do not shave their Heads, yet do they not wear their Hair
very long. They have every day a yellow Mark made in their Foreheads, of about a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
breadth, which is made with Water and Sandal-wood, in which they beat four or five
grains of Rice. They are their <hi>Bramans</hi> who give them that Mark after they have done
their Devotions before the <hi>Pagodes.</hi> The Women do not cover their Faces, as those of
the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> do; yet do they not make any difficulty to adorn themselves with Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
and Neck-laces, especially their Ears, which they in a manner cover with Pearls.
The blacker their Teeth are,<note place="margin">Black Teeth beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.</note> the greater beauty they think it. During my stay at <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabath,</hi>
some of the Women there told me, that it was an ugly thing to have white Teeth,
as Dogs and Monkeys have; and thence it came that they called us <hi>Bondra,</hi> that is, Apes.
They wear no Breeches, but only a piece of thin Silk-stuff, which they call <hi>Cabay,</hi> and
reaches down to their Hams,<note place="margin">The Cloath of the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> women.</note> and upon that they put their Smocks, and on them their upper
Garment, which they tye with a String at the Waste. Some among them wear a kind of
narrow Wastcoats, the Sleeves whereof reach but to the Elbow, being naked down from
the Breasts to the Navil. In Summer they wear wooden Shooes, which they fasten to their
Feet with Straps; but in Winter, their Shooes are of Velvet of several colours, or of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoe,
cover'd with gilt Leather. The quarters of their Shooes are very low, for this
reason, that as well Men as Women put them off, when they go into any Room, the Floor
thereof being covered with Tapistry. Children go naked, till they come to about four or
five years of Age, the Girles as well as the Boyes. The Men are very civilly apparell'd,
and live without any scandal among the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who being imperious and insolent,
treat the <hi>Benjans,</hi> as if they were their slaves, with great contempt, much after the manner
the <hi>Iews</hi> are treated in <hi>Europe,</hi> in those places where they are permitted to live. Which yet
hinders not but that the <hi>Benjans</hi> are as ingenious as the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans</hi> are ingenious.</note> and, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
more subtle, and more civil, then any of the other <hi>Indians.</hi> There are not any of
them can write and cast account better then they, nor any whose conversation is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
then theirs: but they come short of that sincerity which the others have, so that
a Man must be very cautious how he hath to do with them, in as much as there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
which they do not adulterate; and they never drive any bargain, but they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to surprize and circumvent those they are to deal with. The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English</hi>
know this by experience; whence it comes, that they make use of these people, as their
Brokers and Interpreters, that they may discover the Impostures and cheats of others.
There is no Trade which they apply not themselves to; and there is no Commodity but
they sell it, unless it be Flesh, Fish, or any other thing that hath had life. Their children
are oblig'd to match among those of the same Trade or Profession as the Father had
been of; and they suffer not those who do otherwise, to be of the same <hi>Caste,</hi> or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
but they may be the beginners of a new Trade, and yet continue in the same
Religion.</p>
                  <p>They marry their Children at seven, eight, nine, or ten years of Age, and it very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
happens that they stay till twelve, especially if they be Daughters: for, if they
stay till that time, they are look'd on as stale Maids, it being their perswasion, that
there must be some imperfection, either in the Maids person, or those of her Parents,
if there be not some Addresses made to her before that time; in which particular they
think themselves so much concern'd, that they make it a punctilio of Honour and
Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The Wedding-day being come,<note place="margin">Their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of marriage.</note> the Parents of the betrothed parties sit down in a Hall,
about a good Fire, and cause the Bridegroom and the Bride to take three turns about it,
during which, the <hi>Braman</hi> pronounces certain words, which serve for a Benediction of
the Marriage. This Custom they the more punctually observe, in regard, that, if the
Bridegroom should chance to dye before he had taken his three turns about the Fire, the
Bride might take a second Husband, which the <hi>Benjan</hi> Widows are not permitted to do,
even though the Bridegroom died before the consummation of the Marriage, but she is
obliged to suffer all her Ornaments to be taken away from her, and her Hair to be cut off.
They are not forc'd to burn themselves with the dead bodies of their Husbands, as the
Wives of the <hi>Bramans</hi> or <hi>Rasbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tes</hi> are, neither are they hindred to do it, if they have an
inclination thereto. Those Widows, who cannot brook a single life, get in among the
publick Dancers of that Sex; which must needs happen very frequently in a Climate, which
derives to the Bodies living in it no great disposition to Chastity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:47786:223"/>
The <hi>Benjan</hi> Law permits men, not only to marry a second or third time, in case of death,
but also to wed a second or third Wife,<note place="margin">The men permitted to marry twice or thrice.</note> if the first and second proves barren; the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
nevertheless a certain preheminence, as being Mother of the Family. The Sons are
Heirs of all their Fathers Estate, but with this provision, that they are to maintain the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and marry the Sisters.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Benjans</hi> are <hi>Pagans,</hi>

are indeed of a belief, That there is but one God, Creator and Preserver of the Universe;
yet does not this perswasion hinder, but that they worship the Devil, and give for their

Whence it comes, that all their <hi>Mosqueys</hi> are fill'd with representations of him, in Statues
of Gold, Silver, Ivory, Ebony, Marble, Wood, and ordinary Stone. The Figure under
which they represent him is dreadful to look on. The Head, out of which grows four
Horns, is adorn'd with a triple Crown, after the fashion of a <hi>Tiara.</hi> The countenance is
horridly deformed, having coming out of the Mouth two great Teeth, like the Tusks of a
Boar, and the Chin set out with a great ugly Beard. The Breasts beat against the Belly,
at which the Hands are not absolutely joyned together, but seem negligently to hang
down. Under the Navil, between the two Thighs, there comes out of the Belly another
Head, much more ghastly then the former, having two Horns upon it, and thrusting out of
the Mouth a filthy Tongue of extraordinary bigness. Instead of Feet it hath Paws, and
behind, a Cows-tail: This Figure is placed on a Table of Stone, which serves for an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and receives the Offerings which are made to the <hi>Pagode.</hi> On the right side of the
Altar there stands a Trough, in which those who intend to do their Devotions wash
and purifie themselves; and on the other side, there is a Box; or Chest, for reception or the
Offerings, which are made in Money; and near the Trough there is placed, within the
wall of a Vessel, out of which the <hi>Bramans</hi> take the yellow stuffe, wherewith they mark
the foreheads of those who have said their Prayers. The <hi>Braman,</hi> or Priest, belonging
to the place, sits at the foot of the Altar, whence he rises at certain times to say his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and when he goes away, he concludes his Devotions with that kind of purifying, which
is performed by rubbing his hands in the flame of the Lamps, which stand before and above
the Altar, as we have described it elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it only in great Cities that the <hi>Benjans</hi> have their many <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them also up and down the Country, upon the High-wayes, and in the Mountains and
Woods. They have no other light then what they have from the Lamps, which are kept

with the Figures of Beasts and Devils, and look more like Caves, and the Recesses
of unclean Spirits, which they are in effect, then places design'd for the exercise of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Yet it is certain nevertheless, that these poor ignorant people express as much Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for these Monsters, as the most regenerate <hi>Christians</hi> can do for their God, and the
most sacred Mysteries of their Religion; though they at the same time acknowledge, that
it is not a Divinity they adore, but a Creature which hath some power derived from God,
and is able to do good and ill to Men.</p>
                  <p>They have this common with the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> that they make the principal part of

Sun-rising, going into the Water up to the waste, and holding in their hand a Straw, which
the <hi>Braman</hi> gives them, to chase away the evil Spirit, while the <hi>Braman</hi> blesses and makes

that the <hi>Bramanes</hi> affirm, that their great God, whom they sometimes call <hi>Wistul,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Etwara,</hi> and who, they say, is the greatest, and the God of all the Gods, bethinking
himself, before the Creation of the World, when there was in the Universe but one God
and Water, meerly for his Diversion sake, to make a World, had assumed the Figure of a
little Child, and having cast himself upon a Leaf, which he had found swimming upon the
Water, and playing Childishly with his great Toe in his mouth, there came out of his Navel
a Flower, which they call <hi>Tamara,</hi> of which Flower was produced the first of all Men,
whom they call <hi>Brama.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:47786:223"/>
That the first thing which <hi>Brama</hi> did, was to give God thanks that he had bestow'd on
him a rational Soul, and that God was so well pleased with that acknowledgment of his,
that he gave him power, not only to create the World, and whatsoever is contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
but also to take upon him the Government thereof, which God was willing not to be
troubled withall himself: So that <hi>Brama,</hi> being as it were Gods Vicegerent and Deputy,
in this vast and infinite Administration, there happens not any good or evil to men but by
his means, since it is he who hath limited the life of Man to a hundred years, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
and appointed the prosperity and adversity that shall befal him.</p>
                  <p>To this they add; that <hi>Brama</hi> had five Heads, and that, one day, rebelling against the
God <hi>Wistu,</hi> He commanded one of his Servants, named <hi>Bierewa,</hi> to cut off the Head which
stood in the midst, with his Nail: But that <hi>Brama</hi> having humbled himself before God,
and having made Verses in praise of him, <hi>Wistu</hi> was so highly pleas'd to hear them sung,
that he told <hi>Brama,</hi> it troubled him much, that he had ordered one of his five Heads to be
cut off; but however, bid him be of good comfort, forasmuch as he should have the
same power with the other four, as he had before. And yet they have this belief with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that this imprudence of <hi>Brama</hi> will hinder him from enjoying, in the other World,
that measure of Glory which he might have hoped, had he continu'd in his original In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
                  <p>They affirm,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Brama's</hi> Lieutenants</note> that <hi>Brama</hi> governs the World by many Lieutenants, the chiefest of whom
is he whom they call <hi>Derwendre,</hi> who commands all those who govern the eight Worlds,
which are like this we inhabit, and go to the Composition of the Universe, whereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to them, there are seven other parts like ours, all which swim upon the water, like
so many Eggs. They believe also, that the World, which is now extant and in being, is
not any effect of the first Creation, but that there have been many before it, and that there
will be others after it. That that wherein we now live is to continue yet a Million of
Ages longer, since that in the year MDCXXXIX. there were but four thousand seven
hundred thirty nine years of the fourth Age of the World expired, and that the first bad
lasted a hundred and seven thousand two hundred and ninety Ages: That in the said first
Age of the World all Men were good and just, so as that the Devil, who was created even
in that time, had no power to do them any mischief: That in the following Age, the fourth
part of Mankind became depraved; and that in the third, good and bad were equally
divided; but that in these last times, the World was so much corrupted, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the just was reduc'd to the fourth part.</p>
                  <p>But it is besides the Design of our Relation to digress into the Theology of these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
whereof the Author we cited before hath written a Treatise, sufficient to satisfie the
curiosity of the most Learned.</p>
                  <p>We shall therefore only say,<note place="margin">The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Bramanes.</hi>
                     </note> that these <hi>Bramanes</hi> are very highly respected among the
other Pagans; not only upon the account of their austerity of life, and their extraordinary
abstinence; (for there are some of them fast three or four dayes together, not eating any
thing at all;) but also in regard, that besides their Superintendency in matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
they have the oversight of Schools, where they teach Children to read and write.
They expound the Mysteries of their Religion to the ignorant, and by that means make
what impressions they please in the minds of superstitious people, in as much as they give
what Interpretation they fancy themselves, to the Auguries and other vanities, about
which they are perpetually consulted. They are believed as so many Oracles; aad thence
it comes, that the <hi>Benjans</hi> seldom engage themselves in any business of consequence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the advice and encouragement of the <hi>Braman.</hi> They are distinguish'd from the other
<hi>Benjans,</hi> only by what they wear upon their heads, which is a Coiffure made of white Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen-cloath,
and comes several times about the Head, to cover their Hair, which they never
cut; as also by three pieces of small Packthread, which they wear next their Skins, and
come cross the Breast, from the Shoulder to the Waste, which Packthread they never put
off, nor would, though it were to save their lives. They heighten and improve the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
superstition, by the Relations they make of thousands of false Miracles, done by their
<hi>Pagodes</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> whom they perswade people to worship, as Intercessors with God for

the first Body, it transmigrates into that of some other Creature; and affirm, that the Soul
of a good natur'd and docible person, is translated into the body of a Pidgeon, or Chicken;
that of a cruel and wicked man, into that of a Crocodile, a Lyon, or a Tiger; that of a
crafty man, into that of a Fox; that of a Glutton, into the body of a Swine; that of a
treacherous person, into that of a Serpent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before they are admitted to the enjoyment
of a beatitude purely Spiritual. And this is the only reason, why the <hi>Benjans</hi> abstain from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47786:224"/>
the killing of living Creatures, even to the Insects, how dangerous or troublesome soever
they may be. They also forbear keeping any Fire, and lighting Candles in the night time,
out of a fear that the Flies or Moths should burn themselves therein; nay, they make
some difficulty to make pits on the Ground, for fear of drowning the Fleas and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects,
which might lie in the way. What is yet more superstitious, they do not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
the Birds, which the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> had taken, but they also built Hospitals for Beasts
that are hurt and wounded.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bramanes</hi> are very much respected all over the <hi>Indies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A strange imployment of the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Malabares.</hi>
                     </note> but more then any where
else, among the <hi>Malabares,</hi> where they have a very odd kind of Employment. For there
is no marriage contracted among them, but the first Fruits of the Bride are consecrated to
the <hi>Braman,</hi> to whom she is brought to be deflour'd. They believe that the marriage were
not sufficiently bless'd, if the <hi>Braman</hi> have not the first trial of the Bride; whence it
comes, that many times he is earnestly intreated before he does it; and if the persons be of
any quality, he hath a reward given him, as if he had been hired to do the work. When
the Men are to go any journey, they intreat the <hi>Braman</hi> to have a care of their Wives
while they are away, and to supply their places till they return.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Benjans</hi> are divided among themselves,<note place="margin">The Sects of the <hi>Benjans.</hi>
                     </note> into fourscore and three principal Sects; not
accounting the other less considerable ones, which are multiply'd almost to infinity, in regard
there is hardly any Family, but hath its particular Superstitions and Ceremonies. The four
principal Sects, which comprehend all the rest, are those of <hi>Ceurawath, Samarath, Bisnow,</hi>
and <hi>Goêghy.</hi> Those of <hi>Ceurawath</hi> are so punctual in the preservation of living Creatures
and Insects, that their <hi>Bramanes</hi> have their mouths cover'd with a piece of linnen-cloath,
for fear any Fly should get into it, and in their Houses they have alwayes a little Broom in
their hands, to sweep the Room, least they should negligently tread upon any Insect; and
they will not sit, till they have first made clean the seat or place where they are to sit down.
They go bare-headed and bare-foot, with a white Staffe in their hands, by which they are
distinguish'd from the others. They keep no fire in their Houses, nor light any Candles in
them. They never drink any cold water, for fear of meeting with any Insect in it, but
they have it boil'd at some ones house of their Sect.<note place="margin">Their Cloathing.</note> They have no other cloathing then
a piece of course Linnen-cloath, which hangs down from the Navel to the Knees, and cover
not the rest of their body, but with a small piece of Woollen-cloath, as much as could be
made of one Fleece of Wooll.</p>
                  <p>The Opinions they have of God are in some things different from those of the other
<hi>Benjans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Belief.</note> inasmuch as they do not attribute to him an infinite being, which disposeth of the
events of things, but they would have them to depend absolutely on good and ill fortune.
They have a Saint named <hi>Tiel Tencker,</hi> and acknowledge no other good works then Fasting
and Alms deeds: They believe that the Sun, the Moon, and other Stars, the Earth, living
Creatures, Trees, Metals, and in a word, all things visible, have in themselves the first causes
of their production and motion. They hold, that there are two Suns, and as many Moons,
which relieve one the other alternately every day. They believe nothing of Heaven or
Paradise, and yet acknowledge the immortality of the Soul, but after a very extraordinary
manner. For they affirm, that the Soul, at its departure out of the body it had first ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
enters into another, either of Man or Beast, according to the good or ill life of the
deceased: but that it ever makes choice of the Female, that it may return again into the
world, to live there in another body.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Mosqueys,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Their</hi> Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queys.</note> which they call <hi>Rales,</hi> are built four square with flat roofs, and towards
the East-side there is an open place, under which are the Chappels of their <hi>Pagodes,</hi> built
after a pyramidal form, and rais'd ten foot from the ground, having upon the stairs leading
up to them, several Figures of Wood, Stone, and Paper, representing their deceased Kindred,
whose lives had been remarkable for some extraordinary good fortune. They do their
greatest Devotions in the moneth of <hi>August,</hi> during which, they mortifie themselves by so
great abstinencies, as might pass elsewhere for no less then miraculous; it being certain,
that there are some,<note place="margin">Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

moneth or six weeks, live without taking any thing but water, into which they put the
scrapings or thavings of a certain bitter Wood, which is conceived to have somewhat of
nourishment in it. I must confess this will not easily be credited; but it is so acknowledged
a Truth in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that it is not disputed by their greatest Enemies. They have also
about that time many Assemblies in their <hi>Mosqueys,</hi> where their discourse is concerning the
lives of their departed Saints, and there are read certain Legends, the people standing about
the <hi>Braman,</hi> who sits down in the midst of them, having his mouth cover'd with a Linnen-cloath.</p>
                  <p>As they go into the <hi>Mosquey,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</note> they bestow their Charities, casting them into a great
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47786:224"/>
Copper basin, which they place before the <hi>Pagode,</hi> and in requital, they receive a mark with
the Sandal-wood, which is made in their Foreheads, or upon their Clothes. While they
are discoursing about their Saints, which lasts for the most part four or five hours, they are
entertain'd with Musick, which is paid for out of the Charities that had been collected
among them for the poor. They burn the bodies of aged persons, but bury those of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
who dye under three years of age. Their Widows are not obliged to burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their departed Husbands, but they promise perpetual Widowhood. All that
make profession of this Sect may be admitted to Priesthood. Nay, Women are receiv'd
into that Function, provided they be above twenty years of age; but the Men are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into it, at seven, eight and nine years of age. To become Priests, all they have to do,
is to put on the habit, to accustom themselves to the austerity of that kind of life, and to
make a vow of Chastity. Any one of the married couple hath the priviledge to become
a Priest, and by that means, to oblige the other to celibate, for the remainder of his or her
life. There are some make a Vow of Chastity in the state of marriage; but this is seldom
seen, and when it is, those who make such Vows, are not overstrict in the observance of
them.</p>
                  <p>All the other <hi>Castes,</hi> or Sects of the <hi>Benjanes,</hi> have an aversion and contempt for this,
and condemn it so much, that their Doctors continually exhort their Auditours to shun the
Conversation of those people; so that they will not only not eat or drink with them, but
they would not so much as set a foot in their Houses, though it were to avoid an imminent
and inevitable danger; and such as are so unhappy as to touch them, are obliged to do a
publick and severe pennance.</p>
                  <p>The second Sect of the <hi>Benjans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Sect of <hi>Samarath.</hi>
                     </note> called <hi>Samarath,</hi> hath this common with the former,
that it permits not the killing of any Creature or Insect that hath life, nor the eating of
any thing that hath had it. This Sect consists of Lock-makers, Smiths, Farriers, Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Taylors, Shooe-makers, Furbishers, and all other Tradesmen, admitting among them,
even Souldiers,<note place="margin">Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</note> Clerks, and other Officers. Their Religion is different from that of the
former, in that they believe, that this World was created by a first cause, which governs and
preserves all, with a soveraign and unchangeable power.</p>
                  <p>They call him in their Language <hi>Permiseer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their God and his Substitutes.</note> and assign him three Substitutes, who have
their several Functions under his Superintendency. The first, who is called <hi>Brama,</hi> hath
the disposal of all Souls, which he sends into such Bodies as <hi>Permiseer</hi> appoints, either of
Men or Beasts. The second, whom they call <hi>Buffiuna,</hi> teaches the World to live according
to Gods Commandments, which they have disposed into four Books. He hath also the
oversight of Provisions, and advances the growth of Wheat, Herbs and Pulse, after <hi>Brama</hi>
hath endued them with Souls. The third, named <hi>Mais,</hi> exercises his power over the dead.
He is also Secretary to <hi>Permiseer,</hi> and takes the good and bad works of the deceased into
examination, that he may make a report thereof to his Master, who having examin'd both
the one and the other, sends the Soul into a Body, where she doth more or less pennance,
proportionably to the good or ill she hath done in the former. Those that are sent into
the body of a Cow, are accounted the most happy, in regard that that Beast having some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Divine in it, according to their opinion, they hope in a short time to be purified of
the sins which they had committed during their continuance in the former body. But
those which are forc'd to take up their second habitations in the bodies of Elephants, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,
wild Oxen, Goats, Asses, Leopards, Swine, Serpents, or any other unclean Beast, are on
the contrary thought most unhappy, inasmuch as at their departure out of them, they
pass into the bodies of other Beasts, either tame, or less wild, where they compleat the
expiation of the Crimes for which they were condemned to those punishments. The same
thing happens also to those souls which are in the bodies of some Creatures that dye
before they have compleated their Purification; which being absolutely consummated,
<hi>Mais</hi> presents the Souls so purified to <hi>Permiseer,</hi> who receives them into the number of his
Servants.</p>
                  <p>They burn the bodies of the deceas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

age; but they have this particular Ceremony, that these Obsequies are performed on the
side of a River or Brook, whither they carry the sick persons, when they are past hopes
of recovery, that they may expire there.</p>
                  <p>There is no Sect,<note place="margin">The Women burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death. The reason of it.</note> in which the Women sacrifice themselves so cheerfully to the memory
of their Husbands, as in this Sect of <hi>Samarath.</hi> For they are perswaded, that the promise
which <hi>Buffiuna</hi> makes them, in the Law he gave them from <hi>Permiseer,</hi> is infallible; to wit,
that if a Woman hath so great an affection for her Husband, as to burn her self with him
after his death, she shall live with him in the other World seven times as long, and shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
him with seven times as much satisfaction as she had done in this: which hope makes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47786:225"/>
them look on death, but as a passage, through which they are to enter into a beatitude and
bliss, whereof they had in this world but a small earnest.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the Women are delivered, there is presented to the new born Child, an Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,
Paper and Pens, and if it be a Boy, they add a Bow and Arrows; to signifie that
<hi>Buffiuha</hi> will write his Law in his understanding, and that one day he shall raise his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
by the Wars. For as we said before, this Sect admits of Souldiers: but those among
them, whose Profession it is to bear Arms, make a distinct Sect, which they call that of the
<hi>Rasboutes,</hi> of whom we shall give an account anon.</p>
                  <p>Those of the Sect of <hi>Bisnow</hi> have this common with the two precedent,<note place="margin">The Sect of <hi>Bisnow.</hi>
                     </note> that they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from feeding on any thing that hath had life. They fast also, and in the moneth of
<hi>August</hi> have their Assemblies in their <hi>Agoges;</hi> so they call their <hi>Mosqueys.</hi> Their principal
Devotion consists in singing of Hymns to the honour of their God,<note place="margin">Their God.</note> whom they call <hi>Ram-ram,</hi>
and pray, to bless them and their Families with a supply of what they think necessary,
that they may live without discontent and inconvenience. Their singing is accompany'd
with dancing, and Musick, consisting of Drums, Pipes, Copper-basins, and other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
upon which they play before their Idols. They represent their <hi>Ram-ram,</hi> with his
Wife, in several manners, and adorn both their Statues on Holy-dayes, with many Gold
Chains, Collars of Pearl, and all sorts of precious Stones, and set up many Lamps, and Wax-candles
before them. This God hath no Substitutes, as that of the Sect of <hi>Samarath,</hi> but
doth all himself.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary sustenance of the <hi>Bisnow</hi> is only Herbs and Pulse, fresh Butter, Milk and
Curds.<note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life.</note> They are great lovers of the <hi>Atschia,</hi> which is a certain Composition made of
Ginger, <hi>Mangas,</hi> Citrons, Garlick, and Mustard-seed pickled with Salt, and drink only Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or <hi>Baratte.</hi> They are either Women or Priests that dress their meat; and instead of
Wood, which they forbear burning, because there are sometimes Worms in it, which might
by that means be destroyed,<note place="margin">Their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which they cut in square pieces, as they do the Turfs in <hi>Holland,</hi> and so expose it to
sale.</p>
                  <p>Those of this Sect are for the most part addicted to Merchandise, either upon their own
account, or as Agents and Factors under others. They understand the business of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
extreamly well, and their Conversation is not unpleasant; whence it comes that
both <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> employ them as Brokers and Interpreters, in their way of
Trading.</p>
                  <p>They have this particular Custom in this Sect,<note place="margin">Their Wives are not burnt.</note> that they permit not the Women to burn
themselves with their Husbands; but they oblige them to perpetual widowhood, even
though the Husband died before the consummation of the marriage. It is not long since,
that among them, the younger Brother was oblig'd to marry his elder Brothers Widow, to
raise up seed to him; but this custome is abolish'd by an express Law which condemns the
Women to celibate.</p>
                  <p>In the morning they all wash themselves in a <hi>Tanque,</hi> or rather in a River, if there be any
near the place where they live, and they think it not enough to go into it up to the Waste,
but they tumble, wallow, and swim in it, muttering certain words between their Teeth,
while the <hi>Braman,</hi> who sits on the River-side and looks to their Cloaths, gives them his
Benediction, and prayes God that they may be as clean from their sins, as their bodies are
clear of filth. At their coming out of the water he rubs their Foreheads, Noses and Ears,
with a certain Composition made of Sandal, or some other Odoriferous wood, and they
give him for his pains a small quantity of Wheat, Rice or Pulse.</p>

worship their God <hi>Bruin,</hi> and his Servant <hi>Mecis.</hi> They have neither <hi>Mosqueys,</hi> nor any
other publick places,<note place="margin">Their God.</note> wherein to assemble to do their Devotions; nay will not go into the
<hi>Mosqueys</hi> of the other <hi>Benjans,</hi> unless it be into those of the Sect of <hi>Samarath;</hi> but it is
only to take up their Lodging in them for want of other accommodation. For they are
forbidden by their Law to be proprietors of any thing. They shun the conversation of
Men, and live in Woods and Desarts, like the Hermits and ancient A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>chorites. They have
nothing about them, but a piece of Linnen-cloath, to cover that part which Nature is
unwilling should be expos'd to the view of all. They rub their Bodies all over with
Ashes, and when-ever they sit down, they have a little heap of Ashes near them, which they
are perpetually handing, and scatter of it upon their moist Hair, which disfigures them
after a strange manner. They never speak to such as pass by them, nor give them
the time of the day; nay, they will not answer those that speak to them, out of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
that being consecrated to their God <hi>Bruin,</hi> they believe they should defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47786:225"/>
by speaking to other men. Whence it happens, that when they come into any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they make no stay therein, and will not turn out of that Street which leads them to the
Gate they would go out at. Wherein they are so scrupulous, that they will not ask for
any thing, though they were ready to starve. They will indeed receive what is give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them, but if there be nought given them they live on Herbs and Roots, which they find
in the fields. There are some among them that have three or four servants, who put
themselves voluntarily into their service, that they may participate of their sanctity: but
all the service they do them is what they list themselves. For the Masters never command
them to do any thing, nay not what is most necessary to life. All the other <hi>Benjans</hi> have
a certain veneration for the <hi>Goêghys,</hi> except it be those of the <hi>Caste,</hi> or Sect of <hi>Ceurawath,</hi>
who have a horrour for them, and shun their conversation.</p>
                  <p>There are some among them have a greater reputation of knowledge and sanctity then
others, but they make no advantage thereof, in as much as their condition is equal. They
never marry, but live in so great observance of Chastity, that they would not suffer a
Woman to touch them. The common people hath a great devotion for these <hi>Goêghys,</hi>
saluting them with much respect, and receiving their Benediction with great submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Goêghys</hi> believe,<note place="margin">Their belief.</note> that their God <hi>Bruin</hi> hath created all things, and that he continues
them in being, by his infinite power, by which he is able to destroy and reduce them to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>They affirm, that he is not to be represented by any Figure of either Man or Beast, but
that he is a light, which cannot be the Object of our sight, inasmuch as, having created that
of the Sun, it is not to be admired, that we cannot contemplate the principle of so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
a brightness.</p>
                  <p>They believe not the Transmigration of Souls,<note place="margin">Hold not the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of Souls.</note> as the other <hi>Benjans</hi> do; but affirm, that
the Souls at their departure out of the body, are immediately transferred to their God
<hi>Bruin,</hi> to live with him eternally, and to be united to that infinite Light.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that Charcoal-men and Chimney-sweepers among us are not so besmutted
as these people, who take a pleasure in disfiguring their bodies and countenances, not only
by the Ashes wherewith they continually rub them, but also by their abstinences, which as
they are greater, so are they withall much more frequent then those of the <hi>Benjans</hi> of the
Sect of <hi>Ceurawath.</hi> There are some Women become <hi>Goêghys,</hi> but in regard that Sex is
too tender and delicate, to accustom themselves to so great austerity, their number is not
very great.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Benjans</hi> oblige their Proselytes,<note place="margin">A strange manner of living.</note> that is, the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who embrace their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to a very extravagant manner of life. For, to renew their whole body, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Opinion, is defiled by the flesh they had eaten, they oblige them for the
space of six moneths together, to mix amongst what they are to eat, a pound of Cow-dung;
out of this reason, that that Creature having, as they hold, some thing divine in it, here is
nothing can purifie the body so well as that kind of nourishment, which their Proselytes
are permitted to diminish by degrees, after the three first moneths of their conversion. They
also condemn to that kind of Diet, those of their own Sect, who having been prisoners
among the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> or <hi>Christians,</hi> or conversing ordinarily among them, have been
perswaded to eat flesh, or drink wine; and receive them not into their communication, till
such time as they have been purified in that manner.</p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Benjans</hi> are extreamly superstitious.<note place="margin">The super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans.</hi>
                     </note> For they never go out of their houses, till
they have said their Prayers; and if at their going out they meet with any ill presage,
they return into their houses, and do not any business of importance that day. They take
to presage ill Fortune, the meeting of an empty Cart, a wild Oxe, an Ass, a Dog, if he be
not eating somewhat, a Goat, an Ape, a Deer, a Goldsmith, a Carpenter, a Lock-smith, a
Barber, a Taylor, a beater of Cotton, a Widow, a company of People going to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a dead Body, or a Man returning from the same Ceremony; as also, that of a
Man or Woman carrying Butter, Oyl, Milk, brown-Sugar, Citrons, or any other sharp
things, Apples, Iron, or any thing relating to War. They are on the contrary, well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the meeting of an Elephant, or Camel, whether they be loaden or not, as also of a
Horse, a Cow, an Oxe, a wild Oxe loaden with water, a He-Goat, a Dog eating, a Cat
coming on the right hand of them, and Persons loaden with Provisions, Curds and white-Sugar;
but above all, that of a Cock, or a Hare, and then they cheerfully go about what
they have to do, as being prepossess'd with the opinion they have, that the success of their
Affairs will be answerable to their expectations.</p>
                  <p>There are some who put the <hi>Rasboutes</hi> into the number of the <hi>Benjans,</hi>

they are a branch of the Sect of <hi>Samarath,</hi> with which they believe the transmigration
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47786:226"/>
of Souls, and several other things. But they believe this in particular, that the Souls of
Men go into Birds, who afterwards give their Friends notice of the good and evil which
is to befall them: upon which account it is, that they so superstitiously observe the flight
and singing of those Creatures. Their Widows burn themselves with the bodies of their
deceased Husbands, unless it be, that, at the contract of Marriage, there was some promise
made that they should not be forc'd thereto. But whereas all the other <hi>Benjans</hi> are of a
mild and reserv'd disposition, abhorring the effusion of bloud, even that of Beasts; these
on the contrary, are a sort of violent and daring people, who eat flesh, and live only by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and rapine, and never mind any other profession then that of Arms. The <hi>Mogul</hi>
makes use of these Men, as do also most of the other Princes of the <hi>Indies,</hi> because they
are undaunted, and entertain not the least fear of death. To this purpose, there is a Story
of five <hi>Rasboutes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Story of five <hi>Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boutes.</hi>
                     </note> who forc'd by weariness to rest themselves in a Country mans house,
there happened to be a Fire in the Village, which by reason of the wretchedness of the
houses, soon came to that where they were. They had notice of it, but one of them said
to the rest, that having never turn'd their backs from danger, it would be the greatest
shame in the world to them, to shun death, which they had never fear'd: That it were
baseness in them to stir thence, but that they were to make the Fire as much afraid of
them, as others were of it, and force it to stop its progress when it came near them; and
they were so earnestly engag'd in these temerarious and extravagant discourses, that the
Fire getting into the Room where they were, one only had the time to get out, and to
drag along with him one of his Camerades, who could never afterwards be recover'd out
of the melancholly regret he had conceiv'd, at his not having follow'd the example of the
others.</p>
                  <p>It is related also of another <hi>Rasboute,</hi> who going into the Country, in the company of
two others, came in his way to a Pit, at the sight whereof his Horse stood still; but the
<hi>Rasboute</hi> condemning the caution of the Beast, as if it had proceeded from fearfulness,
told him, that he was very much to blame to entertain any fear, having on his back a Man
that never knew any; and thereupon beating him, he would have made him leap over
the Pit; but, both Horse and Man falling, they were both drown'd, the Man acquiring
among them, by this inconsiderable and brutish action, the reputation of a Man heroically
courageous.</p>
                  <p>They have no compassion but what they have towards irrational Creatures, especially
Birds,<note place="margin">Their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their Souls shall be lodg'd in Creatures of that kind, some or other will have the same cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
towards them. And this is their employment particularly on Holy-dayes, as also for
ten or twelve dayes after the decease of their nearest Kindred, and upon the anniversary
dayes of their death.</p>
                  <p>They have this common with the other <hi>Benjans,</hi> that they marry their Children very
young,<note place="margin">They marry their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren very young.</note> which is the less to be wondred at, inasmuch as it is very certain, that the <hi>Indians</hi>
of both Sexes are capable of engendring much sooner then any other Nation: so that
there are not any but are fit for the work of generation at ten or twelve years of age. To
this purpose I have a Story, which may seem fabulous, but I have it from such grave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that I shall make no difficulty to communicate it upon their credit.</p>
                  <p>Not many years since,<note place="margin">A remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Story.</note> even in the reign of <hi>Scach Choram,</hi> who is yet living, a certain
<hi>Rasboutes</hi> Wife, who liv'd at <hi>Agra,</hi> was brought to bed of a Daughter, which at two years
of age had Breasts as big as those of any Nurse. A Lock-smith, neighbour to the <hi>Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute,</hi>
advised the Father and Mother to permit, that the hot Iron might be apply'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
which is the ordinary remedy they make use of against superfluous humours. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
thereto; but as soon as they had applied the foresaid Remedy, the Lock-smith died,
and soon after, the Father and Mother, and all those that had been present at the said cure.
The child had at three years of age, what those of her Sex are not wont to have till
twelve or thirteen. The year after she had nothing of that kind, but her Belly was so
swollen as if she had been with child. That swelling was little abated the year following,
and at six years of age she was brought to bed of a Boy. But this was thought a thing
so extraordinary all over the Country, though they marry very young, as I said before, that

Court.</p>
                  <p>Besides the <hi>Benjans,</hi> there is yet another sort of <hi>Pagans</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Guzuratta,</hi>
whom they call the <hi>Parsis.</hi>

                        <hi>The</hi> Parsis.</note> These are the <hi>Persians</hi> of <hi>Fars</hi> and <hi>Chorasan,</hi> who fled into
those parts, to avoid the persecution of the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> in the seventh Age. For <hi>Abube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
having undertaken to establish the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion in <hi>Persia</hi> by force of Arms, the
King perceiving it was impossible for him to oppose it, took shipping with eighteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

men at <hi>Ormus,</hi> and landed in <hi>Indosthan.</hi> The King of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> who was a <hi>Hindou,</hi>
or <hi>Indian,</hi> that is, a <hi>Pagan,</hi> as himself, received him to dwell in his Country, into which that
liberty drew several other <hi>Persians,</hi> who, with their Religion, have preserv'd and continued
their ancient manner of life.<note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life.</note> Their habitations are for the most part along the Sea-coast,

they make <hi>Arak,</hi> in regard they are permitted to drink Wine. They intermeddle also
with Merchandise, and the exchange of Money, and keep Shops, and are of all Trades,
except those of Farriers, Black-smiths, and Lock-smiths; in regard it is an unpardonable
sin among them to put out the fire.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Parsis</hi> believe that there is but one God, Preserver of the Universe: That he acts
alone, and immediately, in all things; and that the seven Servants of God, for whom they
have also a great Veneration, have only an inferiour administration, whereof they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to give an account.</p>
                  <p>The first of these Servants is called <hi>Hamasda,</hi>

the living Creatures that are upon Earth.</p>

                  <p>The fourth is called <hi>Sarywar,</hi> and is entrusted with the charge of Metals, about which
they are very curious; and accuses those who neglect the making of them clean; which
negligence is a mortal sin among them.</p>

over the Earth, and keeps it from being defiled with filth.</p>
                  <p>The seventh, whom they call <hi>Ammadath,</hi> looks to the preservation of Fruits, Trees,
Herbs and Pulse, but without any power either to advance or retard their production.
For these seven subalternate Spirits are appointed by God, only to take cognizance of the
abuses committed in this World, and to make their report thereof to him.</p>
                  <p>Besides these seven Servants,<note place="margin">Twenty six other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God.</note> whose dignity is very great, God hath twenty six other
Servants, who have all their particular Functions.</p>

                        </gap>ros,</hi> to be examined, and to receive according to their Sentence, either its condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
or absolution from its sins. Their manner of proceeding in judgment, is, to put the
good and evil Works into two Scales, that they may judge of them according to their
weight. The good and evil Angels stand about the Scales, and carry away the Souls ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to them, either into Paradise, where they enjoy eternal bliss, or into Hell, there to be
tormented to the end of the World, which they believe will be renewed at the expiration
of a thousand years; and then, they shall enter into other Bodies, to lead a better life then
they had done in the former.</p>
                  <p>The fourth of these Servants is called <hi>Beram,</hi> and hath the oversight of all Military af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
upon which account it is that they address themselves to him, that they may obtain
of God Victory, by his Intercession.</p>
                  <p>The fifth is <hi>Carraseda,</hi> that is to say, the Sun.</p>
                  <p>The sixth <hi>Auva,</hi> that is, the Water.</p>
                  <p>The seventh is called <hi>Ader,</hi> and governs the Fire, under <hi>Ardy besth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The eighth is <hi>Moho,</hi> or the Moon.</p>
                  <p>The ninth is <hi>Tiera,</hi> that is, Rain.</p>
                  <p>The tenth, called <hi>Gos,</hi> hath the oversight of Cattel.</p>
                  <p>The eleventh, who is called <hi>Farwardy,</hi> hath the custody of the Souls which are in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.</p>
                  <p>The twelfth, named <hi>Aram,</hi> is he that gives Joy or Sadness to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>The thirteenth, named <hi>Goada,</hi> governs the Winds, and makes them blow as he
pleaseth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dien,</hi> who is the fourteenth, teaches Men the Law of God, and inspires them with good
motions to observe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Apirsanich,</hi> who is the fifteenth, is he who bestows Wealth on Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Astaet,</hi> who is the sixteenth, is he that gives Men Understanding and Memory.</p>
                  <p>The seventeenth, whom they call <hi>Assaman,</hi> is Superintendent over Commerce.</p>
                  <p>The eighteenth, called <hi>Gamigat,</hi> hath the Government of the Earth.</p>

                     <hi>Marispan,</hi> who is the nineteenth, is Goodness it self, who is communicated to those that
invocate him.</p>
                  <p>They call the twentieth <hi>Amiera,</hi> and his Presidentship is over Money, whereof he hath
the disposal.</p>
                  <p>The one and twentieth is called <hi>Hoêm,</hi> and is he, without whose concurrence there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
no Generation of Men, or Beasts, or Production of Fruits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dimma</hi> and <hi>Berse,</hi> are indifferently design'd to attend all Men: and the three remaining,
whom they call <hi>Dephader, Dephemer,</hi> and <hi>Dephdin,</hi> are engag'd upon the particular Service
of God, who imployes them about all Affairs indifferently.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Parsis,</hi> who call these twenty six Servants by one general name, <hi>Geshoo,</hi> that is to
say, Lords, believe, that they have an absolute power over the things whereof God hath
entrusted them with the Administration. Whence it comes, that they make no difficulty
to worship them, and to invocate them in their extremities, out of a perswasion, that God
will not deny them any thing they desire upon their Intercession.</p>
                  <p>They have a very great respect for their Doctors and Teachers, and allow them a very
plentiful subsistance, with their Wives and Children, though some among them intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
also with Merchandise, which they are permitted to do according to their Law; but
these are not so highly esteemed, as those others who spend all their time in teaching Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to read and write,<note place="margin">They have no <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queys.</hi>
                     </note> and explicating their Law to the people. They have no <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>squeys,</hi>
nor other publick places, for the Exercise of their Religion: but they make use, to that
purpose, of some room in their houses, where they do their devotions sitting, and without
any inclination of the body.</p>
                  <p>Nor have they any particular day in the week design'd for that end, but they observe
the first, and twentieth day of the Moon. Though their Moneths consist of thirty dayes
a piece, yet does their Year consist of 365. dayes, for they add five dayes to the last Moneth.
Their Priests are not known by their habit, in regard it is common to them, not only with
all the rest of the <hi>Parsis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The bodge of their Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> but also with all the other Inhabitants of the Country; from
whom they are distinguish'd by a String or Wreath of Wooller Camels Hair, wherewith
they make them a Girdle, which comes twice about the body, and is ty'd with two knots
behind, which is the only distinctive mark of their Religion, and so inseparable from their
Profession, that if it happen to be lost, he who is so unfortunate as to have lost it, may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eat, nor drink, nor speak, nay not stir from the place where he is till another be brought
him from the Priest who sells them. The Women wear of them as well as the Men, after
they are come to twelve years of age, at which time they are thought capable of compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
the Mysteries of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Their houses are little and dark,<note place="margin">Their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> very poorly furnish'd, and they have a great affection
to live in the same quarter. They have no particular Magistrate among them, yet do they
not think much to accept of the employments which the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> give them, and
create among themselves two of the most considerable of the Nation, who decide
such differences as may arise, and for which they never plead before any other
Judges.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing so precious among them as Fire,<note place="margin">Fire is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred among them.</note> which they keep in very carefully,
upon this account, as they affirm, that there is not any thing affords so lively a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Divinity as Fire does. Whence it comes, that they never put out a Candle, or
a Lamp, and never make use of Water to quench the Fire, though the House were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being burnt; but they endeavour to smother it with Earth. For it is the greatest
misfortune can happen to them, to find the Fire so far out in their Houses, as that they must
be forc'd to go out among their Neighbours to get some.</p>
                  <p>They also marry their Children while they are very young, but they suffer the Parents
to bring them up at their own Houses, till they are come to fifteen or sixteen years of age,
and then they consummate the marriage. Their Widows are permitted to marry the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time; whence it comes that there are not so many disorders committed among them,
as there are among the other Nations.<note place="margin">They se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</note> But Adultery and Fornication are the greatest sins
they can commit, and which, no doubt, they would punish with death, if they had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Justice in their own hands.</p>
                  <p>When any one is so sick, as that there is little hopes of his recovery, he is taken out of
his bed,<note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</note> to be laid on a little bed of green Turfs upon the ground, where he lies till he give
up the ghost, and immediately after, five or six Men, whose imployment it is to make the
Graves, take him from the said Pallat of Turfs, put a Shroud about him, and lay him upon
an Iron-grate, made after the form of a Biere, upon which they carry the body to the place
of burial, which is above a League from the City. These places, or, if we may call them
so, Church-yards, are divided into three parts, all inclosed with a Wall of twelve or fifteen
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47786:227"/>
foot high, one whereof is for the Men, another for the Women, and the third for Children.
Over the Graves there are Bars laid cross like a Grate, upon which they lay the body, there
to remain till the Crows and other devouring Birds have consumed them, so as that the Bones fall into the Grave. The Kindred and Friends accompany the Corps with horrid
cries and lamentations, and make a halt when they are come within 500. paces of the
Grave, till such time as the Grave-makers have laid it upon the Grate, and made certain
Prayers for the Sonl. About a moneth or six weeks after, they carry the Turfs upon which
the deceased party died, to the Church-yard, as a thing polluted, which they would not so
much as touch; and every moneth they make a Feast for the nearest of the Kindred, in
memory of the departed. If it happens that they touch a dead Carkass, or the Bones of
a dead Beast, they are oblig'd to cast off their cloaths, to cleanse their bodies, and to do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for nine dayes together, during which, neither Women nor Children dare come near
them. They are of this particular perswasion, that they whose Bones chance to fall into
the Water, are irrecoverably damned.</p>
                  <p>Their Law forbids the eating of ought that hath had life; yet are not these prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
so rigorous, but that in case of necessity, nay even in the time of war, they kill Sheep,
Goats, tame Fowl and Fish, and eat thereof: But they religiously abstain from the Oxe and
Cow, nor do they kill Elephants, Camels, Horses or Hares; but as to the Oxe and Cow,
they forbear them so strictly, that they commonly say, they had rather feed on their Fathers
and Mothers then eat of an Oxe or Cow.</p>
                  <p>They are permitted to drink Wine and Terry,<note place="margin">Drun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and above all things, being overcome with drunkenness: This is a sin among them,
which cannot be expiated without undergoing a very severe pennance, which a man must
either submit to, or be content to quit their communion.</p>
                  <p>Their stature is none of the greatest, but they are of a clearer Complexion then any of
the other <hi>Indosthans,</hi> and their Women are beyond comparison whiter and fairer then those
of the Country, or those of the <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> The Men wear great bushy Beards, cut
round or somewhat Spade-wise. Some cut off their Hair, others let it grow to the full
length. Those who cut their Hair, leave growing on their Crowns a Lock or Tust about
an inch in compass.</p>
                  <p>They are the most self-ended and covetous sort of people in the World, using all possible
industry to over-reach and circumvent those they trade withall, though otherwise they
have an aversion for theft. They are of a better Nature then the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> at least if
it may be said there is any good Nature consistent with a self-seeking mind, when it is once
possessed with the basest and most infamous of all Vices, Avarice.</p>
                  <p>There are in the Kingdom of <hi>Guzuratta</hi> two other sorts of Pagans,<note place="margin">

are not <hi>Benjans,</hi> inasmuch as they kill all sorts of Beasts, and eat thereof, excepting only the
Oxe and Cow. They eat their Meals within a Ring or Circle, within which they permit
not the <hi>Benjans</hi> to enter. They are for the most part Souldiers, and the <hi>Mogul</hi> makes use
of them for the keeping of the most considerable places of his Kingdom. The other sort
comes out of the Kingdom of <hi>Baghenal,</hi> which is commonly called the Kingdom of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

honour by their heroick Actions; and it is to this kind of Saints that they build <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They believe the Immortality and Transmigration of Souls, upon which perswasion
they abhor the effusion of bloud. Accordingly are there not to be found any Robbers or
Murtherers among them; but on the other side, they are generally Lyars and Cheats, in
which good qualities they exceed all the other <hi>Indians.</hi> They severely punish Adultery,
but they so openly permit Fornication, that there are whole Families among them, whom
they call <hi>Bagawaro,</hi> who prostitute themselves publickly.</p>
                  <p>Besides all these, they have yet among them another sort of people, whom they call
<hi>Theers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theers.</note> who are neither <hi>Pagans</hi> nor <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> for they have no Religion at all. They
are altogether imployed about the scouring of Wells, Sinks, Common-Shores, and Privies,
as also the fleaing of dead Beasts, whose flesh they eat.</p>
                  <p>They also conduct condemn'd persons to punishment, and are sometimes the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of them. Whence it comes that they are an abomination to all the other <hi>Indians,</hi>
who are oblig'd to purifie themselves from head to foot, if any of these people, whom, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that occasion, they call <hi>Alchores,</hi> should touch them. Which is the reason that they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47786:228"/>
suffer them not to live within Cities, but assign them Habitations in the extremities of the
Suburbs, that they may be as far as may be conveniently from the conversation of other
men.</p>
                  <p>We shall not make it our business here to speak of the Religion of the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi>

of the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which is much different from that of the <hi>Turks</hi> and
<hi>Persians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We will begin with their Ceremonies of Marriage.<note place="margin">The marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Indian Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
                     </note> The Friends on both sides being
agreed, and the Wedding-day appointed, there is brought to the Bridegrooms door a Horse,
whose Mane and Crupper are beset with all sorts of Flowers, as is also the piece of Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
wherewith they cover the Bridegrooms face, who gets on horseback, accompanied
by his Kindred and Friends, having on each side two Pages carrying Umbrelloes of painted
Paper, and before him Musick, and certain Men, who cast into the Air, Squibs, Crackers, and
other Fire-works. In this Equipage he passes through the principal Streets of the City,
and at last comes to the Brides door, where he entertains her with his Musick and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
for the space of half an hour. Then he goes into the house, where he sits down on
pieces of Tapistry, purposely set there for that Ceremony; and whither the Bride comes
to him accompanied by her Kindred, and the <hi>Molla</hi> and <hi>Kasi,</hi> or Judge of the place. The
<hi>Molla</hi> reads certain passages of the <hi>Alchoran;</hi> and after he hath taken the Bridegrooms
Oath, that in case of Divorce, he will provide for the subsistence of his Wife, he blesses the
marriage, and goes his way. The rest of the company stay in the room to eat <hi>Bettelé,</hi> and
some other Drugs, but they drink no Wine, instead whereof, they take Pills of <hi>Amsion</hi> or
<hi>Opium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The effects of <hi>Opium.</hi>
                     </note> which works the same effect, and intoxicates them as Wine does. The Kindred
and Friends continue their Assemblies, five or six, sometimes eight or ten dayes together,
especially when the marks of the Consummation of marriage are apparent upon the sheets
of the new married couple. But if the Bridegroom find it more beaten and common then
he expected, he uses it as a high-way, and without any more ado abandons it to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
as on the contrary, if he be not able to force himself a passage, and that in the three
or four first dayes of his marriage, he gives not visible assurances of his abilities in the work
he hath undertaken, one of the Brides nearest Kinswomen sends him a Distaffe, with this
message; That since he is incapable of doing mans work, 'tis but fit he should be put to
womans.</p>
                  <p>Their marriages are not indissoluble,<note place="margin">They may be divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</note> as they are among <hi>Christians,</hi> nay indeed among the
other <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> among whom there is no Divorce made, till the grievances of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
be first examined, and after that, not without the authority of the Judge. But here the
men make it an express Article in their Contracts of marriage, that they may be divorced,
not only in case of Adultery or sterility, but also in case of ever so little aversion they may
conceive against their Wives; provided some course be taken by them for their subsistence,
during their lives.</p>
                  <p>Not a word of any restitution of Dower, in regard the Women there do not bring their
Husbands any thing besides their Clothes and Jewels: Nor indeed is there any but have
their Pendants, Rings and Bracelets, of each good store.</p>
                  <p>The Women go seldom abroad, and those that are of any quality go in close Coaches, or
are carried in <hi>Palanquins,</hi> or Litters, according to the <hi>Indian</hi> mode. There are indeed
those who ride on horseback, but they have their faces cover'd with a Skarf; so that they
are only the meaner sort, or the common ones, that go a foot, or are seen with their faces
uncovered. They are deliver'd without any pain almost, in so much that it is seldom seen
there that Women are above two or three hours in labour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> bring up their Children with much care and tenderness,<note place="margin">They bring up their Children well.</note> send them to
School as soon as they are capable of learning any thing; and there they are taught to
read and write. Those who are not of ability to maintain their Children at School, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
them on some person of quality, or send them to the Wars, as soon as they are able to
bear Arms. They who put themselves into the service of others, enter into a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
condition; inasmuch as they are allow'd but three or four <hi>Ropias</hi> a moneth, towards
meat, drink and cloath.</p>
                  <p>It is observed, that the Children of the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> have a particular tenderness of
those that brought them into the world; nay, that it is sometimes so great, that they would
rather starve themselves, then suffer those from whom they derive their life, should want
any thing requisite for the preservation of their own.</p>

                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:47786:228"/>
There is hardly any person of quality, but makes him a handsom Garden, within which
he builds a fair house, having a great number of little windows of all sides, which is to

Structures they lay out vast sums of money.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremonies of their Interments are these.<note place="margin">Their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Immediately upon the Departure, the
Kindred bewail the deceased, and ask him, why he would dye? and whether he wanted
those conveniences which he should have had? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then they dine, and there is a Feast
made, in memory of the deccased. In the mean time, the Body is well washed, there is a
clean perfum'd Sheet wrapped about it, and it is put into an open Coffin, from which three
or four <hi>Mollas</hi> never stir, but continue near the Body, reading and praying for the Soul of
the deceased, till it be carried to the ground. The Coffin is cover'd with Cotton, Velvet,
or some other more precious Stuffe, according to the abilities of the deceas'd, and the
Kindred and Friends accompany the Body, which is carried by ten or twelve Men to the
place of burial, the <hi>Mollas</hi> singing in the mean time certain Hymnes, of thanksgiving
Songs, to the glory of God. The Body is laid down upon the right side, with the Face
turned towards the West, the Feet towards the South, and the Head towards the North;
and the Coffin is covered with a board, to keep the Earth from touching the Body, and
defiling it. While the Body is let down into the Grave, the Kindred mutter certain Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
between their teeth; and that done, all the company returns to the house of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
where the <hi>Mollas</hi> continue their Prayers for his Soul, for the space of two or three
dayes: and during all this time, there is no fire made within the house, but the meat is
dressed elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>They assume the quality of <hi>Mussulmans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">They are called <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulmans</hi> or <hi>Mussul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                     </note> and believe that there is no salvation out of their
Communion, treating as Hereticks and Infidels, not only the <hi>Christians,</hi> but also all such as
profess any other Religion then theirs. Nay, they would not eat of what a Christian or
Pagan had dress'd, unless it be Bread, Butter, Cheese, Preserves, or any thing of that kind.
They have a far greater aversion for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks then they have for the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
upon this account, that they cannot endure the worshipping of Images, nor the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of things visible.</p>
                  <p>They are for the most part of a good stature,<note place="margin">Their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and complexion.</note> and there are few hunch-back'd or lame
among them. They among them who are called <hi>Mogolies,</hi> are of a clearer Complexion
then the others, but they have all their Hair black, and without curling.</p>
                  <p>They love not flaxen or fair hair'd people, and have an aversion for such as are red hair'd,
out of an opinion they have, that they are Leprous. For that Disease is very common in
those parts; nay the more in this regard, that the Pox, which is no less common, is never
so well cured, but that it leaves some corruption in the bloud, which by insensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
infects the whole body, and, in time, degenerates into Leprosie. The <hi>Mollas</hi>
suffer their Beards to grow, but all the rest shave, not only their Beards, but also their
Heads, excepting only a little tuft, or lock, which they leave upon the Crown; upon
this perswasion, that by the said lock, <hi>Mahumet</hi> is to take them and lift them up to
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Both Men and Women are cloath'd much after the same manner.<note place="margin">Their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</note> Their Garments,
which are of Cotton, Silk, or Brocadoe, according to the several qualities of the persons,
are close above, like our close Coats, but from the waste downwards they grow wider and
wider, till they come to the small of the leg, where their breeches, which come down to
the feet, are gathered into many folds. Their Shooes are of <hi>Spanish</hi> Leather, or some
Silk-stuffe, or Brocadoe, the quarters very low, in regard they put them off ever and
anon, when they go into their Chambers, the Floors whereof are covered with Tapistry.
As to what they wear about their Heads, it is rather like that of the <hi>Turks</hi> then that of
the <hi>Persians,</hi> and is made of a very thin Stuff, of Cotton or Silk, and wrought with
Gold or Silver Thread. They call it <hi>Shees,</hi> and never put it off, but when they go to
bed. Upon their ordinary Garment, they wear a kind of Cloak, which they call <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they call <hi>Commerbant,</hi> which is made of a Silk-stuffe, wrought with Gold Thread, upon
which they have another, which is a larger, of a very fine Cotton. Persons of Quality
wear in their Girdles a kind of Armes or Ponyards, short and broad, which they call
<hi>Ginda,</hi> or <hi>Catarre,</hi> the handle and sheath whereof are of Gold, and many times set with
precious Stones.</p>
                  <p>The Houses of Persons of Quality are spacious enough,<note place="margin">Their Houses.</note> and consist of several Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments,
Halls, Chambers and Closets. The Roofs of their Houses are flat, so as that
a Man may go upon them, to take the fresh Air, and lye there in the night. There
is no House almost, but hath its Garden and <hi>Tanque;</hi> but their Buildings are poor,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47786:229"/>
for their Walls are but of Earth, plaistered over with a Composition, made of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
beaten small, Lime, Gum and Sugar, which makes a dazling white, and is
as smooth as Glass. Their Houses are but poorly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

it self, where you see only a few Dishes and Stoves: but the Women in
their own Lodgings take no small pride in setting out their Gold and Silver
Plate.</p>
                  <p>The Men receive their Visits in a Hall,<note place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their Visits.</note> where they sit on several pieces of Tapistry: At
their entrance into the Room they mutually salute one another with their <hi>Salom,</hi> which
they accompany with a low inclination; and if the Person whom they salute be of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
they put the right hand to their heads, to shew the power they are willing he should
have over them. When there is no submission due on either side, the Visitants think it
enough to salute one the other only with an inclination of the body, and sometimes they
take one another by the lock, saying <hi>Grab anemcas,</hi> that is, <hi>be it to you according to the
prayers of the poor.</hi> He who receives visits keeps his place, and causes those who come to
see him, to sit on both sides of him. They are very civil and very reserved in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
insomuch that they are never seen contesting or loud in their discourse, and never
use any gestures of either the hand or the head. When they would whisper to any one,
they cover their mouth with a Skarf or Napkin, lest their breath should offend the person
whom they speak to. They who make Visits about business, take leave as soon as they
have done; but intimate Friends continue their Visits, till the Master of the house be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to dinner.</p>
                  <p>They are very expensive in Cloaths,<note place="margin">Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</note> Feasting and Women; for their Law allowing
them to take all pleasures imaginable, provided they do not injure their Neighbours, they
are willing enough to make their advantage of that permission, and so pursue all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
their hearts can wish. When they eat, they sit upon Tapistry, and are served by a
Carver. They have no Napkin, nor need any, for they never touch the Meat with their
hands.</p>
                  <p>They keep as many Servants as they can maintain,<note place="margin">Their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks.</note> assigning every person his particular
Employment, wherein the others are so exact, that they who are appointed to do one thing,
will not do the least service for another. For a <hi>Selvidar,</hi> whose place it is to look to the
Horses, will not meddle with an Oxe, or do any thing about the Cart, because that is the
duty of the <hi>Belluwan.</hi> The <hi>Serriewan</hi> hath the oversight of the Camels, and the <hi>Mahout</hi>
that of the Elephants.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Frassy</hi> looks to the Tents and Tapistry; and the <hi>Santeles</hi> are Lacqueys. These
have a great Plume of Feathers on their Heads, and two little Bells upon their Breasts, and
will easily travel fifteen or sixteen Leagues a day. They are not kept in the House, but
have their Wages, on which they live, though it amounts not to above three or four <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias</hi>
a Moneth. But they have withall certain Vails, calied <hi>Testury;</hi> yet with all the
Advantages they can make of their services, it is as much as they can do to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</p>
                  <p>Their greatest expence is that which they are at about their Wives. For being permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have three or four, if they please, they are oblig'd to maintain them, with their Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs
and Slaves, according to their quality, by allowing them a certain sum monethly, as
also by finding them Cloaths, Pearls, and Houshold-stuffe. Their Polygamy hath this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
in it, that there is no Woman, but uses all Industry and Artifice imaginable to gain
her Husbands affection, and defeat her Rivals. All the caresses, all the kindnesses she can
think of, she makes use of to ingratiate her self.</p>
                  <p>There is no Drug eminent for its veneral Vertues, but she will find out some means or
other to give him, to excite him to Voluptuousness; and she thinks no complyance too
great, to purchase his more frequent enjoyments. They have also a great kindness for the
Eunuchs, in whose custody they are, to engage them to afford them more liberty in their
restraint, which they brook so ill, that in those parts a man would think Polygamy should
rather be permitted the Women then the Men.</p>
                  <p>But of all,<note place="margin">The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tradesmen.</note> Tradesmen are in the saddest condition, in as much as the Children cannot
be put to any other Trades then what their Fathers are of, and there is this incouvenience
withall, that a piece of work must pass through three or four hands before it be finished;
so that all they can do is to get five or six pence a day. They must accordingly fare very
poorly, their ordinary Diet being only <hi>Kitsery,</hi> which they make of Beans pounded, and
Rice, which they boyl together in water till the water be consumed. Then they put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a little Butter melted, and this is their Supper, for all day they eat only Rice and Wheat
in the grain.</p>
                  <p>Their Houses are low,<note place="margin">Their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> the Walls of Earth, and covered with green Turfs. They
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47786:229"/>
make no fire in their Houses; for having nothing that is combustible but Cow-dung, the
stink of that would be insupportable; whence it comes that they burn it before their
Doors. They also rub the walls with the same dung, out of an imagination, that it keeps
away Fleas and other Insects.</p>
                  <p>Merchants<note place="margin">Merchants.</note> are infinitely more happy then Tradesmen; but they also have this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
that as soon as they have gotten any wealth together, they are exposed to the envy
of the Grandees, who find out wayes to flecce them, as soon as they make any shew of it.
And whereas they cannot do it with Justice, they many times make use of such pretences
as cost those their lives who have acquired excessive riches.</p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of these parts may be said to profess the same Religion; but they
have among them certain Superstitions, and particular manners of life, whereby they are
distinguished into several Sects, though it may be also alledged, that they are to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
rather so many Nations, then different Sects. For when they are distinguished into <hi>Patans,
Moguls,</hi> or <hi>Mogollies,</hi> and <hi>Indosthans,</hi> who are subdivided into many other more considerable
Fractions, as <hi>Sayet, Seegh,</hi> and <hi>Leet,</hi> it must be confess'd, that if there be any difference in their
humours, and manner of life, they brought it out of the Countreys whence they came,
and that it is not to be attributed to their Religion. For it is certain that the <hi>Patans</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Patans.</note>
are those, who in the precedent Travels of the Embassadours, are called <hi>Padars,</hi> a sort
of self-conceited, insolent, cruel, and barbarous people. They sleight others, for no other

necessity.</p>

publick Buildings, called <hi>Sarai,</hi> built by some persons out of Charity, for the convenience
of Strangers and Travellers, who, were it not for those, would be forc'd to lie in the open
Air. These are the <hi>Caravanseras,</hi> which have only the four walls, and a covering over
head; so that to be accommodated therein, a Man must bring along with him what is not
to be had there.</p>
                  <p>In travelling through the Countrey, they make use of Camels, Mules, Horses and Oxen.
They have also a kind of Coaches, for two or three persons, which are drawn by Oxen,
whereto they are so accustomed, that they easily go ten or twelve leagues a day. The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

are close of all sides.</p>
                  <p>Persons of all quality make use also of Elephants, and are sometimes carried in <hi>Palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quines,</hi>
which are a kind of Litter or Sedans, carried by two men upon their Shoulders
with a bar. They bring up their Elephants with much care, and are at great charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them. They delight much in Hawking and Hunting. Their Greyhounds are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
less then ours, but they tame Tigers and Leopards, whereof they make use in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and these surprise their prey at a sudden leap, but they never pursue it.</p>
                  <p>They are particularly industrious at the catching of River-fowl, by means of the Skin
of a tame Duck, which being fill'd with Hay, they swim even with the Water, and drawing

Seed like that of Fenu-greek. It is sown in <hi>Iune,</hi> and cut in <hi>November,</hi> and <hi>December.</hi>
It is sown but once in three years, and the first year the leaves are cut off within a foot of
the ground. The stalks are taken away, and the leaves are set a drying in the Sun, and
that done, they are set a soaking, for four or five dayes, in a Stones<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

six or seven foot water, which is ever and anon stirred, till such time as the Water hath
suckt out the colour and vertue of the Herb. That done, they let out the Water into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Trough, where they suffer it to settle for one night. The next day, all the Water is
taken away, and what is left in the bottom of the Trough is strain'd through a course
Cloath, and is set a drying in the Sun. And this is the best <hi>Indico;</hi> but the Countrey peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
adulterate it, by mixing therewith a certain Earth of the same colour. And whereas
the goodness of this Drug is discovered by its lightness, they have the cunning to put a
little Oyl into it, to make it swim upon the water.</p>
                  <p>The second year, the stalk which was left the year before shoots forth other leaves, but

of the third year is not good, and consequently not sought after by forraign Merchants, but
is imploy'd by the Inhabitants of the Countrey in the dying of their Cloaths. The best

<hi>Agra,</hi> and they get it out of Land that hath lain long fallow. The blackest and fattest
ground yields most of it, though other Lands afford some, and it is made thus. They make
certain Trenches which they fill with their Saltpetrous Earth, and let into them small Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets,

dispose it into another Trench, where it grows thick, and then they boil it like Salt, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
scumming it, and then they put it into earthen pots, wherein the remainder of the
Dregs goes to the bottom; and when the Water begins to thicken, they take it out of
these pots, to set it a drying in the Sun, where it grows hard, and is reduc'd into that form

falls into the River <hi>Maseroor,</hi> which crosses the whole Province, and produces that
Drug, which grows in the bottom of the River, as Coral doth: The Inhabitants of <hi>Guzu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratta</hi>
call it <hi>Iankenckhar,</hi> and keep it in Pouches of Sheep-skin, which, for its better preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,

                     <note place="margin">Assa foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida.</note> which our Drugsters and Apotheciries call <hi>Assa foetida,</hi> comes for the most
part from <hi>Persia,</hi> but that which the Province of <hi>Vtrad</hi> produces in the <hi>Indies</hi> is the best,
and there is a great Traffick driven in it all over <hi>Indosthan.</hi> The Plant which produces it
is of two kinds; one grows like a Bush, and hath small leaves, like Rice, and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles
a Turnip-leaf, and its greenness is like that of Fig-tree leaves. It thrives best in
stony and dry places, and its Gum begins to come forth towards the latter end of Summer,
so that it must be gathered in Autumn. The traffick of it is so much the greater in those
parts, upon this account, that the <hi>Benjans</hi> of <hi>Guzuratta</hi> make use of it in all their Sawces,
and rub their Pots and drinking Vessels therewith, by which means they insensibly accustom
themselves to that strong Scent, which we in <hi>Europe</hi> are hardly able to endure.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Amphion, Offion,</hi> or <hi>Opium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Opium.</note> which is spent in <hi>Europe,</hi> comes from <hi>Aden,</hi> or <hi>Cayro;</hi> but
that which is sold in the <hi>Indies</hi> comes out of the Province of <hi>Gualor,</hi> in <hi>Indosthan,</hi> and is
nothing but the juyce which is got out of Poppy, by an incision made therein, when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to grow ripe. All the Eastern Nations are great Lovers of it, in so much that the
young people, who are not permitted the use of it, and the meaner sort, who are not able
to buy it, will boyl the Poppy it self, and eat of the broath which is made thereof. And
whereas the Poppy among them is called <hi>Pust,</hi> they thence call those <hi>Pusty,</hi> who make use
of that broath, instead of <hi>Opium.</hi> The <hi>Persians</hi> affirm, that they were the first who made
use of it, and that all other Nations did it in imitation of their Grandees, who took it, at
first, to provoke sleeping. They take every day a small pill of it, about the bigness of a
Pea; not so much in order to sleeping, as that it should work the same effect as Wine does,
which infuses courage and great hopes into those, who otherwise would not discover much
of either. The <hi>Caffees,</hi> or Messengers, who travel into the Country, take of it to hearten
themselves; but the <hi>Indians</hi> make use of it for the most part, that they may be the better
fitted for the enjoyments of Women. No doubt but it is a poyson, which kills, if a Man
do not accustom himself thereto by little and little; and when he hath so accustomed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he must continue the frequent use of it, or he dies, on the other side. It so weakens
their Brains who take it continually, that they run the hazard of losing the use of their
Reason, and the principal functions of their Understanding, and become in a manner stupid,
if they recover not themselves by the same Remedy.</p>

                  <p>There is but one kind of weight all over the Kingdom of <hi>Guzuratta,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Weights.</note> which they call

the Kingdom besides, as at <hi>Amadabath</hi> elsewhere, they have <hi>Ropias Chagam,</hi> which are

of certain Shells, which they call <hi>Kaurets,</hi> and are gathered on the Sea-side, eighty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

in regard they covert them into their own Coins with much advantage, by the change
they make either to weight or alloy, and many times as to both. They esteem the <hi>Larris</hi>
of <hi>Persia,</hi> the Silver whereof is very good. They have also a certain Coin of Gold, which
they call <hi>Xeraphins,</hi> and is worth about thirteen <hi>Ropias</hi> and a half; but there are very few
of them. The <hi>Chequines,</hi> and <hi>Ducats</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> are more common there, and are worth
eight and a half, and sometimes nine <hi>Ropias, Surat</hi> money, according to the change, and the
rate set on the money, which rises or falls according to the plenty or scarcity of money,
upon the place where it is paid.</p>
                  <p>There is abundance of counterfeit Money coin'd in the <hi>Indies,</hi>

there is no payment made, but it is done before these Changers, whom they call <hi>Xaraffes,</hi>
who have their Shops at the corners of the principal Streets, and for a small matter, secure
the goodness of the Money, which they are so well acquainted with, that they immediately
discover whether it be counterfeit or not.</p>
                  <p>Their ordinary way of accounting is by <hi>Lacs,</hi> each of which is worth a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

                  <p>There is not any person in the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Countrey, possess'd of any real Estate in Land.
But when Seed-time is coming on,<note place="margin">The <hi>Mogul</hi> is really possessed of the whole Country.</note> the Peasants apply themselves to the Governour, or
him who is next under the King in the several Provinces, and acquaint him how much
ground they intend to cultivate that year, upon condition to allow the King a third part,
nay sometimes half the profits, in so much that it often happens, that the Peasants hardly
get in the charges they had been at in the manuring of it. On the contrary, the <hi>Mogul</hi>
leaves all the Meadow-ground to be Common, and makes little or no advantage thereof;
whence it comes, that most Grounds lye fallow, and bring forth only Grass.</p>
                  <p>They sow in their Gardens all sorts of Pot-herbs,<note place="margin">The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</note> as Lettice, Succory, Sorrel, Parsley, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
Radishes, Navew, Cabbages, Cowcumbers, Citruls, Garlick, Onions, Parsnips of several
kinds; but above all, Melons, which in delicacy exceed those of all other parts. The
Rose only excepted, there is almost no Flower but is sought after more for its colour then
scent: for though those they call <hi>Mogera</hi> and <hi>ceampi</hi> have a good smell, yet are the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
more in love with them for their colour then scent. The former are white, the latter
yellow, and both are to be had all the year long, as also the Grass wherewith all the Fields
are covered, unless it be when the excessive heat of the Summer dries it up.</p>
                  <p>Besides the Trees known to us,<note place="margin">Trees.</note> and which bring forth Lemmons, Citrons of several
kinds, and Pomegranats; there are also those called <hi>Ananas, Banasses, Iaccas, Cocos,</hi> and
Fig-trees, of which they most cultivate the <hi>Cocos</hi>-trees, out of which they get the Terry.
There is also near <hi>Surat</hi> a kind of Grapes, but much less then those of <hi>Persia,</hi> and much
dearer then any other Fruit of the Countrey. We shall have occasion to speak of it else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and shall therefore only add here, that their Forrests, which are full of these sorts of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47786:231"/>
Trees, are stor'd, besides the Creatures we have spoken of heretofore, with a kind of wild
Dogs, which they call <hi>Iakals;</hi> but it is death for any to hurt them, or any of the other
Beasts, that are yellow or black, because that sport is reserv'd for the King, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Province.</p>
                  <p>Their Horses are not comparable to those of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Arabia;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> yet are they at great
charge in keeping them, allowing a Groom for every Horse, and feeding them after a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
manner. When they give them of that kind of Pease called <hi>Ciches,</hi> whereof we
spoke before, called by them <hi>Donna,</hi> they cause them to be beaten and boil'd. Besides
which, they give them, twice a day, morning and evening, two pounds of Barly-meal,
which they make up into a Paste with half a pound of Butter, and a pound of Sugar.</p>
                  <p>The Oxen of this Countrey are of the same making with ours,<note place="margin">Their Beef and Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> save that they have a
great bunch or rising between the Shoulders. The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> are the only people that
eat of them, as they do also of Mutton; but they are only the poorer sort that do so. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of quality feed on Kid, which they either roast whole, making a Pudding of Rice,
Almonds, and Raisins of the Sun, in the belly, or they stew them with Butter and Pepper,
which they call <hi>Brenghie,</hi> and is very good meat. They eat also of those <hi>Persian</hi> Sheep
that have such fat tails; but this is a very scarce dish, and consequently reserv'd for great
Mens Tables, and extraordinary Entertainments.</p>
                  <p>They have also Fowl,<note place="margin">Their Fowl.</note> as Capons, Peacocks, Geese, wild-Ducks, Teal, Partridges, Pigeons,

love Flesh better then Fish. They have also all sorts of Shell-fish, as Oysters and
Crabs, and particularly a certain Fish (which in the Maritime Towns of <hi>Picardy</hi> is called
<hi>Cheurette,</hi> and is a kind of great Prawn) so big, that a dozen of them makes a good dish.
It is very remarkable, that whereas, upon all the Coasts of <hi>Europe,</hi> this Fish is best at the
Full-moon, in those parts it is so at the New; and at the Full, Shell-fish are in a manner
empty. The Fish called <hi>Tubarons,</hi> which devour Men, are often seen in those parts, and
that is one reason why all persons ordinarily bathe and wash themselves in <hi>Tankes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their Ships are but poorly built,<note place="margin">Their Ships</note> in so much that they have no other way to dispose of
their Artillery but upon the deck, and consequently in the open Air. The greatest Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
they make are those of <hi>Iava</hi> and <hi>Sumatra,</hi> Eastward; and to <hi>Aden</hi> and <hi>Meca</hi> upon the
Red-sea. They sometimes carry above a thousand persons together, who for the most
part go upon Pilgrimage to <hi>Meca,</hi> that at their return they may be put into the number of
their <hi>Hoggoi,</hi> or Saints. They set sail at the beginning of the <hi>March-Moon,</hi> and return in
<hi>September,</hi> for the tempests, which reign from <hi>Iune</hi> till that time upon those Coasts, makes
them spend six moneths in a Voyage which might be performed in two.</p>
                  <p>The Commodities they transport to the Coasts of <hi>Aden,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Red-sea.</note> are Cotten, Linnen-cloath, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico,
Camphire, Tobacco, Allum, Sulphur, Benjamin, Pepper, and other Spices, Mirobalans,
and several other sorts of Preserves, and they bring back very little in Commodities, to
wit, Coral, Amber, <hi>Misseit,</hi> wherewith they dye red, <hi>Kahwa</hi> or <hi>Coffee</hi>-berries, and <hi>Opium,</hi>
which is accounted the best of all the East; but their best returns consist in Gold and
Silver coined.</p>
                  <p>The other Vessels,<note place="margin">To the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Gulf.</note> which are less, and go from <hi>Surat, Cambaia</hi> and <hi>Broitschia</hi> upon the

as Almonds, Raisms of the Sun, Nuts, and Dates, and above all Rose-water, wherewith
they drive a great Trade. These go away in the moneths of <hi>Ianuary</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> and
return in <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> There are other Ships of a hundred, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,

sorts of the Commodities of the Country,<note place="margin">To Achim,</note> and bring home Sulphur, Benjamin, Camphire,
Percelain, Tin and Pepper. These last set sail in <hi>May,</hi> for this reason, that the <hi>Portuguez,</hi>
who forbid the selling of Pepper any where but in the Cities where they have established
their Commerce, upon pain of death and confiscation of Goods, and guard the Coast against
the Pirats of the <hi>Malabares,</hi> draw not into their Havens till that time; and therefore they

                  <p>The City of <hi>Visiapour</hi> is of such largeness, that it is above five Leagues in compass. The

The Kings Palace is in the midst of the City, from which it is divided by a double Wall,
and two Ditches, being above 3500. paces in compass. He who commanded there in the
time of <hi>Sulthan Mamedh Idelshach,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> was called <hi>Nammouth-chan,</hi> by
Countrey an <hi>Italian,</hi> born at <hi>Rome.</hi> His command extended also over the City, and the
5000. men who kept Garrison therein, besides the 2000. who were the constant Garrison
of the Castle. The City hath five distinct Suburbs, where the principal Merchants have
their habitations, and particularly in that of <hi>Schanpour,</hi> where live most of the Jewellers.
The other Suburbs are called <hi>Gurapour, Ibrahimpour, Alapour</hi> and <hi>Bomnenaly.</hi> The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants

City of <hi>Berce</hi> are three Leagues, and thence to <hi>Mirsie</hi> three Leagues. This City, which
is called also <hi>Mirdsi,</hi> and <hi>Mirisgie,</hi> is large, but not very populous, having, on the North-side,
a Castle, so well fortifi'd, that the <hi>Mogul,</hi> who sometime besieg'd it with all the Forces of
his Kingdom, was forc'd to raise the Siege. In this place are also to be seen the Tombs of
two Kings of <hi>Delly,</hi> who were enterr'd there above five hundred years since. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the City, as also those of the Country thereabouts, have a great veneration for

Gates nor Walls, and all its Fortifications consists in two Batteries, on the Rive-side, upon
which there are four Iron Guns. The Wood, which lies on the left hand as you go into

a white Tower, which serves for a <hi>Pagode</hi> or <hi>Mosquey,</hi> and is an infallible direction to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots.
The entrance into the River is somewhat difficult, there being at the mouth of it a
Sand-bank, which at low-water is dry; so that as you go in, you must alwayes keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

six fathom water, unless it be at the very mouth of the River, where you have not above

in Salt, which is brought thither from <hi>Oranubammara,</hi> as also in Pepper. Heretofore there
were set forth thence several Vessels for the Gulf of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the Red-sea; but now
their Commerce that way is so inconsiderable, that they hardly send out three or four
wretched bottoms for <hi>Gamron.</hi> The Custom paid there is three and a half upon the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;

is an abomination to them. As to their manner of life, their Marriages, Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Purifications and other Ceremonies, they imitate therein the <hi>Benjans</hi> of <hi>Guzuratta.</hi>
Their Houses are of Straw, and the Doors so low, that a Man cannot get in without stoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
All that's to be seen within them is only a Mat, on which they lie in the night, and
a pit in the ground, wherein they beat their Rice. Their habit is the same with that of
the other <hi>Benjans,</hi> save that their Shooes, which they call <hi>Alparcas,</hi> are of wood, ty'd up
over the Instep with straps of Leather. Their Children go naked till they come to seven
or eight years of age, and they are for the most part by profession Gold-smiths: There
are also among them some who work in Brass: they have Physitians, Barbers, Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Carpenters and Masons, who work for the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> the other <hi>Benjans,</hi> and the

of that of the people, which he had made it his main business to acquire, during the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
by a liberality truly Royal, made no reflection on these Remonstrances, till he found
some of the great Ones, with an Army of thirty thousand men at the City Gates. Being

while the Army was not yet come within five Leagues of the City, and being come to
the door of the Kings Lodgings, the Guards having made no difficulty to let him pass, and
finding it lock'd, contrary to the custom, he would have forc'd it: but the King awaken'd
at the noise, asked who was there. He made answer that it was he, and that he had some
Letters of great consequence to communicate to him, which he had just then received
from some of the chief Commanders of his Army. The King made answer, that it was
an unseasonable time of the night for the reading of Letters, and bid him come again the
next morning, and thereupon immediately getting up, he went to the <hi>Mahael,</hi> or Queens
Lodgings, to whom he gave an account of the presumptuous demeanour of <hi>Chauas-chan,</hi>
in coming to his Chamber door ar such an hour. The Queen, who was a Woman of a

they should, with the soonest, make away that pernicious Minister. They employ'd to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

much precipitation, that, not staying to see what effect the Wound he had given him would
have, he went presently along with the King into the Womens Lodgings. Another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who was present at the blow, perceiving the Wound was not mortal, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a kindness to <hi>Chauas,</hi> run immediately to him, embrac'd him, ask'd him what might be
the occasion of his disgrace, and making as if he would have taken the Ponyard out of the
Wound, wherein it still stuck, thrust it so much the further in, that he fell to the ground.
The Eunuch, who was with him, got him convey'd to his own house. But the Queen
having notice of what had past, as also of the disorder, wherein the King and the <hi>Meldar</hi>
had drawn off, commanded <hi>Chideram</hi> to go and make an end of him. <hi>Chauas-Chan</hi> seeing
<hi>Chideram</hi> coming into his Chamber, and imagining he came out of civility to give him a
visit, said to him; <hi>Wo is me,</hi> Chideram, <hi>who is it that hath thus murthered me?</hi> But <hi>Chide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi>

Captains, friends of <hi>Chauas,</hi> and some other of his Kindred who were present, yet they
not only made not the least opposition, but suffered themselves to be all tamely kill'd, not
one profferring to avoid that fatal destiny.</p>

Masters death, run immediately to the Castle, with an intention to dispatch the King; but
he met by the way with about thirty Souldiers, who stop'd him. He made a shift to kill
ten of them with his own hands, and had dispatch'd the rest, had he not been over-power'd
by number, which increas'd as the noise of the attempt spread more and more into the
City. They cat off his head, and hung it up as a Trophey, upon one of the Towers of the

                  <p>The only Action that had eclips'd the Ministry of <hi>Chauas-chan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chauas's</hi> ingratitude towards his Benefactor.</note> was the disgrace of
<hi>Mustafa-chan.</hi> This <hi>Mustafa</hi> was he, who of all the Lords about the Court, was most in
credit with <hi>Ibrahim Schach,</hi> as being the person upon whom he had cast his eye for the
Guardianship of the Prince his Son. But he, unwilling to accept of it, excus'd himself,
and recommended the merit of <hi>Chauas-chan,</hi> who requited him with the greatest ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
that ever was heard of. <hi>Chauas</hi> would needs have that Lord to countenance by his
Authority whatever had been done during the time of the Regency, and finding it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to corrupt him, he resolved to dispatch him out of the way, by perswading the King,
that the honest old Man had some design upon his life. The young Prince implicitely
crediting what was told him by his Favourite, resolved to secure his person, which oblig'd
<hi>Mustafa-chan,</hi> who had notice thereof, to stand upon his guard, and to fortifie himself in his
house, having about him 700. Horse, and 2000. Foot. The place was regularly besieg'd
with ten Guns; and after he had held out six dayes, he was forc'd to render it and himself
up at mercy; for most of his people, nay his very menial servants fell off from him. <hi>Idal-Schach</hi>
hearing that <hi>Chauas-chan</hi> intended either to put <hi>Mustafa-chan</hi> to death, or at least
to have his eyes out, prevented both, by representing to him, that the <hi>Mogul,</hi> to whom he
was ally'd, would concern himself in the Fortunes of <hi>Mustafa-chan;</hi> and upon these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
he was sent prisoner to the Castle of <hi>Bellagam-Chapour,</hi> being allow'd of all his
vast Revenues, but five <hi>Pagodes</hi> to live upon.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly the <hi>Mogul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Mogul</hi> concerns himself in <hi>Mustafa</hi>'s Fortunes.</note> 
                     <hi>Schach-Iahan</hi> had no sooner intelligence brought him of the
disgrace of <hi>Mustafa-chan,</hi> but he sent an Envoy to <hi>Idal-Schach,</hi> to require, that he might
be set at liberty, and put into possession of all his estate, or that he should be oblig'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
a War against him. <hi>Idal-Schach</hi> promis'd to do both, but <hi>Chaurs-chan</hi> eluded the
performance of that promise, so that <hi>Mustafa</hi> got not out of prison, till after <hi>Chauas</hi> his
death: upon which, he was restored to his former dignity, enjoying near ten millions of
<hi>Pagodes</hi> of yearly revenue. He kept ordinarily a thousand Domesticks, and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse at his own charge abroad, besides those he maintained at his own Palace. <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deram-chan,</hi>
who had been very instrumental in the death of <hi>Chauas-chan,</hi> was next in
credit to <hi>Mustafa;</hi> and next to him, <hi>Agu-rasa,</hi> who was Governour General of the Castles
of <hi>Ponda, Perinda, Salpour</hi> and <hi>Bellegam-chapour.</hi> He was one of <hi>Chauas-chan</hi>'s Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
whence it came, that upon the death of his Patron, he was not so much in favour
as he had been, but was continu'd in his employments, though he desir'd to be disburthen'd
of the care of publick Affairs by reason of his age.</p>
                  <p>They say,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Decam</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to raise 200000. men.</note> the King of <hi>Cuncam</hi> is able in a short time to raise two hundred thousand
Men; yet, as we said before, he is a Tributary to the <hi>Mogul. Adelham-Schach,</hi> great
Grand-father of <hi>Idal-Schach,</hi> in the year 1586. took the City of <hi>Goa</hi> twice from the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez:</hi>
but considering at last, that War destroyed his Countrey, he treated with them,
and by the Treaty concluded between them, he lest them the Countrey of <hi>Salsette,</hi> with
67. Villages, that of <hi>Bardes,</hi> with 12. and that of <hi>Tisuary</hi> with 30. Villages, provided that
the Inhabitants of <hi>Cuncam</hi> should enjoy freedom of Commerce all over the <hi>Indies;</hi> yet
with this further proviso, that they should be oblig'd to sell all their Pepper to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of <hi>Goa,</hi> who had made a general Treaty to that purpose, upon pain of Confiscation.
But this Treaty hath not been so well observed, but that there were, on both sides, from
time to time great dissatisfactions, which by an unhappy accident broke forth into some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Hostility in the year 1635. For, upon intelligence brought to the <hi>Portuguez,</hi>
that four of the Kings Ships, bound for <hi>Meca,</hi> and some parts of <hi>Persia,</hi> were partly loaden
with Pepper, they sent four Frigots to Sea after them, which set upon the Kings Ships,
and after a vigorous resistance, wherein a <hi>Portuguez</hi> Captain was kill'd, took them, and
having brought them to <hi>Goa,</hi> kill'd in cold bloud all the <hi>Indians</hi> that were aboard; so that
it was not questioned, but that the King of <hi>Cuncam</hi> would declare War against the City
of <hi>Goa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is not any Prince in all those parts so well stor'd with Artillery as the King of
<hi>Cuncam.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery.</note> Among others, he had one Brass piece, which requir'd a Bullet weighing eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
weight, with five hundred and forty pound of fine Powder; which did such executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as was reported, that at the siege of the Castle of <hi>Salapour,</hi> at the first firing, it made a
breach in the wall of forty five foot in length. The Caster of it was a <hi>Roman</hi> born, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47786:236"/>
the most wicked of mankind; since he had the inhumanity in cold bloud, to kill his
own Son, to consecrate that monstrous Piece with his bloud, and to cast into the Fire,
wherein he had melted his Metal, one of the Kings Treasures, who would call him
to account for the charge he had been at therein. But it is time we prosecute our
Voyage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ian.</hi> 7. We came betimes in the morning before the City of <hi>Bacim.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bacim.</note> Being come near
the City, the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Governour gave us seven Pieces, and we answer'd his civility with
three. We stay'd there above four hours expecting a <hi>Portuguez</hi> Jesuit, whom we had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to carry to <hi>Goa;</hi> but finding he came not within the time he had promised, we kept
on our course. Being got about a League thence, we perceiv'd coming out of the Port a
<hi>Portuguez</hi> Frigot, which, as we imagin'd, came to bring the Jesuit aboard us; whereupon
we struck some of our sail, to expect it: but the Captain told us, that it was the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
desire to the President, that that Frigot might go to <hi>Goa</hi> under the <hi>English</hi> Colours,
as fearing to meet some of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who incessantly rove up and down that Coast. He
brought us, as a Present from the Governour, three Oxen, some Sheep, Bread, several Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
of Citrons and Oranges, and divers other refreshments, wherewith we merrily pursu'd
our Voyage.</p>
                  <p>Wednesday, <hi>Ian.</hi> 9. with a good North-wind, we pass'd by the Isles of <hi>Bandera</hi>
and <hi>Bambay,</hi> which reach all along the Coast, from <hi>Bacim,</hi> as far as <hi>Rasiapour.</hi> That
of <hi>Bambay</hi> is of a considerable bigness, and hath a very good Haven towards the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ian.</hi> 10. We pass'd in sight of <hi>Rasiapour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rasiapour.</note> which is but 21. Leagues from <hi>Goa.</hi> In the
afternoon we pass'd by the City of <hi>Fingerla,</hi> within four Leagues of <hi>Goa,</hi> where the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
have a Factory; and in the evening we discover'd the Isles about <hi>Goa,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the two Castles which secure the entrance of that noble City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ian.</hi> 11. We cast Anchor under the Castle <hi>Deguard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Come to <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </note> about a quarter of a League from
the City. We found in the Haven six Gallions and a Carrack, whom we saluted with our
great Guns. The <hi>Mary</hi> fir'd twenty five, the other nine, and the third five. The General
of the Gallions gave us a volley of his greatest pieces. The Castle fir'd three; we, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
thereto, five; the other two, eight between them. Immediately after, came aboard
us a <hi>Portuguez</hi> Captain to complement the President from the Viceroy. Not long after,
came the General of the Gallions aboard us in person, in a Gondole gilt and cover'd with
Scarlet. At his coming into the Ship there were twenty Guns fired. After the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements,
he intreated the President to go along with him in his Gondole to the Gallion, to
refresh himself for some hours: But the President excus'd himself, in regard he was then
going to the City, and promis'd, at his return, to give him a visit aboard. The Gallions
were there only to keep the Haven against the twelve <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, which pretended to
block up the City of <hi>Goa</hi> towards the Sea. At our coming thither, they were got off at
some distance, to recover themselves after an Engagement, wherein they had lost two of
their Ships, some few dayes before, which were burnt by the Fire-ships: but the next day
they came up again, and cast Anchor in the Road, to hinder the Carrack from getting out,
while the Frigots and little Vessels, which could go along the Coast, brought thither all
sorts of Provisions and Commodities, so freely, that, one day, I saw coming in a <hi>Caravan</hi> of
above three hundred Boats, loaden with Pepper, Ginger, <hi>Cardamomum,</hi> Sugar, Rice, Fruits,
and Conserves.</p>
                  <p>The President, who as he went up the River had his Trumpets sounding before him,
went strait to the house of the <hi>Fiador de la fasende,</hi> who is as it were the Overseer of the
Exchequer, it being with him chiefly, that he was to negotiate the business, which had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
his calling at <hi>Goa.</hi> The <hi>Fiador</hi> was sick in bed, yet did he receive the President
with all civility, and promis'd to do him all the good offices he could expect, from the
friendship they had long before contracted together. Thence the President was carried in
a <hi>Palanquin</hi> to the Lodgings which were assign'd him:<note place="margin">The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent visits the Viceroy.</note> whither as soon as he was come, he
sent to demand audience of the Viceroy, which was immediately granted him. The Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy's
Palace lies upon the River, so that we went thither by boat. We found upon the
River-side, many <hi>Hidalgos,</hi> or Gentlemen, of the Viceroy's retinue, who conducted us into
the Hall, where he was to give the President audience. The Guards, who were all clad-in
the same livery, had taken their Armes, and stood in two files in the Anti-chamber, through
which there was an entrance into the Hall, which was richly furnish'd, and full of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of several Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi> The Viceroy, who was all in black, as were also all
his Courtiers, rose out of his Chair at the Presidents coming in, and sate not down again
till the other was set. All the rest of the Company stood before the Viceroy, some only
of the Gentlemen excepted, who carried us into one of the cross Rooms to entertain us.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47786:236"/>
The President, having dispatched his business, took leave of the Viceroy, who brought him
to the Hall door, where he stood bare, till we were all got out. The same Gentlemen, who
had receiv'd us at our coming out of the Boat, broughtus back to the River, shewing us,
as we came a long, twelve excellent Horses, sumptuously cover'd and harness'd, which had
been purposely brought thither, that we might take notice of the Viceroy's magnificence.
We saw there also a <hi>Biggel,</hi> which is a Creature about the bigness, and much of the same
colour as a <hi>Renne,</hi> but is headed like a Horse, main'd like an Ass, having black and cloven
feet, and upon his head two black horns.</p>
                  <p>We had hardly dined, at our return to our Lodging, ere we were tir'd with Visitants.
Most of the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Lords came to salute the President; and there was no Monastery
but sent its Deputies to complement him. The ten dayes we stay'd at <hi>Goa</hi> were spent
in reciprocal Visits and continual feasting. One of the noblest Entertainments we had,
was that which was made us the 15. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> by a <hi>Portuguez</hi> Lord, who had been Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Bacim,</hi> and was then newly come to the government of <hi>Mozambique.</hi> Every
course consisted only of four dishes of Meat, but they were so often chang'd, and the Meat
so excellently well dress'd, that I may truly say, I never was at the like. For with the
Meat there was brought such variety of excellent Fruits, that by the continual change and
intermixture of both, the appetite was sharpened and renew'd. But what was most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
was, that though the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Ladies are as seldom seen as those of the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
and <hi>Persians,</hi> yet this Lord, knowing he could not any way more oblige the <hi>English,</hi>
then by allowing them the sight of Women, we were serv'd at Table by four handsom
young Maids of <hi>Malacca,</hi> while he himself was attended by two Pages and an Eunuch. These
Maids brought in the Meat, and fill'd our Wine; and though he himself drunk not any,
yet would he have the <hi>English</hi> treated after their own way, and drink to what height
they pleas'd. Being risen from Table, he brought us into a spacious Chamber, where he
again press'd us to drink; and when the President was to take leave of him, he presented
him with a noble Coverlet of <hi>Watte,</hi> a quilted Covering for a Horse, a fair Table, and a rich
Cabinet of <hi>Lacque.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day,<note place="margin">The <hi>Jesuits</hi> of <hi>Goa</hi> treat him.</note> being the 16. we dined at the Profess'd House of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> who had
invited us to a sumptuous Feast. There were in this House a hundred and fifty Fathers,
and at least as many Scholars or Students, yet did not that great number near fill that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Structure, which was four stories high, and had the pleasantest prospect in the World,
as well towards the Sea, as on the Land side. They first shew'd us all the conveniences of
the House, their Wealth, and the order they observ'd in their Oeconomy. Then they
brought us into a fair arched Hall, as big as an ordinary Church, which was beset with Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
placed all along the Walls. The Cloath was laid, with the Trenchers, the drinking
Cups, and Earthen pots, and they had brought in Bread and Fruit. In the midst of the
Hall, there was another little square Table, cover'd and furnish'd as the rest; for those who
were to do pennance for their having done any thing contrary to the discipline of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
In the midst of the Entry to this Hall, there was a Pillar, out of which issued a Spout
of water for the washing of their hands. Then they carried us up to the third story, to
another Hall, which was not as large as that below, but so richly furnish'd, as might become
the Appartment of a very noble House, as well in point of Tapistry as other things. The
Table prepared for us was very large, and plac'd in the midst of the Hall, cover'd with a
noble Cloath, beset with Fruit, and Bread, and <hi>China</hi> dishes, which Persons of Quality in
those parts do prefer before those of Silver.</p>
                  <p>The Father Provincial,<note place="margin">A feast at the profess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed house of the <hi>Jesuits.</hi>
                     </note> having given the President the precedence, sate down by him,
and afterward ordered all our company to be so plac'd, as that, between every two, there
were two <hi>Iesuits</hi> to entertain and discourse with us; the rest standing behind to wait on
us. The Meat was brought in little dishes of Porcelain, to every man his own dish; and
this for several courses, both of Flesh and Fish, all excellently well dress'd. The desert was
suitable to the rest of the entertainment, and consisted in Tarts, Florentines, Eggs drest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Portuguez</hi> way, admirably well perfum'd, Marchpains, and Conserves, both dry and
liquid.</p>
                  <p>At our rising from Table, they conducted us into several Chambers, where they left us,
to take the ordinary repose, during the greatest heat of the day. There was in every
Chamber three Beds, and in the midst upon a Table a great Vessel of Porcelane, full of fair
Water. Then they came and carried us into a Hall, where we were to have the divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Ball, which was danc'd by the Children of certain <hi>Indians,</hi> whom they had bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
and instructed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion. The Arch-bishop of <hi>Goa,</hi> who
was Primate of all the <hi>Indies,</hi> was there also in person, as well to participate of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisment,
as to entertain the President, by order from the Viceroy. The Dancing-master
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47786:237"/>
made the first entrance alone, and did pretty well for a <hi>Portuguez:</hi> The Habits of the
Dancers were very rich, but they had no Visards on, nor any thing upon their Heads, but
a Crown of Flowers. The noblest entrance, and that which discover'd the subject of
the Ball, was that of fifteen persons who came in, bringing along with them, some pieces
of a broken Pillar, some Garlands of divers Flowers, wherewith they adorn'd the Pillar
after they had, after several turnings, absolutely set it together, all performed with obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the Musick. At the upper end of this Pillar came out a Flower, made like a
Tulip, which opened of it self, while they danc'd, till at last there came out of it an Image
of the blessed Virgin, with her Child in her arms, and the Pillar it self opened in several
places, to cast out perfum'd Waters like a Fountain. After they had danc'd a while, they took
the Pillar asunder, after the same manner as they had put it together, and went out of the
Room in very good order. The <hi>Iesuits</hi> told us, that by that invention they represented
the pains they had taken, in planting among the <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of those parts, the
Church of God, whereof our Saviour is the only Pillar or Corner-stone. After this there
was an entrance of twelve Youths, who sung and play'd every one upon a different Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
all done in exact measure. There came in also some <hi>Morris-dancers,</hi> who danc'd to the
<hi>Castagnets,</hi> and kept measure with the Musick so exactly, that I never saw any thing like it.
There came in also one Man alone, who was covered with Birds-nests, and cloath'd and
mask'd according to the <hi>Spanish</hi> mode, who began the <hi>farce</hi> of this Comedy, by ridiculous
and fantastick postures, and the Ball was concluded with the coming in of twelve Boys,
dress'd like Apes, which they imitated in their cries and postures. The Ball being over,
we staid there a while to hear their Musick, which was altogether after the <hi>Portuguez</hi> way.
As we took leave of our Entertainers, they told us, that they made use of those Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as well to reduce the <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> of those parts to the embracing of
<hi>Christian</hi> Religion, by that kind of modern Devotion, as to amuse the Children, and divert
them after their studies.</p>
                  <p>The 18. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Another Feast at the <hi>Jesuits</hi> Colledge.</note> we were invited to dinner by the <hi>Iesuits</hi> of the Colledge, which
they call the <hi>Bon-Iesus.</hi> We were receiv'd at the entrance by some of the most ancient
Fathers, who shewed us in several Halls and Chambers the Pictures of several Princes and
Persons of Quality, who had been of their Order; as also the Histories of those of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
who had suffer'd Martyrdom for <hi>Christian</hi> Religion; among whom the Authors of
the Gun-powder plot in <hi>England</hi> were not the least. But they forbore giving us the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
thereof; only they entertain'd us with a long relation of the cruelties, exercis'd
some years before, upon those of their Society in <hi>Iapan,</hi> where the Emperour had made use
of the most exquisite torments could be invented, upon the <hi>Christians,</hi> as well the Forreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who had spent their endeavours in planting Religion in those parts, as upon the <hi>Iapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi>
who had made profession thereof.</p>
                  <p>Having shew'd us whatever was worth the seeing in their Colledge, they brought us
unto the Church, which is no question one of the most sumptuous the <hi>Iesuits</hi> have in all
<hi>Asia.</hi> The Structure is vast and magnificent, and the Ornaments are so sutable to the
greatness thereof, that it were not easie to imagine any thing more noble. The first thing
we were shewed was the High-Altar; but though it were one of the noblest I ever saw,
yet came it not, in wealth, near another lesser one, which had been built in honour of
Saint <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> whom they call the <hi>Apostle of the Indies.</hi> We were shewed his
Image, which was upon wood, drawn according to the life, and we were told his body
was still to be seen in that Church, in the same posture as it was at the time of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iesuits</hi> told us, that the body of the said Saint <hi>Francis Xavier</hi> was found in the
Island of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and that it was discovered only by a most delightful smell, which had
brought those who found it many Leagues distance from the Sea, to the place where it was
hidden. Which story does not agree very well with what others write of the same bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
For besides, that the scent which is carried from the Island of <hi>Ceylon</hi> so far into the
Sea, proceeds from the Gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <note place="margin">The Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chro of <hi>Francis Xavier.</hi>
                     </note> one of the gravest Authors that ever were of the Society, sayes in express terms,
that <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> not satisfied with the progress he had made in the <hi>Indies</hi> by the
means of his preaching the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> would needs try whether it might have the
like success in <hi>China:</hi> but that he died on the Sea-side, as soon as he landed. Whereto
he adds, that the Master of the Ship, which had carried him thither, caused the Corps
to be put into unslak'd Lime, to the end he might carry away the bones, after the flesh
had been consumed; but that after certain dayes, that consuming matter had not
made any impression upon it, and that the body, instead of being corrupted, smell'd very
sweetly; and that thereupon they resolv'd to carry it to <hi>Goa,</hi> where it was received
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47786:237"/>
with great Ceremonies. They related to us a great many Miracles wrought by that Saint;
but I remember only two or three of the most considerable; to wit, that he had caused the
Sun to come back an hour after it was set; that he commanded the Sea and the Winds
with the same power, as our Saviour had sometimes done; and that he had rais'd up two
Men, one whereof had been buried a whole day before.</p>
                  <p>Out of the Church they brought us into their Refectory, where the Tables were
placed all along the walls, as we had seen them in the Professed House, and in so great a
number, that there was room enough for two hundred persons. Yet were there only four
of the chiefest among them that dined with us, while all the rest stood and waited on us.
We were as well treated by these as we had been by the others: but I must confess these
gave us the best Canary that ever I drunk. Of all the Moral Vertues, there is not any the
<hi>Iesuits</hi> endeavour more to practise then Sobriety, in so much that Drunkenness is a Vice
they can the least of any be charged withall; and yet at this time they often call'd to
drink, I conceive, purposely to engage us, to make it appear that it was not out of pure
Complement we commended their Wine. After dinner, they carried us up into the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whence we could take a view of all the City, the Sea, the River, and all the adjacent
Champion, as far as the Mountain, much better then we could have done from the fourth
Story of the Professed House.</p>

                     </note> they promised to send two of their Fathers to our Lodgings
the next morning, who should shew us the great Hospital, whereof the <hi>Iesuits</hi> have the
oversight. It is a very noble Structure, consisting of Chambers, Halls and Galleries, able
to lodge above a thousand sick persons, who are very carefully supplyed with all things.
Every Bed is mark'd with a certain Figure; and those which are not taken up, are known
by their mark, which is standing upright; whereas those which are, have the mark in some
other posture. The noblest Appartments of the Hospital were the Kitchin and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
shop belonging to it, both well furnished with all things necessary for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
of the sick, whereof there were a very great number; but most of the Pox, or
Bloudy-flux. Those who are to look after them have this foresight, that they would not
have the sick to be disheartened by seeing others dye; for as soon as they perceive the sick
party so far spent as that there is no way but death for him, he is carried to a private room,
whither a Priest is sent to him, who stirs not thence till he be dead.</p>
                  <p>Having view'd the Hospital,<note place="margin">The Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the <hi>Augustines</hi>
                     </note> we went to see the Monastery of the <hi>Augustines,</hi> which
they call the Convent of our <hi>Lady of Grace.</hi> It is seated upon a little eminency, so that,
seeing it at a certain distance, a man would take it for one of the noblest Palaces in the
World. The Friers carried us all about it, and shewed us particularly the rich Copes and
other Priests Vestments, which they said were given them by Persons of Quality, who had
spent some time among them. I deliver'd them the Letters of recommendation, which
the <hi>Augustines</hi> at <hi>Ispahan</hi> had given me, directed to them: whence it came that their civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
towards me were extraordinary. They proffer'd to shew me what was most remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
about the City; but in regard I had already seen as much as I desir'd, I thank'd them,
and came away with the rest of the company.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the President had dispatch'd his business with the Viceroy, who paid him
nine thousand pounds sterling, in ready Money, and promis'd him the rest should be paid,
either in Money, or Commodities, to those <hi>English</hi> Merchants, whom, to that purpose, he
had brought from <hi>Surat,</hi> he return'd their civilities, of whom he had received any, and
took leave of all.<note place="margin">The Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to the President.</note> The Viceroy, the General of the Gallions, and all the principal Lords
about the Court, sent him very considerable Presents. The former presented him with
several Skins of Cinnamon, a <hi>Biggel,</hi> some Butts of Sack, Sheep, and certain Baskets of
Fruit, and other refreshments. The <hi>Iesuits</hi> sent him <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and good store of all
sorts of Conserves, dry and liquid, with an intreaty, that he would take along with him,
for <hi>England,</hi> certain <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and among the rest, one who had liv'd long enough in <hi>China</hi>
to be throughly acquainted with the Country. Of all the Presents that were sent him,
what the President esteemed most, was a Bottle of Oyl, which had been extracted out of
the Flower of Cinnamon, and a Candle made of the Oyl extracted out of Cinnamon it
self.</p>

loaden with all sorts of Provisions and Commodities, which came from <hi>Cananor,</hi> and the
Coasts of <hi>Malabar,</hi> and had passed, notwithstanding the Block-house of <hi>Dutch</hi> Vessels,
which could only hinder the Gallions and Carracks from getting thence, to go for <hi>Portugal,</hi>
or towards the <hi>Moluccas.</hi> As soon as we were got out of the River, we made strait to
the Generals Gallion, which was called the <hi>Bon-Iesus,</hi> and carried sixty four Brass Guns, all
Cannons or Culverings. There were aboard her six hundred Men, Mariners and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47786:238"/>
and it was one of the noblest Vessels I ever saw. The General receiv'd the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
with much civility, and brought him into his Chamber, in and about which were an
Anti-chamber, a Closet, and two Galleries: and after a Collation of Conserves and Sack,
contrary to the custom of the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> who never proffer a Man drink, unless he ask for
it, he shew'd us all the Ship, which had the name of a Gallion, but might very well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a Carrack by reason of the bigness of it. The other Vessels of the Fleet were
also very noble ones, there being not any one among them, that had not fifty Guns at least.
The General and President were in private discourse, for about half an hour, after which
the President took his leave, and the General conducted him to a door which was in the
Stern of the Ship, at which it was more commodious getting out, then it is in other Ships
by Ladders of Ropes. As soon as the President was got into the Boat, all the <hi>Portuguez</hi>
Fleet fir'd their Guns. The Governour of the Castle <hi>de Guarde,</hi> having saluted the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,
who was his intimate Friend, with all the Guns he had, presented himself
upon the Battery, put off his Hat, and took leave of us. The President being come
aboard, ordered twenty Guns to be fired, which the General answered with twenty
others; whereupon we went into the Road, and lay between the <hi>Portuguez</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
Fleets.</p>
                  <p>But,<note place="margin">Goa <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</hi>
                     </note> ere we leave <hi>Goa,</hi> it will not be amiss, to give yet a little further account of what
we found most remarkable in that City, which no doubt is one of the noblest and greatest
of those the <hi>Portuguez</hi> are Masters of in any part of the <hi>Indies.</hi> It lies in the Kingdom
of <hi>Cuncam,</hi> or <hi>Decam,</hi> fifteen Degrees on this side the Line, in an Island, which the River
divides from the Continent. <hi>Alfonso Albuquerque</hi> took it by Composition, on the 16. of
<hi>February,</hi> 1510. from <hi>Zabaim Dalcam,</hi> Prince of <hi>Goa,</hi> who recovered it again from him
on the 30th of <hi>May</hi> following; but on the 21. of <hi>November</hi> in the same year, <hi>Albuquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi>
receiving fresh Forces irom a Fleet, which <hi>Diego Mendez Vaseoncelos</hi> had then newly
brought from <hi>Portugal,</hi> set upon the City and took it by storm. The City of <hi>Goa</hi> was,
even at that time, very considerable for its Traffick, but much less then it is now, as may be
seen by the Walls of the old City, which are yet standing, though the Gates be down, in
so much that there is nothing between it and the new City, built by the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> since
they established their main Trade there. It hath on the South-side the Island of <hi>Salsette,</hi>
which is divided from the Continent only by a small Rivulet, as is also the Island of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
which lies on the North-side, and under which Ships may cast Anchor with all safety,
without fear of any Winds. The Castle <hi>de Guarde</hi> lies at the foot of a Rock, on which
they have built a Tower, in form of a Redoubt, wherein, in the night time they make a
Fire, for a direction to Ships, and it hath several Brass pieces placed even with the Water.
From the mouth of the River to the Haven are about two Leagues, but it is equally
broad all along, even at the place where it runs between the Island and the Continent,
though in some places it be so shallow, that in Summer time there is not above two foot
water.</p>
                  <p>The Island of <hi>Goa</hi> does not produce any thing, and is so barren, that some few Lambs
and Goats excepted, it is not able to sustain any thing; and yet the <hi>Portuguez</hi> have some
Gardens there, and in them some Fruit, but it is to be attributed rather to their industry,
then to Nature. Palm-wine is there in abundance, and all other provisions are brought
thither from the two forementioned Islands, or from the Continent, so plentifully, that
they are so cheap there, that notwithstanding the Block-house of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> a Hog
might be had for a Crown, six sucking Pigs, ten Pullets, or eight wild Ducks, for as much;
but there are very few Oxen there, then which Sheep are yet more scarce. They permit
not the <hi>Indians</hi> to go over into the Continent, without leave obtain'd from those who
keep the passages, who make a mark in their Armes, which they are oblig'd to shew as they
come back: for the <hi>Portuguez</hi> would not have the <hi>Decanines</hi> and <hi>Canarines</hi> come into
the City without a Pass-port. All the fresh-water they have within the City comes
from a Fountain, which represents a <hi>Lucrece,</hi> out of whose Wound there comes Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enough to supply the whole City: but the Ships take in fresh-water near the Castle,
above which there comes out of the Rock a Rivulet, which there falls into the
River.</p>
                  <p>The City hath now neither Gates nor Walls,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Goa</hi> hath no w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

secures it against the attempts, which an open place might be exposed to. The publick
Buildings are very fair, and the Palaces of great Persons very magnificent, especially in
their Houshold-stuffe.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants are either <hi>Castizes,</hi> that is, <hi>Portuguez,</hi> born of Father and Mother <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez;</hi>

or <hi>Most zes,</hi> that is, born of a <hi>Portuguez</hi> Father, and <hi>Indian</hi> Mother. The <hi>Mesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes</hi>
are distinguished from the others by their colour, which inclines towards the Olive;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47786:238"/>
but those of the third Generation are as black as the Inhabitants of the Country; which
happens also in the fourth Generation of the <hi>Castizes,</hi> though there were no mixture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. The <hi>Portuguez</hi> are either <hi>Titulados,</hi> as those who are employed in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
charges; <hi>Fidalgos da casa del Rey,</hi> that is, Gentlemen in ordinary of the Kings
House; <hi>Mocos Fidalgos,</hi> young Gentlemen, that is, the Sons of <hi>Titulados,</hi> or <hi>Cavalleros,</hi> or
newly admitted to Gentility by the King, <hi>Cavalleros Fidalgos, Escuderes Fidalgos,</hi> or
simply Gentlemen. There are also such as have the quality of <hi>Mocos da camra,</hi> or Grooms
of the Kings Chamber, who pass also for Gentlemen. All the rest are <hi>Hombres, Honrados,</hi>
and <hi>Soldados.</hi> The former are Merchants or Tradesmen, and appear publickly with the
same gravity, and almost with the same retinue as Gentlemen; in as much as, some only
excepted, who cut Leather for Shooes, and Stuffes for Clothes, all the rest have their business
done by Slaves.</p>
                  <p>No Person of Quality goes abroad afoot; for some are carried by their Slaves in a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanquin,</hi>
and others ride on Horseback, or go in painted and gilty Gondoles; but not any
without a Slave to carry an Umblello, or Fan.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portuguez</hi> have the reputation of being very highly conceited of themselves;<note place="margin">The <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi> of <hi>Goa</hi> pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then any other.</note> but
those of <hi>Goa</hi> are such in so high a degree, as well in their gate, as all their other actions,
that they treat, as unacquainted with the World, such as are newly come from <hi>Portugal,</hi>
and are not accustom'd to their manner of going and life. They are excessively civil one
to another; nay, they are, in this, so ceremonious and exact, that he who should omit to
render a person, that gives him a visit, the honour he conceives due to himself, whether it
be in making him sit down otherwise then he would, or not bringing him to the street-door,
must expect the effects of a deep resentment, whereof the least are cudgelling or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which they liberally bestow on persons of mean condition, who being below them,
have omitted giving them the respect they look for from those that are not their Equals,
though indeed they owe them not any.</p>
                  <p>Winter begins there towards the end of <hi>Iune,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Winter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in <hi>June.</hi>
                     </note> with a South-west Wind, which comes
from the Sea, and reigns for the space of four moneths, all along that Coast, from <hi>Diu,</hi> as
far as the Cape of <hi>Comory;</hi> and during all that time, the Sea is not only innavigable, but
there are few Havens, where Ships can ride in safety, and unexpos'd to Storms, mixt with
terrible Thunder and Lightning, which disturb the Air there in that season. Which is
yet so much the more to be wondred at, inasmuch as, at the same time, the Coast of <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandel,</hi>
which is in the same <hi>Peninsula,</hi> and at the same degree of elevation, and in some
places is but twenty Leagues distant from that of <hi>Malabar,</hi> enjoyes a pleasant Spring, and
the most divertive season of the year. Accordingly, those who go from <hi>Cochim</hi> to Saint
<hi>Thome,</hi> by land, as they pass over the Mountain of <hi>Balagatta,</hi> which divides the whole
<hi>Peninsula,</hi> as the <hi>Apennine</hi> does <hi>Italy,</hi> discover, from the top of the Mountain, on the one
side, a clear and temperate Air, and on the other, a Country cover'd with a perpetual mist,
and drown'd with the Rains that continually fall. The same observation may be also
made in those Ships, which go from <hi>Ormus</hi> to the Cape of <hi>Rosalgate.</hi> Where, as they pass
the Cape, they suddenly pass out of fair Weather, into dreadful Storms and Tempests.
Whence it comes that, in those parts, there are but two Seasons, as there are also principally
but two Winds that reign there in the Summer time, to wit, those of the East, which the
<hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Therentos,</hi> which come from the Land-side, and blow from mid-night till
mid-day; but they are not felt above ten Leagues within the Sea; and those of the West,
which they call <hi>Virasons,</hi> which come from the Sea, immediately after dinner, and blow all
the rest of the day.</p>
                  <p>This change of Seasons from one extremity to another is the cause of many Diseases
among the <hi>Portuguez;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of those parts.</note> but the most common there are those which they call <hi>Mordexin,</hi>
which kills immediately, burning Feavers, and bloudy Fluxes, against which they have in a
manner no remedy but bleeding. The Plague is a Disease not known in the <hi>Indies;</hi> but,

For, though the Country produces present and topical Remedies against the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
yet so violent are their inclinations to Women, who, on the other side, are as mad for
Men, that they will not take the time to be cur'd of a Disease, which is not got off by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
if they be not accompany'd with a very regular diet. The Women of those parts

                     </gap>ave an excessive affection for white Men, and, being kept very much in restraint, they are

They extract the juyce of it, while it is green, or they beat the Seed to powder, and
mix it in Conserves, or put it into his drink, whom they would reduce to that condition
for twenty four hours: during which time he is depriv'd the use of all his Senses, so that
he does not see what is done before him, though his eyes be open, unless some body moisten
the soles of his seet with fair water, which revives and recovers him, much after the same
manner as if he awoke out of a sound sleep.</p>
                  <p>There are few <hi>Portuguez</hi> Women, or <hi>Mestizes,</hi> seen going about the City; and when
they go abroad,<note place="margin">The Women go abroad.</note> either to Church, or upon necessary Visits, they are carried in close <hi>Palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins,</hi>
or are attended and watch'd by so many Slaves, that it is impossible to speak to them.
When they appear in publick, they are all very richly attir'd, in Velvet, Flower'd-Sattin, or
Brocado, and adorn'd with abundance of Pearls and precious Stones; but at home, they
go in their Hair, and have about them only a Smock, which reaches to the Navil; and
thence downwards, they have Petticoats of painted Clothes falling down to the Feet,
which are bare. They eat no Bread, as liking the Rice better, now that they are accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it; nor do they fare over-deliciously as to other things, their ordinary sustenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Salt-fish, <hi>Mangas,</hi> or only Rice, soak'd in a little Flesh or Fish-broath. They make use
of certain Bottles, made of a kind of black Earth, which they call <hi>Gorgolettes,</hi> and have a
Pipe coming up to the brims, so as that they may suck up the Water without lifting up the
Bottles to their mouths.</p>
                  <p>The Men there are so jealous of their Wives,<note place="margin">The jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the <hi>Portuguez</hi>
                     </note> that they permit not their nearest Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to see them: for Chastity is so strange a Vertue in those parts, that there is no Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
but contrives all the wayes imaginable to pursue her enjoyments, never minding the
breach of those Laws which God and Nature hath imposed upon them, though the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
misfortunes which happen upon that occasion should engage them to be more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and reserv'd. The perpetual idle life they lead makes them so high in their desires,
for they do not any thing of business in the world, but spend the day in chewing of <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tele,</hi>
which adds fuel to the flames of their lewd inclinations, as do also the Cloves and Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs,
which they eat, out of an imagination that they prevent the corruptions of the Teeth
and Stomack, which commonly make the Breath stink.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Women, who conceive by an <hi>European,</hi> have so great an affection for their
Children, that they would rather dye then part with them. Children are not cloath'd till
they are of age to wear Breeches: and till that time they are brought up by Slaves, or
other <hi>Indian</hi> Women.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiers live after another rate among them.<note place="margin">The <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> For those who go in that quality
from <hi>Portugal,</hi> do not list themselves under any particular Captain, nor will be engaged to
continue in any one certain place to keep Garrison there: but when they come to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
they do what they please themselves. Accordingly they have no pay, but when
they are in actual service upon the Engagements they are forc'd to at Sea, against the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labars,</hi>
or the <hi>Dutch.</hi> But the Captains, who have occasion for these people, treat them
with much civility, and give them now and then somewhat towards their subsistence,
that they may be assured of their persons and services, when they have any work for
them: so that they have what to live upon, yet spend not much. For commonly they
live ten or twelve in the same house, where they diet together, having but two or three
Servants among them, and as many Suits of Clothes, for those who go abroad, either
to beg, or upon some design, while the rest stay at home, till their turns come to march
out.</p>
                  <p>The Marriages and Christenings of the <hi>Portuguez</hi> are celebrated with very great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.<note place="margin">Their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and Christnings.</note>
The Friends and Relations come on horseback to the Bridegrooms door, and
thence march before him to Church, into which he enters, accompanied by two of his
Friends, who are instead of God-fathers to him; and the Bride follows him in a <hi>Palanquin,</hi>
accompanied also by her two God-fathers. After the benediction of the marriage, they
reconduct the new married couple to their house, into which only the God-fathers enter
with the young couple, who go into a Balcony, or stand at a Window, to give the company
thanks, which in the mean time shew a thousand tricks in the Street. Their Chistenings
are performed, in a manner, with the same Ceremonies, save that, at these there is carried
an Ewer with a clean Napkin, a Salt-sellar, and in the midst a Silver Basin, in a heap of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or other Flowers, a Wax-candle, into which they put a piece of Gold or Silver, for an
Offering to the Priest. The God-father, and the Mid-wife, are carried with the Child in
<hi>Palanquins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Most of the <hi>Portuguez</hi> have many Slaves of both Sexes,<note place="margin">Their Slaves.</note> whom they employ not only
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47786:239"/>
about their persons, but also upon any other business they are capable of; for what they
get comes in to the Master. Whence it comes that handsome Wenches are sought after,
to be imploy'd in the selling of Fruits, and such Commodities as the <hi>Portuguez</hi> send to
market; to the end their beauty might draw in Customers, and so they by a double way
of trading, bring in double profit to their Masters. Their keeping, as to diet, stands them
in very little; and all the cloathing they give them is only as much Linnen-cloath as will
cover the privy parts. The Children born between Slaves belong to the Master, unless
the Father will redeem them, within eight or ten dayes after they are born; which if they
let slip, they are not afterwards admitted to do it, and the Master disposes of them; and

as we do Cattle.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of the Country are Pagans,<note place="margin">The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Country, and their houses.</note> and for the most part <hi>Benjans.</hi> Their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are all of Straw, and very little, having no light but what comes in at a little low door.
All their Houshold-stuffe consists principally in certain Mats made of Rushes, which serve
them both for their lodging at night, and to lye down upon at meals. Their Dishes,
Drinking-cups, and Napkins, are made of Fig-leaves, of which they also make Pitchers
and Oyl-pots, and their ordinary sustenance is Rice, which they boyl in Earthen pots.
They daub over their Houses with Cow-dung, out of an imagination that it drives away
Fleas.</p>
                  <p>They are so superstitious, that they never go abroad till they have said their prayers; and
if they chance to meet a Crow, where-ever they be, they immediately return home, and
undertake no business of any consequence that day. When they travel, they do their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
before their <hi>Pagodes;</hi> and the <hi>Portuguez</hi> tollerate their Idolatry, upon this account,
that the Inquisition hath no power, but only over such as either are Christians, or have
been such. They have also their particular ceremonies for their Marriages, their birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
and other dayes, and seasons of the year: but they differ so little from those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have spoken already, that we shall need say nothing of them. There are among
them some very able Physitians, who are so highly respected at <hi>Goa,</hi> that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to have their Umbrellos carried with them; which is a Priviledge allowed only
persons of quality: nay the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> even to the Vice-Roy himself and the Arch-Bishop,
make use of them, rather then of those of their own Nation. They never eat but with
those of their own Sect, though they were ready to starve. Nay, in this particular they
are so scrupulous, that if, in their journey to <hi>Cochim,</hi> their provision should fall short, they
would rather starve, then be oblig'd to eat what another had sown or made ready. Most
of the Porters about <hi>Goa</hi> are Christians, as are also their Money-changes, whom they call
<hi>Xaraffes,</hi> who make an external profession of Christianity, but, in their dealing, are <hi>Iews,</hi>
apt to over-reach and deceive all that have to do with them. There are in <hi>Goa</hi> many <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canins</hi>
and <hi>Canarins,</hi> who have Shops there, and buy of the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> Porcelane, Velvet
<hi>Damask,</hi> and other Stuffes of Silk and Cotton, as also some <hi>China</hi> Commodities, all by
whole sale, and afterwards sell them again by retail. These also bring Provisions from the
Continent, and trade therein, having to that end their Brokers and Factors, who mannage
their business,<note place="margin">The <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nins</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

There are amongst them Goldsmiths, Jewellers, Gravers, and other Artizans, who do things
incomparably better then any of ours. These also farm the Kings Demesne in the Islands
of <hi>Bardes</hi> and <hi>Salsette;</hi> upon which account, having sometimes occasion to go to Law, they
are so well vers'd in the Laws and Customs of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that they need no Advocates to
plead their Causes.</p>
                  <p>Most of the <hi>Canarins</hi> are either Husband-men, or Fisher-men. There are some of them

which indeed are so little, that they can hardly carry one person: in so much that
they are frequently overturn'd, but they recover them again by swimming, cast out the
Water, and prosecute their Voyage. Though in these parts they burn the dead bodies
instead of burying of them, yet are not the Women oblig'd to burn themselves with

                  <p>The <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who live there, trade for the most part to <hi>Meca,</hi> and other places upon
the Red-sea, whither they carry Spices. The <hi>Portuguez</hi> and the <hi>Mestizes</hi> have their
greatest Trade in <hi>Bengala, Pegu, Malacca, China,</hi> and in <hi>Guzuratta,</hi> at the City of <hi>Cambaya.</hi>
No Person of Quality at <hi>Goa,</hi> but goes once a day to the Market, whither the Merchants,
nay, most Gentlemen come, as well to hear what news there is, as to see what there is to be
sold; for, from seven in the morning to nine, (after which the heat is such, as that a Man
is not able to stay there) the publick Criers, whom they call <hi>Laylon,</hi> sell there by outcry,
all sorts of Commodities, but especially Slaves of both Sexes, and Jewels. There you
shall see the Crier loaden with Chains, Gold Rings, and precious Stones, and followed by a
great number of Slaves, all to be sold. There are also to be sold there, <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Horses, Spices, all sorts of Aromatick Gums, <hi>Alcatifs,</hi> Porcelane, Vessels of Agat, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things made of <hi>Lacque,</hi> and whatever is thought precious or rare in any other part of
the <hi>Indies.</hi> Merchants and Tradesmen are distinguished by Streets; so that Silk-men are
not shuffled in among Linnen-Drapers; nor the Druggists among those who sell Porce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane.
The greatest profit they make is in the exchange of Money. For when the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Fleet comes in, they buy Ryals at ten or twelve in the hundred loss; and in <hi>April,</hi> when
the Ships go away for the <hi>Molucca's</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> where the Ryals are much esteem'd, they
fell them again at twenty five or thirty in the hundred profit, notwithstanding the Order
there is to sell them at four hundred Reis. They make the same advantage by the change
of the <hi>Laris,</hi> which they also sell at ten or twelve in the hundred profit.</p>
                  <p>They have several sorts of money.<note place="margin">Their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> The least is that which hey call <hi>Basarucques,</hi> which
on the one side have a Globe, on the other two Arrows cross'd. They are made of Tin
and Lattin mixt together, and eight of these <hi>Basarucques</hi> make a <hi>Ventin,</hi> whereof five make
a <hi>Tanghe.</hi> Five <hi>Tanghes</hi> make a <hi>Serafin</hi> of Silver, which, according to the King. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
is set at three hundred <hi>Reis,</hi> and six <hi>Tanghes</hi> make a <hi>Pardai.</hi> The <hi>Serafin</hi> hath on
the one side Saint <hi>Sebastian,</hi> on the other a sheaf of Arrows. There are also <hi>Serafins</hi> of
Gold, coined heretofore at <hi>Ormus,</hi> of a more refin'd metal then any other Moneys of the
<hi>Indies;</hi> whence it comes, that the Gold-smiths melt down all that fall into their hands of
them. They have also <hi>Santemes</hi> of 16. <hi>Tanghes,</hi> and <hi>Pagodes</hi> of 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. and 16.
<hi>Tanghes.</hi>

and as much at their going out; but the Farmers of the Customs are so reasonable in their
valuing of them, that the Merchants have no cause to complain. They have also this
favour, that if a Merchant hath paid the Customs at his coming in, and hath not put
off his Commodities, he may carry them to some other place, without paying ought
at the Exportation. In like manner, a forreign Merchant that hath bought of a
<hi>Portuguez,</hi> or other Citizen of <hi>Goa,</hi> Spices, or any other Commodities of <hi>Malacca</hi> or
<hi>China,</hi> may enter them under the Sellers name, and so avoid paying the Customes due at

                  <p>The Viceroy at the time of our being there,<note place="margin">The Viceroy of <hi>Goa.</hi>
                     </note> was <hi>D. Pedro de Silva.</hi> His person was
not answerable to his quality, but he had about him above fifty Gentlemen, who gave him
the same respect as they could have done the King himself. This charge is continued in
the same person, but for three years, as well in regard it were dangerous, a Subject should
longer be possess'd of a Dignity, which differs from the Soveraign only in time; as that
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath many Lords to gratifie with an Employment, which enriches them
sufficiently in that time. For, besides that his whole Court lies at the Kings charge, he
hath the disposal of all his Revenue, and every year makes a Visit for sixty or eighty Leagues
about, which is worth to him very much. But the Presents which the neighbouring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the Governours and under Officers make him, are not to be valued. He hath his
Council of State, and his Courts of Law and Equity. He is absolute Judge in all civil
Causes, the most important only excepted, wherein there may appeal be made to the King.
Criminal Sentences are executed there, notwithstanding the Appeal; but it is not in the
Viceroy's power to indict a Gentleman, but he is oblig'd to send him, with the Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
brought in against him, to <hi>Portugal,</hi> unless the King order some other course to be
taken with him. The Viceroy at his arrival into the <hi>Indies,</hi> lands in the Island of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>

to take possession of his charge, and what ever depends on it. His Predecessour makes

the General of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, whose name was <hi>Van Kenlen,</hi> who had intreated him to
convey some Letters to his Superiours. But he came not. In the Evening we saw all
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet under sail, whence we imagin'd that the General intended to give us a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit,

they were going to relieve the King of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> who had intreated the General to
assist him against the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> who had declar'd war against him. About noon, we were
at thirteen degrees latitude, and out of sight of land. But in regard we intended to go
towards the Coast of <hi>Malabar,</hi> upon intelligence brought us, that an <hi>English</hi> Ship, coming
from <hi>Bantam,</hi> richly loaden with Spices, had been set upon and spoil'd by the <hi>Malabar</hi>
Pyrates, the next day we chang'd our course, and took it more Eastward, so to get towards
the land. The <hi>Malabars</hi> had taken their advantage of the condition that Ship was in,
which was so over-burthen'd, that she could make use of but six Guns; they found indeed
no great difficulty to enter her; but they were no sooner in, ere the <hi>English</hi> sent above
six hundred of them, with the upper Deck into the Sea. They dispatch'd as many with
the second; but afterwards being themselves forc'd to go to the Stern, to avoid the fire,
they yielded to the <hi>Malabars,</hi> who, with the Ship, took the Captain, the Masters Mate, the
Clark, and fourteen others, whom we intended to redeem.</p>
                  <p>About noon we pass'd in sight of <hi>Monteleone,</hi>

discover, at a distance, the Vessels they conceive they may set upon with advantage, and

the <hi>Catharine,</hi> and the <hi>Seymour,</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>Weddell,</hi> one of the most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced

entertain'd into the service of a new Company, erected not long before in <hi>England,</hi> for the
trade of the <hi>Indies.</hi> Having fired some Guns to salute the Castle, we sent to Captain <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,</hi>
to know what condition the <hi>English</hi> prisoners were in; and hearing they were most
of them set at liberty, we would stay no longer on that Coast.</p>

City of <hi>Goa,</hi> as far as the Cape of <hi>Comory,</hi> or <hi>Comorin.</hi> The Country is very fertile, and
brings forth abundance of Spices, but particularly the best Pepper in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which is
most esteem'd, because the grain of it is bigger then it is any where else, even then that
which grows in <hi>Sumatra</hi> and <hi>Iava.</hi> The Inhabitants go stark naked, covering only
those parts, which Nature would not have seen even in Beasts. They make holes in the
tips of their Ears, and are black, but have not such great Lips as the Moors of <hi>Africk.</hi>
They tye up their Hair together upon the Crown of the Head, and let their Beards grow
to the full length, without any ordering or trimming, in so much that they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
those figures, under which we would represent the Devil. Nor is their disposition
unsuitable to this pleasant external shape, for they understand nothing of civility, nor are
capable of any Commerce or Conversation. They are for the most part Pyrates and
Souldiers, who may be said to have rashness rather then courage, and are expert enough
in the handling of their Armes, which are Sword and Buckler, Bows and Arrows. They
make also a kind of Muskets themselves, and use them with advantage. They obey nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Barbarians. I observ'd at <hi>Cananor,</hi> that there were some men among them, who never
par'd their Nails; and that there were others, who wore Bracelets and Rings about their
Armes. These are the Gentry of the Country, whom they call <hi>Nayres,</hi> that they may be

the Streets as they go, and perpetually cry out <hi>Po, Po,</hi> that people should make way for them.
As soon as they perceive them coming, they close on both sides, look down to the ground,
and do them reverence. Some affirm, that this punctilio of Honour, whereby they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

that most obstructed the Treaty which the <hi>Portuguez</hi> were ready to conclude with the

When they go into any House upon that score, they leave their Sword and Target at the

so stops up the mouth of the Haven, that 'tis impossible to get into it or out of it, during

again, which carries along with it the filth which the Rain had left in that place.</p>

our Guns, for the Ship was so loaden that every hole was full. However we had the time

their Frigots, and made three or four others incapable of further ingaging. Our small Shot

command his Forces; wherein <hi>Derma</hi> improv'd so well, and acquir'd such reputation, that
the Army, who conceiv'd it would be a happiness to be under a Martial Prince, established
him in the Throne, this unnatural Child having first taken away the lives of his Father

but he began his reign with such severity, and ordered so many executions, that
they who murmur'd most were compell'd to entertain what they could not hinder, till
such time as they found means to make him away by poyson.</p>
                  <p>The death of <hi>Derma,</hi> and that of the King of <hi>Candy,</hi> which happened much about a
time, very much advanced the establishment of the <hi>Portuguez</hi> in this Island. For, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

intermarrying with them, they stood fair to become Masters of the Island, had it not
been for the opposition of one Lord of the Nation, of whom they had good reason to be
confident. His name was <hi>Fimala Derma Suri Ada,</hi> and was grand <hi>Modeliar,</hi> that is,
Constable of the Kingdom of <hi>Candy,</hi> when the King dyed. He was Son to one of the
chief Princes of the Kingdom, and in his youth had his breeding amongst the <hi>Portuguez,</hi>
who brought him to <hi>Colombo,</hi> where he was baptized, and named <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> in
remembrance of the natural Brother of <hi>Philip</hi> the second King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Afterward
they educated him at <hi>Goa,</hi> whither they brought him at such time as <hi>D. Emanuel de Sousa

                     </note> The <hi>Portuguez</hi> observing him to be a graceful person, and
being, as they thought, sure of his affection, made no difficulty to confer upon him the Office
of Grand <hi>Modeliar</hi> of <hi>Candy,</hi> and by this means to set him in the first rank of the whole
Kingdom, wherein <hi>D. Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> made such use of his trust, that he gain'd the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of all the Souldiery, so as that after the decease of the King, the <hi>Cingales</hi> promoted
him to succeed in his place.</p>
                  <p>The first thing he did, was to put to death all the <hi>Portuguez</hi> in the Town of <hi>Candy,</hi> and
to declare war against the rest. There was yet a Princess, Heir to the Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with design to make use of her when occasion should require, as in the present Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
it did. For <hi>Pedro Lopes de Sousa,</hi> Captain General of <hi>Malacca,</hi> conceiving he could
raise the Inhabitants of <hi>Candy</hi> in favour of this Princess, enters the Kingdom with a
powerful Army, and with him brings along <hi>D. Katharina</hi> with intention to marry her, by
which means he would make himself King, having first caused her to be acknowledged
Heir. He became Master of the capital Town without much difficulty, but that prov'd
his ruine. For <hi>D. Iohn,</hi> who, with his <hi>Cingales,</hi> was retir'd to the Woods, did not only
annoy him in cutting off all the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> who came out of the Town for forrage or
other necessaries of livelihood; but he so cut off all Provisions, that <hi>Lopes,</hi> to maintain his
Army, was constrain'd to betake himself to the Field, and leave the Town, to give <hi>D. Iohn</hi>
battel.<note place="margin">Gives Battle.</note> It was fought in the year 1590. upon a Sunday; and notwithstanding the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the <hi>Portuguez</hi> had of their Fire-arms, and above fourty Elephants arm'd for war;
<hi>D. Iohn,</hi> who would now have no other name then <hi>Fimala Derma Suri Ada,</hi> routed and
absolutely defeated them. <hi>Lopes</hi> was kill'd upon the place, and <hi>D. Katharina</hi> became pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47786:242"/>
to <hi>Fimala,</hi> who afterwards married her, by this means acquiring a right to the Crown,
which before he only held by the Sword.</p>
                  <p>Four years after this Victory, <hi>D. Ieronimo d' Azeuedo,</hi> General of the Conquests of <hi>Zei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
having receiv'd Orders from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for a new attempt on the Kingdom

and <hi>Hidalgos</hi> attendance:<note place="margin">The second Battle given.</note> he advances to <hi>Ballene</hi> the place where the first Battle was

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portuguez</hi> were not more fortunate in this, then they had been in the former battle;
for though the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Army receiv'd not a defeat, and <hi>D. Ieronimo</hi> got high honour by
his retreat for five dayes together in fight of the Kings Army, that pursued him to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<hi>Portuguez</hi> durst never attempt the Kingdom of <hi>Candy</hi> by force. Nevertheless they cease
not to maintain a war by surprizes and incursions one upon another.</p>
                  <p>For not long before the <hi>Hollanders</hi> arrived in the Isle of <hi>Zeilon,</hi>

making no difficulty to plant themselves in places where there is no publick exercise of
Religion, easily lose that whereof they had only a fleight and superficial knowledge; so
this man having renounc'd his Religion, undertook to betray his Country-men, as I am
about to tell you. This <hi>Ieronimo,</hi> being prisoner to the King, remain'd at <hi>Candy</hi> till he
had contrived the means to betray the <hi>Portuguez.</hi> Afterwards he escaped, and returning
to <hi>D. Ieronimo d' Azeuedo,</hi> told him, that if he thought fit, he would undertake to kill the
King of <hi>Candy. Azeuedo</hi> supposing after the Kings death, 'twould not be hard for him to
possess himself of the Kingdom, hearkens to the Proposition, raises to himself an assurance
in a Man, who undertakes in cold bloud to murther a Soveraign Prince; allows him three
Captains, <hi>Christoval Iacomo, Albert Primero,</hi> and <hi>Iean Pereina,</hi> with two Souldiers, to assist
him in this enterprize, which he made appear very feasible: promising to make him King
of <hi>Candy</hi> immediately upon the Kings expiration, and furnishing him with a good sum of
money for the purpose, without which, he said, there was nothing to be done. <hi>Dias</hi> would
go alone, as well that he might seem to have escaped from the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> as to dispose the
King to put these five <hi>Portuguez,</hi> his Complices, into the Fort of <hi>Ballene;</hi> for that he was to
perswade the King, that they came likewise to render themselves to him, to serve against
the other <hi>Portuguez:</hi> but being come to the King, he discover'd the double dealing he
had contriv'd, so as the night following, the King re-inforc'd the Garrison of <hi>Ballone</hi> Fort,
and went in person thither, on design to surprize the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> who were ambuscado'd in
the Woods, to affault the Fort upon notice of the Kings death.</p>
                  <p>These five <hi>Portuguez,</hi> Confederates in <hi>Dias</hi>'s treason, being arrived at the Fort, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

and put into Irons: which could not be carried with so much secrecy, but some of
those <hi>Cingales</hi> the <hi>Portuguez</hi> brought along with them discovered it, so as returning with
speed they gave notice to the <hi>Portuguez</hi> in the Ambuscade, who otherwise had run the
hazard to be cut in pieces through the ill success of the enterprize. <hi>Ieronimo Dias</hi> for his
service was rewarded with the dignity of Grand <hi>Modeliar,</hi> which he enjoy'd at the time

                     <hi>Fimala Derma Suri Ada</hi> had gotten some tincture of Christian Religion, if at least it be
to be found amongst the <hi>Portuguez;</hi> it was soon raz'd out by the compliance he had for
the <hi>Cingales;</hi> and after his decease his Successors fell back to Paganism. There are some
amongst them, who adore the head of an Elephant, wrought in wood or stone, and say,
their intention is to obtain wisdom; for they are of opinion, the Elephants of <hi>Ceilon</hi> are
not only more knowing then other Elephants, but further, that they out-go men in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
In their houses they have a Basket, wherein they put such things as they design for
an offering to their <hi>Pagodes,</hi> to whom they have a particular devotion in their sicknesses,

the World shall not perish so long as their grand <hi>Mosquey,</hi> which may be seen at a great
distance from the Sea, between <hi>Punto de Gallo</hi> and <hi>Monte Calo,</hi> shall be extant. Another
particular opinion they have of a Mountain in this Island call'd <hi>Pico d' Adam,</hi> and say it
was there that the first Man was fram'd; that the Spring on the top of this Mountain
rose from the tears <hi>Eve</hi> shed for <hi>Abel;</hi> and that the Isle of <hi>Ceilon</hi> was part of the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
<hi>Paradise.</hi> To conclude, they are very docile, and willing to acknowledge the errours
of their Idolatry; in so much that there were great likelihood of their conversion, if
<hi>Christians</hi> would undertake these long Voyages, as much out of a religious zeal, as worldly
concernments.</p>

                  <p>The Island produces Pepper, but their chiefest Commodity is Cinnamon. They find
here Mines of Brass and Iron; and certainly there is both Gold and Silver,<note place="margin">Mines of Gold and Silver.</note> especially in
the Kingdom of <hi>Candy,</hi> but the King will not permit a search to be made for the discovery
thereof. Their rich Stones they permit not likewise to be sold to Strangers, which are
there found in great abundance; but there is so great plenty thereof, that it is impossible
but some may be had under hand; for they are found in the heaps of Gravel, and in the
Town of <hi>Candy;</hi> nay, after the Rain hath washed down the Earth of some neighbouring
Mountains, the Inhabitants find them in the currents of Water, and though they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd

                  <p>The Island likewise yields Timber and Stone for building; the Soyl produces Corn,
Oyl and Wine, if any Man will take the pains to plant the Vine, Cotton, several Roots for
Dyers, Ginger, <hi>Cardamoms, Mirobalans, Corcoma,</hi> and divers other Medicinable Drugs,
Nutmegs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but particularly so great a quantity of Rice, that the whole Coast of <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandel</hi>

                  <p>The Calm staid our Ship hard by this Isle, for near upon three weeks, which I imploy'd
in inquiring of our President and certain <hi>Iesuits,</hi> who were aboard our Vessels, into this
pleasant part of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which I had never seen, and merits to be known by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
I shall make from the report of these persons, amongst whom there were some
who had spent there the best part of their lives. I will then begin with the place where
we were, and faithfully deliver you all I could learn of those Kingdoms and Provinces,
which without question are the wealthiest of any in the World.</p>
                  <p>Towards the Cape of <hi>Comory,</hi> or <hi>Comorin,</hi> where we then were, are likewise those
Islands the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Maldivas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dives.</note> or <hi>Maldivar.</hi> They extend along the Coast of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar,</hi>
having the Cape upon the North, and taking up about sevenscore Leagues by Sea,
which divides them into such small parcels, that they are esteem'd near upon a thousand.
Some are inhabited, others not, by reason they lye so low the Sea often drowns them, as it
doth likewise the Skirts of the Continent, near <hi>Cochim,</hi> and <hi>Crangonar.</hi> The <hi>Malabares</hi>
say, that heretofore they were joyn'd to the Continent, and were separated by the Sea,
which in some places hath left such narrow divisions, that an active man might leap from
one side to the other. The Capital City, which consists of four Islands, and gives them
the appellation of <hi>Maldives,</hi> or <hi>Naldive,</hi> is a place famous for trading, and the Residence for
the King of all the Islands. Except Cocoes, which are there in great abundance,
they produce little, notwithstanding the Inhabitants by industry make very neat Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
both of Silk and Thread brought from other places; in so much that set aside
the <hi>Moguls,</hi> there are not amongst the <hi>Indians</hi> any that go more neatly apparrell'd then
they.</p>
                  <p>As concerning <hi>Coromandel,</hi>

                     </note> the Eastern part of the <hi>Indies</hi> on this side <hi>Ganges</hi> is so called,
a Coast divided from the <hi>Malabares</hi> by the Mountain <hi>Balagatta,</hi> extending from South to
North, from the Cape of <hi>Comorin,</hi> or rather the point of <hi>Negapatam,</hi> to the River <hi>Nagund,</hi>
and the Town of <hi>Masulepatam,</hi> containing all along the Coast, about a hundred Leagues.
'Tis the more commodious, for that it serves for a retreat to all Vessels which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to quit the Coast of <hi>Gusuratta</hi> during the Winter season, and it hath many good
Havens, and the best Roads of any in all the <hi>Indies.</hi>

called themselves <hi>Christians,</hi> crav'd protection of the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and that arriving
at Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> they found <hi>Christians</hi> who made profession of the <hi>Greek</hi> Religion. For
this purpose they tell a Story grounded on a Tradition, which nevertheless is not to be
proved out of the Ecclesiastical History.<note place="margin">A History of Saint <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>
                     </note> Thus then they say, that Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> one of
our Saviours twelve Apostles, having long preach'd the Gospel in the Kingdom of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singia,</hi>
notwithstanding the opposition of the <hi>Bramans,</hi> resolv'd to petition the King that
he might build a Chappel for the doing of his Devotions, and that the <hi>Bramans</hi> engag'd
the King to deny him the favour. But it happened that a huge piece of Timber was so
lodg'd in the mouth of the Haven, belonging to the Town of <hi>Meliapour,</hi> then the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis
of the Kingdom, that not only great Vessels, but the smaller Barks, being not able to
get in, the Trade of the Town was in a short time quite lost. There was a trial made with
a company of Elephants to remove the Tree, but in vain; then the Magicians of those
parts were imploy'd to try if their Art could do what strength could not effect, but to as
little purpose; wherefore the King proclaim'd a considerable reward to him that could
clear the Haven, which invited the Saint to offer his service, and this for no other reward,
then the mere Timber it self. His proffer to draw it out himself made him at first appear
ridiculous, and specially when they saw him tye his Girdle to it, to draw out a weight
that many Elephants had not the strength to stir; but he pulling, the Beam followed, as
easily as if it had been a little Boat, which when he had laid upon the Land, the King was
amaz'd with admiration, and in honour of the Miracle, permitted him to build the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
as he had requested. The <hi>Bramans</hi> seeing their Doctrine disparag'd by this Miracle,
and that if Christian Religion began to spread in those parts, there was little hope to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Pagan; they resolve to free themselves of the Apostle, and cause certain <hi>Panyms</hi> to
murther him while he was at his Devotions in his Chappel. Some there are who will have
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47786:244"/>
the Church dedicated to this Saint in that place, to be built by a King of <hi>Narsinga,</hi> and
that the door was made of that miraculous beam; but the <hi>Portuguez</hi> say they built it, of
which indeed there is most probability.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lentscholen</hi> saith, that in these parts there are certain people with one leg bigger
then the other, and that they are held to be the Progeny of those that martyred the
Apostle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maffeus,</hi> in the eighth Book of his <hi>Indian History,</hi> relates how <hi>Iohn</hi> the second King of
<hi>Portugal</hi> made search for the bones of this Saint upon the Coasts of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> which he
transported to <hi>Goa,</hi> where he built a fair Church in honour of him: but if credit may be
given to <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> in their Ecclesiastical History, the Apostle Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

to his Sepulchre; yet <hi>Marco Paulo Veneto</hi> sayes otherwise, though with some contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to himself. <hi>Gasper Balbi</hi> a <hi>Venetian</hi> Jeweller, who hath made a very handsome relation
of his Travels in the <hi>Indies,</hi> sayes, That, being at the Town of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> in the year
1582. there was a Church then building in the honour of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist;</hi> and that
the building almost finished, they found they wanted Timber to perfect it, when at the
same time the Sea cast a Tree ashore of such a bulk, that looking on it as a thing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
they would needs measure it; and finding it to be a just proportion for the Edifice,
the people cryed out a Miracle, wherein they were confirm'd, when sawing it, it yielded
just so many Beams as serv'd to finish the Church. Headds further, that the Tree came
from some far distant place, because in cutting, it sent forth such a stinking smell, that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
the whole Country. The Town of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> is not very great, but the greatest
part of the Houses are of Stone, and well built. The Church there hath no Steeple, yet
may be seen at a good distance. There live here about six hundred <hi>Portuguez,</hi> or <hi>Mestizes,</hi>
besides some <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchants.</p>

                  <p>The South and South-west Winds reign here from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>September,</hi> during which
time the Road is very good; but all the rest of the year, small Barks are constrain'd to get
into the River <hi>Palacatte,</hi> and greater Vessels into the Haven of <hi>Negupatam.</hi> You have five
fathom water even within Cannon-shot of the Town; but the Sea is so rough at all
times, there is no Landing without danger!</p>
                  <p>Upon this Coast the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have divers Plantations where they drive a great Trade;
but principally at <hi>Potlapouli,</hi> otherwise call'd <hi>Nisapatam,</hi> where they have had their

                  <p>This Country was heretofore divided into three Kingdoms, that is, <hi>Coromandel, Narsinga</hi>

                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Pegu</hi> joyns upon <hi>Bengala,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pegu.</note> upon the East-side, and takes its name
from the capital City, where the King hath placed the Seat of his Monarchy. This is a
very potent State, and as <hi>Gaspar Balbi</hi> sayes, (whom I follow in this Relation, because I
saw not the Country) the Metropolis is divided into two parts; the one called the old,
the other the new Town. The King, with all that relate to the Court, live in the latter,
and Merchants and Tradesmen inhabit the other. For the greatest part, the dwelling-houses
are built of Canes, but they are joyn'd to Ware-houses that are vaulted to prevent
fire. The new Town is four-square, and the Flankers of it so streight, that from any Gate
thereof one may discover both corners of the Wall. There are Bastions of Timber,<note place="margin">Crocodiles in the Moat.</note> and
a large Moat, full of water, where they keep Crocodiles to secure the Town from surprizal.
The <hi>Peguans</hi> hold this Creature to have something Divine about it, whence it comes they
are so desirous to drink the water, though they fetch it not without danger of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by the Crocodiles, as it often happens. Notwithstanding, they water their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
there; but this is a Beast that strikes terrour in the Crocodiles, and would be too
hard for them.</p>
                  <p>The Palace Royal stands in the middle of the City,<note place="margin">The Palace Royal.</note> and hath its peculiar Fortifications,
Walls and Moats, whereby it is divided from the Town. The Castle is said to be much
more spacious then the City of <hi>Venice;</hi> and that there is no entrance but on the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
by two Ports, and as many Draw-bridges. Within the first Port are the Houses of
the Grandees, who enter not into the body of the Castle, without express Order from the
King. His Guard consisting of a great number of Souldiers, with them called <hi>Bramas,</hi>
is kept at the second Port,<note place="margin">The Guard.</note> where they sit, having their Arms hanging before them on the
Wall. In this place are the Stables for Elephants, as well such as are kept for the Princes
service, as those design'd for War, being about eight hundred in number. The Kings Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment
is exceeding rich, painted Azure, with Flowers of Gold; and when the King
gives Audience, he appears in great magnificence. In his hand he holds a Fan, to Fan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and on his head he hath a quadruple Crown of Gold, enamell'd white. Near his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
stand four Youths, whom he makes use of in his brutalities; and before him all the
Grandees of the Court, who whensoever they speak to him lift their hands above their
head, and bow down to the ground. Being sate, they bring before him his fairest Elephants,
and amongst the rest his white one, which is said to be the only one in all the <hi>Indies,</hi> nor
ever is there more then one to be seen at Court, which was brought thither after the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he gain'd against the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> with whom he had not made War but to gain that
Beast, as we shall tell you anon. These Beasts make their reverence to him, and testifie
a Worship to his Person. If we may give credit to the fore-mentioned <hi>Balbi,</hi> this,
next the King of <hi>China,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Kings Forces</note> is the most Potent Prince on Earth. He sayes, this Prince can
bring into the Field fifteen hundred thousand Men, and above eight hundred Elephants,
and that his Treasure is sufficient for so mighty an Army, by reason every Person of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is oblig'd to raise and maintain so many Men of War at his own proper charges.</p>
                  <p>He relates to this purpose, that, in his time, the King of <hi>Auva,</hi>

King of <hi>Auva;</hi> sent him an Embassadour extraordinary to reduce him to his Duty, and
perswade him to come in again to him: but his Uncle, instead of taking the advantage of
his Nephews Nobleness, puts the Embassadour to death, and declares War against the King
of <hi>Pegu.</hi> But he having raised an Army of three hundred thousand men, before he would
march into the Field, purg'd his Court, and put to death those Traytors who had ingagede
to deliver him into the hands of his Uncle. Assembling then all the Confederates of this
Treason, under pretence of calling them to a Councel about this War; he caused them to

till he receiv'd express Order under his Signet; but the <hi>Dogad gini,</hi> or Judge, who had

                  <p>That done, the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> appeared in the head of his Army, mounted on an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
covered with trappings of Tissue, having by his side a Sword, that was presented
him by <hi>D. Lewis of Atayda,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Goa,</hi> resolving to march in few dayes against his
Uncle, but he was hindred by the small Pox, which he had in extremity. As soon as he
was recovered,<note place="margin">A single Combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Kings.</note> he causes the Army to advance to the very Frontiers of <hi>Auva,</hi> where he
accepts a Challenge sent him by his Uncle, that they two might decide the difference
by a single Combat; and was so fortunate, as to kill his Adversary, in view of both
Armies. This single Victory was of greater advantage, then a defeat of the Enemies
whole Army could have brought him: for the whole Kingdom of <hi>Auva</hi> delivered it
self up, at mercy: The Queen, who was his Sister, fell likewise into his hands, and was
prisoner during life, though kept in a Princely Palace, and honoured and attended as a
Queen.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> in acknowledgment of the service his Elephant had done him in the
Combate, where he fell dead under his Master, caused certain <hi>Pagodes</hi> to be made of his

Arm, a Chain of Diamonds and other Stones inestimable. In the same Chappel are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
three Statues of Silver, higher by two foot then the first; with Crowns set with
Gems, and a fourth more massive and rich then all the rest, and besides these a Figure made
of <hi>Ganza,</hi> which is a mixt metal of Copper and Brass, valued at as high a rate as the
other four. The Kings Father, who lived in the year 1578. caused these Statues to be
made in memory of that famous Victory he obtain'd over the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> in the War
he made against him, for the white Elephant we spoke of.</p>
                  <p>The Forrests of <hi>Pegu</hi> have greater store of Elephants then all the <hi>Indies</hi> besides,<note place="margin">The <hi>Pegu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Arms.</note> and
they are tam'd with very little trouble, in ten or twelve dayes after they are taken by the
means of Females, who intice them out of the Woods, and make them follow into the very
Stables, where there are Dens that hold but one of these Beasts only, where they shut them
close in as soon as they are entred.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Peguans</hi> have Fire-arms, but ordinarily they use half Pikes made of Canes, short
and broad Swords, and long and narrow Bucklers made of boyl'd Leather doubled, and
laid over with a certain black Gum call'd <hi>Achiran;</hi> their <hi>Salades</hi> or Helmets are made of
the same stuff, and like ours in fashion.</p>
                  <p>They are generally <hi>Pagans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">They are <hi>Pagans.</hi>
                     </note> except some who contracting alliance with the <hi>Portuguez,</hi>
have embrac'd their Religion. These <hi>Pagans</hi> believe that God, who hath under him many
other Gods, is the Author of all good which arrives to Mankind; but the disposing of all
evil he leaves to the Devil,<note place="margin">Adore the Devil.</note> to whom these wretches bear more veneration then they do
to God; because the one will do them no hurt; and they must please the other, that he
may not.</p>
                  <p>They do they Devotions ordinarily on the Munday,<note place="margin">Their Feasts.</note> and have besides, five principal
Feasts which they call <hi>Sapan.</hi> The first, which they call <hi>Sapan Giacchi,</hi> is chiefly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
by a Pilgrimage, made by the King and Queen, twelve Leagues out of Town, where
they appear in triumphal Chariots, so set with precious Stones, that, without Hyperbole,
it may be said they carry the worth of a Kingdom about them. They call the second,
<hi>Sapan Carena,</hi> observ'd in honour of the Statue kept in the grand <hi>Varelle</hi> of the Castle, in
honour of which the Noblemen of the Court erect Pyramides of Canes, which they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with several Stuffs artificially wrought of divers fashions, then have them put into
Chariots drawn by above three hundred persons to the Kings view, that he may judge of
their inventions. All the people come likewise, and bring their Offerings to him. The
<hi>Sapan Giaimo Segienon,</hi> they celebrate also in honour of some of these Statues, where the
King and Queen are both present in person; and the fourth Feast, which they call <hi>Sapan
Daiche,</hi> is particularly celebrated in the old Town; at which the King and Queen cast
Rose-water at one another. All the Grandees have likewise a pot of Rose-water in their
hands, wherewith they so water themselves, that their bodies are as 'twere bath'd all over,
nor can any one pass the Streets that day, without hazard of being wash'd with water
thrown from the windows. At the fifth Feast, called <hi>Sapan Donon,</hi> the King and Queen
go by water to the Town of <hi>Meccao,</hi> attended by above a hundred Boats, all which row
for the fastest, to gain a Prize allow'd by the King.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:47786:245"/>
                  <p>The King dying, they prepare two Boats, which they cover with one gilt Covering, and
in the middle of these Boats they place a Table,<note place="margin">How the Kings Corps are burnt.</note> whereon they lay the dead Corps; and
underneath the Table they make a fire of the Wood of <hi>Sandale, Beniouin, Storax,</hi> and
other sweet-scented Woods and Drugs, then turn the Barks down the Stream, certain
<hi>Talapoi</hi> or Priests mean while singing and rejoycing till the flesh be intirely consum'd.
These Ashes they temper with Milk, so making a Paste, which they carry to the mouth
of the River, where they cast it into the Sea. But the Bones they bear to another
place, and bury them near a Chappel, where they build another in honour of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Talapoi</hi> carry a Bottle made of an empty Gourd at their girdle,<note place="margin">The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> and live by Alms,
as our Mendicant Friars. They are in great esteem amongst them, and they very well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their credit by their exemplary life. On Munday morning they go about with their
Tin-basins, to awake the people and invite them to a Sermon. They treat not at all of
points of Doctrine, but chiefly insist upon Morality, exhorting the Congregation to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from Murther, Thefe, Fornication and Adultery, and to do to others as they would be
done by. For this reason they are of opinion, that Men are sooner saved by good Works
and innocency of Life, then by Faith. They have no Aversion for those that forsake
their Religion to become <hi>Christans,</hi> so their Life be correspondent to the Profession they
make.</p>
                  <p>They exclaim lowdly against the Offerings the <hi>Peguans</hi> make to the Devil, particularly
when they perform any Vow they made in their sickness, or in any other unfortunate Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and endeavour to abolish this wicked custom, which is grown so inveterate, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
they have lost their labour. These people ordinarily live in Woods, and to prevent the
danger of wild Beasts, whereof these parts are full, they have their Couches hanging in the
Air betwixt boughs of Trees. They eat but once a day, and are habited in red Vestures
that reach to their heels, bare-footed, and over their Shoulders a short Coat or Mantle that
comes to their hams. They shave their heads, nay cannot endure hair upon any part of
their body; and to guard them from the Sun-beams they wear a Hat. Great honours
are done to them after their death, and after their Corps hath been attended certain dayes,
they are burnt with Sandale-wood, they cast the Ashes into the River, and inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in so much that they can afford some to their Neighbours. They have a custom to make
a Drug of certain little Fishes, which they pound in a Mortar, and being so brought to a
Paste, they lay it in the Sun to putrifie, till it be quite corrupted, and grows moist, and then
they use it in their Sauces, instead of Oyl or Butter, making a dainty of that, which it were
not possible for us to endure the smell of.</p>

young, by means of a Composition, of contrary operation to that used by common Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to heighten the pleasures of their Gallants. These little Bells are put in betwixt
the skin and the flesh: and to effect the operation, they cast them into a sleep, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Drink, to make them insensible of the pain they are put to by the Incision, whereof
notwithstanding they are cur'd in few dayes. For their greater aversion from <hi>Sodomy,</hi> they
paint the Boyes at seven or eight years of age with a certain blew, which extending with
the skin as it grows, changes into another colour, and makes them look most horribly. The
Women, on the contrary, do all they can to appear lovely, and attract the Men, covering
their privy parts only with a thin piece of Linnen, which sits not so close, but the least
wind shews all they have.</p>

                  <p>The best Commodities to be brought to <hi>Pegu,</hi> and which may be sold to greatest profit,

they transport to <hi>Malacca.</hi> In bargaining they make no words at all, they do no more
but give their Hand cover'd with a Handkerchief, and in grasping or moving their Fingers
they make their meaning known. For borrowing of money they stick not to pawn their
Wives and Children; but if the Creditour enjoyes them carnally during that time, he is
then paid, and the Debtour acquitted.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Siam.</note> one of the most considerable Kingdoms of the <hi>Indies,</hi> lying at eighteen degrees

the Gulf of <hi>Bengala,</hi> from the Haven of <hi>Martanan</hi> to the Town of <hi>Tavaga;</hi> towards the
East, <hi>Patana,</hi> whence the Coast runs first Northwards to thirteen degrees and a half, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
in this space, the Gulf of <hi>Siam:</hi> And lastly, Southward, to twelve degrees, lying
more at a distance from the Sea; it joyns Eastward on the Desarts of <hi>Cambodia,</hi> and the
Kingdoms of <hi>Iangoma, Tangou</hi> and <hi>Lansiaugh,</hi> to eighteen degrees towards the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Kingdoms of <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Auva,</hi> making as it were a semi-circle, containing near upon
four hundred and fifty Leagues. The Country in some parts is rough and mountainous,
in other parts covered with Woods, and to the Seawards 'tis low and marshy, and generally
flat, good and fertile, yielding in abundance all necessaries for livelihood; and having on
the Gulfes divers Isles, Rivers, Bayes, Harbours and Roads, commodious for the transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of such things as they themselves can spare.</p>
                  <p>The River called <hi>Menam,</hi>

                     </note> that is, Mother of the waters, is one of the greatest <hi>India</hi> hath.
The breadth of it is not great, but its length such, that hitherto no man hath discovered
the head of it. It sends its Current from North to South, passing through the Kingdoms
of <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Auva;</hi> and at last, running through <hi>Siam,</hi> by three Streams it falls into the
Gulf of <hi>Siam.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Overflows as <hi>Nile</hi> doth.</note> One quality it hath common with the <hi>Nile</hi> and <hi>Ganges,</hi> that it yearly
overflows the adjacent Country, for the space of five moneths together, destroying in that
time all Worms and Insects, and leaving, when it retires, a slime or moist soil proper for
the increase of Rice. That Channel of this River which is most commodious for Barks
or Vessels, is that, which lies most Eastwards, at thirteen degrees and a half elevation,
but what makes it almost useless, is, that there lies a Shelf a League in length, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
at the mouth of the River, which at low-water holds not above five or six foot
water.</p>
                  <p>At high-water it holds fifteen or sixteen foot, and in <hi>September, October</hi> and <hi>November,</hi>
seventeen or eighteen foot. Vessels of greater burthen ordinarily stay in the Road two
Leagues from the Shelf, where having at no time less then five or six fathom water they
ride secure. They who venture to come over the Shelf with the Tide, may go up along
the River to the City of <hi>Banckock,</hi> six Leagues from the Sea, and thence may pass by
boat in five or six dayes, as high as the City of <hi>India,</hi> twenty four Leagues within the
Land, except in the moneths before mentioned, during which season the River is inna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable.</p>
                  <p>The Provinces of this vast Kingdom are all very populous,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Siam</hi> very populous.</note> though not equally; for
such as have the Commodity of Rivers and Havens, far exceed those that lye more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.
It would be very difficult to reckon all the Towns of this great Dominion:
wherefore we will here give only an account of the principal and most considerable, either
for greatness, or as the most considerable of the several Provinces. The chief of the
Kingdom is <hi>India,</hi> by some called <hi>Odya;</hi> then <hi>Camboya, Campaa, Sincapura, Picelouck,
Surkelouck, Capheng, Soucethay, Kephinpet, Conseywan, Pytsyay, Pitsedi, Lidure, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou,
Mormelon, Martenoy, Lygor, Bordelong, Tanasserim,</hi> where the <hi>Portuguez</hi> drive a
good Trade, <hi>Banckock, Pipry, Mergy,</hi> &amp;c. Besides which, there are many more,
which rather deserve a place in a Map, then in the Relation of a particular Mans
Travels.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>India,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">India.</note> the ordinary Residence of the Court, is seated on the River <hi>Menam,</hi>
which makes an Island entirely taken up by that City, having on the River-side a strong
sufficient wall, for about two Leagues in compass, and the Suburbs on both sides the River,
as well built and adorn'd with Temples and Palaces as the Town it self. Here are divers
very fair Streets, with Channels regularly cut; but withall there are some which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
large nor fair, though the River crosses the Town in so many places, that there is
scarce a house but may be gone to by boat.</p>
                  <p>The Houses here,<note place="margin">Its houses.</note> as generally all over the <hi>Indies,</hi> are but of ordinary building, and for
the most part covered with Tiles. There are within the Town above three hundred fair
<hi>Mosqueys,</hi> or Chappels, with gilt Steeples, or Pyramides, which at a distance yield a glorious
prospect, with abundance of <hi>Pagodes</hi> of all sorts of Metals. The Palace, which is as it
were a City of it self within the other, hath its Towers and Pyramides gilt, so as the City
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47786:246"/>
of <hi>India</hi> may be said to be as beautiful, as large, and as populous as any City in <hi>India;</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
I will not affirm what <hi>Fernando Mendez Pinto</hi> writes, that it contains within its
Circuit four hundred thousand Families, whereof three quarters are <hi>Siamezes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> but thus
much I can add, that the City hath this advantage, that it is impregnable; for being of
it self strong enough to indure any Siege for many moneths; it hath an infallible relief,
which never fails at six moneths end, by reason that the River overflowing, no Line can
withstand it, nor no Camp can be so strong but must dislodge.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> that now reigns,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Siam</hi> of a very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Family.</note> and who amongst his other Titles, takes that of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau
Salcu,</hi> that is, <hi>Sacred Member of God,</hi> holds the Crown from his Ancestors, who have
possessed it for many Ages; and next to the <hi>Mogul,</hi> this Prince can reckon more Kings of
his Family, then any Prince of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is absolute Monarch in his Dominions,<note place="margin">Is absolute.</note> solely disposing, with an Independant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
of all Affairs of his Kingdom. He makes War and Peace, imposes Taxes on
his Subjects, creates Magistrates, sets value on Money, and makes Laws and Statutes,
without the consent or advice either of States or Lords: He allows them to consider of
such Affairs as come to their knowledge, and to offer him their Advice by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance;
but he reserves to himself the Power to approve, or reject, what he
pleases.</p>
                  <p>These Noble men are called <hi>Mandorins;</hi> and are there as the Privy Council, a quality
the King bestows on whom he pleases, as he doth of all other Honours in the Kingdom,
without regard either to birth or merit; because his Subjects are his Slaves, and the King
is Master of all they possess, even their very lives, whereof he hath power to dispose to his
service and advantage. 'Tis true that in this, as in deposing the <hi>Mandorins</hi> from their
Dignities, and reducing them to the rank of their fellow Subjects, he observes some appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Equity, by following in some measure the Laws of the Kingdom, but being above
the Law, he explicates and executes it as he pleases.</p>
                  <p>The Prince is exceeding magnificent in his Apparel and Train,<note place="margin">His manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nothing more then his manner of living. For the people, who seldom see him, have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Veneration for his Person, nor do the Grandees and Officers scarce ever come into his
presence. When he gives Audience, he sits most gloriously habited on a Throne of Gold,
with a Crown on his head, and at his feet the Officers and Gentlemen of the Houshold on
their knees; and not far from him a Guard of three hundred Souldiers. No one speaks to
him but on the knee, and they who come for audience present themselves in this sort, their
hands being lifted above their head, and making to him ever and anon most low reverences:
The continual inclinations that are made him, and the Titles given him, must likewise be
accompanied with oblieging speeches, and attributions beyond what either greatness or
goodness can deserve.</p>
                  <p>His Answers are receiv'd as Oracles, and his Orders executed without delay or dispute.
He hath in every Province of his Kingdom his Palaces and Gardens: when he removes his
Houshold, he hath with him a number of Elephants loaden with Tents, to be pitched when
he comes to places fit to rest in.</p>
                  <p>He hath but one Wife.<note place="margin">Hath but one Wife,</note> to whom they give the Title of Queen; but he hath an infinite
number of Concubines, which are chosen for him out of the fairest Virgins of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
He feeds very high, but drinks only Water, because the Laws both Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
prohibit the use of Wine to Persons of Quality; when he pleases to recreate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the River, he goes in a splendid gilt Barge under a Canopy of Brocadoe, attended
by some of his Domesticks, and a Guard of three or four hundred, in seven or eight other
Barges, which have each of them fourscore or a hundred Slaves to row. The Noblemen
who follow, and are sometimes to the number of a thousand or twelve hundred, have each
their several Barge.</p>
                  <p>The like is done when the King goes from his Palace into the City; Then he sits in a
Chair of Gold, born on the shoulders of ten or twelve Waiters, having marching before
him many Elephants and Horses richly harnessed, in this sort marching with a slately and
grave pace, while the people prostrate themselves to him, and render him the same honours
they might do to God himself.</p>
                  <p>He appears particularly in his greatest Magnificence on a certain day in <hi>October,</hi> designed
for this Ceremony.<note place="margin">A magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</note> On this day, he appears both in the City, and upon the River, to make
a procession to one of his chiefest <hi>Mosquees,</hi> whither he goes to sacrifice, and to do his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
for the prosperity of the State. In the head of this procession march about two
hundred Elephants, each of them carrying three arm'd Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then comes the Musick,
consisting of Hoboyes, Tabours, and Cimbals: next come about a thousand Men compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arm'd, divided into several Companies that have their Colours and Banners. Next to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47786:247"/>
these follow many Noble men on horseback, and amongst them some with Crowns of
Gold upon their Heads, with a Train of fourscore or a hundred persons on foot. Betwixt
these Noble men and the Life-guard, march two hundred Souldiers, <hi>Iaponeses,</hi> all very well
cloath'd, and go immediately before the Horses and Elephants, which are for the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
use, their harness made with Buckles and Studs of Gold, set with Diamonds and
other precious Stones. The Servants, who bear the Fruits and other things for the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
march before certain Grandees of the Kingdom, whereof one bears the Kings Standard,
the other the Scepter of Justice. These walk on foot immediately before the King, who
sits, mounted on an Elephant, in a Chair of Gold. The Prince his Son, or some other
Prince of the Bloud, follows next after him, and then comes the Queen and the Kings other
Women on Elephants, but not to be seen, as being in certain wooden Closets gilt. The
rest of the Houshold, and six hundred of the Guard, come in the Rear, which by this means
consists of fifteen or sixteen thousand persons.</p>
                  <p>As to their Procession upon the River,<note place="margin">Procession upon the River.</note> they observe the order following. First, in the
head of this Fleet march about two hundred Noble men, each in his several Barge, where
they sit in a gilt Cabin, and each Barge row'd by three or fourscore Slaves. Then follow
four Barges assign'd for the Musick, and next follow about fifty Barks of State, each having
fourscore, or fourscore and ten Rowers; and after these come ten other gilt Barges, in one
of which the King is seated in a Throne of Gold, attended by divers Noble men, all upon
their knees before him, and amongst them, one of the chiefest <hi>Mandorins,</hi> who bears his
Standard. The Prince follows after him in another <hi>Barge,</hi> and after him comes the
Queen, and the Concubines; And lastly, in a great number of other Barges, the houshold
Servants and the Guards, so as that this Procession consists of twenty five or thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
persons, who come either to see the magnificence of the Ceremony, or to adore their
Prince.</p>
                  <p>Since the thirds of all real Estates fall to the King,<note place="margin">The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</note> we may well suppose his Revenue
to be very great; but this advantage comes not near the profits accrewing to him by the
Commerce, which by Factours he holds with Strangers for his Rice, Copper, Lead, and
Salt-peter. He hath in his Country good store of Gold; and the Customs he hath of all
Merchandizes, both coming in and going out, bring considerable sums, besides the Presents
which Governours of Provinces are obliged to make him every year. A great profit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he raises by Commerce with ready Money into <hi>China,</hi> and along the Coast of <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandel,</hi>
which yields him yearly two thousand <hi>Cattys</hi> of Silver advantage. He hath
throughout his Kingdom abundance of Officers for managing of his Revenue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his Moneys, which as <hi>Mendez Pinto</hi> sayes, amounts annually to twelve Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

next his Houshold, is in building places and <hi>Mosquees,</hi> rewarding Services, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Guards, the rest comes into the Treasury, which by this means swells almost to
infinity.</p>
                  <p>Most Cities have their particular Jurisdictions, and Judges for Administration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
to take an account whereof there is a Council appointed in the City of <hi>India,</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a President, and twelve Councellors, who give a definitive Sentence, and decide all
differences brought before them by way of appeal: 'tis nevertheless allowed them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to prevent these Sentences by a Review before the Privy Councel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this happens
not frequently, by reason, the Charges are so great, very few will undertake it. They
plead by Councellors and Atturneys, both by word and writing, but in presence of both
parties who are to enter a Summary of the Plea in the Recorders Register. But besides
Counsellors and Atturneys, you have here the Pettifogger, who is inseparable; so as Suits
sometimes last whole Ages here as well as in other places.</p>
                  <p>In Criminal matters, they have an extraordinary and summary way, but much after the
same form and manner used in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, They inform, then imprison, then examine; the Parties are brought face to face;
and where evidence falls short, they are put to the Rack, upon pregnant presumptions,
The Steward records the whole, and makes report to the Judges, who upon the criminal
Confession, or Deposition of Witnesses, give Judgment, and cause the Sentence to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
immediately, without appeal, save that they never put any to death without the
Kings express Order, in whose power it lyes to confirm the Sentence, or pardon the Party,
as he pleaseth.</p>
                  <p>Their punishments are severe, rather cruel: The slightest Crime is punished with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary
Fines,<note place="margin">Their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</note> Banishment, or Transportation: For Theft they suffer amputation of Hands
or Feet, or are condemned to perpetual slavery. The ordinary punishments of these
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47786:247"/>
Countries are unknown there; but condemned persons are cast alive into boyling Oyle,
according to the atrocity of the Crime, but alwayes with Confiscation of Goods, for the
benefit of the King, and the Judges.</p>
                  <p>In want of sufficient Testimony,<note place="margin">Manners of Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> they make use of certain extraordinary wayes for
Conviction, or Justification of the Criminal, which they do by consent of all parties, with
the Judges permission, who allows them to maintain what they say, by Water, by Fire, or
by boyling Oyl. When they submit to the Tryal of Water, the Accuser, and the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
party are both let down along a great Pole, which is planted in the River, and he that
stayes longest under water gains the day; as he that patiently holds his Hand longest in
boyling Oyl. Others, who chuse the tryal of Fire, are to go five or six steps, very slowly,
in a great Fire, and that betwixt two Men, who lean as hard as they can upon their
shoulders. But the way they hold most infallible for their justification, is, to swallow a
Pill of Rice, over which their Priests have pronounced some words of malediction, which
he that swallows without spitting is so clearly justified, that his friends attend him in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
to his habitation.</p>

The King now reigning had taken so great an aversion for the <hi>Iaponeses,</hi>
on suspition they had a design upon his person, that he put some to death, and expell'd the
rest. Yet since that he hath given way for their return to their ancient trust; but, as I
said, they exceed not the number of five or six hundred. His Subjects are obliged to go
to the Wars at their own charges, so that according as occasion requires, he calls out the
hundredth, the fiftieth, the twentieth, the tenth, and sometimes the fifth man; besides
those, the Noble men, at their own charges, bring along with them a sufficient Guard of
their persons: By this means he raises at a small charge a most puissant Army, wherein
there shall be sometimes three or four thousand Elephants, though he seldom raise an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

Swords, Pikes and Bucklers, without Fire-armes. Nor are their Horse better appointed,
as being but poorly mounted; so as his chiefest strength consists in his Elephants, which
are train'd to the work, and carry each three arm'd men; but many which are brought
out with the Army are employed about the Baggage. Great Artillery they have, but
manage them ignorantly. Their Naval Forces are in as ill condition as their Land; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in a multitude of Frigots and Gallies, well furnished with Artillery, but their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and Sea-men are inexpert. There is an infinite number of Barks for service against
the Enemy upon the River, as advantagious to them as at Sea, by reason his Neighbours
are rather worse provided then he; but all his Forces joyned together were not sufficient
to oppose a <hi>Spanish, English,</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet; yet this Princes Predecessors have often had
great Victories over their Enemies, while Martial Princes have had the Conduct of their
Armies.</p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Siam</hi> have at all times pretended to a sole Monarchy over all
the Kingdoms in these parts,<note place="margin">Both the Kings of <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>Pegu</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty.</note> and without dispute <hi>Pegu</hi> had something the better, but the
continual War they have held, as well for this as other differences, hath so wasted the
Frontiers of both these Kingdoms, that the Armies are not able to subsist there any longer,
and so necessity forced them to conclude a Peace; which since they break not, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions
of some flying Army of twenty or thirty thousand, during the Summer Season.
The last War the King of <hi>Siam</hi> made upon the Kings of <hi>Iangoma</hi> and <hi>Langsgaugh</hi> were
purely out of ambition for the Soveraignty they pretended to over those Kingdoms. 'Tis
not long likewise since the King of <hi>Cambrodia,</hi> a Tributary to the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
whereupon <hi>Siam</hi> enters his Territories with a potent Army, but was opposed so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously,
that he was forced to retire. The Kingdom after this enjoyed a long peace, till
the deceased King having caused his Brother to be murthered to establish his Son upon
the Throne, one of the Princes of the Bloud took occasion to usurp the Crown, as I shall
immediately tell you.</p>
                  <p>This Usurper made shew as if he would espouse the interests of the State against the
Kings of <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Auva,</hi> and especially against the King of <hi>Cambodia,</hi> though he would

in the year 1624. the King seiz'd upon his Vessel, and forced <hi>Fernando</hi> to restore the
Frigot. Since which time the <hi>Siameses</hi> have been continually vext by the <hi>Portuguez</hi> in
their Traffick with <hi>China,</hi> though the <hi>Hollanders</hi> assist them effectually against their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and declare highly for them; as they lately likewise assisted the King of <hi>Siam</hi> with
six Ships, to chastise the Rebels of <hi>Patany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For certain, the King of <hi>Siam</hi> keeps more Elephants then any other Prince of <hi>India,</hi>
and herein consists his chiefest Forces. For though the <hi>Indians</hi> affect this Beast, of what
part so ever he is, yet have they a particular esteem for those of <hi>Siam,</hi> for their make, their
strength,<note place="margin">Elephant hunting.</note> and, as they call it, for their apprehension. They take them here as they do in
<hi>Pegu,</hi> bringing into the Forrest fifteen or twenty tame Females, which being, as it were,
Decoyes, suffer themselves to be led up and down, till some of the wild Elephants herd
with them, and so are by little and little betrai'd into a large Court well wall'd about, to
which you enter by a double walk of Trees, which as well as the Court is shut up with
strong Rails: As soon as the Elephants are in, then are the Females let out one by one at
another Gate, leaving the wild by themselves. Within this Court are two four-square
Partitions, divided with Pallizadoes like Cages, the one in the middle, the other at the side
of the wall. The posts whereof they are made, are set at such distance, that men may
with ease pass in and out to vex and provoke the Beasts; but they must make a swift re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
within their Appartment, when this formidable Foe pursues them. This is the most
acceptable divertisement can be presented to the King, who with the Nobility of his
Court is ever present at this hunting. After the Elephants are by this kind of hunting
sufficiently tired, they drive them into another close Pen no bigger then their bodies, made
of strong beams, where they tye them by the legs to three or four tame Elephants; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
hunger and acquaintance with the others, in three or four dayes bring them to live
as they do. Sometimes they hunt them in the Forrest, and open Champion, with tame
Elephants, till at last they fasten them by the legs together, and so by force drive them
away, but this not without conflict and danger.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> they meet with white Elephants.<note place="margin">A white Elephant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> All over <hi>India</hi>

say, they are the Kings of the Elephants; in so much as the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> when he meets
with one, causes him to be served in Vessels of Gold, to walk under a Canopy, and allows
him a Princely train.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1568. the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> understanding that the King of <hi>Siam</hi> had two
white Elephants,<note place="margin">The occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kings of <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Siam.</hi>
                     </note> sent a solemn Embassy to request he might buy one of them, and that
he would set a price upon him; which the King of <hi>Siam</hi> refusing, the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
to fetch him with a powerful Army. He found such slender resistance in <hi>Siam,</hi> that
the King seeing his Kingdom and chief City in the hands of his Enemies, took poyson,
whereof he dyed, though that Conquest cost the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> the lives of five hundred
thousand men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Raja Hapi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Raja Hapi <hi>King of</hi> Siam.</note> King of <hi>Siam,</hi> who lived about the year 1616. acknowledged at that time
the Soveraignty of the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> but this was only till he could find opportunity to
free himself from this subjection, as he did few years after. For entering the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Pegu</hi> with a powerful Army, he laid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iege to the City of <hi>Aracam;</hi> resolved not to
move thence till he had taken it. In effect he rais'd not the Siege, but not being able to
force the City, and unwilling to break his Oath, he built a House near it, where he dyed.
This Prince was so famous for his cruelty, that 'tis reported of him, that being sick, and
hearing two of his Concubines laugh in an anti-chamber, he commanded they should be
immediately cut to pieces. He had a Favourite, called <hi>Ochi Chronwi,</hi> whose ambition
swell'd to that height, that he brought four or five hundred <hi>Iaponeses</hi> into the Kingdom,
cloath'd like Merchants, to be imployed to murther the King, and settle him upon the
Throne. This design took no effect during the Kings life, but he being dead, <hi>Ochi Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowi</hi>
seiz'd on the Crown, and caused himself to be proclaimed King. The Son of <hi>Raja
Hapi</hi> had friends sufficient to cast out this Usurper, but he was not fortunate enough to keep
the Crown in his possession, for he was likewise slain, and left it to his younger Brother alive
at this day. 'Tis not long since the King of <hi>Siam</hi> had the satisfaction to have two young
white Elephants together, but they both dyed in a short time.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> do believe that a white Elephant hath something in it of divine, and say,
they respect it not only for the colour, but they observe in him that he looks to be treated
as a Prince, and that he is troubled, when other Elephants render not him the honour due
to him.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Siam</hi> is a <hi>Pagan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King a <hi>Pagan.</hi>
                     </note> nor do his Subjects know any other Religion. They

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47786:248"/>
to do their Devotions. They are discerned from other buildings by the gilt Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Pyramides. There are infinite <hi>Pagodes</hi> of Gold, Silver, Stone, Timber, and other
materials, of all sizes; some of twenty, some thirty, fourty, fifty foot, and amongst the rest
one which sits, which if it stood, would be sixscore foot in height.</p>
                  <p>Their ecclesiasticks are very exemplary in their life,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A</hi> Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> having amongst them a kind of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,</hi>
under the direction of the High-Priest of the Grand <hi>Mosquey</hi> of the City of <hi>India,</hi>
to whom all the rest yield obedience. In matters of Religion his Authority is great, but
in Temporals he acknowledges the King, and yields him the same respect as his other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
do. In the City of <hi>India,</hi> there are above thirty thousand of these Ecclesiasticks;
who are easily known by their habit, for they all wear Garments of a yellow Linnen-cloath,
and have their Crowns shav'd. Amongst them they chuse the most learn'd and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd
for Priests, and to take charge of the <hi>Mosqueys.</hi> These are as Parsons amongst them,
who on Festival dayes preach to the people,<note place="margin">Vow Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, but may quit the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> and sacrifice to their Idols. They are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
the company of Women on pain of being burnt alive: but their Vows are not so
indispensible, but such as have not the gift of Continency are allowed to change their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
every <hi>Mosquey</hi> hath a Convent belonging to it, for entertainment of Priests design'd
for the service, which is regularly said, morning and evening. They live partly on the
Revenue of the <hi>Mosqueys,</hi> and partly on Gratuities given them by the King and Nobility,
in the way of Almes, but they have their chiefest livelihood at the peoples Charge, by beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
every day through the City, like our Friars Mendicants. They have likewise Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Women and <hi>Beguins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Beguins.</note> who are aged, devout Women, who inhabit near the <hi>Mosqueys,</hi>
that they may be present at all the Church-Services; but these make no Vow, nor are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged

                  <p>They believe there is one God,<note place="margin">Their belief</note> who created the Universe, and hath under him divers
other Gods, by whom he governs the World. They believe the Soul is immortal, and
that at its departure out of the Body, it goes either to injoy beatitude, or into eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
having first passed through other Bodies. This is the ground of their Religion,
which, they say, they have received from time immemorable by Tradition of Saints, whom
they have exalted to Deities, and now do part of their Devotions to them. They hold
likewise, that good works will save them, and in particular their Charity, which they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
not to men alone, but to Beasts likewise. And hence it is, that on Festival dayes, the
people bring Birds and Fish hard by the <hi>Mosqueys,</hi> which they buy on purpose to set them
at liberty, because with the <hi>Benjans</hi> they believe a <hi>Metempsychosis,</hi> or transmigration of
Souls.</p>
                  <p>In their Ceremonies they use abundance of lights,<note place="margin">Lights in the <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queys.</hi>
                     </note> which they set up before their <hi>Pagodes,</hi>
in time of Service. They likewise Incense them, and adorn them with Flowers and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones. They have no certain day in the week design'd for their Devotions, but
they have some in particular every quarter of the Moon, and observe moreover a sort of
Lent for three moneths, during which they abstain from several sorts of Meat.</p>
                  <p>They pray for the dead,<note place="margin">Prayers for the dead.</note> and bury them with many Ceremonies. They wash, shave, and
perfume the Corps in the presence of the Ecclesiasticks; then they are brought near the
<hi>Mosqueys,</hi> where the Corps is burnt, and the Ashes buried in the same place, under a rich
Tomb or stately Pyramide, according to the degree and abilities of the deceased. The
nearest Relations shave themselves, give Alms, procure the Priests to say Prayers, and attend
the body with Musick, Theatrical Representations, and Fire-works, so as these Obsequies
put them to great charges.</p>
                  <p>They never dispute with any of a contrary Religion, but believe, that by living well
they may be saved in any Religion: though they are so fixt to their own, that there is no
hope of ever introducing another. The <hi>Portuguez</hi> endeavoured to catechise some, but with

then what are necessary for the Chamber and Kitchin, and their diet is Rice, Fish and
Pulse, and they drink nothing but Water, but at Feasts they make better cheer, and are
willing to be invited to be drunk with <hi>Arac</hi> or Strong-water.</p>
                  <p>Ecclesiasticks meddle not in the marriages of Persons of Quality,<note place="margin">Their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</note> by reason the parties
are content to confide in each other for the conditions agreed upon, and obtaining the
consent of their Parents they consummate the marriage. But they ever reserve liberty of
separation, with an equal division of Goods and Children, without License of any Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and to marry again, with whom, and as oft as they will. Their contract with their
Concubines is of a different kind, for they are considered but as Slaves, and under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Wife, who on her part is satisfied with this precedency, knowing her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who are only esteemed legitimate, shall divide all, leaving to the natural but a very
small share.</p>
                  <p>The Estates of Persons of Quality are ordinarily divided into three parts; one falls to
the King; one to the Ecclesiasticks, they defraying the Funeral Charges, which there are
great; and the third to the Children. People of middle condition buy their Wives, and
consummate the Marriage, after payment of the sum accorded on; but have the same pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of Divorce as the others.</p>
                  <p>Their Children divide the inheritance equally, except the eldest, who hath some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>Till they are five or six years of age,<note place="margin">Education of Children.</note> they bring up their children with little care; then
they put them to the Ecclesiasticks to be taught to write and read and to be instructed in
Religion; during which time they see their children but very seldom; but having learnt
these first Rudiments, they put them to a Trade; or if they find them to be ingenious,
they continue them in their Studies, to make them capable of the Priestly Function, or fit
for some imployments, which among them are bestow'd according to merit, and not sold
for money. Those who live in Cities subsist by Merchandize, turn Courtiers, or betake
themselves to some Handy-craft, or else become Fisher-men, whereof there are very many
along the Coast, as there are also in those Cities, which have the convenience of any River.
The Peasantry is very wretched, living only on their labour, employing themselves in dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

daily commission'd thither, confirming themselves by this means so well in the Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that he not only allows them to trade throughout his Dominions, but imploys them
in his most important Affairs, permitted them to build a Church in his chief City, and
maintains one of their Priests at his own charge. They enjoy'd all these priviledges, till
such time as the King of <hi>Siam</hi> began to favour the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whom he found less insolent
and more sincere then the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> who jealous of the affection of the King shewed to
the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> presently obstructed the Commerce the <hi>Siameses</hi> held at Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> and
<hi>Negapatam,</hi> and proceeded so far, as at last, in the year 1624. they set upon a <hi>Dutch</hi> Frigot
upon the River <hi>Menam,</hi> as we told you before: whereat the King was so offended, that
the Bishop of <hi>Malacca,</hi> having a Vicar Resident at <hi>India,</hi> he forbad him to come to Court.
The <hi>Portuguez</hi> instead of making amends for this first fault, in a conjucture when the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> their profess'd enemies, might have joyn'd with the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> continued
still to obstruct the Commerce of the <hi>Siameses;</hi> in so much that the King perceiving their
design was absolutely to destroy it, was out of all patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the year 1631. stayed
one of their Ships with all the Men; but they finding means to make an escape, contrary
to their parole, he put an Imbargo upon all the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Ships, which were found in the
Ports of <hi>Lygoar</hi> and <hi>Tanassary,</hi> and put all the Men in prison, out of which they were not
set at liberty till two years after.</p>

                  <p>On the North-west side of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> lies that of <hi>Cambodia,</hi> which on the
other side hath nothing but the Sea. The Metropolis, from which it derives its name,
lies sixty Leagues from the Sea, upon a pleasant River, which rises out of a great Lake, as
do also all the other Rivers of the Kingdom. But in that of <hi>Cambodia,</hi> it is particularly
observable, that it overflows every year as the <hi>Nile</hi> doth; and as doth also the River <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi>
in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam.</hi> It begins to rise at the beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> and so rises
by degrees to ten or twelve foot; but in <hi>Iuly</hi> and <hi>August</hi> 'tis not navigable, for that it
drowns the whole Country. The City of <hi>Cambodia,</hi> to prevent these Deluges, is built
upon an advantagious rising, having but onely one street, and is inhabited by <hi>Iaponeses,
Portuguez,</hi> by <hi>Cochinchinez</hi> and <hi>Malayes.</hi> The <hi>Portuguez</hi> carry <hi>Malacca</hi>-Stuffs thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

black, with Ladles and other Utensils of Silver, or Iron, so polished they might be taken for

mentioned; for an Army of twenty five or thirty thousand is the most he can draw into
the Field, so as were the <hi>Siameses</hi> more Martial, they might with small trouble make <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodia</hi>

                  <p>No address is made to the King, but by mediation of these <hi>Ockinas;</hi> for though the
Priests are next his Person, between him and the <hi>Ockinas,</hi> and converse familiarly with him,
they esteem it notwithstanding a king of Sacriledge for an Ecclesiastick to meddle in secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

of which 'tis their Office to take cognizance, as also of the Kings Orders upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
In the whole Town there is but one <hi>Pagode</hi> or <hi>Mosquee,</hi> wherein there are three big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

Continent, on this side the Line two Degrees and half, in a large Plain, where there is but
only one Mountain, the foot whereof is almost wholly taken up with the Town, leaving
only a small space open towards the North-east. About eighteen hundred paces may be
the compass of it; for six hundred whereof it lies on the Sea-coast, enclosed with a good
Wall, as likewise on the River-side, which bounds another third of the Town; and on
the Land-side, 'tis fortified with four regular Bastions. The first, which is on the River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
is called the Bastion of Saint <hi>Domingo;</hi> another on the Sea-shore, Saint <hi>Iago;</hi> and
two more betwixt these two, called <hi>Madre de Dios</hi> and <hi>Vnze mil Vergenes:</hi> from that of

the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> also called Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> which serves likewise for a Parish Church, stands on the
top of the Hill, whence it commands the Town, and the Country near about it. There
is likewise another rising ground about a Cannon shot from the City, where there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of <hi>Iacobins.</hi> The River there, which runs North-west, is not very broad, and at
high-water it mixes with the Sea, but is fresh at low-water. There is a Bridge over it,
though one side is without comparison much higher then the other, by reason the Land,
South-east, is so low and marshy, that it cannot be broken, but water comes in immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,

they came down into <hi>Malacca,</hi> and besieg'd the chief City, upon promise they should be
possest of it; but the aid that King brought them was so inconsiderable, that they were
constrain'd to raise the Siege; yet not till they had so ruin'd the place, that it could never
since be repaired, six thousand lives being lost in the Siege. On the other side, since the

the <hi>Moluques</hi> is quite lost, by reason they are no more Masters of that Sea. But what more
and more ruines the City, is the avatice of the Governours, who will not accept
of that Government, but on condition to inrich themselves two hundred thousand
Crowns in three years: to raise which sum they are forc'd to oppress the Inhabitants as

                  <p>The Inhabitants breed no Swine,<note place="margin">Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</note> but the Forrests are so full of wild ones, that they are
forc'd to hunt them to prevent the destruction of their Rice; which being taken, they
bury them in the ground, as being <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and eat none themselves, nor suffer
others.</p>
                  <p>In the Forrest likewise there are abundance of Tygers and Apes, which are no less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
to the Fields then the wild Swine are; but the wild Elephants, of which there are
likewise great numbers, are very harmless. They are taken by hunting, turning a tame
Elephant amongst them, with whom they presently fight, and while they are in the fury
they tye their hinder feet together; so as being not able to withstand any longer, they
yield to be driven away, and are tam'd by hunger in a short time.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portuguez</hi> heretofore bought there fifteen or sixteen horned Beasts in a year, and
carried them to <hi>Malacca,</hi> paying a <hi>Campan</hi> a head for the export. But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> pay
nothing, neither for those they slaughter in the Country, nor for those they ship for <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>
or <hi>Iava:</hi> for doubtless they win more on their affections then the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> or any
other Strangers.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Patana</hi> is Subject, or rather Vassal to the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> but payes him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
a very inconsiderable Tribute. Not many years since there reign'd a Queen, that
sent him no more then once a year a Flower of Gold, and some Silk-Stuffes and Scarlet;
she was about that time fifty years of age, whereof she had been a Widow fifteen; when
she appear'd abroad, which was seldom, to take the Air, she was attended by four thousand
Persons of Quality, with the Armes and Equipage of her deceased Husband born before
her.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Iohor</hi> possesses all the utmost parts of the <hi>Penninsula,</hi>

<hi>Aurea Chersonesus,</hi> to the Streight of <hi>Sincopura,</hi> the chief Towns are <hi>Linga, Bintam, Cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
&amp;c. but the chief City of all the Country is <hi>Batusabar,</hi> scituate six Leagues from
the Sea, upon the River <hi>Iohor,</hi> divided into two Towns, one keeping the name of <hi>Batusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi>
the other called <hi>Cottasabrang,</hi> one being thirteen hundred paces about, the other about
five hundred. They are both built with Free-stone, and all the Houses stand along the
River-side, raised on piles eight or ten foot from the ground, which lies so low, that at
high-water 'tis covered twice a day. In it are near four thousand Inhabitants able to
bear Armes; and could they bring themselves to take pains in Fortification, with little
labour might this River be brought about the Town, which might thus be made one
of the strongest places in the <hi>Indies.</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have used all their Endeavour to
bring them to it, and to secure themselves from the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> their irreconcileable
Enemy: but their Houses in <hi>Cotta Zabrang,</hi> and thereabouts, being nothing but
Straw, they care not much for burning, so they have but time to save themselves in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tusabar,</hi>
where the building is of Timber, and they can defend themselves against fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parties.</p>
                  <p>The Country belongs intirely to the King,<note place="margin">The soyl fertile.</note> who gives Land to manure to any that desire
it; but the <hi>Malayans</hi> are so slothful, that the Ground is all, as it were, overgrown with
Moss, though by the Herbage and Trees it produces, it is easie to perceive, great profit
might be raised, if the Soyl were cultivated. For further testimony of this, the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
in their Relations, amongst other things observe, that at a time the King of
<hi>Iohor</hi> presented their Admiral with Sugar Canes eighteen foot long, and seven inches

                  <p>The <hi>Malacca</hi> or <hi>Malayan</hi> Language is held the most elegant of all the <hi>Indies,</hi> where it is

                  <p>Leaving the firm Land and the <hi>Peninsula,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sumatra.</note> by the Ancients called <hi>Aurea Chersonesus,</hi> on
the Coast of <hi>Malacca;</hi> we find the Isle of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> not above ten Leagues distant. Some
have said 'twas rent from the Continent by the Sea Currents, as <hi>Ceylon</hi> from that part of
the <hi>Indies</hi> heretofore called <hi>India intra Gangem,</hi> but for this conjecture there is little ground
in History, it being not to be affirmed more of this place, then it can of <hi>Sicily,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi>
or any other Island in the World; except we shall presuppose, that at the Creation the Sea
compassed the whole Earth, and that then there was no Islands, but that they were made
by the Sea, which afterwards by degrees form'd them out of the firm Land. To enter
into this dispute is not our design, no more then to decide whether <hi>Sumatra</hi> were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Taprobane,</hi> as <hi>Ios. de l' Escale, Mercator,</hi> and divers others think; or <hi>Ophir,</hi> where
King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Ships fetch'd the Gold and other precious things, as the Scripture sayes;
but we shall recite only what we could gather out of these last Relations.</p>
                  <p>All conclude that <hi>Sumatra</hi> extends from the fifth degree on this side, to the sixth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
beyond the Line; by which Rule it should contain a hundred and sixty, or a hundred
sixty five Leagues in length, with a breadth of sixty; and so they who inhabit the middle
of the Island, to have the Equinoctial Line perpendicularly over them. By the scituation
we may judge the heats to be there extream; and herewithall there is so much Wood, and
such a multitude of Lakes, that the Air, especially for Strangers, is exceeding unhealthful.
Nevertheless it is abundantly fertile;<note place="margin">The Riches.</note> and besides Gold, Silver, and divers other Metals, as
Copper, Iron, Brass, whereof they have the Art to make as good Artillery as they do in
<hi>Europe;</hi> it produces Rice and Millet, particularly Fruit, in such quantity, as the Forrests
are loaden with it, and sufficiently furnish all the Inhabitants. In the middle of the Isle
there is a burning Mountain, flaming by intermissions, as <hi>Vesuvius</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi>
and, they report, there is a Balsom Fountain running incessantly. 'Tis wealthy in
Diamonds and other precious Stones, Silks, Spices, Wax, Honey, Camphire, Cassia, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other Drugs used in Medicine. There are whole Woods of white <hi>Sandale,</hi> and Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
sufficient to cloath the Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>This Island was heretofore divided into ten Kingdoms,<note place="margin">Contains many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</note> but Men making this Voyage
only for Traffick, they are contended to visit those only next the Sea, and omit to travel fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the Country, where doubtless Riches are to be found unknown to the maritime
Inhabitants. The <hi>Portuguez</hi> give us account only of two Mediterranean Kingdoms, which
they call <hi>Andragidan</hi> and <hi>Arunau;</hi> as also those of <hi>Achim, Pedir, Pacem, Camparam, Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Mancabo,</hi> all on the Sea-side, and on this side the Line. The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for advance of
their Commerce in the Isle of <hi>Iava,</hi> have discovered the Kingdom of <hi>Polymbam</hi> beyond
the Line, and have made there a most firm establishment, as may be seen in their Relations.
The <hi>Portuguez</hi> have there nothing at all, but have freedom of Trade, except hindred by
the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Achim</hi> hath united to his Crown the Kingdoms of <hi>Pedir</hi> and <hi>Pacem,</hi>

<hi>Hollanders</hi> first sailed into those parts, was a Fisher-man that usurp'd the Crown, and, in the
Siege of <hi>Polymbam,</hi> was slain, leaving only one Son of five moneths of age, under the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47786:252"/>
government of his Father in Law. Which young Prince dying, his Grandfather
succeeded to the Crown; and that was he the <hi>Hollanders</hi> treated with in the year
1668.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Achim</hi> stands in a wide Plain upon the side of a very broad River,<note place="margin">The Town of <hi>Achim.</hi>
                     </note> but so
shallow, that the least Boats get in with difficulty. It hath neither Gates nor Walls, the
Houses all built on piles, and covered with <hi>Coco</hi>-leaves. The Castle, or Palace Royal, stands
in the middle of the Town, which on two sides hath most excellent pleasant Forrests, well
stored with Apes, Herns, and all manner of Birds.</p>
                  <p>The Natives are flat-fac'd,<note place="margin">The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</note> and of an Olive colour, they cover their body with a Cotton
or Silk Shirt, and their head with a light Turbant of the same stuffe; Children go stark
naked, only Girls have their secret parts hidden with a Silver-plate. The Inhabitants of
<hi>Guzuratta, Malabar, Negupatam, Bengalan,</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> and all Strangers that live among
them, cloath themselves after the same manner.</p>
                  <p>The Castle is fortified with a good Wall and Pallisado, and well flanked, so as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
commands all the Avenues and streets of the Town. The Houses in the Castle are
built of the same matter and same form of those of the Town, by reason the River, which
often overflows, drowns them sometimes to the first story. The piles that support them
are gayly wrought, and the Houses covered with Canes. They enter into the Castle by
seven Gates, one within another, which are neither curious nor strong. Without the
Kings special Licence, none but the Life-guard and Women enter the Pallisado, all others
must sue for Audience, or expect till the King sends for them. Such as present themselves
to him, do him reverence, with their hands joyn'd and lifted above their head, crying,

governs by four <hi>Sabanders,</hi> who are next in authority to him. His Laws are fevere, and
punishments extreamly cruel; so as one shall there meet a multitude of people without
either hands or feet, and have been so mutilated, for miscarriages not worth the name of
Crimes.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Religion.</note> as almost all that inhabit the Coast of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> is a <hi>Mahumetan;</hi>
for which reason I shall not need to say any more of their Religion; only, that they begin
their Lent with the new Moon in the twelfth moneth, and end it, at the new of the next
moneth, observing abstinence all day, during that time, till night. Whence it comes, that
their impatience to see the end of their Lent, makes them still gaze in the West, fixing their
eyes up to the Heavens, to find the new Moon; which is no sooner seen, but they fall to
feasting and jollity for the remainder of that night.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Sumatra</hi> they get no Corn,<note place="margin">Their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals.</note> but Rice sufficient, of which the Inhabitants make good
varieties, particularly Cakes with Oyl; they have plenty likewise of Beef and Buffles,
Goat and Mutton, though none but the King hath priviledge to breed Sheep. Oranges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>There is in <hi>Sumatra</hi> a Tree, in the <hi>Malayan</hi> Language called <hi>Singadi;</hi> in <hi>Arabia, Gurae;</hi>
the <hi>Canarians</hi> call it <hi>Parizaticco;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day-tree.</note> the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Turks, Gul;</hi> the <hi>Decanins, Pul;</hi> and the
<hi>Portuguez, Arbor triste de dia.</hi> It puts forth an infinite number of branches very small
and full of knots, from every knot comes two leaves like a Plumb-leaf, save that they are
as sweet as Sage, and are covered with a beautiful white. Every leaf hath its bud, which
opening thrusts forth small heads, whereof each hath four round leaves, and from each
head comes five flowers, composing as it were a Nosegay, in such manner as the fifth is
seen in the middle of the rest. The flowers are white as Snow, and a little bigger then
the Orange-flower; blows immediately as the Sun is set, so suddenly, that they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
as 'twere in the cast of an eye. This fecundity lasts all night, till the return of the
Sun makes both the flowers and leaves drop off, and so strips the tree that least green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is not to be found upon it, nor any thing of that admirable odour which perfum'd the
Air, and comprehended all that <hi>Asia</hi> affords of sweetness. The tree keeps in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till the Sun hath left the Horizon; and then it begins to open its womb again, and deck
it self with fresh flowers, as if in the shades of night it would recover it self out of the
affliction which it is put into by that Planet, whose return enlivens the rest of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
                  <p>There is not in the Island a Tree more common then the <hi>Cocoes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cocoes.</note> and in regard 'tis gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
through the <hi>Indies,</hi> I will give here a brief description of it; and first tell you there are
four sorts thereof. That which bears the fruit called <hi>Cocoes,</hi> which are the Nuts of the
Country, is the most considerable, not only of any Tree in this Country, but indeed of any
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47786:252"/>
other part of the world. This Tree, not above a foot diameter, grows in body exceeding
high, having not a branch but at the top, where it spreads as the Date-tree. The fruit
comes not out of the branches, but beneath out of the body, in bunches or clusters of ten
or twelve Nuts: The flower is like that of a Chesnut, and it grows only near the Sea, or
upon the River side in sandy ground, and nevertheless grows so lofty, that except the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
who by practice climb it with as much agility and quickness as an Ape, there is no
Stranger will venture to do it. 'Tis as common in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as the Olive in <hi>Spain,</hi> or
Willows in <hi>Holland;</hi> and though the wood be sappy, yet it serves for such variety of things,
that there is no Tree of so general an use.<note place="margin">Ships made of it, as also Sails, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> In the <hi>Maldives</hi> Isles, they make Ships that
cross the Sea, without any thing but what the <hi>Cocoe</hi> affords. Of the outer rind they make
a kind of Hemp, which they call <hi>Cayro,</hi> whereof they make Cordage and Cables for their
Ships. Of the leaves they make Sails, and cover Houses with them; they make of them
likewise Umbrelloes, Fans, Tents, Mats and Hats, which for their lightness are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
in Summer.</p>
                  <p>These Trees are planted either for the Fruit, or the <hi>Terry</hi> which is got out of them.
The Fruit is of the bigness of an Estridge egg; and the Husk, that is green, as of our
ordinary Nuts, being dried, is converted into the Thread called <hi>Cayro,</hi> which I spoke of
before. Sometimes they gather the Fruit before it comes to perfect maturity, and then
it is called <hi>Lanbo,</hi> whence may be drawn two pints of refreshing Liquor pleasant to
drink. This Juyce by degrees turns to a little Nut, in taste not much unlike our Hasel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut,
but something sweeter. The shell of this Nut, while 'tis green, is good to eat, but
being dry, they make Cups, Spoons, and other Utensils of it, or make Coal for Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths.
The <hi>Indians</hi> peel this Nut, and extract a Milk out of it, as useful to all purposes,
as our Cows milk. None but the poor eat the Fruit, because ordinarily they dry it, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the Oyl, which is good to eat, useful in medicine, and to burn in Lamps. The fruit
being kept in the shell, by degrees turns to a kind of Apple, which in time grows yellow,
and is excellent to eat.</p>
                  <p>They extract Wine out of it, thus;<note place="margin">How they make Wine.</note> pulling off the Flower, they fasten to it a pot of
Earth they call <hi>Collao,</hi> well stop'd and luted with Potters earth, that it may not dye nor
sharpen. They know in what time the pot will be filled with a certain Liquor, which
they call <hi>Sura,</hi> that hath the taste and quality of Whey. This Liquor boyl'd makes <hi>Terry,</hi>
which serves them for Wine, and being set in the Sun, makes excellent Vinegar, and stilling
it in a Limbeck makes good Strong-water. They make likewise Sugar of it, which they
call <hi>Iagra,</hi> but esteem it not, for that 'tis brown, having such plenty of white. The <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez,</hi>
steeping Raisins of the Sun and some other Ingredients in <hi>Sura,</hi> make a Drink that
hath the taste and quality of Sack.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> esteem most the inside of this Tree,<note place="margin">Paper of this <hi>Tree.</hi>
                     </note> for the Pith is white, and as fine as
any Paper we have, will hold in fifty or sixty folds, or as many leaves. They term it <hi>Olla,</hi>
and use it in stead of Paper, so as Persons of Quality seek much after it, only for this use;
of the Bark they make courser paper, to make up Merchandizes in.</p>
                  <p>The second Species of <hi>Cocoes,</hi> is the Tree that the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Arrequeiro,</hi> for the
<hi>Areca</hi> that comes of it, whereof we spoke in the precedent Book, and of which we shall
have further occasion to speak more hereafter; as well as of the other two kinds, called
<hi>Tamor</hi> and <hi>Lantor,</hi> in the description of the Isle of <hi>Iava,</hi> to which we shall come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bananas</hi> is not any where so common as in <hi>Sumatra:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bananas.</note> 'tis a kind of <hi>Indian</hi> Fig-tree,
which grows to a mans height, and produces Leaves six foot long, and a foot and half
broad. We call it, with the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> the Fig-tree, in regard that though the Fruit be
not altogether like other Figs, yet hath it the shape and colour. It may be called rather a
Bush then a Tree, because it hath no body. The Leaves begin to break forth when the
Sprout is but four foot high, and as some come forth, others wither and fall, till the Plant
be at full growth, and the Fruit come to maturity. The bole of it is not above ten or twelve
inches think, and so soft that it may with ease be cut with a Knife. In the middle of the
Leaf there comes out a Flower as big as an Estridge Egg, inclining to a violet colour, out of
which comes a branch which is not wood, but tender as a Cabbage-stalk, loaden with Figs.
At first they are no bigger then a Bean, but in time they grow seven or eight inches long,
and as big as a Cowcumber; not a sprig but shall have near a hundred Figs, which joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
like a bunch of Grapes. They gather them before they are full ripe, which they
know by their colour, which is of a yellowish green; then they hang them on a Nail till
they ripen, which will be in four or five days. No stalk hath more then one bunch; they
cut it close to the ground, whence it springs again with such vigout, that in a moneth it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
its former condition; and at that rate fructifies the year throughout, which is a great

The Cods or Husks, wherein the Figs are inclosed, are no less delicious and useful then the
Fruit it self, and as nourishing as our finest Bread, and in taste much like a Cake, so as this
Tree alone is sufficient to feed the whole Country.</p>
                  <p>The Pepper of <hi>Sumatra</hi> is without doubt the best in the <hi>Indies,</hi>

Commonly they plant it at the root of another Tree, underset it with Canes or Poles, as
Hop or <hi>French</hi>-beans. The Leaves resemble Orange-leaves, only they are a little less and
more sharp; it grows in little branches as red Goosberries, or Juniper. While it hangs on
the tree it is green, and turns not black till it be gathered and dry, which they do in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
and <hi>Ianuary.</hi> The places which produce most of it are, <hi>Malabar, Onar, Barselor, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galor,
Calicut, Cranganor, Cochim, Conhon, Quida, Dampin, Dedir, Campir</hi> and <hi>Andragir,</hi>
the Isles of <hi>Sumatra</hi> and <hi>Bantam,</hi> and certain places in the Isle of <hi>Iava.</hi> They bring forth
likewise white Pepper, but not in so great abundance. The <hi>Malayans</hi> call Pepper <hi>Lauda;</hi>
the Inhabitants of <hi>Iava, Sahargh;</hi> and the <hi>Malabars, Molanga.</hi> Long Pepper is not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
but in <hi>Bengala,</hi> which is another sort of Fruit like the tag of a point, but something
thicker and gray, containing a small white grain of the same taste and use as common Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
In <hi>Malabar</hi> and <hi>Goa</hi> there grows another sort of Pepper, which they call <hi>Canarius,</hi>
but used only by poor people.</p>
                  <p>'Tis something strange, but very certain, that they spend more Pepper in the <hi>Indies</hi> then
is brought into <hi>Europe;</hi> though in the Haven of <hi>Bantam</hi> only, 'tis known they have laded
fourty eight thousand Bags in a year: for the <hi>Indians</hi> dress not any meat without hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls

dis-joyned, only by a narrow Streight, called the Streight of <hi>Sunda.</hi> It lies seven Degrees
beyond the Line, and is about fifty Leagues long: but hitherto no mans curiosity hath
discovered the breadth of it, which makes some conceive that it is not an Island, but part
of the Continent, known by the name of <hi>Terra Australis,</hi> near the Streight of <hi>Magellan.
Iulius Scaliger,</hi> in his Exercitations against <hi>Cardan,</hi> calls it the <hi>Compendium of the World;</hi>
because there is not Animal, Plant, Fruit, Metal, nor Drug, which is not here in greater
abundance, then in any part of the Universe.</p>
                  <p>The Natives say,<note place="margin">Inhabitant.</note> that originally they came from <hi>China,</hi> and that their Ancestors, weary
of the yoak that King kept them under, removed to the Isle of <hi>Iava;</hi> certainly they are

divers <hi>Chineses</hi> settle in this Island.</p>
                  <p>There is scarce a Town in <hi>Iava</hi> but hath a particular King, who not above forty or
fifty years since obeyed all one Emperour, but of late they have shaken off that Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and are all independent. The King of <hi>Bantam</hi> is the most puissant,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Bantam.</hi>
                     </note> and next him the
King of <hi>Palambuam,</hi> from whom is denominated the Streight that divides the Isles

                  <p>Near <hi>Panarucan</hi> there is a Mountain of Sulphur, which began in the year 1586. to cast
up fire in such violence,<note place="margin">A flaming Mount.</note> that at that first blazing above ten thousand persons perished by it.

Five Leagues onwaads West stands <hi>Iapara,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Japara.</note> upon a skirt of Land that thrusts it self
three Leagues into the Sea. The scituation of this Town is upon a fair River, with a

none of the meanest in the Island.</p>
                  <p>Twenty five Leagues from <hi>Iapara,</hi> and forty five from <hi>Bantam,</hi> lies <hi>Matram,</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavam,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then five Leagues West from <hi>Iapara</hi> is the City of <hi>Pati,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Without question this last is the Metropolis, and most considerable City of all <hi>Iava,</hi>
scituate about twenty five Leagues from the Isle of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> at the foot of a Mountain,
whence three Rivers rise, two whereof run by the walls, the other through the City, but
all too shallow for Navigation. The Town is indifferent great, but rascally Houses; the
walls, which are of Brick, and three foot in thickness, are not entirely lined with Earth, yet
so flanked, that at every hundredth pace lies a Cannon, which would sufficiently secure the
Curtain, were it in condition for service; but their Artillery is not mounted, and they
have no other Ammunition then a little Powder brought from <hi>Malacca,</hi> where the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi>
have a Mill. The City Gates are so wretched, that one might beat them down with
a Club; but so vigilantly guarded, 'twould be hard to approach without notice; there
are neither Bastions nor Towers, but in lieu thereof Scaffolds of three stories, which yield
a strong defence.</p>
                  <p>In the whole City there are but three principal Streets,<note place="margin">The Kings Palace.</note> which all abut upon the Castle
called <hi>Pacebam.</hi> The one goes from the <hi>Pacebam</hi> to the Haven; another, where the
Slaves and the Kings Domesticks inhabit, leads to the Gate towards the Fields; and the
third, to the Gate at the foot of the Mountain. The Streets are not pav'd, but are as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
by means of the Sand they are covered with. The Channels, which in divers
places cross the City, are foul and stinking, by reason the Stream of the River not being
strong enough to carry away the filth it brings it self, and what is thrown forth, the Water
choaks and makes puddles that infect the whole City. No Person of Quality who hath
not his private Chappel, or Mesquite, in his House; but one there is in common, near
the Palace, on the Magazine and Stable side. The City is divided into several Posts,
each of which is assign'd to some Person of Quality, who commands in time of War,
and hath the direction in civil Affairs.<note place="margin">A Drum for a Clock.</note> They have a Drum as big as those <hi>Germane</hi>
Casks, call'd Thunder-bolts, used instead of a Bell, which they beat with a wooden
Bar as big as a Weavers-beam, morning and evening, as also on Alarms. Likewise
they have Brass basins, which they beat musically and chime upon, as they do on
Bells.</p>
                  <p>At every corner of the Streets there stands a Guard,<note place="margin">The Guard of the town.</note> and at Sun-set they draw up and
make fast all Passage-boats, so as in the night there is no stirring in the Street. At the
Prison gate, near the Palace, stands a Guard of fifty Men; nor is there a Person of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
who hath not one of ten or twelve at his House. The Town is full of <hi>Cocoe</hi>-trees,
nor is there a Mansion without divers belonging to it. The housing is poorly built, of
Straw or Reeds upon piles, made like those at <hi>Achim.</hi> They cover their Houses with <hi>Cocoe</hi>-leaves,
and the sides of thier lodging Rooms have only Curtains for freedom of the Air,
which is exceeding necessary in this hot Climate. For preservation of their Wares, they
have Store-houses of Stone, but they are covered only with Straw, so that to secure them
from fire, which is but too frequent amongst them, they lay great pieces of Timber over
the Roof, and cover it with Sand, that the fire may not find passage. The Rooms in their
Houses are only divided by partitions, made of Canes called <hi>Bambus,</hi> which they slit so
thin, that a Horse-load serves for all the Rooms in a House. At the Houses of Persons of
Quality, at the first entrance, you come into a square Court, where the Guard is, and where
the Master of the House speaks with such as have business with him, under a little Shed,
covered with Canes or <hi>Cocoe</hi>-leaves. In one of the corners of this Court stands the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite,</hi>
where at noon they do their Devotions, and not far thence the Cistern where they
wash themselves. Being entred the House, you find on both sides of a narrow Gallery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
little Niches, for Slaves to rest in, who watch for their Masters security; by reason
they are all afraid of being surprized and killed by their Enemies in the night. All For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47786:254"/>
as the Inhabitants of <hi>Bengala, Guzuratta, Malayans, Abissins, Chineses, Portuguez</hi>
and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> lye out of Town.</p>
                  <p>Here are three great Market places,<note place="margin">Market places.</note> where Merchants meet daily; The grand <hi>Bazar,</hi> or
Exchange, is towards the East part of the Town, and is the meeting place of forreign
Merchants; as <hi>Portuguez, Arabians, Turks, Chineses, Quilins, Peguans, Malayans, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galans,
Gusurats, Malabars,</hi> and other <hi>Indians,</hi> who are there from the break of the day
till nine of the clock, and then break up. The second Market place is before the great
<hi>Mesquite,</hi> divided from it by a Pallisado. To this place Women resort with Sacks, and a
weight of three pounds, they call <hi>Gantam,</hi> who buy Pepper of the Country people, at eight
or nine hundred <hi>Caxas</hi> the <hi>Gantam.</hi> But the <hi>Chineses,</hi> who are very skilful in this Trade,
forestall them sometimes; for they go to the Peasants and buy all they have by the lump
before hand. Betwixt the Pallisado and the <hi>Mesquite</hi> stand Women that sell <hi>Bettele,
Araca, Bananas, Melons,</hi> &amp;c. and some there are sell fine Cakes to be eaten hot.</p>
                  <p>A little higher on the right hand are Armourers,<note place="margin">Armourers.</note> who sell small pieces of Cannon, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols,
Sword-blades, Battle-axes, Knives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not far thence, there are others that sell
Sandal-wood, white and yellow, and on the left hand are Confectioners, that sell Sugar,
Honey, and all sorts of Sweet-meats liquid or dry. Near to that is the Bean-market, where
are sold all sorts of Beans, black, white, red, yellow, green and grey, at three hundred <hi>Caxas</hi>
the <hi>Gantam.</hi> Next to this is the Onyon-market, where Merchants that sell Cloath by
whole-sale come, and such as deal in return of Money, and assurances of the return of Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.
Hard by this is the Poultry, where, besides tame Fowl, they sell also Kids, Geese,
Pigeons, Parrats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Coming thence you meet three wayes; one going to the <hi>Chineses</hi>
Shops; another to the Herb and Pulse-market; and the third to the Shambles. <hi>By</hi> the
way to the <hi>Chineses</hi> Shops, on the right hand, are some Jewellers, who for the greater part
are <hi>Choroacones,</hi> that is, <hi>Persians,</hi> or <hi>Arabians,</hi> who sell <hi>Rubies, Hiacinths, Turquesses, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats,</hi>
&amp;c. And on the left hand is the place for the <hi>Bengalians,</hi> with their Toyes and small
Wares.</p>
                  <p>On the backside of this Street, the <hi>Chineses</hi> sell their Silks raw and colour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, Damask,
Velvet, Sattins, Brocadoes of Gold and Silver, Purcelane, and Cabinets, and works of
Lacque, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By the way to the Hearb-market, upon the right hand upon the Strand, are
the <hi>Bengalians</hi> with their small Wares. On the left hand Merchants of Linnen-cloath,
and at the lower end of this Market married Women have Seamsters shops; but men are
forbidden to come there under pain of a forfeiture. Then you come to the Hearb-market,
where are a multitude of Simples unknown to us. Turning thence you see the Fish-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
then the Shambles, with Stalls full of Beef, Buffles and Venison: then the Spice-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
where Women sell Pepper, Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all sorts of Gums and
Drugs, to <hi>Europeans</hi> unknown: and the Rice-market, where likewise they sell Earthen-Ware
and Salt; whence they pass by the same way they came, to the place where Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and Masters of Ships meet about their Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The sale of these Commodities lasts but till nine of the clock, and then opens the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
before the <hi>Pacebam,</hi> or Palace Royal, where are sold all sorts of Victuals, as likewise
some Pepper, which they truck with the <hi>Chineses.</hi> About noon the Market in the <hi>Chineses</hi>
quarters begins, where nothing is sold but for the Table.</p>
                  <p>We told you before, that next <hi>Bantam, Tuban</hi> or <hi>Tubaon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tuban.</note> is the chiefest Town in <hi>Iava,</hi>
and in effect, is stronger then all the rest, and although not so great as <hi>Bantam,</hi> 'tis at least
as handsome, and as well built. The Palace is exceeding spacious, and hath very fair
Appartments, where Elephants and other Beasts have their several quarters. Each Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
hath his lodge built upon four pillars, with a post in the middle to tye him to. The
rooms are filled with Chests and Hampers for the baggage, when the King goes his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress.
Near to his Lodgings is a place where his fighting Cocks are kept, every one his
Pen apart, and every one his Keeper; as likewise the Parrots, which are much before those
they bring into these parts. The greatest part of a beautiful flame colour, with a great
golden spot on the back: the out-sides of their wings blew and red, and the in-side a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carnation. They are too tender to indure the inconveniences of a long Voyage; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the <hi>Indians</hi> highly esteem them, for that they love their owners, and delight to be
made much of by them. The King of <hi>Tuban,</hi> whom the <hi>Hollanders</hi> saw, in their third
Voyage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> delighted much in these Creatures, as likewise in Dogs, Horses and
white Ducks, by much larger then ours. He had four legitimate Wives, six Sons, and
two Daughters, besides natural Children a great number by Concubines, which he kept
in several Appartments. His Bed was raised some distance from the ground, built like an
Altar of great Stones, whereon lay a Quilt and certain Pillows of Sattin, filled with raw
Silk.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:47786:254"/>
The Chief Commerce they have at <hi>Tubaon</hi> consists in Pepper, which they carry to the
Isle of <hi>Body,</hi> where they truck for Cloath, and Stuffs of Cotton and Silk, which afterwards
they bring to <hi>Banda, Ternate,</hi> the <hi>Philippines,</hi> and other parts, to truck for Cloves, Mace and
Nutmegs. The Inhabitants, for the greatest part live only on Fish. They wear no other
Garment then a Linnen-cloath about the Loyns; only persons of Quality sometimes have
loose Coats of Chamelot, which reach but to their Thighs. They are by this habit distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from other persons, and by their train of Slaves, without whom they never come
abroad. They delight much in Horses, and to have their Saddles exceeding rich, which
are made like our great Saddles, and their trappings studded with Gold and Silver, striving
to appear well mounted at Assemblies, and to shew the King their horsemanship, and the
nimbleness of their Horses.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants that live in the inner parts of the Isle of <hi>Iava</hi> are <hi>Pagans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Javi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans.</note> and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> believing a transmigration of the Soul; for which reason they eat
neither Fish nor Flesh. Towards the South part of the Isle, there are, though but few,
some <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> as we said before, and they observe the <hi>Turkish</hi> Religion in all things,
sending for Priests to <hi>Meca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They observe two Fasts.<note place="margin">Fasts.</note> The greater of the two begins the fifth of <hi>August,</hi> and at the
beginning of this Lent it is, the Slaves renue their submission to their Master, with Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
extraordinary. For they take them by the feet, and rub them upward to the
knees; then closing their hands, they rub the head, face and neck; and then unclose them
again.</p>
                  <p>Leut being ended,<note place="margin">Divers Wives.</note> they celebrate Easter, entertaining their Children and all their Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks
with a Dinner. There is scarce a Man in <hi>Bantam,</hi> who hath not three or four
Wives, and some have ten or twelve, besides Concubines, who wait on their Wives especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when they go abroad. They make no difference betwixt legitimate and natural
Children. A Father hath not power to sell his Child, though he had it by a Slave.
Children go stark naked, only the Girls cover their Privities with a thin plate of Gold or
Silver.<note place="margin">Tourg <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</note> They marry at the age of eight, nine, or ten years, not only to prevent the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
which in this hot Climate were inevitable, but because the King is Heir to all, who
dying, leave their Children under age; whom he makes his Slaves, as he doth the Widow
and Family of the deceased. The Dowry Persons of Quality give with their Daughters
consists in Slaves of both Sexes, and in a sum of <hi>Coxas,</hi> which is very considerable, when
it amounts to three hundred thousand, which is much about two Crowns and a half <hi>French</hi>
money.</p>
                  <p>The Women appear with great decency at the marriage of their Relations, though
they use no great ceremonies. One may know the day by certain Poles which are stuck in
the Houses of the Bride and Bridegroom, with Tassels of red and white Cotton.</p>
                  <p>Dinner ended, they bring a Horse to the Bridegroom, whereon he rides about the Town
till evening, expecting the slaves he is to have in marriage, who come commonly loaden
with Presents. None but the nearest Kindred sup with them, and see the new married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
abed.</p>
                  <p>Women of Quality are kept in such restraint, that they suffer not their own Sons to
come within their Chambers; and when they go abroad, which is very seldom, all give
place and respect to them, even the King himself would do it: nor dares any man speak
to a married Woman without the leave of her Husband. Women of Quality are known
from others, only by their Train; for all are dressed after the same fashion, wearing a Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoat
of Cotton or Silk, which comes from the Breast to the mid-leg. Stockings they
have none, and go all bare-headed, tying up their Hair together on the Crown of their
Head; but when they come to Weddings, or other publick Assemblies, they wear a Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of Gold, and have on their Fingers and about their Arms Rings and Bracelets. They
are so much addicted to cleanliness, that there passes not a day but they bathe themselves
three or four times. They do not their natural necessities, nor receive their benevolences
from their Husbands, but they go up to the Neck in Water to cleanse themselves: They
do no work at all, which needs be no wonder, for the Husbands themselves having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
two or three hours about their Merchandize, all the day after do nothing but chew
<hi>Bettele</hi> amongst their Wives, who are most sollicitous, by all the little kindnesses they can

                  <p>The Kings Council meets upon Affairs of State,<note place="margin">The Kings Councel.</note> under a broad spread Tree, by Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
where sometimes there come near five hundred persons, who part not till the Moon
go down. When the Council is risen they go to bed, and there lye till dinner time:
afterwards the Councellours of State give audience to all who have ought to propose to
the Councel. When the King comes there in person, he sits in the midst of them; or
else with the four principal Ministers of State, and propounds the point wherein he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
their advice, or causes the Governour of the Town to propound it. To a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of War they call the three hundred Captains, Commanders of the Troops the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
consist of, which is raised in the Town it self. They have a particular course for
quenching fire, which happens but too often among them; for the Women have this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
imposed upon them, while the Men stand in Arms to defend them in the mean time
from pillage.</p>

Grandees are past. Their ordinary wear is of Stuff wrought with Silk, and they wear
Turbants of a fine <hi>Bengalian</hi> Cloath. Some amongst them wear Mandillions of Velvet,
black or crimson, and never forget the Dagger or Poyniard under their Girdle. They ever
go with a numerous train of Slaves; one amongst them carrying the <hi>Bettele</hi>-bottle, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Chamber-pot, and a third the Umbrello. They all go bare-footed, it being thought
a disparagement among them, to walk with Shooes through the Town. In their Houses
many wear them; they are made at <hi>Achim, Malacca</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> and the Isle of <hi>Sumatra,</hi>
where are also made most part of the Umbrello's used in the <hi>Indies.</hi>

                     </note> self-conceited, perfidious, mischievous, and cruel; who never
fail to make an end of such they once get advantage of; and having once committed a
murther, they kill all in their power; for knowing death to be their inevitable reward,
they discharge their fury indifferently on all they encounter, without consideration of sex
or age; so as sometimes they are constrained to kill them in the place, instead of taking
them to be delivered up into the hands of Justice.</p>
                  <p>They generally wear long hair, are of a Chesnut Complexion, having great Jaw-bones,
flat Faces, great Eyebrows, little Eyes, thin Beards; and being of a middle stature, well set,
and strongly limb'd. They are addicted naturally to theft, and so vindicative, that to be
revenged of an Enemy, they stick not to run upon his Weapons, and hazard an assured
death, to take away anothers life.</p>
                  <p>This bloudy disposition shews they have courage,<note place="margin">Good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> and would make good Souldiers, were
they but as dextrous at Fire-arms as they are at their usual Weapons; which are the Pike,
the Battle-axe, and the broad Sword, but above all the Dagger, or Poyniard. Their Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
are of Wood, or boyled Leather stretcht upon a Hoop; and for their bodies they have
Cuirasses, the pieces being fastned together with mails of Iron. Souldiers in time of peace
have no pay, but in time of war they have Arms and Clothes, and Rice and Fish for provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
They are all Slaves, and not only such as belong to the King, but likewise to other
Lords, who are obliged to enroll them for their Princes service. They are seldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
idle, but imploy themselves most commonly in making Sheaths for Ponyards of Sandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
made hollow, or pollishing their Arms, which they generally poyson; keeping them
so well, that no Raizor can be sharper then their Swords. The <hi>Iavaneses,</hi> as indeed all the
rest of the <hi>Indians,</hi> hold their Daggers so dear to them, that they will not speak to any
man without that by their side, not one Brother with another, and at night they lay it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Bolster. Some use Truncks, through which they blow little poysoned Arrows,
so bearded, that pulling it out the head remains in the wound, which by this means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
incurable and mortal. Amongst such a multitude of Villains, there are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
some honest people, but the number is very small: for except some that inhabit
near <hi>Bantam,</hi> upon the Streight of <hi>Sunda,</hi> at the foot of the mountain <hi>Gonon Besar,</hi> who
were transplanted thither from <hi>Pasaruan,</hi> all the rest are depraved. The people not able to

get their livelyhood. The Woman slaves keep market, where they sell their Masters
Pepper, and other Commodities; or else imploy themselves in sewing, or making Cloath,
that they may not live unprofitably. When they have a mind to be eased of them, they
lead them from Port to Port,<note place="margin">How they imploy their Slaves.</note> and sell them to him will give most. The ordinary price
for one of an able body is five <hi>Fardos,</hi> that is about a Pistol a-piece. The Children of a

                  <p>The Pepper which the <hi>Iavians</hi> sell to Strangers is usually mixt with Ordure, black
Sand, or Gravel, or they adulterate it some other way, either in quality or weight, as they
do all their other Commodities. They keep a trade with all the neighbouring Islands,
with notable advantage. At the Towns of <hi>Macasser</hi> and <hi>Surubya</hi> they fetch Rice, which
there they buy for one <hi>Sata de Caxa</hi> the <hi>Gantan,</hi> and sell it for double the price. At <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lambuam</hi>
they buy <hi>Cocoes,</hi> a thousand <hi>Caxes</hi> the hundred, and venting them by retail at
<hi>Bantam,</hi> they sell eight <hi>Cocoes</hi> for two hundred <hi>Caxes.</hi> There they likewise buy the Oyl
of the same Fruit. At <hi>Ioartam, Gerrici Pati,</hi> and <hi>Iuama,</hi> they fetch Salt at a hundred

worth a thousand <hi>Caxaes.</hi> They carry Salt to <hi>Sumatra,</hi> where they truck for Lacque,
Pepper, Benjamin, Cotton, Tortoise-shell, and divers others Commodities. From <hi>Iacatra,

the bark of a Tree, the Letters ingrav'd with a Bodkin, and they make it up in a Roll, or

they know not the Art of Printing, but they paint their own Characters exactly well,

they have had leisure enough to see their error; for in a short time, the Island was so filled

                  <p>As concerning the Trees and Fruits in the Isle of <hi>Iava,</hi> amongst others there is the

of <hi>Cocoe,</hi> but not so great, nor the leaves so big and broad. The Fruit is like a Date; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
incloses it in a husk, which opens not till it flower, and when it ripens, the shell falls off,
the fruit remaining at the branch. It hath scarce any taste, but it moistens the mouth, dyes
the lips red, and the teeth black. The <hi>Indians</hi> lap it up in a <hi>Bettle</hi>-leaf, mix a little Chalk
or Lime with it, and chew it rather out of custom then for any pleasure, though they hold
that it strengthens the Stomach and Gums, and is a topical Medicine against the Scurvy;
and in effect there is scarce an <hi>Indian</hi> that is subject to this Disease, or troubled with the
Tooth-ach. This Drug will make some people to be drunk, that all things seem to turn

                  <p>The <hi>Mangas</hi> grow on Trees not much unlike our Nut-trees,<note place="margin">Mangas.</note> but they have not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Crescent, of a light green, drawing a little towards the red. It hath a great shell, that
encloses an Almond of greater length then breadth, and eaten raw very distasteful, but
roasted on the Coals not unpleasant. 'Tis useful in Physick, against the Worms, and
the <hi>Diarrhaea.</hi> It ripens in <hi>October, November,</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> and being perfectly ripe, 'tis
full as good as a Peach. They get them while they are green, and put them up in Salt,
Vinegar, and Garlick, and then they call them <hi>Mangas d' Achar,</hi> and they serve in stead
of Olives. There are likewise wild ones, which they call <hi>Mangas brauas,</hi> of a pale green
too, but brighter then the other, and full of juyce, which is immediate death without a

for which reason the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> who met with this fruit first in <hi>Brasil,</hi> called it <hi>Pinas:</hi> but
'tis tender and easie to cut. They are yellow within, of a delicate scent, they are eaten in
Wine, but the excess is dangerous for Feavers. The juyce is so sharp, that if one wipe not
the Knife they are cut with, next morning it will be found eaten. The Tree is so apt to
grow, that a sprig will take root in the earth, though it have not past two or three leaves,
be half withered, and have been cut fifteen dayes before. The <hi>Canarins</hi> call this fruit <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasa;</hi>

in scent and taste. At distance they look like Hartichoaks, only they are not so picked as
the leaves of that Plant. The stalk is like that of a Thistle, and every stalk bears but one,
and that at the top of it; for though many times it puts forth at the side other stems, yet
the fruit that comes of them is very small, and seldom comes to maturity. They have of
them in <hi>March,</hi> and then they are very pleasant, for the juyce hath the taste of sweet or
new Wine; and is exceeding easie of digestion, but it heats, and often brings a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Iava</hi> there is another fruit called <hi>Samaca,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Samaca.</note> 'tis as big as a Citron, the colour green,
something drawing to a red; full of juyce, that is tart and toothsom, and within hath
divers black kernels: the leaves are like those of Lemmon-trees, but not so long. They
put them up in Salt or Sugar, and use them as <hi>Tamarindes,</hi> against burning Feavers, Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of the Breast, and pains in the Stomack, and Fluxes.</p>
                  <p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47786:257"/>
as soon as the Sun is set, the leaves close up the fruit, to preserve it from the Dew, and open
as soon as that Planet appears again. The fruit at first is green, but ripening it becomes of
a dark grey, drawing towards a red, inclosed in husks, brown or tawny, of taste a little
bitter, like our Prunelloes. Every husk contains three or four little Beans in a certain
skin, which is that the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Tamarinho.</hi> The fruit is viscous, and sticks to the
fingers, but of so good a taste, that the <hi>Indians</hi> use it almost in all Sawces, as we do Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juyce;
but 'twould turn a mans stomack to see them cook Meat with this Drug; for
squeezing it between their hands, the juyce that runs through their fingers looks more
like a Medicine then a Sawce. These Trees bear twice in the year, and grow every where
without being planted, or otherwise looked after. Physitians use this Drug against burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Feavers, heat of the Liver, and Diseases in the Spleen, and infused a night in cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it purges gently. The <hi>Tamarinds</hi> brought to our parts, are either salted or preserved
in Sugar. The Inhabitants of the Isle of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> where there grows plenty of it,
call it <hi>Quille,</hi> and the <hi>Iavians, Sunda assu.</hi> The <hi>Portuguez</hi> gave it the name of <hi>Tamarin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi>
for the resemblance the fruit holds with the Date in <hi>Arabia,</hi> called <hi>Tamar,</hi> as if they
would say, Dates of <hi>India.</hi> The <hi>Malabars</hi> call it <hi>Puli,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Indians, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli.</hi>
The Tree is as big as a Walnut-tree, full of leaves, bearing its fruit at the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
like the Sheath of a Knife, but not so straight, rather bent like a Bow. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
when they would transport their <hi>Tamarinds,</hi> take them out of the husks, and
make them up in Balls as big as a Mans fist, unhandsome to look on, and worse to
handle.</p>
                  <p>We told you before,<note place="margin">Tabaxir.</note> that 'tis common to plant Pepper near to a sort of Canes, by the
<hi>Iavians</hi> called <hi>Mambu,</hi> in which the <hi>Tabaxir</hi> is found. 'Tis true, in the Isle of <hi>Iava</hi> there
was never any of them found; but again 'tis certain, that on the Coast of <hi>Malabar, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romandel,
Bisnagar,</hi> and near to <hi>Malacca,</hi> this sort of Cane produces a Drug called <hi>Sacar
Mambus,</hi> that is, Sugar of <hi>Mambu.</hi> The <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Persians,</hi> and the <hi>Moores</hi> call it <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baxir,</hi>
which in their Language signifies a white frozen liquor. These Canes are as big as
the body of a Poplar, having straight branches, and leaves something longer then the
Olive-tree. They are divided into divers knots, wherein there is a certain white matter
like Starch, for which the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> give the weight in Silver, for the use they
make of it in Physick, against burning Feavers, and bloudy Fluxes, but especially upon the
first approaches of any Disease.</p>
                  <p>These Canes are so big,<note place="margin">Boats of Canes.</note> that the <hi>Indians</hi> cleave them to make Boats, leaving a knot at
each end, whereon they sit to guide it; one before, another behind, and use this sort of
Boat the rather, for that they are perswaded, Crocodiles bear a respect to the <hi>Mambu,</hi> and
never hurt the Boats made of this Cane.</p>
                  <p>In the Isle of <hi>Iava</hi> there is another fruit,<note place="margin">Duriaons.</note> called, amongst the <hi>Malayans, Duriaon,</hi> not to
be seen any where but in this place and the <hi>Malaccaes.</hi> The Tree that bears them, by the
<hi>Malayans</hi> call'd <hi>Batan,</hi> is as big as our Apple-tree, the bark thick, plentiful of boughs, and
wealthy in fruit: the blossom, which they call <hi>Buaa,</hi> is white, inclining to yellow, and the
leaves half a foot in length, and two or three fingers broad, on the outside, of a pale green,
drawing towards a grey; but on the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ibs, as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;
within 'tis divided into four quarters, which are again divided into two or three little
cells, that contain the fruit, which is as big and white as a Pullets-egg, and of taste so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
that the <hi>Bianco Maugiares,</hi> which the <hi>Portuguez</hi> compound of Rice, Brawns of
Capon, Cream, Sugar, and Rose-water, is not more dainty; each fruit hath a Stone as big
and rough as that of the Peach: It will not keep; for when the white begins to turn, it
must be thrown away, and must be eaten as soon as the husk begins to open. Such as are
not used to this fruit will not like it at first, for that it hath the smell of a roasted Onyon;
but the taste is so pleasing, that it may be reckoned amongst the prime and most excellent
fruits of the <hi>Indies:</hi> One thing it is very remarkable for, that there is so great an antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
between it and the <hi>Bettele,</hi> that the least number of <hi>Bettele</hi> leaves laid near a Room full
of <hi>Duriaons,</hi> they corrupt and rot immediately. Accordingly, when a man hath eaten
too much of this fruit, let him but lay two or three <hi>Bettele</hi> leaves upon his breast, and
he shall be eased; and the eating of but one of these leaves after the <hi>Duriaons</hi> causes
speedy digestion; so as thus one may eat as much as he will, without the least inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lantor</hi>-tree,<note place="margin">Lantor.</note> which is another sort of <hi>Cocoe</hi>-tree, as we said before, is frequent in
the Isle of <hi>Iava.</hi> The leaves are five or six foot long, and so smooth, that the <hi>Iavians</hi>
write upon it with a Bodkin, and use it instead of Paper.</p>

Of all the <hi>Indies,</hi> no part bears <hi>Cubebs</hi> but the Isle of <hi>Iava:</hi> the <hi>Iavians</hi> call it <hi>Cuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ombi,</hi>
and <hi>Cumuc;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cubebs.</note> the other <hi>Indians</hi> call it <hi>Cuba China,</hi> because the <hi>Chineses</hi> first fetch'd it
thence to furnish other parts, before the <hi>Portuguez</hi> or <hi>Hollanders</hi> had any Commerce there.
This Fruit grows up another Tree, like Pepper, and in bunches like Grapes. The <hi>Iavians</hi>
knowing 'tis not any where but with them, esteem it so, as they will not suffer a Plant to
go from amongst them, and sell it not unboyl'd, for fear it should be planted elsewhere,

six, or, at the most, seven thousand <hi>Caxaes.</hi> The use of it is to fortifie the Stomach, and
cleanse the Breast; but the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> take it with a little <hi>Areca,</hi> and are of opinion it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores
languishing and spent Nature.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mangosthan</hi> is a Fruit growing by the High-wayes in <hi>Iava,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mangost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han.</note> upon bushes, like our

                     <note place="margin">Talasse.</note> and which the <hi>Malayans</hi> call <hi>Lalade,</hi> bears neither
Fruit nor Flower; but 'tis used in Sauces, and some eat it green, and assign it the same vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
as they do the <hi>Cubebs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Iava</hi> they have another Fruit,<note place="margin">Jaca.</note> which grows likewise in other places, call'd <hi>Iaca,</hi> in
form and bigness like a Citrul, with a thick and rough rind: Within 'tis full of certrin
Nuts, the Kernels whereof, being toasted on coals, are good to eat, and stay the Flux of the
belly. The Tree is very great; but the boughs being not strong enough to bear the Fruit,
it hangs all along the body of it, up from the very ground: Being full ripe, the rind grows
hard and black, and emits a very sweet scent; the Fruit it self often changes taste, yielding
one while that of the Melon, another that of the Peach, sometimes that of Honey, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that of a sweet Lemmon; but is so hard of digestion, that 'tis never eaten, but vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up again: The Nut of it is as big as a Date, and causes windiness in those that eat them
green; but roasted after the manner we told you, they are very pleasant, and good for such
as have a kindness for Women.</p>
                  <p>In the same Island,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Wild</hi> Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon.</note> towards the Streight of <hi>Sunda,</hi> there grows also abundance of wild
Cinnamon, which the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Cantla de Mato,</hi> and the <hi>Malayans, Cajumanis.</hi> It is
not near so good as the fine Cinnamon, whence it comes that there is but little of it bought,
it being hardly worth the transportation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Carcapuli</hi> is a Fruit about the bigness of a Cherry,<note place="margin">Carcapuli.</note> and much of the same taste,
and the Trees which bear it are like our Cherry-trees. Of these there are several
kinds, whereof some are white, some of a dark red, and some of a lively carnation
colour.</p>

scent: The <hi>Turks, Persians,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> make an extraordinary Traffick of it, as they
likewise do of <hi>Calamus Aromaticus,</hi> which also grows on the Coast of the Streight of <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi>
That yellow and spungy matter, which Women use against pains in the Matrix, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
in the Stalk of it. The <hi>Iavians</hi> give it to their Horses, compounding it with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
Cummin-seed, Salt, Sugar, and Butter; making it into a Paste, which they call <hi>Arata;</hi>
and they hold it very soveraign for these beasts, to whom notwithstanding they never give
it, till the extremity of the heats be over.</p>

these parts, and is like to Ginger, only the Leaves something more long and broad.
They use to dry it, or preserve in Sugar, as they do Ginger, but esteem it above
Ginger.</p>
                  <p>There are two kinds of <hi>Galanga,</hi>

from <hi>China,</hi> and is much better then that which is brought out of the Isle of <hi>Iava,</hi> where
they call it <hi>Lanquus.</hi> This Herb is neither sowed nor set, but grows naturally, and is
about two foot high above the ground, the flower is white, and the leaves pointed, and as
hard as the point of a Knife. The <hi>Iavians</hi> use it for a Sallad, as also in Physick; as they
do the root, which is thick and long, and full of knots like a Cane, as biting in taste as Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and of a very sweet scent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Benjamin</hi> is a Gum distilling from Trees not unlike Lemmon-trees.<note place="margin">Benjamin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> While they are young
the <hi>Benjamin</hi> is black, which is the best; but as they grow old the <hi>Benjamin</hi> grows white,
and loses strength, so as to put it off, they mingle it with black: The <hi>Moors</hi> call it <hi>Lovan
Iavy,</hi> that is, Incense of <hi>Iava.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Forrest of <hi>Iava</hi> there grow Trees of red <hi>Sandale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </note> but the white and yellow
<hi>Sandale,</hi> which is without comparison the better, comes from the Isles of <hi>Timor</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</hi>
This Tree is of the bigness of a Walnut-tree, and bears a fruit not unlike our
Cherries, but is black and insipid. The <hi>Indians</hi> beat white and yellow <hi>Sandale,</hi> and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47786:258"/>
make a Concoction wherewith they rub their Bodies, not only for the scent, but for that
they believe 'tis restroative. They value not red <hi>Sandale,</hi> but sell it at cheap rates to other
parts.</p>
                  <p>They have likewise abundance of Ginger,<note place="margin">Ginger.</note> by the <hi>Malayans</hi> called <hi>Aliaa,</hi> and by the

                  <p>That Wood,<note place="margin">Palo de cuebro.</note> the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Pala de cuebra,</hi> grows there in great abundance. It is
white, inclining to yellow, hard and bitter. The <hi>Indians</hi> bruise it, and take it in Wine or
Water against burning Feavers, and the stinging of Serpents. 'Tis said, that for this cure
they are beholding to a Creature in size and shape like our Ferrets, by them called <hi>Quil</hi>
or <hi>Quirpela,</hi> which they breed for recreation, and to catch Rats and Mice: this little Beast
being a mortal enemy to Serpents, never meets with any of them, but it sets upon them,
and being bitten runs immediately to this root, which is his present cure.</p>

and by the <hi>Indians, Calamba,</hi> grows in <hi>Iava,</hi> but not in such quantity as in <hi>Malacca, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra,
Cambaya,</hi> and other places. The Tree is like the Olive-tree, only a little bigger.
The Wood, while green, hath no scent, but as it dries its odour increases. The weightiest
and brownest is the best; the perfection is known by the Oyl that issues out of it when
'tis held to the fire. They make Beads of it, and the <hi>Indians</hi> use it to imbellish their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets,
but the chiefest use of it is for Physick. For this Wood beaten to powder, and taken
in broath or wine, fortifies the Stomack, stayes vomiting, and cures the Pleurisie and bloudy
Flux. That the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Aguila brava,</hi> or wild <hi>Calamba,</hi> is not so good as the other,
and the <hi>Indians</hi> chiefly use it at the Funerals of their <hi>Bramans,</hi> making the fire of it that

                  <p>At <hi>Bantam</hi> likewise they sell store of <hi>Lacque,</hi>

and the Varnish they lay over so many excellent works in <hi>China, Iapan,</hi> and other places.
<hi>Iava</hi> produces of it; but the best comes from <hi>Pegu,</hi> where 'tis called <hi>Tieck,</hi> and where
great and winged Ants get up the trees and suck the Gum, which afterwards they lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the boughs as Bees do Honey and Wax: when the boughs are full, the owners cut
them, setting them to dry in the Sun, till the <hi>Lacque</hi> falls from the boughs, then they beat
it to powder, and give it what colour and form they please.</p>

<hi>Pontiou</hi> they hold good against Feavers, but 'tis exceeding dear. <hi>Gatogamber</hi> is a Fruit like

is a sovereign Remedy against Poyson, and the biting of Venomous beasts. <hi>Ialave</hi> is like

in a Sea-fight they had near <hi>Bantam</hi> and <hi>Iacatra, Ianuary</hi> 2. 1619. The <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet,
which consisted but of seven Vessels, had the worst of the <hi>English,</hi> that were eleven. The
<hi>Dutch</hi> being forced to retreat, the King of <hi>Iacatra,</hi> with the <hi>English</hi> Forces, besieg'd the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Fort, now called <hi>Batavia;</hi> which Siege lasted six moneths, till the <hi>Holland</hi> General,
having reinforced his Fleet with the Ships that lay in the <hi>Mol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to raise the Siege, to embark their Guns, and quit the Streight of <hi>Sunda,</hi> to get into the
main Sea. The King of <hi>Iacatra</hi> would have cast the blame of all these disturbances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>English;</hi> but the <hi>Dutch</hi> General would not be satisfied with such excuses, but
landing his Forces, to the number of eleven hundren men, he assaulted the Town of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catra,</hi>
which he took by force, and, having put all to the sword, fir'd it. That done, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> compleated the fortification of their Quarters, and brought it to a regular form,
with four Bastions of Free-stone, well trench'd and pallisado'd, with Half-moons, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts,
and other necessary Works. The King of <hi>Matram,</hi> who is as 'twere Emperour
of <hi>Iava,</hi> in the year 1628. besieg'd this Fort, and, lying under the Cannon, storm'd it
several times; but in the end was forc'd to raise the Siege, as hein like manner was the
year following; and since that time the <hi>Dutch</hi> have established their Commerce joyntly
with the <hi>Chineses,</hi> the <hi>Iaponeses, Siameses, Succadans,</hi> and other Neighbours, taking
ten in the hundred Custom upon all Commodities, whether brought thither, or carried
thence.</p>

sheltred with some small Islands on the Sea side, is one of the best Roads in all the <hi>Indies.</hi>
Strangers that inhabit there pay a certain tax by the moneth, according to the profit they
make, which is great: for a Porter, who will with ease get two Ryals a day, payes but one

make water, because Dogs, held with them unclean beasts, piss standing. There is not a

from the same word comes the <hi>Bazarucques,</hi> the least Money that is sent to the Market.
The Stone is smooth and greenish, and the more substantial and weighty it is, the better it
is, and of the greater vertue. In the Country of <hi>Pan,</hi> near <hi>Malacca,</hi> they find a Stone in
the Gall of a certain Swine, more highly esteem'd then the <hi>Bazar.</hi> It is of a reddish co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,

the Air was so unhealthful they could not subsist. Their Houses are of Timber,
but so sleightly built, that they ordinarily pull them down to change their habitations, or
pass over to the other side of the River. They are an ingenious and dexterous people, but
addicted to theft, and great affecters of Pyracy, so as sometimes they will cruze up and
down the Sea as far as the Coasts of <hi>Pegu,</hi> which is four hundred Leagues from that Island.
They use all sorts of Arms, as Swords, and <hi>Gosos,</hi> which are Bucklers made of boyled
Leather, Lances, Darts, and a sort of Pikes they call <hi>Selihes,</hi> the wood whereof is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hard, but withall so small and brittle, that if it break in a Wound, it leaves Splinters, that
render the part incurable. The King is a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> as also the greatest part of the

Provisions, particularly Rice, wherewith in the moneths of <hi>March, April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> the
Territory is so entirely covered, that 'tis not to be imagined there is an inch untill'd: and

not a people so tractable as they: yet they are couragious and irreconcileable where they
once declare enmity. Their chief Armes is Bow and Arrow, whereof they impoyson the

Prepuce a Ball or two of Ivory, or a Fish-bone, massie, and not hollow, like the <hi>Siameses</hi> and
<hi>Peguans:</hi> but this custom by degrees wears out, as that amongst the Women, to cut their
Hair off; for at present they let it grow, and coif themselves as the <hi>Malayans</hi> do. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
when they walk the Streets, and Slaves, have their Breasts open, and wear Breeches
that reach from the Navil to the Knee; but when they bathe in their Cisterns or Wells in
the Street, they are stark naked. The Houses of <hi>Macassar</hi> are built upon Piles, and rais'd
nine or ten foot above the ground, by reason of the Rains which fall with the West and
North-west Winds from <hi>November</hi> till <hi>March,</hi> during which season the Road is exceeding

West-side of the Capital Town there is a Bay of six Leagues, composing a good Road,
where Ships are well sheltered from all Winds. By reason of this Bay the Sea wants not
much of cutting thorow the Island; for on the other side the Sea advances so far within
the Land, that it leaves but a small Isthmus of about sixscore fathom over. The Island
being thus, as 'twere, divided into two parts, the lesser, wherein is the Castle of <hi>Amboyna,</hi>

brutish, and, like their Neighbours, <hi>Anthropophagi,</hi> or Canibals, in so much that they
would devour their Parents, when age made them decrepit, or when they were visited with
any desperate Disease. The Land it self lay wild, and overgrown with Forrests; but at

Oranges, <hi>Cocoes, Bonanas,</hi> Sugar-canes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oranges particularly are so plentiful, that
one may buy fourscore for a Button. The Inhabitants are a sort of simple people, habited

use no other Arms then the Dart, (which they cast so dexterously, that they will not
miss the breadth of a Crown piece threescore paces distant) the Cimeter, and Buckler.
They make a sort of Cakes of Rice, Almonds and Sugar, which they sell to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of the adjacent Islands, where they take them against Fluxes. They make likewise
Rice-bread, in the form of Sugar-loaves. Their Galleys, which they call <hi>Caracoras,</hi> are
well built; and they know how to manage them with such address, that ours come not
near them for swiftness.</p>

He was come in the Name of the States of the United Provinces, and the Prince of

presumption only, they are undone; and commonly the whole Family suffers with them.
The horrour they have of these people, is one cause they watch dead bodies, with Sword

                  <p>The <hi>Amboynians</hi> are naturally timerous,<note place="margin">Their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</note> gross and stupid, unfaithful, and so diffident, that

comely personage.</p>
                  <p>From the account we have given you of their Marriages, the small affection betwixt
Man and Wife may easily be guessed at; as indeed there is little or none at all, yet they

care to correct them; and to this reason we may attribute the disorders that often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
the Children out-raging Nature in the persons of those that brought them into the
world.</p>
                  <p>The little knowledge they have of Religion causes a most remarkable humour of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation

The <hi>Portuguez</hi> transported thither heretofore some families of free persons, call'd <hi>Maldecas,</hi>
whom they had taken near <hi>Malacca,</hi> and who serving the <hi>Portuguez</hi> had gotten their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and in some measure their Religion; but these Families are lost by degrees, and the

are <hi>Chineses,</hi> there is not a <hi>Christian</hi> in the Island.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have three Forts in the Isle of <hi>Amboyna,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Banda</hi> lies twenty four Leagues from <hi>Amboyna,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Banda.</note> and is about three Leagues in length, and
one in breadth, reaching from North to South in form of a Horse-shooe. It contains some
small Towns, whereof the chief is <hi>Nera,</hi> but <hi>Orsattan</hi> and <hi>Labbettacca</hi> are inconsiderable.
The Inhabitants are all <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and so zealous in their Religion, and so devout, they
will not meddle in any business till they have said their Prayers. They enter not into their
<hi>Mesquites</hi> till they have wash'd their feet; and being there, they pray with such vehemency,
that they may be heard two hundred paces thence. Those Prayers ended, they rub their
faces with both hands, lay a Matt on the ground and stand upon it, lift their eyes twice or
thrice to Heaven, fall on their knees, and bow their head two or three times to the ground,
pronouncing certain Prayers with a low voyce, only moving the lips. In their <hi>Mesquites</hi>
they have many meetings, where they eat together of what is brought thither by every
one. They have likewise some such Assemblies upon a Mountain, which is in a Wood in
the middle of the Island, where the Inhabitants of <hi>Puldrim, Puloway,</hi> and <hi>Lantor,</hi> their
Allies, meet them to consider of publick matters. After they have treated of publick
Affairs, they sit down on the ground, and they serve to every one upon a <hi>Banana</hi> leaf, which
serves them instead of a Trencher, a Morsel of <hi>Sagu,</hi> which is their Bread, and a little Rice
steep'd in broath, which they eat by handfuls. During the Feast, the Gentlemen, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Guests, have a kind of Skirmish. They are almost in continual war with their
Neighbours, and keep constant Guards upon the Coast, as well to surprize others, as to
prevent their being surprized themselves. Their Arms are the <hi>Cimetar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arms.</note> with them called
a <hi>Phahang,</hi> and a Buckler of wood above four foot long. They handle their Weapons with
much address, being train'd to it from their infancy. They have likewise Fire-arms, but in
war they chiefly use a sort of Lance, of eight or ten foot long, made of an exceeding hard
wood, which they cast with such force, that they will run a Man quite through with it.
Having cast their Lances, for commonly they carry two, they fall to their Sword, which
hangs at their left side under their Buckler, or to another sort of Weapon, which they dart
and pull back with a string, whereto they tye a short Truncheon, having at the end a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
iron that is exceeding sharp and dangerous. Some use Corslets, but these are Persons of
Quality; others contenting themselves with Casks of Steel, and made like Cocks-combs.
Their Gallies are very light, having on both sides, in a manner even with the water, two
Scaffolds like wings, where the Slaves are set to row. They are three to every seat, and
every one hath an Oar, which is properly but a deep wooden Shovel, which they thrust as
far as they can into the Sea, and when they draw it back, they bring it about their heads to
cast out the water; which they do so fast, and with such sleight, that a Ship must be a good
Sailor, that shall with a good wind take one of these Gallies.</p>
                  <p>In the Isle of <hi>Banda</hi> 'tis no rarity to meet with people of sixscore years of age,<note place="margin">They live long.</note> and above.
They believe, that who fails to pray for the dead shall have no resurrection, whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
with the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> they believe the resurrection of the dead. Women that are
present at the death of a friend, cry out with all violence, as if by this means they would
fetch the Soul back again, but seeing it comes not, they interr the Corps, which is born by
ten or twelve persons on their Shoulders, in a Biere or Coffin covered with white Linnen,
the Men going before, the Women behind. The Corps being laid in the ground, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the house of the deceased, where they dine together; then they burn Incense over
the Grave for four and twenty hours, and at night set a burning Lamp over it, in a Hut
made for that purpose.</p>

                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:47786:261"/>
The Men mind nothing but their recreation, and walking up and down, and leave all
the work to be done by their Wives, whose chiefest business is to break the Nutmeg shell,
and dry the Nut and Mace, wherein consists their greatest revenue. This excellent fruit,
for ought I could ever learn, grows only in the Isle of <hi>Banda,</hi> which the Inhabitants call
<hi>Bandan,</hi> or rather in the six Isles 'tis composed of, that is <hi>Gunaxi, Nera,</hi> and <hi>Lantor,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
which lies the Road for the Vessels that are bound thither) <hi>Puloway, Pulorim,</hi> and
<hi>Bassingin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a thing to be admired, that these six little Islands should furnish the whole World
with Nutmegs, if it were not certain, that except a few <hi>Duriaons, Nancan, Bananas,</hi> Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and <hi>Cocoes</hi> that grow there, they produce not any thing else; and the Islands are so
covered with Nutmeg-trees, that excluding only the fiery Mountain in the Isle of <hi>Gunapi,</hi>
there is not a foot of Land but is employed, and the Trees at all times loaden with fruit
and flowers green or ripe. They chiefly gather them thrice a year; that is, in <hi>April,
August</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> but that which ripens in <hi>April</hi> is the best. The Tree is not unlike a
Peach-tree,<note place="margin">Nutmegs.</note> only the leaves are more short and round. The Fruit is covered with a husk,
as thick as that of our Wallnuts, which being opened, there appears a very thin leaf upon
a hard shell; yet does it not so cover it, but that the shell is to be seen in several places,
and this is that they call the Nutmeg flower or Mace, and the shell must be broken to
come at the fruit. The flower is of a lively carnation, while the Nut is green; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it changes, and draws towards an Orange colour, especially when it parts from the
shell. The Inhabitants preserve it in the shell, with Salt or Sugar, and make a very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Preserve. The Natives call the Nutmeg <hi>Palla,</hi> and Mace <hi>Bunapalla.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Maces.</note> This Spice
comforts the Brain, helps the Memory, expels Wind, cleanses the Reins, and stayes Loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Mace hath almost the same vertues, but 'tis much more proper for Sauces. Oyl
of Nutmegs strengthens the Sinews,<note place="margin">The Oyl of Nutmeg.</note> procures Sleep, stayes Defluxions, and cures
the pains in the Stomack; and of powder of Nutmeg or Mace mixt with the Oyl

                  <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have built here two Forts,<note place="margin">The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> Forts in <hi>Banda.</hi>
                     </note> which they call <hi>Nassau</hi> and <hi>Belgica,</hi> where
the Road is so good, that Vessels come up within Musket-shot, and ride safely at nine or ten
fathom water. The Island is inhabited with about ten or eleven thousand persons; yet
would it be hard to draw out five hundred Men fit to bear Arms. Here they drive a good
round trade in Garments brought from <hi>Coromandel,</hi> Rice, Purcelane, Velvet, Damask,
Taffaty, Scarlet, Provisions and Ammunirion for the Forts. The Inhabitants are obstinate
and mutinous, so as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> cannot assure the possession of this Isle, but by force
alone.</p>

The Tree is a mans fathom about, nevertheless with a Knife it may be cut down, because
'tis only Bark and Pith: The Bark is about an inch thick, and the rest all Pith, which
serves for Bread. It is somewhat like worm-eaten wood, save that it is white, and may
be eaten as it comes from the Tree, taking away the strings of the wood which are mixed
with it;<note place="margin">How they make bread of it.</note> but to make Bread they order it as follows. Having felled the Tree, they cut
it Cylinder-wise, and beat the Pith to powder, which looks like Meal; then they put it in
a Searce they make of the Bark of the same Tree, over a Tub made of the Leaves, and
according as the Searce fills they pour in Water, which dividing the Meal from the Strings
of wood that are mixt therewith, falls into the Tub, as white and thick as Milk, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a certain settling or consistency at the bottom, falls out at a little Spout at the top of
the Tub; this settled consistency is that which they call <hi>Sagu,</hi> and serves them instead of
Meal, and in effect is such, when it is dry. It is baked in certain Moulds of Earth, which
they make red hot in the fire, so as putting in this substance, it becomes Paste, and bakes
in a moment, so speedily, that one Man, in a morning, may bake Bread to suffice a hundred

their Eyes great, their Eyebrows large, their Bodies strong and robustous, but fitter for war

In conversation with Strangers they are civil and obliging; but a little too familiar and
importunate in their demands, self-ended in Commerce, diffident, deceitful, and lyars,
needy, and by consequence insolent. Men wear Turbants, after the Turkish fashion, of
several colours, deckt with Plumes: The King only wears a Crown like a Miter, but in all
things else is clad like his other Subjects, in a <hi>Iupo,</hi> and Drawers of <hi>China</hi> Sattin, blew,
red, crimson, green, and yellow. Some there are wear close Coats, tied on the Shoulders,
and cut below, like the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> military Coats. Women dress themselves in their
Hair, which they lay smooth over their Heads, and tye it behind, and deck it with Plumes
and Flowers, which well becomes them. They have Bracelets, Rings, Neck-laces of
Pearl, Diamonds, Rubies, and Emralds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> apparelling themselves almost all in Silk,
using the Stuffes they have from <hi>Persia, China,</hi> and the rest of the East, in truck for their
Cloves.</p>

admit the adoration of their Gods, from whom divers of their Families pretend
to be descended. They know no written Law, and their Customs are barbarous enough;
<hi>Polygamy</hi> is allowed amongst them, and Adultery passes unpunished; but Theft is severely
punished, as a mortal and unpardonable Crime among them. They have Officers, who at

the Masters of Families to remember their Matrimonial Duties, by reason it concerns
the publick, that the Inhabitants should multiply. Both Men and Women express their
arrogancy in their carriage and gate. Every Island hath a peculiar Language, whence we

this Commerce, together with that of other Spices, in the Ports of the Red Sea; where
the <hi>Romans</hi> having reduc'd that Kingdom to a Province, continued it till the dissolution

King of <hi>Tidor,</hi> made it their earnest request to have the advantage of the Fort the
<hi>Portuguez</hi> were about to build, to secure the possession of these Isles. 'Tis true, these two
Princes were declared enemies, and thought to make use of these Strangers Forces in their
particular quarrels: but 'tis to be believed their jealousie was grounded on other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
for that <hi>Cachil Laudan,</hi> King of <hi>Bachiam,</hi> made the like request to <hi>Tristan de Meneses,</hi>

But the possession of these Isles was of such importance to the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> for continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Spice trade, that they did what was possible to keep them, wherein they found
the less trouble, because the Emperour had his hands full in <hi>Europe,</hi> and was but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly

the year following to <hi>Sevil,</hi> where likewise they came to no result: so as the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
continued in this state, till the Treaty at <hi>Saragossa,</hi> in the year 1529. at which the
Emperour engag'd these Islands to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> for three hundred and fifty
thousand Ducates. Ever since the <hi>Portuguez</hi> have injoyed them, till by the union of the

hath so changed the face of Affairs, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> must first conquer that Kingdom,
before they think of the Appendages belonging thereto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ternate</hi> is the first and largest Isle of the <hi>Molucques,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ternate.</note> scituate twenty eight Leagues from
the Isle of <hi>Banda,</hi> and forty degrees on this side the Line. It is about eight Leagues in
compass, and no bad Country, yet yields but little Provisions besides Poultry and Goats. It
produces likewise Almonds, excellent good, and bigger then ordinary, though there be
three or four in every shell, which is so hard, 'tis not easily to be broken with a Hammer,
but they make so strong a fire, that Smiths and Forgemen use it instead of Coal. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
likewise plant Tobacco, but 'tis far short of that comes from the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Gamma lamma.</note> stands on the Sea-side, and is but one Street,
about 2500. paces long. Their Houses are built of Canes or Timber, as are also the
<hi>Masquites</hi> and Palace Royal. The Road is of no use, for that the bottom being nothing

                  <p>The most precious thing in these Islands is the Clove;<note place="margin">Cloves.</note> I know not if it be the same
<hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Garyophylla,</hi> though the <hi>Persians</hi> call it <hi>Calafur,</hi> and these two words seem to
have the same Etymology. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> sometimes called it <hi>Girofe,</hi> but at present they
call it <hi>Clavos,</hi> by reason of its likeness to an ordinary Nail. The <hi>Molucques</hi> call the Tree
that bears them <hi>Siger,</hi> the Leaf <hi>Varaqua,</hi> and the Fruit <hi>Chamque.</hi> The Tree is much like
the Laurel, only the Leaves something less and narrower, like the Almond-tree, and shoots
forth its branches at the top as Myrtle doe. When 'tis in flower it persumes the Air round
about it; and the Fruit is at first white, in time grows green, and so brown, but not black
till it be gathered.</p>
                  <p>Some beat them down with Poles, but commonly they fasten a Rope to the branch a
little above the boal, and drawing it to them force away the Fruit and leaves with much
violence, and so it is when the Inhabitants sell it, and so the <hi>Chineses</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it.</p>
                  <p>The Trees grow of themselves,<note place="margin">The tree grows without planting.</note> as the Chesnut-trees do, without planting, or any cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation.
In the eighth year they bear, and last a hundred years, bringing forth every two
years: for besides the injury done the branches, in getting off the fruit, as we said before,
the Inhabitants break off the young buds, which shoot forth the first year, that they may
be sure of a better crop the next. It is at its full ripeness from <hi>August</hi> till <hi>Ianuary;</hi> and
when it is gathered, it is laid in the Sun, and in two or three dayes it is sufficiently
dried.</p>

                     <hi>Avicenna</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">Avicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's <hi>errour.</hi>
                     </note> that the Gum of this Tree is like Turpentine; but he is mistaken, it
being certain, that it does not produce any at all. For it is so hot, that it does not only
drink up all the Water Heaven is pleased to send it, but it also attracts all the moisture of
the Earth lying about it; nay, its Fruit is so hot, that if a Pitcher of Water be set in a
Chamber, within ten foot of a bag of Cloves, they will so suck up the Water, that within
two or three dayes there shall not be a drop left: which that they have done shall not be
perceivable any way, but by the weight. The Inhabitants know this well enough, and
make their advantages thereof. The <hi>Chineses</hi> have the same experiment in their raw Silks,
which do attract moysture in the same manner.</p>
                  <p>It is commonly affirmed,<note place="margin">What cloves the <hi>Moluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caes</hi> yields yearly.</note> that the Cloves grow only in the <hi>Moluccaes:</hi> but this is said,
either in regard some comprehend under that name many other Islands near them, or that
the five we have named yield more then all the rest. It is generally granted, that they
yield every year near six thousand barrels of Cloves, allowing five hundred weight and a
half to every barrel, and it is certain withall, that the Islands of <hi>Ires, Meytarana, Cavaly,
Sabugo, Marigoran, Gamoconora,</hi> and <hi>Amboyna,</hi> yield also very considerable quantities,
especially that of <hi>Veranula;</hi> though they are not so fair as those of the neighbouring
Islands.</p>

                     </note> there is one of the highest Mountains in those
parts, covered all over with Palms and other Trees, having at the top a hole so deep, that
it seems to reach the Center of the Earth. Some have had the curiosity to make trial of
the depth of it, and have found that a Rope of five hundred fathom touched not the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
but reach'd a fair Spring, the water whereof was very clear; yet hath there not yet
been any that durst venture to taste of it. Out of this Mountain there issues a sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
smell, and by certain intervals a thick smoak, and sometimes, especially at the two
Equinoxes, it casts up flames, and red Stones, with such violence, that some are carried not
only as far as the City, but even into the Islands of <hi>Meao,</hi> and <hi>Cafures,</hi> twenty Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from <hi>Ternate.</hi> The smoak infects all the circum-ambient Air, and the excrements
which the Mountain casts forth, do so corrupt the Springs and waters of those parts, that
no use can be made thereof. The Mountain is green two third parts of its height, but
from thence upward it is insupportably cold, and there is on the top of it a Spring of fair
water, but so cold, that a man can drink but very little of it without taking breath. From
the top of it may be seen the Sea, and all the <hi>Moluccas;</hi> upon it, a man hath a clear and
serene Air, which is never troubled with Mists or Clouds; and there is a Lake of sweet
water, set about with Trees, in which there is a great number of blew and yellow Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
bigger then a mans arm, which sink under the water as soon as any body comes near
them.</p>
                  <p>There is no difference of Seasons in these Islands,<note place="margin">But one season in the <hi>Moluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caes.</hi>
                     </note> nor any certain time for Rain, though
it rains oftner with the North-west wind, then it does with the South. There are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
there thirty foot long, and of a proportionable bigness; but they are neither dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47786:263"/>
nor venemous, no more then are those of <hi>Banda.</hi> Some affirm, that these Creatures,
not finding any thing to feed upon, eat Grass, and going to the Sea-side vomit up what they
had eaten, and by that means draw together a great many Fish, which being intoxicated
with the chew'd Grass, flote upon the Water, and so become the prey and food of these
Serpents.</p>
                  <p>There is in this Island a kind of Beasts they call <hi>Cusos,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cusos.</note> that keeps constantly in Trees,
living on nothing but Fruit. They resemble our Rabbets, and have a thick, curling, and
smooth hair, between gray and red, eyes round and fiery, little feet, and such strength in the
tail, that they will hang by it, the better to reach the fruits. The Forrests are full of wild
Birds, and, except the Parrot, there are few domestick, at least of those known to us.
There are Crevisses that come ashore, and creep under certain Trees, the very shadow
whereof is so virulent, that no Grass grows near them. I know not whether it be from
that Tree they contract that venomous quality, which lies in one part of them, which is
so dangerous, that it kills in four and twenty hours those that eat it. Others there are
that resemble Grashoppers, and lye in Rocks, where they take them by night with fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:
near the tail, in a bag, they have a lump that is exceeding delicate, for which they
take them.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Moluccaes</hi> there is a certain Wood,<note place="margin">A Wood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combustible.</note> which, laid in the fire, burns, sparkles, and

                  <p>Near the Fort of <hi>Ternate</hi> grows a Plant,<note place="margin">Leaves turn'd to Butterflyes.</note> by the Inhabitants call'd <hi>Catopa,</hi> from which
there falls a small Leaf, the Stalk whereof turns to the Head of a Worm, or Butterfly, the
Strings to the body and feet, and the wings are made out of the finer part of the Leaf, so
as at last there is a compleat Butterfly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tidor</hi> is an Island as fruitful as that of <hi>Ternate,</hi> but larger. In a Signet of the Kings of
this Island, in <hi>Persian</hi> or <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters, it appears, this Island was called <hi>Tudura,</hi> not
<hi>Tidor;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tidor.</note> and they say the word signifies Beauty and Fertility. These people have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
to prune and water the Clove-tree, which by this means bears a fruit much fairer
and stronger then that which owes its production only to nature. The white Sandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
that grows here, is doubtless the best of all the <hi>Indies.</hi> Here they have Birds,<note place="margin">Birds of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.</note> by

catch them cut off their feet so near the body, that the flesh beginning to dry, the skin and

where there grows great store of <hi>Sagou,</hi> so as the Inhabitants subsist with little labour,
which makes them so idle and lazy, that the Kingdom, which heretofore was one of the
most considerable of the <hi>Molucques,</hi> is so sunk from that grandeur, that at present it can
hardly raise five hundred fighting men.</p>
                  <p>The Isle of <hi>Machiam</hi> was brought under the jurisdiction of the <hi>Dutch</hi> by Admiral
<hi>Paul van Carden,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Machiam.</note> in the year 1601. The chiefest of the three Forts they are possessed of is
that of <hi>Guoffiquia,</hi> which is built upon an Eminency, with four Bastions of stone, yet is it
but a small one, and irregular, in regard that, for want of place, they could not make all the
Bastions of the same bigness, nor extend the Curtain as far as it should have been. The
Fort of <hi>Taffaso</hi> is also upon an ascent, and hath four Bastions; but it is bigger then the
other, and distant from the Sea about a hundred and sixty paces. These two Forts have
neither Wells nor Cisterns, save that near the top of the ascent on which <hi>Taffaso</hi> stands,
there is a Well within a Half-moon, which serves for a fifth Bastion to the place. <hi>Tabillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
hath but two Bastions, so far one from the other, that they cannot command all the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
so that there is no great account to be made thereof. This Island is about seven
Leagues in compass, and subject to the King of <hi>Ternate:</hi> It is very populous, able to
raise two thousand and two hundred fighting Men; and it hath <hi>Sagu</hi> and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
sufficient for the Inhabitants, and yields as much Cloves as any of the other
Islands.</p>
                  <p>Besides the five Islands properly called the <hi>Molucques,</hi> there are others, to the number

                  <p>This City lies in a Canton of Land, incompassed all about with the Sea, fourteen De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
on this side the Line, in the most Southerly part of the Isle, which is in compass
thee hundred and fifty Leagues. On the North, it hath <hi>China,</hi> from which it is distant
seventy Leagues; on the North-East, the Isle of <hi>Iapan,</hi> which is two hundred and seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Leagues distant from it; Eastward, the Ocean, and towards the South the great Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago,
which is as it were divided into five Seas, filled with so many Islands, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Provinces, that it may be said, they are in a manner innumerable. The <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses,</hi>
who were heretofore possessed thereof, have now deserted them, but still trade
thither.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants in their labour answer the fertility of the soyl, which produces Corn,
Rice, all sorts of Fruits, and Drugs; and it breeds Neat, Buffler, Deer, Goats and Swine;
so as they want nothing necessary to livelihood; and the <hi>Chineses</hi> take care they shall want
nothing that is superfluous, as Silk, Purcelane, and <hi>Lacque.</hi> They have also Date-wine,
but they make it of a different manner to other places: for they draw it from their <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes,</hi>
by cutting off one of the boughs, whence there distils a Liquor which they suffer to
work till it grows as strong as <hi>Spanish</hi> wine. They have the best Lemmons and Oranges
in the World, and the most excellent Figs and Pears, all sorts of Birds of prey, and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick,
Falcons, Tercels, Parrots, Eagles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but principally such abundance of Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles,
that they are constrain'd to kill them, to extirpate the breed: for you have here Men
of sufficient courage to encounter a Crocodile single, though as big as an Oxe. For the
Combat they Gantlet their left Arm to the Elbow,<note place="margin">Hunting of Crocodiles.</note> taking in that hand a Truncheon of a
foot long pik'd at both ends, and a Dagger in the other, and in this posture they go into the
River up to the Waste. The Crocodile no sooner spies his Man, but he comes on with
open mouth to swallow him; the <hi>Indian</hi> presents him his left hand, and thrusting it down
his throat, hinders his jaws from shutting, and in the mean time gives him so many wounds
in his throat with his Poniard, that he kills him. This Creature is in form like a Lizard, but
covered with Scales, so hard, that he is invulnerable all over but in the throat and belly. It
layes abundance of Eggs, which are so hard, that they will not break with throwing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Stone; and to hatch them they thrust them into the Sand, on a River side, that heat
and moisture, the principles of Generation, may hatch them. These Islands breed more
Tigers, Lions, Bears, and other wild Beasts, then <hi>Africk</hi> does, but especially the
<hi>Algalias,</hi> which are the Creatures from which they get the Musks, and Civet-Cats.</p>
                  <p>All these Islands are very populous, and so rich, that not only the <hi>Chineses</hi> continue their
trading thither, with great advantage, but also the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>

some Priests. These are so highly respected by the Inhabitants, who have not shaken off
their Original simplicity, that they govern the Country, and keep it in subjection to the
<hi>Spaniards.</hi> They are indeed such absolute Masters of these Islands, that though in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of them there is not so much as one <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet is there not one of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
refuses to pay the Tax imposed upon him, which is by the Poll, at ten Ryals a

the City it self is so great, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been forc'd to divide some part of it
from the rest, to serve them for a Cittadel, in case of necessity; by which means they avoid
the charge of keeping so great a number of Souldiers as might be requisite for the defence
of the place. The Haven, which is called <hi>Cavite,</hi> lies two leagues from the City, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by two wooden Forts. There live within the City of <hi>Manilla,</hi> and about it, above
fifteen thousand <hi>Chineses,</hi> besides those who come thither every year, from <hi>December</hi> to
<hi>April,</hi> and trade with above five hundred Ships. The <hi>Iaponeses</hi> come thither also, but

are of the <hi>Chineses.</hi>

                        <hi>JAPAN</hi> is a collection of several Islands made there by the Sea, from the one and
thirtieth degree of elevation to the thirty ninth, being in some places but ten leagues
in breadth, in others, reaching to thirty. This Country, which was anciently called
<hi>Chryses,</hi> or, if we may credit <hi>Mark Paulo Veneto, Zipangry,</hi> hath on the East <hi>New Spain,</hi>
on the North <hi>Tartary,</hi> on the West <hi>China,</hi> and on the South the Sea, and that part of the
World, which is called <hi>Terra Australis.</hi> It is divided into sixty six little Kingdoms, fifty
three whereof depend on that part of this great Empire, which is properly called
<hi>Iapon,</hi> or <hi>Iapan,</hi> and consists of two very powerful Kingdoms, called <hi>Meaco,</hi> and
<hi>Amagunce,</hi> under which all the rest are comprehended. The other part is called
<hi>Ximo,</hi> and comprehends nine Kingdomes or Provinces; the chiefest whereof are
<hi>Bungo</hi> and <hi>Figen;</hi> and the third part called <hi>Xicoum,</hi> comprehends the other four
Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iaponneses</hi> themselves acknowledge,<note place="margin">It is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether it be on Island or Continent.</note> that they cannot positively affirm, whether
their Country be an Island, or part of the Continent; inasmuch as from the Province of
<hi>Quanto,</hi> whereof the City and Castle of <hi>Iedo</hi> is the Metropolis, as it is also of the whole
Territory, as far as the extremities of the Province of <hi>Tzungaa,</hi> it is seven and twenty
dayes journey towards East and North-East. Then you cross an Arm of the Sea, about
eleven leagues over, to get into the Province of <hi>Iesso,</hi> or <hi>Sesso,</hi> which is so covered with
Woods, and checker'd up and down with Mountains, that the Emperour of <hi>Iapan</hi> hath
not yet been able to search what may be had out of them. All they could ever learn, is,
that there were seen in those parts a sort of people, who were hairy all over their bodies,
and suffered the hair of their heads and beards to grow, so as that they seem'd rather beasts
then men. Whereto they add, that they make use of that passage by Sea, to go into <hi>Sesso,</hi>
whence they bring Furs, not out of this respect, that the Sea divides that Province from
<hi>Iapan,</hi> but that it were a great way about to go over those inaccessible Mountains which
joyn those two Provinces.</p>
                     <p>The Island which we call <hi>Iapan,</hi> and the Inhabitants name <hi>Nippon,</hi> is divided into six
great Provinces, which are called <hi>Sayecock, Chickock, Iamaysoirt, Ietsengen, Quanto</hi> and
<hi>Ochio,</hi> which are subdivided into several other lesser ones, which are governed and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Lords and Princes, whose names we shall here give, together with their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
that the Reader may thereby judge of the greatness of this Empire, whereof
we have hitherto had no great knowledge, setting down the sums according to their
way of accounting, by <hi>Cockiens,</hi> which are worth about four Crowns <hi>French</hi> money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.</p>

                     <p>Now the Revenues of the Princes and Lords of whom we have given this account,
consists altogether in Lordships and Demesnes: for some are rich in Corn and Cattle, others
in several Mines, as Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Quick-silver, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others are wealthy
in Woods, Flax, Cotton, or Silk; of all which the Emperour hath a certain knowledge, by
the secret informations sent him by those Secretaries whom he places about them to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
their Affairs; for he recommends to every one of them a Secretary, with a Letter to
this effect.<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi>'s poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> 
                        <hi>Well-beloved, I know you have many Vassals and Servants, and that the occasions
wherein you are to employ them are very great; therefore I send you a person, whose assistance
may in some measure ease you of the burthen which lies upon you, and of whose fidelity you
may be assur'd, in as much as I commend him to you, as one who hath been brought up at my
own house: Make use of him, and take in good part the care I have of your person and affairs.</hi>
These indeed, for the most part, are such as have serv'd the Emperour in their youth, in his
three Chambers, and of whose abilities, prudence, and judgment he is satisfied, assuring
himself of their fidelity, besides the expressions he might find thereof during the time of
their service, by an act signed with their bloud: in so much that there is not ought done
in the Provinces, whereof he hath not, by this means, a perfect account. For these Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
keep an exact Journal of whatever they observe in the life and actions of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whom they are sent to, who undertake nothing without their advice, nor do any busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
wherein they are not consulted, which gives them great authority in the Provinces,
and makes the Princes themselves look on them as such, whose favour they stand in need of
to keep a fair correspondence with the Court. On the other side, these Princes are glad to
have able and understanding persons about them, such as may observe the miscarriages of
their Government, and have the confidence to be their Remembrancers thereof; as chusing
rather that a faithful Servant should acquaint them therewith, that so they may be seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
reform'd, then that they should become the discourse of the people, or any should
take occasion thence to do them ill Offices about the Emperour.</p>
                     <p>The great Lords,<note place="margin">The Lords have three names.</note> who govern the chiefest Provinces, have three names; to wit, their
own proper Name, that of the Family, and the Sirname, which they take from their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and which they commonly give the Castle where they live; and they are the more
willing to be called by the name of their Family,<note place="margin">Slaves dye with their Masters.</note> then their own, upon this account; that,
as they say, the Family was before them. But it is withall to be observed, that there is
not any man but hath his name changed thrice; for the name which had been given him
in his Infancy, being not fit for him when he is become a man, at the age of twenty years
there is another given him; and when he comes to that of fifty five or sixty, he receives a
third name, such as was not fit for youth or a less advanc'd age.</p>
                     <p>The departure of great Lords is commonly attended by the voluntary execution of
twenty or thirty Vassals or Slaves, who rip up their bellies and die with their Masters.
These are oblig'd to this by an Oath, and it is done partly by way of acknowledgment of
the particular kindness which their Lords had for them. Having acquainted their Lord,
that they are willing to be oblig'd to sacrifice themselves in that manner when occasion
shall require, they entertain him with a short discourse to this purpose; <hi>Most mighty Sir,
you have many other slaves and servants, of whose affection and fidelity you are assur'd; who
am I, or what have I deserv'd, that you should honour me with your favour above any of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47786:268"/>
rest? I resign up this life to you, which is already yours, and promise you, I will keep it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then it shall be serviceable to yours.</hi> Then the Lord and the Vassal take off, each of
them, a Bowl of Wine, which is the most Religious Ceremony they have among them, to
confirm their Oaths, which thereby become inviolable.</p>
                     <p>To do this execution upon themselves,<note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all the nearest of their Kindred, who conduct them to the <hi>Mesquite</hi> or <hi>Pagode,</hi> where they
sit down upon Mats and Garments, wherewith they cover all the floor, and having spent
some time in making good chear, they rip up their bellies, cutting them cross, so as that all
the guts come out; and if that does not dispatch them, they thrust themselves into the
throat, and so compleat the execution. Nay, there are some, who coming to hear that
their Masters intend to build some Edifice, either for himself or the Emperour, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him to do them the honour, that they may be laid under the Foundations, which
they think are made immoveable by that voluntary Sacrifice; and if their request be
granted, they chearfully lay themselves down at the Foundation, and have great Stones
cast upon them, which soon put them out of all pain. But it is for the most part Despair
which puts them upon this resolution; in as much as these are of that kind of Slaves,
who are so cruelly treated, that death were more supportable to them then the wretched
life they lead.</p>

but wretchedly done, as to proportions. They have also Statues in their <hi>Pagodes,</hi>

Every Street hath two Gates, which are shut up in the night, and a Watch kept
at them: as also two Officers, who are accountable for the disorders committed in their
Quarter, and speak to the Judge, about any thing wherein the Inhabitants of the Streets,
whereof they have the oversight, are any way concern'd; there being, it seems, such order
taken, that all persons are not permitted to present themselves indifferently before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,

not the raising of any Impositions or Taxes, of any nature whatsoever. Nor is it to be

which consume, where-ever they come, all the Fruit which the Hail hath left on the
Trees, in so much that they leave not any verdure on them. They only pay a small chief
Rent for their Houses, which the great Lords receive yearly, but it amounts not to above
thirty shillings for the greatest, those of the middle sort ten, and the ordinary ones twenty
pence. The Inhabitants are, besides these, oblig'd to certain dayes works, and to find a man
for their Lord, to do what business he hath to put him upon; but this happens not above
twice or thrice a moneth, and is but for an hour or two, or at most but for half a day. By
this means the Lord lives upon his Demes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Traffick, the Tradesman by his Trade, and the Husbandman by his Labour.</p>
                     <p>One of the most considerable parts of these Lords Revenues consists in Fishing, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that of the Whale, which the Emperour gives them. There are taken every year about

to death, and that by way of Justice, he himself being the Judge; but to others
Justice is administred, all over the Country, in the Emperours name. Gentlemen and
Souldiers have the priviledge to be their own Executioners, and to rip up their bellies
themselves: but others are forc'd to receive their death from the hands of the common
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47786:269"/>
Executioner. They alledge, as a reason for this proceeding of theirs, that Merchants are,
in some respect, infamous, in as much as they are, for the most part, Lyars, and deceive those
that trust them. Tradesmen they sleight, as being only but publick servants; and the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santry
is contemptible, by reason of the wretched condition they live in, which is little
better then that of Slaves. Only the Gentlemen and Souldiers are best respected, and live
at the charge, and upon the labour of others.</p>
                     <p>No offence,<note place="margin">Gaming a Crime.</note> though never so small, but is punish'd with death, but especially Theft, though
it were but for a Penny. Gaming, whether that which depends upon chance, or requires
skill, is capital among them, if it be for money; and he who kills another, though inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,
and in his own defence, is to die without mercy; with this only difference, that such
as kill in their own defence, as also they who commit such Faults or Offences, as would not
here be punished with death, die only themselves, but other Offenders involve all their
Kindred in their misfortune;<note place="margin">All the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Offenders die with them.</note> so that for the Crime of one single person, the Father, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and Children are put to death, the Wives and Daughters are made Slaves, and the
Estate of the whole Family is confiscated. And this happens so frequently, that there are
Commissioners expresly appointed for the administration of what is so confiscated; yet
does not the money raised thereby go to the King, but is imployed in the building of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godes,</hi>
and the repairing of High-wayes and Bridges.</p>

the guilty to be condemned. They take a piece of Iron, about a finger thick, and a foot
square, and make it red hot, and as soon as the redness is gone, and the Iron return'd to its
own colour, they put it to the hands of the party accused, upon two sheets of Paper,
which immediately flame, and if the accused person can cast the piece of Iron upon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Hurdle standing near him, without burning himself, he is dismissed; but if his hands
are ever so little touched by the Fire, he is sentenc'd to die. This Crime is punish'd with
a particular kind of death. The Criminal is tied with a Straw-rope, by the Neck, to a
great Cane, overthwart which they put two other Canes, much after the manner of a <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>-Cross,
whereto they fasten the Feet and the Hands, and then the Executioner runs
him through with a Pike, from the right Side up to the left Shoulder, and from the left
Side to the right Shoulder: so that being twice run through the heart, he is soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd.
Sometimes they only fasten the Malefactor with his Back to a Post, and they
make him stretch forth his Hands, which are held out by two Men, and then the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
standing behind him, runs him in at the Neck, and so into the Heart, and dispatches
him in a moment.</p>
                     <p>The Lords have such an absolute power over their menial Servants, that there needs but
a pretence to put them to death. An example of this happened not long since; a Servant
had the insolence to address himself to a Gentleman, to proffer his service to him, but ask'd
greater Wages then he knew the other was able to give, purposely to abuse him. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
perceiving the impudence of the Raskal, was a little troubled at it, but smother'd
his indignation, and only told him, that his demands were very great, but that he had so
good an opinion of him, that he must needs be a good Servant. Accordingly he kept him
a while; but one day charging him with some neglect, and reproaching him, that when he
should have been about his business, he had been idling about the City, he put him to death.
The Gentlemen and Souldi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

highly conceited of themselves, most of them keep Servants, though only to carry their
Shoes after them, which are indeed but as it were a pair of Soles, made of Straw or Rushes,
having a hole towards the toe, which keeps them on their feet.</p>
                     <p>The Crimes for which all of the Family or kindred are put to death,<note place="margin">The Crimes for which all the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred are put to death.</note> are Extortion,
Coyning, setting of Houses on fire, ravithing of Women, premeditated murther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If a
Mans Wife be guilty of any Crime her Husband is convicted of, she dies with him, but if
she be innocent, she is made a Slave. Their punishments bear no proportion to the Crimes
committed, but are so cruel, that it were not easie to express the barbarism thereof. To
consume with a gentle Fire, or only with a Candle, to crucifie with the Head downwards,
to boyl Men in seething Oyl or Water, to quarter and draw with four Horses, are very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
punishments among them.</p>
                     <p>One who had undertaken to find Timber and Stones for the building of a Palace for the
King, and had corrupted the Officers appointed by his Majesty to receive and register what
he should send in, was crucified with his head downwards. The officers were condemn'd
to rip up their bellies; but the Merchant was put to the foresaid death. He had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of an honest man, and was one that had had occasion to obliege several Persons of
Quality; in so much that some resolved to petition the Emperour for his pardon, though
these intercessions for condemn'd persons be in some sort criminal; and indeed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47786:269"/>
took it so ill, that the Lords, who had presented their Petition for him, had no other
answer thereto, but the reproaches he made to them of their imprudence.</p>
                     <p>It happened in the year 1638.<note place="margin">A horrid execution.</note> That a Gentleman, on whom the King had bestowed the
Government of a little Province, near <hi>Iedo,</hi> so oppressed the Country people, that they
were forc'd to make their complaints thereof to the Court, where it was ordered, that the
said Gentleman, and all his Relations, should all have their bellies ripp'd up on the same
day, and as near as might be at the same hour. He had a Brother, who lived two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
fourty and seven Leagues from <hi>Iedo,</hi> in the service of the King of <hi>Fingo;</hi> an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,

a Grand-son, who serv'd the King of <hi>Massamme,</hi> a hundred and ten Leagues
from <hi>Iedo;</hi> and at three hundred and eighty Leagues from <hi>Satsuma,</hi> another Son, who
serv'd the Governour of the Castle of <hi>Quanto;</hi> two Brothers, who were of the Regiment
of the Emperours Guard; and another Son, who had married the only Daughter of a rich
Merchant near <hi>Iedo;</hi> yet were all these persons to be executed precisely at the same hour.
To do that, they cast up what time were requisite to send the Order to the farthest
place, and having appointed the day for the execution there, Orders were sent to the
Princes of all the forementioned places, that they should put to death all those persons
upon the same day, just at noon, which was punctually done. The Merchant, who had
bestowed his Daughter on that Gentlemans Son, died of grief, and the Widow starv'd her
self.</p>

                     <p>The forementioned punishments are only for Gentlemen, Souldiers, Merchants, and some
other persons of mean quality: but Kings, Princes and great Lords are ordinarily punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more cruelly then if they were put to death. For they are banished into a little Island
named <hi>Faitsensima,</hi> which lies fourteen Leagues from the Province of <hi>Iedo,</hi> and is but a
League about. It hath neither Road nor Haven, and it is so steepy all about, that no
doubt it was with the greatest danger imaginable, that the first who got up to it made a
shift to do it. Those who first attempted to climb it up, found means to fasten great Poles
in certain places, whereto they have tyed ropes, with which they draw up those that are
sent thither, and make fast the boats, which otherwise would split against the Rocks with
the first Wind. There grows nothing in all the Island, but a few Mulberry-trees, so that
they are obliged to send in provisions for the subsistance of the Prisoners. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
every moneth, as is also the Garrison kept there, but they are dieted very sparingly,
as being allow'd only a little Rice, some roots, and other wretched fare. They hardly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
them a lodging over their heads, and with all these miseries, they oblige them to keep
a certain number of Silk-worms, and to make a certain quantity of Stuffs every year.</p>

                     <p>The Castle of <hi>Iedo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jedo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</note> which is the place of his ordinary residence, is near two Leagues in
compass, and is fortified with three Walls, and as many Moats, very deep, and built of
Free-stone, but so irregular, that it is impossible to assign it any certain Figure. Within
less then three hundred paces, a Man must pass through eight or nine Gates, not one of
them standing opposite to another; for being come within the first, he must turn on the
right hand to go to the second, and being come within that on the left hand to go to the
third, and so alternately till he comes to the last. Just within the last Gate there is a
Magazine of Arms, for three or four thousand men, on which about all the Streets, which
are fair and broad, having on both sides many magnificent Palaces. The Gates are done
over with great Iron bars, and over every Gate there is a House, wherein two or three
hundred Souldiers may be lodg'd. The Emperours Palace stands in the midst of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
and hath belonging to it many Appartments, Halls, Chambers, Closets, Galleries, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
Orchards, Groves, Ponds, Rivers, Fountains, Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and several particular Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
for his Wives and Concubines.</p>

                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:47786:270"/>
At your coming out of the Palace, you go into that quarter, where the Princes of the
Bloud,<note place="margin">The Palaces of the Kings.</note> and Counsellers of State live, and thence into another quarter, where are the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Kings and great Lords of <hi>Iapan,</hi> which are all gilt both within and without;
and the more sumptuously built out of this respect; that there is a certain emulation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, who shall be at greatest expence to please the Emperour. In the next quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to this, there live other Princes and Lords, who are not so powerful as the former, yet
have their Palaces gilt, and so richly furnish'd, that a Man would think, at his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in, he met with Mountains of Gold. In this quarter there live some of the Wives
and eldest Sons of those Princes, whom the Emperour hath brought up in the sight of the
Court, as so many Hostages of their Fathers fidelity: so that this Castle, though as big as
a considerable City, yet is so full of people, that the Streets can hardly contain them.</p>
                     <p>When the Emperour goes out of his Palace,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</note> he either rides on horse-back, or is carried in
a <hi>Palanquin,</hi> open of all sides, and he is accompany'd by a great number of Lords, whom
they call the Emperours <hi>Camarades.</hi> These Lords are of great quality, and very rich, yet
do they not think it any dishonour, to apply themselves to such things as are either neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
or delightful. Some are skill'd in Musick, some in Physick, some are excellent at Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or Painting, others study eloquence and the mannagement of Affairs. Next them
there goes a part of the Guard, which consists altogether of persons cull'd out among the
Children of younger Brothers, Cousins, or Kinsmen of great Lords, among whom there
are also some natural Children of such as either actually are in employments, or may, upon
presumption of their Birth, pretend thereto. Then follow the ordinary Guard, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by their Colonels and other Officers, who so dispose thereof, that two or three
thousand march before the Emperour, and as many after him. Among so many Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
there is not one but there hath been some trial made of his courage, nor any that hath
not gone through all the necessary exercises, in order to such a kind of life, and whose coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and demeanour is not answerable to the employment they are put into. They
leave a space between them and the Emperour for a great number of other great Lords,
who are about his Majesties person, who must needs make a strange shew, among five or six
hundred Men, all clad in black, some on horse-back, some afoot, all marching with such gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and so orderly, that there is not only any one man to be seen out of his rank, but a
man hears not so much as a word spoken. The Streets are swept, and strew'd with Sand
or Gravel, and the doors of all the houses standing open: yet is there not a person to be
seen, either in the shops, or at the windows; or if it happen there be, the Guard makes
them kneel till such time as the Emperour is passed by.</p>
                     <p>Once every five year,<note place="margin">The <hi>Dayro</hi>
                        </note> the Emperour goes to <hi>Meaco,</hi> to do reverence to the <hi>Dayro,</hi> who is
the true Prince of <hi>Iapan,</hi> and still hath the quality, but without any function. There is a
whole year spent in making all things ready for that journey, whereof we shall hereafter
give a particular description, and Orders are issued out to the Lords who are to follow,
and who accordingly come at the day appointed to the places where they are to meet the
King; dividing themselves so, as that some go before, to relieve such as come from the
Court, so to prevent the disorder and confusion, which were unavoidable among so great a
number of Princes, who are all oblig'd to make their appearance upon this occasion, with
all the bravery and magnificence they can.</p>
                     <p>From the City of <hi>Iedo,</hi> to that of <hi>Meaco,</hi> there are a hundred and twenty five Leagues,
and within every three or four Leagues there is a considerable City,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.</note> able to lodge the whole
Court; yet hath the Emperour caused to be built between those two places, at an equal
distance one from the other, eight and twenty fair Houses, of which there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

as Gentlemen, Guards, Horses, Officers, and Servants, with Provisions necessary for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the whole Train. They who go along with the Emperour, from the City of
<hi>Iedo,</hi> leave him to the care of those whom they find in the first House; These accompany
and conduct him to the second; and so from one to another, till he comes to the City of
<hi>Meaco;</hi> in his return from whence, he observes the same order, being attended from one
House to another, till he comes to <hi>Iedo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperours of <hi>Iapan</hi> build many of these Castles, and have them finish'd in so
short a time, that they will have a Structure compleated in six moneths, which in <hi>Europe</hi>
would take up as many years. We have an Instance of it in the Castle which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
had built in the year 1636. in the Province of <hi>Nicko,</hi> four dayes journey from the City
of <hi>Iedo.</hi> It is fortified with a double Moat, and a double Rampier, and both of Free-stone,
and it is so spacious, and consists of so many particular Palaces, for the Grandees of
the Court, and so many Appartments, Gardens and Fountains for the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that the best Architect in <hi>Europe</hi> would not have finish'd it in several years; yet
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47786:270"/>
was this great building compleated in less than five months: there were so many Masons,
Carpenters, Joyners, Stone-cutters, Gilders, Painters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> employ'd about it. This Castle
is so far within the Countrey, that the Emperour lodges there but once a year, when he goes
to do his Devotions at his Father's Sepulchre, which is thereabouts, upon which occasion
he stays there two nights.</p>
                     <p>His Treasures are so great,<note place="margin">His Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</note> that it is impossible to give any thing near an exact account
of it, inasmuch as the Gold and Silver is lock'd up in Chests, and dispos'd into the Towers
of the Castle, besides what is in several places, up and down the Countrey, where it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
almost to infinity, since the Revenue of two months, will defray the charges of a whole
years expence. The late Emperour, Father to him who now reigns, lying on his death-bed,
call'd for his Son, and told him, That the Kingdom, and all the Treasures would
beere long at his disposal, but he recommended to his particular care certain Chests and
Cabinets, where he should find the ancient Chronicles of the Kingdom, and several excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Books of Morality, as also the Crown-jewels, exhorting him highly to esteem them,
as himself and his Predecessours had done, The pieces he had so much recommended to
his Son, were, one kind of Cymitar, called <hi>Iejuky Massamme;</hi> another Cymitar, of a kind cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Brother, King of <hi>Mico,</hi> a Cymitar, called <hi>Sandame,</hi> and a Manuscript, named <hi>Sinche.</hi> And
though his six Pieces are not to be compar'd to those he bequeath'd his Son, yet not any
one of them but was valued at above a thousand <hi>Oebans</hi> of Gold, which amount to forty
seven thousand <hi>Thayls,</hi> or crowns. The Legacies he gave several Princes and Princesses of
the Blood, and other Lords and Ladies, as also to some of the Soldiery, and his Servants,
amounted to thirty six millions.</p>

death of his Father, which proceeded from his detestable addiction to Sodomy; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the <hi>Dayro,</hi> perceiving the aversion he had conceiv'd for women was such, that
the State would in all likelihood come to be without a Governour, made choice, among

of extraordinary beauty, whom he sent to the Emperour, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so debauch'd him, that he treated her with such indifference, that it brought her into a
melancholy which had almost cost her her life. Her Nurse troubled to see her in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
took one day the freedom to tell the King, that she could not comprehend, how
he could slight one of the greatest beauties in the world, to pursue those irregular enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

merry and in a good humour, was so troubled at this discourse, that going immediately
into another room, he sent for several Architects and Undertakers of Buildings, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to build a Castle fortifi'd with several Moats and Draw-bridges, and very
high Walls, in which he confin'd his Wife, with her Nurse, and all the Women and Maids
belonging to them. The Emperour's own Nurse, who had a greater influence upon him,
then his Mother, perceiving that there would be a want of Heirs to inherit the Crown,
bethought her of a course to remedy that inconvenience, which was, to get to Court all the
handsomest young maids in the Kingdom, whom she produced, as often as the Emperour's
good humour gave her occasion or encouragement to do it. Of all she brought, only the
Daughter of an Armourer insinuated her self into his affection, and was got with child
by him; but the other Ladies troubled to see a maid of so mean quality preferr'd before
them, found means to corrupt the midwife, and to kill the child, so secretly, that the
Emperour never had the least knowledge thereof.</p>

towards him, so far were they from taking up Arms to disturb the Peace of the Countrey.
His person was accounted so sacred, that they would not have it touch the ground, or that
he should be uncover'd abroad. Whence it came, that when the other Princes were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in a war one against another, there was a General named, who acted in the <hi>Dayro's</hi>
name, and reduc'd the Rebells to their duty. They have still the same respect for the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47786:271"/>
                        <hi>Dayro,</hi> insomuch, that they permit not that his hair or beard should be cut, or his nails
par'd, nor his meat to be dress'd in Pots that had been used before. He hath twelve Wives,
which are bestowed on him with extraordinary Ceremonies and Magnificence. When ever
he goes abroad, his twelve Wives follow him in so many Coaches, which are gilt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with their Arms and devises. They are lodg'd in twelve great Pallaces, built in the
street which goes to the King's Palace, and having adjoyning to them several other fair hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for his Concubines. Not one of these Women, but hath a great Supper made every
night at her Palace, at which there is Musick, and the Women-dancers; but assoon as the
King is gone into that Palace where he intends to pass away the night, they all send in
their suppers, and have their divertisements at that Ladies Lodgings, whom the King is
pleas'd to honour with his presence.</p>
                     <p>One of the greatest Ceremonies and Magnificences to be seen in <hi>Iapan,</hi>

Lords of the Countrey, and of nearest kin to the <hi>Dayro,</hi> who, for want of Issue male,
might succeed him. These Princes and Ladies receive those designed for this employment,
give them extraordinary Titles, and treat them a whole day together. The next day the
foresaid number is reduc'd to the moyety, and one half is dismiss'd, with very great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents.
The next day, they add to the Titles of those who stay, with great Ceremonies, and
their number is reduc'd to ten, and afterwards to three, the rest being still dismiss'd with
Presents, and at the end of three days, they make choyce of one of these three, on whom
they bestow, besides several other Titles, the quality of the Prince's Nurse. In order to
her establishment in that Function, she is brought into the Prince's Chamber, whom she
finds in the arms of one of the chiefest Ladies of the Countrey, by whom he had been kept
from the time of his birth; and after the Nurse hath spurted a little of her milk into the
Childes mouth, he is delivered up to her. All these Ceremonies, as also those performed
at the ordinary Feasts, are very great, and they are at this day performed with the <hi>Dayro,</hi>
who still enjoys a very considerable Revenue, sufficient to defray all the charge, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
the same grandeur his Predecessours have been possess'd of, though the force of the
Empire hath been devolv'd into other hands, as we shall now relate.</p>
                     <p>The charge of General of the Army was heretofore the greatest of any in the Kingdom,<note place="margin">A revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Japan</hi>
                        </note>
as is that of <hi>Constable,</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and it was invested ordinarily, though contrary to the
rules of good policy, in the second Son of the <hi>Dayro.</hi> About a hundred and twenty
years since, it happened there was a <hi>Dayro,</hi> who having a son he exceedingly doted on,
would needs out of an imprudent compliance he had for the Mother, consent that he should
participate of the Royal Dignity; and it was ordered that it should pass alternately from
one to the other, every three years. But the son willing to make his advantage of the
occasion, found means so to insinuate himself into the affections of the great Lords and the
Soldiery, during the three years of his Reign, that he resolv'd to continue it, contrary to
the exhortations of his Father, who too late repented him of his devesting himself of an
authority which indeed is not communicable. This was the first disturbance that ever
had been seen in <hi>Iapan,</hi> inasmuch as both Father and Son being equally invested with the
quality of <hi>Dayro,</hi> the people conceived they might, without any crime, take up Arms for
either: However most of the Lords detesting the ingratitude of the Son, joyn'd with the
General, whom the Father had appointed to reduce his Son to obedience, who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
and killed in that Civil warr. The General, finding himself well established in his
charge, followed the example of the Prince, and abusing the lawful power, whereof he
was seized, made his advantage of it to settle himself in the Throne, after the <hi>Dayro's</hi> death,
yet leaving the lawful heir, with the quality of <hi>Dayro,</hi> all the outward appearance of his
former greatness. This demeanour of the Generall's occasioned a second Civil warre,
which was thought the more just, out of this respect, that in this the people took up
Arms against an Usurper, who had not the quality of <hi>Dayro,</hi> nor consequently the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
for which the <hi>Iaponnesses</hi> have so great a veneration. Accordingly, this war had
the same success with the former;<note place="margin">A Souldier of Fortune gets to be General of the Army.</note> for the Usurper was defeated and executed. But this
second General took the same course as his Predecessour had done, so that by this second
Usurpation, the Countrey was reduced to an absolute Anarchy, wherein all were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
there being no Prince, nor Lord, nay hardly a Village, but was engaged in war
against some other. These disorders gave occasion to a Soldier of Fortune, named <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cko,</hi>
to appear at first, in the head only of fifty men, with whom he did such exploits, that
he soon improved that handful to a very considerable Army.</p>
                     <p>His first adventures were the taking in of several Castles and small Cities; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47786:271"/>
a while after, his thoughts flew much higher, and he proved so fortunate in his designs,
that within less then three years,<note place="margin">And Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</note> he became absolute Master of the whole State. He left
the <hi>Dayro</hi> the external part of his former greatness, and thought it enough to be in effect,
what the other was only in appearance. The <hi>Dayro,</hi> on the other side, perceiving it was
impossible for him to prevent that establishment, comply'd therewith, and chang'd the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>General</hi> of the Army to that of <hi>Emperour. Taycko,</hi> who could not expect much qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness
in his newly acquired fortune, if he removed not those Lords of whom he conceived
any jealousie, resolved to keep them at a distance from the Court; and to that end, he sent
the chiefest of them with an Army of sixty thousand men, into the Countrey of <hi>Corea,</hi> with
order not to return thence till they had conquered that Province. They there met with
such resistance, that they were near seven years reducing that Nation to obedience: <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cko</hi>
in the mean time feeding them with fair hopes, and animating them to prosecute
a design of so great concernment to the State. They were forc'd to obey; but being
impatient to return to their own habitations, they committed such exorbitances as made

<hi>Dayro.</hi> The disorders of the late Civil Warrs were yet fresh in every mans memory, so
that there was a general joy conceiv'd, to see the Regency in the hands of a person, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
qualified for the execution thereof. <hi>Ongosschio</hi> was indeed a person of very great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
but he had withal too much spirit and ambition to be reduced to a private life,
after he had been possessed of the Soveraign Power for so many years. He had obliged <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery</hi>
to marry his Daughter, yet could not so near an alliance smother so that predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
passion in him. Whence it came that he immediately gave out, that <hi>Fidery</hi> was
grown so distrustful of him, that he was forc'd to stand upon his guard, and to raise an
Army to oppose that which <hi>Fidery</hi> was going to get together against him. He gave out
also that <hi>Fidery</hi> would needs be treated as Emperour, and discharge the Functions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
before the <hi>Dayro</hi> had acknowledged him to be such, or Crown'd him in that quality.
Accordingly he took his march with a powerful Army, raised in the Kingdom of <hi>Suruga,</hi>
towards the City of <hi>Ozacka,</hi> where <hi>Fidery</hi> lived, and after a siege of three months, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to so great extremities, that <hi>Fidery</hi> sent his Wife, who as we said before, was
<hi>Ongosschio's</hi> daughter, to intreat her Father to grant him his life, and to sign him such
Lands in any Province of the Kingdom as he should think fit, where he might live
privately: But <hi>Ongosschio</hi> would not see his daughter, and continuing his siege, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
at last Master of the Castle.</p>
                     <p>The unfortunate <hi>Fidery</hi> being got,<note place="margin">Puts to death the Heir of the Cown.</note> with his wives, and several other persons of Quality,
in one of the Palaces; <hi>Ongosschio</hi> ordered it to be compassed about with great piles of
wood, which being set on fire, the Pallace and all within was reduced to ashes. He put
to death all the Lords who had sided, or held any correspondency with <hi>Fidery,</hi> and by
that means established himself the sole Monarch of that State, as <hi>Taycko,</hi> his Predecessour,
had done before him. <hi>Ongosschio</hi> died the year following, and left the Empire in quiet,
to his Son <hi>Combo,</hi> or <hi>Combosamme,</hi> the Father of <hi>Chiongon,</hi> who now Reigns.</p>
                     <p>It is no hard matter for the Emperour of <hi>Iapan</hi> to raise and keep an Army on foot,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> raises h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to this accompt, the Lord of <hi>Firando,</hi> (where the <hi>Dutch</hi> made their first establishment)
who hath sixty thousand <hi>Kockiens</hi> of yearly Revenue, was tax'd at twelve hundred foot,
and one hundred and twenty horse, besides the servants, slaves, and what else is consequent
thereto. So that by this means, according to the Revenues of the Lords we mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which amount to eighteen millions, and four hundred thousand <hi>Kockiens,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47786:272"/>

eight thousand eight hundred horse,<note place="margin">Can raise 368000. foot, and 38800. horse.</note> not accounting the hundred thousand foot and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand horse, which he is able to maintain out of his own Revenue, and which he
keeps as a standing Army, for the defence of his Castles and strong places, and for his Guards.</p>
                     <p>Most of these Lords find it no great trouble to make their Levies, for there are few of
them but ordinarily maintain twice as many Soldiers, out of an humour they have to make
great showes, especially upon those occasions wherein they expect to give some assurances
of their courage or zeal they have for the service of their Prince.</p>
                     <p>Their Cavalry is armed with Corselets,<note place="margin">Their Arms.</note> but the Foot have only Head-pieces. The offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Arms of the Horse are a sort of Fire-locks, not much longer then our Pistols, half-pikes,
Bowes, Arrows, and Cimitars. The foot wear every man two Cimitars, and have
Muskets, Pikes, and <hi>Nanganets,</hi> or half-pikes, and every man hath about him a very broad
Knife. Their Companies consist but of fifty Soldiers, who are commanded by a Captain,
a Lieutenant,<note place="margin">Their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies and Regiments.</note> and ten Corporals, to wit, a Corporal for every five Soldiers. Five Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
make a Body, which is commanded by another Officer, and every fifty Companies have
their Colonel. The Emperour of <hi>Iapan</hi> hath the same course taken, to know every year
how many persons there is in his Kingdom. For every quarter of a City or Village is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into Cantons, consisting of five houses, which are commanded by a certain Officer,
who keeps a Register or Catalogue of all those who die or are born within the five houses
under his jurisdiction, and reports the same to his superiours, who give an account thereof
to the Prince or Lord of the Province; and these last to two Counsellors of State, who
are appointed for that purpose.</p>
                     <p>The Council of State consists of several Lords,<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State.</note> who have each of them his particular
function, excepting only the four chiefest, who are every day punctually at Court to give
the Emperour an account of affairs. All the rest are so powerful and rich, that some among
them have above two millions of yearly Revenue, others three or four hundred thousand
Crowns, others but forty or fifty thousand. They are very reserv'd in the advice they give
the Emperour, to whom they speak not, even of affairs, if they find him not in a good
humour to hear them: but none will presume to speak to him twice of the same thing,
or renew his intreaties, after a refusal. This Council consists of such Lords as the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
may be the more confident of, in regard they have commonly their education at the
Court. These have the management of all publick affairs, but with such dependance on
the Soveraign's pleasure, that they do not only never resolve on any things of themselves,
but indeed they never speak to the Prince, till he gives them some occasion to do it, and
that they have first consulted his eyes, and studied his countenance, to find what his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
are. They ever approve what he says, though never so prejudicial to himself,
even to the loss of a whole Province; for the least contestation would cost them their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
if not their lives.</p>
                     <p>From what we said before,<note place="margin">The expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of great Lords.</note> it is evident, that the Reyenues of these Lords are very
great; but their Expences are as great. For, first, not one of them but is obliged to
live one halfe of the year at Court, and, during that time, to keep house in the chief City of
<hi>Iedo,</hi> where he who lives at the highest rate is most in favour with the Emperour. The
first six months in the year, those Lords who have their Principalities and Lordships
in the Easterly and Northerly Provinces of the Kingdom, continue at the Court, and the
other six months, those that live in the Western and Southern Provinces. At their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Court, and their departure thence, they make very considerable Presents to the
Emperour, and great Entertainments among themselves. Their Journeys and their
Expences at Court, whither some Lords bring a Retinue of five or six thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
lie very heavy on the richest, and ruine the rest. The Lord of <hi>Firando,</hi> who, as we
said, was one of the meanest, had in his Family, above three hundred men, and maintain'd
in the two houses he had at <hi>Iedo,</hi> above a thousand persons, comprehending in that
number the VVomen and Concubines he kept, as did also the other Lords, in one of
his two houses.</p>
                     <p>Provisions are dear enough all over <hi>Iapan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Provisions dear.</note> but at an excessive rate about the Court,
by reason of the abundance consumed by so great a number of persons of quality. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way to exhaust their Estates is, their magnificence in Building, there being still some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
wanting in their appartments, either as to Painting or Gilding, or the like. Most of
their Domesticks go in Silk, especially their Women, and those of their own sex that
wait on them: so that there is hardly any Lord but spends more then his Revenue amounts
to. But what helps to ruine them, is the Order they receive from the Emperour, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
him, ever and anon, with men and mony, to carry on the publick Buildings, which he
does rather to drain the Purses of these Lords, then out of any necessity obliging him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>

The greatest Lords, when they build a Pallace, do ordinarily make two Gates thereto,
one for their own use,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of the weather, and is not uncover'd, till near the time of the Emperour intends to honour
the house with his presence, to dine there; and assoon as he is departed thence, it is shut up,
and so kept ever after, out of this respect, that having serv'd for a passage to the Emperour's
Sacred Majesty, it were a profanation, if any private person should pass through it after him.
It is also to be observ'd that the Emperour never dines above once in any house belonging
to another man, and that they are three whole years in making all things ready for his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.
Accordingly he hath notice of it, three years before, and in the mean time
all the furniture of the house is made and marked,<note place="margin">Three years requisite to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and Characters of the Emperour; and after that time they are never more used, but kept
very safe, as things not to be employed in any thing, after they have once served the
Soveraigns person. So that this Expence, and that which they are at in the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which the Master of that House is obliged to make for the whole Court, for three
months together, were enough to beggar an ordinary King.</p>
                     <p>Another thing lies heavy on these Lords, is, the Presents which the Emperour makes
them. For upon his return from his ordinary Hunting, which is that of the Crane, a bird
there very highly esteemed, he is wont to send some of those he hath taken, to such as he
hath most kindness for. But that Present costs him at least half a years Revenue, in Feasts,
Presents, and other publick Entertainments, which he is obliged to make in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the favour done him by his Majesty, in sending him a Bird taken by a Hawk
put off from his Sacred Hands. It is not long since, that the Lord of <hi>Zatiuma</hi> treated
the Emperour at a Dinner, in a Palace which was then but newly finished; but he got
well by the expence he had been at. For the Emperour made him a Present for his Horses,
(so they call the Gratifications he makes his Favourites) by an addition to his former
Revenue, of two hundred and fifty thousand Crowns <hi>per annum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Grandees never take any Wife,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour marries all the great Lords.</note> but what they have from the Emperours hands;
and it is of her alone who is given by him, that the Children are to be born, who are to
inherit their Estates. Accordingly, they look on her and respect her as the person from
whom they expect Heirs for the propagation of their Family, and upon that account, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to them by the Emperour. He who expects to have this honour done him
builds a Palace purposely for her reception, furnishes it very richly, and allows her a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
consisting of a great number of Women and Maids, to accompany her, and wait on her.</p>
                     <p>Women go not abroad but once a year,<note place="margin">The women kept in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.</note> to give their Relations a Visit, and then they
are seen in the streets, with a Retinue of thirty, forty, or fifty close <hi>Palanquins,</hi> wherein
are carried so many Maids of Honour, accompanied each of them by their Waiting Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen,
and other Women, marching in a File on both sides of the <hi>Palanquins,</hi> which
are varnished over and gilt. All the remainder of the year, the women stir not out of their
houses, into which there are not any men permitted to enter, save only some of the Wives
nearest Relations, who sometimes have the freedom to see them, but very seldom, and that
in their Husbands presence. It is his business on the other side to make the restraint as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
burthensom as may be to them, by allowing them all the divertisements and recreations,
which honest women can take; finding them Gardens and Parks for walking, Ponds for
fishing, keeping all sorts of living Creatures for their pleasure, and entertaining them
every day with Musick and Plays. But they must expect to end their days in this restraint,
and renounce the conversation of men, inasmuch as the least suspition is here as unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
punished with death, as any other manifest crime; not only in the person of the
Lady, but also in all about her. Her Attendants are commonly some of the handsomest
young Gentlewomen in the Province, who always stand before the Master and Mistress
with such respect, that they study to answer, laugh, and hold their peace, upon the least
sign made them. They are ordinarily distinguished into Bands or Companies, consisting
of sixteen Gentlewomen, who have each a Governess over them. They are clad in Silk,
flower'd painted, or embroidered, of different colours or liveries. For one Band is in a
red livery, with girdles and head-cloathes of a green colour; another, white, with girdles
and head-cloathes red; another, yellow, with girdles and head-cloaths of a sky-colour, and
so of the rest. The Gentlewomen, who are received into the service of these Princesses,
at fifteen or twenty years of age, oblige themselves, most of them, for the remainder of
their lives; but such as are taken into it while they are yet children, are sometimes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
married to Gentlemen, Soldiers, or others of the menial Servants, who have some
Office about the House, and whose Allowances are upon that Account augmented: but such
as are not married at thirty, must not expect to change their condition, otherwise then by
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47786:273"/>
being advanced to some more honourable Employments among the women.</p>
                     <p>It is the custom of the Countrey,<note place="margin">Women ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver talk of business.</note> that Women should be instructed betimes, not to meddle
with any kind of business whatsoever, insomuch that they never speak of any such thing
to their Husbands. These, on the otherside, make it their brag, that they are enabled
with such a strength of parts and understanding, as to leave all serious thoughts behind
them, at their own Lodgings, when they leave those to go into the appartment of their
Wives, where their discourse is altogether of mirth and divertisement. If a Woman
should trouble her Husband with the least discourse about business, she would immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put him out of humour, make him change his countenance, and oblige him to retire,
without so much as speaking to her. But this she will be sure to avoid, though out of
no other motive then this, that another might not have those enjoyments of him, which
she by her imprudence would deprive her self of. For they affirm, that a woman is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
on man mearly to serve, and divert him, and to mind the education of his Children,
and that herein consists all her duty, and that there are but too many Examples of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
happening through the excessive freedom heretofore allowed to women.</p>
                     <p>The Wives of <hi>Iapan</hi> have the reputation of being extreamly faithful to their Husbands,
and so modest and reserv'd, that none any where else come near them. Of this many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
might be produced: but confining our selves to the relation of a particular man's
Travels, wherein these digressions must needs be thought tedious, we shall here produce

sent for the Widdow, some days after her Husband's death, acquainted her with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
She told him, that though she had much reason to be glad, and think her self hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
in being honour'd with the friendship of so great a Prince, yet was she resolved to bite
off her Tongue, and murder her self, if he proffer'd her any violence; but if he would
grant her but one favour, which was to spend one month in bewailing her Husband, and
then give her the liberty to make an Entertainment for the relations of the deceased, to take
her leave of them, he should find how much she was his Servant, and how far she would
comply with his affection. The Prince, who thought himself sure enough of her, made
no difficulty to do what the Gentlewoman desired of him, and having provided a very great
dinner, at the place where she desired it might be, all the kindred of the deceased came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but it was only to be witnesses of the fidelity which she expressed to her husband
after his death: For the Gentlewoman perceiving the King began to be warm in his wine,
out of the hope he was in to enjoy what had been promised him, desired the liberty to
withdraw into an adjoyning Gallery to take the Air; but assoon as she was come into it,
she cast her self headlong down, in the presence of the King, and all her husbands Relations.</p>

the end of a Table, waiting on her Master, in the appartment of the Women, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching
her self to take a flaggon that stood a little too far from her, she chanced to let
wind backwards, which she was so much asham'd of, that putting her Garment over her
head, she would by no means shew her face after, but with an enrag'd violence taking one
of her nibbles into her mouth, she bit it off with such fury, that she died in the place.</p>
                     <p>Another Lord,<note place="margin">Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie.</note> having had an exact search made for all the handsome young Damosels
in his Province, to be dispos'd into his Ladies service, there was among the rest brought
him one whom he was so much taken with, that he made her his Concubine. She was the
Daughter of a poor Soldiers widdow, who hoping to make some advantage of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
good fortune, took occasion one day, to write her a large letter, wherein she express'd
what a necessitous condition she was in, and how she was forc'd to sue to her for relief.
While the Daughter was reading her Mother's Letter, her Lord comes into the room; but
being asham'd to discover her Mothers poverty, she endeavours to hide the Letter from
him, yet could she not convey it away so, as that the other did not perceive it. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
he observ'd in the Gentlewoman's countenance, made him suspect there might be
some design in it, insomuch, that he pressed her to shew him the Letter; but the more
importunate he was, the more unwilling she was to satisfie him; so perceiving there was no
way to avoid it, she thrust it into her mouth, with so much precipitation that thinking to
swallow it down, it choaked her. This so incensed the Lord; that he immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her throat to be cut, whereby they discovered only the Mothers Poverty, and the
Daughters innocence. He was so moved thereat, that he could not forbear expressing it by
tears; and it being not in his power to make any other Demonstrations of his affection to
the deceased; he sent for the Mother, who was maintained among his other Ladies, at
the time we speak of, with all imaginable respect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:47786:273"/>
They are generally so reserv'd in their conversation,<note place="margin">The reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedness of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versotien.</note> that their discourses are not only
far from being guilty of any obscene or impertinent expression, but also they will not so
much as talk of marriage, or ought relating thereto, even in honourable terms, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of young people, who, when there is any such thing spoken of, immediately rise and
go out of the Room. The Children have a great tenderness and respect for their Parents,
as being perswaded there is no sin more severely punished by the Gods, then the disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Children. They have also a certain veneration for their memory after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease;
for they religiously observe those fasting dayes they impose upon themselves of
their own accord, abstaining from whatever hath had life, upon those dayes of the moneth,
on which their Parents departed this World.</p>
                     <p>As they are very severe in restraining their Wives and Concubines of even the least li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,<note place="margin">They are jealous.</note>
so are they excessively cruel in punishing those which are not careful to preserve
their honours, or give the least suspition of their inclinations to be dishonest. It is not
long since that the Lord of <hi>Firando</hi> caused three Ladies to be put into so many Chests,
through which there were Nails struck in of all sides, one, for having prostituted her self
to a Gentleman, who ripp'd up his own belly as soon as their familiarity was discovered;
and the other two, because they had been privy to their Loves, and had not acquainted
him therewith. He who finds a Man lock'd up in the same Room with his Wife, may
kill them both; and in the Husbands absence, the Father, Brother, or any other Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
nay, any one of the menial Servants may do as much: and by this means, they so
avoid those scandals, which are but too frequent elsewhere, that a man seldom hears of
Adultery among them; in so much that I do not remember I ever heard of any more then
one Example, which being a remarkable one, I shall not think it much to insert it
here.</p>
                     <p>A certain Merchant,<note place="margin">Adultery severely punished.</note> who had some reason to suspect his Wife, pretended to go into the
Country, but returning soon after, surpriz'd her in the very act. The Adulterer he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and having ty'd his Wife to a Ladder, he left her in that half-hanging posture all night.
The next day he invited all their Relations on both sides, as well Men as Women, to dine
with him at his own house, sending them word, that the importance of the business he had
to communicate to them, excused his not-observance of the custom they have, to make
Entertainments for the Women, distinct from those of the Men. They all came, and
wondered not much that the Mistress of the house was not to be seen, in regard her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
told them that she was busie in the Kitchin: but dinner being well-nigh past, and
the Guests perceiving the Woman appear'd not, they intreated him to send for her, which
he promised to do. Whereupon rising from the Table, and going into the Room, where
she was ty'd to the Ladder, he unbound her, put a Shrowd about her, and put into her
hands a Box of <hi>Lacque,</hi> wherein were the Privy-members of her Gallant, cover'd with
Flowers, charging her not to open the Box, and saying to her, <hi>Go and present this Box to
our common Relations, and see whether I may, upon their meditation, grant you your life.</hi>
She came in that equipage into the Hall where they sate at dinner, and falling on her knees
presented the Box, with the precious Reliques within it, to the Kindred: but as soon as
they had opened it, she swounded. Her Husband perceiving it, went to her, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
her returning again, now that she was going, cut off her Head; which raised such
an horror in the Friends, that they immediately left the Room, and went to their several
homes.</p>
                     <p>To prevent these disorders,<note place="margin">Fornication permitted.</note> they have in their common Inns upon the Road, as also in
certain
places in Cities, the convenience of furnishing Travellers with a kind of Women,
who are for the most part Slaves, but very well clad in Silk, and make no difficulty to prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themselves to keep men company all night. These have the Custom of Masters of Ships
and common Sea-men that are Forreigners; but if they will bid at a little higher Game,
and be more sure of their enjoyments, they may buy a concubine, with whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
for the time they are to stay in the Country; allowing them five or six pence a day
towards their diet, a Garment or two, certain pair of Shooes of Cordevant, and about eight
or ten Crowns, for the Father, or Master, who lets her out.</p>
                     <p>We are so far from charging this Nation with being over-superstitious,<note place="margin">They have no Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> that on the other
side, we affirm, that there is no mark of Devotion to be observed among them. Those who
are conceived to have very much, go once a moneth to their <hi>Pagodes,</hi> and pronounce seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times the word <hi>Nammanda,</hi> which is the name of one of their Gods; but they are
never seen praying to God, neither morning nor evening, nor at any time of the day. There
is a certain Sect among them, which hath Priests, who preach thrice a year, to which Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
all those of the same perswasion resort. There are also some who make use of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of Ecclesiasticks, especially in their long diseases, wherein they have prayers
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47786:274"/>
made, which last twenty four hours, with such a noise, that they stunne such as come near
them, who yet cannot understand one word they say; not only in regard they pronounce
ill and confusedly; but hence, that whatever they compose, as well in matter of Religion
as Medicine, and the other Sciences, is couched in such high and obscure terms, that many
times they understand them not themselves.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding this irreligion,<note place="margin">Their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godes</hi> and Priests.</note> there are in <hi>Iapan</hi> an incredible number of <hi>Pagodes</hi> or
<hi>Mesquites,</hi> some of which have fifteen or twenty Priests belonging to them. They are
distinguished from the <hi>Laicks</hi> in that their Heads are shaved, as also by their cloathing, in
as much as they go in a kind of Cassock, made like the Frocks worn by some Country
people: but upon Holidayes they go in a sort of long Garments, which they sold up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the left Arm, like a Cloak. Their principal employment is to pray before their Gods,
and to bury the dead, or at least the ashes of such bodies as have been burnt. They are
divided into several Sects, and consequently have so many different wayes of doing their
Devotions, especially on the Anniversary dayes of the deceased, which they call <hi>Bom,</hi> on
which the Priests are employed in praying and singing Letanies, in making Processions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Chappel set about with Wax-lights, much after the same manner as is done in some
parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Their Sepulchres are near their <hi>Pagodes,</hi> covered with great Stones, two
or three foot high, on which such as go to do their Devotions there cast Flowers, or bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Trees, and put into a little Pit, made in the ground, some fair Water and a little
Rice, which is taken away thence by the poor. Persons of Quality erect a little Pillar
near their Sepulchres, and grave thereon their names, with a certain Elogy, which serves for
an <hi>Epitaph.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their Ecclesiasticks are divided into twelve principal Sects,<note place="margin">Distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sects.</note> of which eleven eat not
of any thing that hath had life, and make a Vow of Chastity, with so strict an Obligation
for the observance thereof, that if they break it, though in never so small a point, they are
put to the most cruel death that ever was heard of. For the Priest who hath broken his
Vow is put into the ground up to the Waste,<note place="margin">A cruel kind of death.</note> near the High-way; and all that pass by, who
are not nobly descended, are obliged to give a little stroke upon his Neck with a wooden
Saw, which being very blunt makes the Wretch languish three or four dayes together.
This course is taken with them, upon this account, that being permitted to use <hi>Sodomy,</hi>
they may forbear Women.</p>
                     <p>The Priests of the twelfth Sect live after another rate. For it is lawful for them to feed
on any thing that Earth or Water affords, as also to marry: and yet this Sect, which they
call <hi>Icko,</hi> whence the Priests, whereof it consists, are named <hi>Ickois,</hi> is accounted the holiest,
and most perfect of them all. He who is Head of this Sect, is also Supream Head of all
the Clergy of the Country, and is in so great veneration among his followers, that they
do not only carry him in a <hi>Palanquin,</hi> but indeed do him such honours as are almost Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.
All the Priests depend on the <hi>Dayro,</hi> who still hath the same power over the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks,
as he had heretofore, joyntly, with the secular power. Only such <hi>Pagodes</hi> as
belong to these last have a settled Revenue, and enjoy many Priviledges and Immunities
granted them by the Emperours. All the other <hi>Pagodes</hi> are maintain'd by what is given
them, either by way of Alms, or the Gratifications that they get from those who imploy
them about Prayers for the dead, wherein the main part of the exercise of their Religion
consists.</p>
                     <p>Some among them believe,<note place="margin">Their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Soul.</note> that the Soul is immortal, that the Body is reduced to its
first Principle, and becomes Dust and Ashes, but that the Spirit is either raised to eternal
joy, or condemn'd to an endless grief, and that at its return into this World, it shall find
good or evil, according to what it had done during this life. Others make no distinction
between the Souls of Men and those of Beasts, and as they have no knowledge of the
Worlds Creation, so are they ignorant that there is a time appointed for its dissolution. The
most zealous among them make no scruple to convert their <hi>Pagodes</hi> into Drinking-houses;
for, as they make choice of the most delightful places of the Country, for the <hi>Pagodes,</hi> so
they walk in them, and divert themselves, in the presence of their Gods, and have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of their Priests, drinking and debauching themselves to that height, that it proves the
occasion of many consequent disorders.</p>
                     <p>A man shall never,<note place="margin">No disputes about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> in this Country, meet with any Controversies about Religion, nor
ever find that a <hi>Iapponese</hi> conceives himself any way obliged to instruct his Neighbour, or
shew him his Errour: but on the contrary, their indifference for these concernments is
generally so great, that some among them will not stick to change their Religion for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Crowns.</p>
                     <p>They have so irreconcilable an aversion for the <hi>Christians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">They ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> that, perceiving they went
chearfully to their deaths, when they only cut off their Heads, and crucified them after
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47786:274"/>
their death, they have since found out such exquisite torments, to procure their more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
departure, that, though they had resolution and constancy enough to endure them; yet
could they not express that insolence and insensibility, as to receive so greivous a death,
with the same alacrity they had discover'd at the ordinary Executions. There were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
some who sung amidst the Flames; but it would have been somewhat above huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
if they should not have groan'd in the torments they endured, when they were broild,
with a gentle Fire, upon Gridirons, or suffer'd to languish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or several dayes together. Yet
did not all these courses much diminish the number of those Wretches; in so much that
these Monsters of barbarisme, perceiving that Death little frighten'd those who look'd on
it but as a passage to a better life,<note place="margin">Diabolical inventions to put <hi>Christians</hi> to death.</note> bethought themselves of other courses to be taken with
them. Young Maids, of any Quality, they caused to be stripp'd stark naked, to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
violated, made them go on all four through the Streets, and dragg'd them through
rugged and uneven places, till their hands and knees were cut, and their bodies torn in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places, and after all put them into Vats full of Serpents, which enter'd into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
at all the open places, and so put them to a very painful death: yet was this done
with less horrour, then when they fill'd the privy parts of a Mother or a Daughter with
Match done over with Gun-powder, and bound about those of a Son or a Father with the
same, and forced the Son to set fire to that of the Mother, and the Father to that of his
Daughter. 'Twas a kind of favour shewn them, when they cover'd their bodies all over
with Turfs, and incessantly pour'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>'d
amidst those torments, which commonly dispatch'd them not in less then three or four
dayes. They drove great companies of them up and down the Country, and into Forrests,
stigmatiz'd in the foreheads, with prohibitions, upon pain of death, that any should give
them any sustenance or entertainment. Some were put into Cages upon the Sea-side, that
the Tide might come up to their chins, and at the return of the water they might recover
their spirits a little, to endure the greater torment at the next Floud. They bound the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Mothers to a Post, and hood-winked them, while they put the Children to incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
torments, which they being not able to endure, intreated their Parents with the
most importunate expressions they could imagine at that age, to deliver them out of their
pains, by renouncing. This was one of the most insupportable punishments of any they
invented, and which brought many to death and abjuration. Another torment they
had for those poor Children was, to pluck off their Nails, and to prick them with Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins
in the tenderest parts of their bodies. To make a discovery of <hi>Christians,</hi> they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that all the Inhabitants should once a year protest before their <hi>Pagodes,</hi> and sign a
certain Instrument, whereby they renounced <hi>Christian</hi> Religion; and by this means there
passed not a year, but a great number was discover'd. Such as were hung up by the feet,
and were continued in that posture for ten or twelve dayes, endured the greatest torment
of any, in regard the anguish of this punishment still increasing, there is no pain, not even
that of fire it self, comes near it.</p>
                     <p>These persecutions must needs have much diminish'd the number of <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan;</hi>
but what most contributes to the destruction of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, is a course they
have taken, to put the <hi>Christians</hi> to death, even though they proffer to renounce; so that
there is no way for any to avoid death, but by discovering another <hi>Christian,</hi> who may
endure it in their stead, and by that discovery they escape. However, there is an
exact Register kept of these <hi>Renegadoes,</hi> out of a design, as it is conceiv'd, one time
or other, to rid the Country of them, when the Executions must cease for want of
<hi>Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the same time there was a search made for <hi>Christians</hi> in all the Hospitals for Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
where they found three hundred and eighty <hi>Christians,</hi> whom they sent away in two
Ships, to the <hi>Philippine</hi> Islands, as a Present to the <hi>Portuguez.</hi> The Leprosie is so common
a Disease in <hi>Iapan,</hi> that a man shall meet there with many, whose fingers and toes are so
rotted, that they fall off.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Christians,</hi> who are conducted to punishment, are tied; but the Priests, whether
<hi>Castilians, Portuguez,</hi> or <hi>Iaponneses,</hi> are otherwise treated. They shave off one half of
their Heads and Beards, which they paint over with a red colour, put a Gag into their
Mouths, and a Halter about their Necks, which is tied to the Horse-tail, on which they are
brought to the place appointed for their execution.</p>
                     <p>Most of their Houses are built of Wood,<note place="margin">Their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> sleightly enough, in regard the Country is very
much subject to Earthquakes. They are all raised three or four foot from the ground,
boarded and matted, and very handsom within, especially those Rooms where they reveive
their Visits. They are, for the most part, but one story high, in which they live, and the
rest serve for Corn-lofts. They have places distinct from their Houses, where they keep
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47786:275"/>
their Merchandises, and what else they most esteem, in regard their Houses are so apt to
take fire, that they are forc'd to have Fats full of Water alwayes ready against such Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
which are very frequent among them.</p>
                     <p>The Houses of Gentlemen and Souldiers are divided into two partitions, whereof one
is taken up by the Wife, who is never seen, and the other by the Husband, who hath his
Chambers and Halls for the reception of his friends and his business. The Wives of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
and Merchants appear in the Shops, and have a care of the House; but they are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with so much respect, that none durst let fall a free or equivocal expression in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
nay, a licentious one were criminal. Instead of Tapistry, they have a kind of Scenes
or Shutters, which serve them also for Pictures, whereof they cover the closures with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
painted and gilt, and so neatly pasted on, that the whole piece seems to consist but of one
sheet. These Shutters are made of very thin boards, and fall one into another, so as that
of two or three small Chambers, they can of a sudden make a very fair Hall. All these
little Rooms make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> a kind of Gallery, which serves equally for both the Appartments of
the Husband and Wife, and leads to a common Door to go into the Garden, which Door is
ordinarily opposite to the Hall-windows. In the midst of the Room there commonly
stands a Cabinet, on which they set a Pot of Flowers, which are there to be had all the
year long. They are very curious about their Gardens, and make them as pleasant as may
be, with Groves, Fountains, Orchards, and especially one kind of Tree, which is as green in
Winter as in Summer.</p>
                     <p>There is not much Houshold-Stuff to be seen in their Houses, in regard they bestow on
their Wives, the Trunks and Cabinets of <hi>Lacque,</hi> their rich Tapistry, and the like, or they
dispose them into some private Rooms, into which they admit only their most intimate
Friends. They are very expensive in their Pots for <hi>Cha,</hi> or <hi>Tsia,</hi> as also in Pictures, Pieces
excellent for the writing, and in Arms.</p>
                     <p>They are civil,<note place="margin">They are civil.</note> and entertain such as visit them with great Complements. Persons of
Quality make such as come to see them sit down, and present them with <hi>Tobacco</hi> and <hi>Tsia.</hi>
If the Master of the house hath a particular esteem for the Friend who visits him, he will
treat him with Wine, which is brought in a varnish'd Cup; and it were an incivility in
him, to whom this honour is done, to refuse it. They are not so reserv'd, but that sometimes
they will take a little more then they are well able to carry away; but seldom to that
height, as to do ought whereof they may repent the next day, or quarrel in their Drink;
for the perpetual apprehension they have of the unavoidable Death that would follow,
keeps them in, and sends them to bed with whole Skins.</p>
                     <p>In Cities, and upon the High-wayes, there are Inns, for the entertainment of Travellers
and Passengers, but otherwise there is not a Tipling-house, or Cooks-shop, in all <hi>Iapan.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">No drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houses in <hi>Japan.</hi>
                        </note>
For though there are great lovers of good chear, and company keeping, yet have they not
any publick places for that purpose, but they meet at one anothers houses, and there spend
the time in good fellowship and drinking, and have a kind of Musick, which is not very
harmonious.<note place="margin">Their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</note> They have but few Musical Instruments, and that most used among them,
and which they are most taken with, is a kind of Lute, the belly whereof is above a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>square,
with a long and narrow neck, as being made only for four strings, which are of Silk,
and they strike them with a Peg of Ivory, about the bigness of a Mans singer. They sing
to it, but the voyce is as immelodious as the sound of the Instrument.</p>
                     <p>Their Wine they make of Rice,<note place="margin">Their Wine.</note> putting thereto some Sugar or Honey, and they call it
<hi>Moursack,</hi> or <hi>Saltse.</hi> It is a kind of <hi>Hydromel,</hi> rather then Wine, yet it is as strong as the
best Sack, and makes a Man drunk much sooner.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Tsia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tsia,</hi> how prepared.</note> it is a kind of <hi>The</hi> or <hi>Tea;</hi> but the Plant is much more delicate, and more
highly esteem'd then that of <hi>Thé.</hi> Persons of Quality keep it very carefully in Earthen-pots
well stopp'd and luted, that it may not take wind: but the <hi>Iaponneses</hi> prepare it quite
otherwise then is done in <hi>Europe.</hi> For, instead of infusing it into warm water, they beat
it as small as powder, and take of it as much as will lye on the point of a Knife, and put it
into a dish of Porcelane or Earth, full of seething Water, in which they stir it, till the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be all green, and then drink it as hot as they can endure it. It is excellent good after
a debauch, it being certain there is not any thing that allayes the Vapours, and settles the
Stomack better then this Herb doth. The Pots they make use of about this kind of
Drink are the most precious of any of their Houshold-Stuffe, in as much as it is known,
that there have been <hi>Tsia</hi>-pots, which had cost between six and seven thousand pound
<hi>sterling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their Marriages are sollicited only the Relations,<note place="margin">Their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</note> who have some superiority over those
that contract them. The Father and Mother find out the party, and propose that alliance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and for want of them, others of the Kindred; so as that the young Couple know nothing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47786:275"/>
of what is done, in so much that the persons who are to be married never see one another
till the Marriage is to be consummated. This is the more easily effected, in that it is in the
Husbands power to keep what number he thinks fit of Concubines, nay, may prosecute his
enjoyments among common Prostitutes, whereas the least suspition of the Womans disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
would cost her her life. They have also the convenience of Divorce, and may send
their Wives back to their own Friends, yet conceive it no disparagement to them. True
it is, that only Persons of mean condition use it, as Merchants, Tradesmen, and common
Souldiers; and that Persons of Quality take another course, out of a respect to the Birth
and Relations of the Woman; and in case of disagreement they still maintain them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Quality. Which hinders not but that they also are most liberal of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
among their Concubines, little it seems troubled at the discontent they give their
Wives, whom they see but when they please themselves. For, certain it is, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
only are married, and that the Men are as much at liberty after, as they had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
marriage. Common Brothel-houses are allowed, and there are some Masters who buy
Slaves only to drive that trade; it being their perswasion, that to avoid a greater scandal,
this may be permitted.</p>
                     <p>They bring up their Children with extraordinary indulgence and mildness,<note place="margin">Their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> never beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and very seldom chiding them; out of this consideration, that knowing they are not
come to the use of their reason, they conceive they are not to be made capable thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time, and that things are to be instill'd into them, according to their weak capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
with mildness, and that they ought to be instructed rather by good Examples then
many Precepts. It is to be imagined that the little correction they give them in their
Childhood, strengthens that obstinate disposition, which is remarkable in all the <hi>Iapponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi>
but it is to be confessed withall, that this noble and mild kind of education much
heightens that vivacity of Understanding and Judgment, which is discernable in them,
while they are yet very young; in so much that Children of seven, eight or nine years of
age, have more piercing Wits, and are more searching and inquisitive, then our youth is at
seventeen or eighteen years of age.</p>
                     <p>They are not sent to School till they are seven or eight years of age,<note place="margin">Go not to School till seven or eight years of age.</note> upon this account,
that, as they affirm, Children are not capable of instruction before that time, and that they
are apt to learn only naughtiness and unhappy tricks one of another. The Masters, when
they meet with dull Boys, never either chide or beat them for that, but teach them to read
and write by degrees, by raising an emulation in them to do as well as others; and by this
course they improve them much better, then if they treated them harshly, it being to be
observ'd, that it is an incorrigible Nation, expecting to be mildly treated, and seldom to be
bettered by soul means and blows.</p>
                     <p>They never swath the Children,<note place="margin">Not swath'd.</note> but as soon as they are brought into the World, the
Midwife having wash'd them in cold Water, thrusts them into the Sleeves of their <hi>Iapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses,</hi>
and by that means they so harden them against heat and cold, that many times such as
scarce have the use of their legs, will crawl stark naked of all four about the House, and
into the Fields.</p>
                     <p>The eldest Son being come to Mans estate, the Father resigns his charge to him; or, if
he be a Merchant, makes over his Trade to him, with the better half of his Estate, assigns
him the best Lodgings in the House, and goes with the rest of the Family to another part
of it; or if he be a person of ability, he resigns the whole House to him, and takes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
mannaging what he hath reserved of his Estate, for the advancement of his other
Sons, if so be he hath any. The Daughters have no part of the Fathers Estate, no not
even when they are married, in regard they would not have Wives to make any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of their Dower; so that if the Brides Father should on the Wedding-day send a sum
of Money to the Bridegroom, he returns it back again with great Complements, and sends
word, that he would not have his Father-in-Law think, that his Addresses to his Daughter
proceeded from any other motive then the desire he had of his alliance, and consequently
that he expected not to make any advantage of his Estate.</p>
                     <p>They are so ambitious and highly conceited of themselves,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneses</hi> tender in point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> that it is seldom seen a <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnese</hi>
does any thing wherewith he might be reproached: but on the contrary, they
would rather lose their lives then betray their honour. Of this I shall here insert an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Example.</p>
                     <p>In the time of the War between <hi>Fidery,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it.</note> and his Guardian, the King or Prince of <hi>Coco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
who had discovered some inclination to the contrary party, was forc'd to leave his Wife
and Children as Hostages with <hi>Fidery,</hi> who hearing that the Prince of <hi>Cocora</hi> had openly
declar'd for his Adversary, sent word to his Wife, that his pleasure was, she should come
and live within the Palace. She would have excused her self, by representing to <hi>Fidery,</hi>

that she was a Wife, and as such, ow'd the Prince her Husband the same obedience, as her
Husband ow'd to the Emperour; so that if his Majesty expected she should do what he
would have her, his best course were to apply himself to her Husband, that he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
her to do it. <hi>Fidery</hi> seeing her constancy, sent her word, that if she came not, he
would have her brought thither by force. But the Princess considering with her self, that
if she left her House, it would be a dishonour both to her and her Husband, withdrew her
self with her Nurse and Children, and some of the menial Servants, who proffer'd to dye
with her, to a Chamber, into which she caused Gun-powder and Wood to be brought, and
having made her Will, and writ a Letter to her Husband, she put both into the hands of a
trustly Person, with order to depart as soon as he had seen the Powder set on fire, and by
this means gave an extraordinary Demonstration of her constancy.</p>

it of him, and spend his life for the person who hath desired him to do it; and this,
without any consideration of his Family, or the misery whereto his Wife and Children may
be thereby reduced. Hence it comes, that it is never seen a Malefactor will betray or disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his Complices; but on the contrary, there are infinite Examples of such as have chosen
rather to die with the greatest torment imaginable, then bring their Complices into any
inconvenience by their confession.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iapan</hi> is so rich and abundant in all things,<note place="margin">What For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners trade thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> that, some few Merchants excepted, who
trace into the <hi>Indies,</hi> there is hardly any <hi>Iaponnese,</hi> who meddles with the venting of
any forreign Commodities. The greatest Commerce which is carried on there is that of
the <hi>Chineses,</hi> who have continued theirs in this Country ever since the Island was first
peopled. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portuguez</hi> have traded thither these six or seven score years;
and the <hi>English</hi> had no sooner begun, but they gave over their trading into those parts,
by reason of the small advantage made thereby. Those of <hi>Siam</hi> and <hi>Cambodia</hi> were
wont to send thither yearly two or three <hi>Ionques;</hi> but this is also given over, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
since the <hi>Dutch</hi> bring them the Commodities of <hi>Iapan</hi> at a lower rate, and with less
danger then they could fetch them themselves. The chief Trade is at the City of <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi>
whither most of the Merchants, as well forreigners as those of the Country, bring all
their Commodities, and where they have their Agents and Factors, to distribute them over
all the Island.</p>
                     <p>The Commodities which Forreigners bring to <hi>Iapan</hi> are,<note place="margin">The occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Chineses</hi> and the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneses.</hi>

<hi>Picols</hi> of Silk, and abundance of Stuffs, of Silk, Cotton, Thread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> above two hundred

<hi>Borax,</hi> 'Elephants Teeth, Coral, and all kind of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which the <hi>Chineses</hi>
bring.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chineses</hi> and <hi>Iaponneses</hi> have heretofore lived in very good correspondence, in so
much that there hardly passed a year, but the Kings of those two powerful States visited
one another by reciprocal Embassies. This friendship continued till the <hi>Iaponneses,</hi> who
lived in <hi>China,</hi> became so insolent, as to ransack a whole City, and to ravish all the Women
and Maids that fell into their hands. The <hi>Chineses</hi> resented the affront as they ought, and
killed all the <hi>Iaponneses</hi> they met withall. The King of <hi>China,</hi> considering of how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequence it was to afford refuge to a sort of people, who had the insolence to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
such an action in the time of peace, banished them his Kingdom for ever, ordering the
Decree to be graven in golden Letters upon a Pillar, which to that purpose he caused to be
erected upon the Sea-side, and forbidding his Subjects, upon pain of death, to trade into
<hi>Iapan.</hi> These Prohibitions are still so strictly observ'd, that the <hi>Chineses,</hi> who go thither,
give out, that they carry their Commodities to some of the neighbouring Islands of the
<hi>Indies;</hi> in regard they are sure they would be confiscated, if it were known they carried
them to <hi>Iapan;</hi> but the <hi>Iaponneses</hi> treat the <hi>Chineses</hi> otherwise, and give them the egress
and regress of their Country.</p>
                     <p>It is haply from these Prohibitions of the King of <hi>China,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Japan</hi> was not peopled by <hi>Chine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
                        </note> that some have taken occasion
to affirm, that <hi>Iapan</hi> was peopled by certain Exiles, whom the King of <hi>China</hi> had sent
thither, upon a Conspiracy they were engaged in against his person; since the Histories of
neither <hi>Iapan</hi> nor <hi>China</hi> speak of any such thing, and that otherwise there is so great a
difference in their Cloathing, their Ceremonies, manner of Life, Language and writing, that
it is impossible that the same Nation should have contracted, even in the sequel of many
Ages, such contrary Habits. Some affirm, that the <hi>Iaponneses</hi> have made this change, in
revenge for the ill treatment they received of the others; but besides the unlikelihood
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47786:276"/>
there is, that a whole Nation should, of a sudden, conceive an aversion for what they lov'd
before, there is yet a greater improbability, that it should so change its language and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of writing, as that there should be no rapport between the one and the other. The
<hi>Chineses</hi> never cut their Hair, but tie it up together upon the Crown of the Head; the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneses,</hi>
on the contrary, shave the fore-part of the Head down to the Ears, and tie up the
rest of their Hair in their Neck behind, with a String made of Paper. The latter do also
shave their Beards, whereas the <hi>Chineses</hi> suffer theirs to grow to their full length: whence
it may be imagined, that they were rather <hi>Tartars,</hi> who first got into this Island, then
<hi>Chineses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iaponneses,</hi> being thus banished <hi>China,</hi> began to establish their Commerce at <hi>Tayou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
in the Island <hi>Fermosa,</hi> whither the <hi>Chineses</hi> came with their Commodities; but the

                        </gap>ich so troubled the Emperour, that he
would not permit his Subjects to trade out of the Kingdom without his express
Commission and Pasports; as well out of this consideration, that he would not have
any Arms transported out of the Country, as the experience he hath that the <hi>Iaponneses</hi>
are a stout and daring People out of their own Country, and being extreamly conceited of
himself, he would not have any affront done them, which it should not be in his power to
resent, or that any other then himself should chastise their insolence, as it happened to them,
not long since in the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> upon their Attempt against the Kings person
there, and at <hi>Nayouan,</hi> upon their assaulting the Governour of the place.</p>
                     <p>There is no Custom or Duty paid upon any Commodities in <hi>Iapan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">No Custom paid in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan.</hi>

or any other Prince or Lord, so that the whole advantage comes in to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant;
but in regard all drive some Trade or other, and that the Countrey is extreamly
populous, the profits are very small.</p>
                     <p>Since the Rupture between the <hi>Chineses</hi> and <hi>Iaponneses,</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Iapan</hi> hath
not held any correspondence with any forreign Prince.<note place="margin">No corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence between the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> The King of <hi>Siam,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi>
and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> sent very considerable Embassies to him, which were all very
kindly received by him; but the Emperour of <hi>Iapan</hi> never sent to visit or complement
them.</p>
                     <p>There is, all over <hi>Iapan,</hi> but one Language, which is so different from that of <hi>China,
Corea,</hi> and <hi>Tunking,</hi> that the Inhabitants of these four Countreys, understand one another
no more then we do the <hi>Arabick.</hi> There is also the same difference between their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
and yet they have all four a sort of Characters, by which they understand one the
other, so that those among them, who have studied, understand and express in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Language, what the others would have expressed in theirs, by means of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Characters. They write with Pencils, and that so fast, that they spend very little
time in writing the Notes, by which they do most of their Messages, rather then by word
of mouth. They endeavour to express themselves in few words, especially when they
either speak or write to Persons of great Quality; so that the Letters and Petitions they
address to their Superiours are couched in few words, that it is no great trouble to afford
them the reading.</p>
                     <p>They have not the way of keeping Accounts as the Merchants in our parts have;<note place="margin">Their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick.</note>
but they can count with certain little Bowls, which they thread upon little Sticks on a
square Board, as fast as our ablest Accountans by all the Rules of Arithmetick, even
that of Three.</p>
                     <p>They have many Books, and some great Libraries, but of these not so great a number as
we have in <hi>Europe.</hi>

who are in number above eight hundred, as also the Lords and Ladies descended from
him, who have the priviledge to write any Books. These only have all the Learning among
themselves, and are so proud of it, that the advantages they make thereof are equal to those
they derive from their Birth, which is no doubt more noble then that of the Emperour.
Thence it comes that they sleight all others so far, that they shun their conversation, live
in a quarter of the City distinct from the rest, and will have no communication with the
ignorant.</p>
                     <p>There is but one kind of Measure all over the Country,<note place="margin">The Money of <hi>Japan.</hi>
                        </note> and all the Money is at the same
rate and value. The Gold is in its excellency, but the Silver not so good, so that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it to the rate of that of <hi>France,</hi> there will be a loss of 22. or 23. in the 100. They
have three sorts of Gold Coins, whereof one weighs six <hi>Spanish Ryals,</hi> and is worth forty
eight <hi>Tayls,</hi> accounting every <hi>Tayl</hi> at about five Shilling <hi>Sterling.</hi> Ten of the second
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47786:277"/>
kind weigh a <hi>Ryal</hi> and half a quarter, and are worth one <hi>Tayl,</hi> and a fifth part each of them:
and ten of the third sort weigh a <hi>Ryal</hi> and a half and half a quarter, and are worth, each
of them, the sixth part of <hi>Tayl.</hi> The Silver Coin, which is made in the form of a <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,</hi>
is of no certain weight; but it is so ordered, that as much of it as amounts to fifty
<hi>Tayls</hi> is to be of a just weight, which they dispose into Rolls of Paper, in each as much as
comes to twenty Crowns, and so they dispatch their Payments with little trouble. They
have besides this a lesser Coin of Silver, made much like <hi>French</hi> Beans, which also is not of
any certain weight, save only in gross, or when it amounts to such a sum, from the value of
seven pence to six shillings, or better. There is also a great difference in the value of the
<hi>Caxias;</hi> for of some of them, a thousand are worth but Crown, whereas of others the
same number may amount to three Crowns and a half. Much about the time of our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
the Emperour had ordered them to be caried down, intending to have a new Money
made of Brass, and that the poorer sort might not be ruined thereby, he caused the bad
Money to be called in, and made good the value of it to such as brought it in.</p>
                     <p>This Country wants not any kind of Cattel,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Japan</hi> well stored with Cottel and Fowl.</note> but is so much the more abundant therein,
out of this respect, that they do not geld any Creature. Thence it comes they are well
stor'd with Houses, Bulls, Kine, Swine, Deer, wild Boars, Bears, Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as also with
all sorts of Fowl, as Swans, Geese, Ducks, Herns, Cranes, Eagles, Falcons, Pheasants,
Pidgeons, Woodcoocks, Quails, and all the other sorts of small Birds, that we have in these
parts.</p>
                     <p>There are also in this Country several sorts of Mineral Waters, very good against divers
Diseases. Some have the taste and qualities of Copper, others that of Saltpeter, Iron,
Tin, Salt; and there is, among others, a Source of hot water which hath the taste of Tin,
and issues out of a Caye, which is about ten foot diameter at the mouth, and hath both
above and below several picked Stones, like Elephants teeth, so that it somewhat resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
that figure, by which some would represent the Jaws of Hell. The Water, which
comes out of it in great bubbles day and night constantly, is not so hot, but that it may be
endured as soon as it is out of the Source, so that there is no need of mixing any other
water therewith.</p>
                     <p>There is in this Country, in a spacious Plain, at the foot of a Mountain, not far from the
Sea-side, another Source, which gives Water but twice in four and twenty hours, and that
during the space of an hour at each time, unless it be when the East-wind blows, for then
it gives water four times a day. This water comes out of a hole, which Nature hath
made in the ground, and which they have cover'd with several great Stones; but when
the time of its floud, as I may call it, is come, the water is forced out with such violence
amidst the Stones, that it shakes them all, and makes a cast twenty or twenty four foot high,
with such noise as would drown that of a great Gun. It is so hot, that it is impossible fire
should raise ordinary water to so high a degree of heat, as the earth gives this; for it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
burns the stuffes on which it falls, and keeps its heat much longer, then the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that hath been boil'd over the fire. The Well is inclosed with a high Wall, having at
the bottom thereof several holes, through which the water runs into certain Channels, and
so is brought into the houses, where they bath themselves, reducing it to such a degree of
warmth as may be endured.</p>
                     <p>Some affirm that their Physicians are so able,<note place="margin">Their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians.</note> that there is no Disease which they cannot
discover by the Pulse. They are perfectly well skill'd in the vertues of Simples and Drugs,
especially those of the <hi>Radix Chinat,</hi> and <hi>Rhubarbe,</hi> whereof they make use in their <hi>Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe's,</hi>
which for the most part consist in Pills, with very good success. They are also very
fortunate in the curing of ordinary Diseases; but Chirurgery is not as yet known among
them.</p>
                     <p>The Mineral Waters we spoke of before,<note place="margin">The riches of <hi>Japan.</hi>
                        </note> are a sufficient demonstration, that there are in
<hi>Iapan</hi> Mines of all sorts of Metals. Accordingly, there is found Gold, Silver, Copper,
Tin, Iron and Lead. The Country brings forth also Cotton, Flax and Hemp, wherewith
they make very fine Cloaths. It produces also Silk, and affords abundance of Goat and
Deer skins, the richest Works of Wood and <hi>Lacque</hi> of any in the World, all sorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and medicinal Drugs. They have, among others, a particular Invention for the
melting of Iron,<note place="margin">A particular way of melti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There could not be hitherto had any true account of the Emperour of <hi>Iapan</hi>'s Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue:
but it is certain that he makes above two Millions of Gold of the Rice, which his
own Demesne affords him every year. It is also certain, that the Emperour of <hi>Iapan</hi> is so
powerful,
that <hi>Taicko,</hi> whom we spoke of before, finding himself well settled upon the
Throne, had a design to pass over into <hi>China,</hi> with a Fleet of two thousand Vessels, for the
building whereof he had already cut down Timber, which he might have done with the
more ease, upon this account, that the <hi>Iaponneses</hi> are incomparably a more warlike Nation
then the <hi>Chineses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in regard there is not any thing makes a greater descovery of the greatness of this
Monarch,
then the Ceremonies of the Interview between him and the <hi>Dayro,</hi> whereof we
promised before to give here a short description, we think fit to that purpose to insert in
this place the Extract of a Relation made by the Director of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commerce in
<hi>Iapan,</hi> who was at <hi>Meaco</hi> in the year 1626. This Author sayes, that being at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
Court in the moneth of <hi>October,</hi> in the year aforesaid, with some others of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
of his Nation, he was desirous to see the Procession, which was made there on the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47786:278"/>
25. of the said moneth. To that end they went the 24. and with the retinue took up a
house, which they had hired near the <hi>Dayro</hi>'s Palace, in regard the next day it would have
been impossible for them to pass the Streets.</p>
                     <p>On the said 25. of <hi>October,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the <hi>Dayro</hi> and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> as soon as it was light, they found the Streets and tops of
Houses full of people. The Streets were rail'd in on both sides, from the <hi>Dayro</hi>'s Palace
to the Emperours, having files of Souldiers all along, and the middle of the Street strew'd
with white Sand, all laid so even, that nothing should retard the Procession, or disturb its
Order. These Souldiers, who were part of the <hi>Dayro</hi>'s Guards, part of the Emperours,
were all clad in white, having on their Heads Casks of black <hi>Lacque,</hi> by their sides two
Cymitars, and in their Hands a <hi>Nauganet,</hi> that is, a <hi>Iaponnese</hi> Pike.</p>
                     <p>The first appearance was that of a great number of the Domesticks of these two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">The <hi>Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's</hi> bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.</note>
going to and fro, as also that of several Porters or Sedan-men, who carried in great
square Chests, which were of black <hi>Lacque</hi> and gilt, the baggage of the <hi>Dayro</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
Palace.</p>
                     <p>Then followed,<note place="margin">The Ladies of Honour.</note> in forty six <hi>Palanquins,</hi> carried each of them by four men, so many Maids
of Honour belonging to the <hi>Dayro</hi>'s Wives, who went in that equipage to the Emperours
Palace. The <hi>Palanquins</hi> were of a fine white Wood, painted with Verdure, garnished
with brass Plates, very neatly made, and five or six foot high.</p>
                     <p>After them there came one and twenty other <hi>Palanquines</hi> of a kind, which they call
<hi>Norrimones,</hi> varnish'd with black and gilt.</p>
                     <p>Next them there came twenty seven other <hi>Norrimones,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">27. Lords of the <hi>Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's</hi> Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</note> of the same bigness with the

who were carried in them to the Emperours Palace, having every one before him a gilt
Umbrello, covered with very fine Cloth. They had about them a hundred and eight Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
clad in white,<note place="margin">24. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> and behind them four and twenty Gentlemen, armed as if they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to engage in a fight. These had on their Heads a kind of Bonnets of black <hi>Lacque,</hi>
with a little Plume of Feathers of the same colour, and under their <hi>Iaponnesses</hi> they had
long and narrow Breeches of Satin, of several colours, embroidered with Gold and Silver,
with Buskins varnished with black, and gilt at the extremities. By their Sides they had
Cimitars, the Hilts whereof were gilt, and Bows and Arrows at their Waste, and over their
Shoulders Scarfs richly embroidered, the ends whereof hung down on the Cruppers of
their Horses. No doubt, they had cull'd out the goodliest persons in the Country of this
Ceremony; for they were all the handsomest persons, both as to Body and Countenance,
that could be seen. Their Saddles were varnish'd over and gilt, the Seats embroidered
and covered with Tigers and Lynxes Skins; their Trappings were of Crimson Silk twined,
and the Horses had their Mains tied up with Gold and Silver Thread, and they had on the
Breast and Crupper a kind of Net-work of twined crimson Silk, and instead of Shooes
their Hoofs were done about with plain crimson Silk. Every Horse was led by two Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies,
and two other Lacquies carried two great Umbrelloes, covered with a very fine and
transparent cloth, and upon that a covering of Scarlet fring'd with Gold. Another Lacquie
carried a <hi>Nanganet,</hi> or Pike, the top whereof was also covered with a piece of red and
black cloth. Every Horsman had eight Pages clad in white, and arm'd with two Cymitars,
according to the mode of the Country.</p>
                     <p>This body of Horse serv'd for a Guard for the three chiefest of the <hi>Dayro</hi>'s Wives,<note place="margin">The <hi>Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s three Wives.</note> who
followed it in three Coaches of so extraordinary a making, that we shall not think it much
to afford them a short description. They were at least twenty or twenty five foot in height,
ten or twelve in length, and five or six in breadth, having on each side three, and before,
two Windows with embroydered Curtains. Before and behind they were made like the
Front of a House, as was also the Door at which they went in, which was made behind at
the back. The Wheels were of Iron, and the Coach was varnished all over with black,
so that the Wheels might be seen turning as it were in a Looking-glass. The Roofs of
them, which were built Arch-wise, had drawn thereon the <hi>Dayro</hi>'s Arms, within a great
Circle of Gold. The Pillars, as also the inside of the Coach, was inriched with Figures of
beaten Gold and Mother of Pearl, and all the extremities were garnished with Gold. Two
great black Bufflers, covered with a Net-work of Crimson Silk, drew each of them, and
they were guided by four Halberteers clad in white. Every Coach was valued at seventy
thousand <hi>Tayls,</hi> which amount to twenty thousand pounds <hi>Sterling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Coaches had also their Foot-guard, and many Pages marching on both sides of
them.</p>
                     <p>Twenty three of the chiefest Servants belonging to these Ladies were carried next to

thirteen varnished with black and gilt, and the other eighteen were only varnished
with black. There were carried after them fourty six Umbrelloes suitable to their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonnes.</p>
                     <p>Then followed the <hi>Dayro</hi>'s Musick,<note place="margin">His Musick.</note> which consisted of fifty four Gentlemen, very odly,

as being about seven or eight foot high, and as many Diameter, having windows on all
sides, with embroidered Curtains. The Roof of that little Structure was arch'd, and
had in the midst, upon a great Button, a Cock of massie Gold, with his Wings spread in a
Field Azure, with several Stars of beaten Gold about the Sun and Moon, which appeared
there with a lustre coming near the natural. This <hi>Machine</hi> was carried by fifty Gentlemen
of the <hi>Dayro's</hi> retinue, all clad in white, with Bonnets on their Heads. Fourty other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
went before it, and represented the Guard for the <hi>Dayro's</hi> person. These were clad
after a particular fashion, much like that of the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> carrying each of them a

him fourty Umbrelloes for the Guards.</p>
                     <p>Next were carried thirteen varnish'd Chests, and in the close of the Procession came
four hundred Souldiers clad in white, who marched six a breast, and by that means hinder
the crowds of people to interrupt that Order. This Ceremony took up the whole day,
so that night coming on upon us at the place where we were, we thought it not safe to
venture home at so unseasonable a time, by reason of the many Robberies, Murthers, and
other Violences committed in the Streets during the disorder, which proved so great, that
the next morning there were found a great number of dead persons, some whereof had
been kill'd and robb'd, and others had been smother'd in the throng. The <hi>Dayro</hi> staid
three dayes at the Emperours Palace, who during that time waited on him in person with

upon the Channel, where they have a little Garrison of twenty five or thirty men, which
are enough to defend the entrance of it; and they have found the scituation of it so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious,

Superiours over them, then such as they create among themselves, after the manner we
shall give an account of hereafter. Its Rivers are excellently well stor'd with Fish; Its
Forrests well furnished with all sorts of wild-Fowls and Venison; and its Fields, which
are for the most part Meddows, in a manner covered with Cattel. They have Deere,
Wild-Goates, Hares, Conies, Pheasants, Partridges, Pidgeons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and besides these a kind
of horned Horse, by the Inhabitants called <hi>Olavang,</hi> whose horns are like those of Deere,
and the flesh very delicate. They have also Tygers, and another kind of Animal, which
they call <hi>Tirney,</hi> made like a Bear, but much stronger. The skin of this Beast, they account
one of the most precious things that the Island produces.</p>
                     <p>The ground here is fat and fruitful, but so poorly cultivated, that there are very few
Fruit-trees, and the little Fruit that is, so bad, that though the Islanders eat it in some
delight, yet cannot other Nations so much as taste of it. There grows some Ginger and
Cinnamon in this Island, which they say hath Gold and Silver Mines, whereof the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi>

of a brown complexion, inclining to black, as most of the <hi>Indians</hi> are. The women are
somewhat less, but fat enough, and, for the most part, well shaped. They make a greater
discovery of shamefacedness then the men, in that they have somewhat of cloathing about
them: but both men and women strip themselves, when they bath, which they do twice
a day, in warm water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for then, the latter are not ashamed to be seen by men, nor care

This People, which in appearance seems to be so barbarous, is in effect, good natur'd,
faithful and obliging,<note place="margin">Are civil and good natured.</note> entertaining strangers with much kindness and civillity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
to them such good chear as nature affords them. It hath never been found
that they were desirous to get what belongs to any other by indirect ways, but on the
contrary, they have often returned to the owners what they found mis-laid or lost; though
the Inhabitants of the Village of <hi>Toulang</hi> have a very ill report, as to this particular.
They are constant and faithful in their friendship, and religiously observe, as well the
Treatises they make among themselves, as those made with Forreigners. Treachery is a
thing they are so unacquainted withal,<note place="margin">Are ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> that there is no misfortune which they would
not suffer rather then any reproach should be made them of unfaithfulness. They want
neither ingenuity nor memory, but easily apprehend and retain what is said unto them.
'Tis true, they have an humour of impudently begging any thing they see; but they are
denied with the same freedom, and are satisfied with a small matter.</p>
                     <p>They live altogether by the little Husbandry they carry on, and the Rice they get out
of the ground. Not but that their Lands are very fruitful, and that the <hi>Cantons</hi> we
named before might produce, what were able to sustain above ten thousand Families:
but in regard they have no Ploughs, nor Creatures fit for Tillage, they have no other way
of digging the ground, then that of the Spade, and that by the hands of Women; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as the men mind only War and Hunting, and so their increase cannot be so great
as that of those places where they have better conveniences. Another employment of the
women is, to transplant the Rice, when it grows thicker in one place then another; which
work takes up much of their time, as does also their cutting of it when it is ripe. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of reaping it by handfulls with a Hook, they cut it Corn by Corn, some four or five
fingers below the Ear, so put it up in the house, and never beat it but when there is
occasion, in order to their subsistance, that is, every day. The woman of the house sets
over-night two or three little bundles of it a-drying in the Chimney-corner, and rising the
next morning two hours before day, she beats it in a Morter, and makes as much clean Rice
as is requisite for the Family that day, and no more. And thus they live all the year
long.</p>

They have Ginger, Cinamon, Sugar-canes, <hi>Bannanan's,</hi> Lemmons, abundance of <hi>Areea,</hi>
and several other sorts of Fruits, Simples, and Pulse, not known in <hi>Europe,</hi> such as it
would be no easie matter to describe.</p>
                     <p>Though they have no <hi>Cocos</hi>-wine,<note place="margin">Their Wine.</note> nor any other natural drink, yet have they found out
a way to make a kind of Beverage, which is as strong, and intoxicates a mans brains assoon
as the best Sack. Their way of ordering it is thus. They set a soaking in warm water
a certain quantity of Rice, which they afterwards beat in a Morter till it be reduced to a
Paste. Then they chew some Rice-meal in their mouths, which they spet into a Pot, till
such time as they have got a Quart of Liquor, which they put to the Pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e instead of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and after they have kneaded all well together, till they have brought it to Dough,
such as that of the Bakers, they put it into a great Earthen Pot, which they fill up with
water, and so let it remain there for two months; and by this means they make one of
the best and most pleasant Liquors that a man need drink. This is their Wine, which is
stronger or weaker according to the time it remains in the Pot; and the older it is, the
better and sweeter it is; insomuch that sometimes they keep it five and twenty or thirty
years. VVhat is towards the mouth of the Pot is as clear as Rock-water, but at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there are only dregs, such as were able to turn a weak stomack; and yet the Islanders
make it one of their delicacies, and eat it with Spoons, having first stirr'd at about, with
a little water put to it. When they go into the Countrey, they carry along with them a
Pot of this stuff, and a Gourd-bottle full of water, and so they are furnish'd as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

particularly to get Oysters, which the Islanders prefer before all meat whatsoever.
They have a way of salting the Fish slightly assoon as it is taken, with the shell, and
whatsoever is within it, and they eat them with all the filth, nay with the worms, which
sometimes are bred within them for want of Salt.</p>

Bows and Arrows. They spread their Snares or Nets in the Woods, cross those Paths,
which the Deers and wild Boars are wont to make, and force those Creatures into them:
or haply, they spread them in the open fields, with the convenience of a great Cane, one
end whereof they plant in the ground, and the other is bowed down, and fastened to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
little sticks, upon which they lay a Suare cover'd with a little earth, which assoon as
the wild Beast touches, the Carie is suddenly as it were unbent, and hath him by one of
the feet. The Hunting with that kind of Pikes is thus. There met together, at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
place appointed, the Inhabitants of two or three Villages, arm'd every one with two
or three Pikes, and having divided themselves into several parties, they send their Dogs
into the Woods, and they force out the Game into the Fields, where they meet, and make
a great Ring, a League or more in compass, within which when they have once gotten the
Deer and wild Boars, it seldom happens that any of them escape without being kill'd or
hurt. The Pike it self is of Cane, six or seven foot in length, having an Iron at the top
with several Hooks, so as that being entred into the beast, it is beyond any mans strength
to get it out: but the Iron is not made so fast to the Wood but that it comes off at the
first bush the beast runs into; and to the end it may still annoy the Deer, there is a Cord
fastened thereto, which holds both, and at the top of the Iron there is a little Bell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Beast is discover'd where-ever it goes. They destroy so great a number of Deer
by these kinds of Hunting, that being not able to spend all they take themselves, they
sell the flesh of them to the <hi>Chineses,</hi> for little Garments, Sweet Wood, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
eating themselves only the Umbles and Paunch, which they salt with the filth
in them, and indeed care not much for them, till when they are thus corrupted. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
while they are hunting, they cut off a piece, and eat it immediately, so as that the
bloud runs about their mouths; and if they find any young ones in the belly of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
whether come into any form or not, they eat them with the skin and hair, as a
thing very delicate.</p>

                        </note> They begin not any War till they have
first declared it against the Village by which they conceive themselves injured, and then
they go by small parties of five and twenty or thirty men, and hide themselves near the
place they are to assault, till it be night, and then they run about the Fields, and if they
find any in the Huts, where aged persons are wont to keep, as we said before they kill
them, cut off their heads, and, if they have time enough, the hands and feet, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they cut the whole body to pieces, that every one may carry away his share, and
shew the marks of his courage at his return. If the Country take the Alarm, so as they
cannot quite cut off the Head, they think it enough to cut off the hair, which they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away as a noble Demonstration of their Victory; which is accounted among them a
very considerable one, though that in an exploit of this nature there happens to be but
one man kill'd. Sometimes they venture so far as to enter into the Village, and break
open some house; but in regard that cannot be done without noise, they go upon such a
Design with so much precipitation, that lest they should be intercepted in their return,
they kill all they meet, and fly for it. They also use stratagems, and make Ambushes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their way, and sometimes they engage in the open field, where they fight with
great animosity: but the death of one man passes among them for an absolute Defeat, and
obliges those who have had that loss, to an immediate Retreat.</p>

body, and their Swords on the contrary, are short, but broad. They use also Knives
made like those of the <hi>Iaponneses,</hi> Bows and Arrows.</p>
                     <p>When several Villages make an Association among themselves to carry on a War jointly
against some other Villages, the Command of their Forces is not bestow'd on one Chief, who
hath Authority sufficient to force himself to be obey'd: but such among them as have been
so fortunate as to cut off divers heads upon several occasions, find Volunteers enough to
follow them in their military Exploits, out of no other Consideration, then that of partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
of the Glory of their Commander. Sometimes they engage in a War out of
a pure frolick, against the Inhabitants of the Island of <hi>Tugin,</hi> which the <hi>Dutch</hi> call
the Island of the <hi>Golden Lyon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Island of <hi>Tugin.</hi>
                        </note> upon this account, that the Captain and Master of
a Ship, of that name, were there killed by the Islanders. The Inhabitants of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47786:281"/>
this place permit not any strangers to come within their Island; nay they suffer not the
<hi>Chineses,</hi> who come thither every year upon the account of their Commerce, to set foot on
Land; but they force them to stay in the Road, whither the Islanders bring the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
they would truck with them; with so much distrust on their side, that they never
let go any thing out of one hand, till they have fast hold of what they would have in the
other. The Inhabitants of <hi>Fermosa,</hi> especially those of the Village of <hi>Soulang,</hi> having a
Design to surprize them, embarqu'd themselves not long since, to the number of sixty, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiz'd
like <hi>China</hi> Merchants, and being come near the Island of <hi>Tugin,</hi> sent to some of the
Islanders to come and meet them with the Commodities of the Countrey: but instead of
receiving them from his hands, who presented them therewith, they laid hold of his arm,
and drew him aboard their Vessel, where they cut him to pieces. This was a great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to them; for they think it enough to bring away the Hair, or haply a Pike of the Enemies,
to make a solemn Triumph, and appoint a day of publick Thanksgiving. They carry the
Heads in Procession all about the Village, singing Hymns to their Gods, and, in their way,
visit their Friends, who make them drink of the best <hi>Arac,</hi> and accompany them to the
<hi>Pagode,</hi> where they boil the Head, till there be nothing left but the Bones, on which they
sprinkle some Wine, Sacrifice several Swine to their Gods, and feast it for fifteen days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
They do the like when they have brought home only the Hair, or a Pike, which,
as also the Bones of their Enemies, they keep a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fully as we do Gold, Silver, or Jewels,
inasmuch as when a House is a-fire, they abandon all, to save their Relicks. They tender
so great respect to those who have had the good fortune to bring home an Enemies Head,
that no person comes near him, but with a certain veneration, for above fifteen days after
his doing such an exploit, nor speak to him but with such extraordinay submissions, as
that a Soveraign Prince could not expect greater.</p>
                     <p>There is no Lord in all that Island,<note place="margin">Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy.</note> that hath a Superiority or advantage over the rest.
Their condition is equal, save that in every Village there is a kind of Senate, consisting of
twelve persons, which are changed every two years. The two years being expir'd, they
who are to quit their places pull of their Hair off their Eye brows, and on both sides of
their Heads, to shew that they have been Magistrates. The Senators are chosen out of
persons much about the same age, which is that of forty years: for though they have no
Almanack, and cannot count their years, yet do they remember well enough the course of
the Moon, and take particular notice of such as are born within the same Month, and
about the same Year.</p>
                     <p>Not that this Magistrate hath any Authority to force himself to be obey'd,<note place="margin">Its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> or to put his
Commands in execution; for all the power they have, is only to give order for an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to be held, concerning such Affairs as they think of importance, to confer among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thereof, and to invite all the Heads of Families, to meet in one of their <hi>Pagodes,</hi>
where they propose to them how things stand, discover what they think fit to be done,
and endeavour to bring the rest to be of the same judgment with them. All the Senatours
speak one after another, and use all the Eloquence they have to press their Reasons the
more home: I say, <hi>Eloquence,</hi> for they really have of it. For they will speak half an
hour together in such high expressions, with so much ease, and with such apt gestures, that
what we are taught by Art comes not near what Nature hath bestow'd on these People, who
can neither write nor read. While one speaks, all the rest are so exactly silent, that you shall
not hear so much as a Cough, though their Assemblies many times consist of a thousand
persons. When all the Senators have done speaking, the rest put the business to deliberation,
with an absolute freedom of either complying with the judgment of the Senate, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it, after they have considered the good or evil which may accrew to them thereby.</p>
                     <p>All the power they have consists in causing what their Priestesses command to be put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,<note place="margin">Their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</note>
in preventing ought to be done which may offend the Gods, and in punishing such as
do offend them. They also give reparations to private persons who have been injur'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
not by causing the offenders to be imprison'd or punish'd with death, or other corporal
punishment; but in condemning them to pay a piece of cloth, a Deerskin, a certain quantity of
Rice, or a pot of their <hi>Aracque,</hi> by way of satisfaction, according to the quality of the crime.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain season of the year, wherein they go stark naked, and say they do it out of
this consideration, that were it not for that, the Gods would not cause it to rain, and the
Rice would not grow: insomuch, that if during the said time, the Senators meet with
any one that hath ought about his waste, the cloth or whatsoever it be, is confiscated, and
he is adjudged to a penalty, which at most, is but two Deer-skins, or a certain quantity of
Rice amounting to the same value. Whence it comes, that it is one of the principal Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Senatours, to be during that time, morning and evening, about the
avenues of the Village, and to punish such as they find Delinquent. There
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47786:281"/>
are other seasons wherein they are permitted to cover that part of the body, (which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
uncovered in other places,) but with this restriction; that the garment, or rather
skarf, wherewith it is covered, must not be of Silk; whence it also comes, that the same Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours
are to take particular notice of it, confiscate those Silk Garments, and adjudge
the offendours to pay a penalty; as they do also the women, who to make the greatest
ostentation, upon days of publick Ceremonies, go otherwise then they are permitted to do.</p>

injured do themselves Justice. When the theft is discovered, he who hath been robb'd,
goes accompanied by his Friends, to find out the person who hath robb'd him, and takes
out of his house what he thinks sufficient to make him satisfaction, by an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he makes with the other; but if he finds any Opposition, he declares open hostility
against him, till such time as he hath made him satisfaction. He who finds himself inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his reputation, by Adultery committed with his Wife, revenges himself another way;
for he takes out of his house who hath had to do with his wife, two or three Piggs, as a
satisfaction for the injury he hath received. The Friends and Relations on both sides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

                     <p>There is among them so great an equality of condition, that they are yet ignorant of the
names of <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Servant.</hi> Yet does not this hinder, but that they render great honour
one to another,<note place="margin">They have a respect for old Age.</note> and express a great respect and submission one towards another: not out
of any consideration of a more eminent dignity, or upon the accompt of wealth, but only
upon that of Age; which is so considered among them, that a young man is obliged to go
aside, to make way for an old man, and turn his back to him, by way of respect, till he
be passed, by continuing in that posture, even though the old man should stand still to speak
to him. No young man dares deny the doing of what the other commands him, though
he should send him three or four Leagues upon some business of his. They are the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

they are forbidden to wear long hair, so that they cut it even with the tip of the Ear;
and in regard they have neither Cisers nor Rasors, to do that work, they make use of a
<hi>Parring,</hi> which is a kind of little chopping-knife, lay down the hair upon a piece of wood,
and cut it as exactly as the most expert Barbers among us. They draw forth the hair of
their faces with little Pincers of Brass or Iron, or with the string of a great Cane which
they double, and getting the hair fast between it, they turn the string till the hair be
taken out. Being come to the seventeenth year of their age, they let their hair grow,
and when it is come to its ordinary length, they begin to think of marriage. Maids ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cut their hair, and they are married assoon as they are marriageable.</p>

concluded, insomuch that the young man may consummate it the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The wealth which the most able among them send to their Brides, consists in seven
or eight of these skarfs of Silk or Cotton, wherewith the women cover themselves about
the waste, so many little wastcoats of the same stuffe, three or four hundred bracelets of
Canes, ten or twelve Rings of Latten, or Deers horn, which are so broad that they hide
half the Fingers, and so thick, that when the Ladies have them on, they are rather a trouble,
then any ornament to them; four or five Girdles of course Cloth, ten or twelve little Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which they call <hi>Ethgrao,</hi> and are made of Dogs-hair, twenty or twenty five <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas</hi>
or <hi>China</hi> garments, a bag of Dogs-hair as big as a man can well carry, which they call
in their Language <hi>Ayammamiang,</hi> a kind of head-gear, made like a Mitre, of straw and
Dogs-hair; and lastly, in four or five pair of stockins of Deer-skin; so that all put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may amount to about forty Crowns at most. Others who are not so rich, give only three
or four Bracelets, and certain Garments, all not amounting to above two or three Crowns.</p>
                     <p>The marriage being thus concluded,<note place="margin">A pleasant married life.</note> the young Gallant goes in the Evening to his Bride
at her Fathers house, and endeavours to get in by stealth, shunning both fire and light,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47786:282"/>
lest he should be seen, and so creeps into the bed, where the marriage is to be consummated.
This he does for many years after his marriage, coming thence before day, and returning
at night to his Wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who still continues at her Fathers house, concealing himself so from
those of the houshold, that to call to his Wife for Tobacco or ought else he stands in need
of, he only hems, and permits her to return to the company she was in before, as soon as
she hath done what he desired. Of this carriage the reason is, that it were a shame for her
to leave her Relations, to go to her Husband. Their bed-steads are made of <hi>Bambus</hi> or
Canes; a baven serves them for a bolster, and a Dear-skin for bed and all belonging three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                     <p>The women living thus with their Fathers, till the ground belonging to the Family,
while the Husband lives at his own house, and provides only for himself. They never see
one another in the day time, unless they appoint it to be in some remote place, where
they may not be seen speaking together; or unless the young man goes to the house, when
he knows there is none but his Wife at home; yet will he not enter, till he hath sent one
to know, whether it may be done without any inconvenience to her. If she think fit he
should see her, she comes to the door, and makes him a sign to enter; but if she desires
not his company, she sends him away. The children they have remain with the Mother
till they are thirteen years of age,<note place="margin">The Women bear no children till 35. years of Age.</note> and then the Father takes them home. The Women
bear no children till they are thirty-five or thirty six years of Age, but destroy in the
womb such as they conceive before that time. To procure abortion, they have one of their
Priestesses comes to them, who kneeling upon their bellies causes miscarriage, insomuch
that the Fruit of the Womb, is forc'd out before they leave kneeding of them in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
with greater pain to the Woman, then if she were naturally delivered. Not that
they are wanting in point of kindness to their Children, but prepossessed and befotted with
the lewd impression they receive from their Priestesses, that it were a great sin and shame
for them to bear Children before that Age.</p>
                     <p>The men live not with their Wives till they are forty years of Age. Then they take
their leave of the <hi>Pagodes</hi> of their quarter, forsake their own houses, and go and live in
the VVives; but being come to that Age, they spend most of their time in the Fields,
retireing in the night time into Huts, that they may be near their work.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding this liberty,<note place="margin">Divorce lawful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</note> which the men have to see their wives when they please
themselves, and to divert themselves elsewhere all day long, yet would they have also the
conveniency of Divorce. Assoon as a man is weary of his wife, he leaves her, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
another; but with this difference, that if he puts her away without cause, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
he sent her shall remain hers; but if she be convicted of Adultery, or chance to be
so transported with passion, as to revile her husband in words, or affront him otherwise,
she is bound to make restitution. Divorce is reciprocally free to both parties, so that
Wedlock no more obliges the woman then it does the men; and it often happens that
both of them change their conditions. They condemn Polygamy, though some of them
marry two or three wives. But in regard there is neither Law nor Magistrate to punish any
Crime wherein there is no Civil concernment, this remains unpunished, as well as Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
for, provided they conceal it from their own Wives, and her Husband whom they
abuse, they may confidently, and without any scandal seek their fortunes elsewhere. A
man never finds any incestuous marriages among them, nor that a man takes a wife with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the fourth degree of Consanguity or Affinity. Nor do they care a man should aske af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Wives, as how they do, whether they be handsome or not, of what friends they
come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Boyes, from four years of Age and upwards, nay married men, when they do not lodge
with their Wives, lye not at their own houses, but in a <hi>Pagode</hi> or <hi>Mosquite,</hi> where the
Males of fourteen or fifteen Families meet in the Evening, and lye there, upon little Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
or Bedsteds of Canes, made as we described before.</p>
                     <p>Their houses are spacious,<note place="margin">Their houses</note> and fairer then such as are ordinarily seen in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
They are all raised five or six foot from the Ground, and have four doors, one towards
every quarter of the Heavens. There are some have two of a side, and are three or
four stories high. They have no other ornament then what they derive from the heads
of Deer and wild-Boars, wherein they are covered both within and without. You find
in them only certain stuffs, wherewith they cover themselves, and Deer-skins, which in
their trade with the <hi>Chineses,</hi> is to them instead of mony. All the houshold-stuff they have
in their houses are only Spades to digg the ground withall, Pikes, Bows, Arrows, and some
other Arms. But what they account most precious, are the heads or other Trophies ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from their Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Instead of dishes, they use little troughs of wood, such as among
us are set before Swine. Their drinking-pots are of Earth or Cane, and they also boil
their Rice in Earthen-pots.</p>

                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:47786:282"/>
Rice is their ordinary sustenance; and if they put thereto either fish, or flesh, they eat not
of it, till it be corrupted and full of worms.<note place="margin">Their suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> Their drink is not ill, especially to such as
have not over-weak stomacks, or know not how it is made; but on the contrary it is

                     <p>They have no set day for either rest or devotion,<note place="margin">Have no Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals.</note> and celebrate no Festivals, yet do they
meet on certain days to be merry, and make good chear; every quarter meeting, to that
purpose, in its own <hi>Pagode,</hi> whither the women also come, dress'd in the richest things
they have, and clad after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such a manner as we cannot well describe, our Language not
having terms to express the odness of their habit. Their richest cloathing is made of
Dogs-hair.<note place="margin">Dogshair-stuffs.</note> For as we shear Sheep to make woollen stuffs of; so they have Dogs, whose
hair they cut once a year, and dying it red, make stuffs thereof, which they esteem, as we
hear do Velvet, or the best Scarlet.</p>
                     <p>The Ceremonies performed here upon the death of any one are haply as remarkable as
any the Reader shall find in this relation.<note place="margin">Their Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</note> Immediately after the departure of any one,
they beat a Drum before his door to acquaint the Village therewith. This Drum is
made of the Trunk of a great tree, so that it may be heard at a great distance, and upon
that noise all the people come to the door of the deceased. The women bring each of
them a pot of their <hi>Arac,</hi> and having sufficiently drunk to the memory of the Deceased,
they fall a dancing upon a great empty round Chest, so that their motion, which is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
violent, makes a dull and doleful noise, suitable to the sorrow they would express.
There get upon the Chest, eight or ten women at a time, in two ranks, who turn their
backs one to another, and gently stirring their armes and feet, they go several times about
the Chest, till such time as being weary, they think fit to make way for others; and
this exercise lasts about two hours.<note place="margin">They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bury nor burn the dead.</note> The next day, or two days after, they begin to think
of the body, not in order to <hi>burial,</hi> as we do, nor yet to <hi>burn</hi> it, as some of the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Nations are wont to do; but to dry it. To do that, they make in some part of the
house, a Scaffold of Canes, raised five or six foot from the ground, whereto they fasten the
body, by the hands and feet, and they make a great fire about it to dry it, killing in the
mean time a great many Swine, and feasting it for nine days together. During which
time they wash the body every day, yet does not that hinder, but that it infects the
whole house, nay indeed the Neighbourhood. After nine days, it is taken thence, to be
wrapt up in a Mat, being in which, they place it on another Scaffold, higher then the
former, and compassed with several garments like a Pavilion, and then they reiterate their
dancing and feasting. The body remains in the posture till the third year, and then they
take the bones out of it, and bury them in some part of the house, with the same Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of feasting and dancing.</p>
                     <p>At the Village of <hi>Theosang,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A mad ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diseases.</note> they have a custom, which would hardly be observ'd else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
They fasten a Rope about their necks who suffer much pain in their sickness, raise
them up by force to a great height, and let them fall down with as much violence, as if
they intended to give them the strapado: by which means they are indeed put out of all
further pain.</p>
                     <p>As to Religion,<note place="margin">Their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> it may be said they have not any at all. Of all the Inhabitants, not
one can write or read, and yet they have certain Traditions, upon which they have framed
a certain shadow of Religion. For they believe the World hath been from all Eternity,
and shall last Eternally. They believe the immortality of the Soul, and thence it comes,
that when any one dies, they build before his door a little Hut of bows of trees, set
Banners at the four corners, and within the Hut a wooden Vessel full of water, with a
Cane-spoon, out of a perswasion, that the souls of the deceased return every day to the
Hut, to purifie themselves. 'Tis true, most of them do it purely out of compliance with
custome, and know not the reason thereof: but aged persons are not ignorant of it. They
believe also, that Souls shall find good or evil in the other life, according to what they
have done in this, and affirm, that to go out of this World into the other, they pass over a
very narrow Bridge of Canes, under which runs a Channel full of all kind of filth and
nastiness, into which the wicked being fallen do there languish eternally; but that the good
Souls pass into a pleasant and delightful Countrey, of which they speak, much after the
same rate the Poets speak of the <hi>Elysian</hi> fields. But there are very few comprehend these
mysteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or think of any other life then the present.</p>
                     <p>Their sins are much different from ours.<note place="margin">Their Sins.</note> Murther, Theft, Adultery, and other Crimes,
are not so much as slight offences among them, and they make so little account of simple
Fornication, that they only laugh at it, reprove it not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

marrying before Twenty, or twenty one years of age, yet it is lawful for them
to cajol and debauch a neighbours Wife, so he know nothing of it. But it is a great Sin
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47786:283"/>
among them, to have cover'd the privy parts at a certain season of the year; to wear seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Garments, or one only of Silk, at a time when they should have worn them of Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;
not to have destroyed Children in the Mothers womb; and to have born any before
thirty five or thirty six years of Age. These are the sins, which in their judgment deserve
eternal pains; all the rest is only foolery.</p>
                     <p>They adore several pretended Divinities,<note place="margin">Their Gods.</note> but among others two, one whereof is called
<hi>Tamagisanhach,</hi> and the other <hi>Sariahsingh.</hi> The former hath his abode in the South, and
contributes to the generation of man, who receives from this God, only what is excellent
and acceptable, either in his body or mind. They affirm, that his Wife, whom they call
<hi>Taxankpanda,</hi> lives in the East, whence she is heard, when it thunders towards that quarter,
speaking to her Husband, <hi>Tamasgisanhach,</hi> and chiding him, for suffering the Earth to be
too long without Rain, and that thereupon her Husband causes it immediately to Rain.
The other God hath his retreat in the North, and destroys all the excellency which <hi>Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisanhach</hi>
hath bestowed on man, by disfiguring his face with the Small Pox, and sending
him several other Inconveniencies. Whence it comes they invoke them both, one, that
they may not be injured by him, and the other that he may prevent <hi>Sariasingh</hi> from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them any mischief. Besides these, they have two other Gods, who have the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of War, named <hi>Talafula,</hi> and <hi>Tapaliape;</hi> but they are invocated only by men.</p>
                     <p>There is not any Nation,<note place="margin">Women only employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Mysteries.</note> that falls within my knowledge at least, but makes use of
<hi>Men</hi> in the Religious Service of their Divinity, only this we now speak of employs only
<hi>Women.</hi> They call them <hi>Inibs,</hi> and all their Worship consists of Prayers and Sacrifices.
The Sacrifices and Offerings which they make their Gods, are Swine, Rice, <hi>Areca,</hi> some
of their kind of Drink, and Deer, and wild Boars heads. Having fed heartily upon them,
the Priestesses rise, and make a long Prayer, during which, a man shall see their Eyes turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their Heads, they fall to the ground, and make dreadful cries and shrieks. After
these efforts, they lie down all along upon the ground, immoveable as Statues, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so heavy, that five or six persons can hardly raise them. 'Tis while they are in this
posture, as they affirm, that their Gods communicate themselves to them, for an hour or
better. Then they get up on the top of the <hi>Pagode,</hi> go from one end of it to the other, and
there say their Prayers again; which being ended, they strip themselves stark naked,
shew their privy parts to their Gods, smiting them with their hands, and call for water to
wash themselves, in the presence of a great number of persons. 'Tis true, the men are not
guilty of so much devotion as to come often to these Assemblies; and the women, who
most frequent them, make a shift to get so drunk, that they hardly perceive what is done
before their faces.</p>

foretel good and ill fortune, rain and fair weather, and they have the power to drive away
the Devil, after a very ridiculous manner. They pursue him with a great noise, having
a <hi>Iaponnese</hi> Knife in their hand, and affirm, that by that means they drive him away so far,
as that he is forc'd to cast himself into the Sea, or at least into some River, where he is
drown'd. There are to be seen also at Cross-ways, and upon great Roads, a kind of Altars,

                     <p>The Cities are all built after the same manner, square, with good Brick-walls, plaister'd
over with the same Earth as they make the Porcelane of, which in process of time grows
so hard, that it will not be broken with a Hammer: which makes them last so long, that
it hath been observ'd, some of them have stood above two thousand years; yet is there not
the least appearance of any change to be seen in them. The Walls are very broad, and
flank'd with Towers, built after the ancient way of Architecture, much resembling the
Fortifications of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two spacious Streets commonly divide their Cities into a perfect Cross,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </note> and they are so
straight, that though they reach the whole length of the City, how great soever it be, yet
may a man see, from the middle, the four Gates of it. Several other Streets abut upon
these in divers places of the City, where they are disposed into Market-places, and other
publick conveniences. The Houses are fair and well built, especially those of Persons of
Quality, which have their Gardens, Orchards, Groves, Fountains, Conduits, Ducking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds,
Aviaries and Warrens; and they are painted or whiten'd on the out-side. They
have most of them three Doors all on the same side, whereof that which stands in the
middle is bigger then the other two, and they are for the most part so neatly wrought, that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47786:284"/>
it must be confessed, all we know of Architecture comes not near their excellency in it:
and they do all things the more magnificently, in that they want neither excellent Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
nor Materials to embellish their Structures.</p>
                     <p>There is no Kingdom or Commonwealth in the World, where they are so careful, not
only of repairing the High-wayes, but also in ordering all things so, as that Travellers
may not want any convenience, in so much that a man shall find Mountains levell'd, and
wayes cut through Rocks, yet more even and incomparably better paved then our
Streets, nay then even those of the City of <hi>Xuntien,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of this Monarchy,
whereof we shall give a short account anon, when we come to the description of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
                     <p>The Province of <hi>Peking</hi> is so called,<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Peking.</hi> Its Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</note> by reason of the City of <hi>Xuntien,</hi> where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>China</hi> ordinarily resides; for the word signifies, a <hi>Northerly Palace,</hi> as that
of <hi>Nanking,</hi> a <hi>Southerly Palace,</hi> but the true name of it is <hi>Pecheli.</hi> It hath towards the
East, the Gulf of <hi>Canghai,</hi> which divides it from <hi>Corea;</hi> towards the North-east the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Leaotung;</hi> towards the North the Wall, which divides it from that of <hi>Tartary</hi>
which lies beyond the Deserts of <hi>Xamo;</hi> towards the West, the Province of <hi>Xansi,</hi> from
which it is divided by the Mountain of <hi>Heng;</hi> towards the North-west, the Province
of <hi>Honan,</hi> and the River of <hi>Croceus;</hi> and towards the South and South-east, the Province
of <hi>Xantung.</hi> It hath eight great Cities, to wit, <hi>Xuntien, Paoting, Hokien, Chinting, Xunte,
Quanping,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Its Cities.</note> 
                        <hi>Taming,</hi> and <hi>Iungping,</hi> which might pass for so many Provinces, since there are
under their jurisdiction a hundred twenty and seven Cities of a middle sort. But what
most think very strange, is, that though the more Northerly part of this Province reaches
not beyond the forty second degree, yet is it so cold there, that from the midst of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
to <hi>March,</hi> all the Rivers are frozen up.</p>
                     <p>The Register which the <hi>Chineses</hi> keep of their Country,<note place="margin">The number of its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</note> makes it appear that there are
in this Province, a hundred and eighteen thousand, nine hundred eighty nine Families, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of above three millions, four hundred and fifty thousand persons, and that it payes
yearly to the Emperour, six hundred and one thousand, one hundred fifty and three Bags

Money which comes in by the Customs: and yet this is one of the less fruitful Provinces
of <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the City of <hi>Xuntien,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Xuntien <hi>described.</hi>
                        </note> it is situated at the extremity of the Kingdom, towards the
North, about thirty Leagues from the great Wall. It owes its greatness, though in that
particular it comes short of <hi>Nanking,</hi> to <hi>Taicung,</hi> who lived at the beginning of the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Age, and translated the Seat of the Empire from <hi>Nanking</hi> to this City. It is more
populous then that of <hi>Nanking,</hi> and must needs be more sumptuous, by reason of the Court,
and the great number of Souldiers which the King maintains there, as well for the safety
of the City, as that of his own person. On the South-side it is encompassed with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Ditch, and a double Wall; on the North-side it hath but one. This Wall is much
higher then those of any Cities in <hi>Europe,</hi> and so thick, that twelve Horse might ride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breast
upon it without touching one another. There is a Guard kept upon it in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
with as much vigilance as if there were an open War; but in the day-time, the Gates
are kept only by Eunuchs, who stand there rather to receive the Duties of Entrance, then
for any safety of the City. This is the same City which <hi>Marc Paulo</hi> calls <hi>Cambalu,</hi> and
whereof the <hi>Tartars</hi> were possessed at that time.</p>
                     <p>The Streets of it are not paved;<note place="margin">The Palace.</note> so that in Winter a man goes up to the ankles in dirt;
and in the Summer, he is cover'd all over with dust: but this inconvenience hath forced
them to make use of an invention, whence they derive much greater conveniences. For
they all cover themselves with a thin Lawn, from the head to the waste, and by that
means, not being known, they are not obliged to salute any they meet; and so dressed
they may ride undiscover'd on horse-back all about the City; which yet is not very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
in Persons of Quality, who, by this convenience, save the charge it would be to
them to be carried in Chairs, whereas they may have Horses and Mules to hire at the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of every Street, at a very easie rate, three or four pence a day.</p>
                     <p>The Kings Palace is near a League in compass, and fortified with three good Walls, and
so many Ditches. It hath four Gates, whereof that on the South-side, which opens upon
the great Street of the City, is the fairest. Persons of Quality may go within the first
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47786:284"/>
Wall, and Lords of the Councel go within the second; but within the third there go on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Women and Eunuchs who attend about the Kings person. They say this Palace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
within, of near eighty Halls, and, of those, four, which are the richest in the World;
besides the other Appartments, which are almost innumerable.</p>
                     <p>The Province of <hi>Xansi</hi> is not so great as that of <hi>Peking,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Its Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</note> Accordingly, that of <hi>Heng</hi> divides it on the East-side from the Province of

The River <hi>Croceus</hi> divides it, Westward, from the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi> and, towards the South,

are here some of Fire. They dam them up so, as that they leave only some Holes, on which
they set their Pots with Meat to be dressed. There are here also good store of Pit-coal,

Mountain supplies its place, and defends the Kingdom against the invasion of the

which come out of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and hath Houses, Redoubts and Forts, from place to place, for
the quartering of the Souldiers appointed for the keeping of it; in which work the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

                     <p>The same difference is to be observed in the Fruits.<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Fruits in <hi>China.</hi>
                        </note> For the more Southerly Provinces
bring forth <hi>Cocoes, Bannana's,</hi> and such other Fruits as grow only in hot Countreys; and
others bring forth Figs, Apples, Pears, Chesnuts, and such Fruits as are common in <hi>Europe.</hi>
But it may be said in general of <hi>China,</hi> that there is not any other Country more pleasant
or more fertile then it. 'Tis true, it is much obliged to Nature, from whose liberality it
hath Gold, Silver, precious Stones, Musk, Silk, Salt, and all sorts of precious Gums and
Drugs; but it must be confessed withall, that it is the labour and industry of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
and the mildness of its Government, which occasions this abundance of provisions,
and consummates the felicity wherein they live.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:47786:287"/>
The Country is so populous, that to maintain so strange a number of people, it is but
necessary,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> hate idleness.</note> that all the Ground it takes up should produce somewhat or other. They have
a natural aversion for idleness; but if they had not, the Laws have made such provision, in
this particular, that there is not any Crime punished with greater infamy then this Vice.
Another humour of theirs is, that they are lovers of good Chear, and pride it much in
wearing good Clothes, and having their Houses well furnished, so that, to live handsomly,
they are obliged to take pains. Hence comes it, that a man shall not see a Mountain but
is planted, not a Hill but is cultivated; no Plain, but is sown; no Fen, but some
advantage is made thereof; nay, to use the common expression, not an inch of Ground,
but brings forth somewhat or other, to requite their labour, who bestow their pains
on it.</p>
                     <p>This Country breeds all sort of living Creatures,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>China</hi> Fruits bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ours.</note> and brings forth all the Fruits and
Simples we have in <hi>Europe,</hi> but all much better in their several kinds then any we have;
as may be seen by those Oranges, the Plant whereof was brought thence into <hi>Portugal,</hi>
and the Fruit whereof is so highly esteem'd every where. The like may be said of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,
and other Fruits, especially Plums, which are most excellent there, and so wholsome,
that they never burden the Stomack, though a man eat never so many of them. There is
such abundance of Honey and Wax,<note place="margin">Wax and Honey.</note> that whole Fleets come thence loaden therewith; and
Sugar is so cheap that when it is dearest,<note place="margin">Sugar.</note> the <hi>Quintal,</hi> that is, a hundred twenty four pound,
may be bought between twenty four and thirty shillings <hi>sterling.</hi> A man may judge of
the quantities of Silk it produces, by the Stuffs which the Provinces pay in yearly to the
King, besides the Stuffs and raw Silk which are carried into all other parts of the World.
The high Grounds bring forth Wheat, Barly, Oats; and the low Grounds, Rice,
but in such abundance, that, when most dear, it is sold at a Crown the Coom, or four
<hi>Winchesters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fowl are sold there by the pound,<note place="margin">Flesh very cheap.</note> and when the Feathers are off, the ordinary rate is
three half pence a pound, and all other Flesh proportionably: for there is so much Cattel,
that a fat Cow is not worth above ten shillings; a Buffer a Crown; a Hog, the flesh
whereof is very delicate,<note place="margin">Spice.</note> twenty pence. Nay, even Spices are so cheap there, that under
a Crown a man may buy four hundred Nutmegs, and for half a Crown two pound of
Cloves; which proceeds hence, that Provisions yielding in a manner nothing in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
the <hi>Chineses</hi> truck them with so much profit to the <hi>Moluccas</hi> and the other neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Islands, that they can afford these Drugs cheaper then they may be had at the places
where they grew. The Sea, which encompasses a great part of this vast Territory, and the
Rivers which are as it were so many Veins and Arteries to this vast Body, supply it with
such abundance of Fish, that it is to be had in a manner for nothing.</p>
                     <p>For there is hardly any City that hath the convenience of a River, but the Inhabitants
keep a great number of Cormorants,<note place="margin">Their fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> which they make use of in order to fishing. They
are kept fasting one day, and the next they carry them to the water-side, near several Boats
half full of water, whereto they are fastened with a Cord tied under their Wings, and
having bound them about their Necks a little above the Stomack, they let them go into
the River, where they fill, with Fish, that Skin which stretches like a bag under the Throat,
and come and disburden themselves, of what they had taken, in the Boat whereto they
are fastened. This they do several times, at least till such time as the Master thinks they
have taken enough; and then he unties the String which ties up their Necks, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them to go a fishing for themselves, and to feast themselves for two dayes: and by
this means they take more Fish then they are able to consume.</p>
                     <p>There is no Creature so common all over <hi>China</hi> as the Duck,<note place="margin">How they breed Ducks.</note> in regard they have a way
for the breeding of them, not known in other parts. They are kept in great Cages, made
of Canes, and set at the Sterns of great Boats, the Cages being so large, as they are able to
contain three or four thousand of them,<note place="margin">How hatched.</note> and they hatch the Eggs, in the Summer time, in
Cow-dung, or haply in the Dung of the Ducks themselves, which is very hot, leaving them
therein, till the generation be compleated, and then they break the Shells one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to make way for their young ones to come out, with such a sleight, that it seldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
that any one of them miscarries.</p>
                     <p>In the Winter, they heighten the natural heat of the Dung by Fire, making a Bed of
Canes, raised three or four foot from the ground, upon which they set the Eggs between
two layers of Dung, and there is a Fire made under, to give them that degree of heat
which is requisite for the hatching of them. As soon as they are hatched, they dispose
them into the Cages, where they keep old Ducks, which receive them under their Wings,
and breed them up. When they are grown big enough to shift for themselves, they give
them in the morning a little Rice, but only so much as rather sharpens then satisfies the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47786:287"/>
Appetite, and then they open the Cages, to let them go over a kind of Hurdle of Canes to
the shore, where they suffer them to feed among the Rice, out of which they pick the
Weeds with so much ease and advantage to the Owner, that he who breeds the Ducks is
sufficiently recompenced for his pains. In the evening, he gets all his Ducks together, and
makes them return into the Boat, with the noise of a Whistle or little Bell, which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
so exactly, that, though there are many times twenty or five and twenty thousand of
them together, yet will they all get very orderly into their Cages: and by this kind of
breeding, they are so cheap, that a man may have two or three for a penny.</p>
                     <p>As to the Inhabitants,<note place="margin">The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</note> they are well shaped, and for the most part of a good stature.
The Men have large Faces, are small Ey'd, and flat Nosed, wearing little or no Beard. They
never cut their Hair, nor pare the Nails of the left Hand, out of a perswasion, that their
Nails may be serviceable to them in climbing, when they shall be taken up into Heaven by
the Hair.</p>
                     <p>They are all clad after the same fashion,<note place="margin">Their cloathing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> save that in the more Northerly Provinces, they
use Furs, and in the more Southerly, they go for the most part in Silk. Persons of great
quality have their Cassocks embroidered up to the Waste, but others have only a little Gold
or Silver about the extremities: and there is this distinction between married Men and
Batchelors, that the latter part their Hair upon the Forehead, and wear higher Caps then
the others.</p>
                     <p>The Women are very sumptuously clad,<note place="margin">Their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> having about them a great many Pearls and
precious Stones. They also paint, and dress their Heads with as much curiosity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
as in any other place of the World. They have a particular affection of having
little feet; whence it comes, that the Mothers make it their business, so to straiten their
Daughters Feet, from their Infancy, that they are hardly able to go. Some are of opinion,
that this Custom was introduced by those who were desirous to accustom Women to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary
life, whereto they are as it were condemned even from their birth. They are never
seen in the House; and it is very seldom they go abroad, which when they do, it is to
visit some of their nearest Relations; and then, they are so attended, and shut up in <hi>Palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins,</hi>
that they cannot be seen.</p>
                     <p>The Men are ingenious enough,<note place="margin">Are ingenious.</note> and discover, by their Works, that they are not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to the <hi>Europeans.</hi> It is no easie matter for a Man to avoid the circumventions of
their Merchants, who make use of all imaginable Advantages in their Dealings. At every
Door there hangs a Table, containing a Catalogue of all the Commodities that are in
the Shop: and in regard all the Merchants of the same Body have their habitations in
the same quarter, a man finds, as soon as he comes into it, what is to be sold in all the Street.</p>
                     <p>They use Brass-money in no Province but that of <hi>Chekiang;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> in all other parts of the
Kingdom, only Gold and Silver is current, which yet is received only by weight, without
any regard of the mark. Whence it comes, that no <hi>China</hi> Merchant but hath his Weights
about him, and such pieces of Money as are full weight, by which that which he receives
is to be weighed.</p>
                     <p>I am of opinion,<note place="margin">The provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the subsistance of the poor.</note> that the provision, which is made in several parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the Poor, was derived from <hi>China.</hi> Beggary, which is infamous in those who
are reduced thereto, and a shame to such as suffer it, in as much as it is a reproach of their
want of Charity, whose care it should be to remedy that inconvenience, is there very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
forbidden; and there is in all Cities a particular Judge appointed for the Poor, who,
in order to their relief, takes the following course.</p>
                     <p>The very day he comes into that Employment, he publishes an Order, whereby he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
all those who have any Children, either born weak or imperfect, or become such,
through sickness or any other accident, to come and make their cases known, that he may
examine whether they are capable of learning any Trade or not; and in case they are not,
whether the Parents are able to maintain them. If they are Orphans, and have no other
Friends able to keep them, they are disposed into Hospitals, where they are brought up at
the Kings charge. The same course is taken with maimed or decrepit Souldiers. They
are all lock'd up, and not permitted to go any more abroad. The Houses, where they put
up the Poor, have Gardens and Courts belonging to them, where they are permitted to
keep Poultry and Swine, as well for their divertisement as advantage, and the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
a certain Overseer, who, joyntly with the ordinary Judge, makes a Visitation of the
Hospitals twice a year.</p>
                     <p>They do not put the blind into the number of those Poor who are accounted unable to
work; but they are employed in pulling the Bell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> at Smiths Forges, and other things
which do not much require the help of the fight. Maids that are blind are forced to a
Trade, which may be as gainful, but not so honest as some others.</p>

I conceive I may also presume to affirm, that it is to <hi>China</hi> we are obliged for the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Printing.<note place="margin">Printing in <hi>China</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had it.</note> For it is certain, we have it but since the year 1450. and that the <hi>Chine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
have some Books printed above seven hundred years since.</p>
                     <p>They have a way of Writing particular to themselves, not only upon this account, that
they make use of Figures rather then Characters,<note place="margin">Their way of writing.</note> in as much as they signifie entire words,
and do not represent the Letters; but also upon this, that, in their Writing they observe
an order wholly different from that of all other Nations. For these write either from the
left hand to the right, as all the <hi>Europeans</hi> do, or from the right to the left, as the <hi>Hebrews,
Arabians,</hi> and most of the other Nations of <hi>Asia</hi> do; but the <hi>Chineses</hi> write from the top
downwards, and in their Writing observe such equal distances, that there cannot be any
thing more exact. And to shew, that these Figures stand not for any word that hath any
particular signification in their Language, but that they express the same things, it is to be
noted, that the <hi>Chineses,</hi> who, when they speak, cannot understand one the other, by reason
of the diversity of the Idioms and Dialects that is among the Inhabitants of several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
make use of these Characters, not only to render themselves intelligible one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
all over the Kingdom, but also in their Commerce with the <hi>Iaponneses,</hi> and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Corea</hi> and <hi>Conchinchine,</hi> between whose Languages there is no more rapport, then
the <hi>English</hi> hath to the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Arabian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They make their Paper of the Bark of <hi>Bambus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> or Canes, but so thin, that it will bear
writing but on one side, though they do not use Pens, but Pencils, as the <hi>Iaponneses</hi> do,
which only slide along the Paper, so that they write as fast, and cut their Characters so
neatly, that the best Pen-men in <hi>Europe</hi> are not to be preferred before them.</p>
                     <p>The King is at a vast charge, as well in the maintenance of the Schools, where they are
taught to read and write, as also the other Elements and Sciences, as in that of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
where are taught Philosophy, natural and moral, Astrology, and the other Sciences.
There passes not a year, but there is a Visitation made, at which the Professors and Scholars
are examined; and they who express an inclination to study are recompenced; such as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
not themselves thereto as they ought, are punished.</p>
                     <p>The Visitor having ended the general <hi>Examen,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The dignity of <hi>Loytia.</hi>
                        </note> makes another particular one for those
who aspire to the quality of <hi>Loytia,</hi> a Dignity there like that of our Doctors. True
it is, that they give this Title to all nobly descended; but in matter of Learning, it is a
Degree, conferr'd, by giving the Graduate a permission to wear a Girdle, by which he
is distinguished from others. For the King bestows this quality, as the Princes of our
parts confer Honours on those who have deserved them by their services, or are so much
in favour, either with them or such as are about them, as to get them by Letters Patents.
This promotion of Doctors is done with as great Ceremonies, as in any <hi>European</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.</p>
                     <p>But indeed this Nation is so punctual in point of Ceremony,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> very cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious.</note> that it goes beyond any
other, even to importunity. The first Lectures they make to Youth are those of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whereof there are whole Books, that they may be sure to have them upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
If a man hath but once seen a person, he is obliged to salute him, and this is not
done with the Hat, but closing the left hand, they put it into the right, and so both to the
breast, with a low inclination of the head, accompanied with protestations to confirm what
they would express by their gestures.</p>
                     <p>Persons of Quality meeting in the Street, make a stand, joyn their hands by putting the
fingers one within another, and stretching out the arms bow-wise, they do their reverences
with low inclinations, and continue a good while in that posture, proffering one another
the way. When there is no equality between the persons who meet, the inferiour gives
way to the other, does him reverence, and lets him pass by. He who goes to speak about
any business to a <hi>Loytia</hi> at his own Lodgings, kneels down as soon as he comes into the
Room, and advances, and continues in that posture till he hath done speaking, or delivered
his Petition, and having done his business, he retires still kneeling, without turning his back
on the <hi>Loytia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a man standing at his own Door, or in the Street, espy a Kinsman, or Friend, coming
out of the Country, if he who lives in the City thinks not himself well enough clad to
welcome his Friend as he would, he will pretend not to have seen him, go into his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
put on his best Clothes, and then will come and meet his Friend, and salute him, as if
he had not seen him before. If he meet him in the Street at some distance from his own
House, the first question he makes is, whether he hath din'd or supp'd, if not, he will carry
him to the next Tavern, and treat him magnificently with Fish and Flesh; if he hath din'd,
he will give him only a Collation of Fruits and Conserves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:47786:288"/>
They are very sumptuous in their Treatments, and have a custom different from what is
done in all other places.<note place="margin">Their Feast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> They set up as many Tables as there are guests; but instead of
cloths, which would hide the beauty of the gilding and painting, wherewith they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched,
they have only carpets of Damask, Taffata, or some other Silk stuff, which cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only the edges thereof, hang down to the ground. At the four corners of the Table
they set a paper of Fruits and Conserves for the Desert, and several figures of Sugar, made
and painted to the life, and flowers for the divertisement of the Eye, and they set the
meat in the midst.</p>
                     <p>They use either Silver-plate or Porcelane,<note place="margin">Plate.</note> and have no Napkins, in regard they
make use of their forks so neatly, that they never have any occasion to wipe either
their hands or mouths. They drink often, but little at a time, whence it comes their
drinking cups are very small; and whereas they serve up many dishes, they are very
long at meals: but that the guests might not be weary, they give them all manner
of divertisements, as Musick, Plays, tricks of Legerdemain, and Puppet-showes. If
it be a person of quality that is invited, they set up in the Hall where the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is made, several other Tables, on which are all sorts of tame and wild Fowl,
all which are carried away by several servants marching in a file before him,
when he returns home, whither having brought them, they, with great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements,
oblige him to suffer them to leave at his own house what he had
not consumed at their Masters. The treatments they make for a Governour of a
Province lasts sometimes fifteen days or three weeks, and costs them a years Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
who undertake any such thing, what ever their Estates may be. Their
entertainments are commonly in the night, making choice of some time about
the change of the Moon, especially that of <hi>March,</hi> with which they begin their
year.</p>
                     <p>That day they all spend in merriment, put on their best clothes, hang their houses with
the richest stuffs they have,<note place="margin">Their new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>years day.</note> cover the streets with Roses and other flowers, adorn their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal
Arches with branch'd works, Damask and silk Tapestry, beset with Torches, and
plant before the door a tree so enlightned, that though there were but one in a whole
street, it might give light to the whole quarter. Their Priests are present at these pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
rejoycings, and adde to the solemnities of the day by the Sacrifices they make to
their Gods.</p>
                     <p>Speaking of their <hi>civility,</hi> I shall here give an accompt of that which they
have particularly for the Embassadours of Forreign Princes,<note place="margin">The honour they do Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours.</note> for whom the <hi>Chineses</hi>
have the same veneration and respect, as they might express to their own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
                     <p>They do not look on the occasion of the Embassie, but the quality of the Prince
who sends the Embassadour, who is received at the entrance of the Kingdom,
by the Governour of the first Frontier City, who meets him with all the persons
of Quality within his Government. They suffer him not to set his foot on the
ground; but assoon as he comes out of the Ship, he is put into an Ivory Chair, and
carried by eight men to a house appointed for that purpose, which is furnished at the
Kings charge, and so spacious, that several Embassadours may be lodg'd therein at
the same time without any inconvenience. The next day, the Governour of the
City goes to wait on him, and endeavours to learn of him the occasion of his
Embassie, to be communicated to the Governour of the Province, who
immediately sends to the Embassadour, to desire his Credentials, that he
may dispatch them to the Court, and get thence the Pass-port requisite for the
prosecution of his journey. This Pass-port is upon Parchment, with the Kings
Seal in Gold, which is carried before the Embassadour, with the Credentials writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon a board, having over head in Golden letters the name of the Prince who
sends him. The Governours of Provinces make provision for his expence by the
way, and when he is come near the Metropolis, there meets him the President of
the Privy-Councel, who receives him in the head of all the Councellors, and most
of the Courtiers, and conducts the Embassadour to his Lodgings, and as he takes
leave of him, he empowers him to create a certain number of <hi>Loytias,</hi> and to set at
liberty some Condemn'd persons, the number whereof is regulated sutably to the
greatness of the Prince who sends him. They allow him a certain time to repose
himself, and then the same persons, who met him at his entrance, conduct him to his
Audience, which the King gives him as often as he desires it, and is present at all
the Propositions he makes.</p>
                     <p>The entertainments they make at Weddings, are very great, for the Brides Father
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47786:289"/>
gives her no other Portion then what he spends the first day, in treating the relations and
friends of his Son in Law;<note place="margin">Their wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> and the next day, those of the Bride. The Feasting being over,
the Husband delivers to his Wife, in the presence of her kindred, the Portion he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
her, and she gives it her Father or Mother, as a requital of the pains they had taken
in her Education; so that by this means such as have most Daughters are the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
especially if they be handsom. Maids are married very young, and the Father may
dispose of the Dower given his Daughter, if any necessity oblige him thereto; but if he
keep it, it is due to the Daughter, all the other Children being excluded from having any
benefit thereof.</p>
                     <p>Polygamy is lawful among them,<note place="margin">Polygamy lawful.</note> but incest severely forbidden, in a direct line, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie;
and in a collateral, to Sisters and Nieces. The first is the only lawful Wife, the rest
Concubines, insomuch that they do not only not live in the same Lodgings with the first,
but also her eldest Son Inherits as much of the Estate himself, as all the rest put together.
If the first wife have no Son, or having any, if he die before the Father, the eldest by the
other wives succeeds him in his right, and represents the heir apparent of the Family.</p>
                     <p>A man seldom hears of any Adulteries committed among them; for the women are
kept in such restraint, that they are in a manner inaccessible. The Husband hath the same
power, as in other places, to kill the Adulteress and her Gallant, if he take them in the Act:
but in regard it is a self-ended and self-conceited Nation, they choose rather to make their
advantage otherwise of such an accident, then defame themselves by a severity, which
saves their reputation only in appearance.</p>

which signifies Emperour of dirt or earth, so to be distinguished, from <hi>Xanhi,</hi> who
is the great Emperour of the Universe. They say, that he who first took the name of

more infallible, then those of reason grounded on experience. The President of this

                     <p>The Officers are changed every three years, and from the day of their departure from
Court, or the place of their ordinary Habitation, the King defrayes all their Charges,
leaving it to their choice, whether they will take their allowance in provision or mony.
While they continue in their employment, they are lodg'd and treated at the Kings
charge, and there are lodg'd neer the Judges in the same house, the Clerks, Door-keepers,
and all the other Officers belonging to their charge, who are also maintain'd and paid
by the King, that they may take no bribes or gratifications from the parties.</p>
                     <p>They are so circumspect in all their proceedings,<note place="margin">Debtors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

a more delicate Constitution, many times expire.</p>
                     <p>The course taken for the discovery of Crimes,<note place="margin">An admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble order.</note> and to prevent several other disorders, is
admirable. The Judges coming to the place of their residence, cause a List to be taken of
all the houses within their jurisdiction, and having distributed them into Decads, they
set a bill on every tenth house, injoyning the Inhabitants to discover such of their Decad as
they know hath committed any crimes, upon pain of being responsible for the same them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
as also to give notice of such of their Decad, as remove from their houses, or intend
any great journey, that they may be oblig'd to pay their debts, before they leave the quarter.</p>
                     <p>They have no mercy on Criminals, yet is there not any person Executed, till the crime
be made so apparent, that the criminal can alledge nothing for himself. They endeavour
to get out the truth by fair means, and never order any to be tortured, but upon very
great presumptions; but then they do it cruelly.</p>
                     <p>They put their fingers between two sticks,<note place="margin">Their To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whereof they draw a strong pack-thred, which they bind so hard, that they break the
bones, and make the nailes come off. Another torture they have is, to put the feet between
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47786:290"/>
two boards, much after the same manner, as in some parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> they put the Leggs
into boots full of hot oyle, save that, there the feet are tormented, and here the leggs.</p>
                     <p>Every great City hath several Prisons,<note place="margin">Prisons.</note> which are very strictly kept, but have belonging
to them Courts, Gardens, Ponds, and Walks for the divertisement of such as are detained
there for slight offences. They have also drinking-houses, for the convenience of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and Shops, wherein are sold such things as the Prisoners make, in order to their
better subsistance.</p>
                     <p>The Sentence of death is not executed till the King hath confirmed it; nay, even that
had, it is done with so many Ceremonies, that unless the heynousness of the Crime cry for
Vengeance very loud, there are more Condemn'd persons languish in the Prisons, then die
by the hand of the Executioner. For there is no Execution, but in presence of the chief
Judge of the Province, or Visitor, who being come to the place, calls for the Indictments
of such as stand condemned to die, and examine them, and thereupon either confirms or
repeals the sentence of the ordinary Judge. Of those whose Sentence is confirm'd, he
takes fifty of the greatest offenders, and orders the Goaler to prepare them for their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Yet are they not brought out of the Prison, till they are once more examined;
and if they can alledge any receivable excuse, they are shut up again, and then they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the great Guns, to shew that they are going to Execution. But before they are
brought to the place of punishment, they are examined once more, and the Judge presses
them to think of themselves, and to find out some pretence that might oblige him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it. If they have nothing to alledge, he orders so many Guns to be fired, as there are
persons to be executed. Being come to the place of execution, they are set upon heaps of
Ashes, where they have somewhat given them to eat, and then begins the last examination:
but if, that over, they have no excuse, the Guns are discharged the third time, and the
execution is compleated.</p>
                     <p>Their punishments are,<note place="margin">Their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</note> to hang up, to empale, to burn; but this last is only for such as
are guilty of high Treason.</p>
                     <p>They have a particular punishment for Thieves.<note place="margin">That of Thieves.</note> For as they detest Theft above all
Crimes, so is its punishment attended with more infamy then the others. They lay the
Malefactor upon his belly, with his hands ti'd behind him, and in that posture, two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners
beat him with all their might upon the calf of the Leg, with great Canes
moystned in water, which is so painful a chastisement, that most of the wretches die under
their hands. The Judges are present at these executions; but that they may not be
moved to compassion, which the Condemned would never be the better for, they spend
their time in gaming and drinking, and stop their ears against their cries.</p>
                     <p>But that Governours and Judges may not abuse their power,<note place="margin">The Visitors</note> they are obliged not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to give an account of their actions, at the expiration of their Commissions, before
Judges appointed for that purpose, whom they call <hi>Chenes;</hi> but also the King sends into
the Provinces a Visitor, whom they call <hi>Leaches.</hi> He goes into the Province <hi>incognito,</hi>
takes an exact and secret information of the Actions of the Officers, and having gone
round the Province, comes up near the Metropolis of it, towards the time that all the
Officers of the Province meet there, which is once a month; he sends to the Viceroy and
the Assembly to open the Gate to him, that he may come and acquaint them with the
King's pleasure. This message discovers his quality, and yet when he goes into the
Assembly, he hath his Commission carried open before him; and assoon as it is read, the
Viceroy comes out of his place, and the other Judges out of their seats, and do reverence
to the Visitor, who having taken the Viceroys place, commends those who have done
their duty, and tells them, he shall not fail to report the same to his Majesty.</p>
                     <p>Then turning to those whom he hath found Delinquent, he reproves them, deprives
them of the Marks of Magistracy, which are the Hat and Girdle, suspends, or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
dispossesses them of their charges, and puts others into them. It is in his power
to advance to the greatest dignities such as he judges capable thereof, to brand with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
those who have neglected their duty, nay, to punish them, but not with death; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as the Emperour only is Master of the lives of his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>As to the Religion of the <hi>Chineses,</hi>

some apprehensions of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and some would infer, that three Heads, which they
make coming out of the Body of one of their Idols, represent the <hi>blessed Trinity,</hi> which
makes the first and greatest Mistery of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion. They adde hereto, that
<hi>St. Thomas</hi> the Apostle Preached the Gospel in <hi>China,</hi> and that there are some Pictures to
be found there, wherein may be seen men dressed and shaped as the Apostles are painted
among us, and that some have seen their Images representing the <hi>blessed Virgin,</hi> holding
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47786:290"/>
the Saviour of the World in her Armes. But the se are only chimerical imaginations, since
that, setting aside the establishments which the <hi>Portuguez</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> have made there
some years since, there is not the least track to be seen of the Ancient <hi>Christian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>They affirm that all things,<note place="margin">Their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</note> visible and invisible, were made by Heaven. And this
they express by the first Letter of their Alphabet. They also believe that the Heaven
governs the Universe by a Vicegerent, whom they call <hi>Laocon Tzautey.</hi> For him it is they
have the greatest veneration next the Sun, and say, it is an eternal Spirit, who was not
created. They have the same opinion of another Divinity, whom they call <hi>Cansay,</hi> and
to whom they Attribute an absolute power over all Sublunary things. To these three
Spirits, they add three principal Ministers, whom they call <hi>Tanquam, Teiquam,</hi> and <hi>Tzu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquam,</hi>
whereof the first presides over the Air, and makes it rain; another, over the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of Men and other Animals, and the production of Fruits; and the third hath
the government of the Sea. They also canonize some, whose lives have been eminent
for Sanctity, or otherwise, and call them <hi>Pausaos,</hi> that is, Saints; but they do not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them the same Honours they do the Gods before mentioned, or yet the three follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Saints, who are also in great veneration among them.</p>

of King <hi>Tzonton,</hi> who having married his two elder Daughters, would also have this
embrace the same kind of life. But this Princess having made a Vow of Chastity, would
not hear of Marriage, and upon that account lost her Fathers favour, who shut her up in
a place, where her employment was, to carry Wood and Water, and to weed a great
Garden whereof she had the keeping. They have great Legends of the Life of this Saint,
and relate several stories of her; among others, that the Apes of the neighbouring Forrest
came thither, and carried Water for her; that the Birds weeded the Garden for her;
and that several other Creatures brought the wood she was obliged to fetch. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
imagining this was done by his Daughter's witchcraft, caused the house to be fired,
which the Princess seeing, and considering that it was for her sake, would have cut her
own throat, with a string of hair; but she immediately found the fire put out by a
great shower which then fell, whereupon she went thence and retired into the Deserts of
the neighbouring Mountain. The King's impiety was punished with the Leprosie, which
spread it self over all his body, wherein it bred so many Worms, that he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by them, if the Daughter, upon notice given her of it by a voice from Heaven,
had not relieved him. The misery he endured had raised in him a great remorse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
so that finding himself recovered by his Daughter's intercession, he fell down
on his knees before her, begg'd her pardon for what was past, and would have adored
her, but she refused those honours: yet so as that, it not being in her power to avoid
them, she set an Idol before her, and returned to the Desert, whence she came only to
cure her Father. She dyed there, and, by an extraordinary austerity of life, acquired so
great a reputation of sanctity, that they still honour her with a Religious worship, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
her, and beg her intercession for the remission of sins.</p>
                     <p>They have yet a third Saint,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

she was a Daughter of a Prince of the City of <hi>Yocheu,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Huquang.</hi>
The aversion she had conceived against Marriage, obliged her to retire into the Island of
<hi>Ingoa,</hi> where they say she wrought many Miracles. They relate, among others, that a
Lord named <hi>Compo,</hi> having received orders from the King to go along with a Fleet
which lay ready to set sail, it was not in the power of the Mariners to weigh the Anchors.
<hi>Compo</hi> was so surprised at the accident, that he would needs see himself what might be
the cause of it. He found <hi>Neoma</hi> sitting on the Anchor belonging to the Admiral. He
told her, the King had commanded him to go and make a War in one of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Provinces, and entreated her not to oppose his Design. She made answer, that she
would contribute to his gaining the Victory he promised himself in that Expedition, if he
would take her along with him: which he was the more inclinable to do, in regard he
already knew her by reputation. Accordingly, the Army was no sooner come in sight of
the Enemies Countrey, but she dissolved the Charm, whereby the Inhabitants had made
all the Sea look as if it had been on fire, and forced the Enemies to render themselves
up at mercy. <hi>Compo</hi> thought at first it had been an illusion; whereupon he would have
a stronger assurance of <hi>Neoma's</hi> power, and told her; he should make no further question

of her sanctity, if she could make the stick he had in his hand to flourish, and wax green
again; which she did. <hi>Compo</hi> planted his stick at the stern of his Ship, and openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that all the success of his Arms was to be attributed to <hi>Neoma;</hi> and thence

which came forth a pleasant scent, from whence were begotten males and females, and
that all now alive are descended from <hi>Lotzitzan,</hi> who, as they affirm, lived nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years: That the Heaven begot also another man, named <hi>Atzion,</hi> by a very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
production, inasmuch as his Mother, whom they call <hi>Lutim,</hi> was got with child,
by looking on the head of the Lyon in the Zodiack, and that she was brought to bed in

They believe also a kind of Purgatory, and that there is a certain place, where Souls are
to be cleansed from the impurities they derived from the bodies which they had informed;
and that, as to this particular, the Suffrages of their Friends and Relations may procure
them some refreshment. Whence it comes, that, in <hi>August,</hi> they have a Day appointed
for Prayers and supplications to be made for the Deceased: but instead of performing
these Ceremonies in their <hi>Pagodes,</hi> they do them in the private Houses of such as are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to this kind of Devotion: To that end, three of their Religious men go to the House
appointed, and exhort the Family to make the Prayers requisite for the purging of those
sins which obstruct the Beatitude of their deceased Relations. Of these three Religious
men, one carries a little Drum; another certain Images; and the third, a small Bell.
Having set the Images upon the Altar, they Incense them, while in the mean time some
others are busied in setting, on five or six Tables, certain Dishes of Meat, for the Saints
and Souls of the Deceased, and that done, they fall a-dancing, and singing certain Hymns,
which the younger of the Religious men writes down on Paper, and afterwards lays on the
Altar. Assoon as he is returned to his place, they fall a-singing again, till such time as
he who says the Service strikes his Image against the Table, whereto the others answer
with their heads, and that done, they burn the Images before the Altar. Having spent the
night in this kind of Devotion, which is not begun till after Sun set, the Religious men, and
those of the House make good chear with what they find on the Tables, and had been set
there for the spirits of the other World: and thus they procure the purgation of the
Souls departed.</p>
                     <p>Most of them do also believe the Transmigration of Souls,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>And</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chosis.</note> but few speak of it with any
rational ground.</p>
                     <p>They have four Orders of Religious men, whereof some are clad in black, some in
white,<note place="margin">Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men</note> and some in a dark grey. Every Order hath its General, whom they call <hi>Tricon,</hi>
who lives in the City of <hi>Xuntien.</hi> He hath under him Provincials, who make Visitations
within their several Jurisdictions, to see that there be an observance of Discipline, and
that there be no remission of the rigour required by the Rules of the Order. These
have also the nomination of Superiours and Guardians in the several Monasteries. The
General continues in that dignity as long as he lives, and when he dies, the King names
his successour, making choice of him among those who are most deserving. He is cloth'd
in Silk, but of the same colour as is worn by the Religious men of the Order, and never
goes out of his own house, without a retinue of four Religious men, who carry him in
an Ivory Chair, upon their shoulders. He hath a particular Seal for such affairs as concern
his Order, and his Religious men never speak to him but on their knees. The King allows
him what may keep a plentiful house, and contributes also to the subsistance of the Monks
in the Monasteries; and if they want any thing, it is supplied by the liberality of private
persons. The Religious men are all clad in serge, and all after the same fashion, save that
they are distinguished by the colour.<note place="margin">Vse Beads.</note> They all shave their heads and beards. They use
beads, and say their Mattens and other Offices, much after the same manner as our Monks
in <hi>Europe</hi> do. Those who enter into the Monastery make a feast for all the Monks; but
the eldest Son of a Family is not permitted to take the habit; in regard the Laws of the
Kingdom forbid it, and would have him to be the comfort and support of the weak and
decrepit age of his Father. Their vows are not indispensable, but they may quit the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
and marry.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chineses</hi> observe at their Funerals the following Ceremonies.<note place="margin">Funeral Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</note> Assoon as any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is deceased, they wash the body, put about him his best cloathes well perfum'd, and set
him in the biggest Chair they can find in the house: That done, the Wife, Children,
Brothers, Sisters, and afterwards all the Relations, kneel down before him, and take their
leave of him. That Ceremony over, they put him into a Coffin of sweet-wood well
closed, and set him upon a Table, or two tressels, and they cover him with a Hearse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath,
reaching down to the ground, upon which they draw the Picture of the deceased.
They leave him in that posture fifteen days, during which time, in some other Chamber
or Hall, there stand constantly set on a Table, Wine, Fruit, and two wax Torches light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for the Priests, who spend the night there in singing and praying, according to their
way; but especially in making divers inchantme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

several Images and fastning others to the Hearse-cloath, which covers the Coffin,
which Images they ever and anon move with their hands, thinking they by that means
force the Soul to Heaven. The fifteen days being over, the body is carryed into the
Country, where the Priests interr it, and commonly plant a Pine-tree neer the Sepulchre;
whence it comes, that they have a particular ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Their mourning is austere enough. Sons continue it for a whole year, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

but <hi>Thienzung,</hi> King of <hi>Tartary,</hi> dying in the year 1636. <hi>Zungte,</hi> his Son, (who had been
brought up in his infancy in <hi>China,</hi> where the manner of living of that Country had been
instill'd into him) succeeded him, and by his liberality corrupted most of the Governours
and <hi>Chinese</hi> Commanders, who thereupon sided with him; especially when they saw that
the distractions which then shook the State, wherein there were eight Armies of <hi>Tories,</hi>
or common Rogues, at the same time, were absolutely contrary to the preservation of the
Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>These Armies were disposed, in the year 1641. under two Generals, whereof one was
called <hi>Licungzo,</hi> the other <hi>Chanchienchung,</hi> who divided the Provinces between them, so
as that the former had the command in <hi>Xensi</hi> and <hi>Honan,</hi> and the other, in <hi>Suchuen</hi> and
<hi>Huquang. Licungzo</hi> having taken in the chief Cities of these two Provinces, assumed
the quality of King, and would be called <hi>Xunuang,</hi> that is, the fortunate King; and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to become Master of the whole Empire, would needs have the Title of Emperour,
and that his Family should have the name of <hi>Thienxun,</hi> that is, obedient to Heaven.
And indeed Heaven seem'd to comply with his perfidiousness, by the intrigues which in
the mean time were carried on at Court, where all the Grandees were divided into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
through the means of a Favourite, of whom we shall here take occasion to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.</p>
                     <p>Under the Reign of <hi>Thienki,</hi> there was, at Court, an Eunuch, named <hi>Guei:</hi> who was so
much in favour with the Emperour, that the latter call'd the other Father. This man,
who had been raised to that greatness, in a manner from the Dunghill, abused his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and made his Ministry odious, by the ill treatment they received from him, who had
too much courage to become his Courtiers and Adorers. He was so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mpudent, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himself against the Prince, who was looked upon as Heir apparent to the Crown, in
as much as <hi>Thienki</hi> had no Children, and to oppose his establishment after the Emperours
death. This Prince was <hi>Zungchini,</hi> whom we spoke of before, and of whom we shall have
occasion to speak hereafter. He prov'd so fortunate as to elude the Artifices of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,
and got the Crown on his Head, without much contestation, but he had not so
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47786:293"/>
much power as to smother the Factions, into which the Court was divided by the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
of the Favourite. As soon as he came to the Crown, he gave the Eunuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
very honourable in appearance, but in effect very fatal to him; for he commanded
him to go and visit the Sepulchres of his Ancestors, and to give order there should be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
amiss about them: but as soon as he was gone from <hi>Peking, Zunchini</hi> sent after him
a Messenger, who presented him with a gilt Box, wherein there was a Silken Halter, and
told him, that the Emperour had commanded him to bring an account of his death. But
this Execution reconciled not those who had engaged either for or against him, during his
life, and the aversion which the Emperour openly expressed towards his Abettors, only
augmented the number of discontented and treacherous persons, which were on both sides;
in so much that most of the Grandees, minding only their private Affairs, they either neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
sending the relief which the Governours of the Provinces required against the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
or maliciously dissembled the need they stood in thereof: and by that means, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
had time to make sure work on their side.</p>
                     <p>

save only that of <hi>Thaiyuen,</hi> which was taken by storm, and plunder'd. The Emperour,
hearing that the Rebels had passed the River <hi>Hoangh,</hi> and fearing they might beset him in
the City of <hi>Xuntien,</hi> would have retreated to <hi>Nanking;</hi> but he was perswaded to the
contrary by his Council, it being the intention of some by that means to keep up the
reputation of his Armes, of others, to deliver him up to <hi>Lizungzo;</hi> so that he sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Rebels a powerful Army, under the Command of the <hi>Colao,</hi> or President of

how things stood at Court, sent some of his people into the City, who, under pretence of
keeping a Tavern, or opening Shops for Mercery, were to make a Rising, when they heard
the Army was advanced near the City. Some affirm, he had corrupted him who had the
Command of the City, and that by his Order he found one of the Gates open, at which
he entred it, in <hi>April</hi> 1644. and afterwards became Master of the Palace, before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
had any notice of his coming. The Traitors, who had kept him from hearing of
it, prevented him also from getting away: so that perceiving <hi>Lizungzo</hi> was possessed of
all the Avenues of the Castle, and thinking it too great a dishonour to submit to the
Commander of a sort of Robbers, he with his own hands kill'd an only Daughter he
had, so to secure her honour, which she could not have kept with her life; and going
into the Garden, he took off one of his Garters, and hung himself at a Plum-tree. The
<hi>Colao,</hi> the Queen, and some of his Eunuchs, followed his example, and hung themselves
in the same Garden. <hi>Zunchini</hi> left three Sons, whereof the two youngest had their
Heads cut off, three dayes after the Fathers death, but the eldest vanish'd, and could
not be found, notwithstanding all the diligence <hi>Lizungzo</hi> used to get some account of
him.</p>
                     <p>I shall forbear giving a relation of all the executions which this barbarous person or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in the City, where he put all the Officers to death; only this I cannot omit, that,
among others Persons of Quality, there was an ancient man named <hi>Vs,</hi> whose Son com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the <hi>Chinese</hi> Army upon the Frontiers of <hi>Leaotung. Lizungzo</hi> sent order to this

to his King; and that if he had so base a Soul as to advise him to be a Traitor, he, for his

part of the Rear-guard, and had the Plunder of some part of the Baggage, in which were
all the Riches which the Emperours of <hi>China,</hi> of the House of <hi>Tayming,</hi> had been two
hundred and eighty years getting together.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> would not cross the River, as well because they would secure the Conquest
of the Province of <hi>Peking,</hi> as for that they were without any Prince, ever since the death
of <hi>Zungte,</hi> who died when the Army began to march out of the Province of <hi>Leaotung.</hi>
He had left only one Son, about six years of age, whom he had recommended to the tuition
of the eldest of his three Brethren, who proved so faithful to his trust, that the <hi>Tartars</hi>
gave him the name of <hi>Amaban,</hi> that is, Father-King.</p>

that it was too soon to talk of any such thing as yet; that <hi>Lizungzo</hi> was still alive, and
might re-enter <hi>Peking,</hi> that there was a necessity of ruining him, so as that it should be

                     <p>As soon as the <hi>Tartars</hi> were intreated by <hi>Vsanguei</hi> to come into <hi>China,</hi> they sent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite

to be called <hi>Taicing;</hi> and they say, that young Prince made so sensible a discourse at his
inauguration, as very much startled those who heard it, and expected no such thing from
one so young.</p>
                     <p>The same day that these Ceremonies were performed at <hi>Peking,</hi>

                     <p>In the interim, the Southerly Provinces had raised a powerful Army, which they sent to

we said before. Upon the reduction of the Province of <hi>Fokien,</hi> they gave him the Title
of King, under the name of <hi>Pingnam,</hi> that is, <hi>Pacifier of the South,</hi> treating him highly,
and putting him in hopes, that they would leave him the command of the two Provinces
of <hi>Fokien</hi> and <hi>Quantung.</hi> But the Prince, who commanded the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Army in the
Province, being upon his departure towards the Court, <hi>Chincilung,</hi> who had left his Fleet

in the Haven of <hi>Focheu,</hi> desirous to accompany him to the place where he was to take
leave of all the Officers; the <hi>Tartar</hi> took his advantage of the opportunity, pressed him
to go along to <hi>Peking;</hi> and finding him unwilling to do it, secured him, and brought him
away by force; and had it not been for his Brothers, who were Masters of the Fleet, the
<hi>Tartars</hi> would have put him to death.</p>
                     <p>The other Army,<note place="margin">An Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour chosen in <hi>Quangsi</hi>

there, that it was forced to dislodge thence, and retreat into that of <hi>Quantung,</hi> into
which the Viceroy and Governour of the Province pursued them; and to give the greater
reputation to their designs, they created an Emperour of the Royal Progeny, who assum'd
the name of <hi>Iunglie.</hi> After their example, several other Provinces revolted, but all their
attempts only confirmed the settlement of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who after the death of <hi>Kiang,</hi>
Governour of the City of <hi>Taitung</hi> in the Province of <hi>Xansi,</hi> who took up Arms against
them in the year 1649. and their reduction of the City of <hi>Quangcheu,</hi> in the Province of
<hi>Quangsi,</hi> which was taken on the 24. of <hi>November,</hi> 1650. have been possess'd of that vast
Country, without any disturbance; rather through the cowardice of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> then by
the number of their own Souldiery; in as much as it is impossible for any Army, how nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
soever, to conquer so powerful a State as that of <hi>China;</hi> if the Inhabitants had
ever so little courage to defend themselves. <hi>Xunchi,</hi> the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Emperour of <hi>China,</hi>

TRAVELS
INTO THE
INDIES.</head>
                  <head>The Third Book.</head>
                  <p>WE gave the Reader an account in the precedent Book,<note place="margin">1639</note> how that the
calm, which staid our Ship in a manner in fight of the Island of <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
occasioned the digression we have made, wherein we have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the State of the <hi>Indies,</hi> even to the utmost extremities of
<hi>Asia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We continued at the Altitude of <hi>Ceylon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">FEBRV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARY.</note> till the 20. of <hi>February,</hi> at which time the
North-west-wind oblig'd us to take our course towards South-east. Taking the Latitude
about noon,<note place="margin">The Voyage continued.</note> we found we were two minutes beyond the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> Line. I asked the
Master of the Ship, what he thought of their opinion, who affirm, that being under the
Line, a man may discover both the Poles: but he made it appear to me, that it was an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and shewed me clearly, that the <hi>Artick</hi> Pole is not to be seen within six Degrees of
the Line, and that the <hi>Artartick</hi> cannot be perceiv'd, till a man comes to the eighth degree.
He shew'd me farther, that at eight or ten degrees of the Line, the wind seems to be as
changeable, as it is in our Seas on this side of it, inasmuch as that of the North-west reigns
there six months together; and that of the South-east blows there as constantly for the
other six moneths. So that such as go into the <hi>Indies,</hi> or come thence, may regulate their
Voyages accordingly.</p>
                  <p>In these parts we saw several sorts of Birds,<note place="margin">Several sorts of Birds.</note> whereof some were white, and not unlike
our Pidgeons, save that their Tails are longer and narrower. Others were of sundry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and somewhat like wild Ducks. But among others, we saw abundance of those
Birds which the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Garayos,</hi> or <hi>Rabos foreados,</hi> which are black and white, as
Mag-pies, but somewhat bigger, and have their Tails divided like a Taylors pair of Shears.
All these Birds live only by the Sea, and feed on a certain flying Fish, which to avoid the
pursuit of the <hi>Albocores, Bonitos,</hi> and <hi>Dorados,</hi> that continually prey upon them, fly into
the Air,<note place="margin">And Fish.</note> where they can abide no longer then while their wings are moist, and where they
are caught by these Birds; or if, for want of moisture, they fall back into the Sea, they are
devour'd by those Fishes. The <hi>Albocores</hi> are white all over, and have no Scales, no more
then the <hi>Bonitos.</hi> The former are much bigger then the latter, and have but one bone in
them, which comes from the Head to the Tail. Some of them are so large, that if we may
credit report, one, between five and six foot long, hath dined sixty Seamen; but the meat
of it being not very good, I conceive they were rather glutted then satisfied. The <hi>Dorado,</hi>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:47786:295"/>
which the <hi>English</hi> confound with the Dolphin, is much like a Salmon, but incomparably
more delicate, and hath smaller Scales.</p>
                  <p>We also took a certain Fish,<note place="margin">Marsoui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> which had a mouth like the snout of a Hog; the <hi>Portuguez</hi>
call it <hi>Tonina,</hi> and the <hi>French Marsouin,</hi> a name, which no doubt is deriv'd from the <hi>German</hi>
word, which signifies a Sea-hog. The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in the Relation of their first Voyage,
affirm, that out of curiosity they opened one of them, and that they found within it not
only flesh and fat, and the intrails after the same manner as those of a Hog, but also a young
Pig in the belly of it, which they cast into the Sea. They are seen alwayes many of them
together, and when the Sea is rough, they come near the Vessel, and grunt, as if they desired
shelter against the Storm they perceive coming, and whereof the Sea-men look upon them
as an infallible sign.</p>
                  <p>The Sea hath not a more dangerous Fish then those which the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Tuberones,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tuberones</note>
the <hi>Dutch, Hayes,</hi> and the <hi>English, Shark.</hi> It is a great Fish, and hath much ado to swim;
whence it comes, that many times, when the Sea is clam, it is seen floating above water.
It is never seen, but there are fastened to the head of it seven or eight other Fish, about the
bigness of a Herring, expecting to participate of what he takes. Above all things, they
love mans flesh, and there are many sad examples of it, in Sea-men, who have either lost
arms or other limbs, or have been devoured by them; for their teeth are as sharp and close
as those of a Saw. Their mouth is below the head, so that to take their prey, they lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their backs, and so catch it upwards. That we took had the heart in the head, and
lived a good while after it was taken out. They are not eaten, and are hunted only for
recreation, or to cleanse the Sea of them.</p>
                  <p>The Fish which the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Pesce puerco,</hi> and whereof there is abundance in these
Seas, is no bigger then a Bream, and is so called, only because it grunts like a Pig. There
are also about those parts great store of Tortoises, which lie on their backs, and commonly
sleep upon the water, when the weather is calm. The Sea-men, when they see them in that
posture, get near them, cast out a hook, which fastning in the shells, they draw them into the
Boat. Their meat is as delicate as Veal, and it is one of the greatest refreshments the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
meet with in these great and dangerous Voyages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> 21. We were at one degree and twenty minutes of the Line, the weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rainy and tempestuous, and continuing so much longer then we expected it should at
that place; for it is so unconstant there, and changes so of a sudden, that many times they
have hardly leisure to take in their Sails, to avoid the violence of the Winds, which the
<hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Travados,</hi> that is, Whirlewinds.</p>
                  <p>The 23. died one of our Seamen, who having got the Pox at <hi>Surat,</hi> neglected the taking
of timely Remedies for the cure of it.</p>
                  <p>The 24. being <hi>Sunday,</hi> the President treated all the Officers of the Ship, and among
other dishes, had the <hi>Biggel</hi> dressed, and some of the Country Fowl, which the Viceroy of
<hi>Goa</hi> had presented to him.</p>
                  <p>The 25. We were surprized by a Calm, which kept us in the same place all that day;
but the night following there rose a Tempest, that put us out of our course, which we
could not well have kept, had that not happened: in regard that having the Sun in the
Zenith, ever since the 22. we could not take the altitude, but only in the night, by the
Stars.</p>
                  <p>This inconvenience continued till the fifth of <hi>March,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">MARCH.</note> having had the twenty seventh and
twenty eighth of <hi>February,</hi> the wind at South-west, which put us in hope, we should soon
have the <hi>Manson</hi>-wind whereof we stood in need to bring us to the Cape of <hi>Good Hope.</hi>
But the continual changes of the Wind, and Tempests, which obliged the Sea-men to be
alwayes about the Masts, lest they should be surprized by the <hi>Travados,</hi> retarded our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
very much.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 5. We began to make our Observations by the Sun, and found we were at eight
degrees, six minutes Latitude. Our Ship was encompassed by a great number of all sorts
of Fish, which seem'd to be our protection against the Whales, by whom they were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 10. We were at ten degrees,<note place="margin">Very changeable weather near the Line.</note> fourteen minutes, the Wind at West, which turned
to a Storm that lasted ten hours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 12. and 13. We had a great Storm, accompanied with Lightning and Thunder.
But what we thought most strange, was that, though we were not come to the 13. degree,
yet we found nothing of the ordinary Wind of the season, which is commonly perceived
about the eight or ninth. For the South-wind, which blew constantly, not only retarded
the prosecution of our Voyage, but also forced us so much back Eastward, that we were in
in some fear, we might be constrain'd to return upon the Coast of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:47786:296"/>
                     <hi>March</hi> 15. The Wind changed, and came to the South, and at Night, we had it South-east;
so that not doubting but it was the <hi>Manson,</hi> we put out all the Sail we could, and
made two Leagues an hour, taking our course South-west. During the time the Wind was
thus fair for us, we saw a great number of Dolphins, which followed our Ship, and we took
as many of them as found us three good Meals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 20. We were surpriz'd by a Calm, which took off much of our courage; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
our store of fresh Water being somewhat low, at a time when we knew not what to
hope of our Voyage, we were forced to assign every Man his allowance; and to make it
last the longer, it was resolved, that for some dayes there should be no salt Meat eaten, but
that the Swine, and some other Creatures, whereof, having good store, some had died that
day upon the eating of Mustard-seed, should be kill'd and consum'd.</p>
                  <p>Being about this time at sixteen Degrees, we found that the Compass declined thirty
Minutes to the West, and it continued so to the four and twentieth Degree. But when the
Cape of <hi>Good Hope</hi> is once doubled, the Loadstone draws towards the Earth.</p>
                  <p>The 21. While we floated up and down, without so much as a breath of wind, our
Ship took fire, which might have proved to the ruine of us all.</p>
                  <p>The Butler, going to remove a Vat which he had filled with <hi>Aqus vitae,</hi> set it on fire;
whereat he was so startled, that he turned it out about the Cellar, where the fire took in
one of the great Vessels, and was going to set thirty more into a flame, ahd it not been time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevented with Coverlets. The Ship was so loaden with all sorts of Gums, and other fat
Drugs, that it would have been impossible to quench it, had there not been a care taken to
smother it, at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>After that day, we began to made use of the invention of drawing fresh Water out of the
Sea; but it was fit only to dress Meat withall, in regard it had so untoward a taste, that the
Sea-men would not take it for their ordinary drink.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 22. We made a good dayes sail by the help of the <hi>Manson,</hi> getting above two
Leagues an hour. The same Wind continued the 23. 24. and 25.</p>
                  <p>This last day, a Sea-man was whipt at the Main-mast, for offering to debauch two young
Boyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 26. The Wind continued still fair; but in regard we had some reason to fear
that in case the wind should fail us, as it was likely to do, we should be put to great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veinences
for want of fresh water, a Councel was call'd, at which it was resolv'd, that we
should indeavour to make for <hi>Maurice</hi> Island, and there take in fresh water. This resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
very much rejoyced the company. The same night, we discovered the Island called
<hi>Diego Roiz,</hi> or <hi>Diego Rodriguez,</hi> at twenty degrees, forty five minutes, in so much
that we were in hopes the next day to reach <hi>Maurice</hi> Island, as being but sixty Leagues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>This Island,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Maurice</hi> Island de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> which the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Ilha do Cerno,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> have named <hi>Maurice,</hi>
Island, from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who was Admiral of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> at the time
of their first Voyage into the <hi>Indies,</hi> lies at 20. degrees, 27. minutes, and is abour 15. leagues
in compass.</p>
                  <p>The Haven of it is very good,<note place="margin">Its Haven.</note> as well in regard, that at the entrance of it there is a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
fathom water, as that it is able to contain above fifty great Vessels, sheltred from all
winds. It hath some Mountains, which reaching up to the Clouds are seen at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and are extreamly delightful to the eye, in as much as Nature maintains them in a
constant verdure, though some <hi>Cocos</hi>-trees, and Date-trees, only excepted, all the other
Trees are wild.</p>
                  <p>In the Vallies there are some Fruit-trees,<note place="margin">And offords the best Ebony.</note> but such as bear no Fruit are not the less esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for that, for these are they which yield the fairest Ebony in all the East. Some o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as black as any Jet, and as smooth as Marble; but the yellow and red is of greater value
then the other, as being more rare.</p>
                  <p>There is, as well in the Rivers of it, as the Sea about it, such abundance of Fish,
that at one casting of the Net, as many may be taken, as will fill two or three Tun
falted.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> in their Relations affirm,<note place="margin">A prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.</note> that they took a Thornback, which found
all in the Ship two good Meals, and that they saw there Tortoyses so big, that four

may take them with his hand; and they are commonly killed with Cudgels, especially
the Turtles, whereof there is such abundance, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> in less then two hours, took
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47786:296"/>
above a hundred and fifty, and might have taken more, if they could have carried them.
There is also great store of Herons, and a kind of Birds, of the bigness of a Swan, which
have neither Wings nor Tail, but so hard a flesh, that no heat can either boyl or roast it.
There is no four-footed Creature in all the Island:<note place="margin">No four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed Beasts.</note> but for other refreshments, and
particularly, for the taking in of fresh water, there is not a fitter place any way near
it.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Dutch</hi> came thither in <hi>September,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A <hi>French</hi> man lived 20. moneths in <hi>Maurice</hi> Island.</note> 1601. they found there a <hi>French</hi> Souldier,
who had left his Country some three years before, with three <hi>English</hi> Ships, which were
the first in those parts that attempted failing into the <hi>Indies</hi> upon the account of Pyracy.
Of these three Ships, one was cast away near the Cape of <hi>Good hope,</hi> and sickness having
consumed most of the men, they that remained set fire on the second, in regard for want of
men, they were not able to govern it. The third was wrack'd upon the Coasts of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> where all the men were lost, seven only excepted, to wit, four <hi>English</hi> men, two <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi>
and a <hi>French</hi> Souldier, who attempted to return with some booty, which they dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into a <hi>Cannow,</hi> wherein they set to Sea, and made a shift to get to <hi>Maurice</hi> Island.
The two <hi>Negroes</hi> had a design there to rid themselves of their Camerades, but being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
they cast themselves into the Sea, and were drowned. The four <hi>English</hi> men
would prosecute their Voyage, but the <hi>French Souldier</hi> chose rather to continue in the Isle,
then double the Cape, and expose himself to the mercy of the Sea, in so small a Vessel.
Accordingly, of the <hi>English</hi> men there was no more news heard. The <hi>French</hi> man had
been twenty moneths in the Island, when the <hi>Dutch</hi> came thither. He was stark naked,
in regard that having been in a burning Feaver, which heightned into a degree of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he had torn his clothes; so that having not had any thing about him ever since his
sickness, nor fed on any thing but the raw Tortoyses he took, they were not a little sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at the sight of him, and conceived it would be no easie matter to restore him to
his Senses, though he behaved himself well enough otherwise, and was in very good
health.</p>

fair, as it then was, we might in that time reach the Cape of <hi>Good hope,</hi> and so avoid
the inconveniences of wintering in the Island of <hi>Madagascar;</hi> whereupon it was resolved
we should prosecute our Voyage, which we did, and the same day got out of sight of

                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 29. After Sermon, the President acquainted all the men with the reasons which
had obliged him to change his resolution of taking in Water at <hi>Mourice</hi> Island, and made
it appear, that if they had gone to refresh themselves in the Island, they must have lost the
convenience of the Wind, and the fairest Season of the year, and so the means of finishing
their Voyage; exhorting all to take courage, and execute his Orders, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

                  <p>

                     <hi>April</hi> 5. We had but little Wind, and in regard the Compass still varied and declined,
we took our course towards the West, instead of taking it to the South, as we should other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have done. In these two days we made 73. Leagues.</p>
                  <p>The next day we were at 30. degrees Latitude.</p>
                  <p>The 7. We began to perceive, that we should not long enioy the good Wind had attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us some dayes before. Accordingly, the next day, we had a great calm, at 32. degrees
Latitude.</p>
                  <p>The 9. The Wind rising again, put us into some confidence, that within a few dayes
we should reach the Cape of <hi>Good hope,</hi> from which we could not be above three hundred
Leagues distant.</p>

From that day to the 14. we still advanced somewhat. That being <hi>Easter</hi> day, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
made a great Entertainment, whereof all in the Ship participated.</p>
                  <p>The 15. The North-west-wind grew to a great Tempest,<note place="margin">Pintados, a Bird disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Land.</p>
                  <p>The Tempest ceased with the morning of the 16th, and our Sea-men persisted in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we were near the Coast, in regard many Birds were seen about the Ship.</p>
                  <p>The 17. Towards night, there blew a fresh Gale of wind: but the next day, and the
night following, we had no wind at all, yet was the Sea as rough as it proved to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in the Tempest, which surpriz'd us the 19. at night, with the South-west wind, at
35. degrees Latitude. We took in all our Sails, and let down the Yards, preparing our
selves by that means against the Tempests, which are very frequent, and in a manner una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable,
about the Cape of <hi>Good hope,</hi> and we hover'd up and down in that posture all the
next day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 20. We perceiv'd that the Water was somewhat more whitish then it is in the
main Sea,<note place="margin">

and are a kind of Sea Mews, being white all over the bodies, and having black wings. They
have also this in particular, that in their flight they beat their wings one against the other,
whereas the common Sea-Mews seldom do it, but glide through the Air in an uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and even flight. It is observed, that where these Birds are seen, there is ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a hundred, or hundred and fifty fathom at most. Accordingly upon trial, we found it
at eighty fathom. We saw also the same day, a sort of Black-birds, that had only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the infallible fore-runners of a great Tempest.</p>
                  <p>The same day, we had one, with the West-north-west wind, which on the 24. turn'd to
a North-west. During that time we were forc'd to go before the Wind, the Water coming
into the Ship with such violence, that it took off our Carpenter; but he was so fortunate,
as to lay hold on a Rope was cast him, by which he was got aboard again. We found
ground at eighty fathom,<note place="margin">The Cape of <hi>Agul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has.</hi>

we inferred thence, that we were not far from the <hi>Cap d' Agulhas,</hi> which is sixty Leagues

                  </p>
                  <p>The 15. The Tempest increased so, that we began to despair of escaping, in regard the
current of the Sea forced us towards the Coasts, where we had inevitably been wrack'd, if
it had continued. We were at thirty six degrees, twenty minutes beyond the Line; and
this day we had like to have been destroyed by fire, occasioned by a Lamp in the Presidents
Chamber: but it was soon put out.</p>
                  <p>The Storm continued all the next day.<note place="margin">Fish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

those Fish called <hi>Pesce Puercos,</hi> would thence perswade us, that it would not be long ere the

came. Accordingly, about two in the afternoon, the Wind came to the North-west, and
the Tempest ceased, so that we could spread our Sails.</p>
                  <p>The 27. We had no Wind at all, but in the afternoon, it came to the North-west, which
obliged us to take our Course to the North-north-west, failing two Leagues an hour. We
saw that day a great number of <hi>Trombas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Trombas.</note> from which we inferred we were not far from the
Cape of <hi>Good hope.</hi> These <hi>Yrombas</hi> are a kind of great Canes, about the bigness of a mans
arm, and three or four foot long, which flote upon the water with their roots, as if the Sea
had forced them away from the neighbouring Coast; yet can it not be said whence they
come, nor that they are seen any where but about that <hi>Cape.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 28. We discovered the Coast, which before us reach'd from North to West. Some
thought at first it was <hi>Gabo-Falso,</hi> or the Cape of <hi>Good hope;</hi> but finding ground at forty
Fathom, and at thirty four degrees, forty minutes, they were soon convinced, that it was
the <hi>Cap d' Agulhas,</hi> whence it came that we went all that day laveering with a North-west
wind.</p>
                  <p>The 29. The Wind came to the South-east, so that we continued our course to the
North-west, keeping still in sight of the Land. That day we took as many Fith as found
the whole company two or three good meals. The night following the Wind changed,
and came to the North-west, obliging us to laveer; but being in a manner directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
we advanced but little. Taking the Altitude of the Sun that day, we found our selves
at 34. degrees, 27. minutes, and consequently, that we wanted 24. Leagues of being at the
Altitude of <hi>Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>May</hi> 1. The wind coming to the North-east by East, we kept along the Coast, and
perceived a very high shore,<note place="margin">MAY.</note> which was at last known to be <hi>Cabo Falso,</hi> which is
within seven Leagues of that of <hi>Good hope.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cabo Falso</note> It is called <hi>Cabo Falso,</hi> because it is seen at
a great distance, extending it self into the Sea much after the same manner as the other,
though it be not so high.</p>

                     </note> but turning
immediately to the North-west, we could not possibly enter the Bay, which obliged us to
make off the Coast, and get into the main Sea, taking our course towards the South.</p>
                  <p>The next day, with a North-west wind, we had a great tempest, which yet hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
us not from getting somewhat nearer the Coast. That day we cast one of our Sea
men over-board, with the ordinary Ceremonies used at funerals upon such occasions.
This was the third man died out of our Ship, since our departure from <hi>Goa.</hi>

                     <hi>May</hi> 4. We doubled one of the points of the Cape of <hi>Good hope,</hi> which is about
ten Leagues distant from the Road or Bay, and much about the same time we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Mountain, which the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in the year 1601. named the <hi>Tafelherg,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flat and square at the top like a Table. It was our intention to get into the
Bay, which is at the foot of the Mountain, and at 34. Degrees, four Minutes, within
fifteen Leagues of the Cape; but the wind being contrary, obliged us to keep along the
Coast, endeavouring to make the best advantage we could of it.</p>
                  <p>The 5. At Sun-rising, we were out of sight of Land; whereupon we changed our
course, taking it North-east, and turning the prow of the Ship towards the Coast, which
we discovered about noon. About two in the afternoon, we passed in sight of the
Island called <hi>St. Elizabeth,</hi> which is inhabited, and at night we got into the Bay, and cast
anchor at seven fathom water.</p>

of the Bay that day, but the contrary wind would not permit us. The next day, we sent
our Boat to bring aboard us fifteen persons, to wit, four men, eight women, and three
children, to be transported into the Island of <hi>Pingui,</hi> which is at the entrance of the Bay,
where those poor people were in hopes to live more at their ease upon the Carcasses of
Whales, which the Sea is wont to cast ashore there, and to be free from the persecutions
of the <hi>Soltanimans.</hi> The Boat returned in the Evening, loaden with all sorts of Birds,
especially <hi>Pinguins,</hi> which had been all kill'd with sticks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 12. Being Sunday, we weighed Anchor before day, and got out of the Bay
with a North-east Wind, taking our course Westward. The next day it came to North-north-east,
and afterwards to the North, and in the afternoon, we had not any at all: So
that we continued all the remainder of the day in sight of the coast. At night it came to
the South, but in less then two hours, it returned again to the North, and about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
we had such a Tempest, that we were forc'd to take in all our Sails.</p>
                  <p>The 17. The Tempest which had continued ever-since the 12. grew so high, that had
not our Ship been very sound, and of great burthen, it could not possibly have resisted
the violence of the winds and waves, which so covered it sometimes, that all upon the
Deck were wet to the skin.</p>
                  <p>The next day the Skie cleared up, and the wind was something allayed, but still
contrary. We took the elevation, and sound our selves, at 34. Degrees, 40. Minutes;
whence we concluded, that we were between <hi>Cabo Falso,</hi> and the Cape of <hi>Good hope,</hi> and
consequently, that the Wind had forc'd us back 25. or 30. Leagues, yet in the evening
we had in a manner recover'd what we had lost; but the night following, the wind was
so violent, as if the Elements had been near their resolution into their first Chaos.</p>
                  <p>These extraordinary winds are called <hi>Hurricans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hurricans.</note> and they come not with such fury, but
once in seven years, though the Sea in those parts be ordinarily tempestuous. We lost
in that tempest two of our best Sea men, who fell from the Scnttle into the Sea, where
one was immediately swallowed up; the other had so much strength as to lay hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
the rope was cast out to him, and got into the Ship; but falling on the sides of the Ship
he had so bruised himself, that he died within an hour after. The contrary wind forced
us into the main Sea, and reduc'd us to such extremities, that we were not so much
concern'd in the prosecution of our Voyage, as the saving of our lives; in as much as
had the Sea made the least breach in the Ship, it had been impossible for us to
escape.</p>
                  <p>The next day, the contrary wind continuing in the same violence, we were still in the
same danger, having no other hope, but what the next change of the Moon gave us.
But though she appeared the next day above the Horizon, yet the tempest was nothing
abated, till the rain somewhat allay'd the wind the 22. so that we could make use of our
sails, indeavouring to keep our course Westward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 23. VVe had a calm, during which the Ship stirr'd not from the same place.
VVe discovered the Coast North-east of us; and in regard we were then at 37, Degrees,
six Minutes, we imagined our selves to be in the same Altitude with the Coast which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47786:298"/>
lies between <hi>Cabo Palso,</hi> and that of <hi>Agulhas.</hi> In the evening the wind increased, and
brought with it a tempest, from the West-north-west, which forc'd us to put off from the
Coast.</p>
                  <p>The 24. The wind continued strll contrary, and in the evening there rose such a
tempest, as forced us to go all night before the wind.</p>
                  <p>The 25. We resum'd our course with a West wind, taking it South-west. We
were that day at 36. Degrees Latitude.</p>
                  <p>The 26. With the Sun-rising, we had the North-east wind, which made us put out
all our Sails, taking our course West, and sayling after the rate of two Leagues an hour.
But in the evening, the wind turned to the North-west, with so great likelyhood of a
tempest, that it was thought fit to take in part of our Sails. Accordingly, the wind
increased so by degrees, that we were forc'd to take in all but the main Sail, which
was not taken in till the wind grew so violent, as if it would have confounded all the
Elements, to have swallowed us up in the disorder. Nay, its fury was such, that our
Ship which had resisted all before, as a Rock, was tossed by the waves like a little boat.
I must confess it was through Gods infinite mercy to us, that we escaped that danger,
wherein we were in all likelihood, to perish, since it was a kind of Miracle, that the Masts
stood, considering the violence of the winds was such, as might have rooted up the
strongest Trees. This dreadfull Tempest continued the 28. and 29. with so little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission,
that we began to despair of prosecuting our Voyage, inasmuch as the first quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Moon had brought no change of weather: whereupon it was taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
whether it were not our safest course to go and pass over the Winter in the
Island of <hi>Madagascar.</hi> It was urged, that the Ship, having been much batter'd by
the waves, would not be able to hold out much longer, and that though it should,
our provisions would not, and so it would be impossible for us to compleat our Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
This proposal was generally approved; but when it was considered on the other
side, that that delay, which must have been at least six moneths, would be an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
equal to the imminent danger we were in, it was thought the best course to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
the Voyage.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>May</hi> 30. The President having called all the Officers together, and represented to
them the condition of the Ship, and the little likelihood there was of compleating the
Voyage; Nay, on the contrary, that the wind might be more violent, as the Moon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
and that coming in <hi>September,</hi> or <hi>October</hi> upon the Coasts of <hi>England,</hi> the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would be as great as that they were then in upon those of <hi>Africk,</hi> it was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that to preserve the Ship, we should put into the Island of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> and stay
there till <hi>September,</hi> inasmuch as within that time there would come thither some <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Vessels, which might supply us with things necessary for the prosecution of our
Voyage.</p>
                  <p>According to this resolution, we tack'd about at two in the afternoon, the weather
so tempestuous, that we could beat but two Sails. We saild two Leagues an hour,
but the Sea was so rough, that many times the waves came over the Ship. This
tempest continued till the next day, but about noon it ceased.</p>

resolution, and set things in order to our return to the Cape of <hi>Good hope,</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,

                  </p>
                  <p>The same wind continued the third of <hi>Iune,</hi> insomuch that about noon, we were got
to 35. Degrees, 8. Minutes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iune</hi> 4. VVe saw abundance of the <hi>Manga's de Valudo,</hi> but the wind changed, so that
we had much ado to keep on our course to South-south-west, and afterwards to North-north-west
towards the Coast. VVe saw also abundance of <hi>Trombas,</hi> whence we inferred
we were not far from the Cape of <hi>Good hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 6. VVe had no wind at all, so that we spent the day in fishing. We found
sometimes, 43. and 48. sometimes 54. and 63. fathome water. Towards night, we had
a good North-west wind.</p>
                  <p>The 7. The wind came to West; and at night we had so great a tempest, that
we were forc'd to take in all our Sails.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iune</hi> 8. The Tempest continuing with the same violence, we could advance but little.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47786:299"/>
About midnight, it came North, and we took our course Northwest.</p>
                  <p>The 9. The wind ceased, and having taken the Altitude, we were at 35 Degrees,
30. Minutes. In the afternoon we had a North-west wind, with a dreadful Tempest,
which forced us to take in all our Sails, and go before the wind, in some danger of
running upon the coast. This was the saddest night we had in all our Voyage. For the
Master of the Ship fearing the reproaches of his superiours, if he came not to <hi>England</hi>
within the year, endeavoured all he could to prosecute the Voyage; but finding at
last, all was to no purpose, he acknowledged there was no other way to save the Ship
and the persons in it, but to put in somewhere. Whereupon it was immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
we should go and winter in <hi>Madagascar;</hi> and so we presently changed our course.</p>
                  <p>The 11. The weather was fair; but about midnight the sky was so overcast, that it
was not doubted but a Tempest was coming, as indeed it did, and continued the three
next dayes.</p>
                  <p>The 15. It ceased, and the wind being VVest-north-west, we took our course to
the North-east, and in 24. hours, got 33. Leagues.</p>
                  <p>The 16. We got 44 Leagues. The 17th. 50. with an East-south-east wind, taking our
course to the North-east.</p>
                  <p>The 18. VVe got 30. with a VVest-South-west wind; the 19th. 40. and the 20th.
having failed 30. Leagues, we were at 31. Degrees 15. Minutes Latitude.</p>
                  <p>The 23. At break of day, we discovered a Vessel, which soon came up to us. It
was a Ship belonging to the new Company, of 500. Tun burthen, and came out of
<hi>England</hi> some four moneths before, under the command of Captain <hi>Hall,</hi> who being
sick, and not able to stir, sent to the President to desire him he would honour him so
far as to come aboard his Vessel, which he did, taking along with him the Physitian
and my self. He not only treated us kindly, but also proffer'd to supply us with
Cordage and Sails, in case we met not with any Vessels of the old Company at <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gascar:</hi>
whither it was resolved they should make all the haste they could; Captain

same Company, one whereof was upon her return for <hi>England;</hi> the other bound for
the <hi>Indies.</hi> It was but three months since the latter came from <hi>England;</hi> commanded
by Captain <hi>Willis,</hi> being 1400. Tun burthen. Her name was the <hi>London,</hi> and she was
one of the noblest Vessels I ever saw. The Captain came immediately aboard us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by a young Merchant, and proffer'd the President to supply him with all
things necessary for the prosecution of his Voyage.</p>
                  <p>The 3. The Officers of all the three ships had a meeting aboard ours, to consider
what course they should take with the Inhabitants, that they might not hold their
provisions at too dear a rate; and it was resolved, that what ever were bought should
be bought upon a common account; and to that end, every one should bring out the
commodities they were willing to truck, which should be put off by the Secretaries of the
three Ships.</p>
                  <p>The Glass-bracelets, beads and Agats, we had brought from the <hi>Indies</hi> were incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably

                     </note> out of <hi>Europe;</hi> so that it was resolved ours
should not be produced, till the others were sold. By this means, we bought every
day four Oxen for forty pair of Glass-bracelets, which the Inhabitants call <hi>Rangus;</hi> a
Sheep for two, and a Calf for three <hi>Rangus;</hi> and for a brass ring, ten or twelve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
about, a man might have an Oxe worth here six or seven pound.</p>
                  <p>The 4. The President, Captain <hi>Willis,</hi> and Captain <hi>Hall,</hi> went up the River to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Countrey, and to see what Cattle was brought down to the Bay. We found neer
Captain <hi>Willis</hi>'s Tent about thirty men, and some women, who had brought milk to
sell. They had brought also about twenty Oxen, Sheep, and Goats: but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was a greater number coming after them, we provided our selves only for three
dayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:47786:299"/>
The 6. The President invited the two Captains and all the Officers of both the other
Ships to dinner; and some dayes after Captain <hi>Willis</hi> treated the whole Company. In the
afternoon he entertain'd us with a Comedy, which lasted above three hours.</p>
                  <p>The 14. Captain <hi>Hall</hi> went on his Voyage towards the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the 16. Captain <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
went away also, having supplied us with all things necessary for the prosecution of ours.
He intended to touch at the <hi>Maldives,</hi> and stay there till the 20. of <hi>August,</hi> that he might
arrive at <hi>Surat</hi> in the Winter. We accompanied him to the Island, at the entrance of the
Bay, and having taken leave of him, went into the Island, where we found abundance of
odd Shells of divers forms, several sorts of Fish cast up there by the Sea, and rotted Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos,
which the Wind had forced thither from the Eastern Coast of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> where some
grows, but not from the Coast of the Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> Bay, which is opposite to the
West.</p>
                  <p>The 21. The President took up his Lodging in the Tent pitched for him on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
intending to continue there, till he imbark'd in order to our return. They made
there also certain Huts, for the Souldiers that were about him, as also for such as were
repairing some things belonging to the Ship, and for the Butchers, who kill'd and salted
the Beef for the Provision of the Ship: but on Sundayes all came aboard, where there
was a Sermon.</p>
                  <p>About four Leagues from the Haven,<note place="margin">The Lord of those parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> there lives a Lord, who had three Sons, the eldest
of whom was named <hi>Massar.</hi> They came all three to see us, with a retinue of about a
hundred men, arm'd with a kind of Pikes. They brought along with them about three
hundred Oxen, some Sheep, Goats, Poultry, Citrons, and Oranges, to truck for our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.
Being come near the President, they made a little halt, to observe what posture
we were in, and at last the eldest of the three Brothers came up, and bestowed on the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
twelve Goats, and his two Wives gave him, each of them, a fat Capon. The Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
presented him with three Strings of Glass Coral, each of his Brothers with two, and
each of the Wives with a Bracelet. This signified but very little to us; but they highly
valued them.<note place="margin">Makes an alliance with the <hi>English.</hi>
                     </note> They planted a great Pole in the ground, as a mark of the Alliance they
made with us, promising severely to punish such as should injure us, and desiring us to take
such a course, as no disorder might happen on our side. They desired to hear our Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
and seem'd to be much pleased with it. They sold us ten fat Oxen, some Sheep,
Goats and Poultry. They sold us a fat Sheep, the Tail whereof weighed twenty or
twenty four pound for seven or eight grains of Coral or Agat, and a Capon for three or
four grains of counterfeit Coral. They would not meddle with our money, as being so
happy as not to know the value of a thing which occasions the misery of other parts of
the World.</p>
                  <p>During the six weeks we staid in the Island, most of our diversion was shooting at Buts,
or fishing with the Angle-rod. We took good store of Fish, and some Oysters, which the
Inhabitants call <hi>Oring.</hi> These stick to the Trees and Bushes that are upon the Sea-side,
being at high-water cover'd with the Tide. They are large, and as delicate as any <hi>England</hi>
affords.</p>

                     <note place="margin">AVGVST</note> there were such abundance of Grashoppers, that

Water in the World. Some of them are covered with a kind of Trees, the Wood whereof
is of all sorts of colours, (but especially, such as afford Ebony, and a certain Wood, which
in colour comes near that of Brasil, whereof they make their Lances or Pikes) and Date-trees,
which gives shelter to an infinite number of Apes and Birds, and among others, a
kind of Hens, as big as Turkies, save that they were black all over the body, but marked
with little white spots. Their heads are between a red and blew colour, and in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
they have a yellow horn. They feed in the Woods whole hundreds of them together.</p>

There is also great store of that Gum, which the Druggists call <hi>Dragons-bloud,</hi> which
is drawn out of the flower of a Tree,<note place="margin">Dragons-bloud.</note> about the bigness of a Pear-tree, but much more
branchy, and not so full of leaves. Its leaves are longer, but narrower then those of
Lawrel, and the flower is taken off in order to the extracting of the juyce, and put

                  <p>Their greatest wealth consists in Cattel.<note place="margin">The Island rich in Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</note> For where they do till the ground, it is only
to get a little Rice, which is excellent good there, as also for Beans, Pompions, and that kind

Wax, nor using their Honey, otherwise then in making a certain Drink of it with
Rice, which serves them instead of Wine. The ground yields Salt, and Saltpeter, and upon
the Sea-coasts there is found abundance of Ambergreece. It is reported also, that there
are mines of Gold and Silver; but the Inhabitants making no use of these Metals, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing

down to the Knee before, and the other to the Ham behind, and in the night they take it
off, and make it serve for a Coverlet. They lie upon Mats, and in regard their Huts are

of several colours, and several Bracelets of them about their Necks, their Arms, or
above the Elbow, and about their Legs under the gartering place. Both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have their Ears bored through, and put into them Copper Rings, somewhat like, but
not so large as those they wear about their Wrists, and the small of the Leg. Their
Hair is black, but not equally curled all over the Country, and they dispose it into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
tresses, but it grows not much, though they grease it perpetually, and do all they
can to get long Hair. There is little difference between the clothing of the Men, and
that of the Women, save that the Women wear also a kind of sleeveless long Coat, and
that the Cloth wherewith they cover themselves is so large, that it hides all their Thighs
almost down to the Knee. In this Cloth they carry their Children upon their Backs, so
as that putting their Legs under the Mothers Arms, they seem to be in a manner fastned
together, and yet as she carries them, a Man would think, they should fall backwards, and
break their back-bones.</p>
                  <p>The fidelity of Wives towards their Husbands is here exemplary, and the Men think it
no disparagement to take their advice. No Man but hath at least two Wives, but dispos'd
into several Huts. For the more aged of the two he hath most compliance, though he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
no business, nor concludes any bargain, till he hath consulted both. These they
buy of their Parents, or rather Relations, for a certain number of Oxen, Pikes, or other
Arms. Adultery and Fornication is punished with death; but they do not easily suspect
one another. They are very free in their conversation, and there is no familiarity so great
as to raise any jealousie in them.</p>
                  <p>Some young Women made no difficulty to come into our Tent; nay, one of them made
not any to take one of my Shirts from the President, who intreated her to wear it for my
sake. She accordingly wore it two dayes, but afterwards tore it to pieces, to be used about
other things.</p>
                  <p>The Men are couragious,<note place="margin">The men are coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous.</note> and well skill'd in the use of their Lances, Darts, and Pikes,
which they carry along with them where ever they go. When they are at work, their
Arms lie not far from them, and they are accustomed to them from the eighth or ninth year
of their age.</p>
                  <p>Some Persons of Quality have a bundle of twenty five or thirty of these little Pikes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
after them.<note place="margin">Their Arms.</note> They use also Bows and Arrows, and their Bowes are at least five or six
foot long, the String being very loose, yet have they a sleight of shooting with a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
swiftness and strength. When they cast their Pikes or Javelings, they make several
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47786:300"/>
postures, and are so expert at this exercise, that at the distance of forty paces they will not
miss a bird.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Madagascar</hi> are divided into several Tribes,<note place="margin">Their Chief</note> which consist of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
of a 100. 200. and 300. persons, and live like <hi>Tartars,</hi> under a Chief, whom they

neer our Tent, where they had built them huts under Date-trees. VVhen their cattle
multiplies so as that the grass falls short, they engage in a kind of a war among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

These Princes have an absolute power over their Subjects, and severely punish the crimes
committed within their jurisdictions, especially such as tend to the disturbance of the
Publick peace: but this dignity is not so continued in the same Family, but that upon
the Prince's death, the strongest is advanced to this pretended Crown.</p>

they belive there is one God, who hath made Heaven and Earth; and will one

their Priest, getting up a tree, and speaking to the People, for above half an hour:
but not one of us understanding their Language, I know not what discourse he made to
them, nor yet what difference there is between their Priests and the others; save that I
observ'd, they carried at the end of a Cane a piece of a Cowes-tail, and that one of them

                     </note> in his History of the Life and Actions of <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
affirms, that when the <hi>Portuguez</hi> discovered the Island of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> in the year
1506. there came aboard their Ship as many Negroes as a boat could well carry. They
were kindly receiv'd, and had several little Presents made them; but they ill requited that
civility, for assoon as they were got into their own boat, they shot so many Arrows at the
<hi>Portuguez,</hi> that they were forc'd to answer them with Cannon and Musket-shot. The
same year another <hi>Portuguez</hi> Captain, named, <hi>Rodrigo Pereira,</hi> being cast by a tempest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Eastern Coast of this Island, he sent word to the Inhabitants, by an <hi>African Moor,</hi>
who understood somewhat of their Language, that the design of his coming thither, was
to enter into an alliance with them, and to settle an advantagious Commerce for both.
The Islanders seem'd to approve of this Proposal, and told the <hi>Moor,</hi> they would carry
him to their King, that he might conclude with him the Treaty desired by the <hi>Portuguez,</hi>
but being got off a little from the others, they fell upon him, and had kill'd him, had
they not discharg'd some Muskets at them, whereby some fell, and the rest were forc'd
to let go the <hi>Moor.</hi> The <hi>Portuguez</hi> Captain having got him again, landed at another
place, where he surprized the Inhabitants, and took their King Prisoner: but treated
him so well, that he proffer'd to bring them to a place, where they should find a good
Haven for their Ship. He brought the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Captain to a Bay, at the entrance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there was a very populous Island, whereat the Inhabitants were frightned, and fled
into the great Island, forsaking Wives and Children, nay even their King: so that it
proved no hard matter for the <hi>Portuguez</hi> to possess themselves of the Island; whence
they sent to the Inhabitants, Inviting them to return, and to permit their planting among
them, since they desired only their friendships. They returned, and presented the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
with 50. Oxen, and 20. Goats; but, to be rid of their Guests, they represented to
them, that there were greater advantages to be made in the Port of <hi>Matatana,</hi> inasmuch
as there they would find Silver and several Drugs to truck for. The Captain would have
gone thither, but the current of the Sea having forc'd one of his Ships upon the Coast,
he retired with the other to the Island of <hi>Mozambique.</hi> The same Tempest which had
cast that Captain upon the Eastern Coast of the Island, forc'd another Ship of the
same Fleet into the Port of <hi>Matatana,</hi> whither there presently came one of the boats

he had made upon the Coasts of <hi>Africk,</hi> and learnt the Language of the Countrey. The
<hi>Negroes</hi> having him in their boat, made all the haste they could ashore, which obliged the
<hi>Portuguez</hi> to put out their shallop, with fourscore men in it, to overtake them; but the
<hi>Negroes</hi> were too quick for them, and carried away the man. The Shallop coming near

                     </hi> saw their Master, who told them he had been brought to their King,
and civilly received by him, and that he was desirous to speak with the Captain, and
enter into friendship with him. The Captain made no difficulty to go ashore, where the
King received him kindly, and treated him magnificently, according to the custom of the
Country: but thinking to return in the Evening, there rose so great a tempest, that it was
impossible for him to get aboard. The tempest continued four dayes, so that those who
were in the Ship, believed that their Captain had been kill'd by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Anchor, and returned to <hi>Mozambique.</hi> The Captain finding the Ship gone, and that
there was little likelihood of ever getting out of the Island, grew so discontented that
he died of it. Eight other Persons of his retinue died also, and they who remained em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
in the Shallop, choosing rather to expose themselves to the uncertain event of a
dangerous Navigation, then stay in a place where they must perish within a few days;
and they were so happy as to meet with a Vessel commanded by the Captain <hi>Iohn
Fonseca,</hi> who received them aboard, and carried them into <hi>Africk.</hi>

knowledge of the disease called the Scurvy, and the remedies now used for the
cure of it, that most of their men being not able to perform their labour, they were
forced to touch there in order to some relief for their diseased: but ere they could

last relations have in particular, is, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Madagascar</hi> are circumcised,
though there be nothing otherwise that evinces them to be <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> since they have
no <hi>Mosques,</hi> nor any exercise of Religion, nor appearance of Devotion in all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour.</p>
                  <p>Having passed over the Winter on the other side of the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> Line, we began to
set things in order for the prosecution of our Voyage, and bought the 19. of <hi>August,</hi> of
King <hi>Masiar,</hi> and two other neighbouring Princes, <hi>Tsebich Tanga,</hi> and <hi>Andiam Palola,</hi>
twenty five fat Oxen more, and about a hundred Sheep and Goats, besides the hundred and
fifty Oxen we had bought during our aboad in the Island, all which we put aboard the
20. that we might not want fresh meat during our Voyage. The same day we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
our baggage, and the next day we got out of the Bay of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and left
the Island of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> with a South-west wind, which continuing all the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
we soon got out of sight of the Island.</p>
                  <p>The 22. The <hi>Manson,</hi> which we could not yet have hoped for, came unexpectedly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, and advanced our progress very much, taking our course to West-south-west.</p>
                  <p>The 23. The wind came to the East, so that having it full behind us, we went on mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
taking our course the more towards the South, to avoid the Cape of <hi>Good hope,</hi> where
we intended not to touch at all.</p>
                  <p>The 24. and 25. the wind was somewhat abated; but the 26. it blew so fresh a gale,
that we made a great progress. We were that day at 27. degrees, 27. minutes Latitude;
and the 28th. at 28. degrees, 12. minutes.</p>
                  <p>The 29. We had the wind East-south-east, with those storms which the <hi>Portuguez</hi>
call <hi>Travados:</hi> They were immediately over. We saw that day, being at 31. degrees,
15. minutes Latitude, a great number of the Fishes called <hi>Pesce puercos,</hi> which leaped
three or four foot above water, as if it had been their design to find us sport. The next
day we had a Tempest, yet such as hindered not our getting somewhat forward; so that the
last of <hi>August,</hi> we were at 33. degree, 34. minutes.</p>

                     <hi>September</hi> the first,<note place="margin">SEPTEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BER.</note> the wind grew so violent, that we were forc'd to take in part of our

the wind being South-west.</p>
                  <p>The 3. The Sea being very calm, we kill'd one of the Cowes we had bought in <hi>Madagascar,</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:47786:301"/>
and found three Calves in the belly of it; as also a Goat, that had four young Kids with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it; from which a man may judge of the fruitfulness of the Country.</p>
                  <p>At night we saw up and down certain Lights, like flames; but we could not judge
whether they were the Fishes, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Dorad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there appear'd two, they were called <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux, Dioscures,</hi> and <hi>Tyndarides,</hi> and
when but one, it was called <hi>Helene.</hi> Some have not shaken off the superstition of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that their fire presages a Tempest. But, on the contrary, we had a great calm, the
next day, and saw infinite multitudes of little Sea-birds. About two in the afternoon,
we had a North-east wind, which continuing fair all the next day, we failed above two
Leagues an hour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>September</hi> 6. We had a great tempest; It continued all night, and shook the Ship so,
that the water coming in at several places, we were forc'd to pump four times an hour.
The same day we came 35. degrees Latitude.</p>
                  <p>The 7. The weather was somewhat fair, so that we made use of our Sails, taking
our course West-north-west. The Sea was very rough, and forc'd us towards the Coast,
from which we thought our selves fourty Leagues distant, and from the Cape of <hi>Good
hope</hi> 130. The 8. and 9. the wind South, and it proved rainy weather.</p>
                  <p>The 10. We had but little wind, yet got 40 Leagues in 24 hours; we saw many of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas

                  </p>
                  <p>The 11. We made but a small progress, with an East wind. Casting the plummet,
and finding a sandy bottome, one hundred and twenty fathom water, we are confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the opinion we had before, of our being near Cape <hi>d' Agulhas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 12. The contrary wind forc'd us to laveering to the North-north-west, and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west,
going either further from, or neerer to the Coast, which yet they could not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
In the afternoon, we resumed our course to the West-north-west, with a South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
wind, and at night we found a yellowish sand, at 190. fathom water.</p>
                  <p>The 13. Our course was to the West-north-west, with a South-east wind. About 10.
we saw a dead Whale floating upon the water; and being then at 35. degree latitude,
we conceiv'd we might be at the altitude of the <hi>Cape of Good hope,</hi> where many of
these creatures are ordinarily seen.</p>
                  <p>The 14. we found at Sun-rising,<note place="margin">Declinat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to the East, whence we inferr'd, that we had compass'd the <hi>Cape of Good hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day, we had the wind so full a Stern, that had it been contrary, it would
have forc'd us once more to think of putting into some place, or at least put us to the same
extremities we had been in before near the Cape. We therefore found the declination of
the Load-stone to be one degree, fifty minutes, and presently after, the declination of it
near the <hi>Cape of Good hope,</hi> is four degrees, though otherwise it doth not decline so much.
Assoon as the <hi>Cape</hi> is past, the Compass still varies towards the East, in regard the
Needle draws to the Earth, where no doubt there is Iron, and other Load-stones that
draw it: but the declination on that Coast never exceeds eight degrees.</p>
                  <p>About 20. Leagues on this side the <hi>Cape of Good hope,</hi> and at 33. degrees, 15. minutes,
lies the Island of St. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

this place, a man may have at any time of the year, Figs, Pomegranats, Citrons and Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and there are Goats, Swine, <hi>Barbary</hi>-Hens, Feasants, Partridges, Quailes, Peacocks,
Pigeons, and great store of all sorts of Birds, as also salt for the keeping of them; so that
Ships might be sufficiently provided with all things, if they would stay there any time.
The Sea supplies it with more Fish then can be consumed; and the Earth brings forth
so many excellent Herbs, that the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> unwilling to retard their Voyage, leave at
this place their sick men, who recover their health within a few days, and having only
a little Oyl, Rice, Bisket and Spice, make a shift to live there till the Ships come thither
the next year. Its Mountains are so high, that they reach above the Clouds, and are
seen at Sea, at the distance of 14 Leagues. The Trees wherewith they are covered bring
forth no Fruit, and are fit only for firing, but the Valleys are extreamly pleasant. The
King of <hi>Portugal</hi> would not have any establishment to be made there upon these reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
that all Ships passing that way might find refreshment there, and that it would be
a hard matter to keep the said Island against all the other Nations, who are concerned in its
being still free, inasmuch as were it not for that, Vessels many times, would be forc'd upon
the Coasts of <hi>Guiny,</hi> where water is not to be had at all times, and where they should be
obliged to stay for Rain, which would be so great an inconvenience that many of
the men would in the mean time droop and die.</p>

The fertility of this Island proceeds chiefly from the daily rain which falls there: but
they are transient showrs soon over, so that the Sun shining presently after, and that by
intervals, it must needs very much advance the maturation of all things.</p>
                  <p>There are three places where fresh water may be taken in, to wit, where the three Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
which come out of the Mountain fall into the Sea. They breed abundance of Snakes;
but the <hi>Dutch</hi> eat them, and prefer them before Eels.</p>

                     </note> North-west of the Island of Saint <hi>Helene,</hi> is that of the <hi>Ascension,</hi>
so called by the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> upon its being discovered upon <hi>Ascention-day.</hi> It lies at 8.
degrees, 30. minutes South of the Line, and hath also very high mountains; but it affords
no fresh water, nor any other refreshment; nay, it hath not so much as any verdure; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what may be particularly said of it, is that upon the Coasts of it, there are more Fish
then upon those of Saint <hi>Helenes,</hi> which occasions the coming thither of abundance of
Birds, that live only upon the said Fish. These Birds are somewhat like Geese, at least
as the Relations describe them. Assoon as a Vessel comes near, there flie such numbers
thereof into it, that they are easily kill'd with sticks, but the meat of them is not good.
The Earth of its Mountains is of a reddish colour, much like that which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
call <hi>Almagro,</hi> from the name of a City, where there is much of it found.</p>

                  <p>The 13. The wind came to North-east, and helped us forward 25. Leagues to North-north-west,

44. Leagues.</p>
                  <p>The 16. The wind continued South-east, and we got 46. Leagues; we had that day the

                  <p>The 18. With the same wind, we got 42. Leagues, to the fifth degree of Latitude.
That day we saw Millions of flying fishes, and abundance of those birds the <hi>Portuguez</hi>

                  <p>The 19. With a South-east wind, we got 40. Leagues, and got to 3. Degrees, 19

                  <p>The 21. VVith the same wind, we got 35. Leagues, and passed under the <hi>Aequinoctial
Line.</hi> At one degree beyond the Line lies the <hi>Cape de Lope Gonsales,</hi> upon the Coasts of
<hi>Guiny,</hi> the Road whereof is very good. There Vessels take in refreshments, in case they
had not done it at Saint <hi>Helene's</hi> Island.</p>
                  <p>The Island of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Island.</note> so called by the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> from its being discovered on
21th. of <hi>December,</hi> lies under the Line. Though there be no talk of any Plague at
that place, yet is the air thereof very unwholsome, and prejudicial to strangers, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well bear the excessive heats predominant there; Whence it comes, there are few gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beards
seen there, and few <hi>Christians</hi> reach 50. years of Age, though the Inhabitants of
the Country live to above a hundred. Day and Night are of an equal length there all
the year long, and it rains only in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September:</hi> but all the remainder of the
year, the Earth is moistened by a certain Dew, which brings forth all sorts of fruits.
They who discovered the Island found it overgrown with a kind of trees, the branches
whereof were all streight. Heretofore there grew Sugar there, in such quantities, as that
there was enough to load thence yearly above forty Ships: but it is now sometime since
that there bred there a kind of Worms, which so gnaw the Canes, that the Island can
hardly furnish six Ships therewith. It affords much Wheat, and Wine, Millet, Rye, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
Melons, Cowcumbers, Figs, Ginger, red-Parsnips, Cabbages, Navews, Lettice, Parsly,
all sorts of Roots, Pulse, and Pot-herbs, and among others, a certain Root named <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naman,</hi>
accounted a very delicate dish by the Inhabitants. It is a kind of Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47786:303"/>
the rinde whereof is black, and the meat white, about the bigness, and not unlike
the <hi>French Navew,</hi> save that it casts forth several branches below. It is baked in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and tastes somewhat like, but much better then a great Chesnut. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
have planted Olive-trees there, as also Peach-trees, and Almond-trees, which grow well
enough, but bear no Fruit.</p>
                  <p>Among the living Creatures,<note place="margin">Land Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visses.</note> particularly to this Island, there is a kind of Crevisses, which
live within the ground, and work like Moles. There is also abundance of Partridges,
Quails, Black-birds, Parrats, and other Birds: but particularly great store of excellent fish,
especially VVhales, which are of a monstrous bulk, upon the Coasts of this Island.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of the Island, there is a Mountain covered with Trees, and over-spread
with a Cloud, which supplies it with fresh water, and that abundantly enough to water
the Sugar Canes: but what is most remarkable is, that the higher the Sun comes over the
Horizon, the more water falls from the said Cloud.</p>
                  <p>The natural Inhabitants of it are <hi>Negroes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</note> but Forreigners continue white to the third

                  <p>VVithin 35. Leagues of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Island,<note place="margin">Rolles-Island.</note> South-ward, there is another Island, which
the <hi>Portuguez.</hi> call <hi>Rolles Island.</hi> wherein there are Oranges, Citrons, <hi>Bananas, Ananas,</hi>
Ginger, Poultry, Swine, and other refreshments, in such plenty, that having besides a very

                  <p>The 24. VVe got but 22. Leagues, having continual thunder and lightning, which
lasted till night.</p>
                  <p>The 25. The same South-east wind carried us 32. Leagues, taking our course North-North-west;
The weather was rainy, with storms, and those winds which the <hi>Portuguez</hi>
call <hi>Travados,</hi> which are very ordinary towards the Coasts of <hi>Guiny,</hi> from which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
our selves to be then distant about 150. Leagues.</p>
                  <p>The 26. The wind continuing South-east, we got 25. Leagues, and were at seven
degrees Latitude. The heat was much greater here, then it had been on the other side of
the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> though the Sun were ten degrees further from our Hemisphere, in as
much as the Sun, which had so lately warmed the Septentrional Hemisphere, had not
yet had time to warm the Meridional.</p>
                  <p>The 27. The wind changed and came to North and by East, which obliged us to
change our course. We got that day but 13. Leagues, and about noon, were at seven
degrees, 50. minutes Latitude. And as we came further off from the Coasts of <hi>Guiny,</hi> we
accordingly removed out of the bad weather, which had much incommodated us before.</p>
                  <p>The 28. The wind came to North-east, which is ordinary in those parts within the
10th. and 20th. degrees, whereas from thence it changes, as it does on our Seas on this
side. We got that day 30. Leagues.</p>
                  <p>The 29. The same wind carried us 31. Leagues; and at noon, we were got to 10 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

They are in perpetual wars with their Neighbours, and are expert enough at the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of their Horses,<note place="margin">Their Arms</note> which are brought them out of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and very swift. Their
Arms are the Bow, and a kind of Lance or light Pike, which they handle very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.
The most illustrious marks of their Victories are the Privy parts, which having
cut off from their Enemies, they present them to their <hi>Wives,</hi> who dispose them into
Neck-laces, and account them a greater Ornament then Pearls.</p>
                  <p>They marry several <hi>Wives,</hi>

as at home, where the Husband is served up alone, with what his Wife hath provided
for him; and as soon as he hath din'd, he reassumes his Arms, and goes either a hunting, or
about his business. The Women are accustomed to such hardness, that as soon as they are
delivered, they go and wash the Child, either in the Sea, or the next River.</p>
                  <p>The Men are for the most part much subject to drunkenness,<note place="margin">The men drunkards.</note> and such lovers of Wine,
that some have been seen to take off a Bottle of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> at a draught. Their times of
debauches are, at the Funerals of their Friends, at which they spend four or five dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in weeping and drinking by intervals, so that they seldom part ere they get their
Skins full of Drink. The Entertainments are performed with the Drum and Pipe, and
there is set at the head of the deceased a Pot of Wine or Water, which is changed twice a
day, and that for several years afterwards.</p>

Alonso</hi> was no sooner arrived there, but the King of <hi>Beny</hi> made a Treaty with him, and

                     <hi>Ptolomey</hi>'s Tables discover, that he knew nothing of the people who live between these
two Rivers,<note place="margin">The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the <hi>Cabo Verde.</hi>
                     </note> so that to speak pertinently of them, we are to credit the modern Relations,
which affirm, that the people called <hi>Budumeys</hi> are possest of the Eastern part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and reach as far as <hi>Cabo Verde:</hi> The <hi>Foules,</hi> and <hi>Berbecines,</hi> are quarter'd further with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Country, upon the River <hi>Zanaga,</hi> and more Northerly then the <hi>Ialofes,</hi> whereof
some are subject to the <hi>Foules,</hi> others to the <hi>Budumeyes.</hi> They call their King <hi>Breque,</hi> and
their Country is plain and fenny, but very fertile in Cattle, Wine, Cotton, Ivory, wild Fowl,
and Horses, by reason of the frequent inundations of the River. They have neither Gold
nor Silver, but abundance of Iron, whereof they make all sorts of Instruments, and Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils.
The Air there is very wholsom, though there be no great change of Seasons. The
Inhabitants of <hi>Cabo Verde</hi> are accounted couragious, and they have learnt of the <hi>Zene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes,</hi>
their Neighbours,<note place="margin">Are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</note> the Art of mannaging Horses, as they have also <hi>Paganisme,</hi> which
they profess.</p>
                  <p>They have this advantage over their Neighbours, that Justice is better administred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them then elsewhere; that they proceed with greater prudence and secrecy about
publick Affairs, which concern the greatness and safety of the State; and that they impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
dispose punishments and rewards. The Prince, when he makes choice of any for
his Council, regards principally their Age, and he bestows the place of Judicature on such
among them as have most experience, and are best acquainted with Affairs. These fit every
day to hear Causes, and decide Differences.</p>
                  <p>They know nothing of our Military discipline,<note place="margin">Their way of raising forces.</note> but their way of making war hath
something particular in it, which is this: All that are able to bear Arms, are disposed into
several Regiments, and lodged in Quarters appointed for that purpose, under their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
whom they call <hi>Iugarases;</hi> so that as soon as there is any occasion, the Orders are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
from Quarter to Quarter, and by that means a powerful Army is raised in a few
dayes, without any need of making new Levies; in as much as the places are kept for the
Sons of the Souldiers, who succeed their Fathers, and put the Prince to no charge, but
what he allows them by way of salary, since they bring their provisions and baggage along
with them.</p>
                  <p>The names of buying and selling are not yet known among them: for having neither
Gold nor Silver coined, they truck and exchange all, as well among themselves as with
Forreigners. Their greatest Commerce consists in trucking of Hides and Slaves. Of these
they have only such as they take in war, which being many times civil among themselves,
they make the best advantage they can of them.</p>
                  <p>They have among them some distinction of Nobility and Peasantry,<note place="margin">Their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</note> and call the former
<hi>Sahibibos,</hi> who are a kind of Knights, for whom they have a great respect, but not so much
as they bear the Grandees, whom they call <hi>Thubalas,</hi> out of which rank they chuse their
King, provided he be full thirty years of age.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Portuguez</hi> discovered the Country of the <hi>Ialofes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The state of the Country when first discovered.</note> there reign'd a very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Prince, named <hi>Brabiran,</hi> who dying left three Sons, by two several Wives. By the
former, he had <hi>Cibitam</hi> and <hi>Camba,</hi> and by the second, who was the Widow of another
Prince, Father of <hi>Beomi, Biran,</hi> who was chosen King after the Fathers death. His two
elder Brethren, envying the greatness of that Prince, declared themselves so openly against
him, that <hi>Biran,</hi> who had great assurances of the affection and fidelity of <hi>Beomi,</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the same Mother, took him so much into favour, that he seem'd to have reserved
to himself only the name of King. But that extraordinary favour prov'd fatal to both;
for <hi>Biran</hi> was kill'd by his Brethren, and <hi>Beomi,</hi> who thought to make his advantage of
that Fratricide, to get himself chosen, took up Arms against the two Brethren. He got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
a considerable Army; but being afterwards forsaken by his Friends, he was forc'd
to apply himself to <hi>Portugal</hi> for relief. King <hi>Iohn II.</hi> having got him instructed in the
<hi>Christian Religion,</hi> had him baptized with all his Family, and sent him back with a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Fleet, under the conduct of <hi>Pedro Vaz de Cogna,</hi> whom he ordered to build a Fort
at the mouth of the River <hi>Zanaga,</hi> it being his design to get further into <hi>Africk,</hi> as far as
the Country of <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> whereof he had but a confused knowledge. But that great
design proved abortive, and miscarried at the beginning, through the cowardice of <hi>Pedro
Vaz,</hi> who minding his convenience more then his honour, demolished the Fort he had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
built, and not able to endure the just reproaches which <hi>Beomi</hi> made him upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he kill'd him with his own hands, the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> not expressing the least resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of so base an action.</p>
                  <p>The Islands, which the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>As Ilhas Verdes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Green Island.</note> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Salt-Islands,</hi>
lye over against <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> and were not discovered by the <hi>Portuguez</hi> till the year 1472.
Some are of opinion, they are the <hi>Gorgonides</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy:</hi> but I dare not affirm, that that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47786:306"/>
great Person, who hath left us so confused an account of that Coast of <hi>Africk,</hi> knew any
thing of these Islands, whereof the nearest is 70. and the most remote 160. Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the Continent. They reach from the 15. to the 19. degree, and are in number
ten, to wit, St. <hi>Iago,</hi> St. <hi>Antonio, Santa Lucia, Sant. Vincenle,</hi> St. <hi>Nicholas, Ilha blanca,
Ilha de sal, Ilha de Mayo, Ilha de Eogo,</hi> and <hi>Ilha de Boa Vista.</hi> It is probable, the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi>
gave them the general name of <hi>Ilhas Verdes,</hi> or the <hi>Green-Islands,</hi> either from the
Cape we spoke of before, or from the verdure which floats upon the water in those parts,
and which the <hi>Portuguez</hi> call <hi>Sargasso,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sargasso.</note> from its resemblance to Water-cresses. The Sea is
so covered there with, from the twentieth to the twenty fourth degree, that they seem to be
floating Islands, intended to block up the passage of Ships. Nay, this Herb is so thick
thereabouts, that, without a pretty strong Gale of wind, it would be no easie matter to
pass that way. Yet can it not be fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Sea hath no bottom, there being not any but in those parts, at above a hundred and
fifty Leagues from the Coasts of <hi>Africk.</hi> They were desert and not inhabited, when the
<hi>Portuguez</hi> discovered them; but now they are cultivated, and bring forth plenty of Rice,
Millet, <hi>Abruin,</hi> or <hi>Turkish</hi> wheat, Oranges, Citrons, <hi>Bananas, Annanas, Ignaues,</hi> Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes,
Melons, Citruls, Cowcumbers, Figs and Raisins, twice a year. The Islands of <hi>Mayo,
de Sal,</hi> and <hi>de Boa Vista,</hi> are so stored with Cattle, that they load whole Ships thence for
<hi>Brasil.</hi> The same Islands yield also such abundance of Salt, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have taken oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
thence to name them the <hi>Salt-Islands.</hi> The same <hi>Portuguez</hi> brought thither <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi>

are white all over the body, and have wings of a lively red, near the colour of fire, and are

with so much Fish, that, at all times, a man may find there many <hi>Portugal</hi> Vessels, fishing for
the provision of <hi>Bresil.</hi> Whence it may be inferred, they lie very conveniently for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing

reigns there all the year long, as we said before.</p>

for a Cittadel; and the other, called the Castle of Saint <hi>Sebastiant,</hi> is built upon one of the
points, which shut up the Port, which it defends with the Artillery. On the other point

is fastned to the Earth by an infinite number of Roots, yellow as Gold, and as small as the
Hair of Mans Head. The Inhabitants use it instead of Wooll and Feathers, to fill their

was not better served at <hi>London,</hi> then the Admiral was in his Vessel. We were so well
treated there, that night began to draw on ere we got away.</p>
                  <p>Our Ship was not above a Musket shot from the Admiral's but we were no sooner

to cast out the water with our hats.</p>
                  <p>In the precedent part of this Relation, the Reader may have observed, that we had
been in many great dangers ere we got to the Coasts of <hi>England;</hi> but certain it is, that
we were then in, was far greater then any we had escaped; since we were in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to perish in fight of our dear Country, and to be wrackt in the Port, whereto we
were already arriv'd. We were above four hours in these extremities, and at last we
discovered a little Vessel, which had lost all its Anchors but the last, which was not so
fastned, but that the wind forc'd it towards the Sea. We were in water up to the waste,
but that hindred us not from setting our selves to the Oares, so that with much adoo we
got to the said Vessel. Assoon as we were got into it, we found that it was as unsafe to
be there, as to continue in our own; in regard the Anchor being not able to stay it, we
were in danger of being cast on a certain bank, which is one of the most dangerous of
any about that Coast. And indeed, we should hardly have recovered our selves out of
that fear, had we been in a condition to reflect on the danger we were in: but the cold
we had endured, the good chear we had made, the salt water we had swallowed down in
our boat, and the violent and extraordinary motion of that little Vessel, put us so out
of order, that we were better then half dead, when we were brought the next day to our
Ship, where we were received as persons risen from the dead, inasmuch as all who had seen
our boat carried away by the violence of the winds, had given us over for irrecoverably
lost; nay, so far did they despair of ever seeing us again, that they had already bewailed
our death.</p>

Lord Major sent to invite us. He was so pleased with the Presidents discourse, that he
prevail'd with him to come again the next day. The Lord Major was indeed himself very
excellent for discourse, and having heard what dangers he had escaped in that great
Voyage, he would shew us that they were not to be compared with such as some others
had been in. He gave us the story of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Sea-man, who being condemned for a crime,
his punishment was changed, and he was ordered to be left in St. <hi>Helens</hi>'s Island, a place
we have spoken of before. This unhappy person representing to himself the horrour of
that solitude much beyond what it really was, since it came not near that we shall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to speak of anon, fell into a despair, that made him attempt the strangest Action
that ever was heard of.</p>
                  <p>There had that day been interr'd in the same Island an Officer of the Ship:<note place="margin">A strange attempt of a <hi>Duch</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner.</note> This Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
took up the body out of the Coffin, and having made a kind of rudder of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
board, ventured himself to Sea in it. It hapned fortunately to him, to be so great a
calm, that the Ship lay as it were immoveable, within a League and half of the Island;
but his companions seeing so strange a kind of boat floating on the water, imagined they
saw a Spectre, and were not a little startled at the resolution of the man, who durst ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
himself upon that Element, in three boards slightly nail'd together, which a small
wave might have overturned, though he had no confidence to be received by those, who
had so lately sentenc'd him to death. Accordingly it was put to the question whether
he should be received or not, and some would have the sentence put in execution; but
at last, they concluded in <hi>mitiorem,</hi> and he was taken aboard, and came afterwards to
<hi>Holland,</hi> where he lived in the Town of <hi>Horn,</hi> and related to many, how miraculously
God had delivered him.</p>
                  <p>Whereto the <hi>Lord Major</hi> added, that it was a great mistake in the said Sea-man, to take
so desperate a resolution, upon pure thoughts of the solitude of that Place, since the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> leave their sick there from year to year, to recover themselves of the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of their long Voyages, and that he could give them an example, which condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the fortunate temerity of that man, whom fear caused to do what the most resolute
courage would never have attempted.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1616. a <hi>Flemming</hi> named <hi>Pickman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An example of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful solitude.</note> well known in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
for the Art he had in getting out of the Sea the great Guns of that <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, which
was forc'd upon the Coasts of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the year 1588. coming from
<hi>Dronthem</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> with a Vessel loaden with boards, was overtaken by a calm, during
which, the current of the Sea carried him upon a Rock or little Island, towards the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he was in some danger to be cast away. To avoid a wrack,
he commanded some of his men to go into the Shallop, and to tow off the Ship. These
having done so, would needs go up into a certain Rock to look for Eggs; but assoon as
they were got up into it, they at some distance perceived a man, whence they imagine
there were others lay lurking thereabouts, and that he had made his escape thither to
avoid some Pirats which might surprise their Ship: so that they made all the haste they
could to their Shallop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and returned to their Ship. But the calm continuing, and the
current of the Sea, driving the Vessel against that Island, they were forc'd to get into
the long boat, and tow her off again. The man they had seen before was in the mean
time come to the brink of the Island, and made signs to them with his hands, intreating
them to come nearer, and falling on his knees, and joyning his hands together, begg'd
relief from them. At first, there was some difficulty made; but coming nearer the Island,
they saw something, which was more like a Ghost, then a living person, a body stark
naked, black and hairy, a meagre and deformed countenance, and hollow and distorted
eyes, which raised such compassion in them, that they proffered to take him into the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47786:310"/>
boat; but the Rock being so steepy thereabouts, that it was impossible to land, they
went about the Island, and came at last to a flat shore, where they took the man aboard.
They found nothing at all in the Island, nor grass, nor tree, nor ought whence a man could
derive any subsistance, nor any shelter, but the ruines of a boat, wherewith he had made
a kind of Hut, under which he might lye down, and shelter himself from the rain and
injuries of the weather.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sun was set ere they got to the Ship, and immediately, there rose a wind, which
forc'd them off from the Island; whence they imagined that what they had brought with
them was not a man, since he had not the Figure of one; whereupon they would know
of him who he was, and how he came to that uninhabitable place. He made answer,</hi>
He was an <hi>English-man,</hi> and that about a year before, being to pass in the ordinary passage
boat from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they were taken by a <hi>French</hi> Pirate, who being forced
by the Tempest which immediately rose, to let go the passage boat, left us to the mercy of the
waves, which carried us between <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> into the main Sea, expecting to be
cast away every minute, as at last we were. For the bark being split against the Rock where
you took me in, I escap'd with one of my comrades into the Island, in a more wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
then if being swallowed up by the Sea, we had been delivered out of the extremities we
were in for want of meat and drink.</p>
                  <p>Of some of the boards of our boat, we made the Hut you saw, and we took some Sea-mews,
which we set a drying in the wind and Sun, and so eat them raw. We found also, in the
erevices of the Rock, upon the Sea-side, some Eggs, and thus had we wherewithal to subsist,
as much as served to keep us from starving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what we thought most insupportable, was thirst,
in regard the place affording no fresh water, but what fell from the sky and was left in certain
pits, which Time had made in the Rock, we could not have of it at all seasons, by reason the
Rock being small, and lying low, the waves came over the Island, and fill'd th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pits with
salt-water. We lived in that condition six weeks, comforting one another, and finding some
ease in our common misfortune, till that being left alone, it began to grow insupportable to
me. For one day awaking in the morning, and missing my comrade, I fell into such a despair,
that I had some thoughts of casting my self down headlong, and so putting a final period
to that affliction, whereof I had endured but the one half, while <hi>I</hi> had a friend divided it with
me. <hi>I</hi> know not what became of him, whither despair forc'd him to that extremity; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
getting up in the night, not fully awake, he fell into the Sea; but <hi>I</hi> am of opinion, he
fell in through carelesness, as he looked for Eggs in the crevices of the Rock, which as you
saw was very steepy, on that side; Inasmuch as having observed no distraction in him, <hi>I</hi> cannot
imagine, he should of a sudden fall into that despair, against which he had fortified himself
by continual and earnest prayers. <hi>I</hi> lost, with my comrade, the knife wherewith we killed the
Sea-dogs, and the Mews, upon which we lived; so that not able to kill any more, <hi>I</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to this extremity, to get out of one of the boards of my Hut a great nail, which <hi>I</hi>
made a shift so to sharpen upon the Rock, that it served me for a knife. The same necessity put
me upon another invention, which kept me the last winter, during which <hi>I</hi> endured the greatest
misery imaginable. For finding the Rock and my Hut so covered with Snow, that it was
impossible for me to get any thing abroad, <hi>I</hi> put out a little stick at the crevice of my Hut;
and baiting it with a little Sea-dogs fat, <hi>I</hi> by that means got some Sea-mews, which <hi>I</hi> took
with my hand from under the Snow, and so <hi>I</hi> made a shift to keep my self from starving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> lived in this condition and solitude above elevon months, and was resolved to end my
days in it, when God sent you hither to deliver me out of the greatest misery th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> ever man was
in.</p>
                  <p>The Sea-man having ended his discourse, the Master of the Ship treated him so well
that within a few dayes he was quite another creature. He set him ashore at <hi>Derry</hi> in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and saw him afterward at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where such as had heard what hapned to
him, gave him wherewithal to return into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord Major made us acknowledge, that in all we had suffered, there was
nothing extraordinary, and that long Voyages, are never without great dangers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.
He urged it to us, that as Ships are now built, and considering the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
men have of the course taken for the <hi>Indies,</hi> there is no more danger in those long
Voyages, then in such as are made in the sight of Land, which Sea-man fear most.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose he related a story, wherein we could no less admire the strange Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
of two men, then the goodness of God in their deliverance beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
                  <p>Four <hi>Christian</hi> slaves being in the Ship of an <hi>Algire</hi>-pirate,<note place="margin">A strange resolution of two Slaves</note> resolved to make their
escape in a boat, which one of them, who was a Carpenter, undertook to build. The
Carpenter set himself on work about making on woodden Pins, and other pieces necessary
for the fastning of the boards, whereof the boat was to consist.</p>

The <hi>Turkish</hi> Captain asked him one day what he did, and was satisfied with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the other made him, that it was only to avoid being idle, and to have things in
readiness to mend the long boat, when need were. Having appointed a time for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of their design, they took off five boards from the room, where the provision
was kept, whereof they used two for the bottom, two others for the sides, and the
fifth for the prow and the poop, and so made up somewhat that was more like a trough
then a boat. Their quilt served them for tow, and having pitcht the boat well, they set
it into the water: but when they would have got into it, they found that two men
loaded it so, that being in danger of sinking, two of the four desisted from an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
wherein they thought to meet with more danger, then in staying a while longer
among the <hi>Turks,</hi> so that only two, one <hi>English</hi> man, the other a <hi>Dutch</hi>-man, ventured
themselves in it. All the tackling they had was only two oars, and a little Sail; all the
provisions, a little bread and fresh water; and so they put to Sea, without either Compass
or Astrolabe; insomuch that being the first day overtaken by Tempest, which at every
wave fill'd their boat, they were forc'd to go as the wind drove them, without keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any course. They were continually imploy'd in casting out the water; the Sea had
spoiled their bread; and they were almost quite spent, inasmuch as they could not take
any rest, when they were cast upon the Coasts of <hi>Barbary.</hi> There they found a little wood,
wherewith they somewhat enlarg'd their boat; but they narrowly escap'd being taken and
kill'd by the <hi>Moors,</hi> and had much ado to get to Sea again. What troubled them most,
was thirst; but they made some shift for that, with the blood of some Tortoises they
took, and at last, after ten days floating up and down, they arrived upon the Coasts of
<hi>Spain,</hi> at the Cape of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> between <hi>Alicant</hi> and <hi>Valentia.</hi> Those of the Country
seeing them at a distance, sent a boat to meet them, carried them bread and wine, treated
them very civilly, and found them passage for <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>The sixth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> being <hi>Twelfth-day,</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi> touched many that
were troubled with the <hi>Evil.</hi> The Ceremony ended, my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> brought me
to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> who was pleased to honour me with the kissing of his hand. The
next day, the same Lord procured me the like Honour from the Queen; besides which
he did me several other extraordinary favours, upon all occasions. Afterwards I went
often to Court, where their Majesties were pleased I should entertain them with some
particulars of my Travels; especially as to what I had observed in <hi>Muscovy</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I continued at <hi>London</hi> near three months, partly to refresh my self after so long a
Voyage, and partly in expectation of some mony from my own Prince, that I night
make some acknowledgments of my Obligations to those who had treated me so kindly,
from the day of my arrival at <hi>Surat</hi> to that time, and set my self in a posture of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into my own Country. Of the time of my abode in <hi>England,</hi> I spent some at Court,
where I had made several acquaintances, and some in viewing the publick and private
Structures of the famous City of <hi>London;</hi> as also several places near it; as among others,
<hi>Enfield, Tibulls, White-Hall, Saint Iame's, Hampton-Court, Windsor, Westminster-Hall,</hi>
and the <hi>Abbey,</hi> the <hi>Tower, Greenwich,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>[Of the places above mentioned here in <hi>England,</hi> as also some of those he
passed through in the Low-Countries, the Author gives a short description.
But in regard what he says of the former, is known to most <hi>English-men,</hi> who
are in any measure acquainted with the things remarkable in their own

we thought fit to forbear the insertion thereof, that we might make the more

so far with some Merchants of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> that in the year 1595. they sent out
four Ships, which thay sent along the Coasts of <hi>Africk,</hi> and the <hi>Cape of good Hope</hi> into
the <hi>Indies;</hi> inasmuch as the design, which some others had to find out a passage North-ward,
had not proved effectual. About two years and four months after these Ships
returned to <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> and though the profits of this first Voyage answered not the
expectations of the persons concerned, yet were they such as engaged several other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
in the same design; so that in the year 1598. they sent thither a second Fleet,
consisting of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight great Ships. They would not stay the return of this Fleeet, but in
the year 159<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. set forth another, and much about the same time some other Merchants
made up a new Company, and set out a particular Fleet, insomuch as to prevent the
destruction of Trade likely to be occasioned by many different interests, the States of
the United Provinces, in the year 1602. brought the persons concern'd to an agreement
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47786:312"/>
among themselves, and reduced them into one common Company, under their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the direction of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as Admiral of those Provinces.</p>
                  <p>By this Agreement, thus authorised by a Grant of the States for one and twenty years,
there was a regulation made, according to which the oversight of all that trade was put
into the hands of the chiefest persons concern'd therein, divided into six Chambers or
Courts, which were settled at <hi>Amsterdam; Middleborough</hi> for <hi>Zealand;</hi> at <hi>Delf</hi> and <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam</hi>
for the <hi>Meuse;</hi> and at <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>Enckhuisen</hi> for <hi>West-Friesland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first consisted of twenty Directors; that of <hi>Middleborough</hi> of twelve, and the
four others of seven a piece, so that in all charges, that of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> bore the one half, that
of <hi>Zealand</hi> a quarter part; those of <hi>Meuse</hi> and <hi>West-friesland</hi> each a half-quarter. It was
also ordered, that to General Assemblies, that of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> should send eight Deputies,
that of <hi>Zealand</hi> four, and those of the <hi>Meuse</hi> and <hi>West friesland,</hi> each of them two, with a
supernumerary for a casting voice, which was to be appointed by the Chambers of <hi>Zealand,</hi>
the <hi>Meuse,</hi> and <hi>West-friesland</hi> alternately.</p>
                  <p>The Stock of this Company amounted to six Millions six hundred <hi>French</hi> Livers,
which was laid out in the setting forth of several Fleets; and the first Voyages proved so
fortunate, that it was found in the year 1613. that the money of the persons concern'd
had gain'd two hundred and sixty upon the hundred. But the profits were much greater
the year following, as may be seen by the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It were impossible to imagine any thing more delightful, or more regularly disposed then

that painting could add nothing thereto, and so well furnish'd within, that there are
some, whereof only the Pictures were enough to enrich a man. But what most speaks the
cost imploy'd about them is least seen: For all the Houses being built on piles, it must be
confessed, the foundations are no less precious then the rest of the Structure, and that
there is not so noble a Forrest in the World as that which the City of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  <p>Among the publick Structures the Churches are remarkable; and among others, those
called the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> and the three others built some years since by the Magistrate.
In the former is the Epitaph of <hi>Iacob de Heemskerk,</hi> who, having made two Voyages to
<hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> was kill'd at the Streights of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> where he set upon

                  <p>What a noble and neat place is the Hospital and Convent of St. <hi>George,</hi> where there are
now received great numbers of Aged persons of both Sexes, who are maintained there?
What more charitable, then the care and tenderness wherewith distracted persons are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
And what severity do they not exercise in the ordering of incorrigible persons; the
men in a House, over the door whereof there is in golden Letters,</p>
                  <q>VIRTVTIS EST DOMARE, CVNCTI PAVENT.</q>
                  <p>Where they are constantly imployed in sawing Brasil with inexpressible pains, or some
other work, according to the nature of the Crime for which they were sentenced to that
punishment; and the women in another house by themselves? But there is not any thing
so miraculous as the order observed there for the education of poor Orphans, who are
very well kept, maintain'd, and taught; as also in the administration of their Estates who
are under Guardians; these being obliged to give an account thereof to the Magistrate.</p>

The Exchanges of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Antwerp</hi> are indeed noble places; but there is something
more magnificent in that of <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> at least this may be affirm'd of it, that for the
number of Merchants daily resorting thither at noon, neither of the other two is to be
compared to it.</p>
                  <p>I may put also among the publick Structures, the Weighing places, the Gates of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the three Sluces, which have not their like in the World; the publick School, or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which the Magistrate hath opened there some years since; The Arsenal, the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
for Playes, the Anatomy-Hall, the places appointed for shooting with Long-bow,
Cross bow, and the Arquebuse; and if I may be allowed to speak of a thing which is not
yet, but no doubt will be within a few years, and whereof I have seen the draught, I
mean the Town-house, or Guild-hall, I may boldly say there is not any in <hi>Europe</hi> comes
near it.</p>
                  <p>I stayed at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> eight dayes, and finding something in that City which pleased my
fancy beyond what I had observed in any I saw before, I was unwilling to see any more,
but having my imagination full of it, I took shipping the twenty third of <hi>April</hi> for <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
whither I reach'd the twenty eighth following. I rested my self there one day,
and got the first of <hi>May</hi>
                     <note place="margin">MAY.</note> to <hi>Gottorp,</hi> where I presented my self to their Highnesses the
Duke and Dutchess of <hi>Holstein,</hi> and so put a period to my long and toilsome TRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VELS.</p>
