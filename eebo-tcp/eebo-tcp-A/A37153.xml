            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Need not make an Apology for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Account of the Laſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne to You; for ſince Cuſtom will have every Trifle that is publiſh'd, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory,</hi> I ſhould be very Ungrateful, if I did not embrace this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ccaſion to acknowledge to the World the many Obligations I have to You: Though, to acquit my ſelf of it, I muſt put your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Name to a Piece in which I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible You muſt find a great many Faults. For, 'tis impoſſible that a Man ſhould judge ſo
<pb facs="tcp:55269:3"/>
Juſtly and Equally of the Affairs of War, as to give an Account of them free from any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, unleſs he has as great a ſhare in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of them as You have. However, I am very glad it gives me the Opportunity to expreſs, in ſome meaſure, my Gratitude for Your Favours.</p>
            <p>When the Dean of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> (whom I muſt acknowledge for the Author of my Happineſs, in belonging to You) recommended me to be Chaplain to Your Regiment, I cannot forget how willing you was to Receive me; as if you had been long expecting an Opportunity of Doing Good to a Friend, though I was then a Stranger to You: This Favour was, indeed, more than I could expect. But Your Generoſity ſtopt not here; You have treated me ever ſince, with ſo much Civility and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Kindneſs, that I cannot be ſilent, but muſt own the Thankful Senſe I have of it as publickly as I can. I muſt yet value Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the more, that they come from a Perſon of ſo much Worth and Merit, that you excuſe and free me from the common Fault of others, in ſwelling an Epiſtle with Praiſe and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; the whole Army knows more of it than
<pb facs="tcp:55269:3"/>
my mean Rhetorick can expreſs. Thoſe who have been at the Siege of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> repeat with Pleaſure, to this day, the early Proofs You gave of Your Martial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Courage. Your Vertue and Valour has ever ſince encreas'd with Your Honour; and this preſent War has done you Juſtice, in raiſing You to ſuch Conſiderable Poſts in the Army, as have given a better Light to Your Merit. I could ſpeak with Pleaſure of Your Exploits in the Battle of <hi>Steenkirk,</hi> where the Brigade under Your Conduct and Command did ſuch Conſiderable Service: And in that of <hi>Landen,</hi> where You fought with ſo much Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Bravery, that (notwithſtanding the Inequality of the Number) You often Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd Your Poſt, and Repuls'd ſeveral times the victorious Enemy: Your Brigade was then in the Right Wing; where the Elector of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> was a joyful Witneſs of Your Valour and Conduct, which He expreſs'd in the kindeſt and the moſt endearing manner.</p>
            <p>But I remember I am writing an <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and not your <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more, but, That You are a Soldier of the KING's Own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and that You have been Train'd in His
<pb facs="tcp:55269:4"/>
Service from Your Infancy. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> is an Excellent Judge of Merit, which is the Standard by which He meaſures His Favours: So that though Your Birth is Great and Noble, yet 'tis Your Own Perſonal Worth that has Rais'd You to be Major-General of Their Majeſty's Forces. If You owe a Noble Birth to the Earls of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſy,</hi> You ſufficiently repay the Nobility of Your Extraction with Your Great Vertues and Accompliſhments, which make You now the Ornament of Your Family.</p>
            <p>May You Live, long to enjoy theſe Rewards of Your Worth and Vertue; and whatever elſe is laid up in the Stores of a Great, Juſt, and Bountiful Monarch. May You live to enjoy them for Their Majeſty's Service, the Comfort of Your Vertuous and Excellent Lady, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of Your Family, the Joy of Your Friends, and the Honour and Credit of Your Nation. Theſe are the Hearty Prayers and Wiſhes of</p>

            <p>THIS being the Third Account I publiſh of this kind, I would venture it without the Ceremony of of a <hi>Preface,</hi> if I was not obliged to excuſe ſome Faults which may happen in the Impreſſion: For I Write ſo ill my ſelf, that I have been forc'd to get it Copy'd, to make it legible: I could not get the ſame Hand that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd the laſt: It has now been Copy'd with ſome Faults; which I could not Correct, without making it as difficult to Read as the Original. But I have recommended it to Friends, who cannot only Correct the Faults of the Copyer, but my Own too: Which Favour I beg from them, ſince my own Affairs here will not permit me to be in <hi>England</hi> to ſee it Printed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, That I have us'd all poſſible Diligense to give an Exact and Impartial Account of Affairs, to inform the People of <hi>England</hi> (that have ſo great a ſhare in the Burden of this Preſent War) of the Truth; and to diſabuſe them of many Stories impos'd upon them; ſome, by the Enemies of the Preſent Government, and Friends to the French Interest; and others, by ſome Bigotted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional People, who do their utmost to foment H<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I cannot excuſe this, nor any of the former Accounts, from ſeveral Miſtakes.

            <p>I dare ſay, this Preſent War now is drawing near to a happy End; and if God grants me Life to have my ſhare in the Bleſſings of Peace, I will publiſh all the particular Accounts together of the ſeveral Campagnes I have ſeen in <hi>Flanders,</hi> exactly Corrected and Amended, with the Draughts and Planes of the Battles and Sieges: and I will uſe my best Endeavours to free them from all Errors and Miſtakes, by a diligent Search into Authentick Papers; and a ſtrict Enquiry among all the Knowing Perſons of the Army, the Honour of whoſe Friendſhip and Kindneſs I may pretend to, ſeveral of them having been very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to aſſiſt me in what I have already done; and I need not doubt of the ſame Favour, when there ſhall be Time and Leiſure to bring the Work to Perfection.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE CAMPAGNE IN THE Spaniſh Netherlands, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1694.</head>
            <p>OUR Laſt Year's Hiſtory left Both Armies going into Winter-Quarters, the <hi>French</hi> on their ſide fluſh'd with a conſiderable Victory, and with the Succeſs they had in the Siege of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> with which they cloſed the Laſt Campagne; and though they never had a greater Occaſion to be ſtirring, than during the laſt Winter-Quarters, yet the <hi>French</hi> have not been ſo quiet all this War, as they were at that time. The <hi>French King</hi> knew very well that the Allies were unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly reſolved to augment conſiderably their Forces on all ſides, and to bring ſuch Armies in the Field the following Campagne, as might put a ſtop to the Progreſs of his Arms,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55269:6"/>
and oblige him to be now on the Defenſive, who before had been ſo Violent and ſo Succeſsful an Aggreſſor.</p>
            <p>And though Alliances are attended with great Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and that the Operations of Allied Armies cannot be ſo Active and Brisk, as when they are the Reſults of one Single, Wiſe, and Abſolute Head; yet, on the other ſide, they have this great Conveniency and Advantage, that when there is a good and perfect Correſpondence between Allied Powers, their very Defeats improve their Strength, and they gather Power from their own Diſadvantages; becauſe that makes them the more ſenſible of the Greatneſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, and of the neceſſity of a Mutual and Vigorous Defence; and the Spring and Sources of War, both for Money and Men, being many, they can with ſo much the more Eaſe to their reſpective States, not only recruit, but augment their Forces. We have had good experience of this Truth in the preſent War, in which the Allies have kept a better Union and Correſpondence than they had in any former Alliances.</p>
            <p>The great Victory which the French had over Prince <hi>Waldeck,</hi> in the Plains of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> ſerved to bring an Army into the Field, even the latter end of the ſame Campagne, of 70000 Men: which has ſince oblig'd the French King to augment his Forces to ſo vaſt a Number, to keep up the Credit of his ſucceſsful Armies, that he has entirely exhauſted his Treaſures, and now finds himſelf puſh'd to ſuch a <hi>non-plus,</hi> that far from being able to augment his Forces, as the Allies have done ſince the Battel of <hi>Landen,</hi> he is hardly able to pay thoſe he has now on foot; and which is worſt of all, whereas before he ſupply'd the want of Money, in ſome meaſure, by making his Armies ſubſiſt in the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, he has had the Mortification, this Campagne, to ſee them eat and deſtroy his own Frontiers. There was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a certain Neceſſity that the French ſhould, in common Prudence, have undertaken ſomething the laſt Winter, which was the only Time they had left to keep up the Credit and Reputation of their Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55269:6"/>
And as there was a Neceſſity for them to have done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then; ſo (I may ſay) they have not had a fairer Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity all this War, if we conſider either the State of our Army, or the Poſture and Condition of Affairs in this Countrey. Our Army had been weaken'd by the Overthrow at <hi>Landen:</hi> And though our Loſſes were far from being ſo conſiderable as the French made it, yet no doubt it did very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concert our Affairs; and beſides, the Soldiers wading tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the <hi>Geet</hi> to make their eſcape, and lying wet for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Days after, cauſed many Sickneſſes amongſt them, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that our Engliſh and Scotch Forces never wanted more Recruits than they did the laſt Winter; and they have not yet been later in bringing their Recruits over, and in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating their Regiments: ſo that in reſpect of our Army, the French never had a greater Encouragement to put them upon ſome Action.</p>
            <p>And as for the Poſture and Condition of Affairs, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Countrey, the Death of the late Biſhop of <hi>Liege,</hi> and the following Diſſentions of the Chapter, gave the French King the happieſt Opportunity he could wiſh for, to have driven the Allies out of that Place; which, no doubt, would have made room for the Cardinal of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s Pretenſions in the following Election, and would have given him a great ſhare in the Suffrages of the Chapter. And though the Pope has given ſo authentick a Confirmation of the Juſtice of the Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi>'s Cauſe in the laſt diſputed Election, yet if the French had made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Liege</hi> the laſt Winter, 'tis very probable that the Cardinal of <hi>Bouillon</hi> would have found more Favour at the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Suit; and that the Committee of Cardinals deputed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, would have found a great deal of Right on his ſide in the French Canon Law, to have placed that Mitre upon his Head: And the Cardinal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> being abſolutely the French King's Creature, he could then have look'd upon the Principality of <hi>Liege</hi> as in a manner his own, and thus have advanc'd his Frontier to the very Gates of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> which, as to its Civil Government, is equally divided between the States-General and the Biſhop of <hi>Liege;</hi> which then would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55269:7"/>
have open'd to him an Inlet into the States Dominions, the thing he has ſo much long'd for, and has been ſo much endeavouring after all this preſent War. As for <hi>Newport,</hi> and the Frontiers in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the King provided for their Safety, by ſending the laſt Winter a ſpeedy Supply of Eight Battalions from <hi>England; Tiffeny</hi> and the three French Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments firſt, who were quarter'd in the <hi>Camerlings Ambacht,</hi> (for ſo the Countrey is call'd about the Canal of <hi>Newport,)</hi> and afterwards <hi>Lloyd, St. George, Friderick Hamilton,</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Ingoldsby</hi>'s Regiments, which were diſpos'd into Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for a time, in <hi>Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Newport;</hi> but ſtill I dare ſay, that the reſt of our Army was in no very good Condition to have taken the Field, if the French had undertaken any Siege during the Winter.</p>
            <p>All this being conſider'd, no other Reaſons can be alledged why the French were ſo quiet all the laſt Winter, and ſo contrary to their Intereſt, which oblig'd them to ſome Action, but theſe following. Firſt, The Dearth and Famine that raigned in <hi>France,</hi> and in the Conquer'd Countrey; which was indeed greater than can be expreſſed, or than can hardly be believ'd; though the French Court, and the King by his Edicts, us'd all poſſible means to prevent it, and to cover the inward Sufferings of his Kingdom. We have ſeen in <hi>Bruges,</hi> and in moſt of our Towns in <hi>Flanders,</hi> very lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Inſtances of it, where they fled from the neighbouring Parts of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Paiis Conquis,</hi> for Bread; and many of them had been ſo long without it, that though they had Bread given them, yet they could not eat it, and died in the Streets: They came in ſuch Multitudes, that the Magiſtrates have been forced to ſtand Centries at the Gates, to hinder them from coming in: But ſince they have had a fruitful Harveſt in <hi>France,</hi> his Edicts acknowledge in plain Terms, what but ſome Months before they ſmother'd over with fine Words, to amuſe and deceive the People. The French King, for this Reaſon, could not ſupply and fill his Stores with Corn, a Thing abſolutely neceſſary for a Winter Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne: His Subjects were Hungry, and began to be Loud and Clamorous; which, if his Purveyors had bought up the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55269:7"/>
Corn of the Countrey to fill the King's Stores, might eaſily have been improved into a Revolt; for Seditions and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults about it there had been many in ſeveral Provinces of his Kingdom. The Second Reaſon, was, Becauſe his own Infantry, notwithſtanding the Victory at <hi>Landen,</hi> had been ſo well handled there, and had been ſo fatigu'd in the Siege of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> that his Battalions were ſo weak, they could not be in a Condition to ſerve in a Winter Siege, though the Miſery of his Countrey ſupplied his Army with raw Soldiers enough to recruit them. The Third, was, The ill Condition of his Cavalry; which, beſides the Loſſes of the foregoing Campagne, muſt be very much weaken'd by the want of Forage, the neceſſary Conſequence of the Famine at home, inſomuch, that whereas the French Troups had before the ſame complement with ours, yet the laſt Winter they were reduced to Forty a Troup; which does ſufficiently ſhew that the French King wanted Horſes, and that he could not re-mount his Cavalry. The Fourth Reaſon, was, The want of Money, which is juſtly called the Sinews of War, and without which, the beſt concerted Deſigns muſt miſcarry: And the Scarceneſs of Money was ſo great in his Army, that they ſubſiſted all the laſt Winter upon Credit in their ſeveral Quarters; even the very Lieutenants and Enſigns were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to have Credit in the Publick-Houſes and Vivandiers, the firſt for a Groat, and the latter for Three-pence a Day to ſubſiſt them. I may write this for Truth, becauſe 'twas the Report <note n="*" place="margin">Bruges.</note>here laſt Winter; and I enquired of Officers that were Priſoners this Summer in our Army, who owned it to have been ſo. Whilſt the French King's Affairs were ſo at Home, the Allies were encreaſing their Forces, and making new Levies in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Empire, Holland, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> to endeavour to turn the Scale of the War, which hitherto had turn'd ſo proſperouſly and ſucceſsfully on the French King's ſide. And the Event of this Campagne is a convincing Argument that they have not beſtow'd their Money in vain: That the French King has hitherto ow'd his Succeſs more to the Number of his Troops, than to their Bravery. Though I do not ſay this to leſſen the Praiſe and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55269:8"/>
Commendation they deſerve, but only to fix and ſettle the Judgment of Things in an equal Ballance; which is the right and juſt way of judging of Succeſs in Military and other Affairs.</p>

So that according to this <hi>List,</hi> the Dauphin had Sixty and Nine Squadrons in the Firſt and Second Line of his Right Wing of Horſe, and Sixty and Six in the Left, and Twenty and Nine Squadrons of Dragons, Huſſars and Mouſquetairs in the Reſerve, which makes in all 164 Squadrons. And becauſe the French had reformed their Troups of Horſe, laſt Winter, to Forties, we muſt compute each of their Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons to be, at their coming in the Field, of 120 Horſe-men; which makes the Total of the Horſe and Dragons of this Army to be 19680. The Foot conſiſted of Forty Battalions in the Firſt Line, and Thirty Nine in the Second, and Three in the Reſerve, which makes in all 82 Battalions; which, at 600 Men each Battalion, at the firſt coming into the Field, amounts to 49100 Men. So that the Total of this Army, Commanded by the Dauphin, and under him by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> and <hi>Villeroy,</hi> came to 68880 Men, beſides what belonged to the Artillery, as Gunners and Matroſſes, Miners, &amp;c. We ſhall not make a Computation of all the Forces the French had in <hi>Flanders,</hi> till we come to ſpeak of the Bodies Commanded by the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de la Valette;</hi> which ſhall be in their proper Places.</p>
               <p>The Dauphin being come with this Army to <hi>Gemblours,</hi> within a Day's March from ours; likewiſe there being but little Forage about our Camp, which hinder'd the Cavalry from ſubſiſting in it; the King, for this Reaſon, order'd to make a Retrenchment to cover our Body of Foot, in caſe the Enemy would have come to attack us. Our Right was cover'd by the Villages of <hi>Tourine</hi> and <hi>Bavechein;</hi> the firſt being juſt upon the brow of a Hill, below which runs a ſmall Current which has its Spring at <hi>Bavechein,</hi> and ſo goes by <hi>Ham,</hi> and other Villages, into the River <hi>Dyle:</hi> The Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade of Guards encamped upon another Hill, ſeparated from the Right of the Main Body by this Current, and cover'd the King's Quarter. The Left was cover'd by deep, hollow Ways, and other Defiles of the Villages of <hi>Sluys</hi> and <hi>Meldert,</hi> and a little Brook which riſes at <hi>Meldert,</hi> and ſo runs by <hi>Hoexem, Oirbeck,</hi> and <hi>Cumtick,</hi> to <hi>Tilmont:</hi> The Ground was
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55269:13"/>
Plain between the Villages of <hi>Bavechein</hi> upon the right, and <hi>Sluys</hi> upon the left, for about an Engliſh Mile and an half upon the Center of our Line; which Plain went from the Village of <hi>Boſſu,</hi> and the Abbey of <hi>Florival,</hi> croſs our Camp towards <hi>Tilmont:</hi> and again on the other ſide of the Villages of <hi>Sluys</hi> and <hi>Meldert,</hi> towards <hi>Judoigne.</hi> The French took up this Camp laſt Year, when we were encamped at <hi>Park,</hi> ſtretching their Line along the Plain from the Abbey of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival</hi> towards <hi>Tilmont,</hi> with the Villages of <hi>Tourine</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vechein</hi> in their Front, and <hi>Sluys</hi> and <hi>Meldert</hi> in their Rear, where they had their Head-Quarter. And the Year before, we encamped one Night in this Plain, ſtretching our Left another way, towards <hi>Judoigne;</hi> and the King's Quarter at <hi>Meldert;</hi> and our Right near the <hi>Bois de Merdal;</hi> which now at this Camp of <hi>Hertogendale</hi> remained in our Rear. This was the Situation of our Camp; ſo that nothing remain'd open to the Enemy but the Plain upon our Centre; which the King, upon the coming of the French to <hi>Gemblours,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd to be fortified with a Retrenchment from <hi>Bavechein</hi> to <hi>Sluys</hi> and <hi>Meldert.</hi> We had ſeveral Parties toward the <hi>Sambre,</hi> to obſerve the Motions of the French; and upon their March to <hi>Gemblours</hi> they took many Priſoners which had ſtraggled from the Army, among which were ſome of the late King's Guard. The 5th. the Three Second Battalions of Guards, and <hi>Eppinger</hi>'s Dragons, were ordered to encamp on the other ſide of the King's Quarter, between it and the <hi>Bois de Merdal,</hi> to cover it from Parties skulking in the Wood. The 6th. the Engliſh Artillery came up from <hi>Malines,</hi> under the Eſcort of <hi>Brewer, Leſley,</hi> and <hi>Buchan</hi>'s Regiments, which joyn'd us this Day. Theſe Three Regiments, with thoſe of <hi>Strathnaver</hi> and <hi>Hamilton,</hi> had come but lately from <hi>Scotland;</hi> they were put in Quarters at <hi>Leer</hi> and <hi>Malines,</hi> to put themſelves in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to take the Field, and <hi>Strathnaver</hi> and <hi>George Hamilton</hi> were ſent to <hi>Ghendt.</hi> Our Engliſh Train of Artillery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of Sixty Pieces of Cannon and Six Mortars, Four Companies of Gunners and Matroſſes, and One Company of Miners, all of One Hundred Men each. This ſame day we were alſo joyn'd by the Cavalry, who came up only to be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55269:13"/>
review'd, and encamp'd by Brigades in the ſeveral Intervals that had been left for them, (as we have ſaid before.) The King review'd, the ſame day, the Eight Regiments which had come up to the Camp the 4th under the Command of Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <hi>Collier,</hi> in the preſence of the Electors of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Cologne,</hi> who had left <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to come to <hi>Louvain,</hi> to be nearer the Army, where His Electoral Highneſs expected his own Bavarian Foot and Dragoons, to form a Camp of his own near <hi>Louvain.</hi> The day following, the King review'd all the Horſe that had come up the day before, the Electors being preſent: And as the ſeveral Regiments were reviewed, they march'd again to their reſpective Quarters where they had been before; the Engliſh, upon the Villages between <hi>Louvain, Arſchot,</hi> and <hi>Tilmont;</hi> and the Dutch, towards <hi>Haſſel</hi> and <hi>Leauwe;</hi> and appear'd all of them, both Men and Horſe, in very good Condition and Order. We were very careful for the Conſervation of Forage, which was but ſcarce in this Countrey. The Horſe, for this reaſon, continued can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd; and the Foot had Orders to cut down no Corn, upon pain of Death. On the 8th. the French march'd from <hi>Gemblours</hi> by One in the Morning, to <hi>Bonef,</hi> upon the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagine</hi> where the Dauphin had his Quarter. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the King ordered the Army to March the next day upon the Left, towards <hi>Tilmont,</hi> to be nearer, to obſerve the French, who were making their Motions between the <hi>Geet</hi> and the <hi>Jecker,</hi> towards <hi>Liege.</hi> Accordingly the Army march'd the next day towards <hi>Tilmont,</hi> and encamp'd with the Right at <hi>Rooſebeck,</hi> where the King had his Quarter; and the Left upon the <hi>Geet,</hi> between <hi>Tilmont</hi> and <hi>Linther.</hi> Our Front was cover'd upon the Left with the River <hi>Geet,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Tilmont;</hi> the Center, with the Villages of <hi>Cumtich,</hi> and the little River that runs into the <hi>Geet</hi> at <hi>Tilmont.</hi> We had the little River <hi>Velpe</hi> in our Rear, that falls into the <hi>Geet</hi> below <hi>Leauwe.</hi> So that our Right only was open in the Camp between the Village of <hi>Cumtich</hi> and that of <hi>Rooſebeck.</hi> The whole Body of Foot, conſiſting then of Eighty eight Battalions, encamped upon Two Regular Lines, and was diſpos'd in the Brigades following. Of the Engliſh and

Engliſh Pay, the Brigade of Guards upon both Lines: Upon the Firſt were the Brigades of <hi>Erle, Collier,</hi> and <hi>Alefeldt:</hi> In the Second Line, <hi>Stuart, Offarrel,</hi> and <hi>Haxhauſen.</hi> Of the Dutch, <hi>Deden, Anhalt,</hi> and <hi>Heukelom:</hi> In the Firſt Line, and <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zauw, Holſtein-Norburg</hi> and <hi>Bernſtort:</hi> In the Second, which made Thirteen Brigades of Foot, Seven Engliſh, and Six Dutch.</p>
               <p>The King, in the Winter, had made the Brigadiers <hi>Churchill</hi> and <hi>Ramſey,</hi> Major-Generals of his Forces: But at this Camp, the King declared Count <hi>Naſſau</hi> (that had been Major-General ever ſince His Majeſty's coming over to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> Lieutenant-General; and the Colonels <hi>Fitz-Patrick</hi> and <hi>Offarrel,</hi> Brigadiers. And in the Dutch Army, the Count <hi>de Noyelles</hi> was declared Lieutenant-General by the King; and he made the Brigadiers <hi>Fagel, Salich,</hi> and <hi>l'Eſcluſe,</hi> Major-Generals in the Infantry; and the Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Holſtein-Norburg,</hi> the Colonels <hi>Ratzauw</hi> and <hi>Dedem.</hi> Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: And of the Horſe, the Brigadiers <hi>Itterſum, Warfusé, Hubert,</hi> and <hi>Stain,</hi> were made Major-Generals; and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels <hi>Dompré, Roo, Lippe, Zell, Piper,</hi> and <hi>Montigny,</hi> were made Brigadiers. In the Engliſh Dragoons, Brigadier <hi>Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi> was made Major-General; and the Colonels, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> and <hi>Wyne,</hi> Brigadiers. But becauſe the Horſe did not come into the Line of Battle in this Camp, I ſhall omit the inſerting the <hi>List</hi> of the Army, till we come to the Camp at Mount St. <hi>André.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 10th. the French Army decamp'd from <hi>Bonef,</hi> upon the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> and marched into the <hi>Paiis de Liege,</hi> as far as St. <hi>Tron;</hi> the Dauphin's Quarter with the Right at this Place; the Left went along the <hi>Joar,</hi> or <hi>Jecker,</hi> almoſt as far as <hi>Warrem,</hi> which River remain'd then in their Rear. The ſame day, the King review'd <hi>Brewer, Leſley,</hi> and <hi>Buchan</hi>'s Regiments, the laſt of our Engliſh Infantry that had come into the Field.</p>
               <p>The 11th. the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> (whom we had left forming a ſmall Body in the County of <hi>Chiney,</hi> and who, upon the Marching of the French Army into the <hi>Paiis de Liege,</hi> had drawn nearer to <hi>Huy)</hi> paſs'd the <hi>Maes</hi> at <hi>Huy,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd

on the other ſide of the <hi>Jecker,</hi> between <hi>Warrem</hi> and the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> where he flank'd the Left of the Army, and cover'd the Communication with <hi>Namur;</hi> which otherwiſe would have ſuffer'd very much by our Parties and Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which would have had very fair Play upon their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions which ſhould have come to their Camp. The <hi>List</hi> of his Army was as follows, but I could not get it diſpos'd into Brigades.</p>

               <p>The Gentleman from whom I had this <hi>List</hi> did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>French,</hi> ſo that he abuſed ſeveral Names in the Copy; which I got rectified as much as I could, by informing my ſelf from Priſoners: which I have done all to two Regiments,

which I could make nothing of: However, if there be any Miſtake in the Names, there is none in the Summ. By which it appears, that the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> had, according to our foregoing Computation, 3000 Horſe, and 9000 Foot, which amounts to 12000 Men.</p>
               <p>The Marquis <hi>de Harcourt</hi> had form'd another Body of Horſe and Dragons in the <hi>Paiis de Luxembourg,</hi> of between Twenty and Thirty Squadrons; but I have not ſeen a Liſt of them. However, upon the Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi>'s paſſing the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> he came with his Army, and encamped in the <hi>Condros.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſame time, the Enemy formed another ſmall Body, between <hi>Harlebeck</hi> and <hi>Courtray,</hi> under the Command of the Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> Lieutenant-General of the French Forces, to cover their Line between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> in caſe we ſhould endeavour to make another Attempt on that ſide, as we had done the laſt Year. I have had a Liſt of this Army, but with the ſame misfortune as the former, to be a little mangl'd, for want of knowing the Language; however, where the Names were not <hi>French,</hi> or doubtful, I have omitted them.</p>

Which, as we have before computed, muſt make 2040 Horſe, and 6000 Foot. So that the French had in all, of Foot, in the Field, in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in the <hi>Dauphin, Boufflers,</hi> and <hi>La Valette</hi>'s Army, 107 Battalions, which makes 64200 Foot: And of Horſe in theſe Three Armies, and the Marquis <hi>de Harcourt</hi>'s (which we ſhall ſuppoſe to be 20 Squadrons, which, I dare ſay, was the leaſt,) 226 Squadrons; which, according to this Year's Computation of the French Squadrons, amounts to 27120 Horſe. So that the Total of the Enemy's Forces in <hi>Flanders,</hi> both Foot and Horſe, made 91320 fighting Men: Which is a very great Army, though inferiour to what they had the laſt Year.</p>
               <p>The French King having ſent his Fleet into the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,</hi> to make ſome conſiderable Conqueſt in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> had left his Coaſts deſtitute of any Defence from the Sea; for which reaſon he was obliged to have ſome Forces diſpers'd up and down the Provinces of <hi>Britany</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> to prevent a Deſcent, and the Inſults of our Fleet. Which he did effectually at the Bay of <hi>Camaret,</hi> though he had not the ſame Succeſs in other Places</p>
               <p>The French King likewiſe foreſeeing that the Allies would have ſuch an Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> the Campagne following, as would hinder any more Conqueſts on that ſide, thought it more convenient to make a conſiderable Detachment both of Horſe and Foot, the laſt Winter, towards <hi>Catalonia;</hi> where the ill Poſture of the Spaniſh Affairs gave him the Proſpect of keeping up the Credit and Reputation of his Arms by ſome Conqueſts: And 'tis very probable that he would have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd himſelf of the whole Principality of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> if the King had not provided for its Safety, by ſending our Fleet, under the Command of Admiral <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> into the <hi>Streights.</hi> Which ſo much thwarted the French Deſigns, that they were forced to content themſelves with the Taking of <hi>Palamos</hi> and <hi>Gironne,</hi> and to omit the more important Siege of <hi>Barcelona.</hi> This is the reaſon, that though the French had a very good Army in the Field this Campagne, in <hi>Flanders,</hi> yet it was very much inferiour to what they had at the Opening of the other Campagne. This Digreſſion may be forgiven, ſince it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55269:16"/>
 ſerves for a better underſtanding the Affairs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> with relation to former Campagnes.</p>
               <p>To oppoſe this little Army of the Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> of which we have now ſpoken, the Allies formed another of almoſt an equal ſtrength, which encamped at <hi>Mary Kirk,</hi> upon the Canal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> juſt by the Walls of <hi>Ghendt,</hi> under the Command of the Count <hi>de Merode Thian,</hi> Serjeant-General de Battaille of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Forces, which conſiſted of Seven Battalions encamp'd, <hi>viz</hi> the Second Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion of the Royal Regiment, which (as we have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) had remain'd in <hi>Bruges,</hi> at our going out to take the Field. And <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Regiment which was left at <hi>Oſtend;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Regiments of <hi>Strathnaver,</hi> and Colonel <hi>George Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton;</hi> and Three Dutch, <hi>viz. Holle, Weed,</hi> and <hi>Grave John:</hi> Van <hi>Horne,</hi> the Count <hi>de Thian,</hi> had beſides Three Terces, that is Regiments, of Walloon Foot quarter'd upon the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages thereabouts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Deinſe,</hi> the Count <hi>de Grobendonk,</hi> and the Baron <hi>de Winterfelt,</hi> which were very well Cloathed, and in very good Order, both for the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men, and their Accoutrements, and in a much better Condition than is uſual with the Spaniſh and Walloon Terces in this Country. As for the Count <hi>de Thian</hi>'s Cavalry, it conſiſted of Six or Seven Squadrons of Spaniſh Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, whoſe Liſt I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Having given this ſhort Account of the State of the French Army, and the Two little Armies They and We had in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> under the Command of the Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Thian,</hi> we muſt return to the Two Main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies towards the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> The 11th. in the Evening, we heard three Diſcharges of Cannon and Small-ſhot from the Enemy's Camp; which we heard, the next day, had been a <hi>Feu de Joye,</hi> for the Taking of <hi>Palamos,</hi> in <hi>Catalonia.</hi> The 12th. ſixteen Huſſars deſerted from the French Camp, and came to our Army: Theſe are Hungarian Horſe, the Emperor has ſeveral Regiments of them upon the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and one of their Chief having deſerted the Imperial Army about two Years ſince, ſo many were debauched by his Example, and for want of Pay, that the French King made a Regiment of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55269:16"/>
theſe Deſerters, of which he ſent a Squadron (which I believe was the whole Regiment) to ſerve this Campagne in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where they were farther from their Comrades in the Imperial Army, and where the French King thought they would have a leſs mind of deſerting back again: But they found the French Pay ſo much leſs to their Satisfaction than that of the Emperor's, that they were at laſt weary of the French Service, and I believe that moſt of them have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted this Summer from his Army: To which they were much encouraged by the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> who receiv'd them all into his Service, and made a Troup of them, which he added to his Regiment of Dragons; and he generally had a Detachment of them for his Guard, when he went abroad. Their Hungarian Horſes are little, but very ſwift, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a great deal of fatigue; and they themſelves are very dexterous Horſe-men, though they make but an ill Figure on Horſe-back: They have a little Saddle cover'd with Cloth, and a Houſſen, cut like a Swallow's Tail, that hangs very low on both ſides of the Horſes Legs: They ride like the Orientals, very ſhort, with their Knees almoſt to the Pomel of the Saddle; and when they gallop, they raiſe themſelves up, learning forwards with their Heads upon the Horſes Necks: They have round Furr Cups, with a long Head hanging behind their Backs; and Cloaks <hi>a l'antique,</hi> that hang down to their Heels, and the Capes to their Waſte: They have under that, a ſhort Waſtcoat, and their Breeches and Stockings of a piece, and little Ruſſia Leather Boots that come up half way their Legs: They have a very heavy <hi>Sabre,</hi> or Scimiter, which gives an effectual Stroak when it hits; but if they miſs, thoſe that have a light Sword have much the advantage of them, for 'tis then difficult to recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Their Officers have for all Diſtinction, Braſs Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſticking up an end in their Caps, juſt over their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads: They are very good for Purſuits and Parties, and have generally had very good Succeſs in this way againſt the Turks. The <hi>Heydukes</hi> are the Hungarian Foot, dreſs'd the ſame way, except the Cloak. I thought it convenient to give this Deſcription of them, becauſe their Names occurr
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55269:17"/>
 very often in the <hi>Gazettes,</hi> and, it may be, few know what they are, that read it.</p>
               <p>The 12th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fourteen Battalions of the Dutch were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from our Line, to encamp Half a League to the Rear of the Left, to poſſeſs and defend the Paſs of the Abbey of <hi>Linther,</hi> upon the <hi>Geet,</hi> between <hi>Leauwe</hi> and <hi>Tilmont;</hi> which was a very convenient Poſt, not only to defend the Avenues to our Camp, but alſo to incommode the Enemy's Forage. This Detachment was put under the Command of a Dutch Major-General.</p>
               <p>The 13th. the King rid out very early in the Morning, to obſerve the ſeveral Poſts between his Camp and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy's. The King had with him a ſtrong Detachment of Horſe, with which he paſs'd both the <hi>Geets,</hi> and came very near the Enemy's Camp. His Majeſty went over the Ground where we fought laſt Year at <hi>Landen;</hi> which he rid over ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, to obſerve exactly the Field of Battel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned late in the Evening to the Camp. And there ſcarce happen'd a Day all along the Campagne, but that the King rid out towards the Enemy: Such are the Pains and Care His Majeſty takes for the Welfare and Proſperity of the Common Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The 15th. Seven Battalions more were detached to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce the Dutch Foot that had been poſted near the Abbey of <hi>Linther;</hi> theſe were drawn out of our Forces, and put under the Command of Brigadier <hi>Erle:</hi> viz. <hi>Erle, Leſley, Lloyd, Mackay, Meloniere, Jutland,</hi> and <hi>Aver.</hi> The ſame Day, the Dauphin remov'd his Quarter from St. <hi>Tron,</hi> to the Village of St. <hi>Bruſten,</hi> to ſettle here an Hoſpital for the Sick, to be near the Army. The ſame Day, the King had Advice from <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> that no leſs than Four or Five hundred Swiſſers had deſerted the French Army, and were come to that Place. Upon which, Orders were given, That theſe Regiments that wanted Recruits, ſhould ſend an Officer to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> to get them among thoſe Deſerters: Many of them were of <hi>Monim</hi>'s Regiment, which is the ſame as Brigadier <hi>Stouppa</hi> had, that died of the Wounds he receiv'd at the Battel of <hi>Steenkirk.</hi> That <hi>Stouppa</hi> was a Proteſtant, and had been a Miniſter;

               <p>The 16th. the King review'd Sir <hi>Thomas Levingſtom</hi>'s and Colonel <hi>Cunningham</hi>'s Dragons, that had lately come over from <hi>Scotland;</hi> they were canton'd near the Town of <hi>Arſchot.</hi> The ſame Day, the Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> march'd nearer to the Dauphin's Army, and paſſed the <hi>Jecker</hi> at <hi>Warem,</hi> where he encamp'd upon the Left of the French Army. Forty Suiſſe Deſerters more came at the ſame time from the Enemy, and our Detachment brought in ſeveral Priſoners. My Lord <hi>Athlone</hi> came up likewiſe nearer to our Army this ſame Day, and took his Quarter upon the Left, at the Abbey of <hi>Linther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 17th. becauſe <hi>Bouffer</hi>'s had now joyn'd the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin's Army, and that we had only Foot in our Camp (the Horſe being ſtill canton'd in the Neighbourhood) which might have given the French an Occaſion to attack us, 'twas order'd to fortifie our Camp, and to make a Retrenchment from the King's Quarter at the Village of <hi>Rooſeheck,</hi> to that of <hi>Cumtich,</hi> the only Place open in our Camp, the reſt was well covered, (as we have before deſcribed.)</p>
               <p>We ſaid before, that the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> expected ſome of his own Forces, which he had ſent for, to augment his Army this Campagne; they were now come to the Neighbourhood of <hi>Louvain,</hi> and conſiſted of Three Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of Dragons of Count <hi>Philippe d' Areo,</hi> Three of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterol,</hi> Two Squadrons more of Cuiraſſiers of <hi>Weychel,</hi> Two Battalions of his Guards, Two Battalions of <hi>Riviera,</hi> and One of <hi>Horthanſen;</hi> theſe joyn'd the Spaniſh Horſe, and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varian Cuiraſſiers, and made a Body near <hi>Louvain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 18th. they were review'd by the Elector, where the King was invited, and receiv'd with Three Salutes of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and Small-ſhot, and afterwards treated by the Elector.</p>

               <p>The 20th. a great many Deſerters more came from the Enemy; and, indeed, there hardly paſs'd a Day, but there came in ſome of them to our Camp, more or leſs The ſame Day, a Detachment of our Dragons brought in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty ſeven Priſoners: They fired upon the Vanguard, not thinking it had been the whole Detachment; but the reſt rid up immediately, being a ſtrong Detachment, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the Wood, where the French had poſted themſelves in Ambuſcade; and ſo they all yielded themſelves Priſoners of War. At the ſame time, we took Two Dominican Fryers Priſoners, and an Iriſh Prieſt, that were come as Spyes into our Army: A Soldier of the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Guards, that had deſerted to us ſome Days before, and had taken Service in our Engliſh Guards, diſcover'd them: He knew they had paſs'd between both Armies ſeveral times, particularly the two Dominicans, and that they had engaged to debauch as many as they could of our Engliſh Soldiers, to recruit the late King's Regiments in <hi>France;</hi> for which they were to receive a Luy d'ore a Man, for as many as they could bring over. They had an Iriſh Young Man with them; who being preſs'd to confeſs, own'd the Truth, and was afterwards an Evidence againſt them. After being Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, they were Committed Priſoners ſeverally in Tents, at the King's Quarter, and Centries continually ſet over them.</p>
               <p>On the 21ſt. a Detachment of our Foot, poſted at the Abbey of <hi>Linther,</hi> brought in Fourſcore Priſoners; of which, ſome of them were Genſd'arms, and of the French King's Life-guards. The Detachment, from this Poſt, did very much incommode the French Army; and they ſeldom had a Forage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, but that they brought in ſeveral Priſoners.</p>

 The 22nd. the King review'd Brigadier <hi>Matthews</hi> and the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Dragons, which had come up to the Camp the Day before. Brigadier <hi>Matthews</hi>'s Regiment encamped on the other ſide of the Village of <hi>Cumtich,</hi> which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Retrenchment, to cover Monſieur <hi>d' Auverquerque</hi>'s, and other General Officers Quarters there. My Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi>'s Dragons encamped without the Defiles of the Village of <hi>Rooſebeck,</hi> to cover the King's Quarter on that ſide. The ſame Day, ſeveral of the Enemy's Squadrons came in ſight of our Camp, in the Plain on the other ſide of <hi>Tilmont.</hi> Upon which, the Major of the ſeveral Regiments upon the Right, had Orders to come to take the Poſts of their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Retrenchment, in caſe the French ſhould come and attack us; and to ſee if the Retrenchments of their ſeveral Poſts were well made, with a good defenſible Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. I forgot to ſay, That the Town of <hi>Tilmont</hi> (the Dutch call it <hi>Tienen)</hi> which in this Camp was, before, the Left of our Army, was guarded by a Detachment of Three hundred Men, under the Command of a Field-Officer, and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers proportionably, which relieved one another every other Day: It is ſituated upon the greater <hi>Geet,</hi> which comes from <hi>Judoigne,</hi> and has ſeveral petty Cloyſters and publick Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in it, with an old decayed Wall, and ruin'd Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about it: There is no Water near it, but the little River <hi>Geet,</hi> and 'tis commanded by the Countrey about it; for which reaſon, 'tis not capable of any good Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>The 24th. One of the French King's Carabiners deſerted, and came to our Army: And the ſame Day we brought in Eight Priſoners; and an Engliſh Officer that was a Lieutenant in the Duke <hi>de Chartres</hi> his Regiment of Foot, and has ſerved many Years in the French Army; the reſt of his Party made their eſcape, and ſome of them were wounded. This Day, the Spaniſh and Bavarian Forces left the Neighbourhood of <hi>Louvain,</hi> and march'd up along the River <hi>Dyle,</hi> as far as <hi>Neer Iſche.</hi> The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> left <hi>Bruſſels</hi> at the ſame time, to come and Head his Army in this Place: (I ſhall reſerve the <hi>Liſt</hi> of theſe Forces, till we bring them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

 at the Camp of Mount St. <hi>Andre:</hi> His Brother, the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> accompany'd him the moſt part of this Campagne, being <hi>incognito</hi> in the Field; ſo that no Honours were paid to him by the Army. The ſame Day, Ten Drums, all of the Regiment of <hi>Piemont,</hi> deſerted together, and came in their Livery-Coats to our Camp.</p>
               <p>The 25th. we worked again at the Retrenchment, to make ſome of the Breaſt-works higher, which were found too low: and yet as bad as they were, I heard ſeveral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers ſay, that they were infinitely better than thoſe we had laſt Year at <hi>Landen,</hi> which were made up haſtily in one Night; ſo that they could only ſerve to hinder Horſe from riding into our Camp, but not cover our Men either from Cannon or Small-ſhot; a Man could eaſily have jump'd over them, Ditch and all: And yet theſe were call'd, by ſome, (to magnifie the Victory) Formidable Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The 26th. the Regiments of <hi>Marton</hi> and <hi>Fuhnen</hi> were ſent to reinforce <hi>Matthews</hi> his Dragons, to cover the Village of <hi>Cumtich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 27th. the Enemy made a great Forage hard by <hi>Leauwe;</hi> and becauſe they were to come very near our Camp, and to forage juſt under the Garriſon of <hi>Leauwe,</hi> they had a ſtrong Detachment of Twelve hundred Horſe, and Six Pieces of Cannon, which the Dauphin Commanded himſelf in Perſon, to take this Opportunity of viewing the Poſts between the two Armies and the Field of Battle where we fought laſt Year at <hi>Landen.</hi> The Enemy foraged ſo near the Garriſon of <hi>Leauwe,</hi> this Day, that they fired Cannon upon them, to oblige them to retire; but Seventy of their Maroders were made Priſoners by a Detachment of ours upon the Left. (When the Soldiers go out of the Camp to gather Roots, Fruits, or Pulſe, or, it may be, to Plunder the Boors, this is call'd <hi>Maroding.)</hi>

               <p>The 28th. in the Evening, we heard a firing of Cannon and Small-ſhot in the French Camp; which we gueſs'd to be for the Reduction of <hi>Gironne,</hi> in <hi>Catalonia:</hi> Of which we were inform'd the next Day. The French were ſo much the more glad for this Conqueſt, becauſe that in 1684. the Mareſchal <hi>de Belfonds</hi> ſuffered a Diſgrace before this Place, and was forc'd to raiſe the Siege, when he had made a Breach in the Place; and that his Forces, in a general Aſſault, had got into it, but were beaten out again with a great ſlaughter by the Beſieged, that had fortified themſelves in the Parade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place.

               <p>The 29th. our Parties brought in Two hundred and fifty French Maroders. We had taken ſo many Priſoners by this time, that the Provoſts Guard, and Gaols of the neighbouring Towns, were full of them, though the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>de Luxemburg</hi> had them reclaimed as faſt as he could: Their Pay is ſo ſmall, and, for this Twelve-month paſt, ſo ill receiv'd, that their Soldiers could not ſubſiſt, but by what they could gather in the Country: ſo that they were forced to tollerate the Soldiers going out of the Camp, to get where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to live. This is the reaſon that ſo many fell into the hands of our Parties, and that we took ſo many Priſoners: And though the French are more given to Deſerting than any other Soldiers, yet Deſerting was never ſo much known among them, as 'twas at the Beginning of this Campagne, not only in <hi>Flanders,</hi> but upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and in <hi>Piemont,</hi> where they all unanimouſly complained of their want of Pay; ſo far, that by this time 'twas computed, that above Five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them had deſerted from their Army here, either to our Camp, or to the Garriſons of <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> ſince

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="July."/> The 1ſt. of this Month, the French Army left their Camp at St. <hi>Tron</hi> and <hi>Bruſten,</hi> and marched towards the <hi>Jaar</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and encamp'd with their Right at <hi>Tongres,</hi> and the Left at <hi>Fies,</hi> along the <hi>Jaar,</hi> which was in their Rear: The Dauphin took his Quarter at <hi>Oerle,</hi> upon the ſame River: They had made great Preparations at <hi>Huy,</hi> of Bombs, Battering-Pieces, and all other Neceſſaries for a Siege; which now they had brought to their Camp, and gave out, That they deſigned to Bombard <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht:</hi> And ſome were not content with this, but would have a Formal Siege to one of theſe Places. But though the French had heavy Cannon and Mortar-pieces brought to their Camp, yet they had Bridges laid along the <hi>Jaar,</hi> to paſs that River: Which ſhews, That they were more afraid of being attack'd by us, than of having any real Deſign to fall upon us.</p>
               <p>We had above Forty Battalions in the Lines of <hi>Liege,</hi> and a good Garriſon in <hi>Maeſtricht<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and our own Army conſiſted now of Ninety Battalions, after the arrival of the Two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of <hi>Wolfembuttel</hi> to our Camp: And if the French had not been cover'd by ſo many Rivers, which we muſt have paſs'd to come at them, they had run a great riſque of having been attack'd on all ſides by our Army, and the <hi>Liege</hi> Forces; but the Nature of the Country gave Opportunity to the French of advancing ſo near to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> having Rivers on all ſides between them and us, and between them and the Forces encamped in the Lines of <hi>Liege:</hi> And beſides, there was a neceſſity of ſuffering the Enemy to conſume the Forage about <hi>Liege,</hi> for Reaſons that we ſhall mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. However, the French made a great Noiſe of their Foraging under the Cannon of <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 4th. the two Dominican Fryers, and the Iriſh Prieſt, that had been taken up in our Army for Spyes, were ſet at Liberty: The two firſt were found Guilty by the Court-Marſhal, and Sentenc'd to Die: After which Judgment of the Court, they were removed from the King's Quarters to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55269:22"/>
the Provoſt's, and laid in Irons: But the King Pardon'd them, out of his pure Mercy, (for the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> would have had them Hang'd,) and ſent them to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Malines,</hi> to have that Town for a Priſon, during the War. But the Iriſh Prieſt alledg'd, That he was going to his own Countrey; That he took only the Opportunity of the two Fryers Company to come to our Camp, and ſo to go for <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which appearing to be Truth, he was Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, and ſet this Day at Liberty.</p>
               <p>The 7th. Lieutenant-General <hi>Dewits,</hi> that Commanded the Brandenburgh Forces that we left at <hi>Diest,</hi> march'd to joyn the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> at the Camp of <hi>Neer-Iſche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 10th. the King review'd My Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier <hi>Wynne</hi>'s Dragons; the latter wanted Two Troops that had been left in <hi>England,</hi> and his Horſes very much fatigu'd in twice croſſing the Sea the laſt Winter, and their continual Motion thorough <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to come over to this Countrey. My Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s appear'd in very good Condition and Order. The ſame Day, Two Iriſh Officers left the French Army, and came over to us; one of them had been in the late Queen's Regiment, and the other in Colonel <hi>Talbot</hi>'s, both of them in <hi>Savoy.</hi> And Prince <hi>Vademont,</hi> that had come Poſt from <hi>Italy,</hi> to make the Campagne in <hi>Flanders,</hi> came to Salute the King at his Arrival. His Majeſty receiv'd him with a great deal of Joy, and with the greateſt Demonſtration of Friendſhip. He is a very Wiſe General, and has been with the King in all his Campagnes (except the laſt, that he was in <hi>Italy)</hi> both in the former and this preſent War, and is very zealous and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate for His Majeſty's Intereſt. Orders were given, this Day, to be ready to March.</p>
               <p>The 11th. One of our Parties came to the Camp with a Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, Major, and two Captains, and ſeveral Soldiers, which they had taken in the Paſſage-Barge between <hi>Namurr</hi> and <hi>Huy:</hi> The Officers were treated very civilly in our Camp, eſpecially the Colonel, who had the liberty of his Sword, and to ride with the Army in the

 following March, to have a full View of it: With which he was very much pleas'd.</p>
               <p>The 12th. the Battalions we had poſted upon the Left, near the Abbey of <hi>Linther,</hi> left that Place to come up to the Army, to be in a readineſs to March: And the Seven Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions under the Command of Brigadier <hi>Erle,</hi> encamp'd upon the Right, upon the Ground that remain'd between it and the Village of <hi>Rooſebeek,</hi> which cover'd the King's Quarter. Some Squadrons of Horſe had encamp'd here at the beginning; but upon the making of the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they were ſent back to the Village, for their more convenient Subſiſtence. This ſame Day, Major-General <hi>la Forreſt</hi> was ſent with a great Detachment of Horſe, to obſerve the Enemy; and Orders were given to load all the heavy Baggage, and to march that Night without any precedent Beat of Drum, but to take our Motions from the Right.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the 13th. by One of the Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Army began to March upon ſeveral Columns. The Firſt conſiſted of the Brigade of Guards, and the Seven Regiments that had been detached under Brigadier <hi>Erle:</hi> This Column was led by the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and Count <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and paſſed the <hi>Geet</hi> between <hi>Tilmont</hi> and <hi>Judoigne.</hi> The Two Lines had the General Officers upon their reſpective Diviſions, and the Firſt march'd thorough <hi>Tilmont,</hi> by the Gate of <hi>Louvain,</hi> out of the Gate of <hi>Judoigne.</hi> The Second march'd thorough the Town, by the Gate that leads to <hi>Leauwe,</hi> and went out by the Gate of St. <hi>Tron.</hi> The Artillery and Baggage follow'd the Column led by the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg.</hi> Very early in the Morning we were got on the other ſide of the Town, into the Plain; which made room enough to ſubdivide the Two Lines into Six Columns, for a more ſpeedy and convenient March. The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> march'd at the ſame time from his Camp at <hi>Neer-Iſche,</hi> to joyn us this Day; and all the Cavalry had the ſame Orders. We made a long March between the two <hi>Geets,</hi> and by the Town of <hi>Judoigne,</hi> towards the <hi>Mehaigne:</hi> And though we owe all the following Advantages of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55269:23"/>
to this Camp, and that we made no Secret of our March, (for, as we ſaid juſt now, Orders had been given two Days before, to be ready to March,) yet the French did not think it convenient to hazard a Pattle, to diſpute this Camp; which, it may be, was the King's Deſign, by making no Secret of his March.</p>
               <p>We made a Halt about <hi>Judoigne,</hi> to ſtay for the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Forces, which were to paſs the <hi>Geet</hi> here; and about the Evening, the Right of our Army got to the <hi>Mahaigne.</hi> The Quarter-Maſters had remain'd in this March with the Army, becauſe the Ground we were going to, could have been diſputed by the Enemy; and ſo we mark'd our Lines, after we were come up to our Ground. The King's Quarter was mark'd, in the Order of the March, at <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male;</hi> and the Elector's, at <hi>Tav<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Line made a ſmall kind of an Elbow by the Village of <hi>Henieux Heddin,</hi> which we had here in our Front; the Right of this Camp was a Plain, and the Left went into narrow and cloſe Grounds. All the Cavalry joyn'd us here.</p>

               <p>You muſt obſerve that at firſt coming to the Camp of Mount St. <hi>André,</hi> all the Dragoons incamped upon the Left, where the Left is the Poſt of Honour: 'Tis for this Reaſon that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dragoons in this Liſt fall after the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Our Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery conſiſted of Sixty pieces of Cannon and ſix Mortars, and four Companies of Gunners and Matroſſes, and one of Miners, each of one hundred men. The Artillery was commanded by Colonel <hi>Goor,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Brown,</hi> and Major <hi>Slondt;</hi> and the four Companies of Gunners and Matroſſes which carry Fire-Armes, were commanded by the Captains, <hi>Watſon, Cock, Vanderſtam</hi> and <hi>Leſley.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> Artillery conſiſted of the ſame ſtrength both in reſpect of Cannon and Men.</p>
               <p>It appears by this Liſt of our Line of Battle at Mount St. <hi>André,</hi> that our Army conſiſted in the Right and Left Wing, of 176 Squadrons of Horſe, which at 150 Horſe each Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron at our firſt coming into the Field, makes 26400 Horſe; the Reſerve conſiſted of 54 Squadrons of Dragoons, 100 each Squadron, which is our complement, which makes 5400
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55269:29"/>
Dragoons; by which the total of our Horſe and Dragoons amounted to 31800 Men, all very well Mounted and Armed; but of the Dragoons eſpecially I may ſay, That ſuch a Body, either for Number or the good Order they were in, has hardly ever been in the Field. Our Infantry conſiſted of 63 Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in the body of Foot, 20 interlined in the Right Wing of Horſe, and 12 in the Left, which in all makes 95 Battalions, which at 600 each Battalion at firſt coming into the Field, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to 51000 Foot and 31800 Horſe, which makes the total ſumme of our Army at Mount St. <hi>André</hi> to be 88800 Men, and about 7000 which Count <hi>Thian</hi> had incamped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command near <hi>Ghendt,</hi> of which we have given an account before, which being added to the former ſumme, amounts to 95800 Men. This is all we had now in the Field. 'Tis true that we had a great many Forces in <hi>Liege,</hi> of which I ſhall give an account to the Reader hereafter. But that Town being then our Frontier, it required an Army for a Gariſon; and the condition of affairs in regard of that City did then require our ſpecial care for its ſafety; ſo that what Forces we had in <hi>Liege</hi> at that time were uſeleſs as to the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offenſively; whilſt the Enemy were between us and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> with as good an Army in the Field as ours, except what it had ſuffered by deſerters; for by our computation of the <hi>French</hi> Forces above, it appears that they had here and in <hi>Flanders</hi> 91320 Men, which was but 4480 Men leſs than we had in the Field in both theſe places, which in ſuch a number is no great odds: I put it therefore to the Judgment of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Men, whether the <hi>French</hi> were not in a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to act defenſively againſt us this year, than we to have acted defenſively againſt them in the former Campaigns.</p>
               <p>We diſpos'd our Field-Pieces this March to mount to St. <hi>André</hi> upon the head of the Several Brigades of Foot, each Brigade had Five Field-Pieces, with Stores and Gunners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably. The Day following, Count <hi>Alefeldt</hi> was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd with his Brigade to the Village of <hi>Ramelies,</hi> which the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> left to take his Quarter at <hi>Taviers</hi> upon the <hi>Mahaigne,</hi> and this Poſt was committed to the Charge of Major General <hi>Ellenberg.</hi> We made a Retrenchment about
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55269:29"/>
                  <hi>Ramelies,</hi> and placed a great many pieces of Canon upon the height of this Village which commanded the Plain that leads to <hi>Huy.</hi> The ſame day we rectified our Camp, which had been mark'd in haſte the day before to make the Line more regular, and filled up the Interval that had been left by <hi>Alefeldt</hi>'s Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade. The <hi>French</hi> being adviſed of our March towards the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> left this day their Camp between <hi>Tongres</hi> and <hi>Fies,</hi> and marched near to <hi>Huy,</hi> after they had paſſed the <hi>Jaar</hi> upon ſeveral Bridges; they imcamped with their Right between the Villages of <hi>Vignamont</hi> and <hi>Walef</hi> towards the <hi>Jaar,</hi> and their Left at <hi>Fenmale</hi> upon the <hi>Mehaigne.</hi> The Dauphin took his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at <hi>Vignamont,</hi> within Two Engliſh Miles of <hi>Huy;</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> which before made a ſhew of having ſome deſign upon <hi>Liege</hi> or <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> now did not think themſelves ſecure enough in the Camp of <hi>Vignamont,</hi> though ſtrong by Situation between the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the <hi>Jaar,</hi> and <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> but immediately upon their coming to this Camp they fortified it where it was open, between the <hi>Jaar</hi> and the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> with a very good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment, which they made as ſtrong as art and leaſure could do it. The Right of our own Camp, upon the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> was within Two Leagues and a half of <hi>Namur,</hi> and within Four Engliſh Miles of the <hi>Meuſe:</hi> for which reaſon the <hi>French</hi> kept their Communications with <hi>Namur,</hi> from whence they had their Proviſions by Land on the other ſide of the River, which before they had by Water; and the Marquiſs <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> which before lay incamped between the <hi>Paijs de Liege</hi> and that of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> was ordered to come and Poſt himſelf on the other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> near <hi>Huy,</hi> to cover the <hi>French</hi> Convoys, which otherwiſe would have been much expoſed to the Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Garriſon of <hi>Liege,</hi> which has an equal advantage on both ſides of the River: And becauſe the <hi>French</hi> were now every much ſtreightned in their Camp, that they had already forraged all about <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and that there remained but little Ground on this ſide of the River which they could forrage ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely on; the Dauphin, to provide for the ſubſiſtance of his Army as long as he could, ordered all the heavy Baggage of the Army to march by <hi>Huy</hi> to the other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> This was the great Advantage of our Camp at <hi>Mount St. André,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:55269:30"/>
That the <hi>French,</hi> which before ravaged all the Countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> were now forced to Retrench them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Walls of their own Garriſon of <hi>Huy;</hi> and that it put all the Countrey on this ſide of the <hi>Sambre</hi> under our Command, ſo far, that the <hi>French,</hi> though Maſters both of <hi>Namur</hi> and <hi>Charleroy,</hi> yet could not hinder us from incamping in the Plains of <hi>Fleury,</hi> and were themſelves forced to paſs and re-paſs the <hi>Sambre,</hi> which is a great way about, to follow us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Flanders.</hi> And though our Advantages were ſo great by this Camp, yet we could not take it up ſooner, becauſe the <hi>French</hi> might then have ſubſiſted about <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Huy</hi> longer than we could have done upon the <hi>Mehaigne;</hi> which would have expoſed <hi>Liege</hi> too much to the <hi>French</hi> Power, upon our March to the <hi>Scheld.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 16th. <hi>Stuarts</hi> Brigade was detached out of the Line to incamp at the <hi>Cenſe,</hi> or Farm of <hi>Franquenies,</hi> near the Abbey of <hi>Bonef</hi> upon the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> where they intrenched themſelves, and the Guard of this Poſt was committed to the charge of Count <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Lieutenant General. This Village, with that of <hi>Ramelies</hi> on the other ſide, Commanded the Plain before our Right Wing, (where we incamped along the <hi>Mehaigne</hi> in the Campagne of 1692. where the King had his Quarter at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies,</hi> and our Right by <hi>Perwys,</hi> and the Left at <hi>Brancon</hi> upon the <hi>Mehaigne:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> were then beſieging the Caſtle of <hi>Namur,)</hi> the reſt of our Camp was covered in the Front by the <hi>Leſſer,</hi> and in the Rear by the <hi>Greater Geet:</hi> The River in the Front was a great way from the Line, above half of a League, but a little Brook covered it nearer that went from the Village of <hi>Offus</hi> and fell into the <hi>Leſſer Geet</hi> at <hi>Jauche.</hi> This was the Strength and Situation of our Camp at <hi>Mount St. André,</hi> the Poſts that covered, and the Advantages we got by it.</p>
               <p>Upon our coming to this Camp, and the <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Vignamont,</hi> the King ordered the Forces that were incamped within the Lines of <hi>Liege,</hi> to march out, and form a Camp by the Citadel, conſiſting of <hi>Dutch, Brandenbourg,</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> Forces, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Prince <hi>Circlaes</hi> of <hi>Tilly,</hi> and the Major-General <hi>Heyden,</hi> and <hi>Cohorne.</hi> This was a very convenient Camp to moleſt the Enemy in their Forrage towards <hi>Liege;</hi> and the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55269:30"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> to be even with us, Commanded a ſmall Body of Horfe and Dragoons, Commanded by Colonel <hi>Vaillat,</hi> to incamp un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Walls of <hi>Namur</hi> to moleſt our Forragers between the <hi>Mehaigne</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> who often went very near <hi>Namur:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> ſent beſides this Detachment, a Man of a Company Commanded by the Officers, that had beſt knowledge of the Countrey, to go out in Parties; in which they had pretty good ſucceſs, particularly between the <hi>Mehaigne</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> where we loſt ſeveral Horſes, and they took generally ſome Priſoners. But if theſe were inconvenient to us from <hi>Namur,</hi> our Camp near <hi>Liege</hi> was equally inconvenient to the Enemy on that ſide from whom they took a great many Horſes and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; but few Deſerters came to us from this Camp, though they deſerted before in Multitudes, becauſe they were ſo cloſely intrenched between Rivers that it was difficult for them, who had a mind, to get away.</p>
               <p>The 17th. the King rid out very early, with a ſtrong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of 4000 Horſe, along the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> towards the Enemies Camp, and returned very late that Evening: The day following we had a general Forrage on the other ſide the <hi>Mehaign.</hi> Several of the Enemies Squadrons appeared in ſight of our Forragers; for which reaſon we fired three Pieces of Cannon from our Camp, the Signal to call them in. The <hi>French</hi> did forrage the ſame day on their ſide, and theſe Squadrons were of the Detachment to Cover the Forragers, who were no leſs ſurpriſed to ſee ſome of our Squadrons poſted near them for the ſame reaſon; however there was no Action on either Side, though ſuch Accidents falling out have ſometimes brought two Armies to an ingagement, as it happened in 1689 at <hi>Walcourt,</hi> between Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> and the Mareſchal <hi>de Humieres.</hi> Our Foragers nevertheleſs made a ſhift not to come into the Camp empty, but we loſt ſome Horſes that tarried too long after the Signal given to come off, at which time the Detachment that cover'd the Foragers were commanded back to the Camp. Colonel <hi>Mathews</hi> loſt 8 Horſes out of his Regiment, and 3 of his Men were wounded.</p>
               <p>The 22<hi>th</hi> all the Dragoons removed from the Left to the Rear of the Right by <hi>Hottemont:</hi> What remained of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55269:31"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Artillery after the Field-pieces had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into the ſeveral Brigades of Foot, and that we had planted ſome others at the Village of <hi>Ramelies,</hi> came to be poſted here the day before from the ground between Mount St. <hi>André</hi> and <hi>Bonmale,</hi> where it had incamped at our firſt coming here. And the 24<hi>th</hi> the Duke of St. <hi>Albans</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Lutterel</hi> came to the Camp from <hi>England;</hi> the firſt to ſerve as a Voluntier, and the ſecond to go to <hi>Venice</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces in the Service of that Republick, with a Commiſſion of Major-General. This day we had another general Forage towards <hi>Wavre,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Rivers,</hi> loſt ſome Horſes out of his Troop of Guards. The Parties not only from <hi>Namur,</hi> but from <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Charleroy,</hi> were very frequent, and came often to the very Rear of our Camp; ſo that upon a Forage, 'twas very hard to prevent the loſing ſeveral of our Horſes, either by negligent Men who did not take care to keep within the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards; or others, who for choice of Forage would venture beyond them.</p>
               <p>The 26<hi>th</hi> we ſurrounded a party of the Enemies in a Wood, juſt by the Rear of our Left, where they had been decoy'd by a Boor, who gave notice of it to my Lord of <hi>Athlone.</hi> This was a voluntary Party of diſmounted Troopers that had a great mind to ride ſome of our Horſes, and to mount them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at our own coſt; they got a Partiſan with them, who when they came near to our Camp inquir'd whereabouts our Horſes grazed; the Boor told them, that they were every day juſt by the Wood, and that if they would lie there in ambuſcade that night they would not fail of Horſes the next morning: They took his advice, and the Boor came immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to advertiſe my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> of it, who commanded a Detachment of Dragoons and of the two Brigades of Foot interlined in the Left to ſurround the Wood, and to give no quarter; ſo that they kill'd 20 of them up and down, and the Partiſan among the reſt; but at laſt they gave quarter to 17. Much about the ſame time one of our Parties, compoſed of Soldiers of <hi>Hukelom</hi> and <hi>Carles</hi> Regiments, brought in the Lieutenant-Colonel of the <hi>Dauphins</hi> Regiment, and ſeveral
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55269:31"/>
other Priſoners, which they took between <hi>Huy</hi> and <hi>Namur.</hi> And though 'tis none of my buſineſs to ſpeak of the actions of Parties and Partiſans, which have no more to do in the main buſineſs of an Army, than Privateers have in that of a Fleet, the one being upon Land what the others are at Sea, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit to ſpeak of a conſiderable adventure of one of our Parties, which ventured to paſs the <hi>Meuſe</hi> though not 30 Men, and got about 50 Troopers in a defile, where they took all their Horſes, and made every one of them Priſoners, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd the <hi>Meuſe</hi> with their Booty, which they brought ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly off.</p>
               <p>The 21<hi>th</hi> Count <hi>Thian</hi> had a quiet Camp in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Ghendt,</hi> where he ſeemed poſted only to make head againſt the Marquis <hi>De la Valette</hi> near <hi>Courtray,</hi> yet he would not remain idle there, but about this time he made a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 300 <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe out of his Camp, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Lieutenant-Colonel of the Prince of <hi>Chinays</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, who in their way by <hi>Aeth</hi> took a Reinforcement of 700 Foot out of that Gariſon, and the next day they were joyn'd with about 3 or 400 more of the ſame Gariſon: Theſe Forces attack'd the <hi>French</hi> Line about St. <hi>Ghilain,</hi> and forced ſeveral of their Redoubts upon the <hi>Haine,</hi> where they made 50 Priſoners; they paſs'd the River after this, and plundered the Town of St. <hi>Ghilain,</hi> where there was a ſmall Gariſon which abandon'd it upon their approach, and retreated to <hi>Mons;</hi> they detach'd ſeveral Parties in the Countrey round about for Hoſtages, and made a very great booty of Horſes and Cattle which they brought to <hi>Aeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 27<hi>th</hi> the three Battalions of Guards in the Second Line, had Orders to incamp upon the Kings Quarter, a great deal of baggage of the Kings Horſe, and ſeveral, both Mules and Horſes were on the other ſide of the little River which went under the Kings Quarter; and the King had information of the deſigns of ſome of the <hi>French</hi> Partiſans to come and endeavour to ſteal away what lay on the other ſide of this River, where it was expos'd to ſuch attempts; and beſides the Kings Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was removed from the Line of the Army, for which reaſon theſe three Battalions of Guards, and the Duke of <hi>Holſteins</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:55269:32"/>
Dragoons incamped here by the Kings Quarter, the Guards on the other, and the Dragoons on this ſide of the <hi>Geet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 28<hi>th</hi> we had another general Forage, under a good eſcort of 20 Squadrons of Horſe commanded by Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> Major-General, and a good Detachment of Foot commanded by Brigadier <hi>Collier.</hi> Some Horſes were loſt of Brigadier <hi>Mathews</hi> his Dragoons, and two of his Men were kill'd by the <hi>French</hi> Parties that lay in ambuſcade for a like occaſion.</p>
               <p>The 31<hi>th</hi> the King took a review of the 20 <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Squadrons of Horſe that (as we ſaid above) had joyn'd the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> at his Camp of <hi>Neer Iſthe,</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Lieutenant-General <hi>D' Witz</hi> and Major-General <hi>Sonsfeldt<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Intervals had been left for them in ſeveral Brigades at our coming to this Camp, which they fill'd up at their arrival; ſo that their coming did not alter the Line of Battle above ſpecified; they are only called <hi>Saxon</hi> Regiments in the Liſt, but their Names were <hi>Rebauld, Bernickow</hi> and <hi>Penhauſen,</hi> the fourth I have forgot. The States have hired them for their ſervice from the Elector of <hi>Saxony;</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they had made a long march to come ſo ſoon to the Camp from their Country, yet they appeared in good order.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55269:32"/>
have before alledged. A Man out of a Company was likewiſe detach'd for the ſecurity of the Baggage, under the command of a Captain, Lieutenant and Enſign, out of each Brigade, and the whole was commanded by Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, and Major.</p>
               <p>By this time Forage began to be very ſcarce in both Armies, which were very numerous, and yet had now been above two Months in and about the <hi>Pajis de Liege.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> had been in it from the very beginning of the Campaign, and now had liberty of Forage but between the <hi>Meuſe</hi> and the <hi>Jaar,</hi> for that part of the Principality of <hi>Liege</hi> which lies on the other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> call'd the <hi>Condros,</hi> affords but little Forage; 'tis a Woody Country, and part of the Foreſt <hi>d' Ardenne</hi> abounds in Coal-pits, which makes firing very cheap about this Country. The <hi>French</hi> for want of Forage on this ſide the <hi>Meuſe</hi> were forced to ſend their Horſes to feed on the other, having beſides the paſſage at <hi>Huy</hi> ſeveral Bridges upon the <hi>Meuſe</hi> for that purpoſe. I ſaw a Letter about this time from a Gentleman in the <hi>French</hi> Army to his Friend, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this Camp of <hi>Vignamont,</hi> wherein he complained for want of Forage, and that they wiſh'd very much for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping, that they might have the liberty of going to a more plentiful Camp. As we have given a hint of it before, there was a reaſon to bring the Army to this want of Forage on both ſides in this Country, becauſe the King deſign'd to bring his Army into <hi>Flanders</hi> to make room for the undertaking that has cloſed up this Campaign. <hi>Liege</hi> was our Frontier Town, which required an Army for its Gariſon, and the <hi>French</hi> being Maſters of <hi>Huy,</hi> they could not only incommode <hi>Liege</hi> very much, but march and ſubſiſt with their Army as far as <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht,</hi> as we have ſeen this Campaign; ſo that above all things, 'twas neceſſary to drive the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Huy,</hi> and eſtabliſh our Frontier there: But if we had march'd towards <hi>Flanders</hi> without conſuming firſt the Forage all over this Country, and without obliging the <hi>French</hi> themſelves to help us in it; upon our removal from this Camp, and our march towards the <hi>Scheld,</hi> they might have fallen upon <hi>Liege,</hi> and our great Towns in <hi>Brabant,</hi> which would have been as good for them

               <p>The 5<hi>th,</hi> 240 <hi>Suiſſe</hi> Deſerters were ſent from <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> to the Camp to recruit the <hi>Suiſſe</hi> Regiments we had in our Army.</p>
               <p>The 6<hi>th</hi> an Order from the King was publiſhed at the head of every Regiment, to forbid Foraging without order, to go on Maroding, or to moleſt Victuallers, or any perſons that came to the Camp with Proviſions, upon pain of death. For what moſt deſtroys and ruines a Country are theſe interloping Foragers and Maroders, who not only augment the ſcarceneſs in a Camp by plundering the Country people round about, but often fall into the Enemies hands, whereby we loſe our Horſes, and our Men are made Priſoners.</p>
               <p>The 7<hi>th</hi> the Army had orders to be ready to march, and the Artillery and Pontons were ſent this day as far as <hi>Perwys,</hi> under the Eſcorte of the Regiment of <hi>Fuknen</hi> or green <hi>Danes.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> expected our march, for which reaſon they fired ſeveral pieces of Cannon from <hi>Huy</hi> to call in all their Horſes from the other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> We had a report that the <hi>French</hi> had abandon'd it, and that what we heard was the blowing up of the Works, which appeared afterwards to be a ſtory; though I believe the <hi>French</hi> had once a deſign of doing it, becauſe the week before they had ſent moſt of the Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Stores from thence by water to <hi>Namur,</hi> but upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoughts they found the place of ſuch conſequence to us, that they reſolved to uſe their power to keep it if poſſible out of our hands. The <hi>French</hi> upon the news of our march, which they expected this day, ſent ſeveral Parties and Detachments out of the Gariſon of <hi>Namur,</hi> to obſerve the Flanks of our Columns upon the march, and take Priſoners or Baggage if they could find any ſtragling from the Lines: But becauſe we did not march, our Detachments were not yet drawn off from the other ſide of the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> ſo that ſeveral of the <hi>French</hi> fell into their hands, who were made Priſoners; among the reſt, a Captain of Horſe of the Regiment of <hi>Tournelle.</hi> This

Evening orders were given to march the next day, and though we had a Defile to paſs between the <hi>Mehaigne</hi> and <hi>Perwys,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> might have the opportunity of attacking our Rear-guard the next day; nevertheleſs we did not uſe any means to conceal our march from the Enemy; it may be to intice them out of their Retrenchments at <hi>Vignamont</hi> to fall upon our Rear-guard, and to ingage them to a Battle, for our Rear guard was very well prepared to receive them.</p>
               <p>The 8<hi>th</hi> the Army decamped very early from Mount St. <hi>André,</hi> and directed its march towards the ſpring of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haigne</hi> and <hi>Gemblours</hi> paſſing by the Defile of <hi>Perwys</hi> My Lord <hi>Portland</hi> had the Rear-guard, compoſed of a good body of Horſe, and the Brigade of <hi>Stuart</hi> and <hi>Alſeldt</hi> of Foot, which had been poſted at <hi>Franquenies</hi> upon the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> and ſome Field-pieces The King kept with the Rear guard till he ſaw it free from any attempts of the Enemy, where the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Country did afford them an occaſion to have fallen upon it. We made a long march this day, and the weather being warm made ſeveral Soldiers ſaint under their Armes. The King took his Quarter at the <hi>Chateau</hi> of <hi>Sombref,</hi> our Right went towards <hi>Fleury</hi> at St. <hi>Amand,</hi> from whence it turned back almoſt in a right Angle to <hi>Marbais,</hi> where the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had his Quarter, and our Left went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Gemblours</hi> as far as the <hi>Cenſe</hi> or Farm of <hi>Bretinchamp.</hi> The Kings Quarter being in the Front of the Army, was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Dragoons, who incamped before it upon a Line. The Enemy being ſenſible that they could not hinder us from this Camp, and expecting our march to this place, had ordered the ſmall body of Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons commanded by Colonel <hi>Vaillac</hi> from <hi>Namur,</hi> to march to <hi>Charleroy,</hi> both to cover that place, and to incommode our Foragers. We halted here the next day; we had made a long march, and the Rear-guard could not come up till two or three of the Clock in the Morning, and beſides it was neceſſary to ſee what the <hi>French</hi> would do upon this march; whether they would go back to <hi>Liege,</hi> and endeavour to fall upon it, (though the want of Forage could not allow them to ſubſiſt there any longer) or whether they would follow us, and march
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55269:34"/>
upon the <hi>Sambre:</hi> For if they had been obſtinate, to have kept on this ſide of the River, then the Plain of <hi>Fleury</hi> was a very convenient place to try the Iſſue of another Battle, and the odds were not ſo great between the two Armies, but that the <hi>French</hi> (if they depend ſo much on their boaſted Bravery) might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well have ventured it. The Enemy out-did us in Foot by Two Battalions, as it appears by the Liſt of their Line of Battle and ours, but we out-numbered them in Horſe and Dragoons; however it appeared by the Enemies behaviour at this time, that they depend more upon the Number than the Bravery and Valour of their Soldiers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> had ſo many reports of our marching the day before, in which they were deceived, that though we made no ſecret of this days march, yet they were not certain of it till about Noon; their Right Wing of Horſe was then gone to forrage: The Dauphin cauſed ſeveral Pieces of Cannon to be fired to call them in; the Reſolution was taken to follow us, and the Drums immediately beat the General to give notice of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. About Four in the Afternoon the Dauphin began to move with the Right Wing of Horſe and Body of Foot, and paſſed the <hi>Mehaigne</hi> at <hi>Falay,</hi> directing their March up along the <hi>Meuſe</hi> towards <hi>Namur.</hi> The Right Wing of Horſe, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> being returned from their Forrage, followed the Dauphin about Eight that Evening, and ſo they marched all Night and the next day, that they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Evening between <hi>Spy</hi> and <hi>Maſey,</hi> and the Dauphin took his Quarter at the <hi>Chateau de Soye</hi> upon the <hi>Sambre;</hi> but in leaving the Camp of <hi>Vignamont,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> provided for the ſafety of <hi>Huy,</hi> and left a Battalion to reinforce the Garriſon. When they were come up to this Camp, we could diſcover part of their Left, but the little River that runs from <hi>Gemblours</hi> into the <hi>Sambre</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them, and remained between us: However though we were ſo near one another, and that the Plains of <hi>Fleury</hi> offered a very convenient field of battle, yet the <hi>French</hi> were unwilling to hazard it, but rather reſolved to make a Retreat, and paſs the <hi>Sambre;</hi> which they began that very Night: The Infantry of the Kings Houſe led the way, and the next day the whole Army, with the Right Wing of Horſe, Commanded by the Mareſchal <hi>de</hi>

                  <hi>Villeroy,</hi> followed, and incamped at <hi>Auſart l' Eſtrang,</hi> about a League and a half from <hi>Charleroy,</hi> between it and <hi>Namur;</hi> but their Troops were ſo fatigued with the March, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued night and day, that the Colours of their Battalions were almoſt left bare, and Sixty Men made a good Battalion upon the March, the reſt being wearie ſtragled behind. The Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> was detached from this place with a Body of Horſe and Dragoons towards the <hi>Scheld,</hi> (where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were informed we did deſign to march with all ſpeed) and took his March by <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> where he re-paſſed the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and paſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> the next day at <hi>Conde,</hi> making all diligence to get to <hi>Tournay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Enemy upon our halt at <hi>Sombref</hi> the 9th. fired ſeveral Pieces of Cannon at <hi>Charleroy;</hi> I ſuppoſe for Signals of our halt; but the King being informed that the <hi>French</hi> would paſs the <hi>Sambre</hi> rather than venture the Iſſue of a Battle in the Plains of <hi>Fleury,</hi> and that they did actually begin to paſs it that very Night, gave Orders for the Army to march the next day. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Army left the Camp of <hi>Sombref</hi> the day following, and marched by <hi>Mellé</hi> towards <hi>Genap</hi> and <hi>Nivelle;</hi> about noon we paſſed the <hi>Dyle</hi> at the Village and <hi>Chateau</hi> of <hi>Promel,</hi> about Four in the Afternoon our Right was got to <hi>Arkennes</hi> upon the <hi>Senne,</hi> that runs by <hi>Nivelle</hi> and <hi>Noſtredame de Halte</hi> to <hi>Bruſſelles.</hi> We incamped here this Night; our Line went from <hi>Senne</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the <hi>Dyle,</hi> our Right at <hi>Arkennes,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Quarter; and our Left at <hi>Vaillantpont,</hi> not far from <hi>Promel,</hi> where we had paſſed the <hi>Dyle;</hi> the King took his Quarter in the Town of <hi>Nivelle.</hi> This is a neat little Town; it lies in a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and ſo cannot be made ſtrong, however it has ancient Walls and Roundels about it, and is more particularly famous for the Abbey of Secular <hi>Chanoneſſes,</hi> which are all to be Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the firſt Quality of the Countrey; they take no Vows, but may marry if they pleaſe, and leave their places. In the Choice they have Robes and Furrs like Secular Canons, and the Head-dreſs like Nuns; but otherwiſe, when they are out of the Church they dreſs themſelves like other Ladies. The deſign of the Foundation was for Women of the beſt Quality, that had no conſiderable Fortunes, to live here Honourably, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbring

the ſmall Eſtate of the Family. The Abbeſs of this Collegiate Church is Lady of the Town; and the Army, on both ſides, have been very favourable to this place, for the ſake of the Religious Ladies.</p>
               <p>Upon this March to <hi>Nivelle,</hi> the Colonel of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Train of Artillery viſiting the Ammunition Waggons, found a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in one of them that could give no good account of himſelf: He had got in by pretending himſelf to be of the Army, that he was weary, and could not march; by which pretence, and a little Drinking-Money to the Waggoner, he got leave to get up in the Waggon: The <hi>Dutch</hi> Colonel, that came to viſit the Waggons, ſuſpected him, and cauſed him to be ſearched, and found a lighted Match about him, and beſides he gave ſo ill an account of himſelf that he was ſoon diſcovered to be a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and that he was come from the Enemies to endeavour to ſet fire to our Ammunitions: For which he was ſent to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſte, where we ſhall leave him, till we come to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Puniſhment ſuitable to the Enormity of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>

The Army being now come up by

ſeveral Defiles to <hi>Soignies;</hi> our Right was at <hi>Horrues</hi> and <hi>Neufville,</hi> where the Elector had his Quarter; the Left ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out a little beyond <hi>Court Aubois;</hi> and the King had his Quarter at <hi>Soignies,</hi> an old Town in the <hi>Chatelleine</hi> of <hi>Mons,</hi> and within three ſhort Leagues of it. As ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> had made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Mons,</hi> they Summoned the Burgh-Maſters, and Inhabitants, to come and ſwear Allegiance to the <hi>French</hi> King, and ſince are reckoned in the <hi>Paijs Conquis.</hi> We heard firing of Cannon at <hi>Mons</hi> this Evening, which (as we had information the next day) was for the <hi>Dauphine</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at that place, where the whole Army followed him that very Night. Upon our march from <hi>Sombref</hi> towards the <hi>Scheld,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> made their utmoſt diligence to prevent any deſigns we could have upon their Lines, or Towns, in <hi>Flanders;</hi> for which reaſon they marched on the 11<hi>th</hi> from <hi>Auſart L' Eſtrang;</hi> (though their Army was already fatigued by their March night and day to get to that ſide of the <hi>Sambre;)</hi> they went by <hi>Ham Sur Heure,</hi> and ſo repaſſed the <hi>Sambre</hi> at <hi>Buſſiere,</hi> which was already a good March: But the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxemburg</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it neceſſary to get as far as <hi>Mons</hi> that very Night, that he may come to the <hi>Scheld</hi> as ſoon as we, ordered all the Infantry to fling away their Snap-ſacks, and march with nothing but their Arms, and all the Baggage was ordered to ſtay behind; he cauſed likewiſe all the Waggons of the Countrey to be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to follow the Army with the Soldiers Snap-ſacks, and to take up the wearied Soldiers who could not march, and bring them after to the Camp. The Enemy made a halt at <hi>Buſſiere,</hi> after they had re-paſſed the <hi>Sambre,</hi> to refreſh themſelves; the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who Commanded the Infantry as firſt Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, told them, That they had ſuffered but little for the King's Service that Campaigne, That the King's Service did now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a quick and a ſpeedy March, and therefore that ſuch who loved His Majeſty's Service ſhould ſhew it, and follow their Colours. He then cauſed 400 Piſtols-worth of Brandy, which had been brought from the neighbouring Towns for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to be given to the Infantry to drink; and ſo the Colours were ordered to march on, and all the Foot, that were come up, endeavoured to ſhew their Zeal for the King's Service by

marching along with them; but all along Waggons were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to take up thoſe who could not march, and Brandy upon every halt. The Enemy came very early, by break of day, near <hi>Mons,</hi> to which place the <hi>Dauphine</hi> was got the night before. I cannot ſay that they incamped here, becauſe all the Soldiers Tents were left behind for a more expeditious march, but here they lay down upon the ground to reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>The 12<hi>th</hi> the Army marched towards <hi>Aeth;</hi> we paſſed the River of <hi>Cambron</hi> at <hi>Lens,</hi> and ſo got into the Plain of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,</hi> where we incamped with our Right at <hi>Irchonwetz,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile of <hi>Aeth,</hi> where the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had his Quarters, and the Left at <hi>Lens,</hi> the Abby of <hi>Cambron</hi> remained in the Rear of the Left. We had the Town of <hi>Chievres</hi> before the Right, where the King took his Quarters. This is an old ruined Town, where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had once a Gariſon, but the <hi>French</hi> upon pretence that it was within the <hi>Chatelleine</hi> of <hi>Tournay,</hi> beat them out of it, and no Gariſon has been in it ſince There is hardly a finer place in all the Seventeen Provinces for an Army to incamp upon, than the Plains of <hi>Cambron,</hi> where the ſtrength and ſcituation equals the beauty and conveniency of the Plain, which reaches from the Village of <hi>Irchonwetz</hi> to <hi>Lens</hi> upon the little River that runs by <hi>Cambron,</hi> about five <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles in length, with a ſmall riſing over againſt <hi>Chievres,</hi> from whence we could have a perfect proſpect of the Camp from the Right to the Left. Our Right was covered by the <hi>Dender</hi> and <hi>Irchonwetz,</hi> which runs through <hi>Aeth,</hi> where 'tis joyned by the River of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron;</hi> and our Left and Rear by the River which from <hi>Lens</hi> went round the Rear by <hi>Cambron</hi> Abbey, and ſo to <hi>Aeth.</hi> Our Front was covered by a Wood and cloſe Defiles which are between this place and <hi>Mons.</hi> The Artillery which we had ſent from <hi>Nivelle</hi> another way, becauſe of the narrowneſs of the Defiles we were to march through, came up to us this day. But we could not long injoy the commodiouſneſs of this Camp, the King was haſtening his march to the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and ſo orders were given to march on the next day.</p>

The 13<hi>th</hi> in the Morning the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded with ſeven Brigades of Horſe, one of them under the command of Brigadier <hi>Lumley,</hi> to paſs the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Audenarde,</hi> where he was to joyn the two Brigades of Foot commanded by Major <hi>Fagel,</hi> detach'd from the Camp at <hi>Nivelle,</hi> of which we have given an account before. An Expreſs was ſent like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to Count <hi>Thian</hi> to march up from <hi>Ghendt,</hi> with the body under his command towards <hi>Audenarde;</hi> and to ſend the three Terces of <hi>Walloon</hi> Foot to gariſon in <hi>Bruges,</hi> and to leave Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier <hi>Holles</hi> Regiment in <hi>Deinſe.</hi> The ſame day the Army marched, the firſt Line paſſed the River of <hi>Irchonwetz</hi> above <hi>Aeth,</hi> the ſecond with the Cannon and Baggage marched through the Town. This Town, as it appears by what we have ſaid before, is ſcituated at the confluence of two ſmall Rivers, the <hi>Dender</hi> and that of <hi>Cambron,</hi> which paſs through the Town; it was taken by the <hi>French</hi> King in 1667, in that irruption he made in <hi>Flanders</hi> after the death of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth: 'Twas left to the <hi>French</hi> King by the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> and remain'd in their hands till the Peace of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> when it was given up again to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and as all <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Towns are very much improved by coming into <hi>French</hi> hands, ſo this place got a ſignal advantage by it: It was before of a very irregular figure, as appears by the Gates (before the <hi>French</hi> had it) which are left ſtanding to this day, and its chief Strength conſiſted in the Moraſs made by the <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Cambron</hi> River on the one ſide of it, the other was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with weak Baſtions of Earth-work, commanded by the neighbouring ground. But as ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> had it yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> Mounſieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> was ordered to uſe his Skill about it. He new Model'd the Circuit of the place, and brought it almoſt to the figure of a regular Heptagone; it has one ſide longer than the reſt (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is the Port of <hi>Tournay)</hi> which occaſions an almoſt flat Baſtion, elſe all the reſt of the Courtines and Works are near equal; the Circuit of the Town and all the Works of it are faced with Free Stone, the Foſſe all about the place is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with Tenailles or Horn-work in it, according to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Vaubans</hi> Method of Fortification, and faced with Free
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55269:37"/>
 Stone; and the River <hi>Dender</hi> joyned by the other, paſſing through the Town, keeps the Foſſe always full of Water, which they can ſtop in the Town by Sluices, or let it out again in Froſty-weather, at which time ſuch a Foſſe would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be dangerous; and becauſe the grouud about the Town, from the Port of <hi>Mons</hi> to that of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> is high and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the place, every Baſtion has a good Cavalier raiſed upon it to remedy this inconveniency. The <hi>French</hi> had made a Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work by the Port of <hi>Mons,</hi> and another by the Port of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> but as we marched through this place they were pulling it down to make it a double Foſſe and covered way between theſe two places, with Redoubts in the Angles, Saillants, or Points jetting out, which they found more convenient and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible. The place has now three very ſtately Gates, that of <hi>Mons,</hi> that of <hi>Tournay,</hi> and that of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> done according to Modern Architecture, with an Inſcription above each of them in Letters of Gold, in <hi>Latin, French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> upon the ſeveral Gates; upon that of <hi>Mons</hi> 'tis in <hi>Latin,</hi> importing that the King of <hi>France</hi> took the place in the Expedition he made in <hi>Flanders</hi> in 1667, to aſſert the right of his Queen <hi>Mary Thereſa,</hi> and that he was content to eſtabliſh the limits of his Empire here, when Fortune promiſed him the Conqueſt of all <hi>Flanders.</hi> All the other States of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> are ſo much under-valued in this piece of Flattery, that it may very well be incerted here for the ſatisfaction of <hi>England</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as I have tranſlated it.</p>

               <p>Within each of the Gates is a very fine Piazza, with the <hi>Corps de Garde</hi> at one end, and the Officers of the Guards-Room and other Apartments at the other.

We heard firing at <hi>Tournay</hi> for the arrival of the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> who as we ſaid before had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd from the Camp at <hi>Auſart letong</hi> with a good Body of Horſe, and all the Dragoons of the Army to paſs the <hi>Sambre</hi> at <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Conde,</hi> and ſo to make all poſſible diligence to joyn the Marquiſs <hi>De la Valette,</hi> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our march towards <hi>Flanders</hi> was ordered to leave <hi>Courtray,</hi> and to poſt himſelf at <hi>Pont de Eſpieres,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> Line (of which we have given a ſufficient account in our laſt Years Hiſtory) does terminate it ſelf upon the <hi>Scheld.</hi> The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> at his paſſing through the Town of <hi>Tournay,</hi> found Monſieur <hi>de l' Arteloire</hi> ready with a Train of Artillery to go down the <hi>Scheld</hi> under his Convoy to <hi>Pont de Eſpieres.</hi> When he had joyned the Marquiſs <hi>de la Vallette,</hi> they left <hi>Pont de Eſpieres,</hi> and marched down the <hi>Scheld</hi> about a League lower, and poſted themſelves at <hi>Hanterive,</hi> where they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the other ſide of the <hi>Scheld</hi> much about the ſame time that Lieutenant-General <hi>Tettan</hi> was got by <hi>Eſcanaffe</hi> on this, betimes in the Morning. We attempted to lay a Bridge of Boats upon the River, but the <hi>French</hi> oppoſed it with their ſmall Shot, and were much ſuperiour to our Detachment; for according to the <hi>French</hi> account, the Marquiſs <hi>de la Valette</hi> had then 15 Battalions, 9 Regiments of Horſe and 2 of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and beſides was now joyned by the Mareſchal <hi>de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy.</hi> Lieutenant General <hi>Tettan</hi> had 15 pieces of Cannon ſent with him, which was diſpoſed in 3 ſeveral Batteries which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to play upon the Enemy; their Cannon was not come up ſo ſoon as ours, but they intrenched themſelves juſt upon the other ſide of the River, where our Cannon did them ſome conſiderable damage: Of <hi>Maulevriers</hi> Regiment, by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, 1 Lieutenant was killed and 25 Men.

The ſame
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55269:38"/>
Morning the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> had paſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Audenarde</hi> with the 7 Brigades of Horſe and the 2 of Foot, of which we have given an account already, for which reaſon, as the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> had intrenched upon the River to hinder our paſſage, he was alſo obliged to fortifie his Rear with a Retrenchment, to cover himſelf from the Duke of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> who upon His Majeſties Orders was marching up to attack him in the Rear, whilſt we ſhould force our paſſage in the Front. I ſhall now leave things in this diſpoſition upon the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and return to both the Armies.</p>
               <p>The 14<hi>th</hi> we decamped from <hi>Grames,</hi> and marched towards the <hi>Scheld,</hi> which was now but 2 Leagues from the Right of our Army. We paſſed not far from the foot of Mount <hi>Trinite,</hi> and the Left Flank of our Columns was reckoned within 4 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles of <hi>Tournay.</hi> We heard in the Morning upon our march great firing at this place, which at firſt was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be Signals for their Army and neighbouring Garriſons, but by the regularity of the fire we found it to be rather a Salute. In effect the <hi>Dauphine</hi> paſſed this Morning through the Town, and was ſaluted with a triple diſcharge of the Cannon round the place; the Army followed him, which in two nights and one day had marched from <hi>Mons</hi> to this place. We left them at <hi>Mons</hi> the 12<hi>th,</hi> where they were got betimes in the Morning; they refreſhed themſelves the beſt part of that day, except the Brigade of Guards that was ſent to <hi>Condé,</hi> where it was put on board of <hi>Bilanders</hi> to come down the <hi>Scheld</hi> to <hi>Tournay</hi> by water, where I ſuppoſe it arrived as ſoon as the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> and with him joyned the Marquis <hi>de la Valette.</hi> The 12<hi>th</hi> in the Evening the <hi>French</hi> Army left <hi>Mons,</hi> and marched night and day (only halting for reſt now and then) and ſo came to <hi>Tournay</hi> the 14<hi>th</hi> early in the Morning; but the Waggons of the Country were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all along to take up the Sick and the Weary, and upon every halt, there was a proviſion of Brandy ready to refreſh the Men. The 14<hi>th</hi> about Noon our Right Wing came up near the River, but it was then too late to have undertaken to force the paſſage, and for the Army to have gone over, for which reaſon 'twas ordered to halt, and the Weather
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55269:39"/>
 proved ſo bad juſt at that time, that it would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to have undertaken it, though there had been day enough left for it. We had this Evening and moſt of the Night following, a violent ſtorm of Rain and Wind, which made the wayes very deep and heavy; the Army was ordered to incamp in the ground where it ſtood upon the halt, and every Brigade to incamp the moſt conveniently it could, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the niceneſs of a Line; the King took his Quarters this Night at the <hi>Chateau de Cordes,</hi> and the Elector at <hi>Chaſtelet:</hi> And the <hi>Dauphine</hi> being now come up with the Body of the <hi>French</hi> Army to joyn the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> ſo that though we had forced the paſſage of the River, yet ſtill we could not prevent the <hi>French</hi> Army from incamping between <hi>Harleber</hi> and <hi>Courtray,</hi> where they covered their Country in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and beſides the <hi>French</hi> having drawn all their Forces in this ſide of the Country, which gave the King way for another undertaking may be of as great conſequence; His Majeſty did not think it convenient to attempt the paſſage here, where there might have been a great deal of Blood ſhed, but no advantage on our ſide, though we had forced it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Enemy would ſtill have been Maſters of the Camp at <hi>Courtray,</hi> which equally covered their Lines on both ſides of the <hi>Lys.</hi> The King therefore reſolved to leave the <hi>French</hi> where they were, and to paſs the <hi>Scheld</hi> about two Leagues below at <hi>Audenarde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> very much magnified their ſpeedy Marches to prevent our paſſage of the <hi>Scheld</hi> before them, that in Four Days they ſhould with their whole Army paſs and re<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>paſs the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and paſs the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Tournay,</hi> and be the fifth incam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on the other ſide of the River, to oppoſe the paſſage of our Army: 'Tis ſaid, that the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> valued it more than the Battle of <hi>Landen;</hi> but if he valued it more, it did not coſt him much leſs, for 'tis ſuppoſed that this violent March has coſt him at leaſt Three Thouſand Men, and his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry has been almoſt ruined by it, ſo far that the <hi>French</hi> King is now forced to reform his Cavalry, (as he did the laſt Year,) and to reduce the Troops yet to a leſs Number, which the laſt Winter he had brought to Forty: (I have heard that he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55269:39"/>
them to Twenty Five a Troop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) The <hi>French</hi> Army might have been followed by the Scent which they left behind of dead Men and Horſes, which were to be found all along the Road it went; ſo that we may ſay, The <hi>French</hi> have ſuffered as much in this March as they could have done in a Battle, either in Men or Horſes. It has been reported, that the <hi>French</hi> King has writ a Letter to the Army, to be read at the Head of every Regiment, by which he thanked the <hi>Dauphine,</hi> the Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> the Lieutenant-General, and other Generals, and all the Army, but more particularly the <hi>Suiſſe</hi> and <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, for the great Services they had done him in this ſpeedy March, by which they have ſaved his Country in <hi>Flanders</hi> from the Invaſion intended by the Enemies This indeed is a very different Language from what we had laſt Year from him after the Battle of <hi>Landen;</hi> there was nothing then but what he could expect after ſo conſiderable a Victory, and there was nothing but what his Enemies ought to fear after ſo great a Defeat; but now he ſeems to recant in his Letter, and own that he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, and thanks his Army for running as faſt as they could, (and ſo faſt that it has ſuffered as much as in a Battle,) to ſave his conquered Country from being invaded by the Enemies, who laſt Year were to fear every thing after the loſs of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Landen.</hi> This is a very different Note from the firſt, and would make but a very ill concert with it: Such a thing muſt make his Subjects ſenſible, either that the ſtate of Affairs is very much altered to their diſadvantage, or that their King is ſtrangely tranſported with ſucceſs. Whether this Letter was read or no at the Head of every Regiment, I cannot tell; but ſuch a Letter has been Publiſhed at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe the <hi>French</hi> made ſo quick and diligent a March to prevent our paſſage of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> it has given occaſion to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men, who are generally raſh in giving their Judgments of things, to extol very much the Enemies Conduct in this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and as much to blame our own, without examining the different circumſtances of the one and of the other: What I ſhall ſay at preſent is not to leſſen the Wiſdom and Conduct of our Enemies, or the Commendation they deſerve; for their March was as wiſely contrived, and managed with as little loſs as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55269:40"/>
 the great diligence they uſed was capable of; I ſhall only ſhew, that conſidering our circumſtances, and thoſe of the Enemy, 'tis no wonder they could make ſuch diligence as to get before us to defend the paſſage of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and it could be no want of Conduct on our Side if they could make ſo much larger Marches than we, as to be able to be there before us; for the <hi>French</hi> had wholly the advantage of the Country on their ſide. From the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to <hi>Audenarde</hi> we met with no Garriſon of ours upon the March, but that of <hi>Aeth;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> they had in their way <hi>Namur, Charleroy, Mons, Conde, Valencionnes,</hi> and <hi>Tournay;</hi> and unleſs when we paſſed by the Plain of <hi>Cambron,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Aeth,</hi> we marched upon the Enemy's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but the <hi>French</hi> ſtill near their own numerous Garriſons: From whence the Enemy had this advantage over us for a ſpeedy March, that the Boors were all fled to their Garriſous with their Effects, from whence they could not onely get Supplies of Refreſhments for their Infantry upon every halt, but alſo Waggons to bring the Baggage, the Sick and the wearied Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers after them, in ſo much that though their Battalions were not of One Hundred Men each, at their coming up to a Camp or Halt, yet ſtill by Night all the reſt were brought up in Waggons, who could not march and follow the Army; and the Soldiers Bagagge being carried in the ſame Waggons, they marched only with their Arms ſo much lighter than ours This is a conveniency the <hi>French</hi> had, and which 'tis plain we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Beſides, the <hi>French,</hi> marching by ſo many of their Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, could be ſupplied with freſh Battalions which had ſuffered no Fatigues in the Field, but could haſten with ſo much the more eaſe to the <hi>Scheld.</hi> Another conveniency, the <hi>French</hi> marched without their Baggage, which was brought up afterwards by the Waggons of the Countrey, who had retired generally to to the neighbouring Garriſons; but our Baggage muſt march with us, or be left to the Enemies, over whoſe Country we marched, or it muſt have been ſent ſo far about, that we muſt have laid many more Nights than the <hi>French</hi> without Tent or Cover The <hi>French</hi> had no occaſion to march with their Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, being to act upon the defenſive: They had a ſufficient Train ready at <hi>Tournay</hi> to defend the Paſſage of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55269:40"/>
that they left their Train in their Garriſons to come up leaſurely after them; but we were obliged to have our Train along with us, and to proportion our Marches to the Fatigues the Artillery Horſes could endure, or elſe leave them expoſed to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Garriſons, by which we paſſed. The <hi>French</hi> had another great advantage of the <hi>Scheld;</hi> for when once they were come up between <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Condé,</hi> they could ſend down by water from <hi>Condé</hi> to <hi>Tournay,</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld,</hi> any thing that might incumber the March of their Army, or any Detachment of Forces which they thought ſufficient to oppoſe our paſſage of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> till they themſelves could come up; they ſent this way the Brigade of Guards, according to their own account, (and may be more) which ſail'd down the River night and day, till they had joyned the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> and the Marquiſs <hi>De la Valette.</hi> Now any impartial Reader muſt own theſe to be great advantages which the <hi>French</hi> had over us in this March, and ſuch as may very well equal the difference there was between the way the <hi>French</hi> had to go to the <hi>Scheld</hi> and we, which at moſt cannot amount to one part in three, which the Reader may obſerve if he will be pleaſed to conſult the Map. Nothing can be alledged againſt our diligence, but the Halt we made at <hi>Sombref</hi> the 9<hi>th.</hi> but of that we have given an account above. And at laſt, theſe who ſo willingly paſs their Judgments upon the Conduct of our Army, don't know whether their was at bottom any other Deſign, but to bring the <hi>French</hi> from the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to the <hi>Scheld,</hi> to make room for the Siege of <hi>Huy,</hi> whith (as it ſhall hereafter appear) was a place of great conſequence to us, and if it was ſo, then the <hi>French</hi> by their ſpeedy March helped our very Deſigns inſtead of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them: Or if the <hi>French</hi> would keep a Body near the <hi>Meuſe</hi> for the conſervation of <hi>Huy,</hi> then that would have made way for ſome Siege in <hi>Flanders,</hi> becauſe the <hi>French</hi> were not able to act defenſively on both ſides. Whatever was the deſign, it appears that we did what we could to make the <hi>French</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was upon <hi>Flanders,</hi> becauſe upon our March from Mount St. <hi>André,</hi> Major-General <hi>Cohorne</hi> was commanded from <hi>Liege</hi> with Twelve Battalions, and Six Squadrons of <hi>Liege</hi>-Dragoons, to march by <hi>Bruſſelles</hi> towards <hi>Ghendt.</hi> This was ſufficient to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55269:41"/>
 give the <hi>French</hi> the Alarm in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and accordingly they left <hi>Huy</hi> open to a Siege, rather than leave their Countrey in <hi>Flanders</hi> expoſed to an Invaſion.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to ſtate, as juſtly as poſſibly I could, the account of this great March which has made ſo much noiſe in the World, and in which the <hi>French</hi> have ſo much applauded their diligence. I ſhall now return to both the Armies, which we have left on both ſides of the <hi>Scheld.</hi> Our Army (as we ſaid before) had incamped the 14<hi>th.</hi> with the Right near the <hi>Scheld,</hi> the Elector's Quarter upon the Right at <hi>Chaſtelet,</hi> and the King's at <hi>Cordes.</hi> The <hi>Dauphine</hi> having paſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> this Day at <hi>Tournay,</hi> could not be hindred of the Camp of <hi>Courtray,</hi> and beſides, the Evening proved ſo bad, that though we would then have endeavoured to have paſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Hanterive,</hi> yet we could not. The next day the Army was ordered to march towards <hi>Audenarde:</hi> We came at <hi>Eſcanaffe</hi> in preſence of the <hi>French</hi> Army, incamped with the Right at <hi>Hanterive,</hi> and the Left at <hi>Avelghem,</hi> all along the <hi>Scheld,</hi> though I believe that the whole Army was not there, but at hand between it and <hi>Courtray,</hi> to obſerve our Motions. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Tettan</hi> was Poſted juſt on the other ſide of the River, with his Detachment and Field-Pieces, but the Caunon was ſilent on both ſides. From <hi>Eſcanaffe</hi> we marched all along the <hi>Scheld</hi> towards <hi>Audenarde,</hi> and incamped with our Right at <hi>Melde</hi> by <hi>Audenarde,</hi> where the Electot had his Quarter, and the Left at <hi>Eſcanaffe,</hi> over-againſt the Left of the <hi>French</hi> Army. Our Left was here cloſe under the Cannon of the Enemy, ſo that in the Evening, when we were come to our Ground, the <hi>French</hi> Cannon plaid very briskly upon our Left, where our Two Brigades of Foot, Commanded by Major<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>General <hi>Ramſay,</hi> and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe moſt Expoſed, yet I have not heard of any Men killed, but we loſt fourteen or fifteen Horſes; but the <hi>French</hi> uſed their greateſt Endeavours to do miſchief to <hi>Tettan</hi> when he came off with his Detachment, and Field-Pieces, from under their very Retrenchments, on the oppoſite ſide of the River, where he lay under cover, but could not get off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Expoſing himſelf very much to the Enemies Cannon: He remained quietly in his Poſt for this reaſon all the day, and took
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55269:41"/>
the opportunity of the Evening to come off, which he did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any loſs. The King, at this Camp before the <hi>Scheld,</hi> took his Quarter at <hi>Berghem,</hi> upon the very Bank of the River, where it was very much Expoſed to the Enemies Cannon. The Rear-Guard, which was brought up by the Firſt Battalion, and the Battalion of the Second Regiment of Engliſh Guards, and the Firſt Battalion of <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards, which had incamped upon the King's Quarters at <hi>Cordes,</hi> which was a conſiderable way from the Line of the Army, could not come up before the next Morning; for which reaſon there was no Orders given over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to march the next day.</p>
               <p>The 16<hi>th</hi> in the Morning the <hi>French</hi> began to play again upon our Left with their Cannon, where they killed ſome of our Men, and our Generals Quarters were very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed here, being juſt upon the River, but none of them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any damage Beſides the Batteries the <hi>French</hi> had againſt our Left, we perceived that they were bringing of Cannon down along the River to take up the length of our Line, and have Batteries from Right to Left; one of their General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers came up in the Morning to view the Wind-mill between <hi>Peteghem</hi> and the River, which abſolutely commanded our Right; but to hinder the Enemies bringing Cannon down any farther, we had Batteries made upon our ſide from the Kings Quarters along our Left, to hinder the Enemies from advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any further. The Cannon played on both ſides all the Morning, but without any conſiderable execution that I have heard of. The King rid out early to obſerve the countenance of the Enemy; part of their Army was making a motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Left, which gave us reaſon to ſuſpect that they deſign'd to march, and take up the Camp of <hi>Peteghem,</hi> a high ground in the way from <hi>Audenarde</hi> to the Enemies Lines, from whence they might have Canonaded the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> (who upon His Majeſties reſolution of paſſing the <hi>Scheld</hi> lower at <hi>Audenarde,</hi> was countermanded under the Cannon of this place) from whence likewiſe the Enemy would have very much incommoded our paſſage of the <hi>Scheld</hi> even here, for which reaſon His Majeſty immediately order'd the Four Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades of <hi>Erle, Stuart, Alfeldt</hi> and <hi>Haxhauſen,</hi> and the Two
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55269:42"/>
 Battalions of <hi>Scots</hi> Guards, to march and leave their Tents ſtanding, to joyn the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and take up the high ground between <hi>Poteghem</hi> and <hi>Audenarde;</hi> theſe Brigades were Commanded by the Count <hi>de Naſſau,</hi> and Major-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, <hi>Churchill, La Meleniere, Miremont</hi> and <hi>Ellenberg.</hi> We paſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Audenarde</hi> the ſame Morning, and the Two Battalions of <hi>Scheltinga</hi> and Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> came out of the Garriſon to joyn us. The <hi>French</hi> upon this motion were afraid they were coming to ſurround them, for which reaſon they immediately left their Camp at <hi>Haute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive</hi> and <hi>Avelghem,</hi> and marched directly to <hi>Courtray,</hi> where they incamped between it and <hi>Harleber;</hi> but a Party of Thirty Men of the Enemies that had advanced too near <hi>Peteghem,</hi> were all made Priſoners. Upon the removal of the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Hauterive</hi> and <hi>Avelghem,</hi> the Army that had paſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> was ordered to halt, and to incamp upon the ground where it ſtood, every Brigade to take the moſt convenient way of incamping for it ſelf: About half of the Infantry of the Army had paſſed the River, being now Six Brigades of Foot, under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg.</hi> We ſaid above that Count <hi>Thian,</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> was commanded before to <hi>Audenarde,</hi> had Orders to come up with his Body from <hi>Ghendt,</hi> and joyn him here. He came up accordingly, and incamped not far from <hi>Audenarde,</hi> between it and <hi>Deinſe,</hi> but upon the March of the <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Courtray</hi> and <hi>Harleber,</hi> he was ſent back to <hi>Deinſe,</hi> where he had left <hi>Holles</hi>'s Regiment for the ſecurity of the Paſs.</p>
               <p>The 16<hi>th</hi> the reſt of the Army paſſed the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde,</hi> and below it upon a Bridge of Boats. The <hi>Scheld</hi> above <hi>Audenarde</hi> makes a great kind of a Lake, which being reduced in a narrow Channel to run through the Town, does make the beſt and the chief defence of it; and generally all along between <hi>Audenarde</hi> and <hi>Tournay,</hi> the banks of the <hi>Scheld</hi> are low, and the ground about it a Moraſs, ſo that it is not paſſable by an Army at many places, and the paſſage may be defended with a little oppoſition. The Army marched this day between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> the King took his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at <hi>Wanneghem,</hi> our Right made an angle from <hi>Cruyſhoutem</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:55269:42"/>
(the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Quarter) towards <hi>Deinſe</hi> and the <hi>Lys;</hi> our Left ſtretched out towards the <hi>Scheld</hi> by <hi>Peteghem;</hi> our Front was covered all along with cloſe ground and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files, for which reaſon we could not incamp upon a Line, but ſome Brigades more advanced and ſome leſs; our Front run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> faced exactly the Enemies Lines which we attacked laſt year, which were not above Three Leagues from our Camp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Enemy upon our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping did not think it convenient to remain upon the ſame ſide of the <hi>Lys</hi> with us at <hi>Harleber,</hi> but on the 18<hi>th</hi> they paſſed the River at <hi>Courtray,</hi> and incamped with their Right at this place (the <hi>Dauphins</hi> Quarter) and their Left at <hi>Moorſelle</hi> towards <hi>Menin,</hi> where they were poſted equally to defend their Lines between the <hi>Scheld</hi> and the <hi>Lys,</hi> and their Towns between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the Sea, but the Marquis <hi>de la Valette</hi> was poſted at <hi>Pont de Eſpieres</hi> to defend their Lines towards the <hi>Scheld:</hi> however the <hi>French</hi> by this motion left the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try open before us, and gave us liberty of Foraging to their very Lines.</p>
               <p>The 19<hi>th</hi> our heavy Baggage came up to the Camp; it had been ſent away the 5<hi>th</hi> under the Convoy of Brigadier <hi>Wynnes</hi> Dragoons, and a Man of a Company. They marched by <hi>Louvain, Vilvor de</hi> and <hi>Ghendt,</hi> and ſo joyned us in this place. We have ſaid before that upon our marching from Mount St. <hi>André</hi> towards the <hi>Scheld,</hi> the King had ordered Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Cohorne</hi> with Twelve Battalions, and ſome <hi>Liege</hi> Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons to march towards <hi>Ghendt,</hi> which obliged the Enemy to bring all their Forces in <hi>Flanders</hi> to make head againſt ſo great an Army as we ſhould have after the joyning of all theſe Forces. The 15<hi>th</hi> Major-General <hi>Cohorne</hi> came to <hi>Vilvor de</hi> with the Body under his Command, and the 21<hi>th</hi> he marched through the Town of <hi>Ghendt,</hi> and incamped juſt without the Town, upon the Canal of <hi>Bruges;</hi> he had then with him Three Battalions of <hi>Swerin,</hi> and the Regiments of <hi>Stockhanſen, Lindeboom, Harſolt, Ameliſwert,</hi> Prince <hi>Chriſtian Lodowics, Eſſen, Vaudermeuten, Churprince</hi> and <hi>Frieſheim,</hi> and Two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of <hi>Liege</hi> Dragoons.

 Train of Artillery, and all other neceſſaries for a Siege, to ſend it up by water to <hi>Liege;</hi> and all the Boats belonging to <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> were taken for the Kings Service.</p>
               <p>The 22<hi>th</hi> we made a great Detachment under the Command of Count <hi>de Noyelles</hi> Lieutenant-General, towards the Right, to cover Pioneers, who had come up to cut ways through the incloſures we had before us; and we had Bridges laid upon the <hi>Lys</hi> and upon the <hi>Scheld</hi> for the conveniency of the Army to Forage on the other ſide of both theſe Rivers, and alſo to leave the Enemies in ſuſpence (who were now buſie in fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Courtray</hi> for a Winter-Quarter) which way we deſign'd to march next, whether farther in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or back again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Meuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 24<hi>th</hi> the heavy Baggage was commanded back again to <hi>Ghendt,</hi> and Pontons were ſent to make Bridges upon the <hi>Lys</hi> at <hi>Mechlen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 25<hi>th.</hi> the Right Wing of <hi>Horſe,</hi> and Body of Foot, was ordered to march towards the <hi>Lys,</hi> except the Brigade of Guards, which remained incamped at the King's Quarter; and and the ſame Day Lieutenant-General <hi>Dewits</hi> was ordered to re-paſs the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Audenarde,</hi> and to march towards the <hi>Meuſe</hi> with the <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Horſe under his Command.</p>
               <p>The 26<hi>th.</hi> the whole Army marched, and paſſed the <hi>Lys</hi> upon two Bridges at <hi>Mechlen.</hi> We began now to come in the cloſe Country of <hi>Flanders;</hi> and this is the reaſon that part of the Army was ordered to march from the Camp at <hi>Wanneghem</hi> the day before, becauſe the Defiles were ſuch here, that the whole Army could not have marched from <hi>Wanneghem,</hi> and paſs the <hi>Lys,</hi> in one day. After we had paſſed the <hi>Lys,</hi> we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped with our Right at <hi>Caneghem,</hi> where the Elector had his Quarter, and the Left between <hi>Markeghem</hi> and <hi>Wacken</hi> upon the <hi>Lys;</hi> the King took his Quarter at <hi>Wouterghem</hi> about Three Engliſh Miles from <hi>Deinſe;</hi> the Artillery and Baggage march<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The 29<hi>th.</hi> Count <hi>Thian</hi> march'd from <hi>Deinſe,</hi> and came up to joyn us; he incamped before our Left at <hi>Wacken,</hi> where the River <hi>Mandel</hi> that comes from <hi>Rouſelar</hi> falls into the <hi>Scheld.</hi> The Second Battalion of the Royal Regiment came to incamp
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55269:43"/>
in the Line, and Colonel <hi>Lauders</hi> was ordered to joyn Count <hi>Thian</hi> in its place; he was likewiſe reinforced with <hi>Mathars</hi> Regiment of Dragoons. The 29<hi>th</hi> the Body of Foot and the Two Brigades interlined in the Right Wing of Horſe, together with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe upon the Right, and the Brigade of Life-Guards and <hi>Boncourts,</hi> with <hi>Eppinger</hi> and <hi>Dopfs</hi> Dragoons upon the Left, marched by <hi>Thielt,</hi> and ſo came to <hi>Rouſelar:</hi> The ground being very cloſe here, and generally all over the Province of <hi>Flanders,</hi> we had no occaſion for Horſe; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files were very bad, and the March long and tedious. The King took his Quarters at <hi>Rouſelar,</hi> our Right reached to <hi>Hooghleede,</hi> where the Elector of <hi>Ravaria</hi> had his Quarter, and our Left by <hi>Rumbek</hi> upon the River <hi>Mandel;</hi> the ground upon which we incamped was all high incloſures, with rowes of Trees upon all the Hedges, which made the Country here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts ſo cloſe, that one Battalion could hardly ſee thoſe upon the Right or Left. The Town of <hi>Rouſelar</hi> is called in <hi>French Roulers</hi> (as moſt of the Towns in this Country have a <hi>French</hi> and a <hi>Dutch</hi> name, which are often very different from one another) and ſituated near the Springs of the River <hi>Mandel,</hi> which falls into the <hi>Lys</hi> at <hi>Wacken.</hi> The Country all about it is very even, though Woody, for which reaſon if this little River could afford more water for a good Foſſe, the Town might be very well fortified; it is in the <hi>Chatellenie</hi> of <hi>Ipres</hi> three Leagues from thence, nine from <hi>Ghendt,</hi> three from <hi>Courtray,</hi> four from <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> and ſix from <hi>Bruges;</hi> this is reckoned the laſt place of the <hi>Pajis conquis,</hi> and in time of Peace the <hi>French</hi> King had Officers to gather his Duties for Goods Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or Exported, as being his utmoſt Frontier. The Duke of <hi>Newbourgh,</hi> now Elector Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> is Lord of this place, but he has a bad Tenant in the <hi>French</hi> King. The Foot being incamped at <hi>Rouſelar,</hi> all the Horſe remained at <hi>Wouterghem</hi> under the Command of my Lord of <hi>Athlone,</hi> aud the Two Brigades of Foot interlined, under the Command of Major-General <hi>Ramſay;</hi> but the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe of the Right Wing joyned the Left. Though we were incamped here in very ſtrong and cloſe ground, yet 'twas commanded by the heighth or little Hill of <hi>Hooghleede</hi> (where we had our Right)
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55269:44"/>
 which is a rare thing in this level Country: We made ſeveral Redoubts upon it for the ſecurity of our Camp, this being the only place by which we could be attacked. The <hi>French</hi> upon our March to this place made ſeveral Detachments from their Army for the ſecurity of their Country; the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> was commanded with a Body to incamp by <hi>Ipres</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our paſſage of the Canal, which goes from this place by the <hi>Knock</hi> and <hi>Furnes</hi> to <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi> had Orders to leave <hi>Pont de Eſpieres</hi> to come and poſt himſelf between <hi>Furnes</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Knock</hi> for the defence of theſe places. We have given an account of both of them in our firſt relation for the Year 1692, to which I ſhall refer the Reader. I muſt not omit to ſay that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Artillery upon our March to <hi>Rouſelar,</hi> was ſent from the Camp at <hi>Wou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terghem</hi> to <hi>Malines</hi> its uſual Winter-quarter.</p>
               <p>The King having now brought all the Enemies Forces in <hi>Flanders</hi> (except the Body of Horſe Commanded by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> which was not ſufficient to hinder or oppoſe his deſigns) had reſolved to beſiege <hi>Huy,</hi> for which end (as we have ſaid before) great preparations of Ammunitions, and all other neceſſaries for a Siege had been prepared at <hi>Maeſtricht;</hi> His Majeſty had ſent alſo Lieutenant-General <hi>de Witz</hi> from the Camp at <hi>Wanneghem</hi> with the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Horſe, to joyn the <hi>Liege</hi> Forces to inveſt the place; but the Care and Conduct of the Siege was kept for the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen,</hi> Velt-Mareſchal General of the States Forces; accordingly upon our March from <hi>Wouterghem</hi> to <hi>Rouſelar,</hi> the King ordered the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> to go and Command the Forces to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Siege of <hi>Huy,</hi> and Major-General <hi>Cohorne</hi> who had remained with his Body (of which we have already given an account) near <hi>Ghendt</hi> till this time, was commanded to march towards <hi>Liege.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 31<hi>th</hi> the Three Battalions of Guards, the firſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guards, the ſecond of <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards, and the third, the ſecond Battalion of <hi>Scots</hi> Guards, were ordered to incamp on the other ſide of the Town of <hi>Rouſelar</hi> towards <hi>Ipres,</hi> to cover the Kings Quarters; for the Country being cloſe and Woody made the Enemies Parties very bold.

The ſame day the Priſoner, of which we have given an account in the March from <hi>Sombref</hi> to <hi>Nivelle,</hi> that was taken in one of the Ammunition Waggons with a lighted Match, was burnt alive, after he had firſt his Right hand cut off, and flung into the fire; he was put to the Torture to confeſs his Ruin, and was found guilty by the Court-Marſhal of deſigning to blow up our Powder Waggons; I have not yet ſeen the Copy of the Sentence, and ſo I cannot give a farther account of his Crime, and of the Perſons by whom he was ſet on; I have only heard that it was the Marquis <hi>de Grammont.</hi> We had ſuch an Accident in the Campagne of 1691. the Evening that we returned from <hi>Beaumont</hi> to the Camp at <hi>Court Sur Heure:</hi> The thing was undertaken by one of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Traine; he actually ſet fire to Two Bombs, which put the whole Army into an Alarm, and if the Gunners had not hazarded themſelves very much, to fling them out of the Waggons, it would in all probability have ſet all our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Waggons on fire; he underwent afterwards the ſame puniſhment at the Camp of St. <hi>Gerrard;</hi> his Right hand was cut off, and burnt before his face, and was himſelf afterwards burnt alive with a ſmall fire, which he indured with a great deal of conſtancy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third,</hi> an Enſign of King <hi>James</hi> his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Guards left the Enemies Camp, and came over to our Army; and the ſame day one <hi>Pierce Oliver,</hi> that had been a Sergeant in the Dragoons of <hi>Valencar</hi> and Native of <hi>Tournay,</hi> was hanged near the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Quarter: He had deferted the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service, and went over to the Enemies, where he turned Partiſan; he

The King having dined with the Lord of <hi>Athlone,</hi> returned the ſame night to the Camp, after he had ordered a Detachment of Thirty Squadrons of Horſe, and ſome Dragoons, to march towards <hi>Aeth</hi> under the Command of Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> Major-General: This Detachment was made to cover <hi>Bruſſelles</hi> from the Garriſon of <hi>Mons,</hi> which made ſome Incurſions to the very Canal of <hi>Bruſſelles;</hi> and alſo to obſerve the Enemy, in caſe they ſhould make any Detachments towards <hi>Huy.</hi> The ſame day the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of <hi>Hackelem, Dedem,</hi> and <hi>Holſtein Beck,</hi> were ſent to reinfore the Army to be imployed in the Siege of <hi>Huy;</hi> they were Commanded by Brigadier <hi>Dedem,</hi> and followed the next day by the Regiments of <hi>Birkenfeldt, Zobel,</hi> and <hi>Sparre,</hi> and the 6<hi>th</hi> by the Regiments of the <hi>Rhingrave, Holſtein-Norbourg, Goar,</hi> and <hi>Dumont,</hi> under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein Norbourg,</hi> Brigadier; the Regiment of <hi>Lowenhaupt</hi> was detached the ſame Day towards the Canal of <hi>Bruſſelles,</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it from the Attempt of Parties.</p>
               <p>The 7<hi>th.</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>'s Quarter took fire, which began in his Kitchin, and the Wind was ſo high that it preſently conſumed above Twenty Houſes to the Leeward, in the Street that goes to <hi>Ghendt,</hi> moſt of them being covered with Straw; but the Duke's Servants had the time to ſave the beſt of his Baggage, and Furniture for the Houſe, ſo that he ſuffered no great Dammage by it. The ſame day all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe and Dragoons, and all the Cavalry upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pay, came up to <hi>Rouſelar</hi> from the Camp of <hi>Wouterghem,</hi> under the Command of Monſieur <hi>d' Anverquerque,</hi> and incamped that Night upon the Left between <hi>Rombeck</hi> and <hi>Inghelmonſter.

               <p>The 8th. the Dauphine left the Enemy's Camp between <hi>Courtray</hi> and <hi>Menin,</hi> to return to <hi>Verſailles;</hi> by Eight in the Morning he parted from <hi>Courtray,</hi> being ſaluted by a Triple Diſcharge of the Enemy's Cannon; by Twelve he arrived at <hi>Liſle,</hi> and was met at the Gates by the Mareſchal <hi>de Bouflers,</hi> the Governour of the Place ſince the Death of the Mareſchal <hi>de Humieres,</hi> and by the Magiſtrates; all the Cannon was fired thrice round the Town and Citadel; he was treated by the Mareſchal <hi>de Bouflers,</hi> and ſo continued his way towards <hi>Verſailles.</hi> We could hear very plainly the Enemy's Cannon upon this occaſion.</p>
               <p>The Reſolution being taken to fortifie <hi>Dixmude</hi> for a Winter Quarter, after the Report which Quarter-Maſter-General <hi>Dopf</hi> made of it to His Majeſty, Six Regiments were Commanded on the 9th. to this Place, the Two <hi>French</hi> Regiments of <hi>Belcaſtel</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:55269:46"/>
 and <hi>Marton,</hi> three <hi>Danes,</hi> the Queen's, Prince <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Jutland,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Regiment of <hi>Aver;</hi> they were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Major-General <hi>Ellenbergh,</hi> who has been made Governour of the Place; Captain <hi>Cock</hi>'s Company of Gunners and <hi>Matroſſes</hi> was ſent at the ſame time, with Fifteen Pieces of Cannon and Ammunitions, and the Boors were ſet at work to fortifie the Place, aſſiſted with a Detachment out of every one of theſe Regiments. I have given a Deſcription of this Place in my Relation of the Campagne of 1692. to which I refer the Reader. I have not heard we have altered any thing in this Fortification, but only made up again the Works which the <hi>French</hi> left laſt Spring when they abandoned it. The ſame Day the Regiments of <hi>Bernſtorf-Zell,</hi> and <hi>Bulo,</hi> were detached from the Camp to march towards <hi>Bruſſelles</hi> and <hi>Louvain,</hi> and the <hi>Suiſſe</hi> Regiment of <hi>Milune,</hi> and the Regiment of <hi>Luo</hi> to <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 10<hi>th.</hi> the King went towards <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> to Review the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalry and Dragoons, which appeared in very good order, at ſuch a time of the Year, and after ſo many Marches.</p>
               <p>The 11<hi>th.</hi> His Majeſty Reviewed the Infantry, which drew out of the Camp upon Two Lines, all the General Officers being poſted upon their ſeveral Diviſions of the Army, where they ſaluted the King as he rid along the Line His Majeſty rid round every Battalion of the Army, to take a more ſpecial and exact Review of them, and his <hi>Aid de Camps</hi> took an account of the depth and number of the Files, to compute the Strength of each Battalion. The Body of the Infantry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared generally in very good order, the Regiments very full, and in a better condition than they have been at this time of the Year ſince the beginning of the War, notwithſtanding the great Marches we had for ſo many Days together, from the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to the <hi>Scheld.</hi> Indeed the Weather was all along very favourable and free from heat, which gave a great deal of eaſe to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who rather marched better the laſt Days than the firſt. The ſame Day the King Reviewed the Foot, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Troop of Life-Guard was ordered to march towards <hi>Loo</hi> to make the Relays for His Majeſty from <hi>Breda</hi> to that place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:55269:46"/>
 The 12<hi>th</hi> the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> reviewed the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Bavarian</hi> Forces, His Majeſty being preſent, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in good order as all the Army had done. The King din'd afterwards with Prince <hi>Vaudemont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 15<hi>th</hi> the King went to <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> to view the place himſelf, to ſee the condition of the Works, and what forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they were in, and His Majeſty this day dined with my Lord <hi>Auverquerque</hi> that commanded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalry and Dragoons canton'd about this place. The ſame day the King had an Expreſs from the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> from the Camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Huy,</hi> that the 13<hi>th</hi> at night we had advanced our works and approaches to the point of the Counterſcarp of the Forts <hi>Rouge</hi> and <hi>Picard,</hi> that our Cannon had made breaches large enough to make an aſſault the next day upon theſe Forts. This place was inveſted the 7<hi>th</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tilly</hi> with the <hi>Liege</hi> Forces. The 9<hi>th</hi> the Artillery and Mortars came up by Water from <hi>Liege.</hi> The 10<hi>th,</hi> 11<hi>th</hi> and 12<hi>th,</hi> the Beſiegers worked at their Batteries, upon which they mounted their Cannon and Mortars. This Day their Batteries began to play upon the Two Forts, and the Night they opened the Trenches at their ſeveral Attacks. I ſhall ſay no more of the Siege of <hi>Huy,</hi> but what we had in our Camp by Expreſſes from the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> till we come to the News of the Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after which I ſhall incert the Journal of that Siege, to give a more particular and exact account of it.</p>
               <p>To return to the Camp at <hi>Rouſelar.</hi> The 15<hi>th</hi> in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we heard very great firing towards <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> by which we ſoon imagined that our Fleet was before the place Commanded by Sir <hi>Cloudeſly Shovel,</hi> Vice-Admiral: The Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> upon the news of our Fleets being before the place, left immediately his Camp near <hi>Ipres</hi> and went to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> accompanied with ſeveral General Officers to ſee the ſucceſs and iſſue of the undertaking, to be there ready for the defence of the place. Our Machines had no ſucceſs here, and the Enemy were ſo well provided for our coming, that their Out-Forts did not permit our Bomb-Ketches to come near enough to do any damage to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:55269:47"/>
 The 16<hi>th</hi> the King had by an Expreſs from the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> the news of his having carried the Forts <hi>Rouge</hi> and <hi>Picard</hi> by Aſſault, with about Three Hundred of the Enemy put to the Sword, and Seventy only eſcaped out of the Fort <hi>Picard</hi> to the Caſtle, with the Commanding Officer, but a Lieutenant-Colonel that Commanded in the Fort <hi>Rouge</hi> was killed in the Trench, where he flung himſelf in the midſt of our Men after he ſaw the Fort ſo eaſily carried by our Forces.</p>
               <p>The 17<hi>th</hi> the Regiments of <hi>Leſley, Tiffeny, Maitland, Tergueſon</hi> and <hi>Buchan,</hi> were detached from the Camp to march to <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> being appointed to have their Winter-Quarters in the <hi>Camerlings Ambackt,</hi> or the Country about the Canal of <hi>Newport,</hi> which is not far from this place. They made Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raques or Huts of Straw without the Works of <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> where they continued incamped to work with the Garriſon at the Fortification till it has been finiſhed; after which they went into their Winter Quarters: The Fortification of <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> went on hitherto but leaſurely for want of Men, for which reaſon theſe Regiments were detach'd to forward the work. The Camp of <hi>Rouſelar</hi> being ſtrong by the cloſeneſs of the ground, and the Wood and Defiles about it, gave us the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of making ſecurely as many Detachments as we wanted, though we were incamped juſt by the Enemies Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and their own Army too. The ſame day the King by an Expreſs from the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> had an account that the Beſiegers before <hi>Huy</hi> had made themſelves Maſters the 15<hi>th</hi> of a Tower that commands the way that leads up to the Caſtle, defended by the Major of the Caſtle and Forty Men, and the 18<hi>th,</hi> that our Batteries were playing upon the Caſtle, ſince the taking of the Two Forts <hi>Rouge</hi> and <hi>Picard,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, and from whence our Batteries played with ſuch ſucceſs againſt it, that a breach was made, and that he hoped in a very ſhort time to be Maſter of the place. The Cannon, when once we were Maſters of the Two Forts, did ſo much annoy the Beſieged in the Caſtle, that a Centinel did not dare to ſhew himſelf upon the Ramparts of it.</p>
               <p>The 19<hi>th</hi> the Army had Orders to Forage all the Churches and Cloiſters before us in the <hi>Chatellenie</hi> of <hi>Ipres,</hi> and to take
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55269:47"/>
out the Corn they had there: The Town of <hi>Rouſelar</hi> was not ſpared, and the Cloiſter of the <hi>Auguſtines</hi> was Foraged as well as the reſt, the Country before being the Frontier of the <hi>Pajis conquis,</hi> 'twas thought convenient to deſtroy the Corn and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage about the Enemies Garriſons as much as poſſibly we could, and the Enemy by our incamping here being kept within their own Garriſons, were no leſs inconvenient to the Country round about: They had incamped between <hi>Courtray</hi> and <hi>Menin</hi> ſince the 18<hi>th</hi> of the laſt Month, inſomuch that though they had agreed with the Chatellenie of <hi>Liſle</hi> to excuſe it from Forage, yet we kept them ſo long here, that they were forced to break the bargain, and not only the Chatellenie of <hi>Liſle</hi> was forced to ſend Forage to the Army, but the Towns and Villages much more remote from the Enemies Frontiers were obliged to do the ſame thing. The 19<hi>th</hi> day Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> Major-General of the States Forces that had been commanded with a Detachment of Thirty Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons towards <hi>Aeth,</hi> had the misfortune to be taken Priſoner in his own Quarters at <hi>Mafle,</hi> between <hi>Aeth</hi> and <hi>Mons,</hi> by the treachery of one of his own Domeſtick Servants, who run away to <hi>Mons,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Enemy of the condition of the Major-Generals Quarters, what Guard it had upon it, and how it might be ſurprized; who accordingly ſent immediately a ſtrong Party of Dragoons that ſurprized his Quarters, made him Priſoner, and carried him to <hi>Mons:</hi> This is the ſame Gentleman that had the misfortune laſt Year to be attacked by a ſtrong Detachment of the Enemies Horſe, all of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Houſe, near <hi>Tongres,</hi> where he was poſted with Nine or Ten Squadrons of Horſe, with which he was to joyn our Army; he was forced to retreat towards <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> with the loſs of ſome of his Baggage; and not Count <hi>Cerclas,</hi> now Prince of <hi>Tilly,</hi> as I ſaid laſt Year by a miſtake.</p>
               <p>The 20<hi>th</hi> early in the Morning the King left the Army to go by <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> to <hi>Loo,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Hague,</hi> in order to repaſs the Sea. His Majeſty was attended out of the Camp by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and all the General Officers of the Army, and had an Eſcorte of Fourſcore Men out of each Battalion, Commanded by the Prince of <hi>Anhault</hi> Brigadier;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55269:48"/>
 the Detachment out of the Kings Forces was Commanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Prince of <hi>Anhault</hi> by Colonel <hi>Titcomb,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonels, <hi>Peyton</hi> and <hi>Corbet,</hi> and Major <hi>Sabine,</hi> they conveyed the King to <hi>Deinſe,</hi> where a ſtrong Detachment of Horſe out of my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi>'s Forces, which were quartered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, attended to conduct the King farther on His way. His Majeſty paſſed through the Town of <hi>Ghendt, incognito,</hi> and lay that Night at <hi>Overmeere</hi> between <hi>Ghendt</hi> and <hi>Dendermond,</hi> and ſo His Majeſty went on His Journey towards <hi>Liege,</hi> good Eſcortes being laid by relays all along the way. The King juſt at his going out of the Camp, had by an Expreſs from the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> an account that the Caſtle of <hi>Huy</hi> had Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated the 17<hi>th,</hi> and that the Garriſon was to march out of the breach the next Day, with Drums beating, Colours flying, and other marks of Honour, but without Artillery, to <hi>Namur.</hi> Thus far the account of <hi>Huy,</hi> as we have had it in the Camp; but becauſe it has been the moſt remarkable Action of this Campagne, I ſhall here incert the Journal of this Siege.</p>

                  <p>The ſame Day that we inveſted <hi>Huy,</hi> the Count <hi>de Guiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card,</hi> Governour of <hi>Namur,</hi> who had put himſelf into the place to defend it in perſon, went out of it betimes in the Morning under a good Eſcorte of Dragoons by an expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Court, which injoyned him to go back to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55269:49"/>
of <hi>Namur,</hi> whither he got with ſome difficulty: We had the News in our Camp that he was forced to leave his Baggage behind him, which fell by this means into our hands, but afterwards was returned ſafely to him. The Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> at his going out paid the Garriſon, which was made up of the Regiments of <hi>Ponthieu</hi> and <hi>Angoumois,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Twelve Companies each, which made between Thirteen and Fourteen Hundred Foot, and One free Company of Dragoons. The defence of the place was recommended to Monſieur <hi>de Regnac</hi> Commandant of the Caſtle. About Noon ſome Deputies from the Magiſtrates of <hi>Huy</hi> came to wait upon the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> by Monſieur <hi>de Regnacs</hi> leave, to make ſome Propoſitions, according to which he was willing to deliver the Keys of the Town into their hands, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the Forts and Caſtle if the Duke would conſent to them.</p>

About Four in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Monſieur <hi>de Regnac</hi> cauſed the following Article to be added to it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>That the Allies ſhould not attack the Caſtle by the Town or Faubourgs, nor cauſe any Troops to paſs the Bridge in a Body during the Siege; nor any Cannon, Ammunitions or any other Proviſions of War; and that by vertue of this Capitulation he ſhould deliver the next Day by Six in the Morning the Keys of the Town in the hands of the Magistrate.</p>

                  <p>This Capitulation having been agreed unto, and ſigned by the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Regnac,</hi> the Beſieged left the Town, and retired into the Caſtle and Forts; Four of of our Battalions entered into the place to take poſſeſſion of it. Having now the Caſtle and Forts to beſiege, the Duke of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55269:50"/>
                     <hi>Holſtein</hi> took his Quarter upon the Hill of <hi>Coureux;</hi> with moſt of the Generals; we began to work at our Batteries, and we finiſhed our Bridge of Communication at <hi>Taverne.</hi> The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my made a great Fire with their Artillery againſt our Works, and ſhot ſome Bombs, but without doing any conſiderable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. The Evening they made a Salley on that ſide where Major-General <hi>Cohorne</hi> Commanded, thinking to poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of three Field-Pieces we had there, but the Guard ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perceived it gave the Alarm, and we repulſed the Enemy, with ſome loſs on their Side.</p>
                  <p>The 9<hi>th.</hi> the Beſieged continued to fire with their Artillery, but not ſo briskly as the day before, and ſome Deſerters, who came over to us, reported, that they had ſome Gunners killed in the Fort <hi>Picard</hi> by three Pieces of Cannon which had broke. We haſtened our Work at the Batteries, and other Works, and landed as faſt as we could our heavy Artillery, which had come up to our Bridge of Communication at <hi>Taverne,</hi> by the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> conſiſting of Fifty and Five battering Pieces, and Twenty Eight Mortars, beſides the Cannon we had brought by Land.</p>
                  <p>The 10<hi>th.</hi> we had advice that the Beſieged, reſolving to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves to the laſt extremity, did work within as faſt as they could, chiefly to cover themſelves in their Works with Earth and Hay, to defend themſelves from our Bombs: They fired upon none but thoſe who appeared out of the Faubourgs of the Place, and made but a ſmall Fire upon us this day, and hitherto they had killed us but very few Men</p>
                  <p>The 11<hi>th.</hi> the Enemy fired upon us with their Cannon and Mortars, with more Vigour than they had done the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We finiſhed this Enening our Batteries for Cannon and Mortars; we had one upon the Hill of <hi>Coureux,</hi> the ſecond near the Counterſcarpe; Major-General <hi>Cohorné</hi> had one above <hi>Croiſiers,</hi> upon the <hi>Saur;</hi> Brigadier <hi>Swerin</hi> another near St. <hi>Leonard;</hi> and Prince <hi>Circlas</hi> of <hi>Tilly</hi> had the fifth.</p>
                  <p>The 12<hi>th.</hi> the Enemy fired very briskly upon us till Nine in the Morning, that the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> being come to the chief Battery upon the Hill <hi>de Coureux,</hi> gave the Signal by ordering a Bomb to be fired in the Air, after which this, and all other
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55269:51"/>
 Batteries, both of Cannon and Mortars, fired without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; all the Generals had poſted themſelves by the main Battery, to be Spectators of this Work. This Evening we opened the Trenches at the <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Quarter, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their Attack towards the Fort <hi>Picard;</hi> the reſt did the ſame at their other Attacks.</p>
                  <p>The 13<hi>th.</hi> we had a thick Fog in the Morning, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Vigour of our Fire, but as ſoon as it was over, our Cannon and Mortars began to play with more force from all our Batteries; that of St. <hi>Leonard</hi> fired perpendicular upon the Head of the Fort <hi>Picard,</hi> to make a Breach. The Enemy, who kept themſelves in their Works, fired but ſeldom with Two Six-pounders, of which we ſoon diſmounted one; they fired ſome Vollies of Shot upon the Bridge of the Town, which cauſed the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> to ſend a Meſſage to Monſieur <hi>de Regnac,</hi> to let him know, that it was againſt the Tenor of the Capitulation, which would oblige him to give no quarter when once he ſhould be Maſter of the Caſtle: The Governour endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to excuſe himſelf, but the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> returned for Anſwer by a Drum, that he was a <hi>German</hi> and could not underſtand the wrangling of the <hi>French.</hi> A Deſerter came in, and told us, that the Beſieged could not hold out much longer, that our Bombs had ruined their Well, and had broke to pieces moſt of their Casks filled with Beer and Water, that they had ſpoiled their Proviſions, and put their Magazines of Faſcines on fire; thereupon we puſh'd our Approaches to the Foot of the Counterſcarpe, and the Beſieged killed and wounded ſome of our Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>The 14<hi>th.</hi> the Enemies Fire ceaſed. The General held a Council of War, where it was concluded, That the Breach in the Forts <hi>Rouge</hi> and <hi>Picard</hi> being wide enough for an Aſſault, Orders ſhould be given to the <hi>Brandenbourgers,</hi> who were the moſt advanced, to prepare themſelves for it; and all things being ready, the Signal was given about Four in the Afternoon, after which they made the Aſſault upon the Fort <hi>Picard</hi> with ſo much bravery, that in leſs than half an hour they carried it Sword in hand, without any great reſiſtance from the Enemy, of whom they made a great ſlaughter: The Fort <hi>Rouge</hi> had the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55269:51"/>
ſame ſucceſs; our People came into the place with the Enemies, before they had time to know themſelves. The <hi>Paris</hi> Gazette gave an account that they ſuſtained our Aſſault twice, but that we carried it the third time, after a vigorous Reſiſtance. Thus 'tis honourable to have to do with a proud Enemy. We car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at the ſame time the Tower of St. <hi>Leonard,</hi> and another which ſurrendred at diſcretion: Monſieur <hi>de Condron,</hi> the King's Lieutenant that Commanded in theſe Forts, eſcaped with 60 or 70 Men, out of 300, though he was very much wounded, after he had nailed three pieces of Cannon, which he was forced to leave in our power, and ſprung a Mine, which had no effect at all. Among the Priſoners we took, thoſe of note were Monſieur <hi>de Tromboy,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel of the Regiment of <hi>Ponthien,</hi> one Major, three Captains, aad other Officers; but the Sieur <hi>Fronier,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel of <hi>Angoumois,</hi> was not found in the Caſtle, nor amongſt the Priſoners, and ſo it was concluded that he was killed: Our Soldiers ſtript all thoſe that were killed naked, ſo that he could not be found. We had in this Action but 9 or 10 Soldiers killed, and ſome wounded.</p>
                  <p>The 15<hi>th.</hi> we changed ſome Batteries, with which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued our Fire, to ruine all the Works, the Caſemates, &amp;c. of the Caſtle. We had ſeveral Faſcines brought to fill the Ditch, and diſpoſed all things for an Aſſault; about Eleven in the Evening the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> ſent to ſummon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant to ſurrender and deliver to the Magiſttates of the Town divers Burthers whom he detained in the Caſtle, contrary to the Capitulation. During this Meſſage we had a ceſſation of Arms for half an hour; at which time the Officer, the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> had ſent, returned with this Anſwer from the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, That it was not time yet to ſurrender, that he would ſtay till things were brought to a greater Extremity, that for the Burghers demanded he had reaſon to retain them without explaining himſelf any further. The Beſieged did think of making a Retrenchment in the Caſtle, where to retreat and capitulate in caſe of an Aſſault.</p>
                  <p>The 16<hi>th.</hi> we began again, as ſoon as it was day, to fire from all our Batteries to make the Breach wider, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all the Defence the Beſieged had, but we found it more
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55269:52"/>
 difficult than was at firſt believed, to bring down the heaps of Stone at the Breach.</p>
                  <p>The 17<hi>th.</hi> we continued the ſame Work till One in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, that the Beſieged beat the <hi>Chamade,</hi> and asked to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate, which ſurprized us very much, ſince they might yet have defended themſelves very well for ſome days; for though the Breach was wide enough, yet 'twas very difficult to go up to it. Hoſtages were Exchanged on both Sides, and the Count <hi>de Lur,</hi> Colonel of the Regiment of <hi>Angoumois,</hi> brought the Conditions in Writing to the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> according to which the Commandant would deliver up the Caſtle, which after examination ſome were agreed unto, and ſome rejected. We would have given no other Conditions but thoſe which the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> had granted the Year before to the Baron <hi>de Roneſſe</hi> when he took it, which cauſed great conteſtations on both Sides, and ſeveral Meſſages backwards and forwards. The <hi>French</hi> inſiſted very much to have marched out with Cannon, which was abſolutely refuſed; but at laſt the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> ſent word to Monſieur <hi>de Regnac,</hi> If that Night paſſed without accepting the Conditions he had preſcribed, that the next Morning he would make a general Aſſault upon the Place, without any regard to the ſaid Conditions; which Meſſage had the ſucceſs we expected; for the Count <hi>de Lur</hi> came about Mid-night to the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> with Monſieur <hi>de Regnac</hi>'s Couſent to the ſaid Articles, which I ſhall here inſert for the ſatisfaction of the Reader, as they were propoſed by Monſieur <hi>de Regnac,</hi> and granted by the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen.</hi>

                  <p>According to the Capitulation Monſieur <hi>de Regnac</hi> marched out of the Caſtle between Nine and Ten in the Morning by the Breach, at the head of his Garriſon, conſiſting of about Seven Hundred Men carrying Arms, which remained of Thirteen or Fourteen Hundred, they had at the beginning of the Siege; they had about Three Hundred wounded. The Governour <hi>Regnac</hi> Complemented the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> as he paſſed by him, which the Duke returned very civilly. We had the news in our Camp that the Breach was ſo difficult that the Garriſon had much ado to march out of it, and that finding this way ſo difficult, the Governour would willingly have changed the Firſt Article of the Capitulation, and have marched out of the Gate; but the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> anſwered, That Capitulations were Sacred, and exactly to be obſerved; and therefore ſince they had made their bargain to march out of the Breach, they conld not go out any other way. We obliged the <hi>French</hi> to leave Hoſtages for the payment of their Debts contracted in the Town; and of the Cattle which they had taken before the Siege from the Inhabitants of the Town, and neighbouring Villages. We took likewiſe our Deſerters which were among the <hi>French</hi> in this place. The ſame Morning we ſent a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

 of Six Hundred Foot of the <hi>Dutch, Brandenburgh</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> Forces to take poſſeſſion of the Caſtle, where they entred by the Breach, the Sieur <hi>Tobie</hi> Ingenier had the command of it given him till other Orders; Brigadier <hi>Lindeboom</hi> was made Governour of the Town. 'Tis a very wonderful thing that during the Siege we had not above Forty Men kill'd and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no Officer killed, and none wounded but a <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Major, which adds very much to the Reputation of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; that he has in ſo little time, and with ſo little loſs, reduc'd a place to the Allies which the <hi>French</hi> had taken as much care as they could to fortifie, and to furniſh it with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a good defence; notwithſtanding, this place was taken in five days from the opening of the Trenches, which is no longer than the Baron <hi>de Roneſſe</hi> defended it laſt Year againſt the <hi>French.</hi> 'Twas inveſted by the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> the 9<hi>th,</hi> the Trench was opened the 10<hi>th,</hi> and the Caſtle ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July;</hi> though the Fort <hi>Picard</hi> was not then quite finiſhed, and that the Enemy hath ſince added the Fort <hi>Rouge,</hi> both which are ſituated upon the points of Hills which commanded the Caſtle; 'tis true that ſince we had made our ſelves Maſters of theſe two Forts, they ſo much commanded the Caſtle, that the Enemy could not perſwade the Soldiers to ſtand Sentry upon the Ramparts, but they kept themſelves cloſe under cover as much as they could. The Governour could expect no relief, and that I believe was the reaſon why he would not defend the place to the laſt extremity. The <hi>French</hi> could not relieve it from <hi>Flanders,</hi> becauſe they could not make a ſufficient Detachment without hazarding <hi>Ipres,</hi> and other Towns on this ſide; and Prince <hi>Louis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> much about the ſame time, ſo that he could not expect any ſuccour from the Mareſchal <hi>de Lorge,</hi> who was obliged to keep all his Forces againſt Prince <hi>Louis</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> who was on this ſide of the <hi>Rhine</hi> in the Enemies Country. As ſoon as we had taken poſſeſſion of the Caſtle, the Clergy, Religious, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Town went to the chief Church (which has a Chapter conſiſting of a Dean and Secular Canons) where <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung for their deliverance from the <hi>French</hi> Yoke, and for being reſtor'd to their Lawful Prince the Biſhop, but now
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55269:54"/>
(the See being vacant) to the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Liege,</hi> that had the Adminiſtration of the Government, as uſually till the Biſhop Elect had his Confirmation from <hi>Rome.</hi> The Dean and Chapter of <hi>Liege</hi> had likewiſe <hi>Te Deum</hi> ſung in the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>Lambert,</hi> and a triple diſcharge of all the Canon round the Town, to expreſs their joy for the reduction of this place to the Government of <hi>Liege.</hi> But before I part with the Siege of <hi>Huy,</hi> I cannot omit to ſhew the importance and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it to the Allies. We have already ſpoken of the great inconveniences we ſuffered by having <hi>Liege</hi> for our Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Garriſon, which being a very large place, ſituated amongſt Hills, requir'd a good Army for its defence; ſo that whilſt <hi>Liege</hi> was our Frontier, we could not well act defenſively a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Enemy, becauſe it took up thoſe Men within it for its defence which ſhould have been required elſewhere: That very Army which the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> had before it, was but the Garriſon of <hi>Liege,</hi> and ſome Regiments of <hi>Maeſtricht;</hi> and though we exceeded the <hi>French</hi> Army by much, including theſe Forces of <hi>Liege,</hi> yet as long as the <hi>French</hi> had <hi>Huy,</hi> they could ſtill hinder the junction of theſe Forces with us, or elſe the Town of <hi>Liege</hi> muſt be left expoſed to them. But we having advanc'd our Frontier by the taking of this place, a ſmall Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will ſerve <hi>Liege,</hi> and as much as will keep the Citadels will be ſufficient; ſo that by the taking of <hi>Huy,</hi> we can without raiſing One Man, have above Twenty Battalions more in the Field the next Campagne. This is ſufficient to ſhew the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of <hi>Huy,</hi> and of what Importance it is to either ſide.</p>
                  <p>It is now time to return from the Siege of <hi>Huy,</hi> to our Camp at <hi>Rouſelar,</hi> and to bring things to the concluſion of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne. The King, as we have ſaid, left the Army here the 20<hi>th,</hi> and went that day by <hi>Deinſe</hi> and <hi>Ghendt</hi> to <hi>Overmeere,</hi> where His Majeſty lay that night; but at his paſſing by my Lord of <hi>Athlones</hi> Quarters, where the <hi>Dutch</hi> Cavalry was can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd, the King order'd Major-General <hi>Hubert</hi> to go and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Body of Horſe and Dragoons we had by <hi>Aeth,</hi> in the abſence of Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> who (as we have ſaid before) had been taken Prifoner from his very Quarters by a Detachment of the Enemies from the Garriſon of <hi>Mons.</hi>

 The 21<hi>th</hi> the Firſt Troop of Guards, Commanded by my Lord of <hi>Scarborough,</hi> was ſent to quarter at <hi>Breda,</hi> and the Horſe-Granadiers to <hi>Bois le duc;</hi> and now ſome Regiments went off daily from the Camp to go into Winter-Quarters.</p>
                  <p>The 22<hi>th</hi> we made a Detachment to cover our Soldiers, who went to marode up and down the Country; which before occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned many of them to be taken Priſoners by the Enemy; for the Country hereabours abounded in all manner of Fruits, but Roots eſpecially, as Turnips, Parſnips and Potatoes; but when they began to grow ſcarce near the Camp, the Soldiers could not be hinder'd from going farther to gather them, which was the cauſe that the Enemies Parties daily took a great many Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; for which reaſon 'twas thought convenient to have ſet days upon which the Soldiers ſhould have liberty, a Man of a Tent, to go and gather Roots and Fruits, and a Detachment was order'd out of the Army to cover them; but ſome greater inconveniencies happened by this way, for which reaſon 'twas ſince left off. If the Camp at <hi>Rouſelar</hi> was ſtrong and ſecure, ſo that we could make what Detachments we pleaſed from thence, yet in other caſes 'twas very inconvenient; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try all about it was cloſe and Woody, which ſhelter'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Parties, which were ſo frequent that our Sulters under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went great hazards to get Proviſions for the Camp; and our Bread-Waggons were ſeveral times attack<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

 The 23<hi>th</hi> the King, who had left the Camp at <hi>Rouſelar</hi> the 20<hi>th,</hi> came to <hi>Liege</hi> the 23<hi>th</hi> about Noon; His Majeſty was waited upon by Deputies from the Chapter to Complement Him upon his arrival to this place, and by Prince <hi>Cerclas</hi> of <hi>Tilly,</hi> the <hi>Liege</hi> General, and the Cannon was fir'd all round the Town. His Majeſty did not go into the place, but only rid round the Lines and Works to ſee the condition they were in, and how far His Majeſty could depend upon them, whereby to take His Meaſures for the next Campagne. That Evening the King went to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and lay in the Duke of <hi>Holſtein-Ploens</hi> houſe (the Governour) which had been prepar'd for His Majeſties recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the next day the King went on to <hi>Loo,</hi> where His Majeſty arrived the 26<hi>th</hi> to take his uſual Divertiſements after the cloſing of the Campagne.</p>
                  <p>The 25<hi>th</hi> we ſent a reinforcement from the Camp at <hi>Rouſelar</hi> of Thirty Gunners and Matroſſes, with Stores to <hi>Dixmuyde.</hi>

                  <p>The 26<hi>th</hi> the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> left the Army early in the Morning to go to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> 16 Men being commanded out of each Battalion, by Two in the Morning, to Eſcorte his Electoral Highneſs as far as <hi>Deinſe,</hi> from whence relays were ready upon the Road by <hi>Ghendt</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> The Command of the Army remain'd now to the D. of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> who had thereupon the Honours paid him which are given to a General in Chief. The ſame day the Army had Orders to forage all the Churches and Cloiſters in our Front towards the Enemy, and to take all their Corn (as we had before) to leave the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Country hereabouts as bare as we could.</p>
                  <p>The 28<hi>th</hi> the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Foot and Dragoons marched away from the Camp to go into Quarters; they were incamped upon the heighth of <hi>Hooghleode,</hi> where they flank'd our Right, and cover'd the Electors Quarters; but becauſe this Hill commanded our Camp, 5 Battalions of the Brigade of <hi>Rantzow</hi> and <hi>Dedem</hi> were ſent the ſame day to incamp in their places, to defend the Redoubts which we had made at our firſt coming to fortifie this Hill againſt the Enemy. The ſame day the Barracks of the Battalion of the Second Regiment of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guards (whereof my Lord <hi>Cuts</hi> is now Colonel in the room of the late Lieutenant-General <hi>Taldmaſh)</hi> took fire, the wind drove the flame to the Left, where it chanced to be advanced forward to the Front of

 the <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards, or elſe the fire might have done more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in our Straw-Camp, which is very dangerous, when an Army is thus hutted all along in Straw.</p>
                  <p>The 29<hi>th</hi> the D. of <hi>Holſtein-Ploen</hi> came back from the Siege of <hi>Huy</hi> to the Camp, to command the Army; he was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented by all the Generals upon his arrival, and the good ſucceſs he had at <hi>Huy:</hi> the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxemburgh</hi> ſent him a Complement of 2 very fine Mules.

               <p>The 3<hi>d</hi> our Bread-Waggons were again ſet upon by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Parties, and as they made a falſe attack upon the Center of the Waggons, where our Detachment came for relief, they had the opportunity to ſteal ſeveral Horſes from the Front. Our Camp was ſo far towards the Enemies Frontier Garriſons, that <hi>Courtray</hi> was nearer <hi>Ghendt,</hi> from whence we had our Bread, than <hi>Rouſelar.</hi> This, with the cloſeneſs of the ground in our Rear, made the Enemies Parties very ſucceſsful, who had all the advantage they could deſire, for ſuch undertakings. But if the Camp of <hi>Rouſelar</hi> was a perfect Wood when we came to it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that any Regiment could not diſcover the Line upon the Right or Left; yet before we parted with it we made it a Plain, for above half an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile in the Front and Rear. The Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers cut down the Wood and Hedges to build their Huts, and afterwards to burn and make fires withal. 'Twas really pity to ſee many fine Trees and ſtately Oaks cut down, and yet theſe are the leaſt inconveniencies a Country ſuffers, that is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and miſerable ſeat of War. This reflection ought to make us ſet the greateſt value in the World upon our domeſtick Peace, and to let War be any where elſe (whatever it may coſt us) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than have it at home; and if the miſchiefs of War are ſo great, that when <hi>David</hi> was put to his choice of Puniſhments for his Sin, he choſe rather the Peſtilence, or to be chaſten'd by the hand of God, than to have a War at home: Certainly thoſe are to be look'd upon as the moſt unnatural monſters in the world, who would diſturb the Peace of our Government under any pretext whatſoever; and yet ſo much the more when 'tis only to ſatisfie their own ambitious revenge or diſcontent.</p>
               <p>The 5<hi>th</hi> the Regiments that were to be Quartered at <hi>Aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde</hi> marched out of the Field to go to their Garriſon.</p>
               <p>The 6<hi>th</hi> the whole Army began to ſeparate in order to march into Winter-Quarters; the Garriſons of <hi>Bruges, Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Sluys,</hi> marched away under the command of Major-General <hi>Ramſay,</hi> and all the heavy Baggage of the remainder of the Army was ſent away under the Eſcorte of the Regiments of <hi>Noyelles, Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne, St. Paul</hi> and <hi>Marquet,</hi> which marched to <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> and

 the next day the whole Camp broke up at <hi>Rouſetar:</hi> We had a good Rear-guard to cover our March, but the Enemy did not appear to diſturb it; and ſo all the Regiments marched towards their ſeveral Quarters that had been aſſigned them.</p>
               <p>The 9<hi>th</hi> the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxemburgh</hi> came to view our Camp at <hi>Rouſclar,</hi> with the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> and 4000 Horſe of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Houſhold; 'twas ſuppoſed his deſign was to diſturb the Quarters of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalry canton'd about <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muyde;</hi> but my L. <hi>Auverquerque</hi> gave ſuch Orders for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Quarters, that the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxemburgh</hi> did not think convenient to attack them, and ſo he went back again to his Camp at <hi>Courtray</hi> to give Orders for the ſeparation of the <hi>French</hi> Army into their Winter-Quarters, which tho' they had been now above 7 weeks in this Camp, yet they could not ſtir from it till our Army had left the field. My L. of <hi>Athlone</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Cavalry from his Quarters near <hi>Deinſe</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ninove,</hi> to cover the Works we made at this place, and <hi>Gramont</hi> upon the <hi>Dender,</hi> to make them ſerve for a Winter-Quarter, and to lodge our Troops as near as poſſibly we could to the Enemies Frontiers.

               <p>The 14<hi>th</hi> and 15<hi>th</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Army left the Camp of <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi> to go into Winter-Quarters, and the Mareſchals of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh</hi> and <hi>Villeroy</hi> went away for the Court; but the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> ſtaid to take poſſeſſion of his New Government of <hi>Lifle,</hi> and the <hi>French Flanders.</hi>

               <p>About the 16<hi>th.</hi> all the Cavalry and Dragoons left the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages where they were cantoned, to go into their Quarters, and <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> being in a condition of defence, not only the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe and Dragoons marched into Quarters, but the five Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments that had their Quarters aſſigned them in the <hi>Comerlings Ambacht,</hi> which had been ſent here to forward the Work of the Fortification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Count <hi>Thian</hi> ſeparated his Army from <hi>Deinſe,</hi> which was now fortified, and Four Regiments were left in the place under the Command of Brigadier <hi>Offarrel.</hi>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55269:57"/>
ſtate of Affairs, which may ſerve to cloſe up this Narrative. The Scale of War had inclined very much in the former Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnes to <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King has had very great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt the Allies; but the Event of this Campagne is ſufficient to convince them, that if the <hi>French</hi> have had ſucceſs, it has been becauſe they did not make their beſt Efforts in a vigorous proſecution of the common Cauſe: For now, that the Allies have been ſenſible of the neceſſity of augmenting their Forces, we find the Scale to turn. The Enemy, who before were very ſtirring and active upon our Frontiers, have been forced this Year to preſerve their own, and think they have made a good Campagne, when they have been about Eleven Weeks of it imcamped under the Cannon of their own Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; a Month by <hi>Huy,</hi> and above ſeven Weeks between <hi>Courtray</hi> and <hi>Menin;</hi> and yet have not been able to act ſo far defenſively, as to hinder us from taking of <hi>Huy,</hi> a Place of equal importance to both Sides. The Mareſchal <hi>de Lorges</hi> (notwithſtanding the great Matters the <hi>Turks</hi> expected from their Allie againſt the Empire) has been forced to keep on this ſide of the <hi>Rhine</hi> almoſt all the Campagne, and to ſuffer Prince <hi>Lovis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> to paſs this River, and raiſe Contributions in <hi>Alſatia;</hi> and in all likelihood more would have been done, if the apprehenſions we had for <hi>Hungary</hi> at that time, and the ſudden Swelling of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> had not obliged Prince <hi>Lovis</hi> to re paſs the River. The Mareſchal of <hi>Catinat</hi> has done as little in <hi>Savoy;</hi> he has acted wholly upon the defenſive, to ſecure <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Dauphine</hi> from an Invaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There was nothing left but <hi>Catalonia</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> King to talk of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and Victories,</hi> and the <hi>Succeſs due to the Juſtice of his Arms,</hi> which has been his laſt Shift; where he has choſen rather to conſume and ruine an Army by the intemperateneſs of a hot Climate, than want a <hi>Te Deum</hi> in the Great Church of <hi>Paris</hi> to keep up the Hearts of his Subjects. It has appeared by all that has paſſed in this War, that the <hi>French</hi> King loves much more the Laurels that grow in <hi>Flanders,</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> or in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> than thoſe which <hi>Catalonia</hi> affords; ſo that <hi>Gironne</hi> and <hi>Palamos</hi> are but a Shift to cover a weakened Power: And I believe that thoſe who know the ſtate of <hi>Spain,</hi> don't think the <hi>French</hi> King much the greater Conquerour for it: But yet we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55269:58"/>
 have had this Advantage by it, That the <hi>French</hi> King has been forced to diſcover his Weakneſs at Sea, in a Place where he had hitherto rid, <hi>Neptune</hi>-like, Lord and Sovereign of it, and our Fleet no ſooner appeared in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> but the Mareſchal <hi>de Tourville</hi> thought fit to leave that Sea to our Power, and retired into the Habour of <hi>Thoulon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefore it appears by the Event of this Campagne, that the <hi>French</hi> Power and Greatneſs does begin to abate, it ought to give the greateſt incouragement in the world to the Allies, to act ſo much the more vigorouſly in the proſecution of this preſent War. If the Efforts of the <hi>Fren<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch</hi> begin to leſſen, let not ours be the weaker for it; but on the contrary, let them be ſo much the ſtronger, and the more powerful. This will be the way to make a quick and happy End of the War, and to procure a ſolid and laſting Peace, which is the only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Allies propoſe to themſelves in this preſent War; which is ſo juſt, ſo good and laudable, and ſo much becoming Chriſtians, that if we will act our part as we ought to do, we may juſtly expect God's bleſſing upon it. The Experience the World has had of <hi>Lovis</hi> XIV. ſince the beginning of his Reign, is ſufficient to convince all Mankind, that as long as his Power is ſo great, as his Encroachments upon his Neighbours have made it, 'tis in vain to expect a ſolid and durable Peace. If we ſurvey his Hiſtory from the beginning of this Monarch's Reign, we ſhall find, that the longeſt Peace he has had with his Neighbours, has not laſted Seven Years, which was from the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty to 1667. That all along he had invaded the Dominions and States of his Neighbours, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Treaties, though never ſo ſacred; and therefore if we ſhould let this Opportunity ſlip, can we expect a laſting Peace ſo long as he has Power ſufficient to diſturb it when he pleaſes? I dare ſay, that the <hi>French</hi> King's own Subjects, if they value the Peace and Quiet of Chriſtendome, muſt be concerned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and have an intereſt in the common Cauſe of the Allies, which has no other end but to procure it; and conſequently, that they themſelves are ſenſible of the neceſſity of the <hi>French</hi> King's Power to be leſs in order to obtain it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall yet beg leave to addreſs my ſelf to <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, who have ſo great an intereſt in the preſent War, that

our Religion and Liberties cannot be reckoned upon a ſure Baſis, nor our Nation flouriſh, ſo long as the <hi>French</hi> Power is ſo great; therefore 'tis abſolutely our intereſt to uſe our utmoſt endeavours to make it leſs; whatever it may coſt us, yet we cannot pay too dear for it. If we ſhould not take hold of this occaſion, and uſe our utmoſt endeavours to compaſs an End ſo beneficial to the Honour, Safety, and flouriſhing of the Nation, what will our Poſterity ſay of us, when it may be they have thoſe Fetters on which 'tis now in our power to break, nay which is worſe, which we may live to wear our ſelves, and to be wiſe too late? If ſuch miſerable Times ſhould happen through our neglect of this preſent Occaſion, will not our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity curſe our Memory, if we do not live to blame our ſelves for it? If we juſtly condemn our former Governments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have ſuffered <hi>France</hi> to arrive to a Power ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to our Safety and Intereſt, when they might, and ought, to have hindred it, ſhould not we juſtly deſerve the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Character that can be printed upon paper, if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo fair an opportunity as this, to aſſert the Honour and Credit of our Nation, and to Eſtabliſh our own Religion and Liberty upon a ſure Foundation? We make ſo conſiderable a Figure in this preſent War, and <hi>England</hi> has ſuch a ſhare in it, that by our vigorous proſecution of it, we ſhall not only ſecure our Rights and Liberties, but we ſhall have the Credit, under the Care of our Wiſe, Great, and Juſt Monarch, to free the reſt of Chriſtendom from Slavery; which will gain our Nation ſuch a Credit, Renown, and Reputation abroad, as will make <hi>England</hi> flouriſh (when we have compaſſed a Laſting and Solid Peace) more than ever it has done hitherto, and it will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly repay our preſent Charges with Intereſt. And at the ſame time that the <hi>French</hi> King's Efforts are leſs, ſince his Offers of Peace are dayly ſo much the greater, we may reaſonably expect, that if we do our duty as we ought, in this preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, we ſhall ſoon compaſs this wiſh'd for, firm, and Laſting Peace.</p>
