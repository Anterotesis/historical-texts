            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Subject of this Enquiry low in it ſelf, and accordingly apt to be deprest, is yet a part of this State not altogether inconſiderable, ſince it hath formerly engag'd the concern of Perſonages great for Parts and Quality. Onely that Probleme muſt needs have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Topical in it, upon which able men, and well-affected, and on both ſides in
<pb facs="tcp:106270:3"/>
earneſt, are divided; though, perhaps, unequally: the practice of ſome few who had manag'd their own affairs with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and whoſe good meaning is not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bearing up againſt the declar'd ſenſe of many of like unquestionable Prudence. This addreſs in a Cauſe conjectural and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd by Popular Fame, being devested of other Authority from the Reporter then what the matter furniſhes, can onely hope for a Reception, as upon tryal it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it ſelf to you; before whoſe impartial Determination, thoſe ill-grounded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, which have, for theſe not few years, averted many charitable intentions for the incouragement of learning, will abate.</p>

               <hi>Reverend Sir,</hi> That which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this ſmall diſcourſe receiv'd hopes of life from the Right Reverend Lord Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> at that time our Vice-Chancellor,

In the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities are helps of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Examples of accurate performance. The Favors of <hi>Oxford</hi> to me great, as undeſerv'd, not obſcure. All Motives from without command an humble Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Honor eminently to you, which your own inward worth invites. Give your ſelf the importunity with patience to glance over this piece, and allow ſome of the imperfections to difficulties to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances inſuperable: which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, upon a nearer Review, may give way to a right underſtanding through your favourable acceptance.</p>

               <p>Not long after the Queens deceaſe, ſome men of no mean reputation for Wiſdom and place, upon whatever occaſion or ground of conjecture, repreſented theſe foundations as too numerous. The great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancer of learning, purſuant to that preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, labors with King <hi>James</hi> to diſannul <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Will, as to that point of the intended Teaching of Children.

               <p>The firſt neceſſity of raiſing Learned men, is for the Church. About 10000 Pariſhes in England and Wales duely to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with Paſtours.

But work to be ſure directs as to the number of Laborers, though ordinarily reward excite induſtry. He that ſaith <hi>England is over-ſtock'd with Scholars for the proportion of its preferments, and for its employment for Lettred Perſons,</hi> would do well ſeriouſly to conſider who may with any right be term'd a <hi>Scholar</hi>: what is to a modeſt mind <hi>preferment</hi>: and how large the <hi>employment for Lettred Perſons</hi> is in ſo great a Church and State. Suppoſe we therefore firſt adult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients, ſuch as are fit to be employ'd and may need as well as deſerve, to be prefer'd to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence: what, I mean, may not diſcredit their profeſſion, and may comfort them in their labors. Then, not inſiſting, at preſent, upon other of the ſuperiour Faculties, regard we nearly the occaſions of Divinity. This Emploiment is large; as converſant about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Millions of Perſons in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> It is of neceſſity; as wherein the care of Souls is concern'd. It muſt be perform'd with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; fidelity and prudence, as being the Lords work.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106270:34"/>
hundred by which number 15000 Incumben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or Titles being divided, will produce a Quotient of more years then Maſters, after their commencing do uſually attain unto: in which the Succeſſion of Miniſters circulates. But muſt the collation of H. Orders, or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices be <hi>reſtrain'd to degrees</hi>?

               <p>Before this account paſs for evidence it may reaſonably be demanded whether many are not uſ'd in the Church <hi>before any of the compleat degrees</hi> taken.

               <p>But let, whatſoever circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection may, be granted in the chooſing, this good opinion can be no otherwiſe durable then in the right comportment of Town and Maſter, each with the other. In all conditions of life regarding ſettlement and ſociety this obſervation or experiment univerſally recurs that <hi>a fair eſteem may be acquir'd from abroad, must be maintain'd at home.</hi> Now that a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter be able, of ſound principles, and good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is ſuppoſ'd: that he be diligent in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foundations of Religion, and of Arts and Sciences is requir'd: (a task which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Affection to the work can onely make eaſy.) And which will not want its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: that he be dextrous in Teaching and Sagacious in diſcerning the temper of his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are felicities of nature, yet improveable

by experience. Now the former of theſe being ſecur'd, as to the two latter there is a latitude may be ſafely allow'd. <hi>A growing Teacher, is not to be deſpiſ'd.</hi> And perhaps ſuch difference is not with reaſon inſiſted upon by all. True, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great would not ſit to any but <hi>Apelles,</hi> nor be caſt in Braſs by any other, but <hi>Lyſippus:</hi> and though every ones darling, be his little <hi>Alexander,</hi> yet every Age and Place cannot furniſh him an <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for his Tutor. It is not neceſſary that all Towns at all times be ſupply'd with the beſt. He that profeſſeth the Art of Dancing ſhould be well behav'd, of a modeſt garb and meen, nor unready at uſual Dances, the receiv'd Laws and performances of his profeſſion; and then perſons of very good quality may without danger either enter upon learning, or practice with him, what they have elſewhere learn'd: although he be leſs airy, nor ſo abſolute a Maſter of the Foot as ſome others may pretend to be. Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do not all underſtand <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> yet they can read deportment and induſtry either directly in the School-Maſter; or in the more obvious reflexions at home upon their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren committed to his charge.

learning is the nurſe of diligence, bridle of the appetite, exerciſe of unfeign'd humility, and in every condition the ſureſt antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt diſcontent and faction; and therefore they would be deſir'd to think their faithful School-Maſter what in a ſort he is, a fellow-Laborer with their Miniſter: one who hath put on all the affections of the Father, except fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: that ſo by forming a right eſteem of his work, they may ſet a true value upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

               <p>Now becauſe the Patrimony of School-Maſters, for the generality, whether ſmall or ſomewhat greater, being wholly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the cuſtody of Feoffees, muſt needs in the diſpenſing be ſtreightned or enlarg'd u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon motives to the Teacher unavoidable; the matter of <hi>enfeoffement</hi> in this conſideration would not be altogether neglected.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106270:47"/>
whereas, by the way, the Patents laſt age run, <hi>juxta eorum ſanam diſcretionem</hi>: now a <hi>legal will</hi> in a Corporation is different from their <hi>will and pleaſure</hi>: a ſtyle incommunicable to any Subject; for though Soveraigns need not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <hi>declare and remonſtrate,</hi> but reſt often ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with a conſcience of the juſtice of their proceedings, yet is it <hi>an eſſential property of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate authority to render an account.</hi> This abſolute dependance cannot but retard the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, and may endanger to ſhake the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs of the beſt reſolv'd Teacher. Some Founders have nominated <hi>the chief of their Neighbors</hi> to the Government of their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.

But practice rectifies that opinion.

Upon the latter erection of that great School of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> above-mention'd which was <hi>in the thirteenth of the Queen,</hi> the Statutes upon mature deliberation reviſ'd, and a new ſettlement made, it was ordain'd; <hi>the Mayor of the Town and Head-School-Maſter joyn in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the School-lands.</hi> An honeſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſince by that means neither will the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men lie under a temptation to miſconvert the pious uſe, nor ſhall the Maſter be able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the School-Revenue.

               <p>There remains another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of publick Schools: the greateſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to Learners after the Maſter, is <hi>a good Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Before the Art of Printing was diſcover'd, when Books all written by hand were rare, and however leſs correct and compleat to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſ'd at exceſſive rates, thoſe that ſet up Schools in the Provinces of the Empire <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Heathen or Chriſtian, provided themſelves ordinarily with ſome ſtore of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies to promote the common ſtudies of their Scholars with themſelves. And even in that affluence of Books, which this preſent Age daily furniſhes, although a Parent can afford to provide his Son of ſuch as are cheap and port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his preſent uſe as he proceeds in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet there are voluminous Authors, <hi>Pillars
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106270:54"/>
of a Library,</hi> which would highly advance Study, yet are not the purchaſe of every one that is moſt ſtudious: and therefore beſt able to uſe them. In which regard a Library would even at the preſent be reputed a neceſſary Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a School-Houſe.</p>
               <p>This <hi>would not conſiſt of promiſcuous Books.</hi> Engliſh Hiſtories, Treatiſes in Faculties, of Law, Phyſick and Divinity, unſeaſonably read intervert the time due for other ſtudies preparatory to the Scholars daily exerciſe: and therefore Univerſities lay a prudent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint on Artiſts, according to their ſeveral progreſs in the Facultie, to keep ſome years in Seats at the entrance of the publick Library under Books of thoſe Arts about which they are for that time converſant. Some having been queſtion'd how it came to paſs that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages who fram'd the very Theoremes of thoſe Sciences, in compiling and transforming the Syſtemes whereof we ſo much glory, could advance ſo far, have been ready to attribute it to the fewneſs of their Books upon this very account; not without ſome appearance of reaſon, though how truly, I liſt not here farther to enquire.</p>
               <p>Be therefore <hi>onely proper and organical Books hither admitted</hi> and <hi>few of that ſort</hi> would be <hi>excluded.</hi> He is a good Workman, that can uſe every Tool.

and place, prove <hi>helps to proficiency.</hi> Better were it for the peace and comfort of Life if it fell out in matters of higher conſequence that we were never prone to <hi>condemn and inveigh,</hi> where we ſhould rather <hi>limit and caution.</hi> This Book is to be read over, that conſulted onely. This to furniſh matter, that diſpoſition, a third ornament. Words and Phraſes are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to form a diſcourſe; nor a Concordance, to make a Sermon: they do not therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, they may conduce to the Work. <hi>A ſyſtematical Artiſt, is not the worst Artiſt.</hi> They that <hi>always despiſe</hi> helps to perfection may as much prejudice their own profiting, as thoſe that <hi>continually reſt</hi> in them.</p>
               <p>Beſt Editions, as lateſt are ordinarily, may be deſirable, yet former are not to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So much judgement in dealing with the Bookſeller as not to buy corrupt Copies at the rate of the beſt, but at a price vile as they are, is <hi>frugality</hi> in a Scholar: when to be skil'd in the choice of Editions and withal ſo ice as to nauſeat what is not moſt elegant in Print and Binding is <hi>not diſcretion in a poor Student, but Luxury.</hi>

                  <hi>Few Books, well choſen,</hi> may be of much uſe, and the benefaction conſiderable: but becauſe Scholars grow, theſe alſo range themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>ſuitable Claſſes,</hi> and becauſe Schools grow, they may ſpread.

ariſe to a juſt Volume both beyond the bounds and beſides the Nature of this <hi>ſhort Eſſay.</hi> Some Heads of matter it may be nevertheleſs not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to draw over. Therefore conſider we learning in its <hi>Birth, Growth, and Ripeneſs</hi>; and diſtribute we our Scholar into the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, the Linguiſt and Critick; both in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi>

Diſtinct helps to theſe are rather to be ſought then refuſ'd, as Phraſiologies, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, Idioms, directions for the uſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and the like Guides of Imitation. Of which form are Rolls of Names, Gloſſes enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin'd, or ſide by ſide, literal Tranſlations, in a word; <hi>Locks and Keys and Doors of Language</hi> not ſucceſsleſs as may be atteſted by many Late-Learners eſpecially to furniſh fluent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon all Subjects: the <hi>Greek</hi> yet wider in its Dialects and curious in its Tone.</p>

Abridgements too not to be diſparag'd. Match me <hi>L.

               <p>Before the concluſion of this Diſcourſe, it may perhaps fall under ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106270:58"/>
that in this looſe range of enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys, a moſt material point hath been omitted. <hi>Writing an univerſal advantage,</hi> ought certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>to have place in publick and Free Schools.</hi> For though, perhaps, it be <hi>not the principal</hi> bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of that Education, yet <hi>to write</hi> is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and <hi>to write well commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> The truth is in petty Schools (and ſuch are the moſt in every County) no ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be had to it: that the Maſter bring his Scholar to a fair engroſſing <hi>Secretary,</hi> or the neat <hi>Italian</hi> curſive: and if he be deſign'd for the Law to acquaint him with the large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifying <hi>Court hand</hi>: and the leſſer wherein old Rolls are written with their <hi>Abbridgements</hi> would be of ſingular uſe to him. I do not ſay that in the greater Grammar-Schools Maſters can much attend to that buſineſs: yet there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is exacted that the Child bring his <hi>exerciſe written fairly,</hi> as he can, without blots, and without daſhes, the marks of precipitate neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. That cenſure heretofore ordinary as if a bad hand were the property of a good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar may ſeem to have receiv'd its original from ſuch like occaſion. <note n="a" place="bottom">Quicquid Roma legis, quicquid ſtuduiſtis Athenae, Quicquid Chaldaei dogmatis Indus habet; Quicquid Ariſtoteles divino pectore ſenſit, Cumque Platoniſtis Pythagorea cohors; Quicquid ad Elenchos arguto diſputat ore Gallus, &amp; in medicâ jactitat arte Ligur; Creſcit ab auditu: prudens, dociliſque periret Litera, ſi ſurdis auribus eſſet homo.

Books were rare, Scholars took in notes their Maſters Dictates: which that they might more readily diſpatch they practiſ'd <hi>Abbridgements,</hi> and fell into deficient Characters. This habit <hi>improv'd the learning,</hi> but withal <hi>impair'd the writing</hi> of thoſe Ages. A <hi>legible</hi> hand endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd ſeems to carry with it <hi>ſome reſpect</hi> to the Reader: and <hi>eaſy flouriſhes,</hi> in their place add <hi>grace and distinction,</hi> ſometimes <hi>dignity</hi>: but though it be uſeful for all to write, it is not therefore neceſſary for all to embelliſh: yet in Schools deſtin'd to farther Operations, the place for writing though it be not a diſtinct room, would be <hi>furniſh'd with proper Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and ſo <hi>more ſolemn</hi>; and alſo for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Works of Numeration. Whatever of this be needful as to the queſtion in debate, none, I think, in theſe days are of opinion that the skill and practiſe of this Art can be too univerſally propagated: ſome may with reaſon fear it is by many <hi>perverted</hi> from its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt end, when <hi>emploid to the diſcouragement</hi> of other more excellent Arts and Sciences, or <hi>reſtrain'd</hi> in a manner <hi>wholly</hi> to the ſervice of ſecular advantage.</p>

Charity, or to diſcourage the benevolence of others upon this Subject, they would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd withal ſeriouſly to conſider ſeveral Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of inhabitants in this Land, in the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in Factories abroad, the Subject of Paſtoral cure: then to ſet before their eyes with ſuch compaſſion, as the matter requires, the proviſion remaining for many Vicarages: afterwards to deſcend in their inquiſition into the manifold Exigencies of the State, in offices, and Profeſſions requiring men not illiterate. Whether they retain upon the Miniſtery of Juſtice in either Law: or upon the Profeſſion of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> or other polite Arts. The Nation would be reputed, as it is, ample: the traffick copious: the courſe of Juſtice regular: the Cities, and Country populous. Now when <hi>youth</hi> is <hi>multiplied,</hi> ſhould we <hi>diminiſh means of Inſtruction?</hi> when <hi>neceſſities enlarg'd, ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſupplies</hi>? Again on the other ſide they would be deſir'd to meaſure the fluid Body of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities, by Degrees, as it is let out; and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform themſelves whether the number of yearly proceeders upon an indifferent eſtimate may not rather ſeem underproportion'd to the publick occaſions. At the beſt, I fear, they will find many raw Students for want of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient maintenance at the Univerſity thruſt forth upon emploiment before any juſt proof of their proficiency given, who needs muſt bring <hi>weak Shoulders to the weightieſt work</hi>: whereas Counties and Companies of the City

before late calamities and various Troubles of the Age, have exhibited liberally to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of divers at their Studies, what time the Nation enjoid a long peace, as Charities of this nature, if rightly conſider'd, will be found to return upon any Church in fruits of ſound doctrine, and an eſtabliſh'd judgement.</p>
               <p>But <hi>we have too many Eccleſiasticks already</hi>: there are among us who ſay ſo. And indeed do they who have ſuffer'd themſelves to receive ſuch perſwaſion know how many they are in <hi>Spain?</hi> how many they were in <hi>England</hi> in the reign of K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8? do they reckon thus, that however <hi>revenue may vary, the ſame work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides</hi>?</p>
               <p>But have we not Free-Schools in <hi>almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Market-Town?</hi> Did we depretiat benefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions receiv'd: we ſhould be unthankful to God and unjuſt to the memory of many worthy Patriots, ornaments of their Profeſſion, who have ſo far extended theſe proviſions towards the preparing youth for buſineſs religious and ſecular: of which benefit, others more directly, but the whole Country in ſome meaſure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes. Laſtly we ſhould ill deſerve of that Faith, whoſe Charity we diſhonor'd. Yet may it be not unneedful to conſider whether there be not ſtill parts of the Land capable of new Foundations to good advantage. Let not any be offended at the ſeeming multitude of preſent Schools. Certainly we all bear no leſs affection to the <hi>common Chriſtianity,</hi> then

the <hi>Jews</hi> expreſs <hi>to the Law of Moſes,</hi> who have ordain'd <note n="a" place="bottom">R Moſes Maimon: in tract. de ſtudio Legis Cap. 2 Sect. 1.</note> that <hi>School-Maſters be appointed in all Cities, and the inhabitants of that City where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are no Scholars be excommunicated till they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves of School-Maſters. Farther, if upon this they take no care to get them any; then, that City to be executed; ſubjoining this reaſon that the world would not ſubſiſt if it were not for the babling of litle Schoolboys:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, the world would fall from the Law and worſhip of God, and would fall into all diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of manners, were it not for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible emploiment of preventing Children before they can well ſpeak plain, with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtruction in the principles of religion. To the erecting ſuch new Foundations whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall be found wanting, whoſoever ſhall at any time conſult upon the matter will be the rather induc'd, becauſe many Free-Schools at proper diſtances diſpoſ'd, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſter help to the poor, but with all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to the Rich of their Childrens inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution at leſs charges then abroad. One word onely concerning the old Foundations ſubmit we to further regard: the Maſters ſtipend is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually below envy: but what was well ſufficient in the time of Donors though faithfully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenc'd by Feoffees, in fact is now become incompetent of it ſelf for his reaſonable main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; it were for the honor and no leſs for

the advantage of Towns, that he be ſo far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd, at leaſt, as to be enabl'd to attend his Calling without diſtraction, eſpecially if he carry on many to the Univerſity, ſuch as perhaps in all Counties of <hi>England</hi> ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are found to be; ſo will this Church and Nation be bleſt with apt Inſtruments for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and the Age to come ſeaſon'd with a ſenſe of their duty in all capacities.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe conſiderations referr'd alwaies to better judgements, the memory of worthy perſons the former Donors of theſe Charities hath been with us hitherto concluded pretious: their honor ſtands inviolable: nor, till other circumſtances appear, ought we to have a leſs grateful eſteem for preſent Founders, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors and Exhibitors to Students: but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it owing to their pious munificence that many are encourag'd, who may <hi>promote the Peace of the Catholick Church: and be exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of constant loyaltie to their Soveraign, and the Royal Family</hi>: in the proſperity of both which, the welfare of theſe Nations is contain'd.</p>
