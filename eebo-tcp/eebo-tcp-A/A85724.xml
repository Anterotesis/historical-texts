            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>NOt many moneths ſince, <hi>England</hi> was but a great Priſon, where the worſt of men were our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and their vileſt luſts the Laws by which they governed.</p>
            <p>The great and moſt Wiſe God, conveyed divine intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence into Your Patient and Pious Soul, and taught You how by ſuffering for us, to deliver us from our ſufferings; to knock off our ſhackles, and ſet Your People at liberty, when neither Power, nor Policy could effect it. So ſoon as Your Majeſty ſet Your Foot upon Your Engliſh ſhore, our Priſon was turned into a Paradice of Pleaſure, and the whole Nation fill'd with Joy, and Love, and Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> This great Bleſſing is already regiſtred in Your Peoples thankful Hearts; and they deſire that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory thereof might be perpetuated; and therefore they have laid it up amongſt their choiceſt Jewels, and annext

            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Amongſt Your many Illuſtrious Titles, which like fair and beautiful flowers, do adorn and be-deck Your Royal Crown, there's one exceeds and excels all the reſt, as well in Vertue as in Beauty, and that is Your Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith. Sir,</hi> As that Title is Your Honor, ſo the truth of it, is our happineſs. Neither the higheſt Provocations, nor the ſtrongeſt Temptations, that ever Prince met withal, have been able to ſhake Your Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith, nor abate Your holy Zeal; witneſs Your firſt Act, after Your return to the exerciſe of Your Regal Power, in Your early and timely ſuppreſſing Prophaneneſs, and diſcountenancing debaucht perſons, who know not how to expreſs their thankfulneſs unto God for mercies, but by a ſinful drinking them away; a practiſe Your Soul abhors.</p>
            <p>And as it is Your higheſt Honor, to be the Defender of that Faith which we profeſs; ſo it is the greateſt intereſt, prerogative, and priviledge Your Majeſty can be indowed and inveſted withal in this world, and will be Your moſt laſting comfort in the world to come, That God who hath hitherto been a Sun to direct You, will be a Shield to protect You; and that Faith which You defend, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend You againſt all Your enemies maugre the malice of the Devil, and all his wicked inſtruments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Royal Sir,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your eminent Vertues, and thoſe excellent Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that God hath beſtowed upon You, to make You every way worthy and fit for Government, invites us at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168955:3"/>
this time, with joyful hearts, to make our humble addreſſes unto Your Majeſty, and to give You a chearful accompt of our proceedings this Parliament, wherein we have ſpent our whole time upon Publick Bills; ſome we muſt confeſs of very great concernment to Your Majeſty, and all Your People, are not yet ripe, nor brought to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But though like an after-crop, yet with the fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Your Majeſties wonted patience, we hope like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to Inn them well at laſt, to Your Majeſties full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and the great contentment of all Your Loyal and Faithful Subjects.</p>
            <p>Some Bills are paſſed both Houſes, and already lodged here, which attend and wait for Your Majeſties Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and I ſhall humbly beg the favor onely but to touch upon ſome of thoſe of moſt publick concernment, by the way, and <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> to that Bill here in my hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> There is one Bill now before You, intituled, <hi>An Act for the Confirmation of Judicial Proceedings</hi>; the ſcope and intendment of that Bill, is to ſettle Mens Eſtates, which is the way to quiet their mindes; and when their mindes are at reſt, there will be no fear of their breaking the Peace, or forfeiting their Good-behavior any more in time to come.</p>
            <p>There is another Bill, intituled, <hi>An Act to prevent the taking of Exceſsive Uſury.</hi> The reſtraining men of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious mindes, whoſe Conſciences are as large as their Bags, will be a great eaſe to Your People, and an inable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Your Merchants the better to go on with their Trades. They are the Laborious Bees that bring in Honey into Your Majeſties Hive; and Uſurers are the lazy, idle droues, that rob Your Hive of the Honey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:168955:4"/>There is another Bill, Entituled, <hi>An Act for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Anniverſary Thankſgiving to be obſerved and kept upon the</hi> 29 <hi>of</hi> May: A ſay that God himſelf was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to honor and adorn with a new additional Star, never ſeen before nor ſince; a Star of rare aſpect, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to all the world at once, the happy news of Your Majeſties Bleſſed Nativity: And as it was Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Birth-day, ſo it was the day of Your Reſtauration to Your Kingdoms, Parliament, and People: And likewiſe the day of Your Peoples re-Creation out of a Chaos of confuſion and miſery. And therefore they humbly pray, That not only we (for there would need no Act for that ſo long as we live) but that our poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ages that ſhall ſucceed us, might for ever be obliged to ſet apart that day, as a Holy day, to dedicate their Praiſes and Thankſgivings up unto Almighty God for his miraculous Deliverance of this poor Nation, when it lay in duſt and aſhes, in a moſt miſerable, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, forlorn, and deplorable condition.</p>
            <p>There is another Bill, Entituled, <hi>An Act of Free and General Pardon, Indempnity and Oblivion.</hi> It may well be called a Free Pardon: for Your Majeſty was pleaſed to offer it before we had confidence enough to ask it, and at a time when Your People had moſt need of it: And it may as truly be called a General Pardon, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the extenſiveneſs of it. But looking over a long, black, prodigious, diſmal Roll and Catalogue of Malefactors, we there meet not with men, but Monſters, guilty of Blood, Precious Blood, Precious Royal Blood, never to be remembred without tears; incomparable in all the kindes of Villany that ever was acted by the worſt of Miſcreants, perverters of Religion, ſubverters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168955:4"/>
falſe to God, diſloyal to the beſt of Kings, and perfidious to their Countrey: And therefore we found an abſolute and indiſpenſable neceſsity incumbent upon us, to except and ſet ſome apart for Treacle, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the poiſon of Sin and Rebellion out of others, and that they might be made ſacrifices to appeaſe Gods Wrath, and ſatisfie Divine Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And now I am come to that Bill here in my hand, which I am commanded humbly to preſent Your Majeſty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Royal Sir,</hi> Your Commons, the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes now aſſembled in Parliament, taking into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the great and unſupportable Burden of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Navy, that your people do now groane under; and knowing, as Mony is the ſinews of War, ſo as the State of Affairs now ſtand, that 'tis likewiſe the beſt <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> that can be us'd, in order to the attaining that end we have all ſo much deſired, and ſo long prayd for, The ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of a Happy Peace; and therefore they have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this Bill Entituled, <hi>An Act for a ſpeedy Proviſion of Money, to pay off and disband all the Forces of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom both by Sea and Land,</hi> upon which they hope ſuch a Sum will be advanced and brought in, as may be ſufficient fully to diſcharge and diſpatch that work. And they humbly pray Your Majeſties gracious acceptance thereof, and Your Royal aſſent thereunto.</p>
            <p>I am further to inform and aſſure your Majeſty, that Your people have paſſed another Supply and Revenue unto your Majeſty, which far ſurmounteth all they have already done in value, and that is, their Hearts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; having their hearts, your Majeſty may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their purſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:168955:5"/>
               <hi>Moſt Royal Soveraign,</hi> We have nothing more to offer, or to ask at this time, but Your Majeſties gracious favor, ſo ſoon as your Service, and the Publick Affairs will permit, that we might have leave to go into our Countries, where we ſhall make Your people ſenſible of their happineſs, in having ſuch a King to govern and rule over them; and as we praiſe Your Majeſty, ſo likewiſe to pray for your Majeſty, that you may Live long, and Reign proſperouſly.</p>
