         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Anno</hi> 1587, in a single bottom 25000
<hi>Pezos</hi> of the most refined Gold; and

he sack'd St. <hi>Iago, Domingo,</hi> and
<hi>Cartagena</hi> (as before mention'd) and,
carried away with him, besides other

which was a prodigious Spoil
in those early daies, and, when those

in such plenty as now they are. What
shall we say of <hi>Iohn Oxenham,</hi> one of
the <hi>Argo-nauts</hi> with <hi>Drake?</hi> who, in
a slender Bark, near <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi>
(having drawn-up his Vessel to Land,

Massie-Gold, and 200000 in Silver!
though lost in his Return with it, by
the perfidy of his Associates; such an
Exploit is hardly to be parallel'd in
any story. Sir <hi>Richard Grinvill,</hi> in
another Voyage to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> with but
180 Souldiers (of which 90 were sick
and useless) in the Ship <hi>Revenge,</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd

they seem to have ever since subsisted
but upon the Reputation of it; and
the success of our Country-men in

and at different times, they both
unhappily miscarried; yet, they serv'd
to testifie, that neither <hi>Defence,</hi> nor
<hi>Trade</hi> were neglected; since, as to that of
the first, Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> doubts not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98674:44"/>
to affirm; That the <hi>Shipping</hi> of this
Nation, with a Squadron of the <hi>Navy-Royal,</hi>
was in this Princes time, able,
in despight of <hi>Europe,</hi> to Command
the Ocean, much more, to bring the
<hi>Nether-Lands</hi> to due Obedience: But,
says he, as I shall never think him a
lover of his Country, or Prince, who
shall perswade His Majesty from Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating
their Amity; so would I
counsel Them to remember, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it: That seeing their Inter-course
lies so much through the <hi>British</hi>-Seas,
that there is no part of <hi>France,</hi> from
<hi>Calais</hi> to <hi>Flushing,</hi> capable of succour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them; that, frequently, Out-wards
by Western-Winds, and ordinarily,
Home-wards, both from the <hi>Indies,
Straites,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> all Southerly-Winds
(the Breezes of our Climat)
thrust them of necessity into His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Harbours; how much his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
favour does import them: For,
if (as themselves confess) they subsist
by <hi>Commerce</hi> onely; the disturbance
of That (and, which <hi>England</hi> alone
can disturb) will also disturb their
Subsistence: I omit the rest: Because
I can never doubt either their Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
or their Prudence. But, this

brave Man was it seems, no Prophet,
to fore see how soon they would forget
themselves: They began in his days to
be hardly warm in comparison, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is not (as observes the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
much beyond a Century, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>French, Spanish,</hi> or <hi>Hollander,</hi>
had any proper Fleets belonging to

since within these fifty years, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>

Ships at Sea than the <hi>Hollander</hi> (their
Fishing-Buffes excepted) who, 'til fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd

Contemptible, as might be made out by
undeniable Evidence: Insomuch that
the formerly mention'd <hi>Raleigh</hi> affirms,
One Lusty Ship of his Majesties, would
have made forty <hi>Hollanders Strike Sail,</hi>
and come to an Anchor: They did not
then (says he) dispute <hi>de Mari Libero.</hi>
But will you know in a word from him,
what it was that has exalted them to this

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98674:51"/>

taking greater advantage of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
remissness (distracted as they grew

            <p n="50">50. We have but mention'd King

to every Sea, which annually circl'd this
Isle, and as a Monument of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
was sometime Row'd in his

Kings. This Signal Action becoming
the Reverse of a <hi>Medail,</hi> was by a like
device illustrated in the <hi>Rose-Noble,</hi> in
which we have represented the figure of
a King invested with his <hi>Regalia,</hi> stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the middle of a Ship, as in his
proper, and most resplendent Throne;
for the <hi>Same</hi> reason likewise (as some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret)
did <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eight,</hi> add the
<hi>Portcluse</hi> to his current Mony, as a
Character of his peculiar Title to this
<hi>Dition,</hi> exclusive to all others.</p>
            <p n="51">51. We have spoken of the <hi>Danes,</hi>
and <hi>Normans,</hi> and their successive claim,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98674:51"/>
and of the <hi>Custodes Maritimi,</hi> more
antient than that of Admiral, as now
constituted, which indeed began with
the <hi>Edwards,</hi> when the <hi>French,</hi> at war
with <hi>Flanders,</hi> but pretending to usurp
that dignity, were fain to abolish their
new office, and acknowledging they
had no Right, pay the damages of the
depredations they made, as appears by
that famous Record in the Tower, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by Sir <hi>Iohn Burroughs</hi> in which
the Title of our Kings is asserted from
immemorial prescription; nay, when at
this time, he had not all the opposite
Shoar to friend.</p>
            <p n="52">52. The Constitution of our <hi>Cinque-Ports</hi>
give another noble Testimony to
this Claim, and the addition of two
more Admirals by our <hi>Third Edward,</hi>
guarding as many Seas, as there
were Superiour Officers of this deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
not omitting the Title of
<hi>Lords of both Shoars,</hi> anciently us'd
from hence to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fifth;</hi> nay,
when <hi>Edward</hi> renounc'd his Claim to
<hi>Normandy</hi>
               <note place="margin">1166.</note> (as at the Treaty of <hi>Charters</hi>)
the <hi>French</hi> themselves acknowledg'd
this Right, and therefore neither <hi>here,</hi>
nor at the Court of <hi>Delegates</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
did they claim any pretence to the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,

that Universal deference to the Laws of

then belonging to this Crown) publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
after the <hi>Rhodan</hi> had been long
Antiquated, which obtain'd over all
the Christian World. And to this we
might add the <hi>Dane-Gelt</hi> (in plain <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
a Ship-mony Tax) impos'd as well
on Strangers as Denisons that practic'd
Commerce upon our Coasts and Sea;
East and North, where the great <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursus</hi>
was; nor expir'd it here, but
continu'd Customary, as appears by
innumerable Records, for enabling the

or Open them as he saw conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
with Title to all Royal Fishes,

Commissions, and Instruments, and
confirm by precedents, not of our <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal</hi>
constitutions alone, but, such as
have been binding, and accepted for
such, of the Nations about us; Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that famous Accord made between

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98674:59"/>
appear'd to me so dilute, and insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
that 'tis not possible to compose
ones Indignation at the hearing of them,
and see a Kingdom growing every day
thinner of People, and fuller of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
without some extraordinary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion:
To see with what numerous,
and insulting Fleets, our Neighbours
have been often prepar'd to dispute our
Title to these Advantages, by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and supply of that which we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and condemn as unpracticable: If
this be not enough to raise in us some
worthy Resentments; Let the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> themselves incite us
to it; who (in a Proclamation, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
near fifty years since) have stil'd
their <hi>Fishing Trade,</hi> the <hi>Golden Mines</hi>
of their Provinces,<note place="margin">1624.</note> and stimulated an
Industrious and emulous people with
all the Topicks of Encouragement:
Were this alone well consider'd, and
briefly pursu'd, there would need no
great Magick to reduce our bold Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planters
to a more Neighbourly temper:
The Subjects of this Nation have no
more to do, than apply themselves to
the Fishery, to recover at once their
Losses, and as infallibly advance the
prosperity of the Kingdom, as 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98674:59"/>
it has enabled our late Antagonists
to humble <hi>Spain,</hi> and from little of
themselves, to grapple with the most
puissant Monarch of <hi>Europe,</hi> and bring
him to the ground: For my part, I do
not see how we can be able to answer
this prodigious sloath of ours any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and especially, since 'tis evident,
it will cost us but a laudable Industry;
and (in regard of our situation, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many Advantages above them) much
less trouble and charge: Or suppose a
Considerable part of our forrein less<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>needfull
Expences were diverted to
this Work, what were the dis-advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages?
We talk much of <hi>France</hi> (and
perhaps with reason) but are we so safe
from our dear friend, upon this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure,
as never to apprehend any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
unkindness? For my own part, I
wish it with my Soul: But of this I
am sure, We may prevent, or encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
open desiance; but whilst we are
thus undermin'd, we suffer a continual
Hostility; since the Effects of it ruin
our Commerce, and by Consequence
the Nation: Nor speak I here of our
