            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HISTORY
OF
PADRE OTTOMANO,
The first Impostor.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ultan Ibrahim</hi> began his
Reign in the Year 1049,
according to the <hi>Turkish
Hegira</hi> or <hi>Period,</hi> which
was of our Style <hi>Anno
1640.</hi> He was about
nine years <hi>Emperor,</hi> and had born to
him (after the first three years) a <hi>Son</hi>
nam'd <hi>Mahomed,</hi> who is the present
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> now swaying the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Scepter: The <hi>Halaki</hi> or <hi>Great
Sultana</hi> his <hi>Mother</hi> (for by that <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct</hi>
of <hi>Great</hi> she is distinguished from
the rest of that high title) being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54134:10"/>
weak after her <hi>delivery,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
them to seek out, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a fitting <hi>Nurse</hi> for the new-born
<hi>Infant.</hi> But, before we can proceed in
the event of that, some other <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
require the <hi>Readers</hi> attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>It fortun'd that from the Year 1640,
to 44 there liv'd in <hi>Constantinople</hi> one
<hi>Giovanni Iacobo Cesii</hi> native of <hi>Persia,</hi>
but descended from a noble <hi>Family</hi> in
<hi>Rome,</hi> who, being by profession a <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi>
did use to traffique not onely in
this <hi>Port,</hi> but held <hi>commerce</hi> likewise
in divers other places of the <hi>Levant;</hi>
so as being a <hi>Man</hi> of more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>note,</hi> he came at last to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
favour'd by the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi>
chief <hi>Eunuch,</hi> whose name was <hi>Iumbel
Aga,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Keslar Agasi,</hi> a
great <hi>Minion</hi> of <hi>Sultan Murad,</hi> who
deceasing a while after, his following
<hi>Successor</hi> confirm'd to him his former
Charge, which was to take <hi>Care</hi> of
the <hi>Ladies,</hi> who were kept in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>
and <hi>superintended</hi> the <hi>Women</hi>
(for so the <hi>name</hi> imports) nor is the
<hi>dignity</hi> of less esteem than that of the
<hi>Visier</hi> himself, within the precincts of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54134:10"/>
the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> since it intitules him to
the same <hi>Access</hi> to the <hi>Emperour</hi> his
<hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> whom he serves as
<hi>Pimp</hi> of honour; if there be any <hi>true</hi>
honour in so vile an <hi>Employment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Kefler Aga,</hi> Eunuch as he was,
and of no <hi>denomination</hi> for <hi>Sex,</hi> (for his
<hi>Lower-belly</hi> was par'd as smooth as his
<hi>Chin,)</hi> would for all this, be thoughr
a Lover of <hi>Women;</hi> not for his <hi>ability</hi>
and <hi>furniture;</hi> or that he took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in their <hi>Embraces;</hi> but because
it is the <hi>Style</hi> of the <hi>Countrey,</hi> and a
mark of <hi>good breeding</hi> and <hi>Courtly Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was upon this <hi>Occasion</hi> that he one
day sent for <hi>Iacobo Cesii,</hi> and desir'd
that he would search out and purchase
for him the most elegant and handsome
<hi>Wench</hi> he could possibly light upon,
amongst such <hi>slaves</hi> as are daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to <hi>sale</hi> in the <hi>Turkish Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Merchant</hi> was not longbe'r he
happen'd upon a very <hi>beautiful</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of a <hi>modest</hi> Countenance, and, as
near as could be guess'd, a <hi>Virgin.</hi> He
<hi>bought</hi> her, and brought her to the <hi>Aga,</hi>
who being extreamly taken with her
<hi>shape</hi> and <hi>mine,</hi> pay'd him for her 450
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54134:11"/>
               <hi>Dollers,</hi> which was the <hi>Price</hi> she was
valued at. But this pretty <hi>Girle</hi> had,
for all her <hi>simpering</hi> and innocent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
been corrupted, it seems, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she came to the <hi>Eunuch;</hi> and after
some time that she had been with him,
(for he kept her in a <hi>house</hi> of his <hi>own,</hi>
and not in the <hi>Seraglio)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> was suspected
to be <hi>with child.</hi> Her <hi>Lord</hi> was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
importunate to sift out who it was
that might be the <hi>Father</hi> of her <hi>great
belly;</hi> but she would by no means be
induc'd to discover it; which so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed</hi>
him, that the <hi>Aga</hi> forthwith
causes her to be turn'd out of doores;
and thus for some time she remained
in disgrace, though in the house of her
<hi>Major Damo,</hi> to whom he had given
her to be disposed of, till she was at
last <hi>brought</hi> to <hi>bed</hi> of a goodly <hi>Boy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some time after the <hi>Child</hi> was born,
the <hi>Aga,</hi> whether mov'd with <hi>Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
or <hi>Curiosity,</hi> we need not enquire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to discover a most passionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to see the little <hi>Bastard;</hi> which was
no sooner brought to him, but being
exceedingly pleas'd with the <hi>Babe,</hi> he
immediately orders it a rich <hi>Vest,</hi> and
other fine things to wear, though it was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54134:11"/>
then not above <hi>eight</hi> or <hi>nine</hi> moneths
old; commanding that it should still
be kept in his <hi>Stewards</hi> house, where
it was born.</p>
            <p>It fortun'd, that not long after was
the <hi>Birth</hi> of the present <hi>Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour;</hi>
and the <hi>Great Sultana</hi> (as we
said) being indisposed, The <hi>grand Aga</hi>
was sent for to provide a <hi>Nurse</hi> for the
young <hi>Prince,</hi> that care belonging like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
particularly to his <hi>charge:</hi> Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
the <hi>Aga</hi> reflects upon his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grac'd
<hi>Slave,</hi> whom he speedily sent for
to him, and brought to Court, (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with her pretty <hi>By-blow,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Padre Ottomano)</hi> recommending
her for a <hi>Nurse</hi> to the <hi>Royal Infant,</hi>
upon which account she stay'd near <hi>two</hi>
whole <hi>years</hi> in the <hi>Seraglio: Sultan
Ibrahim</hi> (father of the young <hi>Prince)</hi>
during this time grew so taken with
the <hi>Nurses</hi> Boy, as being much a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
<hi>CHILD</hi> than his <hi>own,</hi> that he grew
infinitely <hi>fonder</hi> of him; which so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
and displeas'd the <hi>Great Sultana,</hi>
that being now no longer able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
her <hi>Resentment,</hi> she grew in
<hi>wroth</hi> with <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and gave a <hi>second</hi>
and more cruel <hi>exilement</hi> to the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54134:12"/>
               <hi>Nurse,</hi> and her darling <hi>Child;</hi>
whom she banish'd out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi>
and could never after abide the <hi>Aga</hi>
that introduc'd them.</p>
            <p>This violent <hi>action</hi> of the <hi>Sultana</hi>
made, you may imagine, a foul house
in the <hi>Court,</hi> and it grew at last to that
<hi>height,</hi> that the <hi>Emperour</hi> (who took
it greatly to heart, his pretty <hi>Favorite</hi>
should be thus thrown out of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>
running one day to the <hi>Sultana,</hi>
he snatches his <hi>son</hi> out of her arms,
and threw him into a <hi>Piscina</hi> or large
<hi>Fountain,</hi> which was near them, where
he had like to have been <hi>drown'd.</hi>
This passionate and unnatural action
of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> inrag'd the <hi>Sultana</hi> now
more then ever against the <hi>Aga,</hi> so as
she sought all occasions possible to
put him to death, as imputing the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature
of her Lord the <hi>Emperour</hi> to
some wicked impressions of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite;</hi>
but chiefly, for his bringing
the fair <hi>Slave</hi> and her <hi>Bastard</hi> into the
<hi>Seraglio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The continual hatred and <hi>machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the <hi>G. Sultana</hi> caused the <hi>Aga</hi>
to consult his safety; and besides, he
was not a little apprehensive of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54134:12"/>
               <hi>capricious</hi> and unconstant <hi>humour</hi> of
<hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who being of a weak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
and understanding, he feared
might in time be wrought upon by the
<hi>Sultana</hi> to destroy him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
makes suit to the <hi>Emperour</hi> that
he would permit him to go on <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>
to <hi>Mecha,</hi> since <hi>Absence</hi> might
possibly mitigate her <hi>fury;</hi> and for
that he was now grown <hi>aged,</hi> and
less capable of doing him <hi>service</hi> in
his <hi>charge,</hi> which he desired he would
give him leave to resign.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> finding him by long
<hi>experience</hi> to be a <hi>discreet Person,</hi> and
one that had faithfully served the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi>
his Brother, would by no means
hearken to his <hi>Request,</hi> or permit him
to go from him; since as the <hi>constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> stands, That had
been to have for ever depriv'd him of
a <hi>Servant,</hi> whom he so dearly loved.
For you are to understand, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
obtains leave to go that holy <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,</hi>
is <hi>ipso facto</hi> made <hi>free;</hi> No
<hi>Eunuch</hi> belonging to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Slaves</hi> of <hi>honour</hi> to the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior)</hi>
can obtain his <hi>Liberty,</hi> but by
the <hi>Emperours</hi> especial Grace; which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54134:13"/>
also entitles him to a certain <hi>Annual
Pension,</hi> arising from the <hi>Revenue</hi> of
<hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> set apart for such <hi>Rewards:</hi>
And for this <hi>reason</hi> it was, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
was very unwilling to part with his <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch:</hi>
However, being <hi>vanquish'd</hi> at
last with his continual <hi>importunity,</hi> and
for that it was upon <hi>condition,</hi> that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the <hi>Custom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Seraglio</hi> in such Cases, he should go
but as his <hi>slave,</hi> and having perform'd
his <hi>Devotion,</hi> return to him again, and
to the Office which he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd;
he grants him his <hi>Request.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <hi>stipulation</hi> he dismisses his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,</hi>

touch'd a while at <hi>Scio</hi> (an <hi>Island</hi> in

caus'd him to be immediately <hi>burnt</hi>

they discover six <hi>Gallies:</hi> It fortun'd
to be a great <hi>Calme,</hi> and yet they were

that were making towards
them, they seem'd not to be so much
concern'd: But when a little after they
came to find their <hi>Mistake,</hi> and that they
belonged to <hi>Malta,</hi> they were strangely
<hi>surpriz'd,</hi> and in great confusion what to
resolve on; for divers <hi>Vessels</hi> of their

where they might find their

they would come up to their <hi>Conditions.</hi>
For though she were <hi>dead</hi> in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi>
yet it seems they had either drest
up a <hi>Property</hi> to Personate her amongst
the <hi>She-slaves</hi> that were taken, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have it believed so, and both
her <hi>own,</hi> and the <hi>Portrait</hi> of her young

sold in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> for the

after long <hi>expectations,</hi> receiving no

they were to the very Year 1649.
But how farr this contributed to the
<hi>Quarrel</hi> with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whom they
unexpectedly <hi>surpriz'd</hi> soon after,
will be made appear by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel.</p>
            <p>It was in this <hi>Year</hi> that the <hi>Person</hi>
who gives us this <hi>Information</hi> (return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Rome,</hi> where he had finish'd
his <hi>Studies</hi> in the Colledge <hi>De Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda

<hi>Persia,</hi> happen'd in his Journey to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at <hi>Malta;</hi> where making some
stay, he came to be <hi>known</hi> to divers of
the <hi>Order,</hi> and principal Persons <hi>there;</hi>
as namely to the <hi>Treasurer,</hi> several of
the <hi>Grand Croci,</hi> to the <hi>Great Master</hi>
himself, the <hi>Commandator,</hi> the <hi>General</hi>
of the <hi>Gallies,</hi> and most of the <hi>Nobility</hi>
there. The <hi>Grand Master</hi> was then <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes

Monsieurde la Helle,</hi> the <hi>General Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Beauchamp,</hi> &amp;c. to omit the rest.
These enter into a Solemn <hi>Consultation,</hi>
what was to be done to fift out the
truth, and value of their <hi>Prize;</hi> that is,
to know whether the <hi>Child</hi> were indeed

and the <hi>Customes</hi> of their <hi>Country,</hi>
and for some other <hi>Relations</hi> of his at

good Markes of his capacity and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
they resolve to dispatch him
forthwith to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed

            <p>
               <hi>Signior Pietro</hi> (for so we will now
call him) Sailes from <hi>Malta,</hi> arrives
at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> makes <hi>Friends</hi> in
the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> enquires with all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
imaginable, Whether any <hi>Child</hi>
of the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> were missing?
and whether it were true, that the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saki,</hi>
or Great <hi>Sultana,</hi> had some years
since been lost, or taken by the <hi>Malte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes</hi>
in her <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> towards <hi>Mecha?</hi>
&amp;c. But after all the <hi>dilligence</hi> he
could possibly make, he could never
discover any likelihood, or so much as
shadow of it: In sum, he finds there
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54134:16"/>
was not a syllable of it <hi>true;</hi> and that
the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Malta</hi> had all the while
but <hi>abused</hi> themselves in their <hi>Creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and all <hi>Christendom</hi> in the <hi>Report</hi> of
it. <hi>Pietro</hi> writes back to the <hi>Religion,</hi>
and assures them by many indubitable
<hi>Evidences,</hi> nay <hi>Oathes</hi> and <hi>Affidavit's,</hi>
which he had procur'd, and several
other <hi>Effects</hi> of his dilligence, that it
was all <hi>Imposture,</hi> and that they ought
to give <hi>credit</hi> to the <hi>Romance</hi> no longer,
or hope for the least advantage by it:
This was in the Year 1650; for so <hi>long,</hi>
and somewhat <hi>longer</hi> it was, e'r they
would be dis-abus'd: And now at
last they begin to <hi>defend</hi> themselves,
and by little and little to let their boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dye, and to neglect any farther <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi>
to their pretended <hi>Royal Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi>
In short, they now grew very
cold, hardly made any more <hi>account</hi> of
him; Yet so, that having for a long
time abus'd the World, as asham'd at
their <hi>credulity,</hi> and to prevent <hi>reproach,</hi>
they continually endeavour'd to have it
still <hi>thought</hi> true; and therefore gave
the <hi>Boy</hi> the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Ottomano,</hi> which he
weares to this day, <hi>Non per dignitatem</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54134:17"/>This is the <hi>true</hi> and real <hi>History</hi> of
the so much talk'd-of <hi>Padre Ottomano,</hi>
and consequently of that groundless
and vulgar <hi>Opinion,</hi> which has been
spread so long about, that this <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
alone was the onely <hi>sourse</hi> and <hi>cause</hi>
of the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Quarrel with the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> but of which there is so little
appearance; the <hi>Interest</hi> of that <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
being so different from <hi>that</hi> of the
<hi>Maltezes,</hi> who are Sworn never to be at
<hi>Peace</hi> with those <hi>Miscreants;</hi> whil'st the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> on the contrary, were in a
profound, and un-interrupted <hi>League</hi>
with them.</p>
            <p>It is indeed commonly pretended,
that contrary to a <hi>stipulation</hi> with the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
the <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Malta,</hi> after this
<hi>Exploit</hi> of Surprizing the <hi>Sultana</hi> and
her <hi>Son,</hi> going with an infinite Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to <hi>Mecha;</hi> but the <hi>truth</hi> is, finding
no occasion to Commence the <hi>War</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <hi>suggestion,</hi> they give out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and which is believed was the more
real ground of it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>reign</hi> of <hi>Sultan Amorat,</hi> there
were <hi>destroy'd</hi> and <hi>burnt</hi> by the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
no less than five and twenty

who were <hi>Rovers</hi> and <hi>Pyrats</hi> upon those
<hi>seas,</hi> and greatly infested the <hi>Commerce;</hi>
These they attaqu'd in the <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velona,</hi>
demolishing withal their <hi>Castle:</hi>
Complaint hereof being made to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rud,</hi>
he was provok'd to declare <hi>War</hi>
against them as the first <hi>Aggressors;</hi>
though in truth this had been no <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
of any <hi>Article</hi> between them:
However, upon their earnest instigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Amurat</hi> seems highly to resent the
<hi>Affront,</hi> as done against his <hi>Allies;</hi>
Hereupon the <hi>Venetians</hi> offer to give
them two <hi>Galeasses</hi> in <hi>satisfaction,</hi> and
to pay for all the <hi>losse</hi> which they had
sustain'd. But in this interim the <hi>Grand

dyes soon after his return, and leaves
the <hi>Quarrel</hi> to his <hi>Brother Isruhim;</hi> who,

of this <hi>War</hi> to his Son <hi>Mahomed,</hi> who
has continued it to this present day. By
what <hi>Accident</hi> the <hi>Maltezes</hi> contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the fatal rousing of this immane
Lyon we have seen, but without the
least appearance of intituling it to the
Merit of this <hi>supposititious Child</hi> and his
<hi>Mother,</hi> upon which yet it is so vulgarly
and so weakly founded.</p>
            <p>But what may farther elucidate the
utter <hi>impossibility</hi> of <hi>Padre Ottomano</hi>'s
Title, as <hi>Heir</hi> to that <hi>Family,</hi> 'tis noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
known, that the last <hi>Emperor</hi> of

they are never allow'd to stir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
but in company of the <hi>Grand
Signior,</hi> and under the strictest guard:
Next, that no <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
blood, or the <hi>Sultana</hi> her self, does ever
<hi>Travel</hi> to any place whatsoever out of
the <hi>Palace,</hi> but when the <hi>Emperor</hi> goes
himself in <hi>Person.</hi> This being so, how
probable and likely it is, he should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
the <hi>Great Sultana,</hi> and the <hi>Heir</hi> of
the <hi>Crown</hi> in a weak and ordinary <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan,</hi>
with so small an <hi>Equipage,</hi> and

never so much as to <hi>treate</hi> about their
<hi>Release,</hi> &amp;c. let any rational Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
upon mature <hi>consideration,</hi> and
prospect of the <hi>Circumstances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, as our <hi>Intelligence</hi> argues and
assures us, those of <hi>Malta</hi> are so insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiably
<hi>covetous,</hi> that if they could sell
even the very <hi>Maltezes</hi> themselves,
they would not stick to make <hi>Money</hi> of
them; and that it is familiar with these
Holy <hi>Corsaires,</hi> to spoil all the <hi>Oriental
Christians,</hi> without distinction, who
come in their way; neither regarding
their <hi>Faith,</hi> nor their <hi>Profession:</hi> So as
when ever they surprize any miserable
<hi>Slaves,</hi> who for the diead of <hi>torment</hi>

have been forc'd to turne <hi>Renegadoes;</hi>

had it been to their <hi>Advantage,</hi> to have

which was the <hi>Rendezvous</hi> agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and where he had appointed to
meet him upon the first opportunity
of totally renouncing the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors</hi>
Service, to declare himself the
<hi>Christian,</hi> which he had hitherto but
disguiz'd. <hi>Chamonsi</hi> (for so was this

his <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Benefactor</hi> at the place

design'd, plotted with the Governour
of <hi>Moldavia</hi> to have perfidiously sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
and slain him; but our <hi>Don
Herchio Bei,</hi> after wondrous proofs of
his valour, and giving death to almost
all that oppos'd him, escapes their
hands, though extreamly wounded;
In this plight, he meets with a poor
<hi>Shepherd,</hi> with whom he changes his
<hi>Princely Robes</hi> for the <hi>Shepherds</hi> Gray
Coat, and travels on his ten-toes a
tedious and unknown way for many
days together. In this unfortunate
<hi>Encounter</hi> it was that he lost his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Counsellour,</hi> another <hi>Iesuite,</hi> and all
his glorious <hi>Retinue,</hi> who were every
one of them <hi>kill'd</hi> upon the Spot,
save one poor honest <hi>Iew,</hi> and in this
lamentable condition came our devout
<hi>Prince</hi> on <hi>Foot,</hi> and in the <hi>Snow</hi> to the
<hi>Cossaque</hi> Army, then in hostility against
the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> amongst whom he found
three <hi>Souldiers</hi> that he had formerly
freed from <hi>Turkish Captivity.</hi> These
were the first who made his <hi>Quality</hi>

at <hi>Rome,</hi> and receive that <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

and despises him, whom he had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the <hi>Prince</hi> steals secretly away from the

vertuous <hi>Iew,</hi> (who likewise
knew him) he at last got safe into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

approach, and illustrious quality, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
him (as himself relates it) with
infinite respect; and, in fine, prevails
with him to honour the <hi>Cathedral</hi> of

a <hi>Voluntier,</hi> but by fighting hand to

whom he kill'd upon the Spot before

            <p>This impudent <hi>Vagabond</hi> then, and
pretended <hi>Mahound Bei,</hi> that has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
abused the <hi>French</hi> King, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
he should have done the same to
his Majestie of <hi>England,</hi> is in fine a
<hi>Natives</hi> of <hi>Walachia,</hi> born of Christian
Parents in the City of <hi>Trogovisti:</hi> They
were formerly very opulent and well to
pass, and his <hi>Father</hi> in good esteem
with the Prince <hi>Matthias Vaivoda</hi> of
<hi>Moldavia.</hi> His Father dying, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Cigala</hi> was taken into the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>
of the <hi>Prince,</hi> as his Father had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54134:25"/>
been before him, and sent in the <hi>Retinue</hi>
of his <hi>Resident</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi> about
<hi>twenty years</hi> since; After some time
spent there, he returns into his <hi>Countrey,</hi>
where he grew intimately acquainted
with a <hi>married Priest</hi> (as in that place
they are permitted to be) and made love
to his <hi>Wife;</hi> but the <hi>Woman,</hi> the better
to colour and conceal the familiarity
and courtship that was between them,
makes her <hi>Husband</hi> believe he had a
kindness for her <hi>daughter,</hi> and in so
honorable and decent a way, that the
simple man believes her, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
him more like a <hi>Domestique</hi>
now than a <hi>Lover,</hi> suffers him even
to govern his little Family. But it
seems our rampant <hi>Amoroso</hi> could not
so govern himself, but the <hi>Priest</hi> began
to suspect and discover his <hi>Villany;</hi> for
either he did, or would have lain with
both <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Daughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this he is complained of to
the <hi>Vaivoda,</hi> who sought all means pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to have <hi>apprehended</hi> and <hi>executed</hi>
him according to their Law; and that
not only for this his <hi>Inhospitable</hi> Crime;
but for sundry other most notorious
<hi>delicts</hi> and <hi>misdemeanors,</hi> of which he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54134:25"/>
had been formerly convicted. But, it
seems, having timely notice of it, he
gets away again to <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
where he remained till the decease of
Prince <hi>Matthias,</hi> after which he comes
back impudently into <hi>Walacria</hi> again,
thinking all had been now <hi>forgotten,</hi>
and that by some <hi>Address</hi> or other, he
might procure to be receiv'd amongst
the <hi>Great men</hi> of his Countrey; but
when upon some <hi>Attempts</hi> that he
made, he perceived they had discovered
who he was, and would have laid hold
on him, and <hi>chastiz'd</hi> him for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Insolencies;</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi> he
retires a third time, where despairing
after a while of his <hi>designs</hi> at <hi>home,</hi> he
makes himself <hi>Turk,</hi> and turns perfect
<hi>Renegado.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since these <hi>Exploits</hi> he has <hi>rang'd</hi>

OF
SABATAI SEVI,
The Pretended
Messiah of the Iewes,
In the Year of our Lord, 1666.
The Third Impostor.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of several <hi>Christian</hi>
Writers, especially of
such who Comment on
the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
this Year of 1666 was to prove
a Year of Wonders, of strange Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
in the World, and particularly
of Blessing to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their Conversion to the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Faith, or of their Restoration to their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54134:30"/>
Temporal Kingdome: This Opinion
was so dilated, and fixt in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
of the Reformed Religion, and in
the Heads of Phanatical <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi>
who Dreamed of a Fift Monarchy, the
downfall of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Antichrist,</hi>
and the Greatness of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> In so
much, that this subtile People judged
this Year the time to stir, and to fit
their Motion according to the season of
the Modern Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies; whereupon
strange Reports flew from place to
place, of the March of Multitudes of
People from unknown parts into the
remote Desarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> supposed to
be the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> and <hi>halfe,</hi> lost for so
many Ages. That a Ship was arrived
in the Northern parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> with
her Sailes and Cordage of Silke, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigated
by Mariners who spake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Hebrew;</hi> with this Motto
on their Sailes, <hi>The Twelve Tribes of
Israel.</hi> These Reportes agreeing thus
near to former Predictions, put the
wild sort of the World into an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of strange Accidents, this year
should produce in reference to the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
Monarchy.</p>
            <p>In this manner Millions of People
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54134:30"/>
were possessed, when <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> first
appear'd at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and published him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the <hi>Iewes</hi> for their <hi>Messiah,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the greatness of their approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kingdome, the strong hand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God was about to deliver them from
Bondage, and gather them from all
partes of the World. It was strange
to see how the fancy took, and how fast
the report of <hi>Sabatai</hi> and his Doctrine
flew through all partes where <hi>Turkes</hi>
and <hi>Iews</hi> inhabited; the latter of which
were so deeply possessed with a beliefe
of their new Kingdome, and Riches, and
many of them with promotion to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Government, Renown, and
Greatness, that in all parts from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
to <hi>Buda</hi> (which it was my
fortune that year to Travel) I perceiv'd
a strange transport in the <hi>Iewes,</hi> none of
them attending to any business unless
to winde up former negotiations, and
to prepare themselves and Families for a
Journey to <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> All their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
their Dreames, and disposal of
their Affaires tended to no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
but a re-establishment in the Land
of Promise, to Greatness, Glory, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and Doctrine of the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:54134:31"/>
whose Original, Birth, and Education
are first to be recounted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> was Son of <hi>Mordechai
Sevi,</hi> an Inhabitant, and Natural of
<hi>Smyrna,</hi> who gained his Livelihood by
being <hi>Broaker</hi> to an <hi>English</hi> Marchant
in that place; a person, who before
his death was very decrepit in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and full of the Goute, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
but his Son <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
himself to Study, became a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Proficient in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks;</hi>
and arrived to that point of
<hi>Sophistry</hi> in <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi>
that he vented a New Doctrine in their
Law, drawing to the Profession of it so
many Disciples, as raised one day a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
in the <hi>Synagogue;</hi> for which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he was by a Censure of the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hams</hi>
(who are Expounders of the
Law) banished the City.</p>
            <p>During the time of his Exile, he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ravelled to <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> now called
<hi>Salonica,</hi> where he Marryed a very
handsome Woman; but either not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that part of Oeconomy as to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
a Wife, or being Importent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Women, as was pretended, or
that she found not favour in his Eyes,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54134:31"/>
she was divorced from him: Again,
he took a second Wife, more beautiful
then the former, but the same causes
of discontent raising a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, he obtained another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
from this Wife also. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now free from the Incumbrances of
a Family, his wandring Head mov'd
him to Travel through the <hi>Morea,</hi> thence
to <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Syria, Gaza,</hi> and <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
and by the way picked up a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernese</hi>
Lady, whom he made his third
Wife, the Daughter of some <hi>Polonian</hi>
or <hi>German,</hi> her Original and Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
not being very well known. And
being now at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> he began to
Reforme the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and
Abolish the <hi>Fast</hi> of <hi>Tamnz</hi> (which
they keep in the Moneth of <hi>Iune)</hi> and
there meeting with a certain <hi>Iew</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Nathan,</hi> a proper Instrument to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
his Design; he communicated
to him his Condition, his Course of
Life, and Intentions, to Proclaime him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>Messiah</hi> of the World, so long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
and desired by the <hi>Iewes.</hi> This
Design took wonderfully with <hi>Nathan;</hi>
and because it was thought necessary
according to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and Antient <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:54134:32"/>
that <hi>Elias</hi> was to precede the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> as St. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was the
fore-runner of <hi>Christ: Nathan</hi> thought
no man so proper to Act the Part of
the <hi>Prophet</hi> as himself; and so no
sooner had <hi>Sabatai</hi> declared himself the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> but <hi>Nathan</hi> discovers himself
to be his Prophet, forbiding all the
Fasts of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and
declaring, that the Bridegroom being
come, nothing but Joy, and Triumph
ought to dwell in their Habitations;
Writing to all the Assemblies of the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> to perswade them to the same
beliefe.</p>
            <p>And now the Schisme being
begun, and many <hi>Iewes</hi> really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
what they so much desired, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
took the courage and boldness to
Prophesie, That one Year from the
27th of <hi>Kislen,</hi> (which is the moneth of
<hi>Iune)</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> shall appear before the
<hi>Grand Signor,</hi> &amp; take from him his Crown,
and lead him in Chaines like a Captive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sabatai</hi> also at <hi>Gaza</hi> Preached Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and Obedience
to Himself and Doctrine, for that the
coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was at hand:
which Novelties so Affected the <hi>Iewish</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:54134:32"/>
Inhabitants of those partes, that they
gave up themselves wholly to their
Prayers, Almes, and Devotions; and to
confirme this beliefe the more, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that at the same time that Newes
hereof, with all perticulars were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
from <hi>Gaza,</hi> to acquaint the
Brethren in Forrain Partes: The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the <hi>Messiah</hi> hath flown so swift,
and gained such reception, that Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
came from all Partes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
where the <hi>Iewes</hi> inhabit, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to <hi>Gaza,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the happiness of their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and expiration of the time of
their Servitude, by the Appearance of
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> To which they adjoyned
other Prophesies, relating to that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to have over all
the World: that for Nine Moneths
after he was to disappeare; during
which time the <hi>Iewes</hi> were to suffer, and
many of them to undergoe Martyrdom:
but then returning again Mounted on
a Caelestial <hi>Lyon,</hi> with his Bridle made
of <hi>Serpents</hi> with seven heads, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
with his Brethren the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who
Inhabited on the other side of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

and then the <hi>Holy Temple</hi> should
descend from Heaven already built, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

should offer Sacrifice for ever.</p>
            <p>And here I leave you to consider,
how strangely this Deceived People
was Amused, when these Confident,
and vain Reports, and Dreams of Power,
and Kingdomes, had wholly transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them from the ordinary course of
their Trade, and Interest.</p>
            <p>This noise and rumour of the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
having begun to fill all places, <hi>Sabatai
Sevi</hi> resolved to Travel towards <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
the Country of his Nativity; and
thence to <hi>Constantinople</hi> the Capital
<hi>City,</hi> where the principal Work of
Preaching was to have been perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:

that they stay'd not for the Sentence

that having for the space of seven dayes

taken no sustenance, were famished to

Business was laid aside, none Worked,

sold it for what he could; but

from Bargaines or Sales, on the

all Business and Imployment was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed

But because every one was not Master

ground dayly; and the Grand <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham</hi>
with his Party, losing both the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

displaced from his Office, and another

a man of a good estate and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who arguing in the

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54134:40"/>
or the doctrine of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> raised
such a sedition and tumult amongst

were for a time possessed, and
voices heard to found from their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks,

their visions of the <hi>Lion</hi> of

or slight of hand would have
passed more easily with with them for a
wonder than <hi>Moses</hi> striking the rock
for water, or dividing the <hi>red sea.</hi>
And occasion happening that <hi>Sabatai</hi>
was, in behalf of his Subjects, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before the <hi>Cadi,</hi> or judge of the
Citie to demand ease, and relief of
some oppressions which aggrieved
them: It was thought necessary a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle

appearing with a formal and <hi>pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical</hi>

on: Some on a sudden avouched to
see a pillar of fire between him and
the <hi>Cadi,</hi> which report presently was
heard through the whole room, filled
with <hi>Iews</hi> that accompanied <hi>Sabatai,</hi>
some of whom, who strongly fancied
it, vow'd, and swore they saw it;
others in the outward yard, or that
could not come near to hear, or see
for the crowd, as speedily took the
alarm, and the rumour ran, and belief
receiv'd by the Women and Children
at home in a moment, so that <hi>Sabatai
Sevi</hi> returned to his house triumphant,
fixed in the hearts of his people, who
now needed no further Miracles to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54134:42"/>
confirm them in their faith. And thus
was <hi>Sabatai</hi> exalted, when no man
was thought worthy of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
who did not believe him to be
the <hi>Messiah:</hi> others were called <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrim,</hi>

render his design suspected by any act

thus fully fixed himself in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and
filled other places with rumors of his

God to visit <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the

at the reports and prophesies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

took few into the Vessel to him, yet a
multitude of <hi>Iews</hi> travell'd over land
to meet him again at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> on
whom all their Eyes and Expectations
were intent. The wind proving nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernly,
as commonly it is in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lespont</hi>

nine days in his voyage, and yet
the Vessel not arriv'd, so little power
had this <hi>Messiah</hi> over the Sea and

to receive him with the same
Joy and Impatience as was exprest in

some rumors of this man, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order

whil'st the <hi>Saick</hi> was detained by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

to remain in farther expectation of the
<hi>Viziers</hi> sentence: The <hi>Iews</hi> were not
at all discouraged at this ill treatment
of their prophet, but rather confirmed
in their belief of him, as being the
accomplishment of the prophesie of
those things which ought to precede
his glory and dominion; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
induc'd the chiefest persons
amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> to make their visits
and addresses to him with the same
ceremony and respect in the Dungeon
as they would have done had he then
sat exalted on the throne of <hi>Israel:</hi>
several of them, with one <hi>Ana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Iews,</hi> attended a whole day before

               </gap>s) the undecency of the
place, and present subjection, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the least abated their high
thoughts, and reverence towards his
person. The <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Constantinople</hi>
were now become as mad and distracted
as they were in other places, all trade
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54134:44"/>
and trafficque forbidden, and those
who owed money, in no manner care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
how to satisfie it: amongst which
wild crew some were indebted to our
Merchants at <hi>Galata,</hi> who not knowing
the way to receive their money, partly
for their interest, and partly for curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
thought fit to visit this <hi>Sabatai,</hi>
complayning that such particular <hi>Iews,</hi>
upon his coming, took upon them the
boldness to defraud them of their right,
desired he would be pleased to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to these his Subjects, his pleasure
to have satisfaction given: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Sabatai</hi> with much affectation
took Pen and Paper, and wrote to
this effect.</p>
            <p>TO you of the Nation of
the <hi>Iews,</hi> who expect the
appearance of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and
the Salvation of <hi>Israel,</hi> Peace
without end. Whereas we are
informed that you are indebted
to several of the <hi>English</hi> Nation:
It seemeth right unto us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54134:44"/>
you to make satisfaction
to these your just debts: which
if you refuse to do, and not
obey us herein: Know you, that
then you are not to enter with
us into our Joys and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>In this manner <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
a Prisoner at <hi>Constantinople</hi> for
the space of two Moneths; at the end
of which, the <hi>Vizier</hi> having designed
his expedition for <hi>Candia;</hi> and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the rumor and disturbance the
presence of <hi>Sabatai</hi> had made already
at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> thought it not secure
to suffer him to remain in the Imperial
Citie, whil'st both the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
and himself were absent: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
changes his prison to the <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelli,</hi>
otherwise called the <hi>Castle</hi> of
<hi>Abydos,</hi> being on the <hi>Europe</hi> side of

famous in <hi>Greek</hi> Poetrie. This remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of <hi>Sabatai</hi> from a worse Prison to
one of a better air; confirmed the <hi>Iews</hi>
with greater confidence of his being
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54134:45"/>
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> supposing that had it been
in the power of the <hi>Vizier,</hi> or other
Officers of the <hi>Turks,</hi> to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
his person, they would never
have permitted him to have lived to
that time, in regard their <hi>Maximes</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
them to quit all jealousies and
suspitions of ruine to their state by the
death of the party feared, which much
rather they ought to execute on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai,</hi>
who had not onely declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> but also pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
Prophesies fatal to the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> and his Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>With this consideration, and others
preceding, the <hi>Iews</hi> flock in great
numbers to the <hi>Castle,</hi> where he was
imprisoned, not onely from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
parts, but also from <hi>Poland,
Germanie, Legorne, Venice, Amsterdam,</hi>
and other places where the <hi>Iewt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side:
on all whom, as a reward of the
expence, and labours of their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<hi>Sabatai</hi> bestowed plenty of his
benedictions, promising encrease of
their store, and enlargement of their
Possessions in the <hi>Holy-Land.</hi> And so
great was the confluence of the <hi>Iews</hi>
to this place, that the <hi>Turks</hi> thought
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54134:45"/>
it requisite to make their advantage
thereof, and so not onely raised the
price of their Provision, Lodgings, and
other Necessaries, but also denied to
admit any to the presence of <hi>Sabatai,</hi>
unless for money, setting the price,
sometimes at five, sometimes at ten
<hi>Dollers,</hi> or more or less, according as
they guessed at their abilities, or zeal
of the person, by which gain and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the <hi>Turks</hi> no complaints
or advices were carried to <hi>Adrianople</hi>
either of the concourse of people, or
arguments amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> in that
place; but rather all civilities, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
indulged unto them, which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as a farther argument to ensnare
this poor people in the belief of their
<hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this time of confinement,
<hi>Sabatai</hi> had leisure to compose and
institute a new method of Worship for
the <hi>Iews,</hi> and principally the manner
of the celebration of the day of his
<hi>Nativity,</hi> which he prescribed in this
manner.</p>
            <p>BRethren, and my People, men of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>

you that the ninth day of the
Moneth of <hi>Ab</hi> (which according to our
account answered that year to the
Moneth of <hi>Iune</hi>) next to come, you
make a day of Invitation, and of great
Joy, celebrating it with choice meats
and pleasing drinks, with many Candles
and Lamps, with Musick and Songs,
because it is the day of the Birth of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai
Sevi,</hi> the high King above all
kings of the Earth. And as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of labour, and other things of like
nature, do, as becomes you, upon a day
of Festival, adorned with your finest
garments. As to your Prayers, let the

To converse with <hi>Christians</hi> on that
day is unlawful, though your Discourse
be of matters indifferent, all labour is
forbidden, but to sound instruments is
lawful. This shall be the method and
substance of your Prayers on this day
of Festival: After you have said, Blessed
be thou, O holy God! then proceed
and say, Thou hast chosen us before

all people, and hast loved us, and hast
been delighted with us, and hast hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
us more than all other Nations, and

us, O Lord God, according to thy love,
time of Joy, of Festivals, and times of

for a solemn Convocation of Holiness,
for the Birth of our King the <hi>Messiah,

And at the first Praises in the Morning,

and of the good and safety of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and observing in what a wilde
manner the whole People of the <hi>Iewes</hi>
was transported, with the groundless
beliefe of a <hi>Messiah,</hi> leaving not onely
their Trade, and course of living, but
publishing Prophesies of a speedy
Kingdome, of rescue from the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Turk,</hi> and leading the Grand
<hi>Signior</hi> himself Captive in Chaines;
matters so dangerous and obnoxious to
the State wherein they lived, as might
justly convict them of Treason and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and leave them to the Mercy of
that Justice, which on the least jealousie
and suspicion of Matters of this nature,
uses to extirpate Families, and subvert
the Mansion-houses of their own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
much rather of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> on whom

to dispoile them of their Estates, and

slavery. And indeed it would
have been a greater wonder then ever
<hi>Sabatai</hi> shewed, that the <hi>Turkes</hi> took
no advantage from all these extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances,
to dreine the <hi>Iewes</hi> of a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

that he had no hand in setting up

or known, before the coming of
the <hi>Messiah;</hi> for this superstition is so
far fixed amongst them, that generally
in their Families they spread a Table
for <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, to which they
make an Invitation of Poor people, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chief place for the Lord <hi>Elias,</hi>
whom they believe to be invisibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the entertainment, and there to
Eate, and Drink, without dimunition,
either of the Dishes, or of the Cup,
One person amongst the <hi>Iewes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Wife after a supper of this
kind, to leave the Cup filled with Wine,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54134:49"/>
and the Meat standing all night, for
<hi>Elias</hi> to Feast, and Rejoyce alone;
And in the morning arising early, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
that <hi>Elias</hi> took this Banquet so
kindly, that in token of gratitude, and
acceptance, he had replenish'd the Cup
with Oyle, in stead of Wine. It is a
certain Custome amongst the <hi>Iewes</hi> on
the Evening of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to repeate
certain Praises of God (called <hi>Havdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>)
which signifies a distinction, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the Sabbath from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
dayes (as they call them) which
Praises they observe to performe in this

the <hi>Turks</hi> made of their Prisoner at the

of all this Concourse of People, and

from their Obedience to the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior;</hi>
and taking likewise to his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi>
some certain discontented and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
<hi>Chochams,</hi> who being zealous
for their Nation, and jealous of the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequences
of this long-continued,
and increasing Madness, took liberty to
informe the <hi>Chimacham</hi> (who was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
of the Great <hi>Vizier</hi> then at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>)
that the <hi>Iew,</hi> Prisoner at the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi>
called <hi>Sabatai Sevi,</hi> was a Lewd
Person, and one who indeavoured to
debauch the mindes of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and
divert them from their honest course of
livelihood, and Obedience to the <hi>Grand
Signior;</hi> and that therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to clear the World of so Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
and dangerous a Spirit: The
<hi>Chimacham</hi> being thus informed, could
do no less then acquaint the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi>
with all the particulars of this
Mans Condition, Course of Life, and
Doctrine; which were no sooner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
but a <hi>Chiaux,</hi> or <hi>Messenger,</hi>
was immediately dispatched, to bring
up <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> to <hi>Adrianople.</hi> The
<hi>Chiaux</hi> executed his Commission after
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54134:53"/>
the <hi>Turkish</hi> fashion in hast, and brought
<hi>Sabatai</hi> in a few days to <hi>Adrianople,</hi>
without further excuse or ceremony;
not affording him an hours space to
take a solemn farewel of his Friends,
his Followers and Adorers; who now
were come to the vertical point of all
their hopes and expectations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> having by this
time received divers informations of
the madness of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of <hi>Sabatai;</hi> grew big with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and expectation to see him: so
that he no sooner arriv'd at <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
but the same hour he was brought
before the <hi>Grand Signior: Sabatai</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
much dejected, and failing of
that courage which he shewed in the
<hi>Synagogue;</hi> and being demanded seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Questions in <hi>Turkish</hi> by the <hi>Grand
Signior,</hi> he would not trust so farr to the
vertue of his <hi>Messiahship,</hi> as to deliver
himself in the <hi>Turkish Language;</hi> but
desired a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi> (who had
from a <hi>Iew</hi> turned <hi>Turk),</hi> to be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,
which was granted to him;
but not without reflection of the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by; that had he been the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
and <hi>son of God,</hi> as he formerly pretended,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54134:54"/>
his tongue would have flown with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie,
as well as with the perfection of
Languages. But the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
would not be put off without a <hi>Miracle,</hi>
and it must be one of his own choice:
which was, that <hi>Sabatai</hi> should be stript
naked, and set as a mark to his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Archers: if the Arrows passed
not his body, but that his flesh and
skin was proof like armour, then he
would believe him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
and the person whom God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to those Dominions, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etended. But now <hi>Sabatai</hi>
not having faith enough to stand to
so sharp a trial, renounced all his title
to Kingdoms and Governments, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that he was an ordinary
<hi>Chocham,</hi> and a poor <hi>Iew,</hi> as others were,
and had nothing of Priviledge, or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
above the rest. The <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
notwithstanding, not wholly satisfied
with this plain confession, declared, that
having given publique scandal to the
Professors of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> religion,
and done dishonour to his Soveraign
authoritie, by pretending to draw such
a considerable portion from him, as the
Land of <hi>Palestine;</hi> his treason and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54134:54"/>
crime was not to be expiated by any
other means then by a conversion to
the <hi>Mahometan</hi> faith, which if he refus'd
to do, the stake was ready at the gate
of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to empale him. <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai</hi>
being now reduced to extremitie of
his latter game; not being the least
doubtful what to do; for to die for
what he was assured was false, was
against nature, and the death of a mad
man: replyed with much chearfulness,
that he was contented to turn <hi>Turk,</hi>
and that it was not of force, but of
choice, having been a long time desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of so glorious a Profession, he
esteemed himself much honored, that
he had opportunity to own it; first in
the presence of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> And
here was the <hi>non plus ultra</hi> of all the
bluster and noise of this vain Impostor.
And now the <hi>Reader</hi> may be pleased
to pause a while, and contemplate the
strange point of consternation, shame,
and silence, to which the <hi>Iews</hi> were
reduc't, when they understood how
speedily their hopes were vanished, and
how poorly and ignominiously all their
fancies and promises of a new Kingdom,
their <hi>Pageantry,</hi> and Offices of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54134:55"/>
were past like a tale, or a midnights
dream: And all this was concluded,
and the <hi>Iews</hi> sunk on a sudden, and
fallen flat in their hopes, without so
much as a line of comfort, or excuse
from <hi>Sabatai;</hi> more than in general,
to all the brethren. That now they
should apply themselves to their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and services of God, as formerly,
for that matters relating unto him
were finished and the sentence past.
The news that <hi>Sabatai</hi> was turned
<hi>Turk,</hi> and the <hi>Messiah</hi> to a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi>
quickly filled all parts of <hi>Turky.</hi> The
<hi>Iews</hi> were strangely su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>prized at it, and
ashamed of their easie belief, of the
arguments with which they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
one the other, and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
they had made in their own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.
Abroad they became the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
derision of the Towns where
they inhabited: the Boys houted after
them, coyning a new word at <hi>Smyrna
(Ponftai)</hi> which every one seeing a
<hi>Iew,</hi> with a finger pointed out, would
pronounce with scorn and contempt:
so that this deceived people for a long
time after remained with confusion, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and dejection of spirit. And yet
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54134:55"/>
most of them affirm that <hi>Sabatai</hi> is not
turned <hi>Turk,</hi> but his shadow onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
on earth, and walks with a white
head, and in the habit of a <hi>Mahumetan:</hi>
but that his natural body and soul are
taken into heaven, there to reside until
the time appointed for accomplishment
of these wonders: and this opinion
began so commonly to take place, as
if this people resolved never to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived,
using the forms and rules for
Devotion prescribed them by their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan

               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:54134:58"/>
and <hi>Adrianople,</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> leaving their
Merchantlie course, and advices, what
prizes commodities bear and matters
of Traffique, stuffed their Letters for
<hi>Italy</hi> and other parts, with nothing but
wonders and miracles wrought by their
false <hi>Messiah.</hi> As then when the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> sent to take him, he caused all
the Messengers immediately to die, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which other <hi>Ianizaries</hi> being again
sent, they all fell dead with a word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

recall'd them to life; but of them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such who were true <hi>Turks,</hi> and not
those who had denied that faith in
which they were born, and had profest.
After this they added, that he went
voluntarily to prison, and though the
gates were barr'd and shut with strong
Locks of Iron, yet that <hi>Sabatai</hi> was
seen to walk through the streets with
a numerous attendance, and when
they laid Shackles on his neck and
feet, they not onely fell from him,
but were converted into Gold, with
which he gratified his true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
believers and disciples. Some Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54134:59"/>
also were reported of <hi>Nathan,</hi>
that onely at reading the name of
any particular man, or woman, he
would immediately recount the Story
of his, or her life, their sins or defaults,
and accordingly impose just correction
and penance for them. These strong
reports coming thus confidently into
<hi>Italy</hi> and all parts, the <hi>Iews</hi> of <hi>Casel

persons in behalf of their society, in

But that they might return

certain particulars of the Success of

that it was not he who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

God shall again see the season,

that an effect hereof they should

with which they should not onely
remain satisfied, but astonished. With
this onely hope of <hi>Nathan,</hi> these <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates</hi>
were a little comforted, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to attend his arrival, in regard
they had a Letter to consign into his
hands, and according to their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
were to demand of him the
grounds he had for his Prophesies,
and what assurance he had, that he
was divinely inspir'd, and how these
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54134:60"/>
things were reveal'd unto him, which
he had committed to Paper, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
to all parts of the World. At

on Friday the third of <hi>March,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Evening, and on <hi>Sunday</hi>
these <hi>Legates</hi> made their visit to
him: But <hi>Nathan,</hi> upon news of the
success of his beloved <hi>Messiah,</hi> began
to grow sullen and reserved; So
that the <hi>Legates</hi> could scarce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
admittance to him; all that
they could do was to inform him,
that they had a Letter to him from
the brother-hood of <hi>Italy,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to conferr with him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the foundation and authority he
had for his prophesies; but <hi>Nathan</hi>
refused to take the Letter, ordering
<hi>Kain Abolafio</hi> a <hi>Chocham</hi> of the City
of <hi>Smyrna</hi> to receive it; so that the
<hi>Legates</hi> returned ill contented, but
yet with hopes at <hi>Nathan</hi>'s arrival

that at this time we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Advice, that this man

there to Imbarke for <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and thence to go to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>

though it seem a strange thing
unto us, that any Man should
have a desire to throw himself
into a place of Flames, and Fire,

within the compass of your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
you give a stop to
his Journey, and not suffer
him to proceed farther, but
presently to return back. For
we would have you know, that
at his coming, he will again
begin to move those Tumults,
which have been caused through

they are, of which he will be
the first, whose Blood be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

or Fault is made Capital. You
may remember the Danger of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54134:62"/>
the first Combustion: And it is
very probable that he will be
an occasion of greater, which
the Tongue is not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press

by Vertue of Ours, and

to hinder him from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
farther in his Journey, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
paine of all those Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
which Our <hi>Law</hi>
can Impose, and to force him
to return back again, both he,
and his Company. But if he
shall in any manner Oppose

            <p>It happened, that amongst those

Practice. And it was not many years

the rest, and especially the

Clamor of it reached to the Eares

Intollerable, for even his own <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi>
began to be sensible of it, as

            <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> much terrified with the

               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:54134:68"/>At this <hi>Reply</hi> the <hi>Sophy</hi> appear'd to
be much Insenc'd: How! sayes he,
Do you not then believe <hi>Christ,</hi> of
whom our very <hi>Alcoran</hi> makes so Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable

            <p>After a long pause, and secret <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
with one another, it was at last
resolved among them, That though
they had deny'd <hi>Christ,</hi> they would

Therefore they told the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour;</hi>
That though their <hi>Religion</hi>
forbad them to believe any <hi>Prophet</hi>

<hi>Mahomet</hi> for a false <hi>Prophet,</hi> in as much
as he was descended of <hi>Ismael</hi> the
