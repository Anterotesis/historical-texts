            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <pb n="1" facs="tcp:94312:2"/>
            <head>The <hi>Queries</hi> of certaine tender-Conscienced Christians, concerning the late <hi>Protestation,</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them by the House of Commons, now Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the High and Honourable Court of Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they humbly crave a cleere satisfaction from their abler bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that they may take it with a well grounded and cheerfull Conscience.</head>
            <p>FIrst, as concerning the Authority of it, whether it comes sufficiently authorised to be imposed upon any, unlesse by the joynt consent of his sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and both Houses of that High and Honourable Court, both Head and Members? We do not hereby intend to charge any with the guilt of combination against Authority, but in the tendernesse of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, humbly to signifie our just scruples, about the authority imposing it, and the contents of it; if it be said it is not to be imposed on any, then we hope none can justly blame us, for using our lawfull liberty, and refusall of that which is not imposed on us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning the Necessity of it; what need is there of urging or taking Protestation at this time; since Oathes, sacred Bonds, are not to be taken without urgent necessity, unlesse wee will take the Name of God in Vaine: and though the prudence of the contrivers may see a necessity to commend it, yet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94312:3"/>
it is no wonder if such silly ones as we, see not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of taking it, untill they shall be pleased to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part their reasons. The conscientious will hold them selves bound to maintaine the Doctrine established, power of Parliaments, and liberty of Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: all others will slight it: we thinke in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity love a stronger bond then compulsion, and other meanes more effectuall for holding our of Popery, namely, diligent Preaching, Prayer, Humiliation, and Reformation, whereby we may encrease in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, and the ability to defend us against the enemies of it. But for Ministers it seemes lesse needfull, who have already subscribed and sworne, and subscribed to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> against Popery, against whom sufficient Provisoes are made in case they revolt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, what danger by multiplying Oathes, where divers for feare may be forced to take them, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctante conscientia.</hi> Most do make too little conscience of them, and may endanger the Land by drawing on it a judgement for their slighting such a sacred bond, or violation of it, <hi>For Oathes the Land mournes, Ier.</hi> 25.10. Whereupon Saint <hi>Austin</hi> in his second Sermon, <hi>De verbis Apostoli, Falsa juratio exitiosa, vera juratio pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculosa, nulla juratio secura est.</hi> Above all things my Brethren sweare not, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 5.12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, whether can this Oath betaken in faith? without which, whatsoever we doe is sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. Now this Oath comprehends so many things of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kinds, and divers of them unknowne to most of us, that though wee be ready to beleeve and receive some of them single, yet our faith cannot fathome all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94312:3"/>
together, and so we cannot sweare without doubting. And surely doubtfull swearing, is as dangerous as doubtfull eating: every Oath should be taken in truth, Righteousnesse and judgement. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.2. How can we take an Oath in Judgement, not having a full perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the meaning of it; or how can others with good Conscience presse it on us, till they give us full satisfaction herein?</p>
            <p>If it be answered that the Creed, &amp;c. are ambiguous, subject to doubtfull Interpretations, as appeares in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Articles, yet upon this reason, may not bee refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be sworne: to this, the learned Divines of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> have given sufficient answer. <hi>pag.</hi> 50. of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice: these are of Divine Authority, or next Divine, agreeable to the word, approved by the uniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all places in all ages. Whereupon wee are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly perswaded that the contrivers of them did neither intend, nor yet set downe any untruth, and therefore we doe submit to the infallible authority of them (though somethings be controverted in them) whereas we cannot suppose the same in any Oath contrived by men, subject to errors, wanting that generall appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>

         <div type="part">
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94312:4"/>
            <head>The Ambiguity of the OATH appeares to us in most, if not in all the severall Branches of it.</head>
            <p n="1">1. I <hi>Promise, Vow, and Protest, to maintaine with my Life, goods, and Power, the true Protestant Religion, expressed in the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>Quaere,</hi> What is the Doctrine of the Church of England? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that in the 39 Articles? Why is it not specified, that we may know to what we sweare? Whether may it not be extended to that which hereafter shall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished; since in the Oath it is not (<hi>not expressed, or already established</hi>) but, <hi>Expressed,</hi> in the Doctrine of the Church of England; which we suppose will bind us, if expressed hereafter; if so, None will set his seale to a blanke bond, so as the Obligee may make his debt as large as he listeth: and we conceave wee should bee more cautelous in engaging our selves by Oath, then our Estate by Bond, since the tye is more vigorous, and the breach more dangerous. <hi>Ley, pag.</hi> 55.</p>
            <p n="2">I <hi>swear to maintain this Doctrine against all Popery, and popish Innovations. Quaere,</hi> in what extent is Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry here abjur'd? Whether onely in Doctrinals, and such onely as are fundamentall, or come nigh the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation? or to remoter superstructions undetermined? Wherein it hath alwayes bin held lawfull for Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to vary, and <hi>abundare sensu suo.</hi> Whether to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline also? and hath not Episcopacy bin branded for a Popish Hierarchie, and the Ministers ordained
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94312:4"/>
by them and standing under them. Notwithstanding it hath beene allowed by our Doctrine and established by our law? Hath not our Liturgy (though establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by Act of Parliament) beene rejected as Popish? and all innocent Ceremonies (though ancienter far then Popery) if abused by them? Nay, one of late, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Popish Ceremonies tels us, that an oath must be extended to the largest sense, <hi>Disput. against Engl. Ceremonies, p.</hi> 93.97.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>I sweare to maintain the power and priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the lawfull liberty and rights of Subjects. Quaere,</hi> What are those priviledges of Parliaments and rights of Subjects? Are these evident by the light of nature, that upon notifying them, every one that sweares is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give his assent, acknowledging them undoubted priviledges and rights? or doe they vary in diverse Countries, according to the different constitutions of Statutes and charters depending on positive lawes? Why are we not directed to those lawes where we may be clearely informed, what are those undoubted privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and rights?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>I will maintain every person that maketh this Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in what he shall doe in the lawfull pursuance of the same. Quaer.</hi> Whither am I hereby bound to embroile my selfe in every private quarrell betwixt particular persons? Suppose one that hath taken this Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be oppressed by some great one and pursue his right. Whether am I hereby to engage my selfe? If it be with reference to the publicke State. Whether am I alone bound to maintaine him in his rights, or only joyntly with others? And how shall I be assured that it is his right, and that his pursuance is lawfull, that I may joyne with him?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94312:5"/>5 <hi>I will oppose and bring to condign punishment, all such as shall doe any thing to the contrary. Quaer.</hi> Whether is his sacred Majesty and his lawfull Successors here excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in case they should attempt some innovation in Religion, or to infringe the liberty of Parliaments, or the rights of Subjects, or to oppose any that hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this Protestation? Now to take up armes against our Soveraigne, either offensive or defensive, we have not as yet learned. We neither in the Scriptures nor the writings, nor practice of primitive times find any other remedy for Subjects unjustly prosecuted by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Monarches, but flight from their wrath, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient suffering, or humble supplication with teares and prayers. Nor dare we subscribe till we see those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments answered in the learned Duplice of the Divines of Aberdine, <hi>pag.</hi> 160. If his Majesty be excepted, why is it not expressed? Nor can the expression of such an exception be thought needlesse, though else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where we sweare to maintaine the King.</p>
            <p>Nor can it seeme a greater tendernesse of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Honour, to omit the exception in this clause, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing his Majesties constancy in Religion, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table disposition in the adminstration of Justice. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the modest request of such an exception cannot in the judgement of any reasonable man, import the slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest suspition of his Majesties inconstancy in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or disposition to injustice. None are more fully setled in their good opinion of him then wee. But wee provide for our owne peace, in case of dispute about the boundaries of Religion, priviledge of Parliaments, and rights of Subjects. Nor doe we cast the least asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of imprudence or disloyalty upon the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94312:5"/>
of this Protestation, which we doubt not but their wisedomes can easily cleare, and we much crave may be cleared to us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In case of dispute, what is the Religion established, power and priviledge of Parliaments, rights of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the lawfull meanes of the pursuance of the same, or concerning the boundaries of those; who shall be Judge? The dictate of every private mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science? That were to expose the Kingdome to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall contention; the Parliament? what if a dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise when no Parliament sits? The King and Counsel? or some deputed by his Majesty and the Parliament? or the stronger part?</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>I sweare never to relinquish this Protestation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Quaere,</hi> Doth this clause bind me for ever in no case to alter? What if the King and State should find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient hereafter to revoake this Protestation, or some thing in it? Why is not there a reservation of liberty to change with the State? Master <hi>Ley</hi> in his Booke of the late Canons, <hi>pag.</hi> 86. thinks it unfit to make <hi>Median</hi> &amp; <hi>Persian</hi> Protestantions, that cannot be altered, when as such changes may fall in a State, as the wisest law may be thought necessary to be altered, and therefore to receive no farther establishment, then may agree withall humane lawes to be left alterable.</p>
            <p>Nor let us be thought herein to wrong our selves, in forging exceptions and laying impediment sin our own way. We walke in sincerity according to our light, not forging to our selves, impediments or laying stumbling blockes in our owne way, but shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such as seeme to be layd in our way, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious expression of the Protestation. If any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94312:6"/>
thinke our doubts are too many, perchance he thinks too little of the peace of conscience of private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and price of Ministery.</p>
            <p>If any inforcement should be used, our suspence, till satisfaction be given, may be charitably ascribed rather to conscience then contumacy. And therefore the case so standing, we hope we shall neither be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the taking, nor our modest refusall oppressed with any penalty.</p>
            <p>What pitty were it which some mens feares begin to suggest, that after our painefull studies in the Universities, the expence of our patrimonies in our costly education (which might have maintained us plentifully in another course.) After our painefull imployments in our pastorall Church, to the tyring out of our strength. After our families encreased a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our abilities to support them (without the meanes we receive from the Church) to be thrust out of all, who cannot dig, and are ashamed to beg. After our hopes of removall of all burdens to be oppressed. With the same tongue that hath blest God for the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke zeale of that High and Honourable Court in removall of one Oath, now to complaine of the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our consciences by another? That when such care is taken for the establishment of the right of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (should this Oath come hereafter to be pressed) it might strip us of all, which we conceive derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our rights, who are not the worst Subjects. That those who have complained of subscription and oathes these eighty yeares (though of such things onely as were established by Parliament) should now be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to promote this, and presse it upon others.

When divers things established by law were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, the Church and State thought it expedient to interpreat them as appeares, by divers Canons, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brickes, and Injunctions, and the preface to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer. When the Oath of Supremacy was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construed, King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed Memory, vouchsafed to cleare it by publicke writings, and after to cleare this explication from all objections of <hi>Ball</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by Bishop <hi>Andrewes</hi> and others. When the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> had cleared the same Oath in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the King gave him thanks for his paines ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken therein, by a Letter now Printed. And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Parliament to remove the feare of some Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (as we heare) vouchsafed to set forth an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one clause of this Protestation.</p>
            <p>Whether would it not highly commend their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and eternize their goodnesse, to vouchsafe a further interpretation of all the severall branches of it, or authorize by speciall Commission, some grave, wise men, in every Diocesse, to admit of such interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as did not goe against the literall sense, and cleare it from all ambiguity.</p>
