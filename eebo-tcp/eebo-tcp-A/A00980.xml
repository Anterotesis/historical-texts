            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>tertainment, and strong opposition of the world.</p>
            <p>This cannot weigh with those stronger argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inciting mee to this dutie. I remember the <hi>Astronomers</hi> distinguish the visible fixt starres
<pb facs="tcp:2532:4"/>into six severall magnitudes; Those of the first and chiefest exceed the whole earth in quantitie an hundred and seven-fold, and even the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and cloudy of the sixt magnitude, eighteen-fold with advantage. Thus those first and great starres (the holy <hi>Apostles,</hi>) their followers and immediate Successours how wonderfully they did surmount the whole earth, may easily appeare in this; that when all the world interposed it selfe to ecclipse their light, yet did they then shine more bright, and filled the whole earth with the glorious splendour of the <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> So e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in these last ages, we haue knowne that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the opposition of <hi>Popes, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> and many other <hi>Princes</hi> (the whole earth indeed being banded against a very few, and farre inferiour to those fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st Ministers) yet did they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome all their malice, and shed the long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured light into all parts of the <hi>Christian</hi> world. For my selfe I rest assured, that one heavenly sparke in the least of those starres shining in the right hand of <hi>Christ</hi> shall not, nor cannot by any earthly opposition bee so ecclipsed, but that it shall breake through, and both enlighten, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame some of those whom <hi>God</hi> hath chosen.</p>
            <p>It may be some also will object, that other more learned, and every way more sufficient, haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready laboured in this Vineyard, and set forth their workes on this Psalme.</p>

            <head>¶ The Preface to every Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all Sciences whether liberall, or manuall, that Scholler makes the most happy progresse, whose Master doth first by instruction lay downe before him the grounds of his Art, and then farther opens them by practise, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. That guide will best conduct us, who not onely points out the way with his finger, but beats it with his foote, and cheerefully calls us after him.</p>
            <p>This happines our great, and onely <hi>Doctor</hi> affords us in his scriptures, who both propounds distinctly the mysteries of our faith in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and the rule of our manners in the law, and with all illustrats both in the plaine tracte, beaten by himselfe, and his faithfull members, whose footsteps of holy faith, and conversation, printed deepe before us, haue made the way much more easie for us that follow.</p>
            <p>It is no small light to us, when we see the combate between the <hi>Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it,</hi> and the flesh doctrinally expressed. <hi>Gal. 5. 17.</hi> But when we behold it acted personally in the Apostle (Rom. <hi>7.</hi>) and view him wrastling with that loathsome, and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome enemie, even the <hi>bodie of death,</hi> sometime taking, sometime giving the foyle, crying out for helpe, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into thankes for his victorie, it doth not onely cleare our understanding, but powerfully workes on our affections, shewes our enemie, and kindles us against him; first teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:2532:8"/>us, that fight we must; then instructs us how to fight how to overcome, and how to use the conquest.</p>
            <p>Therefore I dare boldly affirme, and every good <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> experience will confirme it, no portion of scripture yeelds more comfort to a soule struggling with sinne, and almost fainting under the burthen of corruption, then that duell there managed by the Apostle under the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And this is the reason why the booke of <hi>Psalmes</hi> is by all acknowledged the most profitable, and usefull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> because we here behold lively drawne, by <hi>Gods</hi> owne finger, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the face, and hands (the outward profession, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) but the very heart of that man, who was according to <hi>Gods</hi> owne heart: and so may take there a full view of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry limb, and be acquainted with every joynt, and feature of the new, and inward man: wee shall there see that heart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in action, continually drawing from that living fountain the word (to which it cleaues unseparably) the waters of life, and having throughly concocted them in the affection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning them againe to every part for growth and practice.</p>
            <p>Sometime we may perceiue him, as a Conquerour, with that stone which the builders refused, casting downe the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> which de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oft-times
<pb facs="tcp:2532:8"/>you may heare him, like the Larke, singing, and mounting in his song; his heart well tuned, and his tongue co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sorting with it, both full to the brinks, and overflowing with praise, and thanksgiving, yet often mourning like a dove, and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering like a swallow, his spirit drunke up, and sinking in the deepe waters, sticking fast in the mire, where no stay is: sometime faith even soring so high that it is sing'd with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, sometime plunged in the deep labouring for life, altogether benumbd, and almost frozen in despaire.</p>
            <p>In a word, the Booke of <hi>Psalmes</hi> is a field, where we may be most skilfully trained in all our <hi>Christian</hi> warfare: where this great Commander, famous for earthly, but far more renowned for heavenly victories, will breed us up in skill, and courage by his owne example: where, of the one side wee shall learne to know all our spirituall enemies, their colours, weapons, stratagems, their manner of charging; of the other side our Captain, succours, armours offensive, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, our discipline, conflict, victory, and triumph, and all these not onely by relation, but action in our fellow-souldier, and an old experienced Commander.</p>
            <p>This was the cause why having in the flock (over which the great <hi>Shepheard</hi> hath set me) for some yeers layed a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the more contemplative, and doctrinall parts of scripture; I after desired to build on this ground, and lead them on to the practicall, here to learne of this holy <hi>Psalmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this little brooke this net hath not wholy beene in vaine; which hath perswaded me to let it downe into the sea; I haue not fished for vaine glory, or applause of men, nor used such trammels, as may enclose any such game.

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Lessednesse</hi> is that greatest good of man, which all desire and seeke for it selfe, and all other things for it: that Haven of rest, to which man driues with all his sailes, and oares, and there vnfraughts all his thoughts and actions; sits downe, and so acquieteth his soule, Where it is situate, and how to shape our course to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, no Card or Compasse, but onely <hi>Gods Word</hi> can
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2532:11"/>direct vs. They which saile thither without this Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle (doe but obserue them) after with their guide they haue compassed Sea and Land, finish their voyage in the dead Sea. Most men, and almost all that travaile this way, are wasted by such <hi>Pilots,</hi> that it is no maruaile to see them so widely or wildely to erre and wander.</p>
            <p>The Covetous man sets <hi>Mammon</hi> at the sterne, and makes no doubt, but to arriue safely there with such a guide The Ambitious chuseth <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades himselfe to attaine it by his direction. The Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous takes along <hi>Beliall</hi> with him, (that dissolute and vnthriftie companion) and feares not, while he holds the rudder, to touch at this Land of Happinesse. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry best, and wisest not onely of the Heathen, but worldly Professours resting themselues vpon Morality, and Forme, haue seemed to themselues and others a long time to make a good voyage, but all at length split at one rocke, and meete in the gulfe of destruction.</p>
            <p>Some few embarking themselues in that sure, but despised Vessell of <hi>Gods word,</hi> and vtterly reiecting all other <hi>Pilots,</hi> giving vp themselues vnto the direction of the blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> haue, not indeed without many stormes, yet safely landed their soules in that blessed Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and possessed the inheritance of rest and promise.<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 31.</note> Hence it is that the <hi>Wisedome of God whose delights are with the children of men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 36.</note> seeing <hi>such multitudes scattered, and wandring as sheepe without a shepheard, hath compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on them,</hi> and aswell by his owne, as by this his King of Heralds voyce, and by his Sonne (the wisest type of Wisedome) calls to these wandring wretches:<note place="margin">Prov. 9.6.</note> 
               <hi>Forsake your way yee foolish, and you shall liue, and walke in the way of vnderstanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now of this Psalme, (where our happy estate is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently described, and the way to it plainely poynted out to vs) it is fit to consider aswell the Authour as the matter. The Authour is either principall, or subordinate, our head <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who by his <hi>Spirit</hi> indited it, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2532:11"/>the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> whom he vsed as his Secretary, or hand to write it. The scope, as of all other Scripture, is to be <hi>a lampe vnto our feete, and a light vnto our paths,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.105</note> and as the very finger of <hi>God,</hi> to point out the new, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, but intising way to misery, and the old, and safe way, which leads to happinesse. The method or order is this. First our Guide shewes us a farre off, a generall &amp; confused view of blessednes; the end of all our travell: then points out the left-hand way, which to an unwary eye seemes faire, and likely, and warnes us to take heed of it; which more perfectly he describes, by the severall periods of it. These are three. 1. <hi>walking in the counsell of the ungodly</hi>; 2. <hi>standing in the way of sinners</hi>; 3. <hi>sitting in the seate of the scornefull</hi>:</p>
            <p>All this in the first verse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he sets out the true way to happines, which seemes the farthest about, but is the neerest home<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and our severall journies in it, which are but two: first <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting</hi>; secondly, <hi>meditating in Gods word,</hi> which is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified from the time, <hi>day and night</hi>: And this is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the second verse.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the next place he more distinctly and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally discovers this happinesse, that so he may winne us to it; First, by a most familiar and elegant similitude of a tree: 1. <hi>planted:</hi> 2. <hi>watered:</hi> 3. <hi>fruitfull</hi>: 4. <hi>flourishing:</hi> then by a part of it namely, <hi>prosperity.</hi> This in the 3 verse.</p>
            <p>Fourthly h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> displayes the woefull estate of those who goe the other way; first negatiuely, <hi>They are not so: not blessed, not planted, not watered, not fruitfull, not flourishing, they prosper not.</hi> Againe affirmatiuely, by a comparison: <hi>they are as chaffe blowne away with the wind</hi>; and therefore shall be separated from the wheat, and burnt with fire. This is deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in the 4 and 5 v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rses.</p>
            <p>Lastly in the sixt, he giues an infallible reason of all he speakes, namely, the providence of <hi>God</hi> over-looking, and disposing both.</p>
            <p>Now as a Guide, who undertakes onely to bring us
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2532:12"/>in the right way to our journies end, in our passage will beguile the way with some discourse, or name to us the Townes, Castles, Rivers, &amp;c. by which we passe. So this holy <hi>Saint</hi> leading us forward, entertaines the way with much profitable matter: pointing out though obscurely old <hi>Babilon,</hi> and new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the false, and true Church with their lawes and manners. Having thus prepared the way, let us now enter upon it, and in the first wee'l obserue the Guide himselfe; from whom we gather this proposition.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <note place="margin">Proposition.</note>
               <hi>The Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and in him, the holy Ghost is the Author of this Psalme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we may profit the more by this Teacher, let us consider how he is qualified for this office: wise Princes, if they cannot make men fit for any place, will chuse such as are already made to their hand. But the <hi>Lords</hi> election prepares, and enables his servants for any calling in his Church. Let us then behold him either in his spirituall or temporall estate. First <hi>God</hi> tooke him (the youngest of many brethren) from following the sheepe, and made him a Shepheard of men; King over his onely people, the house of <hi>Israell</hi>; and so filled his heart with wisedome, valour, and other gifts necessary for government, that never any Prince joyntly in them all, was more, or indeed equally renowned. He blessed his raigne with many famous victories;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 9.</note> 
               <hi>was with him wheresoever he went, cut off all his enemies, and made him a great name, like the name of the great men which are on the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, his spirituall estate may be considered either in his publike office,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 8.14</note> as he was a <hi>Prophet, a man of God,</hi> none more famous among the <hi>Prophets:</hi> or in his private disposition,<note place="margin">Acts 13, 22.</note> 
               <hi>a man after Gods owne heart,</hi> propounded as a patterne, especially to Princes; whence it is that all his successours are either condemned for not following him, or commended for treading in his footsteps.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:2532:12"/>For confirmation of this Proposition,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Proofe.</hi>
               </note> it is evident that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is the prime Author of the Booke of <hi>Psalmes: For all Scripture is inspired, and holy men spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> Moreover our Saviour reckons the Psalmes with <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 20. 21.</note> &amp; the Prophets as holy Scripture:<note place="margin">Luke 24. 44. 45. Luk. 20.42.</note> and <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Christ</hi> is entituled to this Booke: and the Scripture giues evident witnesse of the <hi>Spirit</hi> speaking by him;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.1,2</note> 
               <hi>The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and his word was in my tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will not be vnprofitable to lay downe some reasons or grounds of this action,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grounds.</hi>
               </note> aswell in <hi>God</hi> the principall, as in <hi>David</hi> the subordinate Author. The cause then why <hi>God</hi> writes, and writes in this kinde, by <hi>songs,</hi> and why he employes <hi>David,</hi> as his hand, are either in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in vs, or in this holy Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t. In himselfe his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious will and wisedome;<note place="margin">Luke 10. 21.</note> 
               <hi>He reveales and conceales these things, because it so pleaseth him.</hi> See also <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 13. 17. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8. In vs whom he teacheth, there are some occasions, as 1. our difficulty in learning, especially things spirituall. 2. our naturall delight in <hi>Musicke.</hi> 3. A certaine aptnesse in numbers to convey to our mindes, and settle in our memories these profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blelessons. The reasons why he vseth <hi>David</hi> in this imployment, may be 1. the gift of <hi>Musicke,</hi> in which he excelled. 2. the sanctifying gifts of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> which afforded ditties to his notes, and by expressing his holy affections, filled others, on all o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>casions, to lay open, and poure out their hearts to <hi>God</hi> in prayer. In <hi>Dauid</hi> the cause of writing may be 1. his Faith:<note place="margin">Psal. 116. 10.</note> 
               <hi>I beleeved ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I spake.</hi> 2. his loue, desiring to draw others on to that happinesse, which himselfe had found. Ioyne these together, and we shall find a good ground of this action. We are vnapt to learne, there is an aptnesse in this kind of teaching to sinke easier, and deeper into our mindes: <hi>God</hi> knowes in his wisedome what is best for vs, and his loue will effect it; therefore having-fitted <hi>David</hi> with this qualitie of holy <hi>Musicke,</hi> he stirres vp his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2532:13"/>heart to vtter by faith, what he had learned, and by loue to draw on our lagging affections to the like gracious practise.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ause the Word of <hi>God</hi> whether written, or preached, is given for our vse and profit, for <hi>teaching, confuting, trying, comforting, and exhorting,</hi> that by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it partly to our vnderstanding, we might grow in light, and be better informed in our judgement, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to our will and affections, we might be reformed, let vs see what vse we may make of this point, and first for our instruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Instruction.</hi> 1. Learne then here, that man is of an indocible nature, especially in things spirituall, hard to conceive, prone to forget; why else should <hi>God</hi> himselfe vndertake this Office? Why should he employ so many Writers? so many Speakers? furnish them with all mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of learning, great variety of gifts, singular, and divers vtterance? Had we a good capacity to conceive the lessons of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> were we of firme memory, to retaine what we had rightly conceived, all this labour had bin in vaine, and needlesse.</p>
            <p>No surely, our vnderstandings are over-whelmed with a thicke mist, an <hi>AEgyptian</hi> palpable darkenesse, not easily dispelled by this glorious light; well may the beames of <hi>Gods word</hi> shine round about vs,<note place="margin">Zach. 7.12.</note> but vntill the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> shine in our hearts, and opens a window for it, not one sparke of light can enter.

How justly doth our Master complaine of vs?<note place="margin">Esay 28.9. 10.11.</note>

Let us first cleere some of the words, that wee may goe on with more profit. <hi>Sinners</hi>; Certaine is it that all men are sinners, if we take the word in the largest sense:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.23. Rom. 5.12.</note> 
                     <hi>For all men haue sinned, and are deprived of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God: sinne,</hi> and <hi>death</hi> the attendant of sinne <hi>have gone over all men</hi>: in which sense the most righteous man on earth may be called a sinner. But this word is often vsed in Scripture by specialtie, for notorious sinners,<note place="margin">Esay 57.20.</note> such, who sweltring &amp; boyling in sinfull lusts,<note place="margin">Iude 13.</note> fome out their own shame, in an open scumme of all filthinesse.

                           <desc>•</desc>

                     </note> was accounted a sinner:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 18.</note> that is, one knowne, and commonly noted to goe on in grosse sinnes. Thus the <hi>Amalekits</hi> are called <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Such then are here called <hi>sinners,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 21.25</note> who liue in open &amp; notorious sinnes: as <hi>Achab</hi> who <hi>sold himselfe to worke wickednesse: who accustomed to sinne, follow it with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 19.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 To <hi>stand,</hi> is such a position of the body, wherein it begins to settle it selfe to some rest: and therefore by a metaphor ordinarily in Scripture is taken for such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of minde, whereby resisting all opposition, or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2532:33"/>perswasion to the contrary, we resolue to maintaine the course we haue begun.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.13.</note> Thus is it taken in the good sense: <hi>Stand in the faith</hi>;<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.11. 13.14.</note> wher to stand is so to harden our selues in continuance of our holy profession, that we resolue to die, rather then to be removed by any tentation and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault of the enemie.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the <hi>way</hi> argues also a perseverance, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in any course; That is, a way where no stoppage is, but a path continually trodden, and beaten by the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger. Now evill wayes may be considered either in doctrine, (so heresie is called an evill way) or in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and conversation; so an habituall or customarie sin is an evill way. In all these words is expressed a further degree of sinne. A <hi>sinner</hi> in this sense is more then an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man, the <hi>way</hi> more then <hi>counsell, standing</hi> more then <hi>walking.</hi> And every one of these words imply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, perseverance, and stubbornesse in evill. This then is the meaning of the words: <hi>Whosoever doth not rest in sinne, nor stubbornly persist in the rebellious course of notorious offenders, him the Prophet pronounceth blessed.</hi> No proofe shall need; the proposition being sufficiently evidenced in it selfe, and every converted sinner a strong witnesse for it. The grounds or reasons may bee first in <hi>God,</hi> his infinite grace, which opens a posterne vnto his favour, for those that unfainedly returne unto him, and forsake their evill wayes, hee covers <note n="*" place="margin">See Ier. 3.1. 12,13,14.</note> all their past re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, and imputeth not sinne unto them.

He had walked in some counsels of the ungodly,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 59.</note> but yet <hi>considering his wayes, and turning his feete into the testimonies of his Lord</hi>; he found mercy and favour.

                     <hi>blessed is the man whose wickednesse is forgiven, to whom the Lord imputeth no sinne.</hi> Secondly, being assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by an infallible and inward experience,<note place="margin">Psa. 32.5.7</note> that <hi>when we hide not our iniquitie,</hi> but acknowledge and confesse <hi>our

The sence then of this proposition is. <hi>Although thou hast sorted thy selfe with worldlings, and hast beene misled in their vngodly courses, although after many reproofs, thou hast neglected the grace which was offered; and hast now long continued in thy folly, even despising in thy carnall conceit the wisedome of God in his word, yet if thou now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnest, leanest not still to thine owne wit, but yeeldest vp thy selfe to the yoke of Christ, thou art heere already, and shalt be must more heereafter happy, and blessed.</hi>

As therefore the <hi>Creatour</hi> framed one great originall light, to rule the day, so that by the beames of it the creature might haue power to discerne all things necessarie to be seene: so to this end he calleth the Scripture <hi>light,</hi> because he hath given it a lightsome qualitie, whereby it discovers unto us whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is necessary to eternall life; and it might direct and instruct us in every good way and worke: for surely words are to the eare the same, that light is to the eye; the eye by light discerneth things visible, and distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth every creature which it seeth: so the word of man opens his intention to us, which else lieth hidden in his heart; and is altogether imperceptible.</p>
               <p>Thus the word of <hi>God</hi> doth manifest unto us the will and purpose of <hi>God,</hi> and cleerely reveales to all and every one, what is necessary for them to know; as being all plaine <hi>to them that will understand.</hi>

But because even the faithfull them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues did not at the first thus know them: therefore they examined their preaching by the touch-stone of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> was a singular <hi>Apostle</hi> in doctrine, and miracles, &amp;c. yet did not the faithfull take his word at adventure, but tryed it by the Scripture, and then gaue credit to it. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11.

See here the happy or blessed man delighteth in the law of <hi>God</hi>: as well the word it selfe, as the way set him downe in that word is pleasant and delightfull. Obserue therefore the worke &amp; wisedome of our <hi>Creator,</hi> and thou shalt find that as he hath allotted to the creatures severall beings and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; so hath he filled every nature with severall affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; dispositions. Among the sensible some take their pastime in the ayre, some in the water, nay some within the earth. In the vegetatiue we see some trees, and herbs delight and thriue in waterie and marish grounds, other in dry and rockie; some in hot, and others in cold; some in a fat, others in a barren soile. Thus in the food and nourishment of sensible bodies what a strange difference doe we see? That is pleasant and wholsome to one which to another is loathsome and a deadly poyson. Thus hath that <hi>all-wise Creatour</hi> disposed, that there shall be a kind of aptnesse, and affection in one creature to sustaine and beare up the nature of another. Now as he hath given to the creatures severall natures, and fitted them with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nourishments answearable to their constitutions; so also hath he so tempered their complexions, that they are necessarily, and strongly carried by their appetite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire those things, whereby their nature is sustained and comforted: applying their tast to delight in those nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishments. Thus in thy bodily life he hath given bread and wine for thy sustenance, and so ordained, that by his blessing there is in this food a power of increasing, and strengthning the body, and in the body a necessary and earnest desire of these aliments, and in the tast a pleasure to receiue them. Thus now is it with thy soule. If thou art entred into this new life;<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is that bread which came downe from heaven, the bread and water of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2532:59"/>life, the true vine, which cheeres up thy soule: hee is brought home to thee in his word, which word <hi>God</hi> hath purposely given to be the meanes of spirituall life, and hath put into it his power to salvation: therefore as he hath given to the spirituall man an unseparable appetite to hunger and thirst after it; so likewise hath he given a spirituall tast, to which this <hi>good and wholesome word</hi> is <hi>as hony and the hony combe,</hi> so that they are not a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and pleased with it. If therefore thou canst finde in thee this spirituall tast, constantly delighting in the word; it is a sure note of life.</p>
               <p>But had not <hi>Herod,</hi> and haue not temporary beleevers a tast, yea a delighting tast in the word? Yes: but 1. not constantly; no not in the promise. 3. The delight which they haue, is not indeed in the word, but in their owne conceits falsly drawne from it: as remission of sinnes at all adventure; mercy and grace without any true change or repentance, and such like; yea even then many things of <hi>Gods</hi> law they spit out as bitter and unsavory. But the true Beleever hath this tast in him constantly, though sometimes dulled by tentation; and rejoyceth not onely in those sweet promises which nourish him, but even in those bitter reproofes; as in sowre, but wholesome sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, provoking to appetite, and clensing the stomacke. So likewise all the wayes of heauenly wisedome pointed out to him are wayes of pleasure. The way of godlinesse, righteousnesse, sobrietie are all delightfull. This is not so with the wicked man, who may please himselfe (or at least seeme so) in some of these: but hath no heart to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny necessary duties, nay utterly d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2532:60"/>nay even despising the rule of <hi>God,</hi> at least precisenesse of that rule. The hypocrite will gild over his out-side with a faire resemblance of pietie to <hi>God,</hi> and the eye must be very sharpe to spie out a fault in the outward forme of his profession, but is far from that seeming care of righteousnesse, and just dealing with men, but that we may easily discerne grosse neglect of such duties. But he that delighteth in the Law of <hi>God</hi> cannot be thus dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. But as he loues the <hi>Lord</hi> for himselfe, and delights his soule in rendring to <hi>God</hi> that which is his: so doth he loue his brother for <hi>God,</hi> and will carefully obserue his respects unto him.</p>

So likewise the most proper object of the eare is sound, the most excellent object of the eare is the voice of man, and words expressing their notions: but that which infinitely excells it, is the word of <hi>God,</hi> and his voice, unfolding his gracious purpose towards us, and therefore aboue all other to be most attended &amp; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Verily there is nothing that settles and rootes the word in the heart of man but this practise.

               </p>
               <p>In the former three things must be unfolded. 1. what kind of <hi>tree</hi> is here intended. 2. in what respect the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are compared to a <hi>tree planted.</hi> 3. what it is which answers to the <hi>rivers of water</hi> in this similitude.</p>
               <p>For the first; The kind is set downe (in generall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) a <hi>tree</hi>; but by all probabilitie the <hi>Palme-tree</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intended. This may appeare 1. by some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from this place: 1. because (as <hi>Plinie</hi> affirmes) the <hi>Palme</hi> delights in running waters; and desires continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to drinke; 2. because the fruit of the <hi>Palme</hi> is ever in waxing: some budding, while others are growing, and while these grow, others ripen: so that they are three yeares before they come to any perfection. Lastly the leafe of the <hi>Palme</hi> withers not, but continues greene, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in winter. 2.

               <p>For the second, in what regard the faithfull are thus compared, is very plaine. <hi>Trees</hi> are planted, either by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholy removed from one place to another, or when a sience is cut off from one stocke, and grafted into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>Now this darkenesse intends. 1. A grosse ignorance of <hi>God,</hi> and of his will, which is the cause of all miserie.

               <p>But to passe by very many similitudes, none is more frequent then this of grafting: And as grafting is double, either by implanting a base sience into a noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous stocke, or letting a good and pleasant sience into a base and sower stocke: so in this spirituall planting, we shall find sometime the stocke to be <hi>Christ,</hi> (<hi>the true vine, and naturall Olive</hi>) sometime our cursed nature is compared to the body of tree, and the word of <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to the graft, as <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 21. so then as a wild o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue grafted into a true, is partaker of the sap, and fruit of the good Oliue, and is utterly changed, and becomes of another nature and tast; so when we are grafted into <hi>Christ,</hi> wee receiue all spirituall influence from him, whereby ws are fruitfull: for without him we can do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus meditation in the word teacheth us the feare of the <hi>Lord Deut.</hi> 17. 19. and 31. 12. 13. So to loue the <hi>Lord</hi> is the maine lesson, which is continually pressed upon us by the word, and which enters with it where it is effectually received: see <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 10. so <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word.</hi>

                     <hi>Whosoever with delight meditates in Gods word, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hee doth shall prosper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there is no word which needeth explication but this of <hi>prosperitie.</hi> And <hi>prosperitie</hi> is nothing else, but that successe in our ends which we desire, and by hope expect: when therfore we purpose any action to some good end, and wee see our affaires sort to that end, or better then we hoped, then this action is said to prosper. But obserue that in prosperitie either in the whole estate of man, or in any one particular action, is required not onely the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining some one (the immediate or middle) end, unlesse we reach to the principall and supreme. As for instance; Suppose a man sowes much, that he may reape and enjoy abundance of fruits, he desires abundance that he may rest and be merry: if now he attaines his hopes in receiving plenty, and obtaines not this rest and joy, hee cannot be said to prosper in this action. Thus that rich mans super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie prospered not with him <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 19.20. The <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But if we misse of the immediate, and attaine the supreme end, our actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper: for he that faileth of plentie, but is filled with rest and joy, prospers in his purpose. <hi>Prosperitie</hi> therefore may be considered either absolutely in the generall, and whole estate of man, or in particular when we enjoy our hopes in some or many ends, which we desire and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our selues.</p>
                  <p>The sense then of this proposition is; <hi>Whosoever delights and meditates in the word of God, whatsoever hee setteth his hand unto shall surely haue successe, in working for him that which hee desireth and hopeth, at least in the maine and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, if not in the lesse and particular ends.</hi>

The whole <hi>chap: Deut.</hi> 28. is spent in this subject. But what need we travaile to forraine Nations for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to this truth, when our owne Land even in our time, is a strong confirmation of it?

                  <p>Sense, reason, and experience will confirme this. For first it is apparant to sense, that as a tree drawes no juice from any soile but that onely in which it is rooted, nor a twig can haue other sap, then that which it receiues from the roote, to which it is united: so worldly wicked men, being still rooted and defixed in the world, and being not united to <hi>Christ</hi> by faith, nor transplanted into the house of <hi>God,</hi> can haue no other affections or actions then are in the wicked world: they cannot haue that life which springs from <hi>Christ</hi> alone. Againe even reason will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it. For when through the intercession of some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Favourite, satisfaction is received, and pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to all, who renowncing their rebellion, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe their armes, come in, acknowledge their fault, submit themselues, and giue their oath of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; those haue no benefit of this pardon who performe not these conditions, but continue in their treason: thus our reason will assure us; that the faithfull, and they only, turning from sinne, and subjecting themselues to the word, haue benefit from the death, life, and intercession of <hi>Christ.</hi> And will not our experience also testifie it? For what fruit hath he of <hi>Christs</hi> death, whom wee see
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2532:105"/>liue to sinne? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 2. 7. 8. what benefit of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, who hath no life of the <hi>Spirit</hi>? what good by his intercession, which are condemned with the world? see <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 17.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 2 Againe in that a wicked man is not as a tree plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the rivers of water, nourished by that moisture of life in the word, learne here, that the word of <hi>God</hi> doth not profit the vnfaithfull, and wilfull sinners, such as go on in their sin. They may hear, know, and vnderstand what is spoken, be able to discourse of it, and dispute by it, but it brings home no life to them, no saving grace.<note place="margin">Heb. 4.2.</note> 
                     <hi>The word doth not profite them because it is not mixed with faith.</hi> Looke as in earthly treasure, we may see great summes, heare the ring of it, see it told out, know the worth, and quantitie of it, nay hold it in our hands, and carry it to others, yet be no whit the richer by it, unles we own it our selves, and purse it vp to our owne use: so in the riches of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> wicked persons may hear, read, discern the particulars, and excellencie of it, convey it to others, and be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues poore, and naked. Men may fit at table, see much varietie of meate, smell it, know the sweetnes of it, tast the goodnesse of it, but if they doe not swallow, reteyne, and digest it, it profits nothing. Thus many sit as the people of <hi>God,</hi> have some savour, and smacke of some grace, tast the good word, but casting it out againe, and not incorporating it into their soules by an unfained faith, &amp; through obedience, it doth them no good. So in that parable, where the <hi>Lord</hi> compareth the word to seede,<note place="margin">Luke 8.</note> the wicked are resembled to such grounds, as are either stony, and resist it; or haunted with ravenous fowles which devoure it, or over-runne with thornes and briars which choake it.

                  <p>The reasons of this are manifest. 1. There is no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for the word to enter into the hearts of wicked men; an hard fore-skinne stops up the doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is a deadly feod and open warre betwixt the word and the wicked. It will not spare them, nor they it; it is a word to wound, a mighty weapon to subdue them, accuses, reproches, vexes them; they abuse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and slander it: hence the Minister is of all other most hated and opposed by them, reviled, and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously abused and abased. Compare <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 10. with 18. 18. Nay the word is so farre from bringing them life, that it hurts and kills not of it selfe, but through their default;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>They pervert it to their owne destruction.</hi> For as good meate breedes good nourishment in a good, but noisome humours in an ill stomacke; so the word is the savour of life to the Elect, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, as when wholesome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is brought into a filthy pit, the stinking slime infects it with a noysome and poysoning qualitie: so when that pure and precious word, the water of life, enters into a wicked and rebellious eare, it proues deadly, (and as <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke</hi> that never worketh) the destruction of him, who taking it into his understanding resists it, and suffers it not to worke upon the will and affections: see <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 11. The raine which falleth from heaven, and watereth the earth, bringeth out both good seed and weed with it, so
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2532:106"/>the word doth not onely nourish good things, that are planted in us, but accidentally through the perversnes of men (sometimes their mis-construing, sometimes their opposition, lusting against it) produceth their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, and consequently worketh their perdition.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Reasons further to assure this point, are many and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident. For 1. These graces doe not, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y cannot spring from nature, but are planted by <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> and called his fruits <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. Now not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of rebellion worketh in the disobedient, that <hi>Prince of the ayre Ephe.</hi> 2. 2. And certainely as the sower first with the plough cuts up the weedes by the roote, before he casteth in any good seed into the land; so this great <hi>Husband man</hi> mortifies in us these earthly members, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he creates the new man: he therefore that continues still in his wickednesse, cannot haue this fruit of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, True saving grace as it is planted, so is it nourished by the word of <hi>God</hi>; It is a right hearing of the word, and receiving it with obedience, which makes us fruitfull:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. 5. 6. <hi>Faith comes by hearing. The word sanctifies, Ioh.</hi> 17. 17. and indeed is the very seed of those fruits <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 11. Now then, as since the curse which the <hi>Lord</hi> layed on the earth we find by experience, that our grounds without tillage and seed bring forth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit but weedes, and nettles, briars, thornes, and thistles: so even reason will teach us, that since the curse hath devoured our Fathers, we cannot without this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall tillage and seed of <hi>Gods</hi> word be fruitfull in this harvest: for <hi>God</hi> hath appointed seed for every fruit, and although he can, yet will not worke without it, where he giues it: now we know that wicked persons haue no loue to this truth, hate it, reject it, and will not yeelde their strength unto it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The heart of a wicked man so farre forth as it is wicked, is incapeable of these fruits of holin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sse; for
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2532:110"/>whereas all these graces consist in subjection and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to the law of <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>flesh</hi> cannot bee subject to this <hi>Law, Rom.</hi> 8.7. It is with our barren nature as with some hungry soiles, they must be mended, nay new moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before they can be fruitfull; that salt of the Sanctuarie must be cast into us, (as into the waters of <hi>Iericho</hi>) before we can be healed. Looke as that water received into the suspected wife, if shee were defiled, entered into her bowels and rotted her, if innocent, hurt her not, but made her fruitfull. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 27. 28. so this water which we drinke in the house of <hi>God,</hi> when wee receiue it into a polluted soule, workes to our destruction: but when we (cleered by our high Priest and by him justified) receiue it with a pure affection, it fills us with the blessed fruit of all holinesse.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Wheresoever is this spirituall life of holines it washes and clenses, it will not suffer any sinfull wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse to dwell peaceably in the heart, much lesse beare rule or haue dominion there.<note place="margin">Gal 5.17.</note> 
                     <hi>The Spirit lusteth against the flesh. The strong man is cast out by the stronger,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 11. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>and his goods spoiled.</hi> They therefore who liue in rebellion, under the dominion of sinne, where wickednesse keepes quiet pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session (as it is in all ungodly persons) cannot possibly haue any fruit of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> For as where health and life by receit of some good <hi>Physicke</hi> begin to grow more strong, there nature wrastling with the disease workes to cast out the sicke humour; so when the death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Christ</hi> are effectually ministred unto us, this life of <hi>God</hi> being planted in us, struggles against this death of sinne, and will not cease till it haue expelled this hellish infection.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, wickednesse is that qualitie which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary and irreconcileably adverse to these fruits of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and therefore wheresoever predominant, keepeth out and driues away that by which it selfe is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2532:111"/>the kingdome of <hi>God</hi> cannot bee setled in the heart so long as sinne and Satan haue the scepter. But, as when <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robam</hi> had usurped the Kingdome over the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For opening the words, consider what is this <hi>chaffe,</hi> and what is the resemblance betweene the <hi>chaffe</hi> and the <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> and also what answers in this comparison to the <hi>winde.</hi>

                        </gap>omes</hi> (as we may call them) or motes of the chaffe, which are altogether unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which we fan out and cast away.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But what is the resemblance betweene them?</p>
                  <p>Not to be curious. 1. The <hi>chaffe</hi> groweth up in the same field, and is brought home into the same barne with the <hi>wheat:</hi> so wicked hypocrites are in the same visible Church, and are mingled in the Congregation of the <hi>Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>chaffe</hi> and <hi>wheat</hi> are both beaten with the same flaile, and the <hi>wheat</hi> purged by it, but the <hi>chaffe</hi> turned into dust and filth: so the wicked and saithfull are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the same gracious word, and rods; and the <hi>Saints</hi> are indeed refined, and clensed by it, the wicked grow worse and worse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This <hi>chaffe</hi>-dust is profitable no way, noysome many wayes; it hurts our eyes, spreads our garments with filth: thus there is no good to be reaped from wicked persons, but much hurt: they will hinder us in our light, they will draw us to defile our garments.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Every Husbandman will separate in his time the <hi>chaffe</hi> from the <hi>wheat</hi>: so will <hi>Christ</hi> make a separation betweene the Goats and the sheepe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Lastly, in that separation the <hi>chaffe</hi> is destroyed and consumed; so in that day of the <hi>Lord</hi> the <hi>wicked shall bee burned with unquenchable fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>winde</hi> in this similitude is compared to the judgements of <hi>God,</hi> either in this, or in the other life: in this, afflictions and troubles without and within; in the other, their finall condemnation.</p>
                  <p>So that the sense is; <hi>Howsoever wicked men are in the Church, partakers of the same ordinances of God, yet receiue they no profit by them, but become altogether unprofitable &amp; noysome, therefore God will in his time separate them, &amp; cast

                  <p>Secondly; The <hi>Congregation</hi> signifieth here a certaine Assembly or societie of men gathered together, and so intends nothing else but the Church. Now the Church is diversly taken: sometime for the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> that is, the whole bodie of <hi>Christ,</hi> comprising in it all the faithfull, from the first to the last member of his mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bodie living in the world.

The <hi>militant Church</hi> hath many subdivisions, and is either visible in severall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, professing openly the name of <hi>Christ</hi>; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, which are the faithfull in those Congregations, confessing also in heart the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> and his truth: who although (as men) are visible, and may bee discerned by any bodily eye, yet as the faithfull, and truely sanctified, cannot ordinarily or generally be distinguished from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hypocrites living with them in the same assemblies. So likewise the visible Church hath many branches: some greater as of a whole Province, so we distinguish the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine, East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> Churches; some lesser, as the Church confined to any one Citie; the <hi>Churth of Rome,</hi> the <hi>Church of Corinth</hi>; and some private, shut up in one familie, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>Philem.</hi> 2. There is also a distinction of a true Church, which continues in all
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2532:130"/>fundamentall truth delivered by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi>; or false, which declines to some hereticall doctrines, and departs from the foundation, either from that rule of faith or manners: Thus as the <hi>Marcionits, Arrians, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians, &amp;c.</hi> erring in matter of faith concerning the <hi>Godhead</hi> or <hi>manhood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> or concerning the blessed <hi>Spirit.</hi> So the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> maintaining filthy and promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous lusts, were false Churches, howsoever they were sound in divers other points of <hi>Christian</hi> doctrine.

                  <p>In the former words the <hi>Prophet</hi> giues an infallible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the faithfull shall prosper in their wayes, and bee blessed: here also he useth a necessary argument, why the ungodly cannot haue good successe, nor ever attaine to happinesse. Now how soever he leaues out the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> or opposite axiom to the former, <hi>God knowes not the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2532:141"/>way of ungodly men</hi>; yet is it here without question to be understood. I will therefore handle it fully, and annexe the cause with the effect in this intire proposition.</p>

                     <hi>God knowes not the way of the ungodly, therefore they &amp; their wayes shall perish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words haue beene before sufficiently cleered: as well who are the ungodly, what also is ment by their wayes is evident enough; their thoughts, counsels, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, nay also their outward dignitie, glory, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, &amp;c. So likewise what this knowledge is may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily discerned, namely, the <hi>Lord</hi> indeed knowes to take notice of them for their confusion, but to approue or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect them knoweth them not. Lastly, that is said to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, which attaines not the end to which it is aymed, but comes to nothing.</p>
                  <p>The meaning is; <hi>The Lord also sees all the devises and plots of wicked persons rejects, despises, and hates them, and their wayes, therefore they shall certainely bee destroyed and consumed.</hi>

Now the ungodly are evill in their persons, states, actions; <hi>There is no good in them, Rom.</hi> 7. 18. but a continuall course of evill, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5.
