         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ESTATE
Of the POOR in
SION COLLEGE
LONDON,
TRULY STATED,
BY
GEORGE DAGGET Attorney, and Clerk of the ſaid College.
In a Letter to a Friend.</head>
            <head type="sub">With Licenſe, <date>May 5. 1688.</date>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FOR preventing further Miſtakes, and
ſaving my ſelf daily trouble in giving
Account to ſuch as come or ſend to
me for ſatisfaction, how the Poor of
<hi>Sion-College</hi> are maintained, and for
Vindication of the Reverend, the Governours
of the ſaid College, choſen Annually by the
whole <hi>London</hi> Clergy, according to their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who are unjuſtly reflected upon in this
Weeks <hi>Publick Occurrences,</hi> I have here ſent you
a brief, but faithful Account how that matter
ſtands, from the Regiſter in my Cuſtody, having
been Clerk of the ſaid College, for theſe thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years laſt paſt, and reſided for the moſt part
in the Lodgings appointed me by the Founders
Will.</p>
            <p>Now by the Books it appears, that according
to the ſaid Will, the Alms-people are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to the Governours for the time being,
by the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the Merchant-Taylors
Company, and the Pariſhes of St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s in
the Weſt, and St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s, <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when the College, of two preſented,
have choſen one, the reſpective Preſenters
give the College Security by Bonds, not only to
maintain and relieve them in Sickneſs and other
Exigencies, but alſo in caſe of Death, to ſee
them decently buried. And I am able to atteſt
of my own Knowledg, that the ſaid Preſenters,
eſpecially the two Pariſhes, do viſit and relieve
them upon notice given; and the Alms-people
are ready to acknowledg their kindneſs, except
two or three of the Alms-men, that live idly,
and ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end their ſmall Allowance, chiefly in Drink,
to the ſcandal of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>I find that but two Women were buried from
hence laſt year, one of St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s in the Weſt,
the other a Merchant-Taylor's Widow of St.
<hi>Giles's Cripplegate</hi> Pariſh, both which were taken
care of during their Sickneſs, and buried by the
Church-wardens of the ſaid Pariſhes, as they,
and the Nurſes of the Deceaſed, are ready to
atteſt.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Ill Management or Miſimployment</hi>
alledged in the <hi>Weekly Occurrences;</hi> It is well
known, that the whole College and Alms-houſes
were burnt down, and quite deſtroyed by the
Dreadful Fire, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1666. and that in three
or four years enſuing, the Clergy of <hi>London,</hi> by
their own Subſcriptions, and the Charitable
Contributions of others, Rebuilt the Library,
and the Alms-houſes under it for ten Men, and
ten Women, in decent and diſtinct Apartments,
which coſt together 1300<hi>l.</hi> and upwards; this
was the firſt Care of the Governours, after the
Fire, and the Alms-people ſleep in the Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
built by the <hi>London</hi> Clergy.</p>
            <p>And as for their <hi>Penſions, being now but</hi>
               <hi>3l. 10s. per Annum, whereas the Founder
left 6l. to each Perſon;</hi> it is fit the World
ſhould know, That the Lands appropriated to
the Alms-Houſes, lye in the Hundreds of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
and were in the beginning of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt's Reign, Reported and ſetled by Judg
<hi>Crook</hi> and others, to be ſuch as would hold
120<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and by Order in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi>
were Demiſed to Mr. <hi>Keeling,</hi> one of
the Executors of Dr. <hi>White,</hi> for 200 years, at
120<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> for the Alms-Houſes,
without Impeachment of Waſt; That about
ten years ſince, the Right of the Leaſe came to
a young Woman, a Deſcendant of the ſaid
<hi>Keeling,</hi> and was in the Cuſtody of Mr. <hi>Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
a Merchant now in <hi>London;</hi> which W<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:98582:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Loſſes in her Eſtate (as Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> proved)
became ſo poor, as to be maintained by Charity,
and ſo all benefit of the Covenant in the Leaſe
was loſt; and hereupon By reaſon of Rents
falling, Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> and his Tenant left the
Lands and Houſes without notice, and very
much out of Repair, ſo that the Governours
of the College then ſent to the Aldermen of
<hi>Briſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l,</hi> the Company of <hi>Merchant-Taylors,</hi> and
the Church-Wardens of the aforeſaid Pariſhes;
and ſome of each appointed by the ſaid Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Company, and Pariſhes, met at the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
and at <hi>Merchant-Taylors</hi> Hall ſeveral
times, and viewing the Title, with Counſel,
ſent down Agents to view the Lands, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
for getting a Tenant; who, after a years
ſeeking, could not get a good Tenant, at more
than 70<hi>l. per Annum;</hi> and it was thus Leaſed
for 21 years from that time, with Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
for the Tenant to lay out about 200<hi>l.</hi>
in Repairs, the Farm not being Tenantable
without it; and this was one reaſon more why
the Rent was ſunk ſo low; and it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when this Leaſe expires, it will hardly yield
70<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> by reaſon of great Damages
through Sluces and Salt-water.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, that the Poor of <hi>Briſtol</hi> are not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by Lands in the Hundred of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> but
<hi>Briſtol</hi> will tell you, that the Lands there given
them by Dr. <hi>White,</hi> were ſet apart by his Will, for
repairing a Cauſe-way leading to the City, and
they alſo are ſo ſunk in value, that the City is
forced to pay out of their Chamber, large Sums
<hi>per Annum,</hi> to make up the defects of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>I know alſo, that of late years, the <hi>London</hi>
Clergy, by their own repeated Subſcriptions,
and ſome Contributions, have built the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege-Hall,
and ſeveral Tenements near it, moſt
of which are now let to Students and others;
for which they have expended near two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds more, and contracted a great Debt,
which they are endeavouring to pay by the ſame
means.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, that the Founder left 40<hi>l. per Ann.</hi>
for four Latin Sermons, and four Dinners every
year; but ſince the Fire the Preachers Fee is loſt,
and the Dinners (which were diſcontinued for
ſome years for want of a Hall) are now reduced
to two in a year, and thoſe (ſaving only three
years) were all paid for by Contributions of the
Clergy at the Baſon, the overplus only being
paid by the College.</p>
            <p>I do not find much above 20<hi>l. per Annum</hi> in
Ground-rents about the College; (other Rents
there are, but newly built, and not yet paid
for); out of which, by the King's Quit-rent,
Rent-charge to St. <hi>Alfage</hi> Pariſh, Pariſh Taxes
and Duties, Library-keepers Salaries, Porters
and Meſſengers Wages, River-water for the
Alms-people, repairs in Tiling Glazing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the whole is expended, and as much
more.</p>
            <p>And now my Hand is in, give me leave to
add, That whereas the Clerk's Salary was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fire 20<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> with the uſe of
the Hall, and fair Lodgings: I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with 5<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and three Little
Rooms, for the building of which, in part, I my
ſelf laid out 50<hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as to the</hi> 30 l. per Annum, <hi>mentioned in
the</hi> Occurrences, Lately left the College by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor,
of which (<hi>ſays the Writer</hi>) they have had
no Benefit. <hi>The Caſe is thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Brewer</hi> late of the <hi>Temple,</hi> left by Will, a
Farm in <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> to the Poor of <hi>Sion-College,</hi>
which was Leaſed by himſelf for twelve years,
expiring laſt <hi>Lady-day,</hi> for 27<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and
that he dying in <hi>March</hi> 1684. the College hath
been in Suits, both at <hi>Common-Law,</hi> and <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi>
ever ſince, with the Heir and Executors
claiming this Eſtate by Entails alledged; and
that in <hi>February</hi> laſt, the Cauſe in <hi>Chancery</hi>
came to a Hearing, where one of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
appeared by <hi>three or four,</hi> and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
as Plaintiff, by <hi>three Eminent Counſels,</hi>
and they obtained a Decretal Order againſt that
Defendant, for the Land; but the other Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
to make more work, did not appear. The
Charges of theſe Suits are near <hi>70l.</hi> paid, and
to be paid out of the Arrears; and the College
have already made a Dividend to the Poor,
amounting to more than the over-plus in their
Hands.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Mr. <hi>Brewer</hi> left alſo his Library to
<hi>Sion College,</hi> which is ſtill detained by the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
alledging that they have not Aſſits ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to pay the Teſtators Debts; by which you
may obſerve, That the College takes care in
the firſt place of the <hi>Poor's Right,</hi> and I have
good Aſſurance that they intend to do ſo, tho it
be to their own Damage.</p>
            <p>And this, Sir, I hope, is enough to ſatisfie you
and all others. I only wiſh, That this Paper
may be made as publick as the <hi>Occurrences.</hi>
