            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS I cannot expect
thy Thanks, so I
need not fear thy Censure
for the Publication of
these Meditations. For by
<pb facs="tcp:96725:3"/>
the forwardness of the
Book-seller to promote
thine (I hope) as well as
his own profit, they passed
the Press altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my knowledg; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I received the least In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
of any such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
they were by him
presented to me intirely
Printed, desiring my atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of their Legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
To prevent therefore
thy doubt and suspicion
<pb facs="tcp:96725:3"/>
touching their true Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
I do from good and
manifold Evidence assure
thee, they are the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
though early off-spring
of that Reverend Person
whose name is prefixed to
them. In his Lordships
life-time I have often
heard him mention, not
only in general this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate,
as one of his <hi>First
Theological Essays;</hi> But
likewise in particular, his
<pb facs="tcp:96725:4"/>
Presenting
thereof to
a Pious
and Charitable<note n="*" place="margin">Mrs. Nixon of Oxon.</note> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
who by an holy
emulation of her name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<hi>Joanna</hi> in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist,
did minister
unto Christ of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
by liberal Gifts to
his Preachers and Poor.
From this Copy fairly
written with the Authors
own hand, and prefaced
<pb facs="tcp:96725:4"/>
with a short paper of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to that his Friend,
were they Printed by the
Stationer. And since the
Decease of my Father,
and his only
Brother<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. John Reynolds Rector of Blaby.</note>
(both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of two Months),
two Copies of the same
came into my Possession;
amongst each of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
one: Both the fruit
<pb facs="tcp:96725:5"/>
as of the Heart and
Head, so of the Hand
too of the Author, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
agreeing together, as
I found upon perusal of
them; and (as far as
my Memory can assist
me, absent from my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in comparing them)
fully according with this
Third, now made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>The first Lisping sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes
of young Children,
<pb facs="tcp:96725:5"/>
and the last Gasping Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells
of dying friends, of
all words, are wont to
make most deep and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impressions upon us.
That these short Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
some of the first Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile
Breathings in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of that devout Soul
now with God, may obtain
like effect, is the prayer of</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:96725:6"/>
            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THis Reverend Author,
of great renown for
Piety and Learning,
needs no Letters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:
For as it was
said of righteous <hi>Abel, That
he being dead, yet speaketh,
Heb.</hi> 11. 5. so this profound
and pious Divine yet lives,
and speaks in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Works; wherein he
hath studied (as the Apostle
<pb facs="tcp:96725:7"/>
gave in charge to <hi>Timothy)
to approve himself a workman
that needeth not to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
rightly dividing the
word of truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 15.
Yet because many eminent
Writers not only after they
were dead, but even whilst
they were alive, have been
much abus'd and injur'd by
surreptitious, or suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
at least by imperfect
Copies of their Works;
therefore I thought my self
obliged (as being an ancient
and intimate acquaintance
of the worthy Author) to
give this Testimony to the
<pb facs="tcp:96725:7"/>
Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
<hi>Meditations concerning
Saint Peters Fall and Rising,</hi>
are the genuine issue of the
Head-labours, and Heart-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of the Author, whose
name they bear, and whose
stile they resemble as face in
water answers face,
<q>
                  <l>—Sic oculos, sic ille ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
sic ora ferebat.</l>
               </q>
Neither do they only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
his stile (which is
much of an evidence to be
his) but they are printed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own <hi>Original
Manuscript.</hi> These <hi>Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
were pen'd and sent (as
<pb facs="tcp:96725:8"/>
a New-years Gift) to one
of his ancient Friends in
<hi>Oxford,</hi> much about that
time, when he wrote those
two Learned Treatises,
One <hi>of the Passions and
Faculties of the Soul of
Man.</hi> The other, <hi>of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he was Fellow
of <hi>Merton</hi>-Colledg, <hi>Oxon,</hi>
his pregnant Gifts and
Graces shined forth even
in his younger years. How
well he hath improv'd his
time not only in his elder
years, but in his younger
<pb facs="tcp:96725:8"/>
also, his Learned Labours
declare, publisht for the
great benefit of the Church
of God. This consideration
deserves such a special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
of Honour to be fixt
upon him, as to perpetuate
his blessed memory to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
and to remain for
the living as a signal pattern
worthy of imitation.</p>
            <p>It's observable, that in his
preaching and writing (as
the Wiseman chargeth)
<hi>Whatsoever his hands found
to do, he did it with all his
might,</hi> Eccles. 9. 10. He was
such a Preacher as the same
<pb facs="tcp:96725:9"/>
Wiseman mentions, <hi>The
Preacher sought to find out
acceptable words, and that
which was written was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
even words
of truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verba desiderii, Verba rectitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, Verba veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis.</note> Eccles.
12. 10. <hi>David</hi>
said to <hi>Araunah,</hi>
when he would have given
him freely Oxen for Burnt-Sacrifice,
<hi>I will surely buy
it of thee at a price, neither
will I offer Burnt-offerings
unto the Lord my God which
doth cost me nothing,</hi> 2 Sam.
24. 24. It's abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that this eminent
Preacher and Writer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
<pb facs="tcp:96725:9"/>
much pains and
studies in whatever he
Preacht or Printed. His
Works smell of the Lamp,
and of indefatigable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.
I shall add no more
concerning the Author, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I cannot say enough
of his deserts: And the
sayings are vulgar, <hi>Nemo
vituperat Herculem. Expede
Herculem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Subject of these
Meditations is <hi>Peter's Fall
and Rising.</hi> One thing is
added in Saint <hi>Mark,</hi>
which is not mention'd in
the other three Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists:
<pb facs="tcp:96725:10"/>
For it's said, <hi>And
when he thought thereon,
he wept.</hi> If we peruse the
Original word, we shall
find that he cast something
over his head (as Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Delinquents us'd
to do when they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
to be
seen),<note place="margin">Mark 14. 72. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Theouph.</note> and so
<hi>Theophylact</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
the
place. <hi>Peter</hi>
denied shamefully, and
therefore he wept bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Great Sins will cost
even God's dearest Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
great and bitter sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.
<pb facs="tcp:96725:10"/>
We might add more
Instances of <hi>David, Mary
Magdalen, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. But
this instance of <hi>Peter</hi> is a
sufficient evidence.</p>
            <p>It's a saying of <hi>Justin
Martyr, That it's best of all
not to sin: and next, to amend
upon the punishment.</hi> But
who of any understanding
would therefore break his
head, because he hopes to
have a good Medicine to
cure it? The Uses which we
ought to make of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of <hi>Peter,</hi> are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
by Saint <hi>Paul, Thou
standest by Faith, be not</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96725:11"/>
high minded, but fear, <hi>Rom
10.</hi> 20. Wherefore let him
that thinketh he standeth,
take heed lest he fall, 1 <hi>Cor.
10. 12. What St.</hi> Austine
<hi>said of</hi> David, <hi>may be
well applied particularly
unto our selves,</hi> Let such
<hi>(saith he)</hi> who
have not fallen,<note place="margin">Audiant qui non ceciderunt ne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, qui ceciderunt ut surgant. Non ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi exemplum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponitur, sed si ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris, resurgendi, <hi>August. in Psalm</hi> 51.</note>
hear, and take
heed of falling:
such as have
fallen, let them
hear and rise
again. Here is not propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
an example of falling,
but an example of rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb facs="tcp:96725:11"/>
after falling.</p>
            <p>This Treatise (though
short) is pithy and solid,
and contains the quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of good invention,
and sound judgment,
(which are the two parts
of Logick.) It may be
compar'd to an <hi>Illiad</hi> in a
Nutshell, or to a Map
describing in a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of paper, a large
Country, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in a few significant
words; and the Motto
may be—
<q>
                  <l>Pondere non numero.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96725:12"/>
The same Renowned
Author hath preacht many
Excellent and Elaborate
Sermons upon that Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Prophecy of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah.</hi>
And likewise he hath
preacht many profound
Sermons upon several Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Conscience: Both
which he hath unfolded
with great dexterity of
judgment; many whereof
I my self (with others far
better able to judg) have
heard him preach (about
twenty and six years since)
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> both to admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96725:12"/>
It's much to be desir'd
and hoped that it may be
obtain'd for the publick
good, that the Reverend
and Learned Doctor his
only surviving Son, who
doth <hi>Patrissare,</hi> (to whom

The first man, <hi>Adam,</hi> the

of a weak Confidence, the

into a depth of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.

               <p>WHat can we expect
from <hi>Peter</hi> but a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
denial of his Masters
person amongst his enemies,
who dares even to his own
face make a double denial
of his Truth? He that will
adventure to deny the truth
of Christs Word, will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon temptation deny the
profession of his Truth. <hi>You
all</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>shall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
because of me this
night. Nay, Lord,</hi> answers
Peter, <hi>though all, yet never
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96725:17"/>
I. Yes,</hi> Peter, <hi>thou more than
any: for this very night thou
shalt thrice deny me.</hi> O no
Lord, I know mine own
strength, I am so confident
of my love unto thee, that
neither life nor death can
separate me from it. I have
a sword in my hand, and I
have a sword in my mouth;
my Blade and my Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shall both follow thee
unto death. <hi>Peter</hi> hath not
yet learn'd, not to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
his Master, though once
he got nothing but a <hi>Satan</hi>
for it. It is not one either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
or disgrace, can root
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96725:17"/>
up the untowardness of a
corrupt disposition. Weak
man! seest thou not how
thou hast already begun to
deny thy Lord? and even
then hast enter'd upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt,
when thou seemest most
fortified and constant in thy
resolution? That man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
him, who denies his
Word, he being no longer
Christ than he is true. Why
then shouldest thou either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
thy Masters word,
which told thee, <hi>that all
should be offended?</hi> or else
have any such confident pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of thine own
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96725:18"/>
strength, or uncharitable
conceit of thy fellows weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as to believe his predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
touching their falling,
and yet think he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in thee, who art pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
and confident of
thine own standing? That
God which out of true weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hath ordained strength,
doth here out of presumed
strength foretel weakness;
and as he can make the
mouths of babes and suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to confess him, so can
he suffer the mouth of an
Apostle, a <hi>Peter,</hi> to deny
him. Shewing in both the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96725:18"/>
dependance as well of strong
as of weak on his Goodness:
The strongest Apostle being
not able without his sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-grace
to confess him;
and with it, the weakest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
in the street being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to cry <hi>Hosanna</hi> unto

               <head>MED. III.</head>
               <p>I Cannot be so uncharitable
as not to believe, That it
was <hi>Peters</hi> Faith and Love
which made unto Christ this
promise of perseverance in
his profession: such fruit and
sweetness had he found in
those words of eternal life,
such power in that Son
of the living God, that he
could not but think it bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
to follow and enjoy
his society even unto death,
who was able to sweeten and
sanctifie death it self. But
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96725:19"/>
behold, in the same soul, nay
in the same action, a mixture,
I had almost said a predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
of faith and flesh! The
desire and the purpose come
from faith, the confidence
and resolution came from
flesh. Self-dependance, pride,
or any other carnal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is more deeply
rooted in the particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of any man, do often
intermix themselves in his
most holy actions. It was
faith that made <hi>Peter</hi> go
down upon the Water, but it
was flesh that made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to sink: Faith made him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96725:20"/>
zealous in Christs Cause, but
flesh drew hls sword at <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
his ear: Faith made
him follow Christ, but flesh
made him follow afar off:
Faith made him accompany
Christ to the garden, but flesh
made him sleep when he
should have sorrowed: Faith
made him promise perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but flesh made him
peremptory in that promise:
in a word, Faith made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
to confess, but flesh
to contradict his Master.
Vows and Promises uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally
addressed, cannot
but prove dangerous to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96725:20"/>
strongest Faith. God must
first give us perseverance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we can promise it; It is
not in our power, though it
be our duty to perform it.
Though <hi>Peter</hi> may in the
vertue of Christs promise be
sure not to fall into Hell, he
cannot in the vertue of his
own promise be sure not to
fall into temptation; though
he can be secure that Faith
shall have the last victory;
yet he cannot that it shall
have every victory: though
it cannot die and be finally
dried up, yet it may ebb, and
languish; and though even
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96725:21"/>
now it can look undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the nails of a Cross, yet
presently it may be affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the voice of a Maid.
He only that hath given
faith unto us, can give life
and action unto our faith.
Christ is both the quickner,
and the object of our Faith,
by whose power it worketh,
and on whose merits it rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
When He therefore is
pleas'd to remove and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
himself, Faith must
needs be there unoperative,
where both its Object and its
Mover is absent. As we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see the Sun but by the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96725:21"/>
light of the Sun, so neither
can we believe in Christ but
by the Grace of Christ. Who
can wonder that the outward
parts of the body should be
benum'd and stupid, when
the spirits and animal vertues
which should enliven them,
have retir'd themselves? Lord!
let me never barely promise,
but let me withal pray unto
thee; and let ever my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to die for thee, be secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with a supplication that
I may not deny thee; when
ever I have an arm of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to lift up in defence of
thy Truth, let me have a knee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96725:22"/>
of humility to bow down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy Throne: Lord, give
me what I may promise, and
I will promise what thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirest.</p>

taught from the

not with the same holy faith

of Christ so far as concern'd
their weakness, and yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
it in the presumption of
his own strength? What
though he be the chief in
following his Master, may
he not as well be the chief
in falling from him? I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

knew a priority of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
priviledg'd with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence
of Grace. Yet such
is the nature of Greatness,
that it conceits it self secure
from danger, and apprehends
spiritual immunity in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
honour. How errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is the frailty of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!
How ready to trust
upon an arm of flesh, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
free-will, supremacy,
even against divine predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of danger, and thinks it
self sufficiently arm'd with
that, than which there is no

               <p>ONE would have thought
that <hi>Peter</hi> upon the
noise of a denial, should have
begun to tremble, and not to
boast; to arm, and not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume;
to suspect his strength,
and not promise it: But that
a double warning should
find a double presumption,
would make a man confident
to expect an invincible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution;
and believe that
even naked and empty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
being so deeply enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
would have, if not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96725:24"/>
yet shame enough to
persist in such a purpose,
which being broken, could
not but infer the discredit
not only of a weak, but of
an inconstant spirit; more
faithless in the execution of
a promise, more impotent in
its contempt of death, than
could well stand with the
honestly or courage of a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
But it is the justice of
God to give over nature to
faintings and falls, when it
relyes upon it self; and to
make him fear the least as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
who hath not arm'd
himself with that which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96725:24"/>
should defend him against
the greatest. One tear or
sigh, though emblems of
weakness, could more have
prevailed to strengthen <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Faith, than so many
fruitless boasts, the gildings
and flourishings of a rotten
confidence. A little Peble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
will overturn and sink
down a <hi>Goliah,</hi> when all
the Armor of <hi>Saul</hi> will rather
cumber than profit in such a
conflict.</p>

               <p>GReat Promises require
great cares; and he who
hath deeply engag'd himself
in any service, must needs be
either very vigilant, or very
faithless. How is it then that
after so many promises I find
<hi>Peter</hi> sleeping even then
when his Master is sweating?
and that that Garden should
be the bed of so secure a
rest, which was the Theater
of so exquisite and unimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an anguish? Can he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Christ a whole night to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96725:25"/>
his Judgment, that cannot
watch one hour for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort?
can he command his
life to be laid down for
Christs Truth, that cannot
command his eyes to be the
witnesses of his sorrow? so
long as we are out of the
view of danger, we can make
large promises of our
strength to bear it; but when
once it draws near, and
creeps upon us, we begin to
look with another colour
both on it and our selves,
and become either desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fearful, or supinely stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid.
Like untoward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful

               <p>I Cannot wonder that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
should fall off, being
tempted, who is already,
though unquestion'd, so far
behind; that he should trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the terror of Death,
who cannot endure the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a Watch. He must
learn more to deny himself,
before he can take up his
Cross. The nights of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
Martyr, must be spent
in the studies of patience, not
in security and ease; he must
first be a persecutor of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96725:27"/>
and exercise a holy cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
on his own flesh, by
cruncifying the lusts thereof,
before he can be able to
overcome the wit, and most
exquisite inventions of his
tormentors, in a holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
patience. The Soul
must be first rais'd unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
before the body can be
willing to go down into the
earth. Had <hi>Peter</hi> watch'd
and accompanied his Master,
he might have receiv'd fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
encouragement in his
resolution to die for him, and
learn'd from the extremity
of his anguish, if not to hate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96725:27"/>
life, which could make a man
subject to such expressless
sorrow; yet at least willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to embrace the present
opportunity of glorifying
God by a constant death;
even for this respect, that
thereby he might be freed
from the capacity and danger
of those afflictions, which he
should there have seen flesh
and blood lyable unto. Of
how many precious occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of good does the too
great love of our flesh and
ease deprive us? Every man
would love God more, if he
could be more out of love
with himself.</p>

               <p>I Cannot expect other, but
that he should follow
Christ afar off, who goes
sleepily after him; nor can
I hope for courage from his
tongue, whose feet begin
so soon to play the Cowards.
It is not likely that he will
come near Christ in <hi>Golgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi>
that follows him afar
off in the Judgment-hall:
if he be unwilling to seem
his, he will be quickly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to deny him. Behold the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96725:28"/>
beginnings of <hi>Peter</hi>'s backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in his very following
of Christ! To follow him
indeed is a work of Faith;
but to follow afar off, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but by little and
little to go back from him.
See how the preparations
unto <hi>Peter</hi>'s fall second each
other. After sleeping, he
follows afar off; and from
that, he comes to sitting still;
and that not in private to
pray or repent, but in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
to warm himself at that
fire, where his Conscience,
though not seared, was yet
made more hard. He which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96725:29"/>
prefers the heat of a fire,
compassed in with the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
of wicked men
(the nearest pattern that
can be of Hell) to the sweet
society of his Saviour, with
the discommodity of a cold
air, and an ensuing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cannot be far from
denying of him. That man
whom the enjoying of any
temporal benefit, or the
opportunity of any sensual
and worldly delight, can
induce to forsake the
company of Christ, (who
is ever present in his
Ordinances) is at the next
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96725:29"/>
door (if occasion were
given) to Apostacy and
backsliding.</p>

               <p>THE Devil hath a kind
of method and colour
of modesty in his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
He knew that it
would not sort with the
Holiness of <hi>Peter,</hi> to shoot
at the first a fiery dart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and tempt him
in the very beginning of his
onset, unto a perjur'd and
blasphemous denial of his
Master. <hi>Peter</hi> would have
at the first trembled at so
fearful a suggestion. And
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96725:30"/>
therefore, like a cunning
Captain, he so ranks and
musters up his forces, as that
the first Temptation shall
like weaker Soldiers make
way for the latter, which
are the old experienced and
sturdy fighters; the former
serve only to weaken <hi>Peter,</hi>
the latter to overthrow him.
At the first the Devil
tempts us to small sins, to
remit something of our won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vigor, to indulge a little
unto our corrupt desires, to
unbend our thoughts, and
to slacken our pace in prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of good courses, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96725:31"/>
by cooling our selves we may
be able to hold out the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but when he hath
drawn us thus far, he hath
gotten the advantage of us;
and having a door open, lets
in his more ugly and horrid
Temptations. Sin hath its
several ages and growths;
first, it is but conceiv'd and
shap'd in the womb of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence;
then it is nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and given suck by the
embraces and delights of
the Will, as of a Nurse;
then lastly, it grows into a
strong man, and doth of it
self run up and down our
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96725:31"/>
little World, invade all the
faculties of Soul and Body,
which are at last made the
instruments of Satan to act
and fulfill it. Satan at the
first leads us downward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Hell, as it were, by
steps and stairs, which
though they go lower and
lower, yet we seem still to
have firm footing, and to be
able to go back at pleasure.
But at last we find, as the
way more and more slippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
so the enemy ready at
hand to push us down into
a dungeon of unrecoverable
misery, did not Gods mercy
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96725:32"/>
pluck us as a brand out of
the fire. <hi>Peter</hi> first sleeps
only, that seemed the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of his nature; then he

was pretended to be only
the drowsiness of his sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
then he sits down at

the coldness of the air: But
then comes denying, swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
cursing; and had not
Christ in time looked back
upon him, the next step
and regress, would have
reach'd unto the jaws of
Hell. But it was the great
Wisdom and Mercy of Christ
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96725:32"/>
to honour the estate of his
ignominy and reproach, his
death and judgment, with
two of his greatest Miracles,
The assuming of a repentant
Thief, and the re-assuming
of a revolted Disciple.</p>

               <p>IT is no wonder if <hi>Peter</hi>
be tempted to forsake his
Master, when he is far off
from him. How can he chuse
but stumble and fall, who
hideth himself from the Sun
of Righteousness, who is
absent from the Light of the
World, who wanders out of
the way of Life, who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the voice of that word
of Truth which only succor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
directeth, leadeth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth
in Holiness and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96725:33"/>
Security? He which testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Faith by following,
and yet lays open his flesh
and weakness by following
afar off, shall be sure to
meet with such an enemy as
hates our Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
takes advantage by our
weakness to oppose it. Our
Faith provokes him to enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for he is adversary to
none so much as those that
are out of his power; and
our weakness invites him to
an assault, for he trembles
and flies from opposition.
Had <hi>Peter</hi> abode in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of his Lord, Satan
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96725:34"/>
would not have dar'd to
tempt him unto a Triple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial
in the presence of such
a power, whence he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
received such a Triple-overthrow,
having been him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
broken with those
stones, and hurled down
from that Pinacle and
Mountain, in which he
thought to have batter'd
and broken in pieces the
Salvation of the World by
the overthrow of its Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
Or if perhaps he
would have been so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent,
or so venturous, as
to thrust into the presence
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96725:34"/>
of his Maker, and before
him to issue forth his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
yet this advantage
should <hi>Peter</hi> have had, that
he should have been direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with more light, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
with greater strength
to resist so impudent an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault;
his Faith haply should
bave been confirmed, though
his adversaries malice had
not been abated. And we
know the Devil never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
any, that is not first
overcome of himself. What
danger is there in fighting,
where, there is no danger of
falling? or what difference
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96725:35"/>
is there between an unop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
security, and an assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
strength, save that this
is more glorious, the other
no whit the more safe? He
is not far from Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
who belonging to
Christ, is yet far off from his
presence and assistance. None
nearer the fury of a strong
and bloody malice, than a
weak and stragling enemy.</p>

the pride of Satan to imitate
God; As God magnifies his

out of weakness, so doth the
Devil labour to gain the
glory of a strong enemy, by
the ruinating of a great Saint
with the Temptation of a
weak Sex. Nor is he here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
more apish than cunning:
for the end of the Devils
conflicts is the despair of his
enemy. He gets <hi>Judas</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray

after get him to hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And he hath the same
end in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Denial, which
he had in <hi>Judas</hi> his Treason.
Now what is there that can

greatness in his sin? and
what fall greater, than to be
foiled by a Question by a

aggravate <hi>Peter</hi>'s sin, than
that the voice of a Maid
should be stronger to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him, than the Faith in

Devil tempts us, that he

he tempts us by weak In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
that he may draw
us unto despair.</p>

goes out farther from him.
See what a concord there is
between our Members in
sinning! how the action of
the Foot bears witness to the
apostacy of the Tongue!
But why should <hi>Peter</hi> get
him out for fear of an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment,

having already by
his denial clear'd himself,
and (for ought he sees) sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied

there is no security to be

'Tis not the way to avoid

<hi>Peter</hi> sate boldly amongst

               <p>IS the nature of Woman
more inquisitive, or more
malignant, that amongst so
many other servants, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
should begin the second
accusation? The Devil will
double a weak Temptation,
if it have proved prosperous;
and looks rather to the issue,
than to the Instruments of
his assaults. The first Maid
tempted <hi>Peter</hi> by question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him; this second by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
him to the other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96725:40"/>
from which latter we
may infer, That those who
are aptest to Tempt, are
aptest to Accuse. These
two are the Devils grand
Instruments to work the
ruin of Mankind. He first
tempts a man to sin, and
then he accuseth him to God.
And therefore he hath both
names in an equal propriety,
a <hi>Tempter,</hi> and an <hi>Accuser,</hi>
and these on all sides. He
first tempted man to forsake
his Maker, and accused his
Maker of deceiving man;
next he tempts God to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon man, by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96725:40"/>
man of wickedness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God: and lastly, after
he hath tempted any man
unto sin, he begins to accuse
him to his brethren without,
and his own Conscience
within. Ever when thou
feelest an assault, begin to
fear an accusation; and learn
to prevent the Devils Malice,
by resisting his Temptation.</p>

               <p>WE may here see the
method of Satan. His
first Temptation is by one
only Maid, his second by
many Servants that stood by.
The more weak and naked
he finds us, with the greater
force he makes upon us;
using his first assault to try,
but his second to wound us:
As in the battery or breaking
open of a City, one man may
serve for a spie to watch the
Gates, to take notice of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96725:41"/>
Defences, and to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the weaknesses or
force of either; but when
they are by his report found
unable for resistance, there
then follows the irruption of
a whole army, bringing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the threats of
blood and slaughter: So is it
with Satan towards our Souls;
after he hath sent one smaller
Temptation as a spie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
our Fortifications, and
upon the success and report
of it, finds how weak we
are to withstand his forces,
he then rushes in upon us
with a multitude of his arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96725:42"/>
and more able servants;
who certainly would take
possession of us, and hold us
in peace as their own, did not
a stronger than he come upon
him, and overcome him, and
divide the spoils.</p>

               <p>THE form and manner

the words are, <hi>I know

May not a man know
him, unless he follow him?
No. Behold a mystery of
Faith in the fall of <hi>Peter.</hi> No
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96725:43"/>
man knows Christ unless he
be one of them that follow
him, and to whom he hath
united himself. If it had
been true, <hi>I am not one of
them,</hi> it had been true also,
<hi>I know not the man.</hi> All
knowledg consists in mixture
and union, whereby the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
receiveth into it
the image and similitude of
the thing which it knows;
which made the Philosopher
say, That the Soul in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
a thing is made the
very thing which it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands;
namely, in that sense
as we call the Image of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96725:43"/>
Face in a Glass, the Face it
self; or the Impression in
Wax, the Seal it self. Now
then there is no union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and us, no
dwelling of him in us, no
ingrafture, or incorporation
of us into him, without that
Faith whereby we follow
him, which makes us to be
so nearly one with him, that
(in the judgment of the
learned) the name of Christ
is sometimes in the holy
Scriptures taken for the
Church of Christ. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to those that <hi>believe,</hi> to
them only he hath given to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96725:44"/>
                  <hi>know.</hi> Christ is not truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
either by the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or the understanding. He
is at once known and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd.
It is an Experimental,
and not a Speculative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
that concieves him:
He understands him, that
feels him. We see him in
his Grace and Truth, in his
Word and Promises, not in
any carnal or gross presence.
<hi>Pilate</hi> knew him in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and <hi>Judas,</hi> as well as
<hi>Peter.</hi> A true Believer can
see and know him better in

than a <hi>Papist</hi> can on the

of a Mass-Priest,

Let their Faith have the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of teeth and jaws;

him with less injury, and
with more nourishment.</p>

               <p>THE encrease of the
Enemies Temptation,
accumulates unto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
sin. When <hi>Peter</hi> is pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a second time, and with
more strong opposition, he
conceives a naked and empty
denial, to be an implicite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
and therefore that
he may make them more
credulous, he makes himself
more impious; and to gain
Faith with men, he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denies, but forswears his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96725:45"/>
Faith with God, making
Christ himself the Witness
and Patron not only of a Lie,
but also of a Revolt. With
how deep a die of sin, with
how many degrees of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
will the habit of
Faith consist! That failed
not <hi>Peter,</hi> though the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
thereof were a while
smuther'd and suspended.
Christ's prayer was stronger
to preserve it, than his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
to root it out. That
very action, which if it had
proceeded from a heart qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
with other dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of stubborness, malice,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96725:46"/>
and obduration, would have
been the irremediable sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Holy Ghost; was
in <hi>Peter,</hi> proceeding from
fear and weakness, the sin of
a believing and faithful
heart. How may the Godly
in this one Example both
learn to despair of their own
strength, which cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christ's assistance uphold
them from so deep a fall;
and not to despair of his
mercy, which can keep Faith
in a corner of that very
heart, which lies drench'd
and weltering in its own

Martyrdom a man that

rais'd <hi>Peter</hi> from a sin (I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

confirm'd by a single perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The Devil goes farther

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96725:47"/>

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:96725:48"/>
a curse greater than

It is no wonder if he dare

holy or natural, when
once truly apprehensive of
their object? How secure
and negligent can they make
<hi>Peter</hi> of his eternal estate, to
avoid perhaps but the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure

Christ's mouth in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

mortal men, is of force to
open the eyes of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and impenitent. Christ
in this Crow of the Cock
hath given <hi>Peter</hi> as well an
Example to follow, as an
Occasion to repent; as well
taught him in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Apostleship, as
converted him from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of a backslider. A
true Minister that loves
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96725:52"/>
Christ and his Sheep, must
have the Wings of a
Cock to rouze up first
himself from security; and
then being converted,
powerfully to awaken and
strengthen others: and the
Watchfulness of a Cock, to
be ever ready to discover
and forewarn danger; and
the Voice of a Cock, to
cry aloud, and tell <hi>Israel</hi>
of their sins, and terrifie
the roaring Lion that
seeks to devour them:
and lastly, the Hours of
a Cock, to preach in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and out of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96725:53"/>
the glad tydings of
Salvation.</p>

               <p>WHO would think that
a weak Cock should
be able to do more with

That the noise of a Cock's

deep as the confines of Hell?
Surely no man, if these weak
means were not quickned
and seconded with the look
of Christ. He first turns and

               <p>AND now methinks I
see in the face of Christ,
a throng and a conflict of
Affections. One while I
see an angry and upbraiding
face against <hi>Peter</hi>'s revolt;
another while a pitiful face,
commiserating his frailty;
then a merciful face, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him; and next a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and favourable face, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting
him. If it were a face
of Anger, see then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Faith in <hi>Peter</hi> and all
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96725:56"/>
the Godly, which through
the clouds of his displeasure
can discover the comfortable
light and beams of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
as well as through his
vail of flesh and dishonour,
discern the Power and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of God, like the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the Gospel, whose
Faith could interpret the
very odious name of Dog,
uttered from the mouth of
Christ, to be a trial of her,
and not a rejection; rather
a hiding than a denying of
mercy. If it were a face of
Grace and Invitation, see
the nature of sin, which is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96725:56"/>
to make a man afraid even
of an appeased God; and of
Repentance, which when
the Soul is invited to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of joy which make glad
Gods City, can be at leisure
to drink of those bitter tears,
which make heavy the hearts
of sinners. If it were a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and commiserating face,
see how it works alike Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
in <hi>Peter,</hi> who then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can begin to lament him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
when he is first lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his Saviour. Lord!
never let thy saving face be
turned back from me, but
be thou always pleased to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96725:57"/>
look upon me, whether in
tender displeasure, or in a
pitiful mercy; that so I may
be driven by sorrow out of
my self, and by faith unto
thee.</p>

               <p>THE first beginning of
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance, is
a Remembrance of the words
of Christ, an applicative and
feeling recordation of them.
How powerful is Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to banish out of mans
mind all conceit of Gods
Truth, or his own danger!
He that is too mindful of his
safety, will be too unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of his Faith. A sanctified
Memory, whether in retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Divine Truth, or in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96725:58"/>
presenting our own sins, is
an excellent preparative to
Repentance; and like a
steddy wind, doth collect
and draw together those
clouds, whence shall after
issue forth those happy
tears.</p>

               <p>BUT what was it that
<hi>Peter</hi> remembred? It is
not said, <hi>Peter</hi> now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
how he stood naked
and open to the flames of
Hell, or how he had expos'd
himself to the scourges of an
inward Tormentor, to the
scorchings of a bosom-hell,
his Conscience, or to the
fearful judgment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of him whom he had
injur'd by denying; and
therefore he went out and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96725:59"/>
wept: It was fear that made
him fall, it made him not
repent: But it was only the
merciful prediction of Christ
which he remember'd; what
slight esteem he had made of
that gracious caution which
should have arm'd him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Temptations: and this
made him go out and weep.
The abuse of Gods mercy,
the grieving of Gods Spirit,
the undervaluing of Gods
Truth, more wounds the Soul
of a repentant sinner, than
all the gripes of Conscience,
or flames of Hell.</p>

               <p>BUT what makes thee
(O blessed Convert)
thus to start and turn upon
the Look of thy Lord, and
the remembrance of thy sin,
as if the repentance for the
denial of thy Tongue, had
made thy Foot again to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thy Master? Whither
runnest thou, <hi>Peter,</hi> from such
a fountain of Mercy? Hast
thou either mistaken the
Look of thy Saviour, which
was to draw and reunite
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96725:60"/>
thee unto him, not to drive
or banish thee from him?
or hath thy sorrow drown'd
thy Faith, and made thee
forget that glorious professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which thou once didst
make out of a happy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of experience and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
that Christ had the
words of Eternal Life? and
whither then goest thou?
Hast thou forgotten that he
had balm to cure thy grief,
and blood to blot out thy
sin? that he could at once
both comfort and restore
thee, and render unto thee
thy former joy and grace?
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96725:60"/>
Why didst thou not run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his embraces, and in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of thy repentance and
belief, in thy body lay
hold upon him, and wash
him with thy tears against
his Burial? But behold the
mystery of <hi>Peter's</hi> recover'd
Faith! see how he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
his Saviour when he
turneth from him; and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invested
with the honour of
a Disciple, though he seem
still rather to forsake, than
to follow his Lord. His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
doth in action
confirm, what his Faith once
did in words confess, That
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96725:61"/>
Christ was the Son of the
Living God. Behold in the
departure of <hi>Peter,</hi> an Article
of thy Faith, even the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of thy Saviour. Had
not Christ been as well
without, where <hi>Peter</hi> wept,
as within the Hall where
the <hi>Jews</hi> blasphemed, <hi>Peter</hi>
had again denied, and not
return'd unto his Lord: and
that which is now a mystery,
would have been a revolt.
It is nothing but Faith that
from without could still
through the Walls look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the House, and there
through the infirmity of a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96725:61"/>
buffetted and contemned bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
descry the glory of a
merciful and reconciled God.
It is nothing but Faith that
can from Earth look into the
highest Heaven; and when
it is absent from Christ, not
only groan after him, but
grasp and lay hold upon
him. The Ubiquity of Christ
gives unto that Believer who
hath interest in him, a kind
of Ubiquity also: And as he
is in Earth by his Power,
though in Heaven by his
Presence: So a Believer,
though in his Body on the
Earth, yet is in Heaven by
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96725:62"/>
his Faith. It is the nature of
Faith to give, as subsistence
and being unto things yet to
come, so a kind of presence
also unto things most remote
and distant; and can even
converse, and lay hold on
Christ, though he be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

               <p>BUT what, <hi>Peter!</hi> though
thou canst find thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
without the Hall, is
there no comfort to be taken
in his sensible Presence?
doth the possession of Faith
make vain and fruitless the
fruition of sight? Is it not
some joy to see him, because
it is so much Blessedness to
believe in him? Was there
health in his Garment, and
is there no pleasure in his
Presence? Was the Womb
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96725:63"/>
blessed that held him, and
is there not some blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the eyes that see,
and the hands that embrace
him? Was it from Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which had before
foiled thee, that thou didst
fly as a burnt Child from
the fire? Was the voice of
a Virgin able to drive thee
from the Son of a Virgin;
or the Challenge of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
from the presence of a
Lord? Was not that Look
able to confirm thee, which
was able to convert thee?
Or couldst thou fear to fall
from the Rock, thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96725:63"/>
because thou hadst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faln from the Sand, thy
Presumption? Or was it out
of a loathing of that place
of blasphemy where thy
Master and thy God did
suffer the base reproaches
of wicked men? could the
air of that place be infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
where was so precious,
so innocent, so saving a
breath to sweeten it? Was
the blasphemy of a <hi>Jew</hi>
more pestilent to pollute,
than the Grace of thy Jesus
to sanctifie the High-Priests
Hall? The presence of
Christ could make that place
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96725:64"/>
a Heaven to <hi>Peter,</hi> which
the blasphemies of a <hi>Jew</hi>
had made his Hell. It was
neither the vileness of the
place, nor the question of a
Servant which could have
done thee any violence.
They might tempt, they
could not wound thee. A
Mountain stands unmov'd
though the Winds be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous,
when a smaller
breath not only shakes but
breaks down a reed. If thy
Lord have given thee
strength, thy Adversary
cannot give thee a fall: If
he beckon on thee to turn,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96725:64"/>
thou art by his finger suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
arm'd against a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a Devil, much more
against a Temptation, a Maid.
But such is the recovery of
Faith, as of Health, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
by degrees, from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unto strength, from fear
unto confidence, and dares
not trust in Christ without
some trembling. <hi>Peter</hi> is assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of his Master's love, and
yet he is ashamed of his own
sin. Shame is ever sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.
He durst not to
look that Master in the face,
whom so lately he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied:
He could with the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96725:65"/>
Publican knock his breast, he
could not look up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to the face of his Master;
he could pray unto Christ,
he could not accompany
him. And as the modesty of
nature makes a man able to
deliver more of his mind in
absence than in presence: so
the shame of sin makes <hi>Peter</hi>
more confident without, than
within the Hall.</p>

               <p>WE find not that <hi>Peter</hi>
after this, saw Christ
till his Resurrection: And
then none so particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
unto his sight, none so
forward and hasty to have
recourse unto the Garden.
Was it grief at his Master's
misery, or at his own sin
(with the lamentation of
both which, he could best in
private glut himself)? or was
it fear of the Majesty in his
Master's face, or of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96725:66"/>
in his own breast,
which drave him out of the
Hall to weep? surely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
all. He departed from
the face of his Lord, from
the company of his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
provoked thereunto
by the shame of his Fall,
by the experience of his
frailty: He departed from
the committing of more sin,
from the sight of more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
because he knew not
whether he should find more
mercy, or be able to bear
more sorrow. But when
once Christ through the
power of his Resurrection,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96725:66"/>
had cloth'd himself with
Glory, and <hi>Peter</hi> by the
Angels message was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth'd
of fear, none more
hasty to enjoy the benefit
of his real Presence. He
ran, and went down into
the Sepulcher, not hoping
to see there a weak and
captive body, but (as he
did) a conquer'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
grave; only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of weakness, and the
witnesses of power. What
haste, think we, made he to
rise up unto his Saviour's
Kingdom, that was so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to go down into his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96725:67"/>
grave? when Nature is
rais'd up from her ruins and
decays, when the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is cleans'd from the
guilt of sin, or burden of
sorrow, when a lapsed Saint
hath regain'd his measure of
Grace and Tranquility, he
is so much the more spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in Heavenly pursuits,
by how much his former fall
had been a disadvantage to
his progress: and those sharp
sins which, being acted,
did wound him, do now,
being remembred, only spur
him forward in his way.
The very sins of the Godly,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96725:67"/>
contrary to the barrenness of
their own nature (which
bringeth forth nothing but
death), are by the Mercy
and Wisdom of God, made
fruitful and of use unto
them. The Devil in woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them, wounds himself;
and though his fiery darts
may perhaps at first find
entrance; yet when they
come to the bottom of a
faithful heart, they meet
there with a Rock of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from whence they are
driven back into the face of
him that threw them. When
the Devil batters any one
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96725:68"/>
Vertue in a Saint, he does in
the issue nothing else but
pluck out the stones of his
own building. Though he
breaks <hi>David</hi>'s bones, though
he sift and winnow <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Faith; yet both, when they
are restor'd, will be like a
broken bone, stronger; and
like Wheat sifted, finer;
and will also by instructing
and confirming of others;
draw more men from him,
than he before had done
Graces from them.</p>
