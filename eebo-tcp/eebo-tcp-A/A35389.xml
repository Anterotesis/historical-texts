            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Book of <hi>JOB</hi> beares the <hi>Image</hi> of theſe times, and preſents us with a reſemblance of the paſt, preſent, and (much hoped for) future condition of this <hi>Nation.</hi> As the perſonall proſperity of <hi>Job,</hi> ſo his troubles looke like our Nationall troubles; and why may not the parallel be made up, by a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse in our Reſtauration? <hi>Job</hi> was the most flouriſhing, the greateſt man, of all the men of the Eaſt. We are the greateſt, and lately were the moſt flouriſhing <hi>Nation,</hi> of all the <hi>Nations</hi> of the <hi>North. Our Oxen</hi> (like his) <hi>were ſtrong to labour, our Sheep brought forth thouſands, and ten thouſands in our ſtreets, our garners were full, affording all manner of ſtore; our ſonnes</hi> (like his) <hi>as plants growne up in their youth, our daughters as corner ſtones poliſhed after the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of a palace. There was no breaking-in nor going out, no complaining</hi> (in reference to outward wants) <hi>in our ſtreets. We waſhed our ſteps with butter, and the rock powred us out rivers of oyl. The Candle of God ſhined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:98733:3"/>
our Heads, and the ſecret of God was upon our Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: Our roots were ſpread out by the waters, and the dew</hi> (of bleſsings) <hi>lay all night upon our branches. Unto us the Nations gave ear and waited, &amp; kept ſilence at our counſel; After our words, they ſpake not again, and our ſpeech drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon them; If we laughed on them, they believed it not: our glory was freſh in us, and the light of our countenance they caſt not down: we choſe out their way, and ſate chief and dwelt as a King in the army, as one that comforteth the Mourners.</hi> Surely, a happy <hi>people</hi> were <hi>we,</hi> being in ſuch a <hi>caſe,</hi> yea moſt <hi>happy were we,</hi> having the Lord (many ways declaring himſelfe) for our God. And had we (as theſe <hi>mercies</hi> did oblige us) fill'd up, or labour'd to fill up th'other part, the <hi>better part</hi> of <hi>Jobs character</hi>? Had we beene a <hi>People per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> and <hi>upright, fearing God and eſchewing evill</hi>? We might (according to the promis'd, and often experienc'd <hi>tenour</hi> of <hi>Gods dealing</hi> with his <hi>people</hi>) have continued and encreaſed in all that <hi>happineſſe</hi> unto this day.</p>
            <p>But We (herein unlike to <hi>Job,</hi> and) like a <hi>fooliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>unwiſe,</hi> have <hi>ill-requited the Lord,</hi> yea, we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited the <hi>Lord with evill,</hi> for, and in the midſt of all this <hi>Goodneſſe.</hi> Our <hi>Provocations</hi> have bin <hi>many,</hi> and our <hi>Backe-ſlidings</hi> have bin <hi>multiplied.</hi> Our <hi>ſinnes</hi> have put a <hi>Sword</hi> into the <hi>Hand</hi> of God: And God in <hi>Juſtice,</hi> hath put a <hi>Sword</hi> into the <hi>Hands of unjuſt men,</hi> men <hi>skilfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.</hi> He hath made <hi>Babylonians</hi> the <hi>rod of his anger and the ſtaffe of his Indignation againſt us.</hi> He hath given <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to <hi>Caldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans,</hi> who <hi>rob</hi> and <hi>ſpoyle</hi> us. <hi>Our young men are ſlaine by the edge of the Sword,</hi> and the <hi>ſtinke of our Campes comes up into our Noſtrils.</hi> How many <hi>ſad Meſſengers</hi> have <hi>haſtened</hi> unto us (as unto <hi>Job</hi>) with the <hi>Reports</hi> of <hi>Cities ſurrendered</hi> and <hi>plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> of <hi>Townes fired</hi> and <hi>pillaged,</hi> of <hi>Villages</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

laid waſte,</hi> and almoſt <hi>deſolate.</hi> Now ſeeing all this is <hi>come upon us,</hi> is it not time for us (with <hi>Job</hi>) to <hi>rent our Garments</hi> (yea <hi>our hearts with godly ſorrow</hi>) and falling upon the <hi>ground, worſhip God</hi> and ſay, <hi>The Lord hath</hi> (freely) <hi>given, and the Lord hath</hi> (juſtly) <hi>taken; Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> Our <hi>ſinnes</hi> have brought theſe <hi>ſorrowes,</hi> let not our <hi>ſorrowes</hi> bring in more <hi>ſin,</hi> by cauſing us to <hi>murmur</hi> against, or <hi>charge God fooliſhly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God never ſends ſuch <hi>troubles</hi> upon a <hi>Nation,</hi> (he doth ſometimes upon a <hi>Perſon</hi> and did upon <hi>Job</hi>) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>cauſe</hi>; that is, without reſpecting ſinne as a cauſe. <hi>Job</hi> might ſay (in one ſenſe) <hi>My Uprightneſſe and my Integritie have procured theſe things unto me</hi>; But wee must ſay, <hi>our way and our doings have procured theſe things unto us: This is our wickednes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet (though all this <hi>evill</hi> hath been <hi>done by us,</hi> though all theſe <hi>evils</hi> are <hi>come upon us,</hi> yet) <hi>there is hope in our Iſrael concerning this thing,</hi> yea, I beleeve, there is <hi>mercie</hi> in and from all theſe evils, to us and all the <hi>Iſrael of our God.</hi> Onely, what <hi>Integrity we have,</hi> let us ſtill <hi>hold it ſtedfaſtly,</hi> what <hi>evils</hi> are (and what evils almoſt are not?) amongſt us, let us <hi>reforme them ſpeedily;</hi> Without this, at leaſt, without <hi>hearty deſires,</hi> and <hi>faithfull endeavours</hi> after this, wee may <hi>preſume,</hi> but we cannot <hi>beleeve</hi> or <hi>hope</hi> our <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> I grant, that whenſoever <hi>God reſtores us,</hi> he must <hi>reſtore us freely,</hi> and must both make us <hi>good,</hi> and doe us <hi>good,</hi> for his owne Name ſake, in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> For as he hath <hi>puniſhed</hi> us <hi>leſſe</hi> then our <hi>ſinnes deſerve,</hi> ſo when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, or in what degree ſoever he reſtores us, it will bee more then any, or all our <hi>repentings</hi> and <hi>reformings</hi> can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: yet he commands us to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>reforme,</hi> that we may be <hi>reſtored.</hi> God never <hi>delivered</hi> any people for
<pb facs="tcp:98733:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their <hi>Repentance,</hi> and rarely any (if any) without <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Yea I may ſay it plainely, that he never <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> any (in <hi>Mercie</hi>) without <hi>Repentance,</hi> for either he gave them <hi>Repentance,</hi> before they were <hi>delivered,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> (which is farre the greater bleſſing of the two) with the <hi>Deliverance.</hi> Better have our <hi>troubles</hi> continue, then our <hi>ſinnes</hi> continue. To have <hi>Peace returne</hi> and our <hi>hearts unturn'd,</hi> were infinitely worſe then <hi>warre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Repentance</hi> is better then <hi>Peace,</hi> ſo it will be an argument, that we ſhall have <hi>Peace:</hi> May wee not well conclude that God is upon the <hi>giving-hand,</hi> when he gives a <hi>new heart</hi>? And that hee hath ſomewhat elſe to give, when he hath given a <hi>love</hi> unto, and a <hi>longing after</hi> his <hi>Truth</hi>?</p>
            <p>When God feeds us with (and we have a right <hi>taſte</hi> of) this <hi>Manna</hi> in our <hi>Wilderneſſe,</hi> wee may rest aſſured that God hath <hi>humbled us</hi> all this while (and all the while his <hi>Wiſdome</hi> ſhall ſee fit to <hi>humble</hi> us yet, will be) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>proove</hi> us, that he may <hi>doe us good at our latter end,</hi> and make this <hi>Nation</hi> (at leaſt) like <hi>Job,</hi> in the end, which he will make.</p>
            <p>Yee have heard of the <hi>Patience</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> and what <hi>end</hi> the Lord made? Could we but heare of the <hi>Repentance</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> all the world (I am perſwaded) ſhould <hi>heare</hi> and <hi>wonder</hi> at the <hi>end,</hi> which the Lord would make: Even ſuch an <hi>end</hi> as he made for <hi>Job,</hi> if not a better; he would give us twice as much in <hi>Temporals,</hi> double <hi>Riches,</hi> double <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> and <hi>Sheepe,</hi> double <hi>Bracelets</hi> and <hi>Earings,</hi> double <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> double <hi>Sonnes</hi> and <hi>Daughters:</hi> And hee would give us (which is not ſpecified in the <hi>Inventorie</hi> of <hi>Jobs repaire) ſeven-fold</hi> more in <hi>Spirituals, ſeven-fold</hi> more <hi>knowledge</hi> of his <hi>Truth, purity</hi> in his <hi>worſhip, order</hi> in his <hi>houſe;</hi> he would make the light of our <hi>Moone</hi> to be
<pb facs="tcp:98733:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the perſonall wiſh and reſolution of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, I had rather ſpeak five words with my underſtanding,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.19.</note> 
               <hi>then ten thouſand words in an unknowne tongue.</hi> And ſurely it is far better to ſpeake or heare <hi>five words</hi> of Scripture with our underſtandings, than <hi>ten thouſand words,</hi> yea, than the whole Scriptures, while we underſtand them not. Now, what <hi>an unknown tongue,</hi> about which the Apoſtle there diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, is, in reference unto all, the ſame is the Scripture unto moſt, even in their owne tongue, that which they underſtand not. For as an unknowne tongue doth alwayes hide the meaning of words from us: ſo doe oft times the ſpiritualneſſe, and myſteriouſneſſe of the matter. While a man ſpeakes in a ſtrange language wee heare a ſound, but know not the words; and while a man ſpeakes in our owne language, though we know the words, yet we may not underſtand the meaning; and then hee that ſpeakes is to us in that reference (ſo the Apoſtle calls him) a <hi>Barbarian.</hi> While the leaves of the booke are opened and read to ſuch or by ſuch, the ſenſe is ſhut up and ſealed.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle <hi>Philip</hi> heard the <hi>Ethiopian Eunuch</hi> reade the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> as he traveld in his Chariot, hee ſaid to him,<note place="margin">Act. 8.31.</note> 
               <hi>underſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt?</hi> The Eunuch anſwered,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98733:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
How ſhould I unleſſe ſome man would guide mee? He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the language; but the meaning was under a vaile. The very ſame may we ſay to many, who reade the Scriptures, underſtand you what you reade? And they may anſwer as the Eunuch did, How can we except we had ſome man to guide us? Yea, and alas, for all the guiding of man, they may anſwer, How can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we have the Spirit of God to guide us? <hi>He hath his Pulpit in heaven, who teacheth hearts, the heart of Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> (we know) was a learned Phariſee, and much verſt in the Law, and yet he ſaith of himſelfe before his converſion, that hee was <hi>without the Law:</hi> but when Chriſt came to him, then the Commandment came to him.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.9.</note> 
               <hi>I was once alive without the Law, but when the Commandment came</hi>; that is, <hi>when Chriſt came,</hi> and his Spirit came in or after my converſion, and expounded the Commandment to my heart, then the Commandment came, <hi>ſc.</hi> to my heart in the power of it, and I underſtood to purpoſe what the Law was. So that the teachings of the Spirit, the teachings of God himſelfe, are chiefly to be looked after and prayed for, that we may know the mind of the Spirit, the will of God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>But he hath ſet up this ordinance, the ordinance of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to doe it by;<note place="margin">

                  </gap>. Cor. 14.13.</note> both that the Scripture might be tranſlated out of the Originall into the common language of every Nation (which the Apoſtle calls interpreting in that place before cited) and alſo that the originall ſenſe of the Scripture might be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the minde and underſtanding of every man; which is the worke we aime at and now have in hand.</p>
            <p>Before I begin that, give me leave to beſeech you in the Name of Chriſt, to take care for the carrying on of this worke a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree further: I mean to tranſlate the ſenſe of Scripture into your lives, and to expound the word of God by your workes, <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it by your feet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 6.13.</note> 
               <hi>and teach it by your fingers</hi>; (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes to another ſenſe) that is, let your working and your walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be Scripture explications. It is indeed a very great honour unto this Citie, that you take care for a <hi>Commentarie</hi> on the Scripture in writing; but if you will be carefull and diligent to make a <hi>Commentarie</hi> upon the Scripture by living, or to make your lives the <hi>Commentarie</hi> of Scripture, this will make your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie glorious indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.2, 3.</note>It is the Apoſtles teſtimonie of his Corinthians, <hi>Yee</hi> (ſaith he)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98733:7"/>
               <hi>are our Epiſtle, for as much as yee are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtred by us, written not with inke, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of ſtone, but in fleſhie tables of the heart.</hi> Give us we beſeech you, the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of glorying on your behalfe, that we may ſay, <hi>You are our Expoſitions,</hi> for as much as you are manifeſtly declared in your practiſe to be the expoſition of the mind of Chriſt miniſtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by us. A walking, a breathing <hi>Commentarie</hi> goeth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beyond the written or ſpoken <hi>Commentarie.</hi> And as the Apoſtle makes his concluſion (before noted) I had rather ſpeake five words with my underſtanding, than ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue. So I ſay, I had rather know five words of Scripture by my own practiſe and experience, than ten thouſand words of Scripture, yea than the whole Scripture, by the bare Expoſition of another. And therefore let the word of Chriſt by theſe verball Explications, dwell richly in your underſtandings in all wiſedome: And by a practicall application, let it be held forth plentifully in your lives in all holineſſe. Adde Commentarie to Commentarie, and Expoſition to Expoſition: adde the Comment of works to this Comment of words, and an Expoſition by your lives to this Expoſition by our labours.</p>
            <p>Surely if you do not, theſe Exerciſes will be coſtly indeed, and will come to a deep account againſt you before the Lord. <hi>If you are lifted up to heaven by the opening of the Scripture</hi> (which is either a carrying of you up to heaven, or a bringing of heaven downe to you) and then walke groveling upon the earth; how ſore will the judgement be! But it is to me an argument and an evidence from heaven; that God hath put it into your hearts to be more glorious in the practiſe of holineſſe, becauſe he hath put it into your hearts to deſire more the knowledge of holineſſe.</p>
            <p>To draw in my ſpeech nearer to the buſineſſe. Having a booke full of very various matter before me, give mee leave to premiſe ſome things in the generall, and ſome thing more particulars, by way of Preface concerning the booke, before wee come to the handling of the text.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the generall. That which God ſpeakes concerning the whole worke of Creation,<note place="margin">Can. 1.3.</note> We may ſpeake concerning the whole booke of Scripture, <hi>It is very good. Solomon</hi> obſerves, that <hi>whereſoever the wiſdom of God ſpake, it ſpake of excellent things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro, 8.6.</note> And <hi>David,</hi> to quicken our endeavours and excite our diligence

to the ſtudy of the word, preferreth it in worth above <hi>thouſands of gold and ſilver, and in ſweetneſſe above the honey and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney combe.</hi> And when he ceaſeth to compare, hee beginneth to admire, <hi>Wonderfull are thy Teſtimonies.</hi> And well may that bee called Wonderfull,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> which proceedeth from the God of Wonders. <hi>All Scripture is given by divine inſpiration,</hi> or by inſpiration from God; and I need not ſtay to ſhew you the excellencie of any part, when I have but pointed at ſuch an originall of the whole.</p>
            <p>As therefore the whole Scripture, (whether wee reſpect the majeſtie of the Author, the height or puritie of the matter, the depth or perſpicuitie of the ſtile, the dignitie or variety of occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; whether we conſider the Art of compiling, or the ſtrength of arguing) diſdaines the very mention of <hi>compariſon,</hi> with any other humane Author whatſoever: ſo are <hi>compariſons</hi> in it ſelfe, as Booke with Booke, Chapter with Chapter, dangerous. There is not in this great volume of holy counſell, any one Book or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Verſe or Section, of greater power or authoritie than other. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> the writings of <hi>Amos</hi> the Shepherd, and of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> a Deſcendant of the blood Royall; the writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Evangeliſts, the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi> and this hiſtorie of <hi>Iob,</hi> muſt be received (to uſe the words of the <hi>Trent Councell</hi> in the fifth Seſſion, but to far better purpoſe) <hi>Pari pietatis affectu, with the ſame holy reverence and affection.</hi> They uſe it about Traditions, matching Traditions with the Scriptures; but we may fully match all Scripture together, and ſay, all muſt be received with the ſame devotion and affection.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding, as the parts of Scripture were penned by divers Secretaries, publiſhed in divers places, in divers ages, on divers occaſions, for divers ends: ſo the argument and ſubject matter, the method and manner of compoſing, the texture and the ſtile of writing are likewiſe different. Some parts of Scripture were delivered in Proſe, others in Verſe or numbers: ſome parts of the Scripture are Hiſtoricall, ſhewing what hath beene done; ſome are Propheticall, ſhewing what ſhall be done; others are Dogmaticall or Doctrinall, ſhewing what we muſt doe, what we muſt beleeve. Againe, ſome parts of Scripture are cleare and eaſie, ſome are obſcure and very knotty: Some parts of Scripture ſhew what God made us, others, how ſinne ſpoiled us: A third, how Chriſt reſtored us. Some parts of Scripture ſhew forth acts of mercy to keepe us from ſinking; others record acts of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98733:8"/>
to keepe us from preſuming. And becauſe the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is not ſtrewed with Roſes, but, like the Crowne of Chriſt here upon earth, ſet with thornes; becauſe not ſmiles and loving imbracements from the world, but wounds, and ſtroaks, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, doe await all thoſe that have received <hi>the preſſe-money of the Spirit, and are enrolled for the Chriſtian warfare:</hi> becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <hi>true Iſraelite</hi> muſt expect that which <hi>Iacob</hi> upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed ſpake of <hi>Ioſeph, that the Archers will ſhoot at him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49 23.</note> 
               <hi>hate him and grieve him:</hi> In a word, becauſe many are the troubles of the righteous; therefore the Scripture doth preſent us with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry plat-formes of the righteous conflicting with many troubles.</p>
            <p>Now theſe conſiderations that are ſcattered ſeverally thorow the whole Scripture, ſeeme all concenter'd, and vnited together in this booke of <hi>Iob:</hi> which if we conſider in the ſtile and forme of writing, is in ſome part of it Proſe, as the two firſt Chapters and part of the laſt, and the reſt is Verſe. If wee conſider it in the manner of deliverie, it is both darke and cleare. If we conſider the ſubject matter of it, it is both Hiſtoricall, Propheticall, and Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. In it is a mixture of mercie tendred unto, of judgements threatned againſt, and inflicted upon the wicked. In it is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the greateſt outward bleſſings, and the greateſt outward afflictions upon the godly, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>luding in the greateſt deliverances of the godly from affliction. In this laſt the booke is chief: there was never any man under a <hi>warmer ſinne</hi> of outward proſperitie than <hi>Iob</hi> was; neither was there ever any man in a <hi>hotter fire</hi> of outward affliction then <hi>Iob</hi> was, God ſeeming to give charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this triall of <hi>Iob,</hi> as king <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the three children, to have the <hi>furnace heated ſeven times hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ordinary.</hi> This in the generall concerning the book.</p>
            <p>Now more particularly. I will not detaine you in that Proemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſquiſition about the Author and Penman of this Booke, there is great varietie of Iudgement about it, ſome ſay it was one of the Prophets; but they know not who; ſome aſcribe it to <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſome to <hi>Elihu,</hi> not a few to <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe; but moſt give it to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> That reſolution of <hi>Beza</hi> in the point ſhall ſerve me, and may ſatisfie you. <note n="*" place="margin">

Onely take this, that it is conceived to be the firſt piece of Scripture that was written: take it to be written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and then it is moſt probable that hee writ it before the deliverance of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> while he was in <hi>Midian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither will I ſtay you in the ſecond place about the inquirie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or rather about the refutation of that fancie: that this whole Booke is a Parable rather than a Hiſtorie; like that of <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Luke 15. &amp; 16.</note> not a thing really acted; but only a repreſentation of it. Now this (which was the dreame of many of the <hi>Iewes and Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudiſts,</hi> and is faſtned with no ſmall clamour upon <hi>Luther</hi> by the <hi>Ieſuits</hi>) may clearly be convinced both by the names of places and perſons (which we ſhall have occaſion to open when wee come to the booke it ſelfe) and alſo by thoſe allegations of the Prophets and of the Apoſtles concerning <hi>Iob</hi>; the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> quoting him with <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 14.14.</note> two men that unqueſtionably were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and acted glorious parts in the world, and therefore <hi>Iob</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>All that I will ſay in particular, ſhall be in theſe three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To ſhew you more diſtinctly the ſubject of this Book.</item>
               <item>2. The parts and diviſion of it.</item>
               <item>3. The uſe or ſcope and intendment of it.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. For the ſubject of this Booke, we may conſider it, either as principall, or as collaterall.</p>
            <p>The maine and principall ſubject of this Book is contained, (and I may give it you) in one verſe of the 34. Pſalme. <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſal. 34.19.</note> 
               <hi>but the Lord delivereth him out of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning this ſubject, there are two great <hi>Queſtions</hi> handled and diſputed fully and clearly in this Booke. The firſt is this. <hi>Whether it doth conſiſt with the Iuſtice and goodneſſe of God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a righteous and ſincere perſon, to ſtrip him naked, to take away all his outward comforts.</hi> Or <hi>whether it doth conſiſt with the Iuſtice and goodneſſe of God, that it ſhould go ill with thoſe that are good, and that it ſhould go well with thoſe that are evill.</hi> This is one great debate, the maine Queſtion thoroughout the Book. And then ſecondly, here is another great diſpute in reference to the former. Namely, <hi>whether we may iudge of the righteouſneſſe, or unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, of the ſincerity or hypocriſie of any perſon, by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dealings and preſent diſpenſations of God towards him.</hi> That is a ſecond Queſtion here debated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98733:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>The friends of <hi>Job</hi> maintained the firſt Queſtion negatively, the latter affirmatively. They denied that God in Juſtice could aflict a righteous and a holy man. They affirmed, that any man ſo afflicted is unrighteous, and may ſo be judged, becauſe afflicted. And ſo the whole argument and diſpute, which the friends of <hi>Job</hi> brought, may be reduced to this one Syllogiſme. <hi>He that is afflicted and greatly afflicted, is certainly a great open ſinner or a notorious hypocrite: But</hi> Job, <hi>thou art afflicted, and thou art greatly afflicted. Therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thou art, if not, a great open ſinner, yet a notorious hypocrite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job,</hi> as conſtantly and as vehemently maintaineth both thoſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions in the contrary ſenſe. He acknowledged himſelf to be <hi>a ſinner,</hi> yet he ſtiffely denied that he was a hypocrite; he diſclaimed his own righteouſnes in point of Juſtification, yet he juſtified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in point of uprightneſſe. And as for the ſinfulneſſe of his nature and of his life, he was willing (except knowne or wilfull inſincerity) to own both, and charge himſelfe faſter, then his friends could, appealing to, and triumphing in free-Grace, for full pardon.</p>
            <p>This one Syllogiſme (I ſay) is the ſumme of all the diſpute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Job</hi> and his three friends; This is (as it were) the hinge, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the whole matter turned.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe, there are many diſcourſes falling in <hi>collateral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which concurre to make up the ſubject of this book: For, as it is with thoſe that ſtudie the <hi>Philoſophers-ſtone,</hi> the great thing they aime at, is to make gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that's the principall, the chiefe end: yet collaterally they find out many excellent things, many profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table experiments have beene made, many rare ſecrets have beene diſcovered in proſecuting of that great deſigne. So although this be the principall ſubject of the booke, yet collaterally for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of theſe diſputes, many other rare and excellent, heavenly, ſpirituall and uſefull truths are handled and diſcovered. As to give you ſome particular inſtances.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We have the <hi>Character</hi> of a diſcreet and faithfull Maſter and Father in a family, and the ſpeciall duties which concern thoſe relations; The doctrine of the Oeconomicks is often touched in this Booke.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have here the <hi>Character</hi> of a faithfull, zealous and juſt Magiſtrate in the Common-wealth, how he ought to behave himſelfe, and what his duty is, ſet downe alſo plainly and clearly by occaſion of this diſpute.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We have a great diſcovery made in the ſecrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98733:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The bowels of nature are as it were ript open, and the great works of Creation are here diſplayed. In this you have diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Heavens, of the Earth, of the Sunne, Moone and Starres: of thoſe Meteors, the Haile, the Snow, the Froſt, the Yce, the Lightning and the thunder. In this you have diſcourſes of Jewels, of Minerals and of Metalls; In this, of Beaſts, and Birds, and cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping things. So that by occaſion of this diſpute, a diſcourſe is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about all the world, in the whole circuit of naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Here are diſcourſes of Chriſtian Moralls, of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of equity from man to man: Of the duties of piety which man oweth to God, of the duties of ſobriety and temperance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a mans own ſelfe. Yea here we find the great duty of <hi>Faith, the matter of beleeving in the Redeemer of the world, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Here are many diſcoveries made of <hi>God,</hi> in Himſelfe and in his Attributes: in his Power, Wiſdome, Juſtice, Goodneſſe and Faithfulneſſe, yea, whatſoever may be known of God in any of theſe, is ſome way or other here diſcovered. So then, all being ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up together, it may well be ſaid concerning this Booke, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Book containing all excellencies, of wiſedom and holineſſe: and what (as ſome of the Jews and Rabbins ſay of it) in other Books, is <hi>here a little and there a little,</hi> is all plentifully gathered together in this. In a word, it is a <hi>Summary,</hi> a <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of all knowledg, both humane and divine, both concerning our ſelves, and concerning God. So much of the ſubject of this Book, both principall and Collaterall.</p>
            <p>The ſecond generall to be conſidered is the diviſion of this Booke. We may conſider it in reference to the diviſion; Firſt, as it is a Dialogue (for ſo ſome call the whole Booke) which is an interchangeable diſcourſe concerning any ſubject or matter what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And taking it in that notion, wee may divide it by the <hi>Collocutors</hi> or <hi>Speakers,</hi> and by the ſeverall ſpeeches which they made.</p>
            <p>The Collocutors or Speakers in this Booke, are Eight.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>God.</hi>

               </item>
               <item>8. <hi>Elihu,</hi> Who commeth in as a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour of that diſpute.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98733:10"/>Their Speeches which they make, are in the whole compaſſe of of the Booke, 32. diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>There are two Dialogues betweene God and Sathan. One be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Iob</hi> and his wife. Three between <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> Three betweene <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Bildad.</hi> Two betweene <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Zophar.</hi> Two betweene God and <hi>Iob.</hi> And then we have <hi>Elihu</hi> making foure diſtinct Speeches or Orations which have no Anſwer. And laſtly, two ſeverall Speeches or Parables (as they are called) of <hi>Iob,</hi> one in <hi>Chapt.</hi> 27.1. and the other in <hi>Chapt.</hi> 29.1. So that ſumme up all theſe together, and you may divide the whole Booke into 32. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct or ſeverall Speeches, either by way of poſition, or anſwer, or reply, or determination. God ſpeakes foure times, Satan twice, <hi>Iobs</hi> wife once, <hi>Iob</hi> thirteene times, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> thrice, <hi>Bildad</hi> thrice, <hi>Zophar</hi> twice, <hi>Elihu</hi> foure times.</p>
            <p>Or if we ſhould conſider the Booke as a <hi>Diſputation,</hi> (which is higher then a <hi>Dialogue,</hi>) ſo you may diſtinguiſh it, by the <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,</hi> by the <hi>Reſpondent,</hi> and by the <hi>Moderators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Opponents</hi> are three. <hi>Iobs</hi> three friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe is <hi>Reſpondent.</hi> The <hi>Moderators</hi> are,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Elihu,</hi> he commeth in firſt as an <hi>Vmpire</hi> betweene them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God himſelfe at laſt, out of the whirle-winde giveth the deciſive determinative voice and ſentence. He ſtates the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion fully for <hi>Iob,</hi> and reproveth <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, as not having diſputed and argued aright concerning him.</p>
            <p>Yet further. Wee may divide the Booke into five Sections, whereof</p>
            <p>The firſt doth ſet forth the happineſſe and fullneſſe of <hi>Iobs out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate</hi>; and the integrity and perfection of his <hi>ſpirituall estate.</hi> And that is conteined in the firſt 5 <hi>verſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond preſents <hi>Iobs affliction, Iobs</hi> fall, the great and ſore calamity which in a moment did overtake him, with the occaſion of it. And this you have ſet forth from that 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> excluſively to the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, We have the queſtions, the debates and diſputes which did ariſe upon and about the fall of <hi>Iob</hi> into that ſad condition: which are contained from that 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Chapter,</hi> to the end of the 31. <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, We have the Moderation or determination of this diſpute and of this argument, firſt by <hi>Elihu,</hi> and then by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, from the beginning of the 32. <hi>Chapter,</hi> to the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98733:11"/>
the 42. All which is but as a determination or ſtating of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly. Wee have the reſtitution of <hi>Iob,</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring and ſetting up againe, and the repairing of his eſtate and making of it double to what formerly it had bin. And that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and continued from the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 42. <hi>Chapter,</hi> to the end of the Book. So here you have a five-fold diviſion of the Book.</p>
            <p>Once more. We may divide the Book into theee parts. And ſo it ſets forth;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Iobs</hi> happy condition, both in regard of externalls and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, in the firſt 5. <hi>verſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Iobs</hi> fall, <hi>Iobs</hi> calamity, <hi>Iobs</hi> trouble, from that to the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 42. <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Iobs</hi> reſtitution or reſtoring, from thence to the end.</p>
            <p>Take the Book in this diviſion, and it ſeemes to hold forth to us ſuch a repreſentation of <hi>Iob,</hi> as is given us in the three firſt <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of <hi>Geneſis</hi> concerning man. In thoſe 3. firſt <hi>Chapters,</hi> we have man ſet forth;</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the excellency and dignity of his Creation, being Lord and Soveraigne of all, adorn'd with that integrity and purity of nature which God had planted in and ſtamped upon him at his creation. And in the beginning of this Book, we have <hi>Iob</hi> like a man in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, ſhining in all his dignitie, compaſs'd about with bleſſings of all ſorts, bleſſings of the body, bleſſings of the ſoule, bleſſings of this life and of that which is to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There we find the Devill plotting the ruine of man, and we find his plot taking for a while, and in a great meaſure prevailing. So here in this Booke we have the Devill begging <hi>Iobs</hi> ruine, and having obtained leave, ſo farre as concerned his outward eſtate and body, quickly puts it in execution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There we have <hi>Adam</hi> by Gods free mercy and promiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to a better eſtate in Chriſt through the grace of Redemption, then he had before in himſelfe, by the goodneſſe of Creation. So here we have <hi>Iob,</hi> through the mercy, power and faithfulneſſe of God, reſtored to all he had, and more, we ſee him repaired and ſet up againe after his breaking, not only with a new ſtock, but a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: his eſtate being doubled, and his very loſſes proving beneficiall to him. This may ſuffice for the diviſion or parts of the Booke, which I conceive may ſhed ſome light into the whole.</p>
            <p>Now for the third thing which I propoſed, which was the uſe, or ſcope, or intendment of this Book. For that is a ſpeciall thing we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98733:11"/>
are to carry before us in our eye in the reading of Scripture. It is poſſible for one to underſtand the ſubject, and to know the parts, and yet not to be attentive to find out, or diſtinctly to find out what the mind of God is, or whereat he ſpecially drives and aimeth. Therefore it will be very profitable to us likewiſe, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what the tendency and intendment, or (as I may ſo ſpeake) the Uſes of this Booke are.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It aimes at our Inſtruction, and that in divers things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, (Which much concernes every Chriſtian to learne,) it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth us <hi>how to handle a Croſſe.</hi> How to behave our ſelves when we are in a conflict, whether outward or inward. What the Poſtures of the Spirituall Warre are; and with what patience we ought to beare the hand of God and his dealings with us. This I ſay is ſet forth by the Scripture in other places to be the maine and one of the principall ends or intendments or Uſes of this Booke. This the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes of.<note place="margin">Iames 5.11.</note> 
               <hi>You have heard of the patience of</hi> Job. As if he ſhould ſay, doe you not know why the Book of <hi>Iob</hi> was written? Why God in his providence did bring ſuch a thing to paſſe concerning <hi>Iob?</hi> It was that all men ſhould take notice of his patience, and might <hi>learne the wiſedome of ſuffering, that noble art of induring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iob</hi> was full of many other excellent graces, and indeed he had all the graces of the Spirit of God in him. But the <hi>Patience of</hi> Job was the principall grace. As it is with naturall men, they have every ſinne in them, but there are ſome ſinnes which are the <hi>Master ſinnes,</hi> or ſome one ſinne it may be doth denominate a wicked man; ſometimes he is a proud man, ſometimes he is covetous, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is a deceiver, ſometimes he is an oppreſſor, ſometimes he is uncleane, ſometimes he hath a profane ſpirit, and ſo the like; ſome one great Maſter luſt doth give the denomination to the man, he hath all other ſinnes in him, and they are all raigning in him, but one as it were raigneth above the reſt, and ſits uppermoſt in his heart. So it is with the Saints of God (and here with <hi>Iob</hi>) every Saint and ſervant of God hath all grace in him, every grace in ſome degree or other, for all the limbs and liniaments of the new man are formed together in the ſoule of thoſe that are in Chriſt. But there is ſome ſpeciall grace which doth give (as it were) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to a ſervant of God. As that which gave the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to <hi>Abraham</hi> was faith, and that which gave the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to <hi>Moſes</hi> was meekneſſe; and ſo this which giveth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98733:12"/>
to <hi>Iob,</hi> is Patience; and ſo the denomination too of this whole Hiſtory, as if that were the <hi>great leſſon</hi> that were to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, the leſſon of ſuffering and of patience: So that what the Apoſtle makes to be the Uſe of all Scripture, <hi>whatſoever things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were written afore-time were written for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note> 
               <hi>that wee through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> That I ſay which the Apoſtle there makes to be the end and ſcope of the whole Scripture, doth ſeeme to be in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall the principall and chiefe end of writing this Book of <hi>Iob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Inſtruction which we are to take from the whole Book, is this. God would have us learne, that, <hi>afflictions come not by chance, that they are all ordered by providence,</hi> in the matter, in the manner, and the meaſure, both for the kinds and for the degrees, they are all ordered even the very leaſt by the wiſedome, by the hand and providence of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another thing which we are to learne generally from this Book is this, <hi>The Soveraignety of God</hi>; that he hath power over us, over our eſtates, and over our bodies, and over our families, and over our ſpirits: <hi>that he may uſe us as he pleaſeth, and we must be quiet under his hand</hi>; when he commeth and will take all from us, all our comforts, we muſt give all glory to him. This Book is written for this eſpecially, to teach us the <hi>Soveraignty of God, and the ſubmiſſion of the creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It teacheth us, <hi>That God doth ſometimes afflict his children out of prerogative,</hi> that-though there be no ſinne in them which he makes the occaſion of afflicting them, (ſuch was <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe,) yet for exerciſe of his graces in them, for triall of their graces, or to ſet them up for patternes to the world, God may and doth afflict them. <hi>Though no man be without ſinne, yet the afflictions of many are not for their ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. There is this generall Inſtruction which God would have us learne out of this Book, namely that <hi>the best gotten, and the beſt founded eſtate in outward things, is uncertaine</hi>; that there is no truſting to any creature-comforts. God would unbottome us quite from the creature, by holding forth this Hiſtory of <hi>Iob</hi> unto us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. God would alſo ſhew forth this for our learning, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſtrength, the unmoveableneſſe of faith, how unconquerable it is, what a kind of omnipotency there is in grace. God would have all the world take notice of this in the Booke of <hi>Job,</hi> that a godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in vaine aſſaulted by friends or enemies, by men or devils, by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98733:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wants or wounds: Though he be even benighted in his ſpirit, though God himſelfe take away the light of his countenance from him, yet God would have us learne and know, that over all theſe a true beleever is more then a conquerour. For here is one of the greateſt battels fought, that ever was betweene man and man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and hell, yea betweene God and man; yet <hi>Job</hi> went away with the victory, <hi>True Grace is often aſſaulted, it never was or ever ſhall be overthrowne.</hi>

There are theſe two ſpeciall Reaſons, why it

               <p n="1">1.

There is ſcarce any booke in Scripture, that beares date af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that great and wonderfull diſpenſation of God, but it makes mention of or referrs to ſome paſſages concerning them.</p>
               <p>Againe for the time, that which ſome collect to cleare it, is from the Genealogie of <hi>Job,</hi> there are three ſpeciall opinions concerning the line of his pedegree.</p>
               <p>One that he deſcended from <hi>Nahor,</hi> who was brother to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> Gen. 22.21. <hi>It was told</hi> Abraham, <hi>behold</hi> Milcah <hi>ſhee hath borne children to thy brother</hi> Nahor, Uz <hi>his firſt-borne, and</hi> Buz <hi>his brother,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Vz</hi> who was the firſt-borne of <hi>Nahor Abrahams</hi> brother, is conceived to have given denomination to the land of <hi>Vz,</hi> and ſo from him, <hi>Job</hi> to be deſcended.</p>
               <p>Another opinion there is (maintain'd by many) that <hi>Job</hi> was of the line of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and that he was called <hi>Jobab</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Gen. 36.33. <hi>And</hi> Bela <hi>died and</hi> Jobab <hi>the ſon of</hi> Zerah <hi>of</hi> Bozrah <hi>raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his ſtead.</hi> This <hi>Jobab,</hi> who was a deſcendant or one of the Dukes of the line of <hi>Eſau,</hi> they ſay was <hi>Job.</hi> But why the name <hi>Jobab</hi> ſhould be contracted into <hi>Job,</hi> I ſee little reaſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
               <p>A third opinion for his deſcent is, that he came from the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi> by his ſecond wife <hi>Keturah,</hi> Gen. 25. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Abraham</hi> by her had divers ſonnes, and that hee gave them portions and <hi>ſent them Eaſtward into the Eaſt country</hi>; and from <hi>Midian</hi> (who was the fourth ſonne of <hi>Abraham</hi> by that ſecond marriage) our Genealogies doe poſitively and directly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that <hi>Job</hi> was deſcended.</p>

                  <hi>Both low and high, rich and poore together.</hi> The word in the Hebrew for <hi>high,</hi> is <hi>Bene-Iſh,</hi> ſons of <hi>Iſh,</hi> and the word for <hi>low,</hi> is <hi>Bene-Adam,</hi> ſonnes of <hi>Adam.</hi> If we ſhould tranſlate the Text directly, according to the letter, the words muſt runne, <hi>ſonnes of men and ſonnes of men,</hi> for, ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> and ſonnes of <hi>Iſh</hi> are both tranſlated ſonnes of men. Yet when they are ſet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a way of oppoſition, the one ſignifieth <hi>low</hi> and the other <hi>high</hi>; and ſo our Tranſlators render it according to the ſenſe, not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98733:16"/>
ſonnes of men and ſons of men, but <hi>low</hi> and <hi>high. Junius</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to this ſence, though in more words, as well they who are borne of meane men, as they who are borne of the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>A like inſtance we have, Iſa. 2.9. <hi>The meane man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himſelfe.</hi> The meane man, that is, the <hi>ſonne of Adam,</hi> and the great man, the <hi>ſonne of</hi> Iſh; the great man in regard of his excellency, is by ſuch a circumlocution deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to be more then a man: not onely the ſonne of man, but the ſonne of an honourable and great man. So I finde the word divers times uſed to ſignifie the excellency and greatneſſe of the perſon.</p>
               <p>Then further, it ſignifieth not onely a man that is great, but it ſignifieth a <hi>man in authority. There was a man,</hi> that is, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man, a man of worth; <hi>There was a man,</hi> that is, a man in authority. It ſignifies a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and ſo in divers places of Scripture, <hi>Man</hi> is put for a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> eſpecially when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt as here, by <hi>Iſh,</hi> Gen. 43.11. <hi>Carry a preſent to the man, ſcil.</hi> to the Governour of the Countrey, Jer 5.1. <hi>Goe thorough</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>and ſearch, and ſee if you can finde a man.</hi> What were men ſo ſcarce in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at that time?

The meaning then is explained in the words following, <hi>if there be any that executeth iudgement,</hi> that is, if there be a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> a publike man, that's the man I meane.</p>
               <p>So in <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.16. We find the word to ſignifie a <hi>Magiſtrate, Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all fleſh, ſet a man over the Congregation. A man,</hi> that is, a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> for there that's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There was never any ayre ſo bad but that a ſervant of God might breath in it.

                  <hi>It is a great honour and a high commendation to be good and do good amongst thoſe that are evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſhall be recorded for it. This was one reaſon why the place is named, that the honour of <hi>Iob</hi> might be lifted up, that he was good, not by the example and incouragement, but againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others: he was a leading man himſelfe: though he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among thoſe that were ſcoffers and wicked, yet <hi>Iob</hi> was holy.

have no feare of God before their eyes, to be perfect among hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, to be upright among thoſe that are unjuſt, to eſchew evill among thoſe that are altogether wrapt about with evill; This was the honour and commendation of <hi>Iob.</hi> For a man to be as <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodome,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, From the place where <hi>Iob</hi> lived, we may obſerve, That</p>

As all the water in the ſalt Sea cannot make the fiſh ſalt, but ſtill the fiſh retaines its freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo all the wickedneſſe and filthineſſe that is in the world, cannot deſtroy, cannot defile true grace; that will beare up its head and hold up it ſelfe for ever.</p>

               <p>For the clearing of the word, we may conſider there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold perfection aſcrib'd to the Saints in this life. A perfection o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Juſtification, A perfection of Sanctification.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe, in a ſtrict ſenſe, is a compleate perfection: The Saints are compleate in Chriſt, they are perfectly juſtified, there is not any ſinne left uncovered, not any guilt left unwaſhed in the blood of Chriſt, not the leaſt ſpot but is taken away; His gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garment
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98733:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is large enough to cover all our nakedneſſe and deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. In this reſpect they may be called perfect, they are perfectly juſtified, <hi>By one offering Chriſt hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14.</p>
               <p>Then there is a perfection of holineſſe or of ſanctification; and that is called ſo, either in regard of the beginnings of, or in regard of deſires after and aimes at perfection.</p>
               <p>The Saints even in this life have a perfect beginning of holineſſe, becauſe they are begun to be ſanctified in every part; they are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified <hi>throughout, in ſoule and body and ſpirit,</hi> as the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. though every part be not throughout ſanctified, yet they are ſanctified in every part throughout; and this is a perfection. When the worke of ſanctification is begun in all parts, it is a perfect worke beginning.</p>
               <p>They are likewiſe perfect in regard of their deſires and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Perfect holineſſe is the aime of the Saints on earth, it is the reward of the Saints in Heaven. The thing which they drive at here is perfection, therefore they themſelves are called perfect; As God accepts of the will for the deed, ſo he expreſſeth the deed by the will; he interpreteth him to be a perfect man who would be perfect, and calls that perſon perfect, who deſires to have all his imperfections cured. That is a ſecond underſtanding how <hi>Iob</hi> was perfect.</p>
               <p>A third way is this, He was perfect comparatively, comparing him with thoſe who were either openly wicked, or but openly holy, he was a perfect man; he was a man without ſpot, compared with thoſe that were either all over ſpotted with filthineſſe, or only pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>Or thus, We may ſay the perfection here ſpoken of, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſincerity. <hi>Iob</hi> was ſincere, he was <hi>ſound at the heart,</hi> He did not act a part or perſonate Religion, but was a religious perſon. <hi>He was not guilded, but gold.</hi> So the word is interpreted. Some render it, <hi>Iob</hi> was <hi>a ſimple man,</hi> (not as ſimple is put for weake and fooliſh, but as ſimple is put for <hi>plaine hearted</hi>; one that is not (as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> phraſeth it) <hi>a double minded man) Iob</hi> was <hi>a ſimple minded man,</hi> or <hi>a ſingle minded man,</hi> one that had not <hi>a heart</hi> and <hi>a heart,</hi> he was not a compound, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one thing and meaning another, he meant what he ſpake, and he would ſpeake his mind. It is the ſame word that is uſed in <hi>Iacobs</hi> character, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.27. Eſau <hi>was a cunning hunter, a man

of the field, and</hi> Jacob <hi>was</hi> Iſh Tam, <hi>a plaine man,</hi> So that to be a perfect man, is to be a plaine man, one whoſe heart you may know by his tongue, and reade the mans ſpirit in his actions. Some are <hi>ſuch juglers,</hi> that you can ſee little of their ſpirits in their lives, you can learne but little of their minds by their words; <hi>Iacob</hi> was a plaine man and ſo was <hi>Iob</hi>; ſome tranſlate it a ſound man. It is the ſame expreſſion that is given of <hi>Noah,</hi> He was <hi>[Tamim] in his generation,</hi> or he was ſound, upright hearted or perfect with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. And it is that which God ſpeakes to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.2. <hi>Walke before me and be thou</hi> [Tamim,] <hi>be thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or ſound, or upright, or plaine in thy walking before me.</hi> In the 28. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> v. 30. We reade of the <hi>Vrim</hi> and the <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> on the Breaſt-plate of the High-prieſt. <hi>Thummim</hi> comes from this roote, and ſignified the <hi>integrity of heart</hi> and life required in the High-prieſt, as <hi>Vrim</hi> did the light and cleareneſſe of his knowledge.</p>

                  <hi>And upright.</hi>] The former word which was tranſlated <hi>perfect,</hi> in other Texts is rendered <hi>upright</hi>; But when we have both the expreſſions together as here, we muſt diſtinguiſh the ſenſe. It is not a tautologie. Then, the former being taken for inward ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, plaineneſſe and ſincerity; This latter (to be upright) may be taken for outward juſtice, righteouſneſſe and equity, reſpecting all his dealings in the world. He was a perfect man, that is, he was plaine hearted, and he was plaine dealing too, which is the meaning of, <hi>He was upright</hi>; So the one referres to the integrity of his ſpirit, the other to the honeſty of his wayes, <hi>His heart was plaine, and his dealings were ſquare.</hi> This he expreſſeth fully in the 29. and 31. <hi>Chapters</hi> of this Booke, which are as it were a Comment upon this word <hi>upright.</hi> There you may reade what is meant by uprightneſſe; his faireneſſe in all parts, both of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative and Diſtributive Juſtice. In thoſe things that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Commutative Juſtice, when <hi>Iob</hi> bought or ſould, traded or bargained, promiſed or covenanted, hee ſtood to all uprightly. Take him as he was a Magiſtrate, when <hi>Iob</hi> ſate in Judgement or had any buſineſſe brought before him, he gave every one his due, he did not ſpare or ſmite upon ends; he did neither at any time juſtifie the wicked or condemne the godly, but was upright in Judgement: He was not byaſt by affection or intereſts, he was not carried away by hopes or feares, but kept the path of Juſtice in all his diſpenſations towards that people among whom he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

This is to be an upright man, and ſo the Prophet tells us, Iſa, 26.7. <hi>The way of the Iuſt is uprightneſſe,</hi> that is, they are upright in their wayes, and more, uprightneſſe in the abſtract. We have a like expreſſion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.27. <hi>Thoſe that are upright in the way are an abomination to the wicked.</hi> Uprightneſſe doth referre to the way wherein a man goes in his outward dealings and diſpenſations towards men. There is a two-fold upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our wayes. 1. Uprightneſſe of words. 2. Of works; ſo upright walking is expounded and branched forth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.2, 3. <hi>He that walketh uprightly and worketh righteouſneſſe and ſpeaketh the truth in his heart. He that back-biteth not with his tongue.</hi> This is the ſecond part of <hi>Iobs</hi> deſcription; <hi>He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and upright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, He was <hi>One that feared God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fearing God</hi>] The feare of God is taken two wayes. Either for that naturall and inward worſhip of God: and ſo <hi>the feare</hi> of God is a holy filiall affection, awing the whole man to obey <hi>the whole will of God:</hi> That is feare as it is an affection. Or the feare of God is put for the externall or inſtituted worſhip of God. So that a man fearing God is as much as this: A man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God according to his owne will, or according to his mind and direction. Now when as <hi>Iob</hi> is ſaid to be a man fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, you muſt take it both theſe wayes; He had that holy affection of feare with which we muſt worſhip God, (as we are taught, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Let us have grace whereby wee may ſerve God with reverence and godly feare; And ſerve the Lord with feare and rejoyce before him with trembling,</hi> Pſal. 2. Feare is that affection with which we muſt worſhip and ſerve God.) And <hi>Iob</hi> likewiſe did performe that worſhip to God which he required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is called Feare, and the exerciſe of it fearing God. Fearing God is worſhipping God; As you may ſee clearely by two Texts of Scripture compared together. In the fourth of <hi>Math.</hi> v. 10. Chriſt ſaith to the Devill, <hi>It is written thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only thou ſhalt ſerve</hi>; Compare this with <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. and there you ſhall have it thus expreſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God</hi>; That which in the one place is worſhip, in the other is feare. Againe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>In vaine</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>doe they worſhip mee, teaching for doctrine the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of men.</hi> Now the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (from whence that is taken) <hi>Chapt.</hi> 29.14. expreſſeth it thus. <hi>Foraſmuch as their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98733:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
feare toward mee is taught by the precepts of men.</hi> They worſhip me according to the precepts of men, <hi>ſaith Chriſt.</hi> Their feare is taught by the precepts of men, <hi>ſaith the Prophet:</hi> So that feare and worſhip are the ſame: Fearing God doth include both the affection of a worſhipper, and the duty or act of worſhipping.</p>
               <p>The fourth part or line of <hi>Iobs</hi> character, is, his Eſchewing evill.</p>
               <p>Evill is here taken for the evill of ſinne, before ſinne came into the world, there was no evill in the world, <hi>God ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good.</hi> But when ſinne came which was the firſt and is the chiefeſt evill, it brought in with it all other evills: Sinne hath in it the whole nature of evill, and all the degrees of evill, and from it proceed all evill effects. Hence is eminently called evill. Sickneſſe, and death, and Hell are called evill; how much rather that, but for which theſe evills had never bin? how much rather that with which theſe compared may be called good? Further, evill is put here inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, He was one that eſchewed evill, not this or that evill, but evill, that is all evill, this indefinite is univerſall. And then further we are to take evill here, as himſelfe afterward expo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nds it in his practiſe, not only for the acts of evill, but all the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the appearances, the provocations and incentives of or unto evill, for whatſoever might leade him into evill; for thus he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in one particular, <hi>I made a covenant with mine eyes, why then ſhould I thinke upon a maide?</hi> Chap. 31.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſchewed.</hi>] In this word, the prudence of <hi>Iob</hi> ſhines as bright as his holineſſe, who having received a great <hi>ſtock and treaſure of grace,</hi> now watches to preſerve it, and oppoſes whatſoever was deſtructive to the life or growth of the inner man. That man ſhewes he hath both money and his wits about him, who ſuſpects and provides againſt Theeves.</p>
               <p>Job <hi>eſchewed evill.</hi> There is much in that expreſſion. It is more to ſay a man doth <hi>eſchew evill,</hi> then to ſay a man doth not <hi>commit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi> It had bin too bare an expreſſion, to ſay, <hi>Iob</hi> did not commit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, but when it is ſaid Job <hi>eſchewed evill,</hi> this ſhews, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hand and tongue of <hi>Iob</hi> did not medle with evill, but that his heart was turned from evill. For eſchewing is a turning aſide with reluctancy and abhorrency, ſo the Hebrew <hi>(Sar)</hi> imports; <hi>Iob</hi> did abhorre evill as well as not commit evill. As there is a great deale of difference betweene theſe two, the doing of good, and a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98733:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
delight in doing good, betweene being at peace and following of peace. A man may doe good and not be a lover of good, a lover of the Commandements of God, a delighter in them: he may be at peace and not be a lover and follower of peace. So a man may be one that commits not ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, he may doe no hurt, and yet in the meane time he may be one that loves thoſe ſinnes, he commits not: Such an one is not preſently a man that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewes thoſe ſinnes, for to eſchew evill noteth the activity of the ſpirit againſt thoſe evils. That is the ſpiritualneſſe and ſtrength of holineſſe. <hi>Iobs</hi> heart did (as it were) riſe againſt evill. Some expound it by warre, as if under this expreſſion were meant the enmity that <hi>Iob</hi> bare againſt evill, that it was ſuch an eſchewing, as when a man hateth his enemy and makes warre againſt him, and doth by all meanes oppoſe him; ſo there was as it were a deadly feud, an irreconciliable emnity betweene <hi>Job</hi> and evill. <hi>He was a man that feared God and eſchewed evill.</hi> So much for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of that firſt verſe: wherein you have the firſt part of the deſcription of <hi>Iobs</hi> proſperous eſtate, and that is what he was in his perſon.</p>
               <q>That man was perfect and upright.</q>
               <p>We will obſerve hence ſomewhat in the generall firſt, and then ſomewhat more particularly.</p>
               <p>You ſee here when God comes to deſcribe a man and to ſet him forth in his glory and excellency, where the Spirit of God begins, what is the chiefe and firſt thing which God takes notice of, it is his grace. When he would ſet forth what a man <hi>Iob</hi> was, how bleſſed and how happy, here he ſets his pen firſt, to deſcribe what his ſpirituall eſtate was. Hence then this in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Gracious habits and ſpirituall bleſſings are the choyſeſt of all bleſſings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If God have given a man grace, he hath the beſt and the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of all that which God can give. God hath given us his Sonne, and God hath given us his Spirit, and God hath given us the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Spirit, theſe are the fineſt of the flowre, and the honey out of the rocke of mercy. Though you ſhould not come to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though you ſhould not come to the other part of the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to Sheepe and Camels and Oxen and Aſſes; if you are in the firſt part of the deſcription, that you have a perfect heart and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

life, and the feare of God in your inward parts, and a holy turning againſt every evill, your lot is fallen in a faire place, and you have a goodly heritage: they that have this need not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at their owne, or envious at the condition of any other, they have the principall Verbe, the one thing neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Againe, When God deſcribeth a gracious man, you ſee he goes thorough, he ſets him forth in every thing that concernes his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eſtate, <hi>Perfect and upright, fearing God and eſchewing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi> From hence this alſo in the generall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Where one grace is there is every grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Grace is laid into the ſoule in all the parts of it, and there is ſomewhat of every grace layed into the ſoule. We have not one man, one grace, and another man another grace, but every man hath every grace that hath any grace at all. I doe not ſay that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man hath every grace: or that the ſame man hath every grace in the ſame height and degree: grace in ſome is more eminent than in others, and the ſame man may have one grace more eminent than another, he may have one grace (like <hi>Saul</hi> among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) higher by head and ſhoulders then the reſt in his throng of graces; yet that man hath ſomewhat of every grace that hath any grace, all grace goes together. Thus in the generall.</p>
               <p>Particularly: This man was <hi>perfect.</hi> That is (as wee have explained it) hee was ſincere and plaine hearted. Obſervation hence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is ſincerity that eſpecially commends us unto God.</hi> As <hi>Iobs</hi> graces are prefer'd in his deſcription before his riches; ſo ſincerity is prefer'd before all his other graces.</p>
               <p>Sincerity is that which makes us ſo acceptable and pleaſing unto God: He was a man that was perfect, you ſee that is put in the firſt place.

                  <hi>The feare of the Lord is cleane,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 19. Cleane not onely in it ſelfe, formally cleane, but <hi>effective,</hi> it makes clean and keepes cleane the heart and life. Feare is as an armed man at the gate, which examines all, and ſtoppes every one from entring, that is unfit. It ſtands as a Watch-man on the Tower, and it lookes every way to ſee what's comming to the ſoule; If evill come, feare will not admit it. And therefore in Scripture you ſhall have theſe two often put together, <hi>fearing God and eſchewing evill.</hi> Nay eſchewing evill is not onely put as an effect of the feare of God, but it is put into the very definition it ſelfe of the feare of God, <hi>The feare of the Lord is to depart from evill.</hi>

What our Saviour Chriſt ſaith of a mans ſoule, may be ſaid of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;<note place="margin">Mat. 16.26.</note> 
                  <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoule?</hi> It is true, that is ſpoken there of a mans owne ſoule, that it is more to himſelfe than the world, but it is a truth here too, if one have a ſoule given him (and to have a child is to have a ſoule beſtow'd on us) for the preſent it is more than to have the whole world beſtowed on him. A whole world of riches is not ſo good, not ſuch goods, as one child: therefore children are put in the firſt place, as his choiſeſt and chiefeſt outward bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Then from the number of his children, he had many children, he had 7. ſons and 3. daughters. Obſerve,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To have many children is a great bleſſing, and the more children the greater the bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some thinke themſelves bleſſed, if they may have one or two children; one to inherit their eſtates, one or two to delight themſelves in, to play with, or to beare their name; but if they come to a number, to a great number, then they thinke themſelves exceedingly burthen'd, then they are troubles. When God caſts up the eſtate of a bleſſed man in outward things, he ſaith not onely
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98733:23"/>
that he hath a child, that he is not barren, but that he hath many children, that he hath his quiver full of ſuch arrowes, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.5. and that is made the bleſſedneſſe of a man there. <hi>Happy is the man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that hath his quiver full of them,</hi> that hath many ſuch arrowes, ſuch are children of the youth, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. There are ſome rich and covetous men, that are in this point beyond others rich in folly. You ſhall heare them pride themſelves, that they have no children, or but few; this they conceive ſets them off in the opinion of the world for the richer men, whereas one child is more riches then all the things that are in the world. And we know it is an ordinary thing (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a very ſinfull thing) to ſay, 'tis true ſuch an one is a rich man, he hath a faire eſtate, but he hath a great charge, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children, as if that did take-off from his riches, or make him leſſe happy: as if he were the poorer, becauſe he hath a larger ſhare of that ancient firſt bleſſing upon man,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Be fruitfull and multiply and repleniſh the Earth.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Note this, <hi>To have many ſons, to have moſt ſons amongſt our children, is the greater outward bleſſing.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Iob</hi> is deſcribed here in the moſt exact method of outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; he had ſonnes, and his ſonnes out-number his daughters, he had 7. ſonnes and but three daughters. And the reaſon why moſt ſonnes among children are the greater bleſſing, is cleare, becauſe ſonnes beare up the name, and are a greater ſupport unto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>To have many ſonnes and daughters too, is yet a compleater bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For by daughters the family is increaſt, and other families are joyned and knit and united to that family. And to have ſons and daughters both, is the perfection of that naturall bleſſing; becauſe man was ſo made at the firſt, he was made male and female. As it is with the ſoule and the body, though the ſoule be more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than the body, yet the ſoule alone is not ſo perfect, as when ſoule and body are together: becauſe though the body be not ſo ſtrong in conſtitution and noble in condition as the ſoule, yet body and ſoule in creation were joyned together, therefore their greateſt perfection conſiſts in their union. So likewiſe it is in a family, though ſonnes in nature are more perfect, yet becauſe it was the firſt inſtitution of a family, male and female, therefore the fullnes and compleatneſſe of the bleſſing is in the union of both. <hi>Iob</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98733:24"/>
had many ſons and daughters likewiſe, this made the bleſſing more compleat.</p>
               <p>And then laſtly obſerve this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Children, many children in the family are in themſelves no impediments, either of piety towards God or iustice toward man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoone as ever <hi>Iob</hi> was deſcribed in all his perfections, it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he had ſo many ſonnes and ſo many daughters, though he had ſo many children to looke to, and provide for, yet he omitted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duty toward God, nor duty toward man. There are many who thinke it ſome excuſe, if not excuſe enough for their neglect, for their ſleighting holy duties, or ſleightneſſe in the holy duties of hearing, praying and the like; oh, they have a great many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they muſt riſe early and they muſt worke late, they can ſpare no time or but little for the publike or private or ſecret wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; ſpecially for any thing that is extraordinary: ſo that theſe cares ſteale away, not onely thoſe times that might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in an extraordinary manner upon their ſoules, but even the ordinary times are ſtolen away by them alſo. Further, ſome thinke themſelves by this in part excuſed for their injuſtice toward men, they have a great family, and if they deale ſomewhat hardly, and ſticke as cloſe as they can in all buſineſſes, they may be borne with, for they have a great many children; and they muſt looke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them, they elſe were <hi>worſe then Infidels,</hi> and hence they take liberty to doe what honeſt Infidels were aſham'd of. <hi>Iob</hi> you ſee was upright, though he had ſo many ſonnes and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daughters to provide for. It is ill with thoſe whoſe gaine for their children is any loſſe to their ſouls; but woe, when any to gaine for their children looſe their ſouls: doing like thoſe in <hi>Na.</hi> 2.12. <hi>The Lyon did teare in peeces enough for his whelpes, and ſtrangled for his lioneſſes, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine.</hi> By the <hi>Lyon</hi> there is meant thoſe <hi>oppreſſours,</hi> that lived in <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and by their whelpes are meant their children, and by Lioneſſes their wives; they had wives and children, and they muſt have meanes and eſtates for them. <hi>Iob</hi> as I may ſay had whelpes and a lioneſſe, wife and children, yet he doth not teare for them. Nay though hee had ſo many to provide for, yet hee rather giveth out to others. What hungry belly was not filled with his meat? And what naked backe was not cloathed with his wooll? He did not ſay I have children to feed and to cloath, and therefore you can
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98733:24"/>
have nothing. You ſee though he had many children and a great charge, yet how compleate he was in his duty to God and in his duty to man, he failed not either in the duties of worſhip and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, nor in the duties of juſtice and uprightneſſe.</p>

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98733:25"/>We find frequent mention in thoſe ancient times, of the riches of the Patriarcks and others in gold and ſilver. It is expreſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 13.2. <hi>That</hi> Abraham <hi>was very rich in cattell, in ſilver and in gold.</hi> And <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.35. ſaith of him, <hi>The Lord hath bleſſed my Master greatly, and he hath given him flocks, and heards, and ſilver, and gold</hi>; And verſe 53. <hi>The ſervant brought forth Iewels of ſilver, and Iewels of gold, and gave them to</hi> Rebeckah, <hi>he gave alſo to her brother and to her mother precious things</hi>; And <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.16. we reade of <hi>Abrahams</hi> paying <hi>foure hundred ſhekels of ſilver unto</hi> Ephron <hi>the Hittite,</hi> which was called <hi>currant money with the Merchants.</hi> So that it is plaine, in thoſe dayes, gold and ſilver, and Jewels were ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>But here the Eſtate of <hi>Iob</hi> is reckoned and caſt up by Cattell, there is no mention of gold, and ſilver, and Jewels, and precious ſtones, and the like. <hi>His ſubſtance was</hi> 7000. <hi>Sheepe,</hi> &amp;c. Two reaſons may be given for this accompt.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, Becauſe thoſe ancient times were ſo much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to and imployed in the feeding of Cattell: therefore they did reckon their eſtates by Cattell, as we now doe by Money, by gold and by ſilver, or by yearely rents and revenues: If a man had ſo many Cattell, ſo many Sheepe, ſo many Oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they knew his Eſtate, what gold and ſilver or other riches he might have. When the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> came before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Gen. 46.32. they are called Shepheards, <hi>The men are Shepheards,</hi>

                  <hi>for their trade hath beene to feede Cattell</hi>; They are men of Cattell, as if he ſhould ſay, the ſpeciall commodity, the maine thing theſe trade in, is about Cattell, and that gives the denomination: They had gold and ſilver, but they are <hi>men of Cattell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then againe, for this reaſon, Cattell are living ſubſtance; Gold and ſilver are dead ſubſtance. Cattell in their owne nature are more excellent then gold and ſilver, becauſe they have life; Every thing that hath life is better in its degree then that which hath no life: The loweſt creature that hath life is better then the beſt without life; the loweſt of a ſuperiour order, is better then the higheſt of an inferiour; Now all things without life are put into a degree, into a Claſſis or forme below and inferiour to thoſe that have life. It is true, <hi>that Money anſwereth all things,</hi>

Hence it was that the <hi>Antients</hi> gave the name <hi>Pecunia</hi> to Money, which comes <hi>a Pecude,</hi> from Cattell (ſo the Criticks obſerve) becauſe they ſtamp'd the forme of a Sheepe or an Oxe upon Money, noting that Cattell were the riches and the eſtate of a man properly and chiefely. This may ſuffice for the reaſons why the eſtate or riches of <hi>Iob</hi> is ſet forth by Cattell, and not by gold and ſilver and other like poſſeſſions.</p>

He was the greateſt man in outward eſtate of all the men of the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of all the men of the Eaſt.</hi> Heb: Sonnes of the Eaſt. In the 25. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> v.6. Abraham <hi>gave gifts unto his Sonnes by the Concubines, and ſent them away from his Sonne</hi> Iſaac <hi>Eastward into the East Countrey.</hi> Doubtleſſe the bleſſing of God follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Sonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> his friend, and they waxed Great, but among them all <hi>Iob was greatest.</hi> It had bin much to ſay, he was a great man amongſt the men of the Eaſt: for the men of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> were very great men, and very rich men. As to ſay, one is a rich man in the City of <hi>London</hi> where there are ſo many rich men; one that goeth for a rich man there, is a rich man indeed. But here is more in this, he was not only a rich man, or a great man amongſt the men of the Eaſt, but he was the greateſt, he was the richeſt of them: as to ſay, that one is the richeſt in the whole City, cryes a man up to the height of riches: this expreſſion then heightens the ſence of the Text concerning <hi>Iobs</hi> greatneſſe, he was not only great among the men of the <hi>East,</hi> but the greateſt man of them; as if the Holy Ghoſt ſhould have ſaid, I will not ſtay reckoning up particulars or telling you this and that <hi>Iob</hi> had: you know the Eaſt was a large Countrey and full of rich men, his eſtate was the largeſt, and himſelfe the richeſt of all the men of the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>A Queſtion may here be raiſed, Why the Holy Ghoſt ſpends ſo many words, and is thus accurate in the ſetting forth of <hi>Iobs</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate.</p>
               <p>I ſhall touch three reaſons for it:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is deſcribed to be a man of a very <hi>great estate,</hi> to the end that the greatneſſe of his aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iction might appeare afterward: the meaſure of a loſſe is taken by the greatneſſe of a mans enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If a man have but little, his affliction cannot be great: but if a man have much, if he have abundance, then the affliction doth abound. After great enjoyments, want is greateſt: Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe preſſes thoſe moſt, who once were full. <hi>I went out full</hi> (ſaith <hi>Naomi,</hi> Ruth. 1.21.) <hi>and the Lord hath brought me home empty, therefore call me not</hi> Naomi <hi>(which is pleaſant,) but</hi> Marah <hi>which is bitter, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The greatneſſe of his estate</hi> is ſet forth, that the greatneſſe of his patience might appeare: For a man to be made poorer, that was but poore and meane before, it is no great matter though he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98733:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beare it;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Scimus quia majorem dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent damna majora,</hi> Greg.</note> for a man to have but little that never had much, is no great tryall of his patience: but for a man to have nothing at all, that had as it were all things, and to be patient under it, this ſhewes the proofe of patience. To a man that is borne a ſlave, or a captive, captivity and bondage is no trouble: it doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exerciſe his patience, he is ſcarce ſenſible of the evill, becauſe he never knew better.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Multo facilius eſt non habita repudiare, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſeſſa amit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere,</hi> Aug.</note> But for a King that is borne free and hath power over others, for a King that is in the height of freedome and liberty to become a ſlave and a captive, in ſuch a one patience hath a perfect worke, if he beare it. So for <hi>Iob,</hi> a man that once abounded in all manner of outward good things, to be outed and emptyed of all, that tryed his patience to the full.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was to give to all the world, a teſtimony that Job <hi>was a through godly and holy man</hi>; that he was a man of extraordinary ſtrength of grace; why? becauſe he held his integrity, and kept up his ſpirit in the way of holineſſe, notwithſtanding he was lifted up with abundance of outward bleſſings. To be very great and very good, ſhewes that a man is good indeed: <hi>Great and good, Rich and holy, are happy conjunctions, and they are rare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions.</hi> Uſually riches impoveriſh the ſoule, and the world cares out all care of Heaven; therefore <hi>Iob</hi> was one of a thouſand, being at once thus great in riches and thus rich in goodneſſe. He was <hi>rich in grace,</hi> that was ſo gracious in the middeſt of ſo much riches,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exingentibus</hi> Jobi <hi>divitijs valde locuple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur ejus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitas,</hi> Pined. <hi>in loc.</hi> Deut 3.2.</note> the godlineſſe of <hi>Iob</hi> was inriched by his riches: It argued that <hi>Iobs</hi> godlineſſe was very great and very right, becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued right in the middeſt of all his greatneſſe. How often doe riches cauſe forgetfulneſſe of God, yea kicking againſt God? How often are they made the bellowes of pride, the fewell of uncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the inſtruments of revenge? How often doe rich men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, diſpiſe and oppreſſe their weake and poore bretheren? but to make riches the fewell of our Graces, and the Inſtruments of duty both to God and man: To have the houſe full of riches, and the heart full of holineſſe, theſe united are admirable. <hi>Extremes are very dangerous:</hi> to be extreame poore or extreame rich, is an extreame temptation. Therefore the wiſe man <hi>Agur</hi>; Prov. 30.8. prayes, <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches, Lord</hi> ſaith he, I would not be in any of the extreames: It is a ſore temptation to be farre on either hand, to be farre on the hand of riches, or farre on the hand of poverty. To be very poore and very holy, is a rare thing; That man hath great treaſures and riches of grace
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98733:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who is ſo. I remember the ſpeech of a poore woman, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a child about 8. or 9. yeares of age, and being once in ſuch a ſtreight that hunger began to pinch them both, the child looking upon the Mother ſaid, <hi>Mother, doe you thinke that God will starve us? No child anſwers the Mother.</hi> The child replyed <hi>if he doe, yet we must love him and ſerve him.</hi> Such language from the heart, becomes and argues more then a Child in Grace, a <hi>growne Christian. They are fil'd with Chriſt who can ſtarve and ſerve him. So likewiſe are they who being full fed yet ſerve him</hi>; and temptations are greater upon the full then upon the empty, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rich then upon the poore: The reaſon of it is, becauſe as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doe ſtirre up luſt, ſo they give fewel, and adminiſter inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the obtaining and taking in of that which luſt calls for: this poverty doth not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The poore,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>receive the Goſpell; the lame and the blind make most ſpeed, and ſee their way clearest into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven</hi>;<note place="margin">Mat. 19.24.</note> but for rich men (he ſaith) <hi>It is eaſier for a Camel to goe through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> We ſee now the Miracle acted in <hi>Iob,</hi> the Camel is got thorough the needles eye: <hi>Job</hi> a rich man is got through the needles eye with three thouſand Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the reaſon was, becauſe all his Camels, Cattell and riches, did not take up ſo much roome in his heart, they were not ſo thick in his ſpirit, as one ſingle thred. <hi>All his outward eſtate was kept without,</hi> not a ſhred, not a thread got into his ſpirit. Take this for a third reaſon, why the Holy Ghoſt doth thus exactly ſet forth the eſtate of <hi>Iob,</hi> .ſc. that he might appeare to be an exact holy man.</p>
               <p>From the whole take theſe Obſervations:</p>
               <p>Firſt, We ſee here <hi>Job</hi> a holy man very full of riches; Then Obſerve, <hi>That riches are the good bleſſings of God.</hi> God would never have beſtowed them upon his <hi>Job</hi> elſe. Leaſt we ſhould thinke riches <hi>evill,</hi> they are given to thoſe who are good:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Divitiae, ne malae putentur dantur bonis, ne magnae vel ſummae dantur &amp; malis,</hi> Aug.</note> And leaſt riches ſhould be thought the <hi>chiefest good,</hi> they are given to thoſe that are evill. <hi>It is a certaine truth, that God never gives any thing in it ſelfe evill to thoſe that are good; nor doth he ever give the chiefest good to thoſe that are evill.</hi> Therefore it ſhewes, that riches are good, becauſe the godly have them; and it ſhewes that they are not the chiefeſt good, becauſe the wicked have them. When the Goſpell calls us to renounce the world, to caſt off the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98733:28"/>
world; it calls us to caſt the world out of our affections, not out of our poſſeſſion. To hold and poſſeſſe great riches is not evill, it is evill to ſet our hearts upon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Iob</hi> was deſcribed before, A juſt man, an upright man, that is, a man juſt in his dealing, a man that gave every one his owne; He did not decline, no not a haires bredth (if poſſibly he could) from the line of Juſtice, Commutative or Diſtributive; yet this <hi>Iob</hi> is exceeding rich. Hence obſerve, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plaine and honeſt dealing is no hinderance to the gaining or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of an estate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Honeſt dealing is no ſtop, no barre to getting. There is a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Proverbe amongſt us, which ſome uſe, and it is to be feared, ſome walke by it, <hi>That he which uſeth plaine dealing ſhall die a Beggar.</hi> You ſee <hi>Job,</hi> that was a plaine man, a juſt dealing man, yet is full of riches; the nigheſt and the ſafeſt way to riches, is the way of juſtice. Woe to thoſe who by getting riches, get a wound in their owne conſciences. What will it advantage any one to gather many goods, when in the meane time his heart tells him, that all have a <hi>bad Master?</hi> What will it advantage any to load, to fraight his Ship by trading on forbidden Coaſts, when by doing this he ſplits and makes ſhipwracke of his ſoul. If you would goe the ready way to attaine the things of this life, walke in the wayes of God. Honeſty and Juſtice, Uprightneſſe and truth will leade you to the higheſt and greateſt eſtate, with Gods bleſſing. All other riches are poverty, all other gaine is loſſe; There is a fire in an eſtate ill gotten, which will at laſt conſume it. A man builds with timber that hath a fire in it, that layes the foundation of his eſtate by ſinne, <hi>he layes up iniquity for his children.</hi> And ſo doth God, <hi>Job</hi> 21.19.</p>
               <p>It is commonly ſaid likewiſe, <hi>Dives aut iniquus aut iniqui hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. A rich man is either an unjuſt man, or the heyre of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt man.</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. the wicked are put for the rich, <hi>How long will you iudge uniuſtly and accept the perſons of the wicked?</hi> That is, the perſons, <hi>(Divitum aut Potentum)</hi> of rich or great men; ſo it is to be underſtood; for Judges would never accept the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of wicked men, if they were poore, if they be in equall bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with others, in regard of outward things: and then the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that is made in the next words, <hi>Defend the poore and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe</hi>; ſhewes that the rich are there meant. Theſe <hi>great ones</hi> are called wicked, becauſe (ſaith the Gloſſe) they uſually get and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98733:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
uphold their greatneſſe by wickedneſſe. Such is the courſe of the world, and it is the ſhame of the world, much more of Chriſtians. We ſee in <hi>Jobs</hi> practiſe that riches may be attained and maintained too by righteouſneſſe, Job <hi>was rich and iuſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In that <hi>Iob,</hi> a man fearing God, was thus rich, thus great. See here the <hi>truth of the promiſes.</hi> God will make good his <hi>promiſe</hi> concerning outward things to his people.<note place="margin">1 Tim 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe hath the promiſes of this life, as well as of that which is to come.</hi> As it hath promiſes made to it, ſo it hath promiſes perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to it; <hi>Iob</hi> a man fearing God, a godly man, is very rich. Indeed, <hi>not many rich, not many mighty, not many honourable, not many great ones are called:</hi> and ſo not many of thoſe that are called,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26.</note> are mighty, and rich, and great and noble: yet ſome ſuch are, that the truth of the promiſes may appeare ſomtime in the very letter to the eye of ſence, as it alwayes doth to the eye of faith.</p>
               <p>Doe not feare that you ſhall be poore, if you turne godly, for godlineſſe hath the promiſes of this life; and there was a rich <hi>Iob,</hi> a rich <hi>Abraham,</hi> a rich <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a rich <hi>David,</hi> and many other godly, rich. God will performe when it is good for them, the promiſes of outward good things to his children outwardly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Here is another Obſervation from this place; <hi>Iob</hi> was frequent in holy duties; he was a man fearing God, that is (as we explained it in the firſt verſe) he was much verſt in the wayes of holy worſhip, he did not ſerve God by fits or at his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but <hi>continually,</hi> yet he was very rich. Note hence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Time spent in holy duties, is no loſſe, no hinderance to our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary callings, or to our thriving in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iob</hi> ſerves God ſo frequently, that it is called continually, yet he grows in wealth abundantly. The time that he ſpent in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God did not rob his purſe, impoveriſh his family, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in his dealings and buſineſſes of the world; <hi>Iob</hi> maintained both his callings, he maintained his generall calling in the wayes and ſervice of God: and his ſpeciall or particular calling in his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto men, both went on together, and they were no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance one to another, but a furtherance rather. The time we ſpend in ſpirituall duties, is time gain'd for ſecular. The paines we take in prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whets our tools and oyls our wheels, promotes all we go about and getteth a bleſſing upon all.</p>
               <p>This meets with another blaſphemy, very frequent in the world. If a man profeſſing godlineſſe goe backward in his eſtate, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98733:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a man that is taken notice of for his extraordinary zeale and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in holy duties: Then the clamour is, O you ſee what hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Sermons hath brought him unto, you ſee what comes of his praying and faſting, he ha's followed theſe things you ſee, till he is undone. I ſay two things unto theſe men.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Many are thought to goe backward in their outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, becauſe they doe ſo much in ſpirituall duties, when indeed they are ſo farre from doing too much that they doe too little, and that rather is the reaſon why they thrive not. The body may be exercis'd often, when the ſpirit workes but ſeldome, if at all in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things; and this indeed provokes God many times to blaſt an outward eſtate. It is a common fault, that when we ſee thoſe whom we conceive godly faling in outward things, wee are taken up onely in finding out anſwers how to acquit the juſtice of God in his promiſes. What ſhall we ſay to ſuch a promiſe, <hi>Seeke firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſnes, and all theſe things ſhal be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto you?</hi> We trouble our ſelves often to ſatisfie the point in reference to the juſtice of God and the truth of his promiſe. We ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſuſpect whether or how they have performed the condition of the promiſe. We ſhould rather doubt that they have not evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellically performed the condition, then trouble our ſelves ſo much with ſeeking how to ſatisfie the juſtice of God in anſwering the ingagement and promiſe on his part. For without all queſtion, they that doe ſeeke according to the tenour of that condition, God will adminiſter all things unto them.</p>
               <p>Or ſecondly, we ſhould ſay thus rather, that they who are ſo much exerciſed in wayes of communion with God, have ſurely gain'd a great ſpirituall eſtate. And that now God brings them to the proofe of it by loſſes in their temporall eſtates. Theſe or the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations we ought to make, if we ſee them going backward in outward things, who have beene very forward in ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning <hi>Iobs</hi> outward eſtate, in regard of his riches, both what they were in the kind, and in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>In the next place his outward happineſſe is deſcribed by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and concord of his children.</p>

               <p>This verſe ſets forth the third part of <hi>Iobs</hi> happineſſe in reſpect of his outward eſtate. He had children, and many children in the ſecond verſe: Here in the fourth we find all theſe children, ſonnes and daughters agreeing and feaſting one with another. We may note from the words foure things concerning this Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their <hi>alacrity</hi> and <hi>chearefullneſſe,</hi> which moſt doe obſerve out of that expreſſion, <hi>they went and feaſted,</hi> which phraſe in the Hebrew ſignifies the doing of a thing with chearfulnes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their <hi>unanimity:</hi> It is not ſaid that ſome two or three of his ſons feaſted, but his ſons indefinitely, all his ſons: and not onely his ſons, but his daughters, the three ſiſters were called too. So that they were all of one mind, they all met together in love, though they were ten in number, they were but one in heart, the ſame in ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The place</hi> where they feaſted, <hi>it was in their houſes,</hi> they did not goe to ſuſpected places, but in their owne private houſes and families, where it was moſt convenient, and where they might celebrate thoſe meetings with moſt ſecurity, both for their bodies and for their ſoules.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The frequency of that feaſting,</hi> it was not onely once, but <hi>every one his day.</hi> They did meet at every one of their houſes upon a ſpeciall and a ſet day. <hi>Every one his day,</hi> ſome make the ſence thus, <hi>they feaſted in their houſes one every day,</hi> as if it had been a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall feaſt with them, they feaſted all the weeke long; and they would ſeeme to allow it by the moderation uſed in their feaſting: out the words every one his day, note a courſe, a certaine time wherein they did feaſt, not a continued feaſting. Some conceive it was upon their <hi>birth-dayes:</hi> whether that be ſo or no there is nothing appeares from the Text, only it is ſaid, <hi>They feasted every one his day.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And they ſent and called for their three ſiſters to eat and to drinke with them.</q>
               <p>In that we may obſerve 3. things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The humanity of the brethren,</hi> they would not banquet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98733:30"/>
and leave out their ſiſters, but they ſent and called them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The modesty of the Sisters,</hi> that they would not come but upon ſpeciall invitation, they were not forward of themſelves, but they were ſent and called for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>end of this invitation,</hi> it was <hi>to eat and to drinke with them.</hi> As under the notions of bread and water, or bread and wine, all neceſſaries for food are compriſed; ſo under the actions of eating and drinking, the whole buſineſſe of feaſting is contained, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.15. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.24.</p>
               <p>There is nothing further in the words, that we need ſtay longer in opening or clearing of them. We ſhall onely give you ſome few notes out of them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It is lawfull to uſe feaſting.</hi>
               </p>

                  </note> and it is a cleare argument that ſuch uſing of the creatures in feaſting, is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe God hath made more creatures, ſerving for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of man, than he hath made for the neceſſity of man. If God had meant that men ſhould doe nothing, but ſerve their owne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and maintaine their lives; ſo, as they might goe on in their places and callings, one halfe of the creatures might have been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But God made nothing in vaine. Therefore he is willing we ſhould uſe the creatures for moderate delight. Abraham <hi>made a great feaſt at the weaning of</hi> Iſaac; and <hi>Iſaac</hi> makes a feaſt for <hi>Abimelech and Phicol</hi> the chiefe Captaine of his Army, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.<note place="margin">Gen. 21.8.</note> 30. And the like examples we have in divers other places: And our Saviour Chriſt himſelfe was at a feaſt in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> where when wine fail'd he ſupply'd it by miracle, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>But becauſe feaſting is ſo often abuſed and many turne this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into wantonneſſe; being then moſt wicked, when they ſhould be moſt thankfull, and grieving God moſt, when he gives them meanes or occaſion of rejoycing. I ſhall therefore briefly diſcover the abuſes of feaſting, which will alſo hint rules for the right ordering of it, <hi>That we may</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>eat and drinke, and do all to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:98733:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. Then feaſting is ſinfull, when any over-charge their eſtates; and laviſh out what will but ſerve their neceſſities or convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon delights and ſuperfluities; to ſuch, <hi>Feaſting</hi> is a ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the rich <hi>feaſt</hi> the rich, and never thinke upon the poor, Luk. 14.12, 13. <hi>When thou makest a dinner or a ſupper, call not thy friends nor thy brethren, neither thy kinſmen, nor thy rich neighbours.</hi> Obſerve here, this is not an abſolute denyall of calling brethren, and kinsfolkes and friends, or rich; for brethren may, yea ought to be called, but (ſaith he) <hi>when thou makeſt a feaſt call the poore, the maimed, the lame, the blind</hi>; that is, when thou makeſt a feaſt be ſure to remember theſe, doe not bid thy brethren, or the rich alone, let the poore have a portion with thee, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed at or from thy Table. When the rich feaſt one another, and let the poore ſtarve or pine, this is very ſinfull.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When there is a ſtudied <hi>curioſity</hi> and <hi>exactneſſe in feaſting.</hi> When all things that can be thought on muſt be fetched in, ſtrange meats and forraigne ſauces, when there is a luſting after Quailes, when men muſt have meat for their luſts. Though we may have feaſting for our delight, yet we muſt not have feaſting for our luſts; <hi>Such make their belly their god,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes; when there is ſo much art uſed, as deſtroyes the nature of the meat, this is a ſinne and an errour. I remember <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks of his times, <hi>That a man might be at a fiſh feaſt, and yet ſhould not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had eaten any fiſh or no,</hi> all things were prepared with ſo much art, that the very nature of the creature was loſt. This is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vanity.</p>

When there is <hi>intemperance in feaſting</hi> (whatſoever the proviſion be) when there is exceſſe; an over-charging of nature, which is <hi>ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe.</hi> As by the former, man overthrowes the nature of meats or drinkes. So by this, meat and drinke overthrowe the nature of man. A man may feaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into a beaſt, and we uſually ſay of ſuch perſons, <hi>They are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed.</hi> For ſuch feaſting the land mournes.</p>

is a woefull expence and waſte of time; and the expence of time is worſe by farre then the expence of mony; you may regaine the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of your mony, but you can never call backe the expence of your time, you may be at greater charges in your feaſting for the waſte of time then for the waſte of eſtate. All the world cannot give you backe againe the expence of an houre. Indeed we often heare men complaine they have ſpent too much mony in feaſting and entertainments, but 'tis very rare that any complaine they have ſpent too much time: which is as if a man having received a wound in his body ſhould onely be troubled for the hole which the Sword made in his doublet.

               <p n="7">7. <hi>Feaſting is ſinfull when unſeaſonable,</hi> I ſpeake in regard of occaſions and opportunities: there are ſpeciall times wherein it is unlawfull to feaſt, though we ſhould ſpend but very little time in feaſting, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12, 13. <hi>In that day did the Lord God of Hoſts call to weeping and mourning, and to baldneſſe, and to girding with ſack-cloth, and behold ioy and gladneſſe, ſlaying Oxen and killing Sheepe, eating fleſh and drinking wine,</hi> in the next verſe it is ſaid, <hi>It was revealed in mine eares by the Lord of hoſts, ſurely this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhall not be purged from you till you die.</hi> To feaſt in that day was ſinfull, and a ſin that left ſuch a ſtaine as could not be got out, it ſhall not be purged from you. What time was this where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their feaſting was ſo ſinfull, what made this ſin ſo deepe grained? You ſhall find a reſolution in the beginning of the Chapter, <hi>It was a day of trouble and perplexity and of treading downe by the Lord God of hosts in the valley of viſion, breaking downe the walls and crying to the mountaines.</hi> It is a day of trouble and perplexity, and will you now be feaſting? (ſaith God) Is this a time for you to feaſt in, when my wrath is breaking forth amongſt you? This fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting with men is a daring of God, a ſending (as it were) defiance unto Heaven. And ſuch feaſtings <hi>Amos</hi> reproves, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>They did eat the Lambes out of the flocke, and the Calves out of the midſt of the Stall, they chaunt to the ſound of the Violl, and invent to themſelves inſtruments of muſicke like</hi> David, <hi>they drinke wine in bowles, and annoint themſelves with the chiefe oyntments, but they are not grieved for the affliction of</hi> Joſeph.</p>
               <p>Then at this time feaſting is unſeaſonable; for <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> the people and Churches of God are in affliction: And this is ſuch a day as the Prophet deſcribes, <hi>a day of trouble, and a day of perplexity

from the Lord,</hi> the Kingdome is full of trouble, and we are full of feares, therefore now faſting is in ſeaſon, not feaſting, now hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling is in ſeaſon, not rejoycing: Or if any feaſt now, let them feaſt as if they feaſted not, and rejoyce as if they rejoyced not, let them feaſt as remembring the affliction and bonds, the hunger and wants of our diſtreſſed bretheren. Therefore in thoſe feaſtings which have a kind of neceſſity in them, you ſhould labour to have your hearts exceedingly above your feaſting, not to ye ſo low as the creature; it is ever very ſinfull to have your hearts drowned in the creature, but now eſpecially when you heare the voyce of the Sword threatning to take the creature from us, and ſee God claſhing them together, as if he meant to ſtaine the beauty, and ſowre the pleaſures of them all.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Actions about which this holy care of <hi>Iob</hi> was exerciſed: They are two.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>He ſent and ſanctified them.</hi> And</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2. The ground of this holy practice of his, what moved <hi>Iob</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their feaſting, thus <hi>to ſend and ſanctifie them.</hi> The ground was this, <hi>For</hi> Job <hi>ſaid, it may be that my ſonnes have ſinned, and curſed God in their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The conſtancy of <hi>Iob</hi> in this his holy practice, he did not this by fits, now and then, but <hi>thus did</hi> Job <hi>continually.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And it was ſo, that when the dayes of their feaſting were gone about, that <hi>Job</hi> ſent and ſanctified them.</q>
               <p>That is the firſt thing that we are to explaine and open unto you, Job <hi>ſent and ſanctified them.</hi> How could <hi>Iob</hi> ſanctifie his ſonnes or his daughters? A Parent indeed may provide riches for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but can he provide grace alſo? A parent may put Money in their purſes, but can he put holineſſe in their hearts too, that it is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98733:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaid here, that <hi>Iob</hi> ſent and ſanctified them? Is not ſanctification the proper worke of the Spirit of God? doth not the Holy Ghoſt alone ſanctifie?</p>
               <p>For the clearing of this, Whereas it is ſaid that <hi>Job</hi> ſent and ſanctified them; Firſt, Some expound the meaning thus, that <hi>Job</hi> ſent up prayers to God to ſanctifie them. And indeed <hi>prayer is a ſanctifying ordinance.</hi> As prayer requireth a holy heart, ſo prayer will make a holy heart; make the heart that prayes holy, yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times get holineſſe into anothers heart. Secondly, Others ſay, <hi>he ſent and ſanctified them,</hi> that is, he ſent them to the place that was appointed for ſacrifice, where he intended to ſanctifie them; or where, in the holy duty of calling upon the Name of God and of offering ſacrifice, they <hi>were to be ſanctified:</hi> He ſent and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified them, he ſent them to the place where the Sacrifice ſhould be offered, that ſo they might <hi>be ſanctified.</hi> But thirdly, I rather take it thus, <hi>he ſent and ſanctified them,</hi> that is, he ſent a meſſage to them, to command them to prepare and to fit themſelves for the holy duty of offering the burnt offering or ſacrificing. For to <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie,</hi> in Scripture notes two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The infuſion of a holy habit, the infuſion of a new principle into the ſoule.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A preparation of the ſoule to holy duties.</p>
               <p>Now when it is ſaid that Job <hi>ſent and ſanctified them,</hi> it is not meant as if <hi>Iob</hi> did infuſe holy habits into his children, as if it were in his power to make them gracious; Indeed that is impoſſible, it is only the worke of the Spirit of God, no man can come at the ſpirit of another but the Spirit of God. But this is it, hee ſent to them to prepare themſelves, to adviſe and warne them to prepare themſelves that they might be ready for that holy duty, for the duty of ſacrificing; And this <hi>preparation</hi> to holy duties, is often called <hi>ſanctifying,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. When <hi>Iacob</hi> was called to <hi>Bethel</hi> to <hi>offer ſacrifice and to build an Altar,</hi> he ſaid to his houſhold, <hi>verſe</hi> 2. <hi>Put away the strange gods that are among you and be cleane,</hi> (that is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie you, or be you ſanctified) <hi>and let us ariſe and goe up to</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, <hi>and I will make there an Altar unto God,</hi> &amp;c, The prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſacrifice, was a cleanſing or a ſanctifying of them. So <hi>Exod</hi> 19.20. when the people were to be prepared to receive the Law, the Lord ſaith unto <hi>Moſes, Goe unto the people, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie them to day and to morrow,</hi> that is, prepare the people, or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98733:33"/>
warne the people that they prepare themſelves for the receiving of the Law. And likewiſe in the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.5. it is ſaid, that <hi>Samuel did that which the Lord ſpake, and came to</hi> Bethlem, <hi>and the Elders of the Towne trembled at his comming and ſaid, Commest thou peaceably? And he ſaid, Peaceably; I am come to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto the Lord, ſanctifie your ſelves and come with me to the Sacrifice,</hi> that is, prepare your ſelves to come to the ſacrifice. So ſanctification, is preparation. And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.55. (to name no more) <hi>The</hi> Jewes <hi>Paſſeover was nigh at hand, and many went out of the Countrey up to</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>before the Paſſeover to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie themſelves,</hi> or to ſanctifie themſelves, that they might be fit and ready for the ſacrifice. So then this ſanctifying of them, was a preparing of them for the ſacrifice. There were ſolemne rules given afterward when the forme of the Church Order and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was eſtabliſhed by <hi>Moſes</hi>; but even now before that, the Law and light of nature taught this, beſides the teaching of God, that they muſt be ſanctified before they came to ſacrifice, <hi>Iob ſent and ſanctified them, then they came to that holy ſervice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the firſt act of <hi>Iob.</hi> We may here obſerve, firſt, the time when <hi>Iob</hi> ſent to ſanctifie them, it was <hi>when the dayes of their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting were gone about; Iob</hi> did not take them off from their feaſting, or deny them the liberty of their feaſting: But when the dayes of their feaſting were gone about, then he ſent and ſanctified them. The point we may note from hence is this. That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It doth well become godly Parents, to give their Children leave to take moderate refreſhing and recreation one with another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iob</hi> did not ſeverely and auſterely forbid them and ſay, what doe you feaſting and ſpending your time idly one with another? why doe you ſpend ſo many dayes in feaſting? He never interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them till the dayes of their feaſting were gone about; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth Parents to looſe the reines of governement ſo farre, as to give them leave for their refreſhing, to let themſelves out in honeſt wayes of recreation by their mutuall ſociety. <hi>Iob</hi> did not call them to this holy ſervice from their feaſting, <hi>but when the dayes of their feaſting were gone about.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Iob</hi> ſent to ſanctifie his children, though they were in their own houſes, though they were at their own diſpoſing, (for it appeares they had families and houſholds of their owne) though they were men and women growen: Yet <hi>Iob</hi> ſent to ſanctifie them. Obſerve hence, That</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:98733:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Parents must not caſt off the care of their children, though they are growen up, though they are men and women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some thinke, that if they looke to their children at Schoole, and breed them up a while, and have given them ſome inſtructions in their youth, they need not then trouble themſelves any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whereas the care of parents ought to live as long as they and their children live together. <hi>Iobs</hi> care went after his children to their houſes, <hi>He ſent to them to bid them prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though theſe were (as we ſay) men and women growne, yet as ſoone as their Father ſends the meſſage to them, they all ſubmit and all obey, then Obſerve, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Children that are growen up, or have houſes and families of their owne, ought yet to yeeld all reverence and ſubmiſſion to the lawfull commands, counſells and directions of their Parents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doe not thinke you have outgrowen obedience and honour to Parents, when you are growen in yeares; ſtill we ſee theſe thought themſelves under their Fathers command and counſell, there is not one of them replies, what need my Father trouble himſelfe about us? No, but all willingly prepared themſelves and came, for he offred <hi>burnt offerings aocording to the number of them all,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainely they all came.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, From the matter of this Act, what it was that <hi>Iob</hi> did, the text ſaith, <hi>he ſent and ſanctified them after their feaſting</hi>; he did not ſend a meſſenger to them, to aske them how they were in health, whether they had not ſurfeted themſelves, or had got any diſtemper; he did not ſend to know how the accounts went in their families, whether they had not ſpent too much; but the matter that he had his eye and his heart upon was, that they might be ſanctified and fitted for holy duties; From hence obſerve, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Parents maine and ſpeciall care ſhould be for the ſoules of his children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The care of many Parents is onely to inrich their children, to make them great and Honourable, to leave them full portions and eſtates, to provide matches for them, but for ſanctifying their children there is no thought of that. Nay many are afraid their children ſhould be ſanctified: ſome Parents cannot abide their children, becauſe they ſuſpect them ſanctifyed: <hi>Such Parents are the Devills children. Iobs</hi> greateſt care was that his children ſhould
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98733:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be ſanctified. And every Parent ought to ſay of his naturall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> doth of his ſpirituall children, (<hi>Ep.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4.) <hi>I have no greater joy, then to heare that my children walke in the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Iob</hi> was a holy perſon, and you ſee which way his care lies, that his children may be holy, then take this Note in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee that is a holy perſon himſelfe, deſires to make others ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Holy <hi>Iob</hi> would have all his children holy. As it is with the wicked, a wicked man would faine have all wicked with him; he would faine ſcatter his wickedneſſe, and diffuſe his poiſon unto others. The drunkard would faine have companions with him in his drunkenneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo the man that is truly godly, would make others godly too. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to K. <hi>Agrippa, I would to God, that not only thou,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 26.29.</note> 
                  <hi>but alſo all that heare me this day, were both al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most and altogether ſuch as I am.</hi> Grace is attractive, It deſires to draw others into fellowſhip. A good man would not be happy alone.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Sanctification you ſee here is aſcribed unto <hi>Iob,</hi> he ſent and ſanctified them, and all that he did was but to give them counſell and warning to ſanctifie themſelves; As if he ſhould have ſaid, goe to my children, and bid them prepare themſelves, warne them, that they may be ready againſt the ſacrifice, that they fit themſelves for it, yet the text ſaith, <hi>that</hi> Job <hi>ſanctified them.</hi> Then we may obſerve from this. That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The good which others doe by our advice and counſell, is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned as done by our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While we provoke others to goodneſſe, that good which they doe, is ſet upon our account, as if we had done it. As the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the ſin which another commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s by the advice and counſell of any man, is ſet upon the ſcore of that man: If another doe ill by thy advice, the ill is reckoned to thee; if one ſhould come and ſay as <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſaid to his ſervants, <hi>Marke ye now when</hi> Amnons <hi>heart is merry with wine, and when I ſay unto you, ſmite</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>then kill him, feare not, have not I commanded you?</hi> Not only did the ſervants kill <hi>Amnon,</hi> but <hi>Abſolom</hi> killed <hi>Amnon,</hi> becauſe he commanded them to kill him. You know what is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> he did but ſend a Letter concerning the death of <hi>Vriah,</hi> and the charge cometh, <hi>Thou hast ſlaine</hi> Uriah <hi>with the Sword of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98733:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the children of</hi> Ammon. All the evill others commit by thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, direction, advice, command or conſent, is as done by thy ſelfe. So (on the other ſide) all the good others doe by our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, advice, promotion, admonition, inſtruction and the like, that good ſhall all be reckoned to us. If another be holy by thy adviſe, it will be ſaid thou haſt made him holy, thou haſt ſanctified him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Obſerve, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holy duties call for holy preparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt not touch holy things with unholy hands, or with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy hearts; <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocency, and ſo will I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe thine Altar O Lord,</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 26.6. therefore <hi>Job</hi> intending a ſolemne duty, a ſacrifice, which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſumme of all Religion concerning the externall worſhip of God, ſends ſolemnely to his children to prepare themſelves: O come not to the ſacrifice except you be ſanctified. It is a point ſo cleare, that I ſhall need but only to name it to you. How and wherein they ſhould ſanctifie themſelves, and what courſe they took for the ſanctifying and preparing of themſelves for that duty, doth not appeare in this place: but afterwards when God gave them the Law, he preſcribed them a rule what they muſt doe that they might be ſanctified; the Jewes had ſpeciall directions for their preparations: Some things were outward, and ſome inward. I will but touch.</p>
               <p>For the outward, they were commanded to waſh their cloathes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. that place before quoted, <hi>Sanctifie them to day and to morrow, and let them waſh their cloathes:</hi> Not that God regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded cloathes, but he aymed at ſomewhat further; if the cloathes muſt be waſhed, certainely then the heart muſt be waſhed, he pointed at that in the waſhing of their cloathes; In <hi>Leviticus</hi> and <hi>Numbers,</hi> other outward preparations are commanded, <hi>as the abſtaining from all things that were uncleane, they muſt not touch any thing that was uncleane</hi>; and then ſometimes they were not only to waſh their cloathes, but to change their cloathes: you have the expreſſion in that place concerning <hi>Jacob, be cleane</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and change your garments</hi>; It might be a changing by waſhing, but I rather conceive, that it was a change by putting on of other cloathes. There was alſo another externall requiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prieſt ſaid, <hi>There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread, if the young men have kept themſelves at leaſt from women</hi>; if they have but that outward preparation: the meaning is, if they had kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their Wives; <hi>David</hi> affirmes it was ſo, in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. The Apoſtle giveth the ſame rule in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. ſpeaking of that point, <hi>Defraud not one another</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>except it be with conſent for a time, that you may give your ſelves to faſting and prayer.</hi> So that the Holy Ghoſt therein intimates ſuch an abſtaining as was preparatory to ſolemne duties, <hi>that you may give your ſelves to faſting and prayer,</hi> extraordinary duties call for extraordinary preparations.

Land,</hi> the word is, <hi>I will destroy the wicked of the Land in the morning,</hi> and the meaning is only this, I will with all diligence and all care roote out of the Land all wicked perſons. So there is an expreſſion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.15. which illuſtrates this; where the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked woman, the harlot tells the young man, <hi>that ſhee came forth to meete him and diligently to ſeek his face:</hi> the originall word there is, <hi>to ſeek thy face in the morning</hi>; and yet we know, that in <hi>verſe</hi> 9. it was in the <hi>twi-light, in the evening that ſhe met him.</hi> But the Hebrew phraſe is, <hi>I came forth in the morning to ſeeke thy face,</hi> that is (as it is rendred) <hi>I came forth diligently to ſeeke thy face.</hi> So this comming forth of <hi>Job</hi> in the morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſides the time, that it was at ſuch an houre, the beginning of the day; notes the great diligence and exceeding care of <hi>Job</hi> about this worke.</p>
               <p>Yet more exactly, it is not only ſaid, <hi>he roſe in the morning</hi> (for there is a great latitude in the morning, there are divers houres which all are called morning) but it is ſaid he roſe <hi>early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> in the very beginning or firſt of the morning. As it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Exod,</hi> 23.19· <hi>The first of the firſt fruits of the Land thou ſhalt bring into the houſe of the Lord.</hi> God would not only have the <hi>first fruits,</hi> but the <hi>first of the first fruits,</hi> if there were any ripe ſooner then others, God would have them; ſome fruits that ripen'd after, were firſt fruits, but God would have the very firſt of them. So here, <hi>Job</hi> gave God not only the firſt fruits of the day, but the earlieſt time, in the morning, which is the firſt of the firſt fruits of the day.</p>
               <q>Early in the morning.</q>
               <p>Then Obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is Gods due and our duty, to dedicate the morning, the first and best of every day unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pſal. 5.3. <hi>My voice ſhalt thou heare in the morning, in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will looke up.</hi> We have a ſaying among us, <hi>that the morning is a friend to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that is, the morning is a good ſtudying time. I am ſure it is as true, that <hi>the morning it is a great friend to the Graces,</hi> the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is the beſt praying time.</p>
               <p>Againe, In that <hi>Job</hi> did riſe ſo early in the morning to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and did this becauſe he was afraid that his ſonnes had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (as we ſhall ſee afterward,) Hence Obſerve,</p>

               <p>If a mans houſe be on fire, he will not only riſe in the morning, or early in the morning, but he will riſe at mid-night to quench it; certainly when you have guilt on your ſoules, you have a fire in your ſoules, your ſoules are on a flame: therefore you had need riſe and riſe early, and get up as ſoon in the morning as you can to get it quenched and put out.</p>

eyes,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>their ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their spirits</hi> heaven-wards, and powred themſelves forth in prayer unto God. That of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. will give ſome light to this, <hi>Let</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my prayer be ſet forth before thee as incenſe, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening Sacrifice.

               <p>For the perſon, It is ſaid that <hi>Job offered</hi> theſe Sacrifices, <hi>Job roſe early and offered</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. Was not this to uſurpe upon the Prieſts office?<note place="margin">2 Chro. 26.18.</note> Was it not this for which King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> was reprehended and told by the Prieſts, <hi>It appertaineth not to thee, to burne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe unto the Lord, but to the Prieſts, the ſonnes of</hi> Aaron; and was he not ſmitten with <hi>leproſie</hi> for doing of it?</p>
               <p>I anſwer in a word by that rule of the Ancients. <hi>Distinguiſh the times and Scriptures will agree:</hi> It was <hi>Job</hi> that offered and <hi>Job</hi> had right to offer. The <hi>time</hi> wherein <hi>Job</hi> offered Sacrifice doth <hi>reconcile</hi> this; it was before the giving of the Law (as we
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98733:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have ſhewed in the opening of the former points about the time when <hi>Job</hi> lived) now in thoſe times the <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>the elder of the Family</hi> was as a Prieſt to the whole Family: and he had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the right to performe all holy family duties; as the duty of ſacrificing and the like, this you may ſee carried along in all the times before the Law was given, in the holy Stories of the Patriarks, they ſtill offered up the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>But it may here be further inquired, If it were before the Law was given, who taught <hi>Job</hi> to offer Sacrifice? Where had he the rule for it?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, this was not <hi>will-worſhip,</hi> though it was not written worſhip. For howſoever <hi>Job</hi> did offer Sacrifice before the <hi>Law of ſacrificing was written,</hi> yet he did not offer a Sacrifice <hi>before the Law of ſacrificing was given</hi>; for the Law of ſacrificing was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the beginning, as all the other parts of worſhip uſed from the beginning were. God could never beare it, that men ſhould contrive him a ſervice; therefore <hi>Job</hi> did not offer up an offering unto God, according to his owne will, a thing that he had inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to pacifie and to pleaſe God with: God had been ſo farre from accepting, that he could not have borne ſuch a deviſed worſhip. God doth never truſt man with the making of holy Inſtitutions. There is nothing doth pleaſe him in any act of worſhip, unleſſe he ſees himſelfe obeyed, <hi>Obedience is better then Sacrifice,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Sacrifice which is not out of obedience cannot be accepted; he that ſacrificeth doth but <hi>offer up a beaſt,</hi> but he that obeyeth, <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth up himſelfe,</hi> ſacrificeth his owne will. It could not be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but that <hi>Job</hi> had a word, a word as all the world had at that time; a word given by God, and ſo carried downe from one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by tradition (as it was for more then 2000. yeares) All the will that God would reveale or had revealed to them was carried from <hi>hand to hand,</hi> or from <hi>heart to heart,</hi> from the Fathers to the children, till at the laſt the Law was written, and the Scripture penned by <hi>Moſes.</hi> So then <hi>Job</hi> offered Sacrifice according to an Inſtitution, though it was not an Inſtitution written, yet it was an Inſtitution ſent foorth and given by God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Yet there is a third <hi>Quere</hi> upon it. Suppoſe that there was an Inſtitution of God for ſacrificing; why did God call for Sacrifices? What is his meaning?<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Doth God delight in the bloud of Bulls and Goats? Thou delighteſt not in ſacrifices</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) thou
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98733:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deſireſt not burnt offerings.</hi> And what was the Sacrifice unto <hi>Job,</hi> or unto his ſonnes? Could the killing of a Beaſt take away ſinne? Why then doth <hi>Job,</hi> when he feareth that his ſons had ſinned, goe preſently and offer Sacrifice?</p>
               <p>For anſwer. It is true that the Sacrifices in themſelves were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, either to God or man; they could doe no good, they had no power in them, either to <hi>pacifie God</hi> or to <hi>purge the ſoules of men,</hi> But looke upon the Sacrifice, as it was an Inſtitution, and then God ſaw his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt in it, and was well-pleaſed: and likewiſe man beheld and believed Chriſt in it, and was purged. When the Sacrifice was offering, man ſaw Chriſt ſuffering, this tooke away his ſin and pacified his conſcience A Sacrifice in it ſelf, as it was the killing or burning of a Beaſt had no vertue in it, but as it had reſpect unto Chriſt, ſo God ſaw the death of his ſon, and that ſatisfied him, and man ſaw the death of his Saviour, and that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified him.</p>
               <p>Againe, it was not the bare Sacrifice that was effectuall, but the faith of <hi>Job,</hi> and the faith of his ſons carried up in prayer; theſe mingled with the Sacrifice wrought the cure. Therfore we find in the time of the Sacrifice, ſtill the people were at prayer, they knew the Sacrifice, the Incenſe, could doe nothing, but as joyned with the faith of the Sacrificer in prayer. We reade, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.10. when <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Prieſt was offering the Incenſe within in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Text ſaith, <hi>that the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of Incenſe.</hi> The Incenſe might burne long enough, and yet the anger of God burne too, the Incenſe might burne, and yet the people not purified, but conſumed. But while the Incenſe was burning, while the Sacrifice was offering, the people were praying and beleeving. Theſe actings of faith, and powrings out of prayer made the Sacrifice as effectuall for man, ſo acceptable unto God.</p>
               <p>Then in that he offered <hi>burnt-offerings,</hi> which burnt-offerings were made when he feared that his ſons had ſinned, theſe offerings typing out and leading them to Chriſt and his death; We may note this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Chriſt was ever the only remedy and cure of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoone as ever there vvas any feare of ſinne, preſently they had recourſe to a ſacrifice; and what was that? They went to <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> hath been the helpe againſt ſin in all the generations of the world from the firſt,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1.</note> and will be to the laſt. <hi>If any man ſin</hi> (ſaith

the Apoſtle <hi>John) we have an Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes,</hi> He is the <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifice for our ſins.</hi> It follows,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to the number of them all</hi>] That is, he offered for each of his ſonnes a Sacrifice. There were ſome Sacrifices, which did ſerve for the <hi>whole Congregation,</hi> as we may ſee in <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.13, 14. and in divers other Chapters of that booke. Beſides theſe there were <hi>perſonall Sacrifices,</hi> Levit. 1. where the Lawes about Sacrifices are ſet forth; If any ſoule had ſinned, that particular ſoule muſt come to the Prieſt, and bring a Sacrifice for his ſin. So here, <hi>Job</hi> doth not offer only one <hi>generall family ſacrifice</hi> for them all, but he offereth up a <hi>distinct particular ſacrifice</hi> for every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſon. This teacheth us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That every one is ſaved and pardoned by the ſpeciall and particular actings of his owne faith, <hi>Every ſoule muſt beleeve for it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every one muſt have a ſacrifice. We have Congregationall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and we have perſonall prayers; now it is not enough for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pray in publike with the Miniſter, or for the Miniſter (who is the mouth of the Congregation to God) to offer up a prayer for the pardon of the people. But every one muſt apart and by himſelfe ſue out his own pardon, which is, as it were, his owne ſacrifice, by offering up and tendering of Jeſus Chriſt unto God for the pardon of his ſins.</p>
               <p>Then againe you may note, in that <hi>Job</hi> offered a Sacrifice for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of his ſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is not enough for Parents to pray in generall for their children, but they ought to pray particularly for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Parents who have many children, provide portions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of them all, and proportion out their care perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, according to the number of them all; and in the Family they provide meat and cloathing, according to the particular number of them all. So likewiſe they ought to be at a proportionable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in ſpirituals, to lay out and lay up prayers and interceſſions, <hi>according to the number of them all</hi>; not only to pray in generall, that God would bleſſe their children and their family, but even to ſet them <hi>one by one</hi> before God, and ſo beg and ſue out a ſpeciall bleſſing upon the head of every one of them, as without all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Job</hi> did, when the Sacrifice for every ſon was made, he ſent up a prayer to God for the pardon and acceptance of every ſon. That
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98733:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the opening of the ſecond act in the Text, firſt he ſent and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them; and ſecondly, he offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all.</p>
               <p>Now follows the ground or the reaſon of this act of <hi>Job,</hi> both in ſanctifying them and in offering Sacrifices for them. <hi>For</hi> Job <hi>ſaid it may be my ſonnes have ſinned and curſed God in their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Holy duties muſt be grounded upon reaſon. There muſt be a reaſon why we pray, before we pray, we muſt ſee cauſe for it, and great cauſe too. To pray out of cuſtome and formality, to offer ſacrifice onely, becauſe it is a day of Sacrifice, is not praying nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing. <hi>Job</hi> had a ſpeciall reaſon, <hi>For</hi> Job <hi>ſaid it may be my ſons have ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us examine the reaſon a little, <hi>It may be my ſons have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> What is it come to <hi>an it may be</hi> with <hi>Job</hi> that his ſons have ſinned? What ſons had <hi>Job?</hi> Surely they were more than men, that the Father is but at a Queſtion, whether his ſonnes have ſinned or no? <hi>Solomon</hi> after an <hi>If</hi> concerning ſin, reſolves it into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.46. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they ſinne againſt thee</hi> (here he makes a ſuppoſition, but you ſee he goes not one ſtep from it before he makes a direct aſſertion) for (ſaith he) <hi>there is no man that ſinneth not:</hi> and yet <hi>Job</hi> puts it with anuncorrected <hi>If,</hi> or, <hi>it may be my ſons have ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the opening of this. Without all queſtion <hi>Job</hi> was fully and thoroughly ſtudied in that point of the univerſall corruption of man; his <hi>disputings</hi> (as we ſhall ſee afterwards in this booke) ſufficiently evince it. <hi>What is man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that he ſhould be perfect, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> he that is borne of a woman that he ſhould be cleane?</hi> Here, by ſinning then, we are to underſtand ſomething more than ordinary ſinning. To ſin ſometime is put for common and daily infirmities, ſuch as doe inſeparably and inevitably cleave unto us, ſuch as conſidering the ſtate and condition wherin we are, <hi>having corrupt fleſh and bloud about us,</hi> we cannot be freed from. As a man who in the morning waſheth his hands and goes abroad about his buſineſſe and affaires in the world, though he doth not puddle in the mire or take among dung-hils: yet when he returnes home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to dinner or at night, if he waſh, he finds that he hath contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſome uncleanneſſe, and that his hands are foule; we cannot converſe in an uncleane and dirty world with our bodies, but ſome uncleanneſſe will faſten upon them. So it is with the ſoule, the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98733:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſoules of the beſt, of the pureſt, of the holieſt, though they do not rake in the dung-hill, and wallow in the mire of ſin baſely and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, yet they doe from day to day, yea from moment to moment contract ſome filth and uncleanneſſe. And in this ſenſe it is that <hi>there is no man that liveth and ſinneth not.</hi> Every man hath a <hi>Fountaine of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſſe in him,</hi> and there will be ever ſome ſinne, ſome filthineſſe bubbling and boyling up, if not flowing forth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To ſin is put for ſome ſpeciall act of ſin, that which in Scripture is called a Fall; <hi>If any man be overtaken with a fault, you that are ſpirituall reſtore him.</hi> And in this ſenſe the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith (which is a cleare anſwer to this doubt, and doth open the terme) <hi>I write unto you little children, that you ſinne not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1.</note> He did not write to them an impoſſible thing, he writ to them, about that which in a <hi>Goſpell ſenſe,</hi> they might attain unto.</p>
               <p>There are 3 degrees of ſinning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is one kind of ſinning, which is called a <hi>daily infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> which the Saints of God, the beſt in this life are not freed from.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another kind of ſinning,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9.</note> which is to <hi>ſinne wilfully and with pure delight</hi>; and thus, <hi>he that is borne of God cannot ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is another kind of ſinning, which is called <hi>falling into ſinne, or the falls of the Saints,</hi> and ſometimes we know they have fallen into great and ſcandalous ſins: In this ſenſe it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Little children I write to you that you ſinne not.</hi> That is; though you have daily infirmities, yet take heed of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinnings. So here in the Text, where it is ſaid, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned.</hi> It is not meant either in the firſt or ſecond ſenſe; it is not meant, as if he thought his ſons were without infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, nor is it meant that he did ſuſpect them of thoſe ſins (which are indeed incompatible with the ſtate of grace) ſins of perfect wilfulneſſe and of malice or the like: but it is of thoſe ſins in the middle ſort. It may be my ſons have ſinned, that is, have ſinned ſo as to provoke God and ſcandalize men in this their feaſting, in their meeting together.</p>
               <p>We may note from that firſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that liveth without groſſe ſinnes, in a Gospell ſenſe, liveth without ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To be without great and groſſe ſinne is our holineſſe upon earth;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98733:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be without any ſinne, is the holineſſe of Heaven.</hi> He that liveth without fault, <hi>ſine querela</hi> (as it is ſaid of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi> that <hi>they lived blameleſly</hi>) in <hi>Gospell account,</hi> is ſaid to live without any ſin at all.</p>
               <p>Another point we may collect from this [<hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned.] Certainly then</hi> Jobs <hi>ſonnes were godly.</hi> If <hi>Job</hi> be at a queſtion whether they have ſinned, they were godly without queſtion.</p>
               <p>When a man lives ſo, that he leaves onely a ſuſpition that he hath ſinned, we may be at a concluſion that he is ſanctified. For other perſons can do nothing elſe, but ſin, even in holy actions, much more in civill or naturall.</p>
               <p>Again [<hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned</hi>] it was a ſuſpition in <hi>Job</hi> concerning his children. Hence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is no breach of charity to ſuspect ill of others, while we intend their good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed upon an <hi>It may be,</hi> upon a peradventure to accuſe and charge another, is very uncharitable; but upon a <hi>peradventure,</hi> or an <hi>It may be,</hi> ſuch a one, my child, or my friend, or my brother hath ſinned, to be put to pray for him, this is very charitable. A good heart turnes it's ſuſpitions of others ſinnings and failings into prayers and interceſſions, that they may be pardon'd; not into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations and ſlanders, that they may be defam'd. The uſe which <hi>Job</hi> made here of his ſuſpition of his ſonnes ſinning was to turne it into prayer and ſupplication for the pardon of their ſinne.</p>
               <p>One thing further from this, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Job</hi> knew of no evill, that his ſons had committed, he had no report that we reade of that his ſons had behaved themſelves unſeemely in their meetings and feaſtings; he onely doubteth, he only is jealous and afraid that they had: yet at this time he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſacrificeth and laboureth a reconcilement for them. Note from hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſuſpiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n that we our ſelves or others have ſinned against God, is ground enough for us to ſeeke a reconcilement for our ſelves or others with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you that are tender Parents have but a ſuſpition, if there be but all, <hi>it may be,</hi> that your child hath the Plague or taken the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, will it not be ground enough for you to goe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and give your child a good medicine? If any one of you have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98733:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but a ſuſpition, that either your ſelves or your friends have taken <hi>poyſon,</hi> though you be not certaine of it, will it not be ground enough for you to take or to give an Antidote preſently. Sinne is as a <hi>plague,</hi> it is as a <hi>poyſon,</hi> therefore while you have but a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, either of your ſelves or of others, that you have ſinned or failed thus or thus; here is ground enough for you to take an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote, to take a Preſervative, to ſeeke all the meanes you can to heale your ſoules and to make your peace with God.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>Iob</hi> prayed thus, when he only ſuſpected his ſons had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: what ſhall we ſay of thoſe Parents, who are little troubled, when they ſee and know their ſons have ſinned.</p>
               <p>It is ſafeſt to repent even of thoſe ſinnes we only feare we have committed: for then we ſhall be ſure to repent of thoſe we have committed. A ſcrupulous conſcience grieves for what it ſuſpects, a feared conſcience is not grieved for what it is <hi>certaine either it ſelfe or others have done amiſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Where had <hi>Iobs</hi> ſonnes beene that he is thus ſuſpitious? Had they beene in any ſuſpected place? No, it was only in their owne houſes. Had they beene about any unlawfull thing? No, it was only at a friendly meeting, feaſting of brothers and ſiſters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Yet <hi>Iob</hi> is affraid leaſt his ſonnes had ſinned. Hence obſerve, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We may quickly offend and breake the Law while we are about things in their own nature lawfull, eſpecially in feaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an eaſie matter to ſinne while the thing you are about is not ſinnefull, nay while the thing you are about is holy. We may ſuſpect our ſelves that we have ſinned when we have beene praying, much more then when we have beene feaſting; We may ſuſpect our ſelves that we have ſinned when we have beene hearing the word, ſpeaking the word, juſt cauſe then much more we have to ſuſpect our ſelves when we have beene trading, buying or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and working abroad in the world. Lawfull things are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the occaſion of unlawfull. All the ſinnes of the old world are deſcribed thus, <hi>they eate, they dranke, they bought, they ſold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 17.27, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>they planted,</hi> &amp;c. There is not one of theſe an act evill in it ſelfe, yet they ſinned away their peace, and ſinned away their ſoules, in dealing about theſe things. Therefore as you muſt be afraid of all things in their owne nature unlawfull, ſo be jealous of your ſelves in things that are lawfull. It followes,</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:98733:41"/>And curſed God in their hearts.</q>
               <p>Interpreters are much divided about the ſence of theſe words.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some obſerve that the Hebrew word <hi>Barach,</hi> doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie not only to <hi>bleſſe,</hi> but to <hi>bow the knee</hi>; So it is uſed 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Solomon</hi> at the dedicating of the Temple <hi>had made a braſen ſcaffold, and upon it he ſtood and kneeled downe upon his knees before all the Congregation.</hi> The word there <hi>kneeled downe upon his knees,</hi> in the Originall is the ſame here uſed. But</p>

                     </gap>
                  </note>Then further, the word <hi>Elohim,</hi> is uſed in Scripture, not only for the true God, for God himſelfe: but it is applied ſometimes to <hi>Angels,</hi> and ſometimes to <hi>Idols,</hi> to <hi>Devill gods,</hi> to <hi>falſe gods.</hi> Exod. 18.11. <hi>Now I know that the Lord is greater then all gods, ſc.</hi> then all the Idols that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did truſt upon.</p>
               <p>

                     </gap>
                  </note>They obſerve further, that the Hebrew <hi>Leb,</hi> [in their hearts <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebabbam</hi>] doth ſignifie not only the heart, but the middle or center of a thing. As when it is ſaid in the Scripture, they went downe into the middeſt of the Sea,<note place="margin">Pſal. 46.2.</note> the word is, they went downe into the heart of the Sea; and in the <hi>middeſt</hi> of the earth, it is the <hi>heart of the earth</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.18.</note> And ſo when it is ſaid that <hi>Abſolom</hi> was hanging in the middeſt of the Oake, the Originall word is, he was left hanging in the <hi>heart of the Oake.</hi> From all all theſe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſingle termes, the ſenſe is made up thus; <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, bowing downe to the falſe gods that are in the middeſt of them:</hi> I confeſſe Feaſting and falſe-worſhip, ſenſuality and Idolatry goe often together, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.6. When the <hi>Golden Calfe</hi> was made, they <hi>ſate downe to eate,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Moſes</hi> foretells, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.20. <hi>When they ſhall have eaten and filled themſelves and wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en fat, then will they turne unto other gods.</hi> Yet I cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this of <hi>Jobs</hi> children: ſurely he who had beſtowed ſo much care in their inſtitution, and had them ſtill under his eye, could not ſuſpect them of degenerating ſo ſoone into ſuch palpable Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Others take the word [<hi>Barach,</hi>] in the Originall, in its proper ſenſe, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned,</hi> and bleſſed God; and they expound and open it thus. It may be my ſonnes have ſinned, and inſtead of being humbled and ſeeking to God for the pardon of their ſinnes, they have <hi>rejoyced and bleſſed God.</hi> Juſt as if a Theefe that hath ſped well and hath got a good prey, ſhould thanke God that he hath proſpered ſo well in his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98733:41"/>
wickedneſſe: So here (as if <hi>Job</hi> ſhould ſay) <hi>my ſonnes have done ill in their feastings, and they are ſo farre from being humbled, that they have bleſſed God in their hearts: they have bin lifted up, they have given God thanks for the plenty of creatures, but have not repented for their abuſe of the creatures.</hi> So we may interpret it by that place, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.4. where there is ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, the Lord ſpeaking to Chriſt ſaith. <hi>Feede the flock of the ſlaughter; whoſe poſſeſſours ſtay them and hold themſelves not guilty.</hi> (They that ſhould have beene the feeders of the flock, inſtead of feeding them, have deſtroyed them; yea they doe this and hold themſelves not guilty) <hi>and they that ſell them ſay, bleſſed be the Lord, for I am rich.</hi> They grew rich by ſelling ſoules, (as many ſince have lived by the ſame trade, ſtarving the people to feed themſelves,) the juſt character of an idle Idoll ſhepheard, and then they ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be God we are growne very rich, and have got much goods though we have done little good.</hi> This is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond interpretation and a cleare one, only me thinks it layes too high a ſtaine of wickedneſſe on <hi>Jobs</hi> ſonnes; <hi>It is one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wickedneſſes for a man to bleſſe himſelfe in his ſinnes: but for a man to bleſſe God in his ſinnes, is farre worſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Others interpret <hi>Benedicere</hi> by <hi>Valedicere,</hi> bleſſing by departing. Thus, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned and departed from God in their hearts:</hi> and they bring ſome Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein the word [<hi>Barach</hi>] ſignifies to depart, or to take leave, and goe away: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.10. Jacob <hi>bleſſed</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and went out from before</hi> Pharaoh, he bleſſed him and departed: So it is ſaid likewiſe of <hi>Joab,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.22, when he had obtained what he deſired, <hi>he fell to the ground on his face and bowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and thanked (or bleſſed) the King and went out.</hi> Now they would interpret this, <hi>Bleſſed God in their hearts,</hi> to the ſame ſenſe, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned, and bleſſed God in their hearts,</hi> that is, have departed from God in their hearts. Indeed every ſinne is a departure from God, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Take heed least there be in any of you an evill heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe to depart from the living God.</hi> Sinne is a turning away from God, yet every ſinne is not, nay few ſins are a farewell to God. But I ſhall lay by this interpretation, for the proofes come not home, no nor neere the point. In both thoſe places, bleſſing is not put barely for departing; and beſides, departing in thoſe Texts is taken in a good ſenſe: <hi>Jacob</hi> departed from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> not in a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98733:42"/>
way of <hi>deſerting</hi> him, but in a way of <hi>ſaluting</hi> him: So <hi>Joab</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the King, not that he did revolt from him, (as they would have the word to import a kind of revolting, and apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing from God) but onely he did obeyſance and went away about his buſineſſe, therefore this interpretation cannot ſtand.</p>
               <p>There is a fourth expoſition much laboured by <hi>Sanctius</hi> (and would it hold, it were an excellent expoſition) according to the letter of the Text; Thus, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned, and not bleſſed God in their hearts</hi>; and ſo he makes thoſe words to be <hi>exegeticall,</hi> the explication of the former, what the ſinne of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſonnes was, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned, and if you would know what they have ſinned in, I feare they have forgot to give God the glory for the refreſhing they have had by the creatures, they have not bleſſed God.</hi> This were an excellent and cleare ſenſe. But the way he takes to make it out, is very obſcure: For he doth it only by this rule, when (ſaith he) there is a negative particle in the former, a negative likewiſe is to be underſtood in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauſe. His rule he cleares by divers inſtances. But we find in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s place no negative particle, as <hi>Non,</hi> or <hi>Ne,</hi> or the like, in the former part of the <hi>verſe</hi>; and how there ſhould be a negative in the latter, I cannot underſtand according to his rule: <hi>Ne fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> (It is here ſaid,) <hi>It may be</hi> my ſons have ſinned, (that is a word of doubting not denyall, rather an affirmative then a negative,) and have not bleſſed; now ſaith he, though that particle <hi>(not)</hi> be not in the Hebrew, yet it muſt be underſtood of <hi>courſe,</hi> becauſe there is a negative particle in the former part: How he can make <hi>(ne forte)</hi> peradventure, a negative particle, I doe not well apprehend, yet the ſenſe in it ſelfe is very good, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned, and not bleſſed God in their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some would reade it with an Interrogation, (though I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether the Grammer will allow it,) Thus, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned, and have they bleſſed God in their hearts</hi>? As if he had ſaid, I feare they have not bleſſed God, or not bleſſed him cordially; Neglect of, or ſlightneſſe in ſuch a duty, calls for ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That meaning which our Tranſlation leads unto is moſt commonly taken by Interpreters both Ancient and moderne; Namely, That here in this Text the word [<hi>Barach</hi>] is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by curſing, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned and curſed God in their hearts.</hi> I ſhall preſent you with the grounds of this
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98733:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Interpretation, and how it is made good. And then leave it to the Readers judgement, whether to chooſe this or thoſe former which have had any countenance ſhewed them. For in a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which may without impeachment of any truth, admit divers ſences, I would not be ſo poſitive in one as to reject all others.</p>
               <p>Now this Tranſlation is maintained by a figure, either by an <hi>Antiphraſis,</hi> which is the ſpeaking of a thing ſounding one way when it is meant another way, when there is an oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the letter of the word and the meaning of the word.

Or by an <hi>Euphemiſmus,</hi> that is, when ſome filthy or execrable matter is expreſſed, by a word of a fairer ſignification. So in Scripture, the uncleaneneſſe of ſome things is covered with a word, that ſo the offenſiveneſſe of it may be removed both from the eare and phancy. As for example, that veſſell wherein na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth unburthen it ſelfe, it is called, <hi>a veſſell wherein there is no pleaſure:</hi> and ſo the word that the Hebrews uſe for a <hi>Harlot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 22.28. Hoſ. 8.8.</note> ſignifies properly a <hi>Holy woman,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. when <hi>Judah</hi> asked whether they ſaw the harlot,<note place="margin">

                  </note> the word in the Hebrew (<hi>Kedeſah</hi>) ſignifies <hi>a holy woman,</hi> by an <hi>Antiphraſis,</hi> or by an <hi>Euphemiſmus.</hi> Yet ſome thinke a <hi>harlot</hi> ſo called, becauſe (holineſſe being the dedication of a thing or perſon,) ſuch dedicate and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to, or are poſſeſs'd with a ſpirit of uncleaneneſſe. But to the Text; take it by an <hi>Euphemiſmus,</hi> or faire ſpeaking. <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned and curſed God in their hearts: they even abhorring</hi> to uſe ſuch a word concerning God, expreſſe it by <hi>bleſſing, It may be my ſonnes have ſinned and bleſſed God in their hearts.</hi> So the Latines uſe the word, <hi>Sacrum pro exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now taking it thus according to the common ſtreame of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors upon the place, it may yet be doubted, how <hi>Job</hi> could ſuſpect his ſonnes of this, that they ſhould curſe God?</p>
               <p>I anſwer to that. Here we are not to take curſing either for that abhominable act (at which Heathens bluſh,) the caſting of open reproach upon the Name of God: or for a malitious and virulent, though ſecret blaſpheming of God, and ſending defiance to Heaven in their hearts. But <hi>to curſe God in the heart,</hi> doth ſignifie any irreverent, undue, unfit, unholy thought of God, any thought unbecomming the Glory and Majeſty of ſo great a God,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98733:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which how quickly the heart may ſend out, eſpecially at a feaſt, who feeles not, who findes not? God is ſaid to be curſed when he hath not that reverence and honour which belongs to him, <hi>whoſe Name is Holy and Reverent.</hi> In that ſenſe only we are to underſtand the word curſing here. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Broughton</hi> gives a tranſlation which lets in ſome light to this, <hi>It may be my ſonnes have ſinned, and little bleſſed God in our hearts,</hi> that is, they have not had ſuch high, ſuch holy thoughts of God as became them, <hi>they have little bleſſed God</hi>; careleſſe thoughts of God are <hi>little bleſſing</hi> of God, and both amount to a curſing of God.</p>
               <p>So that the ſenſe which reſults is this, As if <hi>Job</hi> ſhould have ſaid, <hi>I am well enough ſatisfied concerning my ſonnes, that they have not broadly blaſphemed God, that they have not beene ſuch as have torne his Name with oathes, curſings and execrations: yet notwithstanding I know the heart is a deceitfull thing, there are many ſtarting holes in it, it quickly conceives, and cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceales a ſinne; and therefore I am very doubtfull, though my ſonnes have carried it fairely and well in their actions and words while they feasted, that yet their hearts have been looſe, and their affections vaine, I am afraid they have curſed, lightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, or little bleſſed God in their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve, Firſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That we ought to keepe our hearts with all manner of keeping, in every thing we goe about.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If your hearts are diſorderly, it is a kind of curſing God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not only to keepe your hearts when you are praying and when you are hearing, and when you are in holy duties; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to keepe your hearts when you are feaſting and refreſhing your ſelves, when you are in your callings, when you are buying and ſelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Note,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſinnes of the heart, ſinnefull thoughts are very dangerous ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> could not accuſe his ſonnes of load blaſphemies, he only ſuſpected the ſilent ſinnes of the heart, yet he offereth ſacrifice for them.</p>
               <p>Againe, When <hi>Iob</hi> hath nothing to charge his ſonnes with, but onely ſinnes of the heart, you ſee it is with an <hi>It may be my ſonnes have curſed God in their hearts,</hi> he doth not ſpeake directly or poſitively, that they have done ſo. Whence note,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:98733:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>That no man can poſitively conclude what is wrought in the heart of another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The heart is Gods peculiar, as he only hath the lock and key of the heart, to ſhut or open it, ſo he only hath a window to looke into it; we may gueſſe at the heart, we may ſay, <hi>it may be,</hi> further we cannot goe. The hearts of men often come forth at their mouthes, and appeare in their actions, and then indeed we may conclude their hearts are naught, <hi>For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh, and the hand worketh</hi>; but unleſſe we have that teſtimony, unleſſe the heart give that witneſſe againſt it ſelfe, we can only ſuſpect it; It may be thus or thus God alone can tell when we curſe him in our hearts, and (if we goe on impenitently in them,) irreverent thoughts will be interpreted a curſing of God.</p>
               <q>Thus did <hi>Job</hi> continually.</q>
               <p>This is the third thing to be opened in this <hi>verſe,</hi> to wit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of <hi>Job.</hi> We have ſeene the Acts of his ſpirituall care, and the ground of it, his feare leaſt his ſonnes had ſinned. Now we have the conſtancy of this duty. <hi>Thus did</hi> Job <hi>continually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Continually.</hi>] The Originall is, <hi>all the days,</hi> thus did <hi>Job,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Cunctis diebus,</hi> all dayes, that is all the dayes that this occaſion did offer it ſelfe. When his ſonnes went to feaſting, then ever <hi>Job</hi> went to praying and to ſacrificing. Continually, or all the dayes, doth not import that <hi>Job</hi> did offer ſacrifice every day; This <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually</hi> is to be underſtood in the renewed ſeaſons; All the dayes, are thoſe dayes wherein occaſion was given. We are then ſaid to doe a thing continually when we doe it ſeaſonably, ſo thoſe places of Scripture are to be underſtood: <hi>Pray without ceaſing</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.17. Eph. 6.18.</note> not that a man ſhould doe nothing elſe but pray, but that he ſhould labour to have his heart in a praying frame alwayes, and ſhould actually pray as often as duty requires; ſuch an one <hi>prayes alwayes.</hi> So here, <hi>Iobs</hi> offering ſacrifice continually, noteth only the conſtancy and perſeverance of <hi>Iob</hi> in the duty, that ſo often as there was an occaſion renewed, <hi>Iob</hi> renewed this ſervice and holy care concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſonnes, for reconciling them unto God. <hi>Iob</hi> had many other things to doe in the world, he had a calling, yet he offered ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice continually.</p>
               <p>It is an excellent point of ſpirituall wiſedome, to drive the two trades for Heaven and Earth ſo, as that one ſhall not intrench
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98733:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon another; for a man to pray ſo as that it may be ſaid he prayes <hi>continually</hi>; and for a man to follow his calling ſo, as that it may be ſaid, he followes his calling <hi>continually.</hi> In that he offered ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as oft as his ſonnes did feaſt; Obſerve this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the heart of man is continually evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doe not thinke that one ſacrifice will ſerve the heart of man, when it hath failed once in a duty, and thou haſt humbled thy ſoule for that, thinke not thus, now my heart will forbeare, when I come to ſuch a duty or to ſuch a buſineſſe again, now I have taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with my heart, I need not feare any more; no, <hi>the heart will ſinne over the ſame ſinne a thouſand times,</hi> it will ſinne continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. You ſee here <hi>Iob</hi> ſacrificing every time his ſonnes feaſted, he knew their hearts were apt to conceive thoſe ſinnes at any time, therefore he ſeekes God for them at all times.</p>
               <p>Further Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That renewed ſinnes muſt have renewed repentance.</hi> Thus did <hi>Job</hi> continually. Till you have done ſinning you muſt never give over repenting. If there be a leake in the Ship that lets in the water continually, the Pumpe muſt worke continually to carry it out: We are leaking veſſels all of us, ſinne commeth in, ſin is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, there muſt be the pump of repentance to cary it out againe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We may note this; <hi>Iob</hi> did it continually, <hi>Job was not good by fits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which a man doth out of conſcience, he will doe with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nature will have <hi>good moods,</hi> but <hi>grace is steady.</hi> Thus did <hi>Job</hi> continually, whatſoever his affaires or buſineſſes were, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was laid by, he would not lay by this duty of ſacrificing.</p>
               <p>Let this ſuffice for the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe,</hi> containing the care of <hi>Job</hi> over the ſoules of his children.

               </list>
               <p>Secondly, We have the materiall cauſe of <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction, or in what matter he was afflicted; and that is laid downe; firſt <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>All that he hath is in thy power</hi>; that is,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98733:45"/>
his outward eſtate, that was the matter wherein he was afflicted. Then it is laid downe <hi>negatively</hi>; in thoſe words, <hi>Only upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe put not forth thy hand.</hi> God doth ſet him out how farre the affliction ſhall go; in the things that he hath thou ſhalt afflict him, but thou ſhalt not meddle with his perſon, with his body or with his ſoule.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>finall cauſe of</hi> Jobs <hi>affliction,</hi> and that is, the practicall and experimentall determination, deciſion or ſtating of a great queſtion that was betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> concerning <hi>Jobs</hi> ſincerity. God tells Satan that <hi>Job</hi> was a good and a juſt man; Satan he denies it, and ſaith that <hi>Job</hi> was an hypocrite. Now the determination of this queſtion was the generall <hi>finall cauſe</hi> of <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction. When on the one ſide God affirmes it, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide Satan denies: how ſhall it be tryed? Who ſhall be the <hi>Moderatour</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire</hi> between them? Satan will not believe God, and God had no reaſon to believe Satan: How then ſhould this be made out? It is as if Satan had ſaid, <hi>Here is your yea and my nay, this queſtion will never be ended or decided betweene us, unleſſe you will admit ſome courſe to have</hi> Job <hi>ſoundly afflicted. This will quickly diſcover what metall the man is made of; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him come to the tryall,</hi> ſaith <hi>Satan. Let him, ſaith God, behold all that he hath is in thy power, doe thy worſt to him, onely upon his perſon put not forth thy hand.</hi> So that I ſay the generall finall cauſe of <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction is the determination of the queſtion, the deciſion of the diſpute betweene God and Satan, whether <hi>Job</hi> was a ſincere and holy man or no.</p>
               <p>And all this (to give you the ſumme of thoſe 6. verſes a little further,) is here ſet forth and deſcribed unto us after the manner of men, by an <hi>Anthropopathie:</hi> which is, when God expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his actions and diſpenſations with and toward the world, as if he were a man. So God doth here, he preſents himſelfe in this buſineſſe after the manner of ſome <hi>great King</hi> ſitting upon his Throne, having his ſervants attending him, and taking an account of them, what they had done, or giving Inſtructions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to them what they ſhall doe. This I ſay God doth here after the manner of men, for otherwiſe we are not to conceive that God doth make certaine dayes of Seſſion with his creatures, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he doth call the good and bad Angels together about the affaires of the world; we muſt not have ſuch groſſe conceits of God, for he needs receive no information from them, neither doth he give
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98733:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them or Satan any formall Commiſſion; neither is Satan admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the preſence of God, to come ſo neare God at any time; neither is God moved at all by the ſlanders of Satan, or by his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations to deliver up his ſervants and children into his hands for a moment. But onely the Scripture ſpeakes thus, to teach us how God carries himſelfe in the affaires of the world, even as if he ſate upon his throne, and call'd every creature before him, and gave each a direction, what and when and where to worke, how farre and which way to move in every action.</p>
               <p>So that theſe 6. verſes following, which containe the cauſes of <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction are (as we may ſo ſpeake) the <hi>Scheme or draught of providence</hi>; (that may be the title of them.) If a man would <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineat providence,</hi> he might doe it thus; ſuppoſe God upon his throne, with Angels good and bad, yea all creatures about him, and he directing, ſending, ordering every one, as a Prince doth his Subjects, or as a Maſter his ſervants, doe you this and doe you that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo all is ordered according to his <hi>Dictate.</hi> Thus all things in Heaven and Earth are diſpoſed of by the unerring wiſdome, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the Almighty power of God.</p>
               <p>Such a repreſentation as this we reade in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.19. Where <hi>Micaiah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ahab, Heare thou the word of the Lord, I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon his throne, and all the Hoaſt of Heaven ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by him.</hi> And ſo he goeth on to ſhew how a ſpirit came and offered himſelfe to be a <hi>lying spirit</hi> in the mouth of <hi>Ahabs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> This is only a ſhadow of providence; there was no ſuch thing really acted, God did not conveene or call together a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of ſpirits to adviſe with (<hi>de Arduis Regni</hi>) about hard or doubtfull caſes; nor are wicked ſpirits admitted into his preſence, onely by this we are inſtructed and aſſured that God doth as exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order all things in Heaven and earth, as if he ſtood queſtioning or interrogating good Angels, men and devills concerning thoſe matters.</p>
               <p>Having thus given ſome light about theſe ſix verſes in generall. I ſhall open the particulars.</p>
               <q>Now there was a day.</q>
               <p>The Jewiſh Rabbins trouble themſelves much to find out what day this was. They ſay it was the firſt day of the yeare. Others that it was the Sabbath day. But I account it a diſadvantage to a cleare truth when it is proved by an obſcure text. The Sabbath hath
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98733:46"/>
proofe enough before the law, though this be ſpared. The holy Ghoſt hath told us only that there was a day, or certain time.</p>

Some it may be will object againſt this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that of the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5: <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, thou art my ſonne?</hi> How then doe you inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret here,<note place="margin">Reade more of this point Chap. 2.1. where the whole verſe is repeated.</note> that the ſons of God are the Angels, when as the Apoſtle hath expreſt, to which of the Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer that the <hi>Angells</hi> are not the <hi>ſonnes of God,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there expreſſeth, they are <hi>not the ſonnes of God</hi> by <hi>eternall Generation</hi>; but they are the <hi>ſonnes of God</hi> by <hi>temporall Creation,</hi> for ſo he ſpeakes there, <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he, thou art my ſonne this day have I begotten thee?</hi> They are not the <hi>begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſonnes of God,</hi> but they are the <hi>created ſonnes of God.</hi> And the <hi>Angels</hi> are called the <hi>ſons of God</hi> in 3 reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe of their great and mighty power, therefore <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21. they are called, <hi>Principalities and powers; far above prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, and might and dominions,</hi> that is, farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Angels. They are called the <hi>ſonnes of God,</hi> becauſe they are like God in power and dignity.</p>
               <p>Then againe they are called <hi>the ſonnes of God,</hi> becauſe they ſerve God as <hi>ſonnes,</hi> chearfully, willingly, readily. They do not obey as ſlaves, as ſervants, as the beſt of ſervants, they obey better than the beſt of ſervants, they obey <hi>as children:</hi> they goe about their worke with <hi>filiall and ſonne-like</hi> chearfullnes and delight.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they are called <hi>ſonnes,</hi> becauſe of the great <hi>priviledge</hi> that God doth vouchſafe them, he doth uſe them as his children, as his <hi>ſonnes,</hi> they are his <hi>Courtiers,</hi> they are neare him alwaies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him, and continually ſee his face. They have the priviledge of <hi>ſonnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Came to preſent themſelves before the Lord.</q>
               <p>Not that the <hi>Angels</hi> are at any time out of the preſence of God, for Chriſt is expreſſe in that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. <hi>Their Angels doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes behold the face of my Father.</hi> But they are then ſaid to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98733:46"/>
come and preſent themſelves before God, when they come upon ſome ſpeciall buſineſſe, or upon ſome ſpeciall occaſion. As it is with us here upon the Earth, we are never out of the preſence of God, for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>Whether ſhall I goe from thy preſence?</hi> Yet when we come to pray and are in other holy duties we are ſaid <hi>to preſent our ſelves before God, and to draw neare unto God, and God is ſaid to draw neare unto us</hi> at ſuch a time, and yet God is ever with us, and we ever with him. So when it is ſaid here, that the <hi>Angels came and preſented themſelves before the Lord,</hi> it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth only this, their readineſſe, either to give an account of what they had done, or to receive directions from God what to doe. The Angels are moſt willing to goe about the ſervice and worke of God, and that is all that is here meant by their preſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Lord, for otherwiſe they are ever in his preſence: as Luk. 1.19. <hi>The Angell anſwered and ſaid, I am</hi> Gabriel <hi>that ſtand in the preſence of God, and am ſent to speake unto thee.</hi> I am <hi>Gabriel</hi> that ſtand, he ſpeakes in the preſent time, even now while I am ſpeaking unto thee, <hi>I ſtand in the preſence of God.</hi> The Angell while he goeth into the world, is not abſent from God, he beholdeth the face of <hi>God alwayes.</hi> The Schoole-men have an odde diſtinction, they ſay there are <hi>aſſisting Angels</hi> and there are <hi>ministring Angels:</hi> Thoſe Angels that are aſſiſtants ſtand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before God and never are ſent out about the world upon any occaſion; Others are miniſtring ſpirits, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Are they not miniſtring spirits ſent forth to miniſter for them who are the heires of ſalvation?</hi> This is Schoole doctrine. But there needs no ſuch diſtinction of ſome to be aſſiſting or attending and ſome to be miniſtring Angels, for whereſoever they are, they are alwayes in the preſence of God: and their preſenting themſelves before God, notes only their preparedneſſe to attend the Lords ſervice in whatſoever he ſhall employ them.</p>
               <q>And Satan came alſo among them.</q>
               <p>That is, the chief of the evill Angels, as it is conceived. The word [<hi>Satan</hi>] ſignifieth an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> and ſo it is often times applied to men; as concerning <hi>Solomon,</hi> it is ſaid that while he did walke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly with God, <hi>there was neither adverſary nor evill occurrant</hi>;<note place="margin">1 King. 5.4.</note> the word in the originall is, there was no <hi>Satan</hi> in his kingdome; and in the 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.14. it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſtirred up Satan an Adverſary againſt</hi> Solomon; and that accuſation which thoſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98733:47"/>
wretches in <hi>Ezra</hi> c. 4. ſent againſt the building of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is called <hi>Sitna,</hi> they ſent <hi>Sitna</hi> an accuſation or an oppoſing letter: It comes from the ſame root, any kind of oppoſition is called <hi>Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> from Satan who is an oppoſer. It is ſometimes uſed more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally concerning any oppoſition, as the Angell that came to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Baalam,</hi> Numb. 22.34. <hi>I wiſt not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Baalam) that there was an adverſary that ſtood in the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how can it be ſaid that Satan ſhould come among the ſons of God?</p>
               <p>I ſaid before that it was but an alluding ſpeech to the dealings of men in their ſeſſions and aſſemblies, and there is no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make every particular of it hold. Wee may conceive it thus.</p>
               <q>Satan came alſo among them.</q>
               <p>It is not ſaid that the ſons of God and Satan, came and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves before the Lord; Satan did not joyne himſelfe in with them. Satan did not offer himſelfe for any good ſervice: but thither hee came being ſo ordered by the over-ruling power of God.</p>
               <p>But can Satan come into the preſence of God?</p>
               <p>No otherwiſe than a blind man can come into the Sun: he comes into the Sun and the Sun ſhineth upon him, but he ſees not the Sun. Satan comes ſo into the preſence of God, that he is alwayes ſeene of God, he is never ſo in the preſence of God as to ſee God. It is queſtion'd whether the lapſed Angels ever ſaw God at all while they ſtood; becauſe if they had ſeene God, it is conceived that viſion would have been their confirmation. But it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the lapſed <hi>Angels</hi> ſince their fall never ſaw <hi>God,</hi> nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall; though it be ſaid here Satan came among the <hi>ſons of God</hi>; you know what the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> teacheth, <hi>That the devils kept not their place, but are reſerved in chaines of darkneſſe againſt the judgement of the great day</hi>; We ſhall open that afterward, when we come to ſpeake of his compaſſing the earth, how he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the earth, and yet is reſerved in chaines of darkneſſe. But I ſay there is his ſeat, there is his place, and all that is ſpoken of him in this doth not inferre any the leaſt glimpſe or fruition of God or communion with the Angels. In regard of his nature, he is ſtill a ſpirit; but in regard of his ſin, he is a miſerable ſpirit, he hath loſt his excellency, though he hath not loſt his nature. And being a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98733:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpirit, he hath power to paſſe and repaſſe, to goe up and downe the world, to aſcend and deſcend at his pleaſure (as good Angels may and can) when God doth permit him.</p>
               <p>We ſee here the good Angels are called the <hi>ſons of God</hi>; in this learne the priviledge of beleevers, they partake with the Angels in this title; the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath ſhewed that we ſhould be called the ſonnes of God</hi>; if you would know what manner of love it is, it is as great as the Angels in Heaven have: Chriſt tooke not upon him the nature of Angels but hath given us the honour of Angels. Fallen Angels could not ſhare with us in the benefit of redemption, but we ſhare with the Angels that ſtand in the priviledge of Son-ſhip. We are the ſons of God as well as they, and in ſomewhat beyond them; they are created ſons, but not (as we) adopted ſons.</p>
               <q>Came and preſented themſelves before God.</q>
               <p>This ſhould teach us <hi>to imitate Angels</hi>; this we pray for, <hi>That the will of God ſhould be done on Earth, as it is done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> The Angels alwayes preſent themſelves, they alwayes ſtand before God, ready to doe his will; we ſhould be ever in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in this ſenſe, that is, preſenting our ſelves, ſtanding as in the preſence of God, ready to take and receive inſtruction, to doe his will, what ever it is. <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Is as it were the voyce of an Angell ſtanding before the throne of God. It ſhould be the voyce of every ſoul, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> This is the preſenting of the ſoule before God.</p>
               <p>Then conſider here, who Satan was; Satan was as good in his Creation, as any of thoſe who are called <hi>the ſonnes of God,</hi> They are called the <hi>ſonnes of God,</hi> and he is now called nothing but <hi>Satan</hi> an adverſary. His condition was once as good as theirs. Note hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is no created excellency, but if it be left to it ſelfe, will quickly undoe it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Angels were as good at the firſt as any of thoſe that were here called the <hi>ſonnes of God.</hi> They were not confirmed, they ſtood upon their owne bottome, they fell and had no tempter at all; they turned about upon the freedome of their owne will, and <hi>left their habitation</hi> (ſaith the Scripture.) <hi>There is no truſting to any eſtate out of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further note this, what was the difference between thoſe <hi>ſons of God</hi> and this <hi>Satan?</hi> only ſin: one was as good as the other in the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98733:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
creation; nothing elſe made an Angell a Devill, but only ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sin despoyles the creature of all it's comfort and honour at once.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe note this, the Angell falling and becomming ſinfull, hath his name preſently changed, he is called <hi>Satan</hi> an <hi>Adverſary.</hi> An <hi>adverſary</hi> to God, an <hi>adverſary</hi> to man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that is wicked himſelfe will quickly be an adverſary, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of all goodneſſe: no ſooner a ſinner, but a Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Note this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To be an oppoſer of good is to be conformable to the devill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The devill is the Adverſary, the Satan, and ſo proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as any one is an oppoſer of good, ſo much of Satan, ſo much of the devill he hath in him: Therefore Chriſt ſaid to a <hi>chiefe Apoſtle,</hi> when he did oppoſe him in that greateſt good of all, <hi>the working out of our redemption in dying for us, get thee behind me Satan,</hi> Mat. 16. <hi>All oppoſition of goodneſſe is a spice of the devill.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13.10. when he ſpeakes to <hi>Elymas the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer,</hi> ſaith, <hi>O thou child of the devill, thou enemy of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> To be an enemy of goodneſſe is to be the child of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; it is the very character of the devill. He is a Satan in reſpect of all goodneſſe and good perſons.</p>
               <p>And ſurely (my brethren) if this be a character of the devill, and to be conformable unto Satan, how conſpicuous is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in this age? How many thouſands beare this <hi>marke of the devill,</hi> not only in their <hi>hands</hi> cloſely, but in their <hi>fore-heads</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly? How many <hi>viſible walking Satans</hi> are there among us, enemies of all goodneſſe, oppreſſours of all righteouſneſſe, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of our peace, oppoſers of our liberty, oppoſers of the Goſpell, oppoſers of Chriſt? Theſe are all as ſo many Satans in the world, ſo many enemies. Now is a time that <hi>Satans</hi> are let looſe in the world; the devill now if ever <hi>workes mightily in the hearts and spirits,</hi> in the hands and tongues of theſe <hi>children of diſobedience.</hi> It becommeth us then, that as there are many adverſaries and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of goodneſſe, to ſhew our ſelves friends and patrons of goodneſſe. Chriſt hath many challenges, let him find ſome Champions. Now it is time to raiſe your ſpirits, not only to love the truth, but to maintaine the truth; <hi>as it is the height of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, not onely to doe evill, but to oppoſe good, ſo it is the height of holineſſe, not only to doe good, but to oppoſe evill.</hi> This is juſt to be on the contrary point to Satan, he doth wickedneſſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98733:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and oppoſeth good, let us doe good and oppoſe all evill, <hi>To be a Satan against Satan, is the glory of a Chriſtian.</hi> Now ſet your ſelves againſt the Sathans, be adverſaries to that Adverſary and all his adherents, ſo ſhall you approve your ſelves the friends of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>In the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> we have the firſt quſtion, the Lord beginneth with Sathan, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, whence commest thou?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How the <hi>Lord ſpeakes</hi> is a point almoſt <hi>unſpeakeable.</hi> There are many diſputes about it, I will not ſtay upon them: only to open this, that you may take in all Scripture of the like kind wherein the Lord is ſaid to ſpeake. We muſt know that as in Scripture God is ſaid to have <hi>a mouth</hi> and a voice, alluding unto man by that common <hi>figure</hi>; ſo likewiſe when the <hi>Lord</hi> ſpeakes we muſt underſtand it by the ſame figure, it is but an alluſion to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men. God is ſaid to ſpeake, as men are ſaid to ſpeake: but God doth not ſpeake, as men ſpeake, forming a voice by ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans or inſtruments of ſpeech: But when the <hi>Lord</hi> ſpeakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98733:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
either by <hi>forming and creating</hi> a voice in the <hi>ayre,</hi> ſo God is ſaid to ſpeake ſometimes, As when Chriſt was <hi>babtized,</hi> there <hi>came a voice from Heaven ſaying,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my beloved Sonne,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.28. <hi>There came a voice from Heaven ſaying, I have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified thee</hi>; which all the people heard ſounding in the ayre. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to ſpeake, when he manifeſts and declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe either to the <hi>ſpirits of men,</hi> or unto <hi>Angels</hi> who are ſpirits. God doth ſpeake unto the ſpirits of men, ſometimes without any forming of a voice: ſo the phraſe is uſuall in the Prophets, <hi>The word of the Lord came unto me,</hi> which is to be underſtood, that the Lord did ſecretly reveale himſelfe to the ſpirits of his Prophets, and not by any externall <hi>audible</hi> voice; it was an inward, not an outward word. So when the Lord ſpeakes unto Spirits or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, be they good or evill Angels, you muſt not underſtand it of a voice formed or faſhioned into audible words and ſyllables, but it is a manifeſtation or a declaration of Gods will and mind unto the Angels mind, good or bad as God willeth. For the will of God to declare himſelfe unto an Angell, is the ſpeech of God unto an Angell. So much as God intendeth of his mind ſhould be known to the Devill, is a ſpeaking to the Devill. The intention of one ſpirit is as plaine to another ſpirit, as the voice of one man is to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, there is the very ſame proportion. So here in this place where it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord ſaid unto Sathan,</hi> this was only a manifeſtation of Gods will, as he willed unto Sathan; God did manifeſt himſelfe thus farre to Satan, that it was his pleaſure to know of him whence he came; this will, was his ſpeech.</p>
               <p>To paſſe from the manner of ſpeaking, we will looke upon the matter ſpoken, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Sathan, whence comeſt thou?</hi> That's the firſt queſtion.</p>
               <p>This queſtion is here put, not for information, as if the Lord did not know whence he came, as men uſually queſtion that they may be informed. But queſtions in Scripture (eſpecially when the Lord putteth them) are to be underſtood in ſome of theſe ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt to exact a confeſſion from the mouth of the party. He ſaid unto Sathan <hi>whence comest thou?</hi> Not that he needed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but that he might receive a confeſſion from the mouth of Sathan. So he queſtioned <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3. Adam <hi>where art thou? who told thee that thou wast naked? Haſt thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee thou ſhouldeſt not eate?</hi> Theſe queſtions were not to informe God, but only that <hi>Adam</hi> might
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98733:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
give a confeſſion out of his owne mouth concerning thoſe things. So he queſtioned <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. <hi>Where is</hi> Abel <hi>thy brother?</hi> It was a queſtion only to draw a confeſſion from <hi>Cain</hi> of what he had done. There is a like queſtion of <hi>Eliſha</hi> to his ſervant <hi>Gebazi</hi> when he had runne after <hi>Naaman</hi> and had got a reward from him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaith to him, <hi>whence commest thou?</hi> or where haſt thou bin? He asked him this only to draw a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from him, for ſaith he afterward, <hi>went not my ſpirit with thee when the man turned againe from his charet to meete thee?</hi> He knew before where his ſervant had beene, God had revealed the thing unto him, only he queſtions him to make him acknowledge it. So here the Lord queſtions Satan, <hi>whence commest thou?</hi> that he might have a confeſſion from himſelfe. <hi>Though the Lord doth know all the actions wayes and thoughts of every creature, yet God at the laſt will question every man, that he may judge every man upon his owne confeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this queſtion may be underſtood, as intimating a diſlike of the thing or of the buſineſſe that Sathan had beene about. Queſtions are many times put, not out of ignorance or neſcience of what hath bin done, but out of a diſlike or abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the thing done. When the man or the thing is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, then God carrieth himſelfe toward him and his action as if he knew not what he had bin doing, and he muſt have it out by confeſſion. Thus <hi>Hiram,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9.13. puts the queſtion upon Solomon, <hi>What Cities are theſe which thou hast given me my brother?</hi> He ſaw and knew before what Cities they were, but thus he queſtion'd, <hi>becauſe they pleaſed him not,</hi> verſ. 12. In the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. God is ſaid not to know that they ſet up Kings; <hi>They have ſet up Kings but not by me, they have made Princes and I knew it not:</hi> That is, I did not like them, I tooke no notice of them by way of approbation. So God queſtions about things, as if he did not know them, when he doth not like them; and we may conclude that this queſtion holds out to us Gods diſlike of the wayes and workes or Sathan.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Queſtions and this queſtion may be underſtood in a way of <hi>objurgation</hi> or chiding. <hi>Sathan whence commest thou?</hi> Thou haſt beene a tempting, thou art come now from murthers, and thefts, and adulteries, and blaſphemies, from provoking men to all theſe wickedneſſes.

thou?</hi> As many times when you are angry with your ſervants, you aske, <hi>where have you been?</hi> There is a reprehenſion in the queſtion: So God full of wrath toward Sathan, ſaith, <hi>whence commest thou? Thou hast beene doing all the miſchiefe thou canſt abroad in the world I am ſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, For the better conceiving of the matter of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propoſed, <hi>whence commeſt thou?</hi> There is more to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood then is expreſſed, For God doth not only inquire here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>places</hi> where he had bin, but concerning the <hi>buſines</hi> and the work w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he had done, all is included in it. <hi>Whence comeſt thou?</hi> what haſt thou bin doing in the world? what hath thy buſineſſe bin abroad? Every man, every creature, every Angell good or bad, muſt give an account of themſelves unto God. So much of the Lords queſtion, now let us examine Sathans anſwer.</p>
               <q>Then Sathan anſwered the Lord and ſaid, from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and downe in it.</q>
               <p>If I am enquired (ſaith Sathan) whence I come, I anſwer, <hi>I come from walking up and downe in the earth, from going to and fro in it.</hi> Here againe it may be doubted, How Sathan ſpeakes to the Lord, as before it was about the Lords ſpeaking unto Sathan. The ſpeaking of Sathan and all ſpirits, is according to the manner before explained of Gods ſpeaking. Then Angells ſpeake one to another or unto God, when they direct or intend ſuch or ſuch things to be known. As a thought, a conception in the mind, is a word in the mind; ſo the directing or putting forth, or an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to put forth that word or that thought, is the ſpeaking of the mind, then the mind ſpeakes. As we know in our ſelves, A man meditates he conceives ſuch and ſuch things, he formes them all in his ſpirit under ſome words into ſuch notions: And he can put forth theſe by deſires, though he doth not ſpeake. And ſo we are ſaid often in Scripture to ſpeake unto God in our hearts, when the mouth doth not ſpeake at all, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 14.15. <hi>is ſaid to cry unto God,</hi> that was nothing but the directing or actuall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſuch and ſuch ſecret deſires unto God; that was a crying unto God. So it is ſaid of <hi>Hannah,</hi> (1 Sam. 1.13.) <hi>that ſhe ſpake to the Lord in her heart.</hi> After this manner doe Angels and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſpeake. As we can ſpeake to God in our ſpirits, by our hearts, when we intend or lift up ſuch and ſuch thoughts unto God; ſo they ſpeake in the ſame manner by making knowne and revealing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98733:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo much of their minds to God, as they deſire he ſhould take notice of: For if a man have ſuch and ſuch thoughts, and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them to himſelfe, he is ſaid to ſpeake to himſelfe, to ſpeake within himſelfe: So Angels, though they have ſuch and ſuch thoughts, they do ſpeake to themſelves, and not to God, while they keepe thoſe thoughts within themſelves: how ever God knowes them all before, yet an Angell is ſaid to ſpeake no more to God, then he doth intentionally and obedientially (as ſome expreſſe it) make knowne and declare to God his deſire, that God may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it. So here Sathan anſwereth and ſaith unto God, or he ſpeakes to God theſe things, that is, he doth actually intend that God ſhould know thus much of him what he had beene about, that he was come now, <hi>from going to and fro in the earth, from walking up and dawne in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>From going to and fro, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>It may be doubted, how Sathan can be ſaid to <hi>goe to and fro in the earth, and to walke up and downe in it,</hi> whereas it is expreſſe in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>that the Angels which kept not their first estate, but left their owne habitation, he hath reſerved in everlasting chaines under darkneſſe unto the judgement of the great day.</hi> Now if Sathan, if the Angels that fell be in <hi>chaines,</hi> and in <hi>chaines of everlaſting darkeneſſe,</hi> and reſerved unto the judgement of the great day, how doth Sathan here ſpeake of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as being at liberty, going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and downe in it?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That though the devill goeth up and downe, yet he is ever in <hi>chaines.</hi> He is in a <hi>double chaine,</hi> even when he goes and circuits the whole earth abroad, he is in a <hi>chaine of Justice,</hi> and in a <hi>chaine of Providence.</hi> He is in a chaine of Juſtice, that is, under the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> and he is in a chaine of Providence, that is, under the <hi>eye of God,</hi> he can goe no further then God gives him leave, then God lets out and lengthens his chaine. So that ſtill he is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under chaines, even chaines of darkneſſe, when he goes abroad he goes like a priſoner with his fetters upon his heeles.</p>
               <p>But it may be here enquired further, if Sathan be thus under the wrath of God, and be a condemned ſpirit, if he be in ſuch darkneſſe, how can he intend or attempt, plot or execute thoſe deſignes of temptation for the overthrow of ſoules, and diſturbance of the Churches of God throughout the world. Will not ſuch torment
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98733:51"/>
and horrour of darkeneſſe, diſable and unfit him for ſuch curious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of doing miſchiefe? can he have his thoughts upon any thing but upon his own wofull condition and miſerable eſtate?</p>
               <p>For this likewiſe (to cleare it) we may conceive, that Sathan although he be at the preſent under the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> yet he is not under the fullneſſe of the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> he is not yet in <hi>extremity,</hi> he is not yet in that <hi>degree</hi> of judgement which hereafter he ſhall receive. Sathan is now as full of <hi>diſcontent</hi> as he can be, but he is not ſo full of <hi>torment</hi> as he can be, This we ſee expreſly in <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29. where the devils ſay to Chriſt, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> as noting that there will be a time wherein they ſhall have more torment, their fill of torment; ſuch torment, as what they now endure, compared with it, may paſſe for no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if not for pleaſure. Then they ſhall drinke the very dreggs of the cup of Gods wrath, now they doe (as it were) but ſip or taſte it. The devils, though they are already caſt downe from their glorious eſtate, yet they are not caſt into ſuch a wofull ſtate as hereafter they ſhall be; therefore they may walke up and downe in the world, and unceſſantly ſet themſelves about the deſtruction of others.</p>

               <p>Theſe expreſſions are not to be underſtood properly, for proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirits, ſuch as Sathan is, cannot be ſaid <hi>to goe or to walke: A ſpirit moveth,</hi> that is proper to a ſpirit: but properly a ſpirit doth not walke or goe, that is proper only to bodies: But the word which we tranſlate, <hi>from going to and fro,</hi> is tranſlated by ſome, <hi>from compaſſing the earth,</hi> or <hi>from compaſſing about in the world,</hi> and then it is proper;<note place="margin">

               <p>Further, For the underſtanding of <hi>Satans going to and fro in the earth.</hi> We muſt not not conceive that this is all that Satan doth, to walke up and down in the world, to go to and fro: he is no idle peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticke,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98733:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but by going to and fro in the earth is noted.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The exact diſcovery which Sathan makes of all things in the earth. For the word [<hi>Shut</hi>] ſignifieth to enquire, to ſearch diligently into a thing. It is not a bare going about,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propriè eſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentè diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicere &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorare.</hi>
                  </note> but it is a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about as a ſpie, to ſearch, to enquire, to obſerve and conſider diligently all things as one paſſeth along. The ſame word is uſed (<hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4.) for diſcourſing, we tranſlate it thus, <hi>Many ſhall run to and fro and knowledge ſhall be increaſed:</hi> now, we may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how knowledge ſhould be increaſed by running to and fro, up and downe, they that would increaſe knowledge, ſhould rather ſit ſtill and conſider, and debate things; but the word (ſo ſome tranſlate it) ſignifies to diſcourſe or diſpute of things, they ſhall diſcourſe or goe about to enquire into things and knowledge ſhall be increaſed. Thus Sathans going to and fro in the earth, is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing upon every thing, a diſputing upon every point and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: he doth as it were debate every mans condition as he goeth, and every mans eſtate, every mans temper, and every mans cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he conſiders what is fitteſt to be done againſt him, and how he may aſſault him with greateſt advantage. That is the running or going to and fro which is here meant in the Text, it is a going to and fro to increaſe his knowledge, and informe himſelfe of all things as he goeth. The ſame word is uſed concerning the good Angels, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.10. It is ſaid there, that they were ſent <hi>to walke to and fro through the earth</hi>; it was not a bare paſſing through the earth, but a curious obſerving and prying into all things as they went: we tranſlate it a walking to and fro, but it is a walking ſo as to bring God in intelligence, for theſe were ſent out as Chriſts intelligencers, to bring him in a report of the ſtate of things abroad: for ſo there in the viſion it is expreſt after the manner of men; Though Chriſt needs none to informe him about the eſtate of his Church and people, yet he alludes to the cuſtome of Princes, who maintaine Intelligencers in all Courts and Kingdomes, to adviſe them how the affaires of other nations are tranſacted. The very ſame Originall word is uſed of God himſelfe, (<hi>Zach.</hi> 4.10.) <hi>The eyes of the Lord runne to and fro through the whole earth,</hi> he is his own Intelligencer, exactly diſcovering and taking notice of every thing that is done in the world. So then this is the meaning, I have beene <hi>going to and fro in the earth, ſaith Satan,</hi> that is, I have fully and throughly taken notice of all paſſages, of all perſons in all places, of all conditions and ſorts of men, that is the thing I
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98733:52"/>
have beene doing; Thus M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Broughton</hi> tranſlates, <hi>From ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to and fro in the earth,</hi> noting his exactneſſe of enquiry in his travels.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, it noteth the <hi>unquietnes of Satan.</hi> He is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, a reſtleſſe ſpirit, being caſt out of Heaven he can reſt no where. A ſoule that is once diſplaced and out of the favour of God, hath no place to repoſe in afterward. Now ſaith he, all my buſineſſe is walking to and fro, going up and downe, <hi>Satan hath no rest.</hi> As the ſentence of <hi>Cain</hi> was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. when God had caſt him out of his <hi>preſence, thou ſhalt be a fugitive and a vagabond,</hi> thou ſhalt doe nothing but runne up and downe the world as long as thou liveſt. Satan is ſuch a fugitive, a vagabond, one that runnes up and downe in the world, he is an unſetled, an unquiet ſpirit. <hi>They who are once departed from God, can never find rest in any creature,</hi> but running to and fro is their condition and their curſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Some underſtand it thus, that Satan makes (as it were) a recreation of his tempting and drawing men to Hell. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan cannot poſſibly in a proper ſenſe, take any comfort or be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, but as one doth well expreſſe it, he himſelfe being loſt, undone and damned, ſeekes to comfort himſelfe by undoing and damning others.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ipſe perditus perdendis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia quaerit.</hi>
                  </note> It is a joy to ſome to have companions in ſorrow. All Satans delight (if we may conceive he hath any delight) is in this, in making others as bad and miſerable as himſelfe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be he calls his trade of ſeduction and deſtruction, <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up and downe in the earth,</hi> as men are ſaid to walke up and downe for refreſhing and recreation; he ſpeakes of it, not as of ſome toileſome hard journy, but as of walking for delight. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the former to be more proper.</p>
               <p>Take two or three Notes from this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Here we may obſerve, <hi>That there is no place in the world that can ſecure a man from temptation, or be a ſanctuary from Satans aſſault.</hi> For Satan goeth to and fro thorough the earth, hee is an ubiquitary, hee ſtayes no where but runs every where. It is the folly of <hi>Popiſh Votaries,</hi> that think to ſhut themſelves up in walls from the temptations of <hi>Satan</hi>; Cloyſters are as open to Satan as the open field. <hi>Satan walketh to and fro through the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We may note here <hi>the wonderfull diligence of Satan, Satan is very active to doe miſchiefe,</hi> He walketh to and fro, As
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98733:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth it, 2 Pet. 5.8. <hi>He goeth about as a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devoure.</hi> There is his diligence, and there is his intent. Satan ſpeaks nothing of his intent here, he conceales that, he ſpeakes only as if he went about like a pilgrim walking thorough the earth, his maine buſineſſe, that he went about, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure ſoules is kept in ſilence; but the holy Ghoſt unmaskes him and diſcovers the deſigne of his walking to and fro, <hi>He ſeeks whom he may devoure.</hi> If Satan be thus diligent going about to tempt, we ought to be as diligent ſtanding alwayes upon our watch, to prevent his temptations. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Latimer</hi> in one of his Sermons, where he taxes the Clergy, eſpecially the Biſhops of thoſe times for their idleneſſe, propoſeth to them the example of the Prophets and Apoſtles and of Chriſt himſelfe, their diligence in going about to preach ſhould quicken thoſe idlers: but (ſaith he) if you will not follow their example, follow the example of Satan, he goeth about in his <hi>Dioceſſe</hi> to and fro continually. Take example from him in doing evill, how to doe good, we may take example thus farre from Satan, to be as forward to do good, as he is to do hurt, to be as watchfull againſt him as he is watchfull againſt us. If this be his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines to go to and fro thorough the earth and his intent be to devour ſouls, then where ever we goe in the world up and downe, we ought to be carefull to keep our own ſouls, and gain the ſouls of others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We may obſerve from it, that Satan is confined in his buſineſſe to the earth, he can get no farther than the earth or to the ayereall part; he is called the <hi>Prince of the ayre.</hi> Satan being once caſt out of heaven can never get into Heaven more. There is no tempter in heaven, there is no <hi>Serpent</hi> ſhall ever come into the <hi>caeleſtiall Paradiſe</hi>; there was one in the earthly Paradiſe, but there ſhall never be any in the caeleſtiall. Therefore when we are once beyond the earth, we are beyond the reach of all temptations, we are then at reſt from Satans ſnares and practices, as well as from our owne labours.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider what the Lord replyeth, or his ſecond Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to Satan. Well, thou haſt been walking to and fro in the earth, ſaith God, <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job? Tell me, haſt thou taken notice of ſuch an one? <hi>Haſt thou conſidered?</hi> The word is, <hi>Haſt thou put thy heart upon</hi> Job?<note place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> So it is word for word in the Originall, haſt thou laid <hi>Job</hi> to thy heart? Haſt thou ſeriouſly, fully and exactly conſidered my ſervant <hi>Job?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Iuſt.</hi>
                  </note> And ſo it is rendred out of the <hi>Septuagint, Hast thou attended with thy
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98733:53"/>
mind upon my ſervant</hi> Job? To put a thing upon the heart, is to have ſerious and ſpeciall regard to it; as when the Scripture ſpeaks of not putting a thing upon the heart, it noteth a ſleighting and neglecting of it. When the wife of <hi>Phineas</hi> was delivered, and they told her that ſhe had brought forth a ſon, the Text ſaith, <hi>ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.20.</note> 
                  <hi>neither did ſhe regard</hi>; the Hebrew is, <hi>neither did ſhe put her heart upon it,</hi> the ſame word is here in the Text. Thus <hi>Abigail</hi> ſpeakes unto <hi>David, As for this ſonne of</hi> Belial, <hi>let not my Lord put his heart upon him,</hi> or (as it is tranſlated) <hi>let not my Lord regard this man of</hi> Belial;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.25.</note> take no notice of ſuch an one as he is, <hi>he is a foole name and thing,</hi> doe not regard him, doe not put him upon thy heart. There are divers ſuch expreſſions where putting upon the heart is expreſſed by regarding, and not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the heart, by not regarding. Then here, haſt thou put <hi>Job</hi> upon thy heart? that is, haſt thou ſeriouſly weighed and conſidered <hi>Job?</hi> As if God had ſaid, <hi>I am ſure in thy travels and wandrings about the world, thou couldeſt not chooſe but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of</hi> Job, <hi>he is my jewell, my darling, a ſpeciall man among all the ſonnes of men: He is ſuch a spectacle as may juſtly draw all eyes and hearts after him: when thou walkedſt didst thou not make a ſtand at</hi> Jobs <hi>doore. I cannot but looke upon him my ſelfe and conſider him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 34 15.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore ſurely thou haſt conſidered him. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his heart is upon them too. A wicked man hath not the eye of God, a godly man hath his heart, and ſhall have it to all eternity.</hi> The ſumme is.</p>
               <p>This Queſtion teacheth us; <hi>That amongſt all the men that dwell on the face of the earth,</hi> Job <hi>was the moſt conſiderable.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant <hi>Job.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>It is as if one ſhould ſay to a man come from this City into the Countrey, were you at Court, or have you ſeen the King? Becauſe he is the moſt eminent and conſiderable perſon. So God here ſpeakes to Satan upon his account of walking about the earth, haſt thou taken notice of <hi>Job? A godly man is the most conſiderable man in the world.</hi> But then you <hi>muſt put your heart</hi> upon him, not your <hi>eye</hi> onely, for then as it was ſaid of Chriſt, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3.) you may perhaps <hi>ſee no beauty in him,</hi> his inſide is the moſt conſiderable thing in the world. As a wicked man is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, not worthy the looking unto, though he be never ſo great,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 3.14.</note> as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid to the King of <hi>Iſrael, Surely as the Lord of

hoſtes liveth, before whom I ſtand, were it not that I regard the preſence of</hi> Jehoſaphat <hi>the King of</hi> Judah, <hi>I would not looke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thee nor ſee thee</hi>; thou art not a man ſaith he, that deſerveth ſo much as to be looked upon;<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.4.</note> A godly man is therefore deſcribed to be one, in whoſe eyes a vile perſon, a wicked man, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, in reference to Satan. Some reade theſe words not by way of queſtion, but by way of affirmation; thus, thou haſt conſidered my ſervant <hi>Job.</hi> Thou haſt been abroad in the world, ſurely then thou haſt taken notice of my ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> thou haſt conſidered him; that is, of all men in the world, thou haſt ſet thy ſelfe about <hi>Job</hi> to tempt him and to try him, when thou cameſt to <hi>Jobs</hi> houſe, there thou madeſt an aſſault, there thou try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the uttermoſt of thy ſtrength to overcome him; thou conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redſt him what to do againſt him, how to overthrow him, &amp; tel me, haſt thou not found him a tuffe peece? Dideſt thou ever meet with ſuch an one in the world before? To conſider a thing is to try all wayes how to gaine it, or how to compaſſe ſuch a thing:<note place="margin">1 Sam 9.20.</note> as <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul</hi> when he was ſeeking his fathers Aſſes, <hi>As for thine Aſſes that were loſt, ſet not thy mind on them</hi>; that is, doe not trouble thy ſelfe, doe not beat thy braines to conſider which way to goe to find them, or where it is moſt probable to get them. So here thou haſt ſet thy mind or conſidered my ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> that is, thou haſt beat thy braines, and ſet all thy wits on worke what courſe to take with greateſt advantage to deſtroy my ſervant <hi>Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take the words in that ſenſe, and they yeeld us this Inſtruction. <hi>That Satans main temptations, his ſtrongeſt batteries are plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the moſt eminent godly perſons.</hi> When Satan ſees a man that is eminent in grace, againſt him he makes his hotteſt and ſubtileſt aſſaults: he ſets his heart upon ſuch a man, yea and vexeth his heart too about him. Satan is moſt buſie at holy duties (one ſaid he ſaw in a viſion ten devils at a Sermon, and but one at the market) and about holy perſons. As for others, he doth not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelfe about them, for they (as the Apoſtle ſhewes) <hi>are led captive by the devill at his will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> if he doe but <hi>whiſtle</hi> (as it were) they eaſily follow him and come after him preſently, ſo that he needs not ſet his heart or vex himſelfe about them. But when he commeth to a <hi>Job,</hi> he ſets all his wits and all his ſtrength a worke, bends all his thoughts to conſider what courſe to take to aſſault ſuch <hi>a ſtrong hold of grace.</hi> If he can get ſuch a man downe then there

is triumph indeed, <hi>he ſings victoria.</hi> Then (if we may ſo ſpeake) there is joy in hell, <hi>as there is joy indeed in heaven at the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſinner. So there is a kind of joy in hell, when one ſinnes that is converted.</hi> If any thing can make the devils merry, it is this, to give a godly man the foyle; though they ſee he is paſt their reach to deſtroy him, yet if they can but blemiſh or diſgrace him, if they can but trouble and diſquiet him; this is their delight. Hence it is that <hi>Generall Satan</hi> with his legions of darkneſſe, thoſe infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſpirits encampe about ſuch perſons with deadly hatred. As when an Army meets with a ſtrong Caſtle or City, they ſit downe and there conſider what courſe to take for the beſiedging and gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</p>
               <q>Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant <hi>Job.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>The title which God gives <hi>Job</hi> is very obſervable, <hi>My ſervant Job.</hi> A Servant (you know) is one, that is not at his owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but at the call and becke of another; ſo the Centurion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a ſervant; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am a man under authority and I have ſervants, and I ſay to this man goe and he goeth, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother come and he commeth.</hi> Servants are at the word of another, they are not (<hi>ſui juris</hi>) in their own power therfore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Servants,<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>living tools,</hi> or <hi>living inſtruments,</hi> breathing inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe they are at the will of another, to be uſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at the diſcretion of their Maſter. Here God calleth <hi>Job</hi> his ſervant. And he calleth him ſo, Firſt, by way of diſtinction or difference; <hi>my ſervant,</hi> that is, mine not his owne; many are their owne ſervants, they ſerve themſelves, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They ſerve not the Lord Jeſus, but their owne bellies,</hi> they ſerve their owne luſts,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> divers luſts and pleaſures; <hi>Job</hi> is not ſuch an one, he is my ſervant.</p>
               <p>Many are Satans ſervants; as if God ſhould have ſaid to Satan here; Satan thou haſt gone about the world, and thou haſt found a great family of thine owne, thou haſt found many ſervants in all places, but <hi>haſt thou conſidered my ſervant?</hi> There is one I am ſure that oweth thee no ſervice, and by his good will, will doe thee none; haſt thou not found my ſervant?</p>
               <p>Some are the ſervants of men; but <hi>Job</hi> is my ſervant; not a ſervant of men, to ſubject himſelfe to their luſts, either for hope or feare. <hi>He is not</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) <hi>the ſervant of men</hi> (in that ſenſe) to pleaſe men, with ſinning againſt and provoking God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:98733:54"/>Secondly, <hi>My Servant,</hi> by way of ſpeciall right and property; So <hi>Job</hi> and all godly perſons are called Gods ſervants: Firſt, by the right of election they are Gods choſen ſervants, as <hi>Paul</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a choſen veſſell,</hi> that is, a choſen ſervant, to carry the name of God. 2. They are Gods ſervants by the right of purchaſe; my ſervant whom I have bought and purchaſed; ſo in the 1 Cor. 6. <hi>You are bought with a price, be not the ſervants of men,</hi> that is, you are bought with a price to be my ſervants, therefore be not the ſervants of men in oppoſition to me, or to my diſſervice in any thing. So <hi>Job</hi> was Gods ſervant by way of purchaſe; <hi>God buyeth every one of his ſervants with the bloud of his ſonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>My ſervant,</hi> by way of Covenant, <hi>Job</hi> was Gods Covenant ſervant, God and he had (as it were) <hi>ſealed Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Job</hi> entered into Covenant with God, that he would performe the duty of a ſervant, and God entered into Covenant with him that he ſhould enjoy the priviledge of a ſervant. Now that which is Gods by right of Covenant, is his by ſpeciall right.</p>
               <p>Then again, We may further underſtand this, and all ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: When God ſaith, <hi>my ſervant,</hi> he doth as it were glory in his ſervant. God ſpeaks of him, as of his <hi>treaſure, my ſervant,</hi> as a man doth of that which he glorieth in. As the Saints glory in God, when they uſe this expreſſion, <hi>my God</hi> and <hi>my Lord, my Maſter</hi> and <hi>my Chriſt,</hi> this is a kind of glorying and triumphing in God. So this expreſſion carieth ſuch a ſenſe in it, <hi>Haſt thou not conſidered my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Job,</hi> there is one that I have honour by, one that I rejoyce and glory in, one that I can ſpeake of with much more, then content, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with tryumph, <hi>my ſervant</hi> Job: <hi>Ther's a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is mans honour to be Gods ſervant, and God thinkes himſelfe honoured by the ſervice of man.</hi> It was once a curſe, and it is a great curſe ſtill to be the <hi>ſervant of ſervants,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Cham</hi>;<note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> but it is an honour, the <hi>great honour</hi> of the creature to be a ſervant to God. He that is a ſervant of Chriſt, is not only free, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And Chriſt reckoneth that he hath not only worke done him, but honour done him by <hi>his willing people,</hi> and therefore he glories in any ſuch, <hi>my ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>My ſervant <hi>Job.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>There is ſomewhat alſo to be conſidered in that. When God ſpeakes of his people by name, it noteth two things in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A ſpeciall care that God hath over them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſpeciall love that God hath to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.3.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98733:55"/>
                  <hi>He calleth his owne Sheepe by name</hi>; this noteth a ſpeciall care Chriſt hath of his ſheepe, and a ſpeciall love that he beareth to them. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.1. <hi>The Lord hath called me from the wombe, from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name,</hi> it noteth the ſpeciall care, and the ſpeciall love that God had of and bare to Chriſt. See it eminently in that place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.12. where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes thus unto God, <hi>Yet thou haſt ſaid I know thee by name</hi>; now what it is to know by name, is by way of Expoſition added in the end of the verſe, <hi>And thou haſt alſo found grace in my ſight.</hi> So that to be knowne by name, is in a ſpeciall manner to find grace in the ſight of God, when it is ſaid here, <hi>My ſervant Job,</hi> it ſhewes that God did take an extraordinary care of, and did in an extraordinary manner love <hi>Job</hi> above all that were upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>There is a great deale of difference betweene theſe two expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to know <hi>the name of a man,</hi> and to know <hi>a man by name.</hi> It is a truth, that God knoweth all your names, and the names of all the men in the world, but he doth not know all <hi>by name.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture aſſures us, that God hath the names of none written, but the names of his owne, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in the former Chapter, <hi>If thou wilt not forgive the ſinne of this people, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy Booke which thou haſt written.</hi> Thou knoweſt me by name, my name is written in thy booke: So <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. Chriſt bad his Diſciples that they ſhould not <hi>rejoyce ſo much that they had the spirits ſubject unto them, but in this they ſhould rejoyce that their names were written in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note from hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God doth take care of his elect children and ſervants in a ſpeciall manner above all other men in the world.</hi> The names of Princes or Emperours or Potentates, if they belong not to God, are not vouchſafed a place in his booke, but the names of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of his Saints, are recorded for ever, and ſhall be had in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting remembrance.</p>
               <q>Haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> that there is none like him in the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>We reade before at the end of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. verſe, that <hi>Job</hi> in reference to his riches was <hi>the greateſt of all the men of the Eaſt:</hi> Now he goeth beyond that, in reference to his holines, he is <hi>the greateſt upon the earth,</hi> there is none like him in the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:98733:55"/>This we may underſtand firſt as a cauſe or reaſon why <hi>Job</hi> fell under the ſpeciall conſideration or obſervation of Satan, <hi>Haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſo ſome render that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle) <hi>or in a much, or for that, there is not the like to him in the Earth.</hi> As if God ſhould ſay, there is reaſon why he muſt needs be taken into thy conſideration; becauſe there is not ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man as he in the earth. You know that a man is quickly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, when there are none like unto him, in the place or company where he is. If a man walke in the ſtreets, or come into a houſe, who is of an extraordinary tallneſſe, ſome will aske the queſtion, did you not obſerve ſuch a man, for there was never a man in the company, never a man in the ſtreet ſo tall as he? So one that is extraordinary in beauty, or extraordinary in rich apparrell, every one hath an eye upon ſuch. The reaſon why many are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is, becauſe they are not <hi>like to others,</hi> they are beyond others in quality or in habit. So here, <hi>Haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like unto him in the Earth,</hi> thou muſt needs take notice of him.</p>
               <p>Or againe, it may be underſtood thus; as the matter which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſhould conſider and obſerve in <hi>Job. Haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>ſc.</hi> in this thing, that there is not a man upon the earth like to him? Haſt thou not taken notice of this in him? Thou who haſt looked over all men, and haſt (as it were) ſifted all mens manners, haſt thou not obſerved thus much, that there is not ſuch a man upon the earth as <hi>Job?</hi> Hath not that fallen under thy obſervation.</p>
               <p>So now in the words [<hi>There is none like him</hi>] there is a ſecret advancing of the praiſe of <hi>Job.</hi> For there is nothing that can be ſpoken more to the praiſe of a man then this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſt quaſi quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Apoſiope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis maximarum laudum.</hi>
                  </note> to ſay that there is none like him. Though you ſay no more you have ſaid all. As the Scripture (we know) ſets forth the wonderfull praiſes of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Who is like unto thee O Lord, amongſt the gods? Who is like thee?</hi> Which is reſolved into the negative, there is none amongſt the gods like unto thee, there is none like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee. <hi>This is the high praiſe of God.</hi> Mic. 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity?</hi> It is the higheſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God to ſay, there is none like him, to ſet him above all creatures. In like manner here in the Text, when it is affirmed, that there was none like <hi>Job</hi>; this ſetteth him up in all praiſes and excellencies to the higheſt: though particulars be concealed, yet
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98733:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whatſoever may make for the honour of a man is included in this, that there is none like him.</p>
               <p>But how ſhould we underſtand this of <hi>Job,</hi> that there was none like to him upon the earth?</p>
               <p>We muſt underſtand it, not only in reference to wicked men, that there was no meer naturall man, no wicked man like unto him: as if God had ſaid to Satan, there is none in the earth which is thy inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, no earthly man <hi>like my ſervant</hi> Job; look over all thy ſervants thou haſt not ſuch an one in the earth. That's too low. We wil take it therfore in reference to all the Saints that were then upon the earth, there was not ſuch a godly man upon the earth, none like unto him: and then we muſt expound <hi>likenes</hi> by a diſtinction. There is a double <hi>likenes</hi>; there is a <hi>likenes of Quality</hi>; and there is a <hi>likeneſſe of Equality.</hi> When it is ſaid here, that in the Earth there was none like to <hi>Job,</hi> you muſt not underſtand it of a likeneſſe of quality, as if there were no man that had ſuch qualities as <hi>Job</hi> had: for all the Saints that are in the earth, have the ſame kind of qualities, they are all alike in the maine and in the generall: namely in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of their nature to the will of God, which is holineſſe,</hi> that is the generall quality; and thus all the Saints upon the earth are alike; there is not any man can have any other likeneſſe upon him than this, it is impoſſible. I ſay in this regard, the meaneſt and loweſt Saint upon the earth, is like to the higheſt and greateſt Saint upon earth: yea not only ſo, but the meaneſt Saint upon earth, is like to Jeſus Chriſt <hi>in heaven,</hi> in regard of quality; he hath the ſame quality,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> the ſame nature, he is <hi>made partaker of the divine nature:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.5.</note> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Philippians, Let, this mind be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt.</hi> The meaneſt Saint hath the ſame mind and the ſame quality in reference to his new nature that is in God himſelfe or in Chriſt, he is like to God, <hi>God begetteth all his owne children in his owne likeneſſe.</hi> But in regard of the <hi>likeneſſe of equality</hi>; thus <hi>Iob</hi> was ſuch a man as there was <hi>none like him in the earth</hi>; no man like him in the degrees of thoſe qualities, they were not equall to him in this or that or the other grace. <hi>Iob</hi> was a man above them all. As we know it is with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and naturall men, all wicked men upon the earth are as like one to another as can be, <hi>As face anſwereth to face in water, ſo doth the heart of man to man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 27.19.</note> the heart of one naturall man to the other: but yet there are ſome wicked men ſo wicked, that there is <hi>none like them in the earth.</hi> We have the very ſame words applyed to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98733:56"/>
                  <hi>Ahab</hi> in wickedneſſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.25. <hi>But there was none like to</hi> Ahab, <hi>which did ſell himſelfe to worke wickedneſſe in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> None like unto him, not I ſay (as in the former) that there were no wicked men that had the ſame ſinfull qualities, for all have the ſame ſinfull qualities, but there was none like him in equality of wickedneſſe, <hi>Ahab was a None-ſuch,</hi> he was a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in wickedneſſe, none were growne to ſuch a ſtature of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as <hi>Ahab.</hi> In the ſame manner we muſt underſtand this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Job,</hi> none did reach to him in the <hi>equality of his graces,</hi> in the ſtature of the inward man, Job <hi>had out-growne all the world in grace at that time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet a little further for the underſtanding of this: We find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when the Scripture ſaith of a man, that there is none like to him, the ſpeech is to be reſtrained to ſome one particular. And it may be a <hi>Question</hi> whether we are to underſtand this of <hi>Jobs</hi> preheminence in the ganerall or in regard of ſome one particular grace? We reade of <hi>Solomon</hi> that there was none like him, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.26. <hi>Among many Nations was there no King like him who was beloved of his God.</hi> There was no King like to <hi>Solomon,</hi> but he reſtraineth it to this, <hi>who was beloved of his God,</hi> none to whom God did ſo much communicate himſelfe as to <hi>Solomon,</hi> none like to <hi>Solomon</hi> in wiſedome and knowledge, in thoſe revelations and intimate communions that God had with him, he was as it were <hi>Gods darling,</hi> as his other Name <hi>Jedediah</hi> importeth. Then it is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (ſee another inſtance,) 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.5. <hi>That he truſted in the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſo that after him was none like him among all the Kings of</hi> Judah. Now this we muſt underſtand of ſome one particular eſpecially, that is, <hi>of his truſting in the Lord,</hi> in regard of his truſting ſo firmely in God, he went beyond all the Kings that came after him, there was none did ſo perfectly truſt in God: for it is ſaid, he <hi>brake in peeces the braſen ſerpent that</hi> Moſes <hi>had made, and ſtamped it to pouder, trusting in the Lord.</hi> Though ſome of his Counſellours might tell him,<note place="margin">2 King. 18.4.</note> 
                  <hi>If you doe thoſe things you may bring a world of trouble upon your ſelfe and the Kingdome, if you change theſe ancient cuſtomes you will make your people mutinie, this ſerpent was of God, it was made in the wilderneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. Yet ſaith he, I ſee it is abuſed to Idolatry, I care not for all that you ſay, <hi>I will truſt in the Lord how ever it goe.</hi> Here was an high, an unparalel'd act of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Yet afterward it was ſaid concerning <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 King. 23.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98733:57"/>
25. <hi>That like unto him was there no King before him, that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his ſoule, and with all his might.</hi> Here it is ſaid after <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that <hi>Joſiah</hi> was ſuch a King as there was none before him; and it was ſaid of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> that was before him, that he was ſuch a one, that after him there ſhould be none like him. How ſhall we reconcile theſe two? Onely by applying thoſe expreſſions to ſuch and ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ſuch a man, as there was no King after him for <hi>truſting in God,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> was ſuch a man, as there was no King before him <hi>for deſire, care and zeale in reforming the Church of God: Joſiah's</hi> reformation was the moſt perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that was made by all the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſo in that particular, in regard of his great zeale for God there was no King before him, like him. How ſhall we underſtand this then concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Job?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer in two Concluſions. Firſt, When it is ſaid, <hi>there was none like to</hi> Job, we are to underſtand it in reference to that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Doubtleſſe God had as great ones in grace as <hi>Job,</hi> both before and afterward, <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> before him, were eminent ones; and afterward, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Samuel.</hi> But take <hi>Job</hi> in the time and the age wherein he lived, ſo there was none like unto him in equality, we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it ſo; For <hi>Job</hi> is conceived to be in the darker times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> about the time that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in captivity in <hi>Egypt</hi>; ſo that in reference to that time <hi>Job</hi> lived in, he was the only man, the chiefe man, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for grace in that age: As it is ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> he was <hi>a juſt man, and perfect in his generations,</hi> he was the juſteſt man of all that age, the moſt righteous of all that generation: ſo was <hi>Job</hi> in his.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We may underſtand it, not only concerning ſome particular grace wherein he was moſt eminent: although it be a truth, that he had one grace, for which he was <hi>cryed up</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more then for others, to wit, <hi>Patience, Have you not heard of the patience of</hi> Job? But we may take it for the whole latitude of <hi>Jobs</hi> holineſſe and graces, and there was not at that time ſuch a man upon the earth as <hi>Job:</hi> And ſo God himſelfe ſeemeth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, he doth not confine this to ſome one point, but ſaith, <hi>Hast thou not conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in the earth? a perfect and upright man, one that feareth
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98733:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God and eſcheweth evill?</hi> God addeth this by way of expoſition, what he meaneth by a man to whom there was none like, who had no match upon the earth. In thoſe words the whole ſumme of godlineſſe is compriſed; whatſoever goes, or may be conceived to goe toward the making up of a godly man, falls under one of thoſe foure members. And God ſaith there is none like him, take him in any or in all theſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only give you two or three briefe obſervations from hence. <hi>There is none like unto him in the earth.</hi> Learn,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That God hath ſervants of all statures and degrees.</hi> All his ſervants come not to the like pitch, to the like hight, here is one that is beyond them all, <hi>My ſervant</hi> Job, not a man like him upon the earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Note this, <hi>We ought not to ſet up our reſt in low degrees of grace; or content our ſelves to be like others in grace,</hi> we ſhould labour (if it be poſſible) to goe beyond all others in grace. It did not ſatisfie <hi>Job</hi> that he had gotten to ſuch a degree, to ſuch a frame and temper of heart, to ſuch a courſe of holineſſe as his neighbours or bretheren that were good, had attained unto, but he laboured to goe beyond them all; <hi>Not ſuch a man upon the earth as</hi> Job. It is an <hi>holy ambition</hi> to labour to exceed all other in grace and goodneſſe. We have a great many in the world that deſire to be ſo rich, as none ſhould be like them; to be ſo gay in their apparell, as none ſhould be like them, ſo beautifull, as none ſhould be like them; but where are they that deſire and endeavour to have ſuch a portion or ſtock of grace, that none ſhould be like them, to be above others in holineſſe, as <hi>Job</hi> was? True grace never reſts in any degrees or meaſures of grace, but labours to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: he that hath any grace would have more; doe not thinke it enough when you are like others, you ought to labour to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond others.</p>
               <p>Then ſee the <hi>Character</hi> that God giveth of <hi>Job, A perfect and upright man, one that feareth God and eſcheweth evill.</hi>

               <p>Theſe have beene already opened in the firſt verſe, and theſe are but a report of the Hiſtory before going, therefore I ſhall not need to ſtay upon his place; onely take theſe two Obſervations from it.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, <hi>God hath a perfect Character of every ſoule.</hi> He knoweth fully and clearely what the temper of your hearts and ſpirits are, juſt as the hiſtory and relation of <hi>Job</hi> was, ſuch is Gods teſtimony of him to a tittle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:98733:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>Secondly this, <hi>God will give to every man a testimony accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his utmoſt worth</hi>; God will not conceale any of your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or obſcure your goodneſſe, he will make it knowne to the world to the full, what you are. When God commeth to give teſtimony, he giveth it ſo, as his Saints can never looſe by it. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes man gives a teſtimony ſhort of his Brothers goodnes, and draweth a curtaine before another mans worth; but God will draw the curtaine quite backe, and unvaile every ſoule to the whole world. You ſhall ſee and heare a teſtimony from God before men and Angels concerning your ſelves to the uttermoſt, what you are in all godly and gracious perfections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> was an excellent man, a man commended indeed, who was commended of God: as the Apoſtle concludes it, <hi>not he that commendeth himſelfe is approved, but he whom God commendeth.</hi> It is good for us to have our <hi>Letters Teſtimoniall from God,</hi> to have our Letters Commendatory from Heaven. It is not what a man ſaith in his own heart, what he flattereth himſelfe; It is not what your neighbours or others flatter you and ſay of you, but what God ſaith of you, what teſtimony he giveth of you. He is not approved that commendeth himſelfe, or that other men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend only, but he whom the Lord commendeth. <hi>And if God speake well of us, no matter though all the world be ſilent or ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>

                     <p>Then Satan anſwered the Lord and ſaid, doth <hi>Job</hi> feare God for naught?</p>
                     <p>Haſt not thou made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath on every ſide? Thou haſt bleſſed the worke of his hands, and his ſubſtance is increaſed in the Land.</p>

               <p>IN the former verſe <hi>Job</hi> receiveth teſtimony from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in this, though Satan cannot deny it, yet he calumniates, and miſinterprets what he cannot contradict. Satan grants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98733:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that <hi>Job</hi> feares God, but the latter words embaſe the former, and faſten inſincerity upon all his ſervices. <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>feare God for nought?</hi> Feare is worth nothing unleſſe in this ſenſe it be for nought. I have already ſhewed you what it is to feare God, I ſhall now cleare the other terme, and ſhew how much evill Satan charges <hi>Job</hi> with, when he queſtions, <hi>doth</hi> Job <hi>feare God for nought?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Satan accuſeth with a queſtion, <hi>doth</hi> Job <hi>feare God for nought?</hi> The queſtion may be reſolved into this Accuſation. <hi>Job</hi> doth not feare God for nought. The word which we tranſlate <hi>for nought,</hi> hath a threefold ſenſe from the Hebrew.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some render it <hi>in vain. Doth</hi> Job <hi>feare God</hi> (fruſtra,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note>) <hi>in vaine.</hi> We are then ſaid to doe a thing in vaine, when we cannot attaine the end which we propoſe in doing of it. <hi>The</hi> Egyptians <hi>helpe in vaine,</hi> that is, they cannot procure that ſalvation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance which was deſired or intended: and ſo the ſenſe here may be, <hi>doth</hi> Job <hi>feare God in vaine</hi>? No he doth not, he hath his end, he looked for riches, that he intended in taking up the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and that he hath attained.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is interpreted by, without cauſe, <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>feare God without cauſe?</hi> ſo the word is tranſlated, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.7. where <hi>David</hi> complaining of his enemies, ſaith, <hi>without cauſe have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cauſe they have dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for my ſoule.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I never gave them any cauſe why they ſhould lay ſnares for me, I never wronged or hurt any of them. According to this ſenſe, when Satan ſaith <hi>doth</hi> Job <hi>feare God for nought?</hi> namely, without cauſe, it is as if he had ſaid, The Lord hath given <hi>Job</hi> reaſon enough, he hath given him cauſe enough to doe what he doth; <hi>Job</hi> ſeeth reaſon in his Flocks and in his Heards, in his many Children, and in his great Houſhold, in his Subſtance, and in his Honour, he ſeeth reaſon in all theſe, why he ſhould feare God, and be a very obedient ſervant, having ſo boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull a Maſter. <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>feare God without cauſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or thirdly, The word is tranſlated by <hi>Gratis</hi> (as we expreſſe it) to doe a thing <hi>gratis,</hi> that is to doe a thing without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, without any price, or without pay. I ſhall inſtance Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wherein the word is rendred in that ſenſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.15. <hi>Laban</hi> ſaith to <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was come to him, to ſerve him, <hi>Thou art my kinſman, ſhouldeſt thou therefore ſerve me for nought?</hi> that is, ſhouldeſt thou ſerve me <hi>gratis,</hi> or without wages, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98733:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his meaning in the next words, <hi>tell me what ſhall thy wages be?</hi> So that to doe a thing for nought, is to doe a thing without wages, without price. And ſo there is the ſame interpretation of the word, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.11. where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of the Maid that was taken into the family and was not married, ſaith, <hi>If he doe not theſe three unto her, then ſhe ſhall goe out free without money,</hi> ſhe ſhall pay nothing, ſhe ſhall goe out <hi>gratis,</hi> or for nought. So here we may take in this ſenſe to fill up the forme, doth <hi>Job</hi> ſerve God <hi>gratis?</hi> doth he ſerve God without price or without pay? Surely no, thou haſt given him ſufficient hyre, wages ſufficient for all his ſervice, <hi>Job</hi> doth not ſerve thee <hi>gratis,</hi> out of good will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to thee, but he ſerveth thee for hire, becauſe thou payeſt him ſo plentifully.</p>
               <p>So the generall ſenſe of the words, <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>feare God for nought?</hi> is as if Satan had beſpoken the Lord in ſuch words as theſe. Lord thou doeſt enquire of me whether <hi>I had conſidered thy ſervant</hi> Job? <hi>I confeſſe I have, and I muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he is a man very diligent and zealous in thy worſhip and ſervice; neither doe I wonder that he is ſo, ſeeing thou haſt out-bid all his labours and indeavours by heapes of benefits. There is no question but thou mayest have ſervants enough upon ſuch termes, at ſuch rates as theſe: no marvaile if</hi> Job <hi>be willing to doe whatſoever thou commandeſt, whenas thou beſtowest upon</hi> Job <hi>whatſoever he deſireth. Thou ſeemeſt as it were to neglect all other men, and only to intend the ſafety and proſperity of thy darling</hi> Job. <hi>Is it any great matter, that he who hath received a flocke of ſeven thouſand Sheepe from thee, ſhould offer a few,</hi> 7. <hi>or</hi> 10. <hi>to thee in ſacrifice? Is it any great matter that he ſhould give ſome of his fleeces to cloath the poore, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from thee ſo many thouſands to cloath and enrich himſelfe? Is it a strange thing that he ſhould feede a few that hath</hi> 500 <hi>yoake of Oxen? Is not</hi> Job <hi>well hired to worke for thee? doth he feare God for nought who hath recived all theſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet a little more diſtinctly for the opening of this expreſſion, I ſhall give you Satans ſenſe in three notable falſities or lyes, which he twiſts up together in this one ſpeech, <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>feare God for nought?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, That riches will make any man ſerve God, that it is no great matter to be holy when we have abundance; a man that proſpers in the world cannot chooſe but be good. This Satan im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98733:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in theſe words, and this is an extreame lye; for as there is no affliction, ſo there is no outward bleſſing can change the heart or bring it about unto God, <hi>They did not ſerve the Lord in the abundance of all things,</hi> Deut. 28.47. Abundance doth not draw the heart unto God. Yet Satan would inferre that it doth. This might well be retorted upon Satan himſelfe; Satan why diddeſtnot thou ſerve God then? thou diddeſt once receive more outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings from God then ever <hi>Iob</hi> did, the bleſſedneſſe of an Angell; yet that glorious Angelicall eſtate wherein thou waſt created, could not keepe thee in the compaſſe of obedience, thou diddeſt rebell in the abundance of all bleſſings, and diddeſt leave thy habitation, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan thou ſhouldeſt not have ſerved God for nought. Why then didſt not thou ſerve him? thine owne Apoſtacy refutes thy errour in making ſo little of <hi>Jobs</hi> obedience, becauſe he had received ſo much.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is this in it; <hi>Doeth</hi> Job <hi>feare God for nought?</hi> Satan intimates, that God could have no ſervants for love, none unleſſe he did pay them extreamely; That, God is ſuch a Maſter, and his worke ſuch as none would meddle with, vnleſſe allured by benefits; As if Satan ſhould ſay, you have indeed one eminent ſervant, but you ſhould not have had him unleſſe you had beene at double coſt with him. Here is another lye Satan windeth up cloſely in this ſpeech; For the truth is, Gods ſervants follow him for himſelfe, the very excellencies of God, and ſweetneſſe of his wayes, are the argument and the wages by which his people are chiefely moved and hired to his ſervice. God indeed makes many promiſes to thoſe that ſerve him, but he never makes any bargaines with them: His obey him freely. Satan makes bargaines to hire men to his ſervice, as he did with Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.9. <hi>All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worſhip mee.</hi> God makes many large and gracious promiſes, but he never makes any ſuch bargaine and agreement with men for their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>Then there is a third ſenſe full of falſehood, which Satan ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth upon <hi>Iob, Doeth</hi> Job <hi>feare God for nought?</hi> that is, <hi>Iob</hi> hath a byas in all that he doth, he is carryed by the gaine of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, not by any delight in godlineſſe thus to ſerve God. <hi>Job</hi> is mercinary, he ſerveth God for hire; <hi>Job</hi> hath not any deſire to pleaſe God, but to benefit himſelfe; <hi>Job</hi> doth not ſeeke the glory of God, but he ſeekes his owne advantage. This is the ſenſe which the words have in reference to the perſon of <hi>Job</hi>; that as once Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98733:60"/>
accus'd God unto man, ſo, now he accuſeth this man unto God; He accus'd God unto man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. When God had forbidden him to eate of the Tree of knowledge of good and evill, and told him that in the day he did eate thereof he ſhould ſurely die; <hi>You ſhall not ſurely die,</hi> ſaith Satan, <hi>for God knoweth that in the day you eate thereof, then your eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evill.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, God hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden this tree, becauſe it will doe you any hurt, but becauſe he would be God alone, he would have all the knowledge to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he hath an ill intent: he knowes that if you eate of it, you will be like him, as gods knowing good and evill. So heere hee accuſeth man to God, <hi>Job</hi> ſerveth you indeed and offereth you ſacrifice and obeyeth you, but it is that he may get by you, that he may receive more and more from you, he likes the pay, the reward, not the worke; he cares not for God, but for the good that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from him. This is the accuſation which here the ſlanderer caſteth upon all the holy ſervices and duties of <hi>Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus in briefe you ſee the ſenſe, I ſhall give you ſome obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from it.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, <hi>It is an argument of a most malignant ſpirit, when a mans actions are faire, then to accuſe his intentions.</hi> The Devill hath nothing to ſay againſt the actions of <hi>Job,</hi> but he goes downe into his heart and accuſeth his intentions. Malice miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets the faireſt actions, but love puts the faireſt interpretation it can upon foule actions. Malice will ſay when a man doth well, it is true he doth it, but it is for vaine glory, it is to be ſeene of men, it is for his own ends, it is for gaine; But when a man doth ill, love will ſay, this he hath done through ignorance, or inadvertency or violent temptations, love covers a multitude of ſinnes as fairely as poſſibly it may with wiſedome and with juſtice; How faire a cover did Chriſt himſelfe put upon the fouleſt act that ever was in the world, upon his own crucifying, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they doe</hi>;<note place="margin">Luk. 23.24.</note> they doe it indeed, but they doe it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly: So <hi>Peter</hi> afterward, <hi>I wot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance you did it, as did alſo your Rulers.</hi> Love excuſeth what is ill done in another, and malice accuſeth what others doe well. Let ſuch men learne from hence, that in ſo do. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>y are the mouth and tongue of Satan.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We may obſerve from hence; <hi>That it is an argument of a baſe and an unworthy ſpirit to ſerve God for ends.</hi> Had this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98733:60"/>
been true of <hi>Job</hi> in Satans ſenſe, it had indeed ſpoyled and blemiſhed all that he had done. Thoſe that come unto God upon ſuch termes they are not holy, but crafty; they make a trade with God, they doe not ſerve God, it is not <hi>Obedientia,</hi> but <hi>Mercatura,</hi> as one expreſſeth it, it is merchandizing with God, not obeying him. There is reward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in God himſelfe, there is reward enough in the very duties themſelvs, work and wages go together. Therfore for any to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out to the ſervice of God upon outward things, argues a baſe &amp; an eartthly ſpirit. As ſin is puniſhment enough unto it ſelfe, though there were no other puniſhment, though there were no hell to come after, yet to do evill is or will be hell enough unto it ſelfe:<note place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nec ſacile In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venies multis in millibus unu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> virtutem pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium qui putet eſſe ſui.</hi>

                  </note> So to do good is reward enough unto it ſelfe. A Heathen Poet obſerved it as a brand of Infamy upon the age wherein he lived, that moſt did repent that they had done good or were good <hi>gratis</hi> or for nought, that the price of all good actions fell in their eſteeme, unleſſe they could raiſe themſelves. If a Heathen condemn'd this, how dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable is it among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But here a Queſtion will ariſe, and I ſhall a little debate it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth further cleare the maine point, <hi>May we not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our owne good or unto the benefit we ſhall receive from God?</hi> Is it unlawfull to have an eye to our owne advantage, while we doe our duty? Muſt we ſerve God for nought in that ſtrict ſenſe, or els will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od account nothing of all our ſervices?</p>
               <p>I ſhall cleare that in five briefe Concluſions, and theſe will (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) fully ſtate the ſenſe of this Text and of this ſpeech.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, There is no man doth or poſſibly can ſerve God for nought. God hath by benefits already beſtowed, and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits promiſed out-vyed and out-bid all the endeavours and ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the creature. If a man had a thouſand paire of hands, a thouſand tongues and a thouſand heads, and ſhould ſet them all on worke for God, he were never able to anſwer the ingagements and obligations which God hath already put upon him. Therfore this is a truth, that no man can in a ſtrict ſenſe ſerve God for nought. God is not beholden to any creature for any worke or ſervice that is done unto him.</p>
               <p>Againe ſecondly, this is further to be conſidered. The more outward bleſſings any one doth receive, the more he ought to ſerve God, and the more ſervice God lookes for at his hands. That is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Concluſion. Therefore we find ſtill, that when God hath beſtowed many outward bleſſings upon any, either perſons or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98733:61"/>
he chargeth an acknowledgement upon them, Hoſ. 2.8. <hi>She did not know that I gave her corne and wine and oyle, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed her ſilver and gold which ſhe bestowed upon</hi> Baal, <hi>therefore I will come and recover it,</hi> ſaith <hi>God.</hi> You having received this, you ought to have ſerved me with it. You ſee how God upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.7, 8. <hi>I annoynted thee King of Iſrael, and I delivered thee out of the hand of</hi> Saul, <hi>and I gave thee thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters houſe and thy Maſters wives into thy boſome, and if this had beene too little, I would moreover have given thee ſuch and ſuch things. How is it then that thou haſt despiſed the Commandement of the Lord, to doe evill in his ſight?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, the more I beſtowed upon thee, the more obligations thou ſhouldeſt feele thy ſelfe under to obey me faithfully.</p>
               <p>In the third place, it is lawfull to have ſome reſpect to benefits both received and promiſed by way of Motive and incouragement to ſtir us up and quicken us, either in doing or in ſuffering for God. <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. 11.26. <hi>had respect to the recompence of reward,</hi> therefore it is not unlawfull; and <hi>Christ</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at the joy that was ſet before him.</hi> Theſe are examples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exceptions, that reſpect may be had to benefits and bleſſings received or exſpected.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Then reference unto benefit is ſinfull, when wee make it either the ſole and only cauſe, or the ſupreame and chiefe cauſe of our obedience. This makes any thing we doe ſmell ſo of our ſelves that God abides it not, when we reſpect our ſelves, either alone or above God, God hath no reſpect at all to us. As Chriſt taxes thoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>You did not ſeeke me but the loaves,</hi> to have reſpect to the loaves more then to Chriſt, or as much as to Chriſt, is to have no reſpect at all to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus when the <hi>Sichemites, Gen.</hi> 34.23. admitted of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſo gave up themſelves as a Covenant-people to God, here was all the argument they propoſed to themſelves, <hi>Shall not their cattell and their ſubſtance and every beast of theirs be ours?</hi> What beaſts were theſe <hi>Sichemites,</hi> what ſhadowes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who would take upon them this badge of Religion for the gaine of beaſts and worldly ſubſtance? Such pure reſpects to our ſelves, defile all our ſervices and render our perſons odious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
               <p>Therefore in all our duties and holy ſervices, we muſt ſet the glory of God in the Throne, that muſt be above; and then we may
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98733:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſet our deſires of Heaven and glory on the right hand, we may ſet the feare of hell and the avoyding of miſery on the left hand, we may ſet our deſires of enjoying outward comforts here in the world at the foot-ſtoole. Thus we muſt marſhall and ranke reſpects to God and our ſelves. And thus we may look upon outward things, as motives and incouragements; we muſt not make them ends and cauſes; we may make them as occaſions, but not as grounds of our obedience.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We may looke upon them as fruits and conſequents of holineſſe, yea as incouragements unto holineſſe, but not as cauſes of our holineſſe, or we may eye theſe as <hi>media,</hi> through which to ſee the bounty and goodneſſe of God, not as <hi>objecta</hi> on which to fixe and terminate our deſires. So much for the clearing of the firſt part of Satans anſwer, <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>ſerve God for nought?</hi> Wherein you ſee he caſts dirt upon <hi>Jobs</hi> ſincereſt duties, and how we may carry our reſpects in the ſervice of God to outward bleſſings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received or promiſed. It followeth.</p>
               <q>

                  <p>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him and about his houſe, and about all that he hath on every ſide? Thou haſt bleſſed the worke of his hands and his ſubſtance is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in the land.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Here Satan more fully expounds himſelf, and what he meaneth by <hi>Jobs</hi> not ſerving God for nought. You ſhall ſee it is not for nought. He caſts up the particulars of Gods benefits conferred on <hi>Job,</hi> and they amount to a great ſumme. 1. Hee hath an <hi>hedge</hi> about him, that is ſomewhat. 2. He hath <hi>bleſſed</hi> him that's more: 3. He doth <hi>increaſe</hi> and <hi>multiply,</hi> there's the higheſt degree of outward happineſſe. Here are three degrees of Gods dealing with <hi>Job.</hi> Theſe Satan reckons up in this verſe, that he may make <hi>Jobs</hi> goodneſſe of no account, and leave his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in no degree of acceptance with God.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Here is a <hi>Benediction</hi> upon that which was protected. It was not a bare keeping of that from ſpoyling, <hi>but it was a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, here is alſo an <hi>increaſe</hi> or multiplication, he was not only bleſſed to keepe himſelfe and all he had in the ſtate and plight wherein he ſtood, but there was a daily increaſe and an augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

So when God is ſaid to make an hedge or a wall about a man or about a Nation, the ſafety of that man or Nation is aſſured by it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.2. We have this word uſed, where God ſpeakes of his vineyard, <hi>He planted a vineyard in a very fruitfull hill, and he fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, or he made a wall or a hedge about it.</hi> So <hi>verſe</hi> 5. when God is angry with his vineyard and will deſtroy i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, it is thus expreſt, <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>take away the hedge thereof,</hi> that is, I will take away my protection from it. In the ſame ſenſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.5. <hi>I will be</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>a wall of fire round about</hi>; that is, I will be a defence unto it. So when it is ſaid here, that <hi>God</hi> had made a <hi>hedge about</hi> Job, it notes divine Protection, he was under the wing and ſafeguard of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>This hedge of protection is two-fold.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Sometime the hedge of protection is made by the hands of others. God ſends out his Angels to guard his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7. <hi>The Angell of the Lord encampeth round about them that feare him.</hi> Encamping and hedging are to the ſame purpoſe, Gods hedge is as ſtrong for ſafety as any wall, as any trench. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time God doth make one man to be a hedge or a defence to another. The ſervants of <hi>Naball</hi> ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.16. <hi>That he had been a wall unto them both by night and day</hi>; that is, he had been a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98733:62"/>
protection and a guard to them, he had defended them all the while his Army was quarter'd in thoſe parts. God makes a good man to be as a wall to a wicked man. How much more will he make men and Angels to be wals and hedges for the ſecurity of his owne people?</p>
               <p>The Text further goes on and ſhewes the compaſſe of this hedge, what ground it takes in, how farre it reacheth: and here we ſhall find that it was a very large hedge of a great extent. We know there are ſome Cities that have not only a ſingle wall, but a double wall, yea ſome ſtrong Cities and places have a treble wall about them: So wee finde a three-fold hedge made about <hi>Job,</hi> and they are all expreſt here in this Text.</p>
               <p>Here was a hedge, firſt about his <hi>Perſon,</hi> that was the inmoſt hedge, or the inmoſt wall, in theſe words, <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him?</hi> That is, an hedge about the very perſon of <hi>Job,</hi> an hedge about his body leaſt any ſickneſſe, diſeaſes or dangers ſhould invade it, and an hedge about his ſoule, leaſt ſnares and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould take hold of, or prevaile againſt that; thou haſt made an hedge about him, ſo that I cannot come at the perſon of <hi>Job</hi> to hurt him.</p>
               <p>Againe, Beſides this inmoſt wall, and the neareſt about his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, there is a ſecond wall or hedge, and that is expreſt to be about his Family, <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him and about his houſe?</hi> By houſe we are not to underſtand the materiall houſe of ſtone or timber, the edifice in which <hi>Job</hi> dwelt, but by the houſe we are to underſtand the houſhold, <hi>Job</hi> and his family, as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Scripture, the houſe is put for the family. <hi>This day</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Zacheus) is ſalvation come to thy houſe</hi>;<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> and it is ſaid of the Jaylor, <hi>that he beleeved and all his houſe,</hi> that is all his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; ſo here, thou haſt made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, that is, about his Family, about his children eſpecially: hence the Hebrew word for a child, for a ſonne, doth ſignifie an houſe, becauſe children build up the houſe or keep up the name of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. So that the houſe hedg'd about, is the children, the family and the followers and ſervants of <hi>Job</hi>; as if Satan ſhould ſay, thou haſt made an hedge not only about his perſon, but about all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him about his children and ſervants, I may not meddle with them neither. There is the ſecond hedge.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There is a third hedge or wall, <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath?</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:98733:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That is about his goods, about his cattell and about his lands: ſo farre as ever any thing of <hi>Jobs</hi> doth extend,<note place="margin">Jobus <hi>nihil ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vile &amp; exile habet quod non cuſtodiendum in tuam ſuſceperis tutelam.</hi> Lavat. <hi>in loc.</hi>
                  </note> ſo farre the hedge go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; if <hi>Job</hi> have but the leaſt thing abroad, God doth make an hedge about it, he hath not the meaneſt thing belonging unto him, but is under guard and protection. That is the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>There is yet another thing to be obſerved in the words to make it more full. <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath on every ſide?</hi> It is not only ſaid, thou haſt made an hedge about him, but thou haſt made an hedge about him <hi>on every ſide,</hi> which is a <hi>pleonaſme</hi> or redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſpeech.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Illud quod per circuitum val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latur, ex nullâ parte poteſt pati inſultum.</hi>
                  </note> It was a ſigne of Gods care of <hi>Job,</hi> when he made an hedge about him, but to ſay he made an <hi>hedge about him on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide,</hi> here is expreſt an extraordinary care, that God had not left the leaſt gappe for Satan or for any annoyance to come in unto <hi>Job.</hi> There is not the leaſt breach, the leaſt hole, thou haſt hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him round about on every ſide,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Per circuitum circumcirca.</hi>
                  </note> whereby the wonderfull ſafety of <hi>Job,</hi> his family and eſtate is ſet out under the protection of God. That for the opening of thoſe words.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We may obſerve from the manner of this ſpeech, <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him?</hi> Satan ſpeakes very angerly. Queſtions as they ever expreſſe quickneſſe of ſpirit, ſo they many times expreſſe much paſſion and trouble of ſpirit. Here. Satan in queſtioning, ſpeakes as if he were vext, <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him?</hi> Hence note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the protection which God gives to his people and ſervants is the vexation of Satan and of all his Inſtruments.</hi> It troubleth them extreamely that God doth ſo guard and hedge up his people, that they cannot come at them. No man can endure to ſee that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, which he wiſheth were deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Then againe, if we conſider the matter of Satans ſpeech, it is a truth and a moſt comfortable truth, a truth full of conſolation to the people of God, <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his houſe, and about all that he hath on every ſide?</hi> We may note hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Satan the father of lyes ſometimes speakes truth for his owne advantage.</hi> For as it is ſaid concerning <hi>Judas</hi> about his care for the poore, when he would have had the oyntment ſold and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the poore, <hi>This he ſaid</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>not that he cared for the poore, but becauſe he was a theefe, and had the bagge and bare what was put therein.</hi> So we may ſay here, Satan ſets forth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98733:63"/>
the care of God over his people in moſt exact termes; And why doth he doe this? Not that he cares to ſpeake well of God, or to advance God in the eyes of his people, by telling his people and ſervants how watchfull he is over them: but he doth this only for his owne advantage, that hereby he may leſſen the ſervice and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh the obedience of <hi>Job,</hi> becauſe he received ſo much care and love from God. As it is many times with ungodly men, they will doe good, not that they care to doe good, but only for ſome bie-end: So Satan will ſometimes ſpeake that which is true, not that he regards the truth, or that he would ſpeake a word of truth (for he hath nothing but lyes in his heart, there is a lye in his heart when there is truth in his mouth.) He never ſpeakes truth but to deceive and doe hurt by it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Wee may obſerve this, which lyeth plaine in the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the people and ſervants of God dwell in the middeſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, in the middeſt of dangers</hi>; Why elſe need there be an hedge, a wall about them? What need there be a guard about them, unleſſe there were dangers about them? There are none in the world ſo envyed and ſpighted, ſo aimed at and perſecuted as the people and ſervants of God; you may ſee it by the wall that is made about them; God will not beſtow coſt and care in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and guarding where there is no danger of invading. If you ſhould come to a City and ſee it mightily fortified, and ſee men make wall after wall about it, and bulwarke after bulwarke, you will preſently conjecture, that City ſtands in great danger and is in the middeſt of enemies: So when we reade that God was faine to make wall after wall, to make hedge after hedge about the perſon, the family, the eſtate of <hi>Job,</hi> it ſheweth that the devill had an ill eye upon <hi>Job</hi> and upon all that was <hi>Jobs</hi>; Satan and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had it not bin for this hedge, would quickly have fallen upon him. No godly man ſhould live a quiet moment, did not the Lord ſtretch forth his hand to ſave and protect him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God himſelfe doth undertake the guarding and protecting of his people. Thou haſt made an hedge about him and about all that he hath.</hi> God himſelfe either doth it immediately, or he doth put thoſe to doe it to whom he giveth his power, ſtrength and wiſdom. There is no meere creature could be ſtrength and ſecurity enough for us againſt our great malicious and mighty enemies,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98733:64"/>
therefore God himſelfe either is or makes the hedge. There is no ſtrength in man but Satan can over-match it, Satan can over power all the ſtrength, and out-wit all the wiſdome that is in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Fleſh and blood are no match for a ſpirit. <hi>And we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and spirituall wickedneſſe in high places,</hi> Epheſ. 6.12. But if God makes an hedge about us, it is not in the power of all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the world, whether men or devils to make a gappe in it; they are ſure that are under the protection of God. <hi>They that dwell in the ſecret place of the most high, they ſhall abide (ſafe) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of the Almighty,</hi> Pſ. 91.1.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, You ſee here how farre the hedge goeth, an hedge not onely about his perſon and houſhold, but about all that he hath. Take the meaneſt thing that <hi>Job</hi> hath, God protects it and hedgeth it about. Then we may note this, <hi>That God hath an especiall care, and doth exceedingly price even the meaneſt thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to one of his ſervant.</hi> God would not beſtow an hedge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, if he did not prize it: A man will not hedge or wall that about, which he doth not value. God highly values the meaneſt thing that belongs to one of his ſervants.<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.</note> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</hi> But not only is the bloud, the life of the Saints, precious in the ſight of God, but every member, every haire of their head is precious. God numbers theſe. Not only are their children precious, but every thing that's called theirs, their ſervants, their houſhold, their cattell, their Oxen, their Aſſes, whatſoever they have is all precious in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Satan hath a deadly spight not onely againſt the perſons of the godly, but againſt every thing that belongs unto a godly man.</hi> Satan would not only hurt and annoy them in their perſons, but in every thing that's theirs. If God (if we may ſo ſpeake with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence) ſhould leave but a dogge that belongs unto one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unguarded, Satan would doe it a miſchiefe; Satan would be doing at the leaſt thing, rather then not doe miſchiefe. If he cannot deſtroy our ſoules he would be at the very haire of our heads; therefore Chriſt to comfort the Diſciples in the time of trouble aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.30.</note> 
                  <hi>that the very haires of their heads were numbred:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, God will have an account of every haire, the enemies cannot pull off a haire, but God will call them to a reckoning for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:98733:64"/>And it notes too that the enemies will take hold of any thing that belongs to the people of God, if they cannot get all, they will get a haire if they can, why elſe is it expreſt that the very haires of their heads are numbred? Thoſe words at once intimate, <hi>Gods care of all, and Satans malice against all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It followeth, <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou haſt bleſſed the worke of his hands, and his ſubstance is increaſed in the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou haſt bleſſed.</hi>] The root <hi>Barac</hi> which from the word here uſed, doth ſignifie to bow the knee as well as to bleſſe, becauſe men uſed to how the knee in bleſſing God or man. Bleſſings are carryed three wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From man to man; one man bleſſeth another. There were Propheticall or extraordinary bleſſings, as <hi>Iſaack</hi> bleſſed <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed his ſonnes upon his death-bed; and there is a popular or ordinary bleſſing, to wiſh well to another is to bleſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, every time we pray for our friends, we bleſſe our friends. So man from man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Man bleſſeth God; and then man bleſſeth God when he praiſeth God, when he takes notice of and returnes thankes for the bleſſings received from God. <hi>Bleſſe the Lord O my ſoule,</hi> &amp;c. (Pſal. 103.2.) <hi>and forget not all,</hi> (that is,) <hi>forget not any of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</hi> Thankfully to remember benefits, is to bleſſe the Lord. The Cup in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is called the <hi>Cup of Bleſſing,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16. becauſe therein we commemorate the death of Chriſt, and render thanks to the Name of the Lord, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable benefits conveighed to us by his blood.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as here in the Text, God bleſſeth man. Now God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth man, when he cauſeth that to proſper which man undertakes. Mans bleſſing unto man, it is only a wiſh, an optative bleſſing, but Gods bleſſing unto man is an operative bleſſing as <hi>Aquinas</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Dei benedicere eſt benefacere,</hi> when God wiſheth us good he doth us good.</p>
               <p>So then the ſenſe is, Thou haſt bleſſed: that is, thou haſt cauſed him to proſper and thrive in what he undertakes, as we ſhall ſee in the object of the bleſſing, <hi>Thou haſt bleſſed the worke of his hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The worke of his hands.</hi>] We are not to underſtand it ſtrictly for manuall or hand labours, as if <hi>Job</hi> were a man imployed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manual ſervices, in the labour of his hands, but according
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98733:65"/>
to an ordinary uſe of ſpeech amongſt the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and likewiſe amongſt other Nations, by the <hi>worke of the hands,</hi> is underſtood any kind of labour, any kind of buſineſſe whatſoever. As it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>that the pleaſure of the Lord did prosper in his hands</hi>; Now the worke that Chriſt had to doe was not a handy worke, yet it did proſper in his hands, that is, he managing and going about it, it did proſper and tooke ſucceſſe; It was effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall for the redemption and ſalvation of his people; This was proſpering of the worke in his hands. In this ſenſe the worke of the head may be called the worke of the hands, the worke of the tongue, the worke of the hands; any worke, any buſineſſe that a man doth, may be called the worke of his hands. So then, <hi>Thou haſt bleſſed the worke of his hands,</hi> that is, thou haſt bleſſed every thing that <hi>Job</hi> goeth about, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, as a Miniſter, or as a Maſter of a Family, in any of, in all his relations, thou haſt cauſed his endeavours to proſper. In the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> an univerſall bleſſing is thus promiſed verſ. 6. <hi>Bleſſed thou ſhalt be when thou commest in, and bleſſed ſhalt thou be when thou goeſt out:</hi> betweene thoſe two are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all the labours and undertakings of that people: by their going forth is meant the beginning of their labours, and by their comming in is meant the end and concluſion of their labours, ſo that beginning and ending, when they ſet their hands to a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and when they tooke their hands from a buſineſſe, they ſhould be bleſſed, that is, they ſhould have a through bleſſing upon all their labours. So here, <hi>Thou hast bleſſed the worke of his hands,</hi> that is, every thing he putteth his hands unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And his ſubſtance is increaſed in the Land.</hi> That is the third thing which Satan doth obſerve here concerning <hi>Job,</hi> that he was not only bleſſed in the eſtate wherein he was, but God did migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily increaſe and multiply his eſtate.<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>He is increaſed in the Land.</hi> The word which we tranſlate <hi>increaſed,</hi> ſignifieth not an ordinary increaſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In immenſum excreſcere.</hi>
                  </note> but ſuch an increaſe as breakes the bounds; it ſignifieth ſo to increaſe in ſuch and abundance, as that the former place where thoſe things were, cannot containe nor hold them, but they muſt ſeeke ſome new place, more roome for them: ſuch a kind of increaſe is here meant. So the word is uſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.12. concerning the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they were afflicted, the Text ſaith, <hi>The more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew</hi>; the ſame word is there uſed,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98733:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſhew the wonderfull increaſe of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were in their affliction. It was ſuch as did breake the bounds. As it is with a river, the more it is ſtopped, the more it ſwelleth and breakes all the bankes and bayes, whatſoever is ſet to hinder the courſe of it: So much is meant in that place of <hi>Moſes</hi> when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſtopped and hindered from their increaſe, they like a river did ſwell over all, they did increaſe ſo as they did breake all the bounds. Thus of <hi>Job, his ſubſtance is increaſed,</hi> it is as if we ſhould ſay in our language, he had ſo much that there was no end of, no roome for his ſubſtance: as the rich foole ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. when his eſtate was increaſed, what ſhall I doe, my barnes are not big enough? I muſt pull them downe and build lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that they may hold my eſtate. So <hi>Jobs</hi> eſtate was ſo increaſed that the compaſſe he had for that preſent could not containe it, he muſt make new folds for his Sheepe they increaſed ſo; and he muſt make greater barnes for his Corne, his fields brought forth ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull croppes; he muſt make larger ſtalles for his Oxen, he muſt build bigger houſes for his family; <hi>he is increaſed,</hi> he is broken forth in the Land. <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.29. When <hi>Tamar</hi> brought forth twins, the Text ſaith, that one put out his hand, and as he drew it back, his brother came out, and therefore they called his name <hi>Pharez,</hi>

So it is in all the workes of mens callings, men may be labouring, and ſweating, and toyling,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98733:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but there is no proſpering, no ſucceeding till God come with a bleſſing. <hi>Thou haſt bleſſed the worke of his hands.</hi> Some take all to themſelves, and thanke their owne labours, their owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, policie and parts.

Satan acknowledgeth, <hi>Thou haſt bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then againe, we may obſerve. <hi>Thou haſt bleſſed the worke of his hands. Every one ought to be a man of imployment.</hi> Every one ought to have ſome buſineſſe to turne his hand unto. In the former part of this Chapter, we reade of <hi>Jobs</hi> piety and holineſſe, and of his zeale in the worſhip of God: Here now we ſee <hi>Jobs</hi> care and diligence in his place and calling wherein God had ſet him, which is called <hi>the worke of his hands.</hi> Every one muſt have two callings, and the one helpeth forward the other; <hi>Job</hi> feared God, and <hi>Job</hi> went on in the buſineſſe which God ſet him. <hi>Job</hi> is ſaid to ſerve God continutlly, and yet <hi>Job</hi> did worke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. Theſe two continualls may well ſtand together: for both the continualls are taken for their ſeaſons; continually, that is ſeaſonably according to the ſeverall opportunities God called him to, and put into his hands. This rebukes thoſe who have no labour, who can ſhew no worke of their hands. It was ſaid to <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him to man-kind, not only as a curſe, but as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhall eate thy bread till thou returne to earth</hi>;<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> this is layed upon all, <hi>In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eate thy bread:</hi> Not that every man is bound to labour in ſuch an employment as cauſeth the face to ſweat: But thereby is meant ſerious labour and imployment in ſome honeſt calling; ſo here the worke of the hands, is taken not ſtrictly, but for any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment wherein <hi>Job</hi> was ſerviceable to God and his Country.</p>
               <p>Put theſe 2 together, <hi>Thou haſt bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>thou hast bleſſed the worke of his hands,</hi> and we may obſerve from both, <hi>That the Lord delighteth to bleſſe thoſe who are induſtrious.</hi> It is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that there is an induſtrious hand but there is a bleſſing of God upon it;<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 4.

a diligent hand; Therefore it is ſaid here, <hi>that God bleſſed the worke of</hi> Jobs <hi>hands. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p and be doing, and the Lord ſhall be with you.</hi> God will not be with us unles we be doing. God doth not love to bleſſe thoſe that are idle; if we be doing, God will be bleſſing, his being with us, is put for his aſſiſting and proſpering us. So it is indeed in all things. God doth not worke, that we ſhould ſit ſtill, nor bleſſe to the intent that we ſhould doe nothing. As it is in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Judges,</hi> They proclaimed <hi>the Sword of the Lord, and of Gideon,</hi> thoſe two muſt goe together. Would you be bleſſed with protection? you muſt labour to protect your ſelves. Doe not thinke that the Lord will protect you with your hands in your pockets, and your Swords ruſting in your ſheathes: while you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in theſe times of danger to defend your ſelves, you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect defence from the Lord; How unbecomming is it for you now to ſtand ſtill and ſay, <hi>Lord helpe us.</hi> We muſt indeed <hi>stand ſtill</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> counſelled the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13.) in regard of feare and diffidence, but beware of ſtanding ſtill in regard of care and diligence, as ever you hope to <hi>ſee the ſalvation of the Lord. The Sword of the Lord and of</hi> Gideon muſt be cried up at once; thoſe two muſt goe together.</p>
               <p>There is a fourth point that we muſt obſerve alſo from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of the two ſentences in the Text. <hi>Thou hast bleſſed the worke of his hands, and his ſubstance is increaſed in the Land. The bleſſing of God where it falleth is effectuall.</hi> If God doth but bleſſe wee ſhall increaſe, there is no queſtion of it; if God doth but bleſſe, we ſhall increaſe mightily. <hi>Thou hast bleſſed him and he is increaſed:</hi> It is the word that followed the firſt bleſſing after the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. <hi>God bleſſed them and ſaid unto them be fruitfull and multiply.</hi> Bleſſing and multiplying goe together; the bleſſing of God is a powerfull bleſſing, <hi>It is mighty in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and carrieth all before it. You know what a ſtrong opinion <hi>Balak</hi> had concerning the bleſſing of <hi>Balaam,</hi> Numb. 22.6. <hi>I wot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that he whom thou bleſſest is bleſſed, and he whom thou curſest is curſed</hi>; A ſtrong conceit, and but a conceit. As there are many at this day as ſtrongly conceited of the bleſſing of that Balaam <hi>of the ſeven hills,</hi> that bleſſing, but curſed Prophet. If they can get but a bleſſing from the Pope, they thinke all is ſafe. If they can but get a bleſſed Sword (ſuch ſome have obtained) to doe a curſed act, to cut the throats of Gods people, or of their Prince, it muſt needs be effectuall; You know there was a bleſſed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98733:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Standard or Banner given to them that came againſt us in 88. and when that Standard was lifted up that Banner diſplayed, with the Popes ſpeciall bleſſing, they accounted, nay called themſelves In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible. Such was their invincible Ignorance, till they were taught better with <hi>Bryars and Thornes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 8.16.</note> or rather with ſtormes and winds fighting againſt them. And though they have bin often cozzen'd, yet ſtill they retaine ſuch an eſteeme of the Popes bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that they travell and throng for it, as for their lives, more then for all manner of riches; I may ſay to them as once that great Cardinall did on the ſame occaſion, <hi>ſeeing this people will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, let them be deceived.</hi> But I deſire to raiſe your eſteeme of Gods bleſſing, for it is a certaine truth, That whom God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth they are bleſſed, Gods bleſſings are fixed and effectuall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; if he bleſſe we ſhall be bleſſed indeed: His bleſſings are ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverſible, as <hi>Balaam</hi> was forced to confeſſe, <hi>Behold hee hath bleſſed and I cannot reverſe it.</hi> If once God hath bleſſed, it is not in Satan, nor in all his lying Prophets, nor in all the power of the creature to alter it, no nor to retard or hinder it for a moment.</p>
               <p>If God now give us the mercy of protection, if he make the hedge about us and bleſſe us in theſe times, we ſhall be continued and eſtabliſhed in the Land; yea we ſhall be increaſed in the Land, we ſhall breake forth abundantly, to the amazement of all hearers and beholders. Though <hi>Rome</hi> curſe, though Hell plot, yet if God bleſſe, we are ſafe.</p>
               <p>This is the thing therefore that we ſhould labour for, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of the bleſſing of God. If we have but that, we have all; let meanes be what they will, great or little, or none at all, if God bleſſe he can make any thing ſerve the turne; any thing with a bleſſing will doe it; any thing with a bleſſing will make us increaſe; yea make us a ſtrong, a mighty, an invincible people. So that Satan and his inſtruments, for very envy ſhall be forced to acknowledge that there is a hedge about us, which they cannot breake through, that there is a wall about us, which they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcale nor batter with all their Engins and Artillery.</p>
               <p>In theſe two <hi>verſes</hi> we have had the anſwer which Satan makes to the Lords queſtion. <hi>Hast thou conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job? You ſee the ſlander that is in it, and how he doth advance the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God upon <hi>Iob,</hi> that he might debaſe the ſervices of <hi>Job</hi> toward God. Now leſt God ſhould take him off preſently with
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98733:67"/>
a denyall, and tell him that all this is falſe; that <hi>Job</hi> is no ſuch man as he repreſents him to be, that he hath moſt preſumptuouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded into Gods peculiar, namely the ſecrets of the heart, (for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had nothing to accuſe him of, that was in ſight, onely he gueſſeth at his heart;) leſt God I ſay ſhould preſently come and check him thus, for his boldneſſe and impudence, both in contradicting his teſtimony and in charging <hi>Job</hi> with inſincerity Satan makes a motion in the next verſe, <hi>Put forth thine hand now and tauch all that he hath and he will curſe thee to thy face:</hi> As if Satan ſhould have ſaid, Lord if you be not ſatisfied that thus it is with your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Job,</hi> if you will not take my word that he is an hypocrite, and that he doth ſerve you only for ends; <hi>doe but ſtretch forth your hand,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>THis 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> containes Satans motion which he ſubjoynes to his Anſwer, verſ. 10. <hi>But put forth thine hand now.</hi> By his Anſwer before he had wounded all the holy ſervices of <hi>Iob,</hi> and now he ſeekes to wound his eſtate and poſſeſſions. His anſwer was full of malice, and his motion is as full of cruelty. Whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had falſely accuſed, he (in theſe words) deſireth may be cauſleſly afflicted. <hi>Put forth thine hand now.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid. There is great queſtion concerning <hi>Jobs</hi> integrity, this one <hi>experiment</hi> will quickly decide and determine it, <hi>Touch all that he hath,</hi> &amp;c. This motion is grounded (as was before noted) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on feared deniall of his anſwer in the former words. For there Satan had argued after this manner, That is an unſound and an hypocriticall profeſſion which is grounded onely upon outward
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98733:68"/>
benefits, but all the profeſſion of <hi>Job</hi> is grounded only upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward benefits, therefore it is unſound. <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>ſerve God for nought?</hi> This is the ſtrength of Satans argument. Now he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the weakneſſe or rather indeed the falſeneſſe, the extreame lye, that was in the Minor, in the Aſſumption (namely, that the profeſſion and holineſſe of <hi>Job</hi> was grounded onely upon outward things,) he (I ſay perceiving that) ſeekes to confirme what he had affirm'd by this motion. If you doubt (ſaith he) whether it be ſo, or no, with <hi>Job,</hi> let that come to the tryall, <hi>touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> The ſtrength of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that lyes in the motion may be thus conceived. That profeſſion is grounded upon outward things which a man layes downe, when outward things are removed and taken away; but if thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things be removed and taken away from <hi>Iob,</hi> he will quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay downe his profeſſion, yea he will take up blaſphemy, he will curſe thee to thy face; therefore the profeſſion of <hi>Iob</hi> is grounded upon outward things. This now is the logick or the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, upon which Satan bottomes and inferres this motion, that ſo he may bring <hi>Iob</hi> upon a further tryall.</p>

                  </note>The Hebrew is, <hi>ſend forth thy hand.</hi> To put foorth the hand, ſignifies, ſometimes to help, and ſometimes to hurt.

               <q>Thy hand.</q>
               <p>The hand of God in Scripture ſignifies, Firſt the purpoſe of God, as that, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.28. <hi>They have done whatſoever thy hand and thy counſell determined before to be done,</hi> that is, whatſoever accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy purpoſe, thou didſt determine. 2. The hand of God ſignifies the Spirit of God, in the mighty actings and workings of it; ſo a Spirit of prophecy is called the hand of God, Ezek. 1.3. <hi>The hand of the Lord was there upon me</hi>; And Ezek. 37.1. <hi>The hand of the Lord was upon me,</hi> that is, the Spirit of the Lord, a mighty power of prophecy was upon me: So likewiſe a ſpirit of ſtrength that is upon a man, is called the hand of God, 1 King. 18. <hi>ult. The hand of the Lord was upon</hi> Elijah <hi>and he girt up his loynes and ran before</hi> Ahab. Here the hand of the Lord is put for the power of the Lord, <hi>put forth thy hand,</hi> that is, <hi>put forth thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>; and ſo the hand of the Lord is uſed often, Iſa. 59.1. <hi>The hand of the Lord is not ſhortened,</hi> that is, the power of the Lord is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. The Lord hath a long hand, and his hand is alwayes of the ſame length; ſo, ſtretch forth thine hand now, that is, doe thou put forth thy mighty power.</p>
               <p>This hand of the Lords power (to cleare that a little further) is taken 3 wayes in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For his <hi>protecting power.</hi> There is a protecting hand, as Joh. 10.28. <hi>No man is able to plucke them out of my Fathers hand,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt.</hi> God hath his ſheepe in his hand, and he will protect and ſafeguard them ſo, that none ſhall be able to plucke them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. This hand God put forth before, for <hi>Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, It is put for his <hi>correcting-power:</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.4. <hi>His hand was heavy upon me, that is, the afflicting hand of God was heavy upon me. Let us fall into the hand of God (David</hi> choſe that, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14.) that is, into the afflicting hand of God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than into the hands of men.</p>
               <p>It is put thirdly for a <hi>revenging hand,</hi> for a wrathfull hand, by which he doth deſtroy and breake in peeces thoſe who are his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98733:69"/>
Heb. 10.31. <hi>It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the living God. David</hi> deſireth to fall into the hands of God, <hi>ſell.</hi> into his correcting hand, becauſe he knew there was mercy, but it is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of God, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in wrath to take vengeance of thoſe who contemptuouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe his mercy, as there it is expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Now here when Satan ſaith, <hi>Put forth thy hand,</hi> that is thine hand of power: Satan intendeth not that God ſhould put forth the hand of his power to protect, nor barely to correct: He deſireth more then barely a correcting or chaſtiſing hand upon <hi>Job,</hi> he would have his revenging hand, his breaking, his deſtroying hand, as we ſhall ſee afterward.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>Thy hand,</hi> that is, Gods owne hand, as if he did deſire that God himſelfe would take <hi>Job</hi> into his own hand to chaſten and puniſh him.</p>
               <p>The hand of God, his correcting or chaſtiſing hand ſometimes is an immediate, and ſometimes a mediate hand. Sometimes it is immediate, when God by himſelf doth chaſten or puniſh or afflict, when no ſecond cauſe doth appeare or interveene. So it may ſeem Satan here meanes, when he ſaith, <hi>put forth thine hand,</hi> that is, doe it thine owne ſelfe, let no other have the handling of <hi>Job,</hi> but thy ſelfe. God doth ſend ſuch immediate afflictions; a man is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in his body, in his eſtate and many other wayes, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find any thing in the creature, whence it ſhould come; it is an immediate ſtroke of God, he cannot ſee how or which way, or at what doore this evill came in upon him: therefore it is called a <hi>creating of evill,</hi> Iſa. 45.7. <hi>I make peace and create evill.</hi> Now creation is out of nothing, there is nothing out of which it is wrought. So many times God bringeth evill upon a people or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when there is no appearance of ſecond cauſes, no matter out of which it is made, but it comes as a creature, formed by the only hand of God. Sometimes likewiſe it is called Gods hands, when it is the hand of a creature, it is Gods hand in a creatures hand; Gods hand when it is the hand of wicked men, Gods hand when it is Satans hand. So that place is tranſlated, Pſal. 17.14. <hi>Deliver my ſoule from the wicked which is thy Sword</hi> (you ſee a wicked man is Gods Sword) <hi>and from men which are thy hand.</hi> So that <hi>thy hand</hi> may be underſtood of an inſtrument; Satan himſelfe is Gods hand to puniſh in that ſenſe, as wicked men here are ſaid to be Gods hand; <hi>from the men that are thy hand:</hi> though there be
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98733:69"/>
other readings of that place, ſome reade it, <hi>deliver me from men by thy hand</hi>; and others, <hi>Deliver mee from men of thy hand:</hi> but our tranſlation may very well carry the ſenſe of the Originall in it, <hi>from men which are thy hand,</hi> as <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> that wicked King is called <hi>Gods ſervant,</hi> Jer. 43.10. <hi>I will ſend and take</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>my ſervant</hi>; God ſpeakes of him as his ſervant, or as his hand in the thing. So then, <hi>Put forth thine hand,</hi> it may be underſtood (I ſay) either immediately or mediately, doe it by thy ſelfe or doe it by Inſtruments, ſtrike him thy ſelfe, or give me Commiſſion, or give others Commiſſion to ſtrike.</p>

               </p>
               <q>And touch all that he hath.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>To touch,</hi> notes ſometimes a heavy and a ſore affliction, and ſometime a light and a ſmall affliction. In the Scripture we find it both wayes uſed. Sometimes (I ſay) <hi>to touch,</hi> doth ſignifie, the greateſt and the ſoreſt affliction or puniſhment that can be; and ſo <hi>Job</hi> doth expreſſe all the afflictions that fell upon him at the laſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by touching, <hi>Job</hi> 19.21. <hi>Have pitty upon me, have pitty upon me, O yee my friends, for the hand of God hath touched me.</hi> Whereas <hi>Job</hi> at that time lay under the ſoreſt and heavieſt affliction that could be, all his eſtate was gone, and his body was full of diſeaſes, and his ſoule was full of horrour, and all this he doth expreſſe by this, <hi>the hand of the Lord hath touched me.</hi> So Pſalm. 73.14. To be touched ſignifies the greateſt affliction, <hi>All the day long</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) have I been plagued.</hi> That which we tranſlate <hi>plagued,</hi> is the ſame Originall word which we tranſlate <hi>touch,</hi> in the Text; <hi>All the day long have I beene touched,</hi> that is, <hi>I have beene touched with the ſoreſt plagues,</hi> heavy afflictions have beene laid continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon me. So that to <hi>touch</hi> ſignifieth ſometimes the greateſt or the ſoreſt ſtroakes of trouble.</p>
               <p>Sometimes againe we ſhall find it ſignifies only a <hi>light affliction,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. in two places of that Chapter, at the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech charged all his people, ſaying, he that toucheth this man or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98733:70"/>
his wife, ſhall ſurely be put to death,</hi> that is, he that doth them the leaſt <hi>hurt</hi> or <hi>wrong.</hi> So at the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, in that agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> they conclude thus, <hi>That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee nothing but good</hi>: So that to touch notes the leaſt ill or hurt that can be, <hi>wee have not touched thee,</hi> that is, we have <hi>done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thee but good:</hi> Any thing on this ſide doing of good to them, had bin touching of them. We find the like expreſſion in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 105.15. where the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaking of Gods extraordinary care of his people. <hi>He ſuffered no man to do them wrong, he rebuked Kings for their ſakes, ſaying, touch not mine annointed, and doe my Prophets no harme. Touch not</hi> mine annointed people, that is the meaning of that place, though in many other places we know Princes are called the annointed of God: yet here it is meant of the people of God in generall, they are Gods annoynted (as the context clearely carries it) for they have all received Unction from God, an Unction of grace, an Unction of the ſpirit, and an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Priviledge. <hi>Touch not mine annoynted,</hi> that is, doe them not the leaſt hurt. And the ſenſe that theſe words may beare, <hi>Put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath,</hi> might be carried, as if Satan here intended, only a touch in the latter ſenſe; Give him but the leaſt ſtroake, lay but the lighteſt affliction upon him, doe but touch him; you are ſo confident of your ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> that he is ſuch a man, do but give him the leaſt touch, and you ſhall ſee how he will diſcover himſelf. So ſome expound it.</p>
               <p>He doth not ſay, <hi>wound him, ſmite him, breake him to peeces,</hi> but <hi>touch him</hi> only.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Si vel extremo digitulo leviſſi mè tangas bona ſua, ejus fictum animum &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulatam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitatem mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtè comperies.</hi>
                  </note> Neither ſaith he, touch him, but his: And if thou give him but a touch with the top of thy little finger, thou ſhalt preſently find the rottennes of his heart. In that ſenſe the word imports an extenuation of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſincerity or heightning of <hi>Jobs</hi> hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie: as if he had been ſo rotten in his profeſſion that the leaſt touch would overthrow him, and make him diſcover himſelfe to be ſtarke nought. Like the Apples growing about <hi>Sodome,</hi> which have faire out-ſides, but if you touch them, they moulder away into duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p>Though the words have this ſenſe in them, and Satan carries it cunningly, expreſſing himſelfe in ſuch ambiguous termes, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Satan had a further intendment whatſoever his language may beare: he had an intention that <hi>Job</hi> ſhould be touched in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe, namely that he ſhould have a touch to the quicke, as we
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98733:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſay, that he ſhould have the ſoreſt and deepeſt wound that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate was capable of: he would have him whippt, not with cords, but with Scorpions, he would have the little finger of God heavier upon him, than his loynes upon others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſtroy him,</hi> undoe him by your <hi>touching.</hi> He ſpeakes by the figure <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is when we go leſſe in our expreſſions then in our intentions, when our words are lower then our ſpirits: and that is proper for Satan, who is the great deceiver, the great jugler in word and deed; to deſire that <hi>Job</hi> ſhould only be touched, when he meant he ſhould be utterly undone and ruined. <hi>Touch all that he hath,</hi> that is, all his eſtate, all his poſſeſſions, his children, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, his cattell, whatſoever belongeth unto <hi>Job,</hi> let all feele an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing ſtroake from thy hand.</p>
               <p>Before I come to that which he undertakes upon the affliction, I ſhall obſerve two or three things from the words, thus farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Put forth NOW thine hand.</hi> We may note from that, <hi>The extreame importunity of Satan to doe miſchiefe</hi>; He would not give God a minuts, not a moments reſpite to conſider this thing, but doe it now, preſently, let him preſently be afflicted, he makes <hi>haſte to deſtroy,</hi> he makes <hi>haſte to ſhed bloud, their feet are ſwift to ſhed bloud,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeakes. So Satan, his feet are ſwift to ſhed bloud. when Satan, would have God to afflict us, doe it preſently, ſaith he. when Satan, would have us ſinne againſt God, doe it preſently, ſaith he, now ſinne, now provoke God, doe not ſtay till the next day; but when we are called to give up our ſelves to God, then to morrow will ſerve the turne, and next yeare will ſerve to repent, yea when you are old, 'tis time enough to repent; when he tempteh to doe any miſchiefe, any ſinne, then now, now ſin, but 'tis time enough to doe good hereafter, to morrow will ſerve for that.</p>
               <q>Put forth now thine hand, and touch all that he hath.</q>
               <p>It is a truth which Satan here ſpeakes concerning the hand of God; <hi>That if God doe but touch the higheſt and greateſt eſtate in the world, it will fall to peeces quickly.</hi> There is a truth in it, take it in the eaſieſt ſenſe that can be, if God doe but lightly touch the eſtate of a man, it will ſoone fall in peeces. God is not put to any ſtreſſe to afflict and puniſh, as Pſal. 81.14. <hi>I ſhould ſoone have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued their enemies and have turned my hand againſt their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries:</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:98733:71"/>
God expreſſeth the utter over-throw of the enemies of his people, but by the <hi>turning of a hand,</hi> if God doe but turne his hand, they are all gone preſently, ſoone ſubdued; If he doe but touch the might the pompe the greatneſſe, the riches and the power of all thoſe in the world that are oppoſers of his Church, preſently they fall to the ground: A touch from the hand of God will end our warres. If he touch the Mountaines they ſmoake (as it is in the <hi>Pſalme</hi>) and conſume to aſhes: they that are the mighty and great ones of the world, the Mountaines, by one touch of his hand fall as it were to nothing. So if God doe but touch our eſtates, they moulder away, no creature can uphold them.</p>
               <p>Then againe obſerve here, the cunning impoſture of Satan that puts ſuch ſore, ſuch heavy afflictions into ſuch light and eaſie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; he cloatheth his malice, his utmoſt malice here in very faire words, doe but touch him, ſaith this enimie; but you ſee what Satans touches are, <hi>touch all that he hath.</hi> Why Satan, would nothing have made a tryall, but only a touching of all? For <hi>Job</hi> to have loſt ſomewhat had been a tryall, a touch: for <hi>Job</hi> to have loſt halfe his flockes of Sheepe, or his Oxen, had been a tryall and no very light one neither; for <hi>Job</hi> to have loſt a ſonne, to have found one of his children ſuddenly ſtrucke dead, had been an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and a heavy one too; ſuch a touch as that might well have touched the fathers heart: Would it not ſerve Satan that a ſonne ſhould die or that ſome of his cattell ſhould be deſtroyed, but he muſt have all touched, <hi>all that he hath?</hi> The malice of Satan is unſatiable, there is nothing will ſerve him, unleſſe he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure all.</p>
               <p>This touch of Satan, which he deſireth might be laid upon <hi>Job,</hi> is like the touch that many have given to thoſe, who have come into their hands amongſt us; they would but touch them, but they would touch them in all; when they put forth their hands (as they pretended) in wayes of juſtice, in their Courts; they would touch men in all, touch them in their liberties by impriſonment, and touch them in their eſtates by extreame vaſt fines, and touch them in their names by diſgrace, touch them in their bodies by whipping and cutting, and touch them in their relations, by keeping all friends from ſight of them. No moderation, no bounds, but touch them in all that they had. And (O exactneſſe of Juſtice) when God came to touch that power, he gave them a touch, juſt after the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98733:71"/>
rate and proportion of their owne touches; for when thoſe Courts and perſons came to have their power and actions ſcanned, it was not moderating, or regulating, or reſtraining, or abating, or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their power, that ſatisfied, they muſt quite downe and be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. God gave them a touch, juſt as they touched others before: So that a man may ſay certainly, there is a God that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the earth. Theſe are the touches of Satan and, the touches of mercileſſe men are as like his as themſelves are, they thinke there is nothing done unleſſe men be undone: they never give over touching till they come to ruining.</p>
               <q>Touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</q>

There is ſuch an <hi>emphaſis</hi> in that manner of ſpeaking uſed in the Text. But we tranſlate it by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect affirmation, and that is a good ſenſe too, <hi>touch all that he hath and he will curſe thee to thy face,</hi> that's certaine, ſo ſaith Satan, he will doe it: it is as ſure as done already.</p>
               <q>Curſe thee.</q>
               <p>It is the ſame word which is uſed before, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>It may be my children have curſed God.</hi> The word ſignifies properly to bleſſe. It was ſhewed that probably in that place, it might be tranſlated <hi>Curſe</hi>; but in this Text there is a neceſſity of tranſlating it ſo, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cleare ſence cannot be made out, taking the word properly. In curſing another theſe three things concurre. Firſt an ill opinion or conceit of that perſon. 2. Hatred or malice againſt him. 3. A
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98733:72"/>
deſire that ſome evill may befall him. This Satan meanes when he undertakes that <hi>Job</hi> being afflicted, will curſe God. So then to curſe God is to blaſpheme God in our thoughts and words, to think or ſpeake unworthily of God, and the wayes of God; ſee, if he curſe thee not to thy face, that is, ſee if his heart be not imbittered againſt thee, ſee if his tongue be not ſharpened to wound thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to reproach thy goodneſſe, to accuſe thy providence: As it is ſaid of thoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.21. <hi>They ſhall be hungry and hard beſtead</hi>; And what then? <hi>They ſhall fret themſelves and curſe their King and their God, and looke upward,</hi> that is, they ſhall ſpeake baſely of their King and of their God, in whom they have truſted, and whom they have followed; he ſpeakes of thoſe wretches that did ſeeke to falſe gods, or worſhip the true God falſely, they ſhall curſe their King and their God. It is the very ſame, that here Satan promiſeth himſelfe and undertakes with God that <hi>Job</hi> will doe; Doe but make him hungry (ſaith he) and hard beſtead, and he will fret himſelf, and curſe thee.</p>
               <p>It was very ordinary among the Heathen to doe ſo: when their gods did not pleaſe them, then they would curſe their gods. The Poets bring them in often raging againſt their gods, as he ſpeakes of the mother that found her ſonne dead.<note place="margin">

He had no regard to thy worſhip in his heart; he did not worſhip thee <hi>ex a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo,</hi> becauſe he loved thee or delighted in thee, but gave thee an outward complemental bleſſing, becauſe thou didſt bleſſe him out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. As the Apoſtle directs ſervants, Eph. 6.6. <hi>Not with eye ſervice as men pleaſers.</hi> Satan makes <hi>Job</hi> an eye-ſervant to God, or as if, like thoſe of whom Chriſt complaineth, <hi>Math.</hi> 15. in the words of the Prophet, <hi>He had drawne nigh to God with his lipps, while his heart was farre from him.</hi> The heart of <hi>Job</hi> hath beene
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98733:72"/>
farre enough from thee, he only bleſſed thee with his lips and to thy face: Indeed this interpretation hath a faire face, but touch it by a ſerious examination, and it will be found without a heart. The conſtruction of Gramar is quite againſt it, and for us to change the Text, and make it to ſpeake in the Preterperfect tenſe, of a thing paſt, whereas the words are in the future tenſe, of an act to be done for the time to come, is too much boldneſſe with Scripture. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though that opinion hath a plauſible ſenſe in it, yet I ſhall lay it by and take the ordinary tranſlation, that he indeed intended this, that <hi>Job</hi> would breake forth into blaſphemous revilings of God, if God did but try him with an affliction.</p>
               <p>And when he ſaith that <hi>Job</hi> would doe it <hi>to his face,</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it is, that he would doe it openly: he will curſe thee open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he will curſe thee boldly, he will not goe behind the doore to tell tales of thee, but he will ſpeake of it before all the world, that thou art a cruell God, an unjuſt God, and a hard maſter, he will tell ſuch tales of thee, even to thy very face. We have a like ſpeech, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>When</hi> Peter <hi>was come to</hi> Antioch, <hi>I withſtood him to the face</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi>) that is, openly, I did not goe behind his backe to tell <hi>Peter</hi> his owne, but I told him it to his face, plainly, openly before them all, (as it is explained, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.) <hi>I ſaid to</hi> Peter <hi>before them all,</hi> that were then preſent. <hi>Jerome</hi> (becauſe he would not have <hi>Peter</hi> receive ſuch an open repoofe, jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it would be a diſparagement to <hi>Peter,</hi> to be rebuked by <hi>Paul</hi>) gives a quite contrary ſenſe of thoſe words of <hi>Paul; I withstood him to his face,</hi> that is ſaith he, I did ſpeake ſomewhat roughly to him before them, but there was no ſuch thing in my heart. I did it but to his face, very ſlightly, leaſt I ſhould offend the <hi>Jewes</hi> whoſe Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was; and <hi>I did it to his face,</hi> a little, that I might ſatisfie the Gentiles, who were ſcandalized by <hi>Peters</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: otherwiſe in my heart I had no quarrell with <hi>Peter:</hi> he and I agreed well enough. As if <hi>Paul</hi> had made but a ſhadow fight <hi>(ad faciendum populum)</hi> to delude the people. But we muſt not be thus wiſe, <hi>I withſtood him to his face,</hi> is not oppoſed to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding him cordially, but to a withſtanding of him ſecretly, or behind his backe.

               </p>
               <p>We may give ſome exemplifications, what it is to curſe God, to blaſpheme God thus to his face.

Ye have ſaid, It is vaine to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> &amp;c. This is to curſe God to his face: when the wayes of God are blaſphemed and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God reported as unprofitable, when men ſay it is in vaine to ſerve God, when they caſt aſperſions and bring up an evill name upon any holy duty, this is to blaſpheme God. They did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake againſt the ſervice of God, and they thought they had not blaſphemed God in it, <hi>Wherein have we ſpoken againſt thee?</hi> yes ſaith God, you have ſpoken againſt me, in that you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt and diſcredited my wayes. So, if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid the wayes of God are unprofitable, and I ſee now it is in vaine to ſerve God and to feare him, this had beene blaſphemy and curſing of God to his face. <hi>David</hi> was neare upon the very brinke of this blaſphemie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13. when he ſaid, <hi>I have cleanſed my heart in vaine, and waſhed my hands in innocency, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am plagued every morning</hi>; the judgements and afflictions that were upon him, began to make him breake out thus. But he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be fooles himſelfe for ſuch ſpeeches, and by that repaires God in his honour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To quarrell and be angry with the Providence of God, as if he were not wiſe or juſt or good in his diſpenſations either to particular perſons or to the Church, This I ſay likewiſe is a curſing, a reproaching of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To curſe the ſervants and people of God is to curſe God; If he that touches them touches God, then he that curſeth them curſeth God too. And God is curſed in any of theſe ſenſes two wayes, firſt, by detracting from himſelfe, his worſhip, his workes or his ſervants the good they have, or by faſtning on them and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing them with the evill which they have not.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:98733:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>Hee will curſe thee to thy face.</q>
               <p>Obſerve two or three Points from this,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Note this, <hi>Satan can only gueſſe at the hearts of men.</hi> Hee would undertake and enter warranty with God that <hi>Job</hi> would blaſpheme, if God did but touch him, but he was deceived: Satan did but conjecture at moſt, and ſpeake at a venture, If he did not lie knowingly, I am ſure he did but gueſſe ignorantly. Satan knowes not what is in the heart, that's Gods peculiar, that's Gods cabinet. God knew there lay ſincerity in the heart of <hi>Job</hi> all the while, although Satan would ſtand to it, that nothing was there but hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Wee may note, ſeeing Satan accuſing him of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, would have him afflicted, <hi>That affliction is the tryall and touchſtone of ſincerity.</hi> When God doth afflict you, then he doth bring you to the touchſtone to ſee whether you are good mettall or no, he doth bring you then to the furnace, to try whether you be droſſe or gold, or what you are. <hi>Affliction is the great diſcoverer,</hi> That unmaskes us. Satan was not out in the thing, he hit upon the righteſt way that could be, if any thing would diſcover <hi>Job,</hi> affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would. Indeed ſome are diſcovered by proſperity and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward abundance. The warme Sunne makes ſome caſt off that cloake, which the winde and the cold cauſed them to wrap clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer about them. Some, when they have gotten enough from God, care not for God; when the fiſh is caught, they lay by the net, for they doe but goe a fiſhing with Holynes, and the profeſſion of Religion, and when they have their ends, ther's an end of their profeſſion. Affliction and the croſſe try others: Some will hold on with God as long as the Sunne ſhineth, as long as it is faire weather; but if the ſtorme ariſe, if troubles come, whether perſonall or publike, then they pull in their heads, then they deny and forſake God, then they draw backe from and betray his truth; what they, ſuch and ſuch men? no not they. Trouble makes the great tryall; bring profeſſors to the fire, and then they ſhew their mettall. This courſe Satan took with <hi>Job.</hi> He knew <hi>Job</hi> had bin abundantly tryed by fullneſſe and abundance, and theſe did not draw his heart from God, he muſt therefore now try another way. It is an excellent paſſage in the Church hiſtory, concerning <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the father of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> that to the end he might try the hearts of his Courtiers, he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98733:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proclaimed, that all they who would not forſake the worſhip of the true God, ſhould be baniſhed the Court, and ſhould have heavy penalties and fines layed upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preſently upon this (ſaith the ſtory) all that were baſe and came to ſerve him only for ends, went away, forſooke the true God, and worſhipped Idols. by this meanes he found out who were the true ſervants of God, and whom he meant to make his owne; ſuch as he found faithfull to God he thought would prove faithfull to him. What this explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorie decree of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> effected in his Court, the ſame did that which the Apoſtate <hi>Julian</hi> ſet forth in good earneſt againſt the Chriſtians.<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. Socrat <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</note> He no ſooner cauſed it to be proclaimed, that whoſoever would not renounce the Faith ſhould be diſcarded his ſervice, and forfeit both life and eſtate to his high diſpleaſure; But preſently upon the publication of that decree, they who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Chriſtians, and they who had only the title of Chriſtians, preſented themſelves, as it were on a common ſtage to the view of all men. Such as theſe are Willows not Oakes. And as it was with <hi>Naomi</hi> and her two daughters in law, <hi>Orpah</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> All the while that ſhe was <hi>Naomi, beautifull,</hi> and had enough, they both ſtayed with her: but when once <hi>Naomi</hi> became <hi>Marah,</hi> bitter, and empty, then <hi>Orpah</hi> tooke her leave of her, but <hi>Ruth</hi> abides with her. Here was the tryall whether <hi>Orpah</hi> or <hi>Ruth</hi> had the ſincerer affection to <hi>Naomi; Ruth</hi> loved her mothers perſon, <hi>Orpah</hi> her eſtate and outward preferments. While Religion and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity goe together it is hard to ſay which a man followes; but when once they are forced to a ſeparation, where the heart was will ſoone be manifeſt. The upright in heart are like <hi>Ruth,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever becommeth of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> they will be ſharers with it in the ſame condition; be it affliction, or be it proſperity, be it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or be it ſorrow, be it faire weather or be it foule, be it light or be it darkneſſe they will take their lot with it. This is a cleare truth, that, whatſoever was the cauſe of our doing a thing, that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved we ceaſe to doe it: if outward comforts and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in the world, be the cauſe why we follow Chriſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Goſpell, then as ſoone as ever they faile our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion will faile too. When zeale is kindled only with the beames of worldly hopes, when worldly hopes faile, our zeale is extinct, and our indeavour is cut off with our expectation.</p>
               <p>Wee are next to conſider the Lords grant of Satans motion, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, behold all that he hath is in thy
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98733:74"/>
power, only upon himſelfe put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have in this verſe. Firſt, Gods Commiſſion or his permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto Satan, <hi>Behold all that he hath is in thine hand.</hi> And Secondly, His limitation of the Commiſſion, <hi>Onely upon himſelfe put not forth thine hand.</hi> Thirdly, Satans ſpeedy execution of his Commiſſion, <hi>So Satan went forth from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Satan, all that he hath is in thy hand, in thy power,</hi> ſo we tranſlate it: the word in the Originall is, <hi>all is in thy hand.</hi> Satan mooved that God would put forth his hand againſt <hi>Job</hi>; and God puts <hi>Job</hi> into Satans hand. Leaſt Satan ſhould cavill that God had toucht him but lightly, he puts him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satans power and lets him doe it himſelfe, <hi>who would doe it throughly.</hi> The hand (as we before noted) is put for power, and when any thing is put into the hand, it is put into the power or diſpoſition of another, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt doe all the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders before</hi> Pharaoh <hi>which I have put into thy hand.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.35. <hi>The Father loveth the Sonne and hath given all things into his hand.</hi> This phraſe of giving or putting into the hand, is taken either for good or for evill. Sometime the putting of a thing into ones hand, is only for the managing and diſpoſing of it for good, As <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.7, 8. Joſeph <hi>ſaid that his master had committed all that he had into his hand,</hi> that is, to take care of it, and to order it for his maſters benefit, profit, and honour: But often to put or to give into the hand, is for evill, to doe what you will, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or things, to puniſh or to afflict them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.1. God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into the hand of <hi>Midian,</hi> that is, he left them to the power of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> to tyrannize over and vexe them: And <hi>verſe</hi> 7.<note place="margin">Dan. 1.2.</note> God delivered <hi>Midian</hi> into the hand of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that is, hee gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> power over them to deſtroy or afflict them. So here, he gave all into the hand of Satan, that is, he gave Satan leave to diſpoſe of <hi>Jobs</hi> eſtate as he pleaſed. As if God had ſaid to Satan; Thou haſt leave to doe what thou wilt with <hi>Jobs</hi> outward eſtate, ſpoile it, plunder it, deſtroy it, conſume it, fire it; thou haſt free leave, <hi>all that he hath is in thy hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall note a point or two from that. You ſee, as ſoone as ever Satan had made his motion, God preſently anſwereth, <hi>all that he hath is in thy hand. It is not alwayes an argument of Gods goodwill and love to have our motions granted.</hi> Many are heard
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98733:75"/>
and anſwered out of anger, not out of love. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> required <hi>meat for their luſts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Multi irato Deo exaudiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, multis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius Deus non tribuit quod vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt, ut quod utile eſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buat,</hi> Auguſt. 2 Cor. 12.8.</note> and God gave it them, he did not withhold from them their deſire, they were not ſhortned of their luſts, they had it preſently: many times his owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants call and call againe, move and move againe, and obtaine no grant: <hi>For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> yet <hi>Paul</hi> could not have what he ſought. Satan did but move once, and preſently all that <hi>Job</hi> had was in his hand.</p>
               <p>But further, that which is chiefely here to be obſerved is, <hi>That untill God gives commiſſion, Satan hath no power over the eſtates or perſons of Gods people, or over any thing that belongs unto them.</hi> Neither our perſons nor our eſtates are ſubject to the will either of men or Devills; Chriſt muſt ſay, <hi>All that he hath is in thy hand,</hi> before Satan can touch a ſhoe-latchet: As Chriſt ſaid <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.11. unto <hi>Pilat,</hi> when he ſpake ſo ſtoutly, <hi>knoweſt thou not that I have power to crucifie thee and power to releaſe thee?</hi> He thought that he had all power in his hand: but Chriſt tells him, <hi>Thou couldeſt have no power at all against me unleſſe it were given thee from above.</hi> If the Devills could not goe into the ſwine, much leſſe can they meddle with a man, made after Gods Image, till God gives them leave, Every ſoule that hath intereſt in Chriſt may ſuck comfort and conſolation in the ſaddeſt, in the ſorrowfulleſt day from the breaſt of this truth. If Satan and wicked men cannot move till Chriſt ſaith, goe, nor wound till Chriſt ſaith ſtrike, nor ſpoile nor kill, till Chriſt ſaith their eſtates, their lives are in your power, ſurely Chriſt will not ſpeake a word to their hurt, whom he lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, nor will he ever ſuffer his enemies to doe a reall dammage to his friends. Beſides it may fill the ſoule with unſpeakeable joy, to remember, that while a man is ſuffering, the will of Chriſt is a doing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Satan doth very wickedly (according to his nature,) in moving that <hi>Job</hi> may be afflicted. He moveth in malice and in ſpight, God knew what his heart and intent was, and yet grants it; We may note from hence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which Satan and evill men deſire ſinnefully, the Lord grants holily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The will of God and the will of Satan joyned both in the ſame thing; yet they were as different as light and darkeneſſe, their ends were as different as their natures. Though it were the ſame thing they both willed, yet there was an infinite diſtance betweene them in willing it. The will of Satan was ſinfull, but the power
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98733:75"/>
given Satan was juſt Why? Becauſe his will was from (himſelfe, but his power was from the will of God; Satan had no power to doe miſchiefe but what God gave him, but his will to doe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe was from himſelfe. Therefore we find that the ſame ſpirit is ſaid to be an evill ſpirit, and to be a ſpirit from the Lord, and yet the Lord doth not partake at all in the evill of the ſpirit, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord departed from</hi> Saul <hi>and an evill ſpirit from the Lord troubled him.</hi> An evill ſpirit from the Lord,<note place="margin">

In that he was evill that was from his own will, but that he had power to trouble <hi>Saul</hi> that was from the Lord: So here, Satans will and intent were moſt wicked, theſe were from himſelfe; his power to afflict <hi>Job</hi> was from God, and that was good. Satan willeth <hi>Job</hi> ſhould be afflicted for his deſtruction, God willeth it only for his tryall and probation. Satan deſireth it that God may be blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but God willeth it that himſelfe might be glorified.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Satanae volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas ſemper ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua eſt ſed nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam poteſt as injuſta,</hi> Greg. <hi>Deus adeo bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus eſt ut nullo modo mala per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteret niſi inde majora bona eliciturus eſſet.</hi>
                  </note> Satan willeth it, that ſo others in his example might be ſcandalized and diſheartned from entring into the ſervice of God, ſeeing how ill he ſped; But God willeth it that others might be ſtrengthned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to enter into his ſervice, beholding a man under ſuch heavy preſſures, and yet not ſpeaking ill of God or of his wayes. Satan willeth it, hoping thereby <hi>Job</hi> would diſcover his hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; but God willeth it, knowing that he would therein diſcover his integrity. So then, though the ſame thing was willed, yet there was a vaſt diſproportion in their ends and intentions; and though the power by which Satan did afflict <hi>Job</hi> was from God, yet the evill intent with which he afflicted him was from himſelfe; Thus we ſee how God without any ſtaine or touch of evill grants this, which Satan did moſt wickedly deſire. It followeth
<q>Onely upon himſelfe thou ſhalt not put forth thy hand.</q>
               </p>
               <p>God gives a commiſſion, but it is with a limitation, there is a reſtriction in it; <hi>Onely upon himſelfe,</hi> &amp;c. that is, not upon his perſon, not his body, thou ſhalt not afflict that with diſeaſes, not his ſoule, thou ſhalt not afflict that with temptations. Hence note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God himſelfe ſets bounds to the afflictions of his people</hi>; he limits out how farre every affliction ſhall goe, and how farre every inſtrument ſhall prevaile: as he doth with the Sea, <hi>Hitherto</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:98733:76"/>
(ſaith he) <hi>thou ſhalt come and no further, here thou ſhalt ſtop thy proud waves</hi>; ſo he ſaith to all the afflictions of ſingle perſons, or whole Nations, hither you ſhall come and no further, <hi>Onely upon himſelfe thou ſhalt not put forth thine hand.</hi> This limitation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; Firſt, The degree or meaſure, thus farre you ſhall afflict, that is, in ſuch a degree, to ſuch a height, and no higher. Secondly, It reſpects the time, thus farre, that is, thus long, ſo many yeares, or ſo many dayes you ſhall have power and no longer. God leaves not either the meaſure or the time, the degree or the continuance of any affliction in the hand of Satan or his adherents: Wee reade (<hi>Rev.</hi> 6.10.) <hi>That the ſouls under the Altar cry, How long Lord, how long?</hi> They cry to God <hi>how long?</hi> they knew that he only had the time in his hand, he only could tell how long, and it ſhould be as long as he pleaſed, <hi>How long Lord?</hi> They cryed not to cruell tyrants, how long will ye perſecute? but Lord how long will it be before thou come to revenge? And ſo <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 31.15. <hi>My time it is in thy hand,</hi> ſpeaking of his afflictions. There is no affliction, but it is in the hand of God, for the continuance of it as well as for the manner of it; and as no enemie, man or devill can make thy croſſe greater or longer, or heavier, ſo no friend man or Angell can make thy croſſe lighter, or leſſer, or ſhorter then God himſelfe hath appointed; <hi>Onely upon himſelfe ſhalt thou not put forth thine hand,</hi> thou ſhalt not move an inch further, not a haires bredth further. As our afflictions for the matter of them are by the will of God, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. <hi>While you ſuffer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>according to the will of God:</hi> thoſe words <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God,</hi> note not only the righteouſneſſe of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, that it muſt be in a good cauſe, but alſo the ſpring from whence thoſe ſufferings come, they are <hi>Ex voluntate Dei,</hi> ſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlates it, they are out of the will of God. Now I ſay as they are out of the will of God, or from the will of God, ſpringing from his will and flowing from his diſpenſation of things in the matter of them) ſo alſo in every circumſtance; God himſelf gives thy croſſe length, and bredth, and thickneſſe; he fills thy cup of ſorrow, he directeth how many drops to a drop, ſhall be put into it, thou ſhalt not have a drop more then God preſcribes, and (which is more comfortable) knowes will be for thy good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>That Satan is boundleſſe in his malice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the people of God.</hi> If God did not ſet him bounds, he would ſet himſelfe no bounds, therefore ſaith God unto him, <hi>Onely upon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98733:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himſelfe,</hi> &amp;c. He had a mind to have gone further, he would have been upon <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe, as well as upon his eſtate, if God had not ſtop'd and curb'd him. Therefore the Apoſtle gives that aſſurance for the comfort of the people of God, 1 Cor. 10.13. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is faithfull who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Satan would with all his heart lay more upon you, than you are able to beare; Satan would breake your backs if he were let alone, but God will not ſuffer it. Satan hath a boundleſſe malice againſt the people of God. Some obſerve this from his name <hi>Leviathan,</hi> Iſa. 27.1. <hi>In that day the Lord with his great and ſtrong Sword ſhall puniſh Leviathan the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Serpent. Leviathan</hi> is put there for Satan and for all the inſtruments of Satan; now <hi>Leviathan</hi> ſignifieth in the Hebrew an <hi>augmentation,</hi> an <hi>addition,</hi> or an <hi>increaſe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

His thirſt to worke miſchiefe is never quenched, but ſtill he deſires to doe more, he would faine have his Commiſſion inlarged to doe more miſchiefe in the world. Therefore God is ſaid not to ſtrike after their ſtroake, in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of that 27. of <hi>Iſa. Hath hee ſmitten him as he ſmit thoſe that ſmote him?</hi> In the Hebrew it is, <hi>Hee hath not ſmitten him according to the ſtroake of thoſe that ſmote him: according to their ſtroake,</hi> noting that the ſtroake of <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and the ſtroake of his inſtruments is an unmeaſurable ſtroake, a boundleſſe ſtroake, they would never give over ſtriking: They thinke the wound is never deepe enough, nor blood ſhed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but ſaith the Prophet, verſe 8. <hi>God doth it in meaſure,</hi> ſo that he oppoſeth their ſtriking to Gods afflicting by the meaſure of it, God keepeth his afflictions in ſuch a bound and compaſſe, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts in meaſure, but Satans ſtroake and the ſtroakes of wicked men are without all meaſure, that is without all moderation: unleſſe God ſtop them, they would never make an end.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Obſerve how Satan is by this proved a deceiver, he intended more than he ſpake; you may ſee it plainly in this, becauſe God put a reſtraint upon him. <hi>Touch all that he hath,</hi> ſaith Satan; that referred to his poſſeſſions &amp; outward eſtate, as if that had bin the mind of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in the motion, do but afflict him in his outward eſtate, I deſire no more to make this tryal: now when the Lord ſaith, <hi>All that he hath is in thy hand,</hi> there he grants him the motion in the letter of it: but the

Lord God ſaw that Satan had a further reach, when he ſaid, <hi>Touch all that he hath,</hi> which words ſeeme to extend no further then his eſtate, but had not God limited and reſtrain'd him, he by an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite grant to his motion had likewiſe fallen upon his perſon, that was the great morſell he gaped after all this while, he would have been doing with <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe, elſe there was no need of this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Onely upon himſelfe put not forth thy hand</hi>; Satans fingers itcht to be medling with <hi>Job,</hi> though his words called for what he had, not for himſelfe.</p>
               <q>And Satan went forth from the preſence of the Lord.</q>
               <p>As ſoone as he hath leave and his Commiſſion, he is gone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, <hi>He went out from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> The word is, he went out from the face of the Lord: Now the face of the Lord in Scripture it is taken ſometimes for the eſſentiall glory of God, that inacceſſible Majeſty of God, Exod. 33. ult. <hi>Thou canſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my face.</hi> Sometimes the face of God is put for the favour and love of God, <hi>Cauſe thy face to ſhine upon thy Sanctuary which is deſolate,</hi> Dan. 9.17. <hi>and cauſe thy face to ſhine upon thy ſervant</hi>: So in many other places the face of God is put for the favour of God, becauſe as the favour and love of a man is ſeene and diſcovered in his face, ſo there is ſomewhat in thoſe dealings of God which diſcover God, he is ſaid to make his face to ſhine upon his people, when he doth diſcover by any act of his, that he loves and favours them; that is the ſhining of his face upon them: The face interprets the heart and ſhewes the meaning of the ſpirit: ſo in thoſe things which interpret ſomewhat of the love of God to us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Index animi vultus.</hi>
                  </note> God is ſaid to make his face ſhine upon us. On the other ſide the face of God is put ſometimes for the anger and wrath of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe anger is ſeene in the face too, ſo in thoſe things by which God diſcovereth his anger, he is ſaid to ſet his face againſt men; there is an expreſſe place for it in this ſenſe, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.16. <hi>The anger of the Lord</hi> (the Hebrew is, <hi>the face of the Lord) hath divided them</hi>; that is, the Lord hath done ſuch things as have the character of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon them, that doe repreſent and hold forth nothing but the anger of the Lord unto a people, and that anger of the Lord is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the face of the Lord unto a people. Thirdly by the face of the Lord in Scripture, we may underſtand the ordinances and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, becauſe in them and by them God is revealed, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted and knowne to his people, as a man is knowne by his face:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98733:77"/>
So in the old Teſtament, comming to God in thoſe inſtitutions was called <hi>appearing before God,</hi> becauſe in them God had promiſed to manifeſt himſelfe unto his people. Laſtly, the face of God is put for the common and generall preſence of God in the world, by which he filleth Heaven and Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>Whether ſhall I go from thy preſence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when it is ſaid that <hi>Satan went forth from the face of God,</hi> or <hi>from the preſence of God,</hi> it cannot be underſtood in the firſt or in the ſecond ſenſe, for he cannot ſo come into the preſence of God or before the face of God: before his face of glory, or before his face of favour Satan never came nor ever ſhall. And as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is taken for his worſhip; ſo Satan cares not to come into his preſence. Laſtly, as the face of God ſignifies his common and generall preſence in the world, ſo Satan cannot poſſibly goe out from his face, <hi>Whether ſhall I goe from thy preſence?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 139.</note> nor men, nor devils are able to go out of the preſence of the Lord in that ſence, for he filleth Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>Then theſe words, <hi>He went out from the preſence of the Lord</hi> are ſpoken after the manner of men.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hominum more loquitur, a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſervi exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, ut manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta exequantur quae ab illis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceperunt.</hi>
                  </note> When a ſervant commeth to his Maſter to receive Commiſſion to doe ſome buſineſſe and hath his errand given him, then he goeth out from the preſence of his Maſter about his buſineſſe. So Satan comes here upon a buſineſſe unto God, he makes a motion, and deſireth to have ſuch power put into his hand, to doe ſuch and ſuch things: the Lord grants it, and ſo ſoone as ever he had his diſpatch, he goeth out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord. So that the meaning is only this, that Satan left off ſpeaking with God, left off moving God any further at that time, and went out to execute that which he got commiſſion to doe, as ſervants goe out from the preſence of their Maſters, when they have received warrant or direction what to doe. While a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is in expectation of his meſſage or errand, ſo long his eyes are upon his Maſter, <hi>Our eyes wait upon thee O God, as the eyes of ſervants looke unto the hands of their Maſters,</hi> Pſal. 123.3. The eyes of ſervants wait upon the face of the Maſter till they have received their meſſage, and then they goe out from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>It notes the ſpeed that Satan makes when he receives power from God to afflict or to chaſten and try any of his children, he makes no ſtay, preſently he goeth out from the preſence of the Lord. Satan is ſpeedy and active in executing any power that is
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98733:78"/>
committed unto him againſt the people of God, againſt any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member, or againſt the Church in generall: As ſoone as ever he hath but his Commiſſion to afflict he is gone about it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly: As the good Angels in Heaven are deſcribed to have wings, becauſe as ſoone as ever they have received a command from God, they are upon the wing, they fly as it were to fulfill the will of God; and in that ſenſe goe out of his preſence: So Satan and the wicked Angels are upon the wing too in that ſenſe, as ſoon as ever they have received power, they preſently put it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>And we may in this make Satan himſelfe our patterne. As we pray that the will of God may be done on earth as it is in heaven, in heaven by the good Angels: So in this ſenſe (I ſay) we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that we may doe the will of God with as much ſpeed as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Angels. It is not unwarrantable to learne from Satan ſpeedily to be doing about the will of God.</p>

From this 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe to the end of the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. the afflictions of <hi>Job</hi> are particularly deſcribed; and we may obſerve 6 particulars in the Context concerning his afflictions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The time or ſeaſon of his afflictions, <hi>And there was a day when his ſonnes and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt brothers houſe,</hi> ver. 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The inſtruments or the meanes of his afflictions. Satan who undertooke the afflicting of <hi>Job,</hi> ſtands as it were behind the doore, he doth not appeare in it, but ſets on others. His inſtruments were firſt cruell and bloody minded men, the <hi>Sabeans</hi> verſe 15. The
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98733:78"/>
                  <hi>Chaldeans</hi> verſe 17. Secondly, thoſe active creatures, devouring fire and ſtormy windes, the <hi>fire,</hi> verſe 16. the <hi>winde,</hi> verſe 19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The matter of his affliction, or in what he was afflicted, it was in his outward eſtate.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The variety of his afflictions, he was not ſmitten in ſome one thing, in ſome one part of his outward eſtate, but he was afflicted in all, his Oxen, his Aſſes and his Camels violently taken away, his Sheep burnt up by the fire; his ſons and his daughters over-whelmed and cruſhed by the fall of an houſe, all his ſervants attending upon theſe ſlaine, conſumed, deſtroyed, excepting only one from every ſtroke, to be the ſad relator or meſſenger of theſe calamities.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſuddenneſſe of his afflictions, they came all upon him in one day.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The unceſſantneſſe of the report of theſe afflictions, the ſound of them all was in his eares at once: as they were all brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in one day, ſo they are all told him in one houre, yea by the ſtory it doth appeare, there were but very few moments betweene the firſt and the laſt. For the Text ſaith that no ſooner had one meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger ended his dolefull news, but another begins, nay they did not ſtay ſo long as to let one another make an end; but the Text ſaith, <hi>While the former was yet ſpeaking, there came another and ſaid,</hi> and ſo while the next was yet ſpeaking, there came another and ſaid, <hi>&amp; while he was yet speaking, another,</hi> &amp;c. So that Satan did not give <hi>Job</hi> ſo much as the leaſt minute of intermiſſion to breath a while or recollect himſelfe. His troubles both in the acting and in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, were cloſe linked together, like a chaine one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he within them all <hi>faſt bound, and yet free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are obſervable, thorough the whole Context concerning this great affliction of <hi>Job.</hi> Now we will conſider the afflictions themſelves, their ſeverall parts, and open the words in which they are preſented to us.</p>

                  </note> and there is an expreſſe addition in the Originall, which puts an <hi>emphaſis</hi> upon it, and makes it more then a day, there was <hi>that day,</hi> or <hi>that speciall day</hi>: So it is uſed, 2 Kin. 4.8. <hi>And it fell on a day that</hi> Eliſha <hi>paſſed to Shunem,</hi> or upon that day, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table day wherein ſo many great things were done.</p>
               <p>But what day was this? It is explained in the words, in the latter part of the verſe. It was a notable day, for it was a day or that day, <hi>When his ſonnes and his daughters were eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wine in their eldeſt brothers houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three things in thoſe words, which prove that this was an extraordinary day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was a feaſting day, and feaſting dayes are extraordinary dayes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was an extraordinary, not an ordinary feaſting day; For it is ſaid, <hi>they were eating and drinking wine.</hi> In the beginning of the Chapter (where the feaſts of <hi>Jobs</hi> children are deſcribed) it is ſaid only, <hi>That his ſonnes went every one their day, to eat and to drinke:</hi> But here it is ſaid, that they did <hi>eat and drinke wine</hi>: which notes an extraordinary feaſt. For ſtill in Scripture, when we reade of a banquet of wine, or of a feaſt of wine, an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary feaſt is meant:<note place="margin">Eſth. 5.6.</note> Queene <hi>Esther</hi> invited the King and <hi>Haman to a banquet of wine,</hi> not that there was nothing but wine at the banquet, but that addition doth imply, that it was a plentifull banquet, a ſolemne banquet. It is more to make a <hi>banquet of wine,</hi> then to make a <hi>banquet,</hi> though ſcarce any banquet is made without wine.<note place="margin">Joh. 2.4.</note> So when there wanted wine, the ſolemnity and glory of the feaſt was thought to be blemiſhed, <hi>They have no wine,</hi> ſaith the mother of Chriſt unto him at the marriage feaſt in <hi>Cana.</hi> And when the Spouſe would ſet forth the wonderfull fullneſſe of ſpirituall delights, which ſhe had from Chriſt, ſhe expreſſeth it thus,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>He brought me into the banqueting houſe,</hi> the Hebrew word is, <hi>he brought me into the houſe of wine</hi>; the houſe of wine notes extraordinary ſpirituall refreſhing. What a banquet had the Spouſe for her ſoule there? Chriſt called her to eat and drinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly, to be filled with his love. See the like <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.6. So <hi>Jobs</hi> children were eating and drinking wine, <hi>ſc.</hi> they were at a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and ſolemne feaſt that day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was a day of feaſting in their <hi>eldeſt brothers houſe,</hi> that is another thing which prooves it was an extraordinary feaſt day.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98733:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It was a feaſt, and a feaſt of wine, and a feaſt of wine in their eldeſt brothers houſe, who had a larger eſtate, a fuller portion, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the dignity of his primogenitor, ought to make a more ſolemne feaſt then the reſt did: This was the day that Satan pickes out and chooſes to bring all theſe ſad afflictions upon <hi>Job,</hi> an ordinary day would not ſerve his turne; without doubt this was not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate day or time, after which he got that Commiſſion from God, <hi>All that he hath is in thine hand</hi>; Satan went away, he would have been at it as ſoone as he could, but yet he waiteth for a ſpeciall time, wherin he might do it with greateſt advantage; and that is the point I ſhall obſerve from this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Satan obſerveth and watcheth his time to faſten his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations moſt ſtrongly upon the ſoule.</hi> He watcheth a day, <hi>there was a day,</hi> and there was not a day in the whole yeare, upon which he could have done it with greater advantage then upon that day. As the mercies of God are exceedingly endeared to us by the ſeaſon in which they come to us: When they come to us in our ſpeciall need; how ſweet is a mercy then! And as our obedience is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly commended to the acceptation of God, when it is upon a fit day, when it is on the day, wherein he calls for and expects it: And as our ſinnes are exceedingly aggravated, by the ſeaſon and time wherein they are committed: What, ſinne upon this day? A day of trouble, a day of humiliation? As <hi>Eliſha</hi> rebuked <hi>Gehazi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kin. 5.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Is this a time to receive money, and to receive garments?</hi> &amp;c. Is this a time for thy heart to runne out ſinfully after the world? So likewiſe the temptations of Satan and the afflictions which hee brings upon the ſervants of God, are exceedingly imbittered by the ſeaſon, and he knowes well enough, what ſeaſons will make them moſt bitter; And what can more imbitter a cup of ſorrow, then to have it brought us upon a day of rejoycing. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>as he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vineger upon nitre, ſo is he that ſings a ſong to an heavy heart</hi>; If joy be troubleſome in our ſorrowes, how troubleſome is ſorrow in the midſt of our joyes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.20. Then, Satan could never have found out ſuch a time as this; Muſt he needs be afflicting the Father, when the children were a feaſting? Could he find out no other time but this? Muſt his teares be mingled with their wine? Muſt the childrens rejoycing day be the Fathers mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning day? Muſt Satan needs ſhew his malice againſt the Father, when the children were ſhewing their love one to another? It was
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98733:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a love-feaſt.<note place="margin">Mat. 4.2.</note> Thus he did with Chriſt; it is obſerved that when Chriſt had faſted 40. dayes and 40. nights, and afterwards was an hungry, then the Tempter came, he layes hold of this advantage, he would not come till he was hungry, to perſwade him to turne ſtones into bread. What a ſtrength had this temptation from the ſeaſon? Who would not make bread for himſelfe if he can, when hee is hungry? Had Chriſt been full, there had not been ſuch an edge upon, ſuch a weight in the temptation. How many doth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan provoke to turne ſtones into bread, when he commes to them in their hunger? Thou art in a ſtrait, like to ſtarve and periſh, turne ſtones into bread, that is, procure thy ſelfe meat and proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by unlawfull and ſinfull wayes; This is indeed to turne ſtones into bread. So here at this time when <hi>Job</hi> was rejoycing (as doubtleſſe he did) to ſee the love and unity of his children; now at this time Satan attempts to turne their bread into a ſtone, to bruiſe and breake the heart of their tender Father. <hi>Afflictions preſſe moſt when they are leaſt expected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us obſerve then this mixture of malice and cunning in Satan, in chooſing his time. To carry a man from one extremity to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, puts him upon the greateſt extremity: To make the day of a mans greateſt rejoycing to be the day of his deepeſt ſorrowes, this is cutting, if not killing ſorrow. To be brought from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſorrow to extreame joy ſuddenly, doth rather amaze then comfort the ſpirit of a man: It is ſaid that <hi>when the Lord turned againe the captivity of</hi> Zion, <hi>the people were like them that dreame,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 126.1.</note> the change was ſo great, ſo ſudden, that they were rather aſtoniſhed and amazed then comforted with it, for a while. So, much more to be hurried from extreame joy to extreame ſorrow, from the borders of comfort to the brinke of death on a ſudden, is not ſo much to afflict a man as to confound and diſtract him. This courſe Satan takes with <hi>Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were well if we could be wiſe in this reſpect to imitate Satan, to chooſe out our day to do good when there is greateſt probability of ſucceſſe, as he choſe out his day to do miſchief! It is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles rule,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note> 
                  <hi>as you have opportunity doe good</hi>; if wee could be wiſe to lay hold upon opportunities, it would be a wonderfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to us; <hi>as a word fitly spoken is word upon the wheele,</hi> ſo a worke fitly done, is a worke upon the wheele, it goeth on, takes upon the heart both of God and man. Let us conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now we have not a ſeaſon, whether this be not a day that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98733:80"/>
holds forth to us a glorious opportunity. Surely we may preſent this day unto you, as a day to be doing in. Let us therefore be as quick in this our day to doe good, as Satan was in that day to doe hurt. This is a day wherein great things are a doing, and grievous things are a ſuffering by many of our bretheren, therefore you ſhould be working this day, make a day on't. This is a day in which ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> men that will not beare Chriſts yoke, are combining to breake it, and to caſt his coards from them. Then joyne, this day to helpe Chriſt; elſe, as <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eſther,</hi>

                  <hi>If thou altogether holdeſt thy peace at this time</hi> (this was a day for <hi>Eſther</hi> to worke in) <hi>then ſhall there enlargement and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance ariſe to the</hi> Jewes <hi>from another place, but thou and thy fathers houſe ſhall be destroyed:</hi> So I may ſay to you in reference to the preſent opportunity, if you altogether hold your peace, hold your purſes, and hold your hands at this time, at ſuch a day as this, enlargement will come to the Church ſome other way, but you may be deſtroyed, who thinke to hold and keepe your peace either by ſaying or doing nothing: If ever you will appeare, this is a day to appeare in to doe good. Let us be wiſe to manage and improve our day; That it may never be ſaid of us as our Lord Chriſt did of <hi>Jeruſalem: If yee had knowne, even ye, in this your day, the things which belong unto your peace,</hi> Luk. 19.42. It is a ſadder thing to have had a ſeaſon and not to know it, (<hi>ſc.</hi> not to uſe it,) then not to have had it. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.6. That, <hi>Becauſe to every purpoſe there is a time and judgement, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the miſery of man is great upon him.</hi> Miſery cannot be great to a man, becauſe there is a time for every purpoſe, but becauſe men are either ſo blind that they cannot ſee, or ſo ſluggiſh that they will not make uſe of the proper time for every purpoſe. Thus the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher himſelfe expounds it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.12. <hi>For man alſo knoweth not his time, as the fiſhes that are taken in an evill not, and as the birds are taken in a ſnare, ſo are the ſonnes of men ſnared in an evill time, when it falleth ſuddenly upon them.</hi> Conſider what <hi>Solomons</hi> experience taught him: Let not your inadvertency of theſe times, make you a new experiment of that ancient truth, And leave men that ſhould be wiſe, eſpecially that pretend to wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to be numbred among, and compared with a ſilly bird, a ſilent fiſh.</p>
               <p>Then again, Foraſmuch as it was the day of their great feaſt, of their feaſt with wine, upon which this great affliction aſſaulted <hi>Job,</hi> Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:98733:81"/>
                  <hi>That the faireſt and cleareſt day of our outward comfort may be clouded and overcaſt before the evening.</hi> It was as faire a day as ever began in <hi>Jobs</hi> family, a feaſt, and a feaſt with wine, and that in the eldeſt Brothers houſe, and yet all was darkeneſſe before night.</p>
               <p>This is true in reference to ungodly men, great and terrible judgements fall ſuddainly upon them; their light is turned into darkneſſe in a moment, as Chriſt compares it to the dayes of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and the dayes of <hi>Lot; As it was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the dayes of</hi> Noah, <hi>they did eate, they dranke, they married wives, they were given in marriage untill the day that</hi> Noah <hi>entred into the Arke, and the flood came and deſtroyed them all; and as it was in the dayes of</hi> Lot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> both which are in two words ſet out by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.3.</note> 
                  <hi>when they ſhall ſay, peace and ſafety, then ſudden destruction commeth.</hi> Thus it is with ungodly men, their Sunne often ſets at noone, when they ſay, yea when they conclude all's well, then judgement mixt with wrath is at the doore. This is a truth alſo in reference unto godly men and the Churches of God, all their outward comforts may be clouded in a day, while they are eating and drinking, not ſinfully but in a holy manner: ſuppoſe as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle adviſeth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31.</note> 
                  <hi>to the glory of God,</hi> yet even at that time all may preſently be taken away. And therefore as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce as if you rejoyced not</hi> in the creature,<note place="margin">1 Cor 7.30.</note> and eate as if you did not eate, and buy as if you poſſeſſed not, Why? For the faſhion of this world, the Scheme of this world paſſeth away. You ſee it did with <hi>Job</hi>; in what a goodly faſhion was his worldly eſtate in the morning, how was it dreſt and adorned in perfect beauty in all its excellencies (as we heard it before deſcribed,) yet before night all the faſhion of it paſt away, and the beauty of it was quite blaſted: Therefore you that have great eſtates, and good eſtates, eſtates well gotten, and well govern'd, be not high-minded, truſt not in uncertaine riches;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17. Pſal. 62.10.</note> If riches increaſe, and if they increaſe in a right way, <hi>yet ſet not your hearts upon them,</hi> for the faſhion of worldly things quickly paſſeth away; Riches make themſelves wings to fly away, when thou art making doores and locks, bolts and barres to keepe them in. That for the time in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe.</p>
               <p>But what did Satan upon this day?</p>
               <p>That is ſet forth in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>v.</hi> and ſo on. <hi>And there came a meſſenger unto</hi> Job <hi>and ſaid, The Oxen were plowing, and the Aſſes feeding beſide them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:98733:81"/>
                  <hi>There came a meſſenger.</hi>] The Jewiſh Rabbins and ſome of the Fathers, tell us that theſe meſſengers were Devils, evill ſpirits in the likeneſſe of men. But ſurely the opinion hath little likeneſſe with the truth, therefore with <hi>Beza,</hi> I lay it by and reject it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the tales of the Rabbins. Theſe meſſengers were really the eſcaped ſervants of <hi>Job,</hi> as we ſhall ſee afterward.</p>
               <p>Now the meſſenger beſpeakes <hi>Job</hi> thus, <hi>The Oxen were plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> they were hard at their worke, <hi>and the Aſſes were feeding beſides them.</hi> The word in the Hebrew is this, <hi>the Aſſes were feeding at their hand,</hi> or at hand; to be at hand, doth note neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; in our language we ſay, ſuch a thing is at hand, or ſuch a man is at hand, the day of our feare is at hand, when we meane they are neare; <hi>The Lord is at hand,</hi> Phil. 4.5. <hi>ſc.</hi> nigh unto us for our helpe. So 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.2. It is applied alſo to neereneſſe of place as well as of time, <hi>Neh.</hi> 3.2. where the building of the wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is deſcribed, it is ſaid, <hi>Next unto him built the men of Jericho,</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>at the hand of him built the men of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo, <hi>that is next to him in place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the meſſenger deſcribeth all in ſuch a poſture, <hi>The Oxen were plowing, and the Aſſes feeding:</hi> by this to aſſure <hi>Job</hi> of the care and diligence of his ſervants about his buſineſſe, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Cattell, and improving of his ground: as if he ſhould have ſaid, This ſad affliction which is come upon thee, did not come through our negligence or improvidence, we were about our buſineſſe according to our ſeverall places, <hi>The Oxen were plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Aſſes were feeding by them,</hi> they were not careleſly left to danger, but our eye was upon them, yet notwithſtanding they were all ſurprized and taken away.</p>
               <p>From this relation of the poſture of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſervants and Cattell at the time when this affliction fell upon them, we may obſerve thus much;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all our care and diligence cannot ſecure outward thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</hi> Afflictions may take us in the middeſt of our beſt and moſt honeſt endeavours. A man may be looking to and ordering his eſtate, and yet at the very time, while his eye is upon it, he may ſee it take its flight like an Eagle towards Heaven; while he is ordering of it, he may ſee diſorder and confuſion comming upon it: while he is ſetling of it by honeſt care, he may quickly ſee it unſetled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and all broken to peeces, as it was here with <hi>Job</hi>; he was in a very good way, his ſervants were honeſtly employed, but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98733:82"/>
all is gone; The Oxen were taken away, and the Aſſes that fed by them. But who made this attempt? The meſſenger informes that in the next words;
<q>And the <hi>Sabeans</hi> fell upon them.</q>

               <p>As when the Widdow of <hi>Tekoah</hi> had told a faire tale to <hi>David</hi> about the bringing backe of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> the King asked her, <hi>Is not the hand of</hi> Joab <hi>with thee in all this?</hi>

                  <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and by ſtrong temptations provoked them to doe this ſervice.</p>
               <p>But how could he prevaile upon the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> that they ſhould come and doe his buſineſſe now at this time?</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle telleth us,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> 
                  <hi>that wicked men are led captive by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan at his will.</hi> Satan doth lead men captive at his will, while they are as they conceive conquerours, riding in triumph, doing their owne will. Theſe <hi>Sabeans</hi> came to execute their own deſignes, but Satan had a deſigne upon them, he brought them thus to ſpoile the eſtate of <hi>Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what could Satan doe? How could Satan prevaile with theſe? Can he force men to be his inſtruments, to execute his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes upon the people of God? Or hath he <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> Nations and people at his beck, or under his command?</p>
               <p>No, Satan cannot force or compell them againſt their wills, but as that Scripture ſaith, <hi>he leads them captive at his will</hi>; and as another Scripture, <hi>he is a Prince of the power of the ayre,</hi> and he <hi>workes in the children of diſobedience,</hi> yea <hi>hee workes like a Prince, mightily and powerfully in the children of diſobedience</hi>;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.</note> Though he cannot conſtraine them, yet he can worke mightily in them to effect what he hath to doe.</p>
               <p>But how doth he bring them about thus readily and ſuddenly to act what he projects,</p>
               <p>Thus; Firſt, He finds out the temper and diſpoſition of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; That Satan can doe; he is a great <hi>Naturaliſt,</hi> and hath a great deale of helpe to his skill, <hi>long experience,</hi> by both he can goe very farre in diſcovering the diſpoſitions of men, which way their ſpirits tend; and he found out that theſe <hi>Sabeans</hi> were a people given to robbery and ſpoile, and ſo fit miniſters for him to worke by in his deſigne of ſpoiling the eſtate of <hi>Job.</hi> Secondly, When he hath found out the naturall temper or ſtate of a mans heart, he can lay a baite of temptation ſutable to that inclination and deſire: finding out a people given to ſpoile, he preſently ſets before them rich ſpoiles, theſe are a taking object. See, yonder is a brave prize for you, yonder is a rich man, his eſtate will be good plunder, yonder are Oxen and Aſſes ſtore, there's good booty to be had. Thus finding out their diſpoſition, he preſents or holds up an object to them which hits it fully. Thirdly, Satan deales with man to draw him to his purpoſe a degree further, <hi>ſc.</hi> by injecting and caſting into the mind the motion to doe this:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98733:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He not only preſents ſuch and ſuch a thing, ſuch and ſuch an opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, but he caſts in and injects the motion. As it is ſaid of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 13.2.</note> that the Devill <hi>put it into his heart to betray Chriſt</hi>; The Devill being a ſpirit hath acceſſe to our ſpirits, and can convey himſelfe into them and inſtill his ſuggeſtions: as the Lord Chriſt did breath upon his Diſciples, and ſo they received the Holy Ghoſt, and were filled with the Spirit; So Satan breaths filthy ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions into the ſpirits of men, and fills them with all manner of wickedneſſe, malice, unrighteouſneſſe, he fills them with the ſpirit of Hell: <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 5.3.</note> Satan had fill'd his heart <hi>to lye to the Holy Ghost</hi>; Thus he inſtilled theſe thoughts of gaine by robbery and murder into the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Caldeans,</hi> and filled their hearts brim full: Then they reſolve to act it with the hand, and ſo they become his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Laſtly, Satan can doe ſomewhat more then inject and ſuggeſt ſuch thoughts; he can mightily irritate and provoke, and ſtirre up the heart to be willing to give entertainement to ſuch a motion. He not onely barely preſents his temptation, but vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently backs it, and will give no reſt to a man till he yeelds it: As it is ſaid of his tempting <hi>David, that Satan ſtood up and provoked</hi> David <hi>to number the people:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 21.1.</note> He did not only inject ſuch a thought into <hi>David,</hi> but he <hi>provoked him,</hi> he never let him alone, but followed him and ſolicited him to it. This Satan can doe; And yet he cannot <hi>preſſe men</hi> to take up Armes for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, all thoſe that fight under Satans colours are <hi>Voluntiers,</hi> he never conſtraines any, neither can he, the will is never forced by him, neither can it be. Satan uſes no compulſion beyond a morall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion well ſet on, he can but vexe us (as the <hi>Midianites</hi> did <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.)</hi> with his wiles. He is an <hi>Achitophel,</hi> not an <hi>Alexander,</hi> a <hi>Matchiavil,</hi> not a <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the manner of Satans working in the children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. All theſe things he can doe; yet I beleeve he is not alwayes put to doe all theſe upon every one over whom he prevailes; Some come to this worke on eaſier tearmes then others. He needs not provoke and ſolicit them, a ſuggeſtion winnes them. The very ſight of an object overcomes them: Yea ſome ſtand ready offering their ſervice unto Satan, and ſelling themſelves to work any wickedneſſe he will employ them in. I have ſhewed you the moſt that Satan can doe; I conceive he had not much to doe with theſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans</hi> to invite them to this warre: <hi>That which is in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98733:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is eaſily moved.</hi> And as we ſay, <hi>He must needs runne whom the Devill drives,</hi> ſo the Devill needs not drive them who are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of themſelves.</p>
               <p>It being opened, what theſe <hi>Sabeans</hi> were, and how they came into the ſervice of Satan, what made them take up Armes, as it were, in his cauſe; we may obſerve from hence,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That wicked and ungodly men while they ſatisfie their owne luſts, are but doing the worke of Satan and executing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.</hi> Theſe <hi>Sabeans,</hi> though they did not thinke it, yet they came upon Satans errand: So God, when he doth juſtly uſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men to puniſh or correct his people, they doe their owne will, and they have their owne way; but God hath his way too, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules them to effect his buſineſſe at that time; As it is ſaid of the King of <hi>Aſſyria, O</hi> Aſſyrian, <hi>the rod of mine anger, I will ſend him againſt an hypocriticall Nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him charge; How be it, he meaneth not ſo, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth his heart thinke ſo,</hi> Iſa. 10. he hath purpoſes of his own. So they that are agitated by Satan and provoked by him, <hi>they think not ſo,</hi> they thinke not they are doing the will and worke, the dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty drugery of Satan, but the truth is, they doe nothing elſe all the while: <hi>You are of your father the Devill, and his lusts you will doe, ſaith Christ to the</hi> Jewes, while they doe their owne,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.</note> they fulfill the luſts and deſignes of Satan. As it is ſaid in the <hi>Revelation, The Devill ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon</hi>; it was not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in perſon, it was the Devill in his ſeconds or ſervants;<note place="margin">Revel. 2.10.</note> and theſe men little thought that they did the Devills ſervice at that time, if one ſhould have come and told them, you are now doing the Devills worke, and undertaking a peece of ſervice for him, you are as ſo many inſtruments and agents for Hell; they would not have beleeved it, but the truth is, it was the Devills worke, and they did it ſo develliſhly, that from both it is ſaid the Devill did it, he caſt ſome of them into priſon. It is a fearfull thing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute or oppreſſe the people of God, ſuch in ſerving their owne luſts, are indeed the <hi>right hand of Satan, the Devills hirelings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Foraſmuch as Satan will have <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> to afflict <hi>Jobs</hi> eſtate, (he could have deſtroyed all himſelfe if he pleaſed. Good Angels have mighty power, and ſo have wicked Angels too, if God will let them alone to put out their power, therefore they are called <hi>Principalities and powers.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> Satan had leave, he might have taken what courſe he would with the eſtate
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98733:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Iob</hi>: he doth not call in the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and the <hi>Caldeans</hi> to this worke, becauſe he could not doe it himſelfe; No, it is becauſe he would worke by others, he would have inſtruments.) Note from hence;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Satan loveth to draw others to be partakers with him in his deſignes.</hi> Though he can doe his worke alone, yet he will have man joyne with him in it if he can: And in this he imitates God himſelfe, who hath an almighty power, is able to doe all things alone if he pleaſe, yet he uſually calleth in inſtruments: He is able to convert alone by the motion of his Spirit, but he will have Preachers to convert by the miniſtery of the Word: He is able to protect his people from their enemies by his own ſtrength, yet he will have Armies muſtered to doe it by. And why doth God chuſe to worke thus? There is a double good in it. He doth it that he may doe good two wayes at once. Firſt, His creature is ſaved and relieved, that's one good. Secondly, Men who are employed as inſtruments are honoured and reſpected; They having given helpe to God in ſuch a cauſe, (ſo he interprets it, a <hi>comming forth to helpe the Lord againſt the mighty</hi>) God gives them honour in the eyes of all his ſervants, There is another good. So Satan, while he ſetteth men a worke, <hi>Sabeans, Caldeans</hi> and others to doe miſchiefe, he doth a double miſchiefe at once; he doth miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to <hi>Job</hi> or others whom he afflicts, and he doth miſchiefe to his inſtruments, he makes theſe ſin as he makes others ſuffer: If he carry on the worke alone, they ſuffer, but others doe not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the guilt of the ſin; but now when he uſeth inſtruments to effect his wicked deſignes, he makes one miſerable and the other wicked. This is one of Satans methods, he will worke by meanes, and do his buſineſſe by the hands of men, that he may at once doe a double miſchiefe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In that theſe <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Caldeans</hi> are obſerved in Hiſtories to be a people given much to robberies and ſpoile, and theſe are the men whom Satan picks out for this buſineſſe. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Satan ſuiteth his temptations to mans naturall temper and inclination.</hi> Whenſoever he tempteth, he takes this advantage if he can diſcover or obtaine it. He is wiſer then to ſet ſaile againſt wind and tyde, to row againſt the ſtreame; Therefore he labours all he can, to find which way the ſtreame of every mans affections runs; and to what ſins his relations, his calling or his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,

lay him moſt open and obnoxious, accordingly hee layes his ſnares and ſpreads his net. When he meets with a proud man, him he tempteth with high thoughts: When he meeteth with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man, him he tempteth to the love of the world, he layes a golden bait of profit before his eyes: The adulterous he leades to the Harlots houſe. For howſoever it be true, that every man hath in him a principle ſuiting to every ſinne, yet it is a truth too, that every man is not equally active for or diſpos'd unto every ſin, and every man hath not every particular ſinne predominant in him; now Satan when he ſeeth what is predominant in any man, then he faſhioneth and frameth a temptation ſutable: He perceived theſe <hi>Sabeans</hi> were given to rob and ſpoyle, and he ſheweth them a deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable booty.</p>
               <q>And have ſlain thy ſervants with the edge of the ſword.</q>
               <p>This is a further aggravation of the affliction, they did not onely fall upon <hi>Jobs</hi> cattell and tooke them away; but they ſlew his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. A mans ſervants are nearer to him then his Cattell, then his Oxen and his Aſſes; ſervants are next unto our Children. So that this was an heightning of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſorrow, not onely are your cattell gone, but your ſervants are ſlaine, and they are <hi>ſlaine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the edge of the ſword</hi>; the word in the Hebrew is, <hi>they are ſlain with the mouth of the ſword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reade in Scripture ſometimes of the <hi>face of the Sword,</hi> and ſometime of the <hi>mouth of the Sword.</hi> As <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.8. where wee tranſlate, <hi>they ſhall flee from the Sword,</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>they ſhall flee from the face of the Sword</hi>; The like Text you have, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.27. Now when the Scripture ſpeakes of the <hi>face of the Sword,</hi> it is meant of warre comming, or warre preparing and approaching. But the <hi>mouth of the Sword</hi> is warre inflicted, warre acted. This phraſe, the mouth of the Sword is uſed to ſhew that the Sword is a great devourer, Deut. 32.42. <hi>I will make mine arrowes drunke with bloud, and my Sword ſhall devoure fleſh.</hi> Warre hath a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible face, it hath a wide mouth and ſharpe teeth, <hi>They have ſlain thy ſervants with the edge of the Sword,</hi> the mouth of the Sword hath devoured them.</p>
               <p>At this day we have great cauſe to have our hearts deepely affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with this thing. There hath been (as it were) the face of the Sword a great while looking towards us, but now there is the very mouth of the Sword gaping at us, yea tearing, gnawing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring

the fleſh and bones of thouſands amongſt us. Where the Sword comes it will devoure; warre is a great judgement, one of Gods ſore judgements, the ſoreſt of all Gods outward judgements. <hi>David</hi> chooſeth the peſtilence rather then the Sword, the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is a devourer, but the Sword is a greater devourer. And though the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in his <hi>Lamentations</hi> makes famine a ſorer judgement then the Sword (<hi>Cap.</hi> 4.9.) <hi>They that be ſlaine with the Sword are better then they that be ſlaine with hunger.</hi> Yet the Sword is in this worſe then famine, becauſe uſually it is the cauſe of famine. The Sword cuts off food, the ſupport of mans life, as well as the life of man. While the Sword is making it ſelf fat, it hath famine in the belly of it.</p>
               <p>We need not goe to <hi>Jeremy</hi> or <hi>Joſephus</hi> for the proofe of this, in <hi>Jeruſalems Babylonian</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> deſolations, ſad <hi>Germany,</hi> bleeding <hi>Ireland</hi> are neare woefull witneſſes and ſpectacles of it at this day. The Sword hath open'd a way for famine to enter both, and which of the two hath eaten moſt fleſh, is hard to determine. Let us cry earneſtly to God that the mouth of the Sword may be ſtopped, or continued open only to devoure thoſe who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure the man that is more righteous then they; Let us pray that bloud may be ſpared, or none but corrupt bloud ſpilt. <hi>Spare thy people O Lord</hi>; It is (I confeſſe) one of the ſaddeſt prognoſticks in my obſervation againſt this Nation: That God hitherto hath made little difference. Our Sword hath not yet been taught from Heaven to diſtinguiſh of men. Precious bloud hath been drawne; and men whoſe very haires were all numbred (that is highly priz'd) by God, have been numbred among the ſlaine. It muſt ſatisfie us that the will of God is ſo. The anſwer which <hi>David</hi> gave <hi>Joabs</hi> meſſenger is good ſetling councell now (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.25.) <hi>Let not this thing displeaſe thee</hi> (He ſpeakes this after the fall of noble <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijah) for the ſword</hi> (not by accident but decree, not caſually but providentially) <hi>devoureth ſo and ſuch</hi> (as the Hebrew ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance hath it) <hi>one as well as another,</hi> ſo we tranſlate. It is mercy we are not all conſumed by this eater, as in the Text yee may reade all the ſervants of <hi>Job</hi> were, excepting one, only one got out of the mouth of the ſword, it eat up all ſaving one, and hee was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that by the report of this deſtructive ſword he might deſtroy <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe.</p>

The ſword was very hungry, when but one man of all <hi>Jobs</hi> ſervants eſcaped the teeth of it.</p>
               <p>But how commeth it to paſſe that this one man eſcaped?</p>
               <p>Certainely, as I ſaid before, the hand of Satan was in this alſo. For howſoever the Lord ordered and diſpoſed all theſe things, yet he let Satan worke in his circle, in his compaſſe to contrive things, as he pleaſed himſelfe the moſt aptly he could imagine, to afflict and trouble <hi>Job,</hi> therefore there is ſomewhat in it, no good will (I beleeve) to <hi>Job,</hi> that this one man had the favour of quarter or the mercy of an eſcape.</p>
               <p>It was not out of any compaſſionate reſpect to <hi>Job</hi> that one of his ſervants comes home alive. It was rather to increaſe the affliction of <hi>Job,</hi> and for the perfecting of his ſorrowes, this man was not ſlaine, that <hi>Job</hi> might be more deeply wounded. There are two reaſons which may be aſſigned why one man eſcaped out of every one of theſe calamities.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the report of this affliction might come ſuddenly to him. A man that eſcapes out of ſuch a danger needs no dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; his feare will adde wings to his feet, he will runne home amaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the certainty of it. Reports fly abroad, they may be falſe, <hi>Fama mendax,</hi> fame is a lyar. <hi>Job</hi> might have had ſuch reports from his neighbours in the country, all your cattell are ſeized upon, and all your ſervants are ſlaine; and <hi>Job</hi> might ſleight it and ſay, this might be but a rumour, I give no credit to it: therfore Satan lets one of his owne ſervants come frighted home with the news, one that was there, one that was an eye-witnes, one that <hi>Job</hi> knew, one that had no reaſon, much leſſe the boldnes to bring falſe tales to him; that ſo the report comming ſpeedily and certainly his heart might be ſmitten preſently. <hi>It is ſome abatement of an evill to have but a colour to doubt of it.</hi> If we can but lay hold of any circumſtance which renders an evill report improbable, and may for a while ſtrengthen our unbeleefe of it, we may in that interim get more ſtrength of faith to beare it, when we ſee it is certaine and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98733:86"/>
unqueſtionable. There was no mercy in ſuch a ſparing.</p>
               <p>And we may obſerve out of it, that which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of the mercies of the wicked is moſt true of Satans, <hi>The very tender mercies of Satan are cruell,</hi> the beſt of his mercies, his ſparings are woundings, he never ſpareth but with an intent to doe further hurt. <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions had not gone ſo deep, if this man had not bin left to bring the meſſage.</p>

               </p>
               <q>The fire of God.</q>
               <p>Why is it here called the <hi>fire of God.</hi> Some conceive it is called the <hi>fire of God,</hi> becauſe ſent from God: that is aſcribed to God, which comes from God, as that <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24. where it is ſaid, <hi>that the Lord did raine fire and brimſtone upon</hi> Sodome <hi>out of Heaven from the Lord,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah</hi> did raine from <hi>Jehovah</hi> fire upon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> to conſume it: And <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.2. it is ſaid, <hi>That a fire went out from the Lord and conſumed</hi> Nadab <hi>and</hi> Abihu. <hi>Elijah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98733:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fire from Heaven to conſume the <hi>Captaines</hi> that came from the <hi>King</hi> to take him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.10, 12. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaking of the plagues of <hi>Aegypt</hi> (Pſal. 105.32.) ſaith <hi>that the Lord ſent flames of fire in the land</hi>; So ſome expound that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104, 3. <hi>He maketh his Angels spirits and his miniſters a flame of fire,</hi> that is, he uſeth flames of fire for his miniſters, for his meſſengers; God ſometimes ſends a fire on his errands, though we know that place is applyed to the Angels by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>But here rather it is called the <hi>fire of God</hi> in another regard; for howſoever this fire was ſent of God, as all afflictions are; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the immediate kindler of it was Satan, he had the power put into his hand; therefore this was not a fire (in that ſence as thoſe other fires are ſaid to be) ſent from God. But it may be called (as uſually in Scripture) <hi>the fire of God,</hi> becauſe of the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fire, it was a wonderfull, an extraordinary fire; and ſo it is very ordinary in the Hebrew to uſe the name of God, <hi>El, Elohim</hi> or <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as an Epithite, as an additionall word to heighten the excellence or rareneſſe of things. Wee find that phraſe often, <hi>A man of God,</hi> the Hebrewes ſay, to call one a man of God, is as much as to ſay, he is an <hi>extraordinary man, a man of an excellent spirit,</hi> a <hi>Prophet, a holy man</hi>: In that Pſalm where the Church is ſhadowed under the ſimilitude of a <hi>Vine,</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>She did ſend forth her branches like the goodly Cedars:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.10.</note> So we tranſlate it, the Originall word is, <hi>She ſent forth her branches as the Cedars of God,</hi> that is, <hi>excellent Cedars, tall</hi> and <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Cedars.</hi> In <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36.6. comparing the love of God to great Mountaines, <hi>Thy loving kindneſſe is as the great mountains,</hi> the word is, <hi>like the mountaines of God:</hi> Pſalme 65.9. <hi>Thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheſt it with the river of God,</hi> that is, <hi>with an excellent River:</hi> Cant. 8.6. ſpeaking of love and of jealouſie, <hi>Love is ſtrong as death, jealouſie is cruell as the grave, the coales thereof are coales of fire, which hath a moſt vehement flame,</hi> the word in the Originall is, a <hi>flame of God, the coales thereof are coales of fire, the flame of God,</hi> that is, as we tranſlate it, <hi>a vehement flame.</hi> So here the <hi>fire of God,</hi> that is, <hi>a ſtrange fire, an unheard of, an unuſuall fire, a vehement fire,</hi> ſuch a fire as had not been ſeen nor obſerved before. Therefore the Hebrewes call extraordinary things the things of God; becauſe indeed all the wonders and excellencies, all the glory and goodneſſe that is in creatures, is but a foot-ſtep, a print or drop of that excellency and glory and power that is in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98733:87"/>
God; therefore every thing that is moſt excellent, is aſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. It is moſt equall that his name ſhould be ſtampt upon all excellent things in the creature, who is the cauſe of all creature excellence. This fire being a ſtrange and extraordinary fire is ſaid to be the fire of God.</p>

                     <hi>Fulgur maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi> Jun.</note>This fire of God is conceived to have been ſome terrible flaſh of lightning, which in a moment deſtroy'd and conſumed the ſheepe and ſhepheards. And this is more probable, becauſe it is ſaid, to fell downe from heaven, that is, out of the aire; for ſo often in Scripture, heaven is put for the aire, the middle region of the aire, where Satan hath great power, therefore he is called, <hi>the Prince of the aire:</hi> and he can doe mighty things, command much in that Magazin of Heaven, where that dreadfull Artillery, which makes men tremble, thoſe fiery Meteors, thunder and lightning are lodged and ſtored up. <hi>Satan let looſe by God can doe wonders in the aire</hi>; He can raiſe ſtormes, he can diſcharge the great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Heaven, thunder and lightning, and by his art hee can make them more terrible and dreadfull then they are in nature. If the skill and art of man can heighten naturall things, then much more the skill of Satan. I doubt not but many fearefull impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are made in the ayre by devils, carrying nature (by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) farre above it's owne courſe, and theſe are properly <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels</hi> or <hi>wonders,</hi> (ſuch as the Magitians wrought in <hi>Egypt</hi> by the helpe of Satan) for miracles are quite out of the devils ſpheare. But he can doe wonders, and ſuch was this fire falling from Heaven, <hi>&amp;c. A marvell or wonder is nature mightily improv'd, a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is nature totally croſs'd, if not contradicted.</hi> Obſerve this for the nature of that fire; the effect of it followes in the next words.</p>
               <q>It hath burnt up the ſheepe and the ſervants, and conſumed them.</q>
               <p>The word in the Originall is, <hi>It did burne them and eat them up.</hi> Fire is a devouring element. Devouring fire, as before a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Sword, theſe were devouring judgements upon <hi>Job.</hi> Yet it doth not neceſſarily inferre that the ſheepe were all burnt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes; but that the ſheepe were all killed by that flame of lightning that came from Heaven; for it is ſaid of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> (of which we ſpake before) that a fire went out from God, and did conſume them, it is the ſame Originall word that is here in the Text, <hi>A fire went out from God, and did eat them up,</hi> yet wee
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98733:87"/>
know their bodies were not conſumed, for they were carried out to their buriall and their garments were upon them. So that this conſuming doth not note the burning of things to aſhes, but a ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them to death; it is a devouring fire, becauſe it is a deſtroying fire, it takes away life: and thus lightnings kill ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by piercing and penetrating than by conſuming and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p>But now here it will be queſtioned for the further opening of this, why Satan chooſes thus to conſume the ſheepe with fire? why doth he not rather uſe ſpoylers to take them away? He could doubtleſſe have got the <hi>Sabeans</hi> to have fetched away the flocks of ſheepe, as well as the droves of greater cattell; he could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them eaſily; why then doth he cauſe fire from Heaven to come down, the fire of God to conſume them.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, his reaſon for this was to put the greater ſting into the affliction. He would not have the ſheepe taken away after the ſame manner that the Oxen and Camels were, that he might ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate <hi>Jobs</hi> trouble, and provoke him if he could to be paſſionate againſt God, yea and (for that was his great deſigne) to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God; therefore he procures fire from Heaven to fall upon the ſheepe, thereby to beget an opinion in <hi>Job</hi> that God was now become his enemy as well as man. When we ſuffer from man, then the afflicted ſoule flies to God, makes his complaint and moane to him; as doubtleſſe <hi>Job</hi> did when he heard of thoſe cruell <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and what they had done; but leſt <hi>Job</hi> ſhould reſort in his thoughts to Heaven, and comfort himſelfe in God againe, the next meſſenger telleth him that God is his enemy too, that the <hi>fire of God</hi> is fallen upon the ſheepe, an extraordinary fire; as if hee ſhould ſay, God fighteth againſt thee as well as the <hi>Sabeans</hi>; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las now to whom ſhould <hi>Job</hi> make his moane! That ſpeech of <hi>Eli</hi> concerning ſinne may well be applyed to ſuffering, <hi>If one man ſinne againſt another the Iudge ſhall judge him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.25,</note> 
                  <hi>but if a man ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him?</hi> So if a man ſuffer from men, he may goe unto God, but if God himſelfe doe appeare to be an enemy and to fight againſt us, to whom ſhall we goe? Indeed <hi>Iob</hi> knew how to goe to God, though he did appeare as an enemy; but that is the greateſt ſtraight, and to doe thus notes the greateſt ſpirituall both skill and ſtrength. Hence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Satans great deſigne againſt the people of God or any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God is to provoke them to ill thoughts of God</hi>; to perſwade
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98733:88"/>
them that God is their enemy, to bring the love and good will of God into ſuſpition; therefore he cauſeth this great fire, and (it is like) formed the ſervants language in that cutting phraſe, <hi>The fire of God is fallen upon the ſheepe.</hi> Thou canſt not put this off, as thou mighteſt doe the other, and ſay, this is but the malice or the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe of the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> that rob'd me of my goods, and ſlew my ſervants; No, thou ſhalt ſee now that God himſelfe is angry, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven frownes upon thee, the fire of God from Heaven conſumes thee. Turne over the records of all antiquity, and ſee whether God ever dealt thus with any, but thoſe curſed <hi>Sodomites</hi> upon <hi>whom God rained fire from Heaven</hi>; Thou who commeſt ſo neare them in the puniſhment, haſt reaſon to judge thy ſelfe not farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them in ſin.</p>

If God doth but with-draw his comforts, the ſoule ſinkes under ſmalleſt tryals, how then can it ſtand if God ſhould reveale his wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, when we are in great tryals.</p>
               <p>It may here be queſtioned, why the ſheepe were conſumed with fire, rather than any other of his cattell, rather then any other of his ſubſtance?</p>
               <p>There are two things in that. Firſt, the ſheepe were uſed in Sacrifice. <hi>When the daies of their feaſting were ended,</hi> Job <hi>offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Sacrifice,</hi> and the ſheepe chiefly were offered in Sacrifice. Now Satan by conſuming the ſheepe hoped to faſten this upon <hi>Iob,</hi> if poſſibly he could, that God was angry with his very Sacrifices. God was angry with his ſervices. As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Doeſt thou thinke that the offering up of thy ſheepe in Sacrifice hath beene pleaſing to God? Certainly if the fire of thoſe Sacrifices had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted God, if he had ſmelt a ſavour of reſt in them</hi> (as he is ſaid to have done, when <hi>Noah</hi> offered Sacrifice after the flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21.) <hi>he would never have ſent a fire from Heaven to conſume them.</hi> That is conceived by Expoſitors to be an eſpeciall reaſon why the ſheepe were conſumed, namely to caſt <hi>Iob</hi> upon this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,<note place="margin">Prov. 15.8.</note> that his very Sacrifices were rejected of God: that he might conclude of himſelfe (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the wicked) <hi>that his Sacrifices were an abomination to the Lord,</hi> and to ſhew that God would now have no more of his Sacrifices, God himſelfe made
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98733:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one Sacrifice of them all. But <hi>Origen</hi> brings in <hi>Job</hi> excellently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting this ſuggeſtion upon Satan. I ſacrificed now one and then another of my Sheepe to God, but now bleſſed be God, who hath accepted all my flocke as one Burnt-offering.</p>
               <p>Againe, The Sheepe were conſumed by fire, as to make <hi>Job</hi> conceive that his former ſervices were rejected, ſo to take him off and diſcourage him from offering any more ſuch ſervices; to make him deſpaire of ever thriving in the way of thoſe duties: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſurely God is ſo angry now, that all my ſervices, all my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices will never appeaſe him nor profit me: therefore I were as good lay by theſe duties as performe them, when I get no good. This is a dangerous temptation; if Satan by ſuch prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt holy duties, can cauſe us to lay them by, the day is wonne: for then the ſoule is left naked and unarm'd. We have not then ſo much as a bulruſh in our hands to ſmite him, or a paper breaſt-plate to ſecure our ſelves. If we give over praying and ſeeking, we have no ground to expect Chriſt either aſſiſting or protecting us. That for the ſecond affliction.</p>

                  <hi>While he was yet ſpeaking, there came alſo another and ſaid, the</hi> Caldeans <hi>made out three Bands. Caldeans</hi> ſometime note a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or a ranke of men, ſuch as were Diviners, Soothſayers and Aſtrologers, theſe are in Scripture called <hi>Caldeans.</hi> As the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> called ſuch skilfull perſons <hi>Gymnoſophiſtes,</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi> called them their <hi>Magi,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> called them <hi>Augures,</hi> ſo the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> called them <hi>Caldeans.</hi> When <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> dreamed a dreame, it is ſaid, that he ſent for the <hi>Diviners and the Aſtrologers, and the</hi> Caldeans;<note place="margin">Dan. 2.3.</note> and afterward the <hi>Caldeans</hi> take up all, he ſaid to the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> and the <hi>Caldeans</hi> ſaid to the King: The <hi>Caldeans</hi> were put for all thoſe that undertooke the art of divining and interpreting dreames. But here by the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> are to be underſtood, not a condition of men, but a Nation of men, or the people inhabiting <hi>Chaldea</hi>: frequently ſpoken of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98733:89"/>
by the Prophets, and deſcribed to the life by the Prophet <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hab. 1.6, 7.</note> chap. 1. where the Lord threatned to ſend the <hi>Caldeans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his people, and then deſcribes them, <hi>That haſtie and bitter Nation, their Horſes are ſwifter then the Leopard, and more rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then the evening Wolves:</hi> Such a kind of people they were who were ſtirred up by Satan to take away the Camels of <hi>Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are ſaid to make out three Bands to ſpoile; They were a people like the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> delighting in warre and robbery; ſo much the Etymologie of their Name <hi>Chaſdim,</hi> (which is the word in the Originall) implieth, being derived from <hi>Sadad,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to robbe and ſpoile. Theſe were a wicked generation, yet theſe prevaile over the eſtate of <hi>Job</hi>; victory doth not alwayes attend a juſt cauſe. The way of the wicked often proſpers, and the way of theſe wicked <hi>Caldeans</hi> proſpered ſo often, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> complaines to God as one ſcandaliz'd at it: <hi>Thou art of purer eyes then to behold evill, and canst not looke on ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deale treacherouſly and holdeſt thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous then he.</hi> If ever wee ſhould be brought upon a like caſe, to argue it thus with God, or (as <hi>Jeremie</hi> did, <hi>chap.</hi> 12.1.) to plead with God about his judgements, let us remember to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh our hearts (before we open our mouthes) with the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi> concluſion in that place, <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord,</hi> though the wicked devoure the man that is more righteous then he. It is very rare that God makes one good man his rod to ſcourge another: he uſually makes the worſt of men his rod, his ſtaffe, his Sword, to inflict either tryalls or judgements upon his people. The durty Scullion ſcowres the ſilver veſſell, and makes it both cleane and bright for his maſters uſe.</p>

               <p>THis was, as the fourth and laſt, ſo the greateſt of all Satans aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, the moſt fierce and terrible charge that <hi>Job</hi> had all the day, and Satan reſerves this untill the evening, till <hi>Job</hi> was ſpent
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98733:89"/>
and ſpiritleſſe as he hoped. I ſhall note this in generall from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Satan uſually keepes his greateſt strength and moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent temptations unto the laſt.</hi> When he thinkes we are at the weakeſt, then he commeth with his ſtrongeſt aſſaults. If Satan had ſent <hi>Job</hi> word of the death of his children firſt, all the reſt would have beene as nothing to him: he would not have regarded the loſſe of his Cattell when he heard that all his children were cruſhed to death by the fall of the houſe. As ſome one great evill falling upon us, takes the heart off from having any ſenſe or joy in a leſſer good; ſo one great evill ſwallowes up the ſenſe and feeling of a leſſer evill: that great evill which fell upon the Wife of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> when ſhe heard that <hi>the Arke of God was taken,</hi> afflicted her ſo extreamely, that ſhe could not at all rejoyce in the birth of her ſonne; ſhe had no ſence of that. Here was therefore the cunning of Satan, leſt <hi>Job</hi> ſhould have loſt the ſmart of the leſſer afflictions, leaſt they ſhould have beene all ſwallowed up in the greater, he brings them out in order, the leaſt firſt, the greateſt is reſerved for the laſt. We obſerve in warre, that when once the great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance are diſcharged, the Souldiers are not afraid of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; ſo when a great batterie is made by ſome thundering terrible judgement upon the ſoule, or upon the body or eſtate of any man; the noyſe and feares of leſſer evills are drown'd and abated. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Satan keepes his greateſt ſhot to the laſt, that the ſmall might be heard and felt, and that the laſt comming in greater ſtrength might find the leaſt ſtrength to reſiſt it.</p>
               <p>And that this was a greater affliction then any of, or then all the former, is ſo cleare that I ſhall not need to ſtay long in the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of it, only to quicken the point a little, take notice of the greatneſſe of it in 5 reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It appeareth without controverſie to be the greateſt of all, becauſe it was upon his children: a mans children are more then all that he hath in the world: a mans children are himſelfe, every child is the father multiplyed; A ſonne is the fathers bowells: and therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to <hi>Philemon</hi> concerning <hi>Oneſimus, whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have begotten in my bonds; (ſc.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philem. v. 12.</note> to the faith of Chriſt) <hi>Receive him who is mine owne bowels</hi>; A ſpirituall ſonne is the very bowells of a Miniſter; he doth but allude to a naturall ſonne, a ſonne is the very bowels of the father; this affliction rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto the very bowels of <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe; Satan had no leave to afflict the body of <hi>Job,</hi> and yet you ſee he afflicts him in his very bowels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:98733:90"/>Secondly, The greatneſſe of it is ſeene in this, his children were all taken away; To looſe all our children, is a grievous as to looſe an only child; Now that is made a cauſe of the higheſt ſorrows, Zach. 12.10. <hi>They ſhall mourne for him, as one that mourneth for an only ſonne:</hi> that is, they ſhall mourne moſt bitterly. Now as the meaſure of mercies may be taken by the comforts which they produce, ſo we may take the meaſure of an affliction by the ſorrow which it produceth, And that is the greateſt affliction which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the greateſt ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It was a further greatning of the affliction, that they were all taken away ſuddenly. Had death ſent them ſummons, by its uſuall meſſenger ſickneſſe, but a day before to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it had much ſweetned the bitterneſſe of this cup; but to heare they were dead before he knew they were ſick; yea when he thought they were merry and rejoycing, how ſad was this.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That they died a violent death, by a mighty wind ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the houſe downe upon them. Had they dyed in their beds (though ſuddenly) it had bin ſome eaſe to the Fathers heart: vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death hath an impreſſion of wrath upon it. And men can hardly judge well of thoſe, who fall by ſuch judgements. Suſpition will ariſe, if cenſure paſſe not, from better men then <hi>Barbarians,</hi> if they ſee a viper on the hand of a <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 28. It is more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable from our Saviours queſtion, that thoſe eighteene upon whom the Tower in <hi>Siloe</hi> fell, and ſlew them, were commonly ſuppoſed greater ſinners, or ſinners above all men that dwelt in <hi>Hieruſalem, Luk.</hi> 18.4.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They were all taken away when they were feaſting; and this did exceedingly aggravate the affliction upon <hi>Job,</hi> that his children were all deſtroied feaſting; for you know what the thoughts of <hi>Job</hi> were concerning his children at their feaſting; after they had done, he offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all, for he ſaid, <hi>it may be my ſonnes have ſinned and curſed God in their hearts.</hi> Now at this time, when Satan knew that <hi>Job</hi> was moſt ſolicitous leſt his children ſhould ſinne, at that time doth he deſtroy them; that ſo their father might be afflicted with the thought, that his children died unreconciled to God, that they died with ſinne upon them unrepented of: That they died a double death, death at once ſeaſing upon both ſoule and body. This then was a further degree of Satans malice, to wound, vexe and grieve the ſpirit of <hi>Job</hi> unto the utmoſt. How ſadly and piſſionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98733:90"/>
did <hi>David</hi> lament <hi>Abſoloms</hi> death? Some conceive this was the head of the Arrow that pierced him, becauſe he feared his ſonne died in a ſinfull condition, he was ſuddenly taken away in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, unreconciled either to God or man. Such a thought might fall upon <hi>Jobs</hi> heart; my children are ſuddenly dead, and dead fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, it may be they forgot God, it is poſſible they ſinned in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and curſed God in their hearts. Alas my children died before they could ſo much as thinke of death: I feare they are gone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to Hell, where they ſhall weepe for evermore. Doubtleſſe Satan did or might faſten ſuch a temptation upon his heart who was ſo tender of his childrens ſoules, and ſo fearfull of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in feaſting. So then it is cleare from all theſe particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, that this was the greateſt affliction.</p>
               <p>Be prepared then, not onely to receive another affliction, but to receive a greater affliction, and have thoughts of receiving the greateſt affliction at the laſt. Satan will come with his ſtrongeſt aſſaults when thou art weakeſt. At the time of death when he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he can doe no more, but that he muſt then doe it, or never doe it, then thou ſhalt be ſure to have the ſtrongeſt temptations.</p>
               <p>It ſhould therefore ſtirre up the people of God, ſtill to looke for more and more ſtrength to beare afflictions and tentations, and to beg from Chriſt, the greateſt ſtrength at laſt, becauſe they may juſtly feare the greateſt temptations at laſt. If as Satan doth greaten his temptations Chriſt doth greaten his aſſiſtance, we ſhall be able to beare them and be more then conquerours over them.</p>
               <p>So much of this fourth charge in the generall, I ſhall now open the words more particularly, (for thoſe in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> I ſhall not need to ſay any thing of them, they have been handled before at the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe,</hi> which runnes thus; <hi>And there was a day when his ſonnes and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their Eldeſt brothers houſe.</hi>) The 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> deſcribes the manner of this tryall; <hi>And behold there came a great wind from the wilderneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>There came a great wind.</hi>] It was a wind, and a great wind that came. The wind is elegantly ſaid to come (as the Sunne) out of his chamber, and rejoycing as a ſtrong man to runne a race, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.5. Hence the word which the Latines uſe for the wind, is derived from a word that ſignifies, <hi>to come.</hi> Becauſe the wind comes with force and violence.<note place="margin">

               <p>There were many wilderneſſes? Here wilderneſſe is ſet downe indefinitely. There was the wilderneſſe of <hi>Maon,</hi> and the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Ziph,</hi> and many other wilderneſſes ſpoken of in Scripture. What wilderneſſe was this?</p>
               <p>It is conceived, that this was either the wilderneſſe of <hi>Idumea,</hi> or <hi>Edom,</hi> ſpoken of 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.8. or elſe it was <hi>Arabia</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, which is by way of eminency called <hi>The wilderneſſe.</hi> It came from the wilderneſſe, that is, it came over that part which is called <hi>Arabia deſorta,</hi> or <hi>Arabia</hi> the wild.</p>
               <p>When it is ſaid, this wind came from the wilderneſſe, the coaſt is cleared, but the cauſe and ſtirrer up of this wind is concealed.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98733:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
miſchiefe; Satan Prince of the ayre raiſed up this mighty winde.</p>
               <p>Windes are ſaid ſometimes to come from God; As <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.13. <hi>The Lord brought an Eaſt-winde upon the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>that it was covered with Locuſts,</hi> (one of the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi>) And verſe 19. <hi>The Lord turned a mighty West-wind which tooke away the Locuſts.</hi> And <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.31. <hi>There went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought Quailes from the Sea,</hi> Jonah 1.4. <hi>The Lord ſent out a great wind into the Sea.</hi> The Heathens (who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the World among ſundry gods) gave the winds to <hi>Aeolus,</hi> whom they ſuppoſed to have them all ſhut up and lock't cloſe in his lodge, till he gave them command to fly abroad. It is an argument of a divine power to rule the winds. Who is this ſay thoſe Sea-men, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.27. that even <hi>the winds and the Sea obey him.</hi> As God only cauſeth the Sunne to ſhine, and the raine to fall, ſo the winds to blow. The wind is originally in the hand of God,<note place="margin">Prov. 30.4.</note> 
                  <hi>He gathers the wind in his fists</hi> (ſaith <hi>Agur</hi> of God,) <hi>and ſendeth it which way he pleaſeth.</hi> But the winds were put for that preſent into the hand of Satan, and he had leave to raiſe a ſtorme for this ſpeciall purpoſe. So then, <hi>there came a great wind from beyond the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,</hi> that is, Satan ſtirred up a mighty wind in thoſe parts and quarters, <hi>which came</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſmote the foure corners of the houſe, and it fell upon the Young men, and they are dead.</hi>] Here we ſee what was the worke of this wind. As it is deſcribed by the region from whence the wind came, ſo by the effects which it wrought being come, <hi>It ſmote the foure corners of the houſe</hi>; The Hebrew word is the ſame uſed verſe 11. <hi>Touch all that he hath.</hi> According to Satans ſence this wind, <hi>touched the foure corners of the houſe.</hi> The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the houſe are the ſtrength of the houſe, and the foure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are all the ſtrength. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called the <hi>corner ſtone,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the ſtrength and binding of the Church, he holds all together. This wind ſmote the foure corners at once; It may ſeeme very ſtrange, that one wind, a wind deſcribed to come out of one quarter, a Southerne wind, as this is conceived to have bin, comming from the wilderneſſe, that this one wind ſhould ſtrike all the foure parts of the houſe together: muſt it not be a wind from the foure quarters of Heaven which ſtrikes the foure corners of a houſe? I anſwer, This was an extraordinary wind, there was a wonder carryed on the wings of this wind, therefore you have an <hi>Ecce</hi> of admiration, <hi>a Behold</hi> ſet in the beginning of this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

This wind did not worke according to the ordinary rate of winds. Or we may ſay, It was a whirle-wind, that tempeſtuous whirle-wind, which Philoſophers call <hi>Typhon</hi>; Such a wind, as whirles about in a circle, and ſo it might fetch-in or aſſault all the parts and corners of the houſe with one blaſt. Further, We muſt take notice, that Satan was in this wind: He acted and wrought mightily with it for the ſure and ſuddaine effecting of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full overthrow, the Devill ſpirited this wind. The wind (though for the quickneſſe and power of it, called a ſpirit) is a dull and weake thing compared to a ſpirit.</p>
               <q>There came a great wind from the wilderneſſe, and ſmote the foure corners of the houſe, and it fell upon the Young-men and they are dead.</q>
               <p>But what became of his three Daughters, did they eſcape? They are not named, but they alſo were involved. It is uſuall in Scripture, under one Sexe, the ſuperiour Sexe to compriſe both. All <hi>Jobs</hi> children periſhed under the ruines of that falling houſe. Hence Obſerve,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That Satan being left at his owne diſpoſe, can raiſe and enrage stormes and tempeſts.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. <hi>That ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie winds and tempests fulfill the will of God</hi>; The windes goe often on Gods errand; but as often as the Lord gives leave, theſe ſtormie windes and tempeſts fulfill Satans will; Not his alone, much leſſe againſt the will of God. Satan cannot raiſe ſo much wind by his owne power as will wave a feather, but when God ſaith goe <hi>doe ſuch and ſuch things, then the winds likewiſe fulfill his will:</hi> And then he can raiſe wind enough to move Mountaines, and raze the foundations of the proudeſt and ſtrongeſt buildings. It is reported that ſome wicked wretches trade with witches for windes, they buy winds of the Devill; A moſt abhominable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize; and the Lord doth anſwer them juſtly, to let them have what they pay for, windes of the Devill; as he ſpeakes in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſa. 66.4.</note>

               </p>
               <p>We may obſerve ſomewhat more generally from all theſe foure ſore afflictions conſidered together. As firſt, <hi>We ſee how quickly the beauty of all worldly bleſſings may be blaſted. Job</hi> in the morning had an eſtate, as great and as good as his heart could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in worldly things, there was luſter and ſtrength in and upon all he had, but before night he had nothing but ſorrow to ſup upon; He had no retinue of ſervants left, but foure, reſerved only to report his loſſes. In one day all's gone. It is added as an aggravation of <hi>Babylons</hi> down-fall, that <hi>her judgements ſhall come upon her in one day,</hi> Revel. 18.8. <hi>Therefore ſhall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning and famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire, for ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</hi> In one day all the beauty of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be blaſted. We need not now trouble our ſelves to thinke <hi>Babylon</hi> is in a great deale of ſtrength and beauty and glory, ſurely there muſt be a long time ſpent in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and acting the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no, the Lord can blaſt her beauty and deſtroy her power in a day; and the Text ſaith, he will doe ſo, <hi>in one day all her plagues ſhall come upon her.</hi> That which <hi>Babylon</hi> hath beene gathering many yeares ſhall be ſcattered in a moment. She thinkes that by her wiſdome and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy ſhe hath laid ſuch a foundation of her owne greatneſſe as ſhall never be ſhaken; And therefore concludes, <hi>I ſit a Queene and am no widow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow.</hi> Yet all her ſtrength ſhall not hold out one day, when God in his diſpleaſure ſhall lay ſiege againſt her walls. So when yee looke upon other great and mighty, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and flouriſhing enemies, ſuch as <hi>flouriſh like greene bay trees,</hi> remember the Lord in one day can wither their branches and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98733:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kill their roots, yee root them up. Certainly the ſtrength of the Lord is as mighty for the deſtroying of his enemies, as it is for the afflicting of his owne people: If he ſometimes gives commiſſion to take away all their comforts in a day, when their eſtates are higheſt and ſtrongeſt built; Surely he will at laſt give Commiſſions for as ſpeedy a diſpatch againſt the eſtates of his greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>And this may be unto us all, matter of Admonition, to prepare for changes, to eſteeme creatures as they are, <hi>periſhing ſubſtance.</hi> Who ever had an eſtate better gotten, better bottom'd or better managed then <hi>Job?</hi> yet all was overthrowne and ſwept away in a moment. <hi>We can never expect too much from God, nor too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from the creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, We may learne from the fore-going ſtory of theſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, conſidering that Satan was the contriver and engeneere, who ſet all a worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Satan is mighty both in power and policy for the effecting of his deſignes, if God give him liberty and leave.</hi> You ſee he doth not faile or miſſe in the leaſt, he brings every affliction upon <hi>Job</hi> in the perfection of it, and he doth not bungle at it, or doe his worke by halves; but he is quicke and ſpeedy, both in laying the plot and executing it. There is nothing in this inferiour world able to ſtand before him, no creature, no man, if God let him alone. The good Angels can match, yea and maſter devils, there is no doubt of that: but if God ſtop his Angels and with-draw his hand, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill would quickly over-runne all the world.<note place="margin">Eph. 6.</note>

I pronounce, that in all he hath done, in all he hath ſaid, <hi>Job hath not charged God fooliſhly.</hi> That in the generall for the ſum of the Context, and for the parts of it.</p>
               <p>To begin firſt with what <hi>Job</hi> did, his actions.</p>

               <p>Job <hi>aroſe.</hi>] This was his firſt action; to ariſe is properly an act of one that ſitteth; he is ſaid to ariſe that before did ſit or lie. But yet in Scripture to ariſe is not alwayes taken ſo ſtrictly, neither is it in this place. To ariſe in the Scripture language notes two things. Firſt the ſpeedineſſe of doing a thing: when a man doth a thing inſtantly or preſently, he is ſaid to ariſe to doe it, to ariſe and doe it, though he were ſtanding or walking before. This is an Hebraiſme, <hi>He aroſe and rent his mantle,</hi> that is, <hi>He preſently rent his mantle</hi> upon the hearing of theſe <hi>meſſages,</hi> eſpecially the laſt. And ſo you have the word in divers places, as Judg. 20.18. <hi>The children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>aroſe and went to the houſe of the Lord,</hi> that is, they went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently up to the houſe of the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.31. <hi>Then</hi> Joab <hi>aroſe and went to</hi> Abſolom, the meaning is only this, that upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of that meſſage, he went with ſpeed, he made no delayes: And <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.18. when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> exhorted them to the great worke of building the houſe of the Lord, the people ſhewing their willingneſſe and readineſſe expreſt it thus, <hi>Let us riſe up and build,</hi> that is, let us build (as we ſay) out of hand, ſpeedily.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>To ariſe</hi> implyes the courage, conſtancy and ſtrength of thoſe who undertake or goe about a buſineſſe, they ariſe and doe it, that is, they doe it with ſpirit: So here it may import as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98733:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much concerning <hi>Job</hi> in his ſufferings, <hi>He aroſe and rent his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> that is, though he heard all theſe ſad relations, yet his ſpirit was not overwhelmed, he was not drowned in thoſe ſorrowes, he did not ſinke downe under them, but <hi>he aroſe and rent his mantle,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had raiſed himſelfe up to wreſtle with the temptation and the tempter, to wreſtle with Satan himſelfe. In this ſenſe the Lord is ſaid to ariſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.8, 9. where there is that ſad deſcription of the Land, <hi>The Earth mourneth and languiſheth,</hi> Lebanon <hi>is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now will I riſe ſaith the Lord, now will I be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> that is, <hi>now will I come and ſhew my ſelfe with a mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the deliverance of my people.</hi> I will be exalted and they ſhall rejoyce. That prayer of the old Church, <hi>Ariſe O Lord, and let thine enemies be ſcattered,</hi> hath the ſame intendment, deſiring the Lord to goe forth armed with ſtrength for the helpe of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the ſubduing of their enemies. Thus <hi>Job</hi> aroſe, bound with a four-fold cord of affliction: he raiſed himſelfe up like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> though in humility, yet with ſtrength and courage. And ſo it is oppoſed to the ſinking of the ſpirit under troubles, as you know the ſpirit of <hi>Eli</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.18. There was ſad tydings brought to <hi>Eli</hi> concerning the death of his ſonnes and the taking of the Arke, the Text ſaith, <hi>As ſoone as he heard theſe things, he fell downe backward,</hi> he had no ſpirit, no ſtrength left in him, he did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and rend his garment, but he ſunke downe and brake his necke. When <hi>Nabal</hi> heard of the danger that his churliſh and inhoſpitable anſwer had almoſt drawne upon him, 1 Sam. 25.37. <hi>His heart dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within him, and he became as a ſtone.</hi> When all that <hi>Job</hi> had was dead and gone, his heart lived, yea he was <hi>(erecto animo)</hi> of a raiſed ſpirit, not only when he aroſe, but when he fell upon the ground: for then he worſhipped, and worſhip is the lifting up of the ſoule to God: <hi>In the worſhip of God while the body is upon the knee, the mind is or ought to be upon the wing.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And rent his mantle.</q>
               <p>That is the ſecond act. Renting or garments is very often ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in Scripture, and wee finde it eſpecially in theſe two caſes. In caſe of extreame ſorrow, and in caſe of extreame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>
               <p>In caſe of extreame ſorrow, and that of two kinds, either in the ſorrows of afflictions or in the ſorrowes repentance; in both theſe we find renting of the garments.</p>

               <p>Secondly, It was uſed in token of Repentance, when ſorrowes for ſinne brake forth and multiplied, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.6. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe upon the defeat, flight and ſlaughter of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> before <hi>Ai,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>he rent his cloathes and fell to the Earth:</hi> This renting was of their garments in reſpect of the outward affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but withall in token of repentance, for <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple humbled themſelves with faſting. So when the booke of the Law was read to <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and he ſaw how farre they had departed from the rule and word of God, it is ſaid, <hi>He rent his clothes, and he was afraid, he humbled himſelf and his heart was tender before God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be objected that in the 2. <hi>Joel</hi> 13. when we are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to rent the heart, we are ſtop'd from renting the garment, <hi>Rent your hearts and not your garments,</hi> in the caſe of Repentance.</p>
               <p>For anſwer to that I ſay, the <hi>Not</hi> there is not an abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of renting the garment, it is not ſo much a negation, as a direction, <hi>Rent your hearts and not your garments,</hi> that is, <hi>Rent your hearts rather then your garments,</hi> or <hi>Rent your hearts more then your garments,</hi> or <hi>be ſure that you rent your hearts whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ver you doe with your garments,</hi> Negations doe not alwayes quite deny a thing, in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. take an inſtance for it, where the Apoſtle treating of the preheminence of the Goſpell in the new diſpenſation ſaith, <hi>Who hath made us able Miniſters, not of the letter, but of the Spirit. Not,</hi> there doth not deny, as if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt did not ſpeake and publiſh the letter of the word:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98733:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the letter of the word is the veſſell wherin the Spirit is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and unleſſe we ſpeake the letter to the eare, the Spirit cannot in an ordinary way come into the heart; therefore underſtand the Apoſtles meaning thus, <hi>he hath made us able Ministers, not of the letter but of the Spirit,</hi> that is, he hath made us Miniſters ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſpirit then of the letter, or more of the ſpirit then of the letter, becauſe of the promiſe of the plentifull effuſion of the Spirit, after the aſcenſion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A further inſtance we have in that ſpeech of God, <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice.</hi> That is, rather mercy then ſacrifice. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is not rejected, but mercy is preferr'd. So <hi>Rent your hearts and not your garments,</hi> that is, rather rent your hearts then your garments; For otherwiſe you find that not only it was lawfull (as in the former places) in times of repentance and ſorrow to rend the garments, but they are taxed becauſe they did not repent and rend their garments. The not renting the garment is charged as a conviction of an un-rent heart.<note place="margin">Jerem. 36.24.</note> When the roull of curſes that <hi>Baruch</hi> wrote from the mouth of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was read before <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojakim</hi> and his Courtiers, the King cut the roll with a pen-knife and caſt it into the fire, their impenitence is thus deſcribed, <hi>yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the King nor any of his ſervants that heard all thoſe words</hi>; As if it had beene ſaid, this was a time that called them aloud to rend their garments, to humble themſelves and repent before the Lord, when they heard ſuch words as theſe, (cloathed with their own ſinne and Gods wrath) read unto them, but they did it not; <hi>yet they were not afraid, neither did they rend their garments.</hi> So then, renting of the garment was uſed as a ceremony of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as a ſhadow of godly ſorrow; It had nothing in it ſelfe to move God, only it teſtified the greatneſſe of their griefe, that their hearts did rend as their garments were rent.</p>
               <p>Further, Renting of the garment was uſed in caſe of extreame indignation. Indignation is anger &amp; ſorrow boyl'd up to the height. It is as it were the extract and ſpirit of them both. And it is ſtir'd eſpecially when the eare of a man is filled with a voice of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, or his eye with a ſpectacle of bold tranſcendent wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt the Lord.

text ſaith, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> rent his cloathes with indignation; that report fill'd him with a mixture of griefe and anger; he was grieved that the holy name of God was blaſphemed, he was angry with the blaſphemer: theſe cauſed holy indignation, and this the renting of his garments.<note place="margin">Acts 14.13.</note> Thus alſo when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had reſtored the Creeple at <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> the ſuperſtitious <hi>Lystrians</hi> would have done ſacrifice to them as gods; which when the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> heard of, and ſaw the preparations (Oxen and Garlands brought to the gates) for that abhominable Idolatry, <hi>they rent their cloathes, and ranne in among the people ſaying, Sirs, why doe you theſe things? we alſo are men of like paſſions with you.</hi> They rent their cloathes with indignation, being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and vext to ſee men ſo beſotted, and God ſo diſhonoured.</p>
               <p>This act of <hi>Job</hi> in the Text, renting his garments, may referre to either of theſe, it may referre to all theſe. If it be demanded why did <hi>Job</hi> rend his garments? I anſwer, firſt, He rent his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the greatneſſe of that ſorrow that was upon him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his outward affliction. Secondly, He rent his garments, to teſtifie his deepe humiliation under the hand of God, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for all his ſinnes. Thirdly, He rent his garments, being filled with indignation at thoſe blaſphemies which Satan ſuggeſted to him; This latter I cleare thus; you know it was the maine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, the very plot of Satan to provoke <hi>Job</hi> to blaſpheme God, doe this ſaith he, <hi>Touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> He did promiſe this to himſelfe and did undertake with God to bring <hi>Job</hi> to that height of impatience. If ſo, then there is no queſtion, but as theſe meſſengers of ſorrow came to him, ſo Satan came with them and pointed every meſſage with this or the like poyſonous ſuggeſtion. Now ſee what a maſter you ſerve, now blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God, why ſhouldeſt thou make ſcruple of thinking, or of ſpeaking evill of him, who hath powred out all theſe evills upon thee. Never ſtand ſo much upon his honour, who ſtands ſo little upon thy comfort. It is no queſtion but Satan provok'd <hi>Job</hi> in ſome ſuch manner. He was not wiſe to promote his own ends, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he did plie him with temptations to blſphemy. Now <hi>Iob</hi> being moſt ſenſible of theſe temptations, it being to him (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 42 10.) as a Sword in his bowels, while the enemy ſaid unto him, <hi>where is now thy God,</hi> he ariſes with indignation and ſoule-abhorrence of theſe injections, <hi>ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his garments,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>And ſhaved his head.</hi>] Shaving of the head was uſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to expreſſe ſorrow, ſometimes to expreſſe bondage, and I find it uſed in Scripture in oppoſition to both theſe, <hi>ſc.</hi> in times of joy and liberty.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Shaving of the head was uſed as a note of ſorrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15.2. the Lord ſpeaking by his Prophet of the great affliction that ſhould come upon the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſaith, <hi>On all their heads ſhall be bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and every beard cut off</hi>; that is, they ſhall mourne, that's the meaning of it. And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12. <hi>In that day did the Lord God of Hoſts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldneſſe</hi>; that is, to ſhaving of themſelves or cutting off their haire; the meaning of it in joyning baldneſſe and mourning was only this, to ſhew that there ſhould be extreame ſorrow and mourning in the land, <hi>The Lord calleth to mourning and baldneſſe,</hi> that is, to an exceeding great mourning, ſuch as thoſe mournings uſed to be when they ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their heads; And the Prophet puts in this as an aggravation of their ſinne, that when the Lord called for ſuch <hi>a mourning as was joyned with baldneſſe and ſhaving the head,</hi> that then there ſhould be <hi>joy and gladneſſe, ſlaying Oxen, and killing Sheepe, eating fleſh, and drinking wine.</hi> See this more cleare, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.29. when the Prophet fore-ſhewes the great affliction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he thus beſpeakes them, <hi>Cut off thine haire O</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and cast it away, and take up a lamentation.</hi> To adde one inſtance more, <hi>Mica.</hi> 1.16. In caſe of their ſore affliction the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Make thee bald and pole thee for thy delicate children, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large thy baldneſſe as the Eagle</hi>; The meaning of all is, mourne bitterly, or mourne greatly for thy delicate children, thy delicate and ſweet children they are deſtroyed, mourne greatly for them, <hi>enlarge thy baldneſſe as the Eagle</hi>; As the <hi>Eagle,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Eagle</hi> (as naturaliſts obſerve) caſteth her feathers, and her head is many times quite bald, therefore it is ſaid here, <hi>enlarge thy bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as the Eagle,</hi> that is, be exceeding bald, cut off all thy haire in that great mourning. We may illuſtrate this by a contrary rule given by this Prophet <hi>Jeremie,</hi> and likewiſe by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when mourning was forbidden, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.6. where he ſpeakes of ſome that ſhould die and have none to mourne for them, he ſaith, <hi>they ſhall not lament for them, nor make themſelves bald for them,</hi> Ezek. 24.17. <hi>Make no mourning for the dead,</hi> what followeth? <hi>Bind the tire of thine head upon thee,</hi> when they ſhould keepe on their haire, their tire, that was an argument that there was no mourning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:98733:98"/>Further we find, that the cutting off the haire, the ſhaving of the head, was a ſigne of bondage and reproach; when <hi>David</hi> ſent meſſengers to <hi>Hanun,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 10.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Samuel</hi> records, that <hi>Hanun</hi> tooke the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers <hi>and ſhaved off the one halfe of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle,</hi> and the men were exceedingly aſhamed; now the ſhame was not only becauſe their beards were halfe cut off, for if that had beene all, they might quickly have cut off the other halfe and have delivered themſelves from the ſhame; for they were at liberty: but it is therefore ſaid that the men were greatly aſhamed, becauſe amongſt them it vvas a marke of ſhame and ſlavery to be ſhaven. Hereupon <hi>David</hi> giveth order <hi>that they ſhould tarry at</hi> Jericho, <hi>till their beards were growen</hi>; it was a diſhonour to be ſhaved; And it is noted in <hi>Plutarch</hi> concerning <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> that when he had a mind to ſit cloſe at his ſtudy and vvould not goe abroad, or be interrupted by viſits of friends at home, that he would ſhave himſelfe, that ſo he might be aſhamed to goe forth or ſee any body, but be conſtrained to keepe to his booke for tvvo or three moneths together till his haire vvere grovvne againe:<note place="margin">Ezek. 29.18.</note> The bondage and reproach that <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> brought upon <hi>Tyrus</hi> is thus deſcribed, <hi>Every head was made bald.</hi>

Thus the ſhaving of the head in <hi>Job</hi> might be a ſigne both of his ſorrovv and great reproach that vvas come upon him, being one novv that vvas ready to be mocked and made the ſcorne and by-vvord of the vvorld, as vve ſee afterward he was, during this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
               <p>Yet it is conſiderable from Scripture example, that the cutting off the haire, and ſhaving of the head had not alvvayes either of theſe ſignifications hitherto diſcuſs'd, but did vary according to the diverſity of places and of times. In the Booke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> we reade that cutting and ſhaving of the haire, vvas a token of joy and liberty both together.

I confeſſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe inſtances come home enough to the point: both of theſe neglecting the care and culture of their bodies in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, now being delivered, prepare themſelves by ſhaving and trimming the hayre for the preſence of thoſe Kings.

               </p>
               <p>There is an Objection that may be made concerning this act of <hi>Job,</hi> (becauſe afterward it is ſaid, <hi>that in all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not</hi>) whether or not <hi>Job</hi> might ſhave his head without ſinne? for you have an expreſſe rule to the contrary, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.27. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.5. <hi>You ſhall not round the corners of your heads, neither ſhalt thou marre the corners of thy beard,</hi> and ſo you have it againe in <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.1. that they ſhould not <hi>cut their haire or make any baldneſſe upon their heads for the dead,</hi> namely by ſhaving or cutting off the haire. How is it therefore here that <hi>Job</hi> ſhaved himſelfe for the death of his children, and in regard of thoſe great troubles that were upon him?</p>
               <p>I anſwer briefly for that, firſt, <hi>Job</hi> lived (as we have cleared when we ſpake of the booke in generall) before that Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which did prohibit the cutting of the haire in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It appeares in thoſe places, where thoſe Lawes are ſet downe, that the Lord did forbid only conformity to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; they muſt not ſhave or cut themſelves, as the Heathen did:<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:98733:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>We will obſerve ſomething from theſe two actions, the renting of his garments and the ſhaving of his head. Theſe referre to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his ſorrow for thoſe loſſes in eſtate and the death of his children: As the other two actions, his falling upon the ground and worſhipping referre to the expreſſion of that homage and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that he tendered up to God in the middeſt of theſe ſorrowes. From thoſe two acts of ſorrow learne we,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That when the hand of God is upon us, it becommeth us to be ſenſible of it, and to be humbled under it. Job</hi> hearing theſe ſad relations doth not ſtand out ſtoutly, as if nothing had touch'd him: but to ſhew that ſorrow did even rent his heart, he rent his garments, to ſhew that his affliction touch'd his ſpirit, he ſhav'd his head. There are two extreames that we are carefully to avoyd in times of affliction: and the Apoſtle doth caution all the ſonnes of God againſt them both in one verſe, Heb. 12.5. <hi>My ſonne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.</hi> Thoſe are the two extreames, <hi>despiſing and fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> when God doth correct. He would not have us deſpiſe his chaſtning, to ſay, I doe not regard this, let God take all if he will: If my eſtate muſt goe, let it goe; if my children die, let them die, this is a <hi>despiſing of the chaſtening of the Lord,</hi> and God cannot beare it, that we ſhould beare it thus lightly. There is another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, that is, <hi>fainting</hi>; If when goods are taken away, the heart be taken away, and when children die, then the ſpirit of the Parent dies too, <hi>this is fainting.</hi> Take heed of theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames. <hi>Job</hi> walkes in the middle, in the golden meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them both. He doth not careleſly deſpiſe, neither doth he unbeleevingly faint: he riſeth up and he rents his garments. He would have it knowne that he fainted not under the ſtroake, and he would have it knowne, that he felt the ſtroake, he was not like a ſtocke or a ſtone; he would not carry it with a ſtoicall apathy, but with Chriſtian fortitude and magnanimity. Senceleſſe ones are taxed, Jerem. 5.3. <hi>Thou haſt ſtriken them, and they have not grieved.</hi> Such are compared by <hi>Solomon to him that lyes downe in the midſt of the Sea, or as he that lyeth upon the top of a maſt,</hi> ſecure and careleſſe in the greateſt dangers. <hi>They have ſtricken me ſhalt thou ſay, and I was not ſicke, they have beaten me and I felt it not,</hi> Prov. 23.34, 35. The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> reproves the like. <hi>Strangers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have devoured his ſtrength and he knoweth it not, yea gray haires are here and there upon him and he knoweth
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98733:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it not,</hi> ca. 7.9. That is, he is in an afflicted, in a declining condition, and yet he layeth it not to heart. A man may out of the greatneſſe of his ſpirit (but not out of the careleſneſſe of his ſpirit) ſay as <hi>Luther</hi> once did, when things went very ill, <hi>If the world will goe thus, let it goe thus.</hi> Otherwiſe it is a moſt unbecomming temper to be ſtricken of God, and not to tremble, at leaſt to take it to heart. When God afflicteth us, then we ſhould afflict our ſelves and be humbled: when Gods hand is upon us, our hands (in this ſence) ſhould be upon our ſelves: We muſt beare our croſſe upon our backs, we muſt not make a fire of it to warme our hands. Indeed the Apoſtle exhorts to <hi>rejoyce in tribulation,</hi> and it is an excellent thing to rejoyce in tribulation, but we muſt not ſleight, much leſſe make a ſport of tribulation. Rejoycing ariſeth from a holy ſatisfaction that the ſoule hath in the dealings of God with us. But ſleighting ariſeth from an unholy contempt, or at the beſt from a ſtupid inſenſibleneſſe of Gods dealings with us. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hath in it the height of wickedneſſe, and the latter hath not the leaſt degree of goodneſſe, <hi>It is no vertue to beare what we doe not feele.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, obſerve</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in times of affliction we may expreſſe our ſorrowes by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gestures, by ſorrowfull geſtures. Iob</hi> was not only ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but he acts ſorrow, he puts himſelfe into mourning poſtures, he rents his garments, he ſhav's his head, downe he falleth upon the ground. It is no hypocriſie to appeare what we are: it is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie to appeare what we are not. We uſe to ſay, he mourneth truly that mourneth without a garment, but if a man mourne in truth, a mourning garment is comely. To mourn in our cloathes and laugh in our ſleeves, is both ſinfull and baſe. Now <hi>Iob</hi> mourned indeed, the ſhaving his head and renting his garment, was but to keepe an outward correſpondence with what he was within. Therefore take heed of cenſuring thoſe who in great ſorrowes uſe ſorrowfull geſtures, ſtriking upon their breaſts, tearing their haire or the like. Only let all take heed of exceſſive and immoderate mourning; mourne not like <hi>Rachell,</hi> who would receive no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, mourne not like the Heathen who had no hope.

               <p>
                  <hi>And worſhipped.</hi>] To vvorſhip is to give to any one <hi>the honour due unto him</hi>: So the rendering unto God that <hi>love,</hi> that <hi>feare,</hi> that <hi>ſervice,</hi> that <hi>honour</hi> vvhich is due unto him is the <hi>worſhipping of God,</hi> that's the Scripture definition, Pſal. 29.2. <hi>Give unto the Lord the honour due unto his name</hi>; then followes by vvay of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>Worſhip the Lord in the beauty of holineſſe,</hi> that is, <hi>in his holy Temple, in his beautifull Sanctuary,</hi> or <hi>in the comely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Sanctuary.</hi> So that <hi>worſhip</hi> is the tendering of honour to the Lord, in a vvay honourable to him, namely according to his own vvill and Lawes of vvorſhip: vvhich is intimated by comming to <hi>worſhip him in his beautifull Sanctuary,</hi> where all things about the ſervice of God vvere exactly preſcribed by God. And then there was <hi>beauty</hi> or <hi>comely honour</hi> in the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> vvhen all things vvere ordered there by the rule of his preſcription; varying and departing from vvhich vvould have filled that holy place vvith darkneſſe and deformity, notwithſtanding all the outward luſtre and beauty had bin preſerved.</p>
               <p>The worſhip of God is two-fold, there is <hi>internall worſhip</hi> and there is <hi>externall worſhip. Internall worſhip</hi> is to <hi>love God,</hi> to <hi>feare God,</hi> and to <hi>truſt upon him,</hi> theſe are acts of <hi>inward worſhip,</hi> theſe are the ſumme of our duty and Gods honour contained in the firſt Commandement: And ſo you may underſtand vvorſhip in the Text. <hi>Iob fell downe and worſhipped,</hi> that is, preſently upon thoſe reports hee put forth an act of love and holy feare, acts of dependance and holy truſt upon God, in his Spirit, ſaying to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect within himſelfe. Lord <hi>though all this be come upon me, yet I will not depart from thee, or deale falſly in thy Covenant. I know thou art ſtill the ſame</hi> Jehovah, <hi>true, holy, gracious, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, All-ſufficient; and therefore behold me proſtrate before thee, and reſolving, ſtill to love thee, ſtill to feare thee, ſtill to truſt thee, thou art my God ſtill and my portion for ever. Though I had nothing left in the world that I could call mine, yet thou Lord alone art enough, yet thou alone art All.</hi> Such doubtleſſe vvas the language of <hi>Iobs</hi> heart, and theſe were mighty actings of <hi>inward worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then likewiſe there is <hi>externall worſhip,</hi> which is the ſumme of the ſecond Commandement, and it is nothing elſe but the ſerving of the Lord according to his owne Ordinances and inſtitution, in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98733:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe ſeverall wayes wherein God will be honoured and ſerved, this is outward vvorſhip, and as we apply our ſelves unto them, ſo we are reckon'd to worſhip God. <hi>Job</hi> worſhipped God outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>falling to the ground,</hi> by <hi>powring out ſupplications,</hi> and by <hi>speaking good words of God</hi> (as we reade afterward) words ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne abaſement and the honour of God, clearely and fully acquitting and juſtifying the Lord in all thoſe works of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and diſpenſations towards him.</p>
               <p>This is worſhip both internall and externall. Internall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is the chiefe, but God requireth both: and there is a neceſſity of joyning both together, that God may have honour in the world. Internall worſhip is compleat in it ſelfe, and pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God without the externall: The externall may be compleat in it ſelfe, but is never pleaſing to God without the internall. Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall worſhip pleaſes God moſt, but externall honours God moſt: for by this God is knowne, and his glory held forth in the world. Externall worſhip is Gods name. Hence the Temple was called <hi>the place where God put his Name,</hi> ſc. <hi>his worſhip,</hi> by which <hi>God is knowne,</hi> as a <hi>man</hi> by his <hi>name, They that worſhip God muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in Sprit and in Truth: In Spirit,</hi> that is with inward love and feare, reverence and ſincerity. <hi>In Truth,</hi> that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true rule preſcribed in his word. Spirit reſpects the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward power, Truth the outward forme. The former ſtrikes at hypocriſie, the latter ſtrikes at Idolatry. The one oppoſes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of our heads, the other the looſeneſſe of our hearts in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>Obſerve further, that it is only ſaid, <hi>Job fell downe and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,</hi> nothing is ſaid of the object to whom he did direct his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or whom he did worſhip. The object is not expreſt but underſtood, or preſuppoſed; And indeed worſhip is a thing ſo proper and peculiar to God, that when we name worſhip, we muſt needs underſtand God. For nothing but God, or that which we make a god is or can be worſhipped. Either he is God whom we worſhip, or (as much as in us lies) we make him one. What creature ſo ever ſhares in this honour, this honour <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> ſets it up above, and makes it more then a creature.</p>
               <p>The very Heathens thought every thing below a God, below worſhip: therefore there needed not an expreſſion of the object; when the Text ſaith, <hi>Job worſhipped,</hi> that implyes his worſhip was directed unto God, yet there is a kind of worſhip which is due to creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:98733:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>There is a civill worſhip mentioned in Scripture, as well as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip. Civill worſhip may be given to men. And there is a two-fold civill worſhip (ſpoken of in Scripture) There is a <hi>civill worſhip of duty,</hi> and there is a <hi>civill worſhip of courteſie.</hi> That of duty is from inferiours to their ſuperiours, from children to their Parents, from ſervants to their Maſters, from Subjects to Kings and Magiſtrates. Theſe gods muſt have civill worſhip. As <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.11. vvhen <hi>Joſeph</hi> came into the preſence of <hi>Jacob</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>he bowed downe to the ground</hi>; this vvas a civill vvorſhip, and a vvorſhip of duty from an inferiour to a ſuperiour. And it is ſaid of the brethren of <hi>Judah, Gen.</hi> 49.8. when <hi>Jacob</hi> on his death-bed bleſſed the 12. Tribes, <hi>Thy brethren ſhall worſhip thee or bow downe to thee.</hi> It is the ſame vvord uſed here in this Text. <hi>Judahs</hi> honour vvas to vvield the Scepter, the <hi>government was laid upon his ſhoulders</hi>; now he being the chiefe Magiſtrate, all the reſt of the Tribes, all his brethren muſt vvorſhip him or give civill honour unto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is likewiſe <hi>a worſhip of courteſie,</hi> vvhich is from equals, when one equall vvill bow to another, or vvhen a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our (as ſometimes in courteſie he vvill) bowes downe or vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips his inferiour: As it is noted concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> that vvhen he came before the men of the Country of <hi>Heth,</hi> he <hi>bowed himſelfe</hi>;<note place="margin">Gen. 23.12.</note> Now <hi>Abraham</hi> vvas the <hi>Superiour,</hi> he vvas a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>Great-man,</hi> yet comming before the men of the Country, <hi>he bowed himſelfe,</hi> and it is the ſame vvord.</p>
               <p>So then this civill vvorſhip may lawfully be given unto men. But as for divine vvorſhip that is proper and peculiar unto God, that glory he vvill not give to graven Images, man or Angell, and therfore we muſt not. Hence vve find that vvhen <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did act their civill vvorſhip a little too farre, they vvere preſently taken oft for they ſhould intrench upon the divine vvorſhip. Civill vvorſhip vvhen it is exceſſive and goeth too farre is ſinfull; As in <hi>Act.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Luke</hi> relates that as ſoone as <hi>Peter</hi> came in, <hi>Cornelius met him and fell at his feet and worſhipped him</hi>; the vvorſhip vvas to <hi>Peter,</hi> for vve are not to thinke that <hi>Cornelius</hi> vvas ſo groſſely ignorant as to take <hi>Peter</hi> for a god, and to give him divine vvorſhip; but the meaning of it is, that he fell downe at his feet and gave him an honour and reſpect beyond vvhat he ought to have done, he vvas exceſſive in it: therefore <hi>Peter</hi> takes him off, <hi>Stand up</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I my ſelfe alſo am a man,</hi> I am a man as thou
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98733:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
art, though an Apoſtle give me ſuch reſpect as becommeth a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt, take heed that you give me no more than belongeth to a man. So the Angell, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.8. <hi>When</hi> John <hi>falleth downe at his feet and worſhippeth,</hi> he takes him up, <hi>See thou doe it not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for I am thy fellow ſervant:</hi> This is too much for man, <hi>worſhip God,</hi> as it is in the end of the verſe; ſuch worſhip belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth properly and peculiarly unto God.</p>
               <p>So much for the opening of theſe two latter actions of <hi>Job</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto God. We ſhall now give you ſome Obſervations.<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>He fell downe upon the ground and worſhipped.</hi> You ſee how <hi>Job</hi> divides himſelfe and his affections in this time of his affliction, part he beſtowed upon his children and ſervants, and loſſes, they ſhall have his ſorrow and teares, <hi>He rent his mantle and ſhaved his head,</hi> but they ſhall not have all: God ſhall have the better part, his love, his feare, his truſt, his body to bow to him, and his ſoule to worſhip him.</p>
               <p>Learne from hence, <hi>That a godly man will not let nature worke alone, he mixes and tempers acts of grace with acts of nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt not <hi>ſorrow as thoſe that are without hope</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) qualifie ſorrow with hope, theſe mixt do well. A man muſt not ſorrow for outward things, as though we had nothing els to do, but to ſorrow, he muſt remember he hath a God to worſhip and honour. <hi>Job</hi> beſtowes ſomewhat upon his children, but more upon his God; while his body fell to the earth, his heart was raiſed up to Heaven, <hi>He fell downe and worſhipped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That afflictions ſend the people of God home unto God; afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons draw a godly man nearer unto God</hi>; Then <hi>Job fell downe and worſhipped.</hi> Afflictions are a great advantage to the ſervants of God; for when the world frownes moſt, then they beg moſt for the ſmiles of God, when the world is ſtrange to them, and will not looke on them, then they get more familiarity and cloſer commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, they ſeeke his face. Wicked men in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in their ſorrowes, are either quite drowned in and overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with them, ſo that there is nothing but ſorrow, as we ſay all a mort; or elſe they goe out to helpe and relieve themſelves with worldly refreſhments; trouble drives them to ſinne, it may be as low as Hell to ſeeke reliefe. The more poore they are, the more wicked they are; <hi>ſuch are not poore as</hi> Job, <hi>though they are as poore as</hi> Job. <hi>Jobs</hi> poverty ſent him to God, rich in mercy. <hi>He fell down and worſhipped.</hi>

                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:98733:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thirdly learne,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the people of God turne all their afflictions into prayers or into praiſes.</hi> When God is ſtriking then <hi>Iob</hi> is praying, when God is afflicting, then <hi>Iob</hi> fals to worſhipping. <hi>Grace makes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very condition worke glory to God, as God makes every condition worke good to them who have grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Job <hi>falleth downe and worſhippeth,</hi> obſerve here,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it becommeth us to worſhip God in an humble manner.</hi> Though God (as we ſhewed before) may be worſhipped in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſture, yet we ſhould rather chooſe that poſture which is moſt humble, and may lay our bodies as low as our ſoules, if it may be. There were ſome lately amongſt us, who cry'd aloud, as great Patrons for humble poſtures in worſhip: and all were cenſured for a ſtiffe necke and an Elephants knee, who refuſed to bow with them, or to bow their way. I may well adde their way, for Gods way of bowing was neither queſtion'd nor refuſed; all their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in bowing went but one way, they muſt bow towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and towards the <hi>Altar</hi> at leaſt, if not to it. Some of their ſtomackes I beleeve would have digeſted that before this time, eſpecially being a little help'd with a diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We may here obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That divine worſhip it is Gods peculiar.</hi> Papiſts have worſhip for creatures, and they have a diſtinction for it, but no Scripture for it. They tell us of <hi>Latria,</hi> which is they ſay worſhip proper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, and their <hi>Dulia,</hi> which is for Saints, and then their <hi>Huper-dulia,</hi> which is for the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and for the ſigne of the Croſſe. Thus they make vain diſtinctions which God and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture make not. Vain diſtinctions are good enough to maintaine vaine ſuperſtitions. They that invent a worſhip, muſt invent a doctrine to maintaine it by. Some perhaps may ſtumble at that Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.9. where this promiſe is made to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, Behold I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan, which ſay they are Iewes and are not, but doe lie, behold I will make them to come and worſhip before thy feet, and to know that I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thee.</hi> May not worſhip then be given to a creature?</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. If this be divine worſhip, then worſhipping at the feet of the Church, notes worſhipping in the Church, not worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Church. The worſhip is not terminated in the Church, but in Chriſt; who dwels and rules in the Church, who is both Head and husband of the Church. Theſe enemies being convinc'd of the preſence of Chriſt in his Church ſhall worſhip him. This, <hi>David</hi> prophecies of Chriſt, ſpeaking in his owne perſon, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 18.43, 44. <hi>Thou haſt made me the head of the Heathen, a people vvhom I have not knowne ſhall ſerve me. As ſoone as they heare of me they ſhall obey me: the strangers ſhall ſubmit themſelves unto me.</hi> That of the Apoſtle will more illuſtrate this ſence, who ſpeaking of the great benefit of prophecying in a knowne tongue, concludes his Diſcourſe thus, <hi>If all prophecy and there come in one that beleeveth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all. And thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt, and ſo falling downe on his face, he vvill</hi> WORSHIP <hi>God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</hi> The worſhip then is not given to the Church, but to God, who in ſuch ordinances, or other acts of his power and goodneſſe is evidently revealed as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Church.</p>
               <p>So much for the actions or geſtures of <hi>Iob,</hi> what he did? <hi>He rent his mantle and ſhaved his head, and fell downe upon the ground and worſhipped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we come to his words, to that which <hi>Iob</hi> ſpake in the two laſt verſes.</p>

               <p>Words are or ought to be the Interpreters of the heart, and the Comment of our actions. This ſpeech of <hi>Iob</hi> doth indeed inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret his heart and expound the meaning of his former actions. This ſpeech (I ſay) of <hi>Iob</hi> is the true Comment of his owne actions; for ſome ſeeing <hi>Iob renting his garments</hi> and <hi>ſhaving his head,</hi> and <hi>caſting himſelfe downe upon the ground,</hi> they might not know the meaning of all this, they could not reade his heart in theſe ſtrange behaviours, they might not underſtand what his intentions were, probably they might judge that he was enraged and madde, that he was diſtracted or drunke with ſorrow: that he was either
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98733:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deſperate or impatient, at the report of thoſe loſſes. Therfore now to confute all ſuch ſurmizes, he ſpeaks forth, <hi>the words of truth and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernes.</hi> And by that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he ſaith, ſets ſo fair and true a gloſſe upon his actions, as might then render them, not only rationall and ingenuous, but holy and gracious in the eyes of all men, as they were before in the eyes of God, who knew his heart. Satan was now, like the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> before <hi>Ahab,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 20.23.</note> watching for words, he had done his buſineſſe and now he was trying how it would worke, what the event and iſſue would be; he harken'd when ſome irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſpeech ſhould come from the mouth of <hi>Iob,</hi> he looked preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he ſhould blaſpheme God: he could not but ſmile ſurely, when he ſaw him renting his garments and ſhaving his head and falling downe on the ground, O now it workes, I ſhall heare him blaſpheme and curſe God preſently. He that is thus diſtempered in the carriage of the other members of his body, will not ſurely be able long to rule (that unruly peace) his tongue. One undutifull or diſhonourable word caſt upon God, would have beene muſicke to Satans eare and joy to his heart. He would have catch'd it up as nimbly as the men before ſpoken of, did, <hi>brother Benhadad</hi> from the mouth of <hi>Ahab.</hi> But how blanke look'd Satan, how was he cloathed with ſhame at the fall of thoſe words from <hi>Iob, Naked came I out of,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What <hi>David</hi> ſpake concerning the words of his enemies (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.21. <hi>Their words were ſmoother then butter, but warre was in their heart, they were ſweeter then honey and ſofter then oyle, yet were they drawne ſwords</hi>) vve may ſpeake of theſe words of <hi>Iob</hi> conſidered in reference to Satan, and in reference unto God. Theſe words of <hi>Iob</hi> in reference unto God were as ſweet as hony, as ſmooth as butter. For this breath had nothing in it, but meeknes and patience, humility and holineſſe, in all which God delights: but in reference unto Satan they were as drawne Swords, as poyſon'd ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, Satan was hardly ever ſo ſmitten before, as he was by theſe words of <hi>Iob.</hi> There is no word in this ſentence, but gave Satan the lye, and refuted all his ſlander. And in the cloſe <hi>Iob</hi> gives him the deepeſt ſtabbe of all, It was a dagger at the very heart of the devill, when he heard him ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> No words could be utter'd upon the longeſt ſtudy, more croſſe to Satans expectation, or more anſwerable to the former te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of God; and therefore the Lord crownes all, both his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and his ſpeeches with a new teſtimony, <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98733:104"/>
nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much of <hi>Jobs</hi> words in generall, I ſhall now examine them diſtinctly in the parts.</p>
               <p>Some conceive that <hi>Job</hi> at that time ſpake out his mind more largely,<note place="margin">Beza. <hi>in loc.</hi>
                  </note> but that the Holy Ghoſt in the penning of this Story did gather and ſumme up the ſtrength of all his ſpeech into theſe two concluſions.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thither.</p>

               </q>
               <p>We will conſider the words a little firſt in the Grammaticall ſenſe of them, and then we will conſider the reaſon of them: For here they are uſed logically as a ſtrong and mighty argument, both for the ſupporting of his owne ſpirit under thoſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and for the juſtifying and acquitting God in ſo afflicting him.</p>
               <q>Naked came I out of my Mothers wombe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Naked.</hi>] There is a two-fold nakedneſſe, there is an internall nakedneſſe, and there is an externall nakedneſſe: There is a naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſoule as well as of the body. The nakedneſſe of the ſoule is, when it is deveſted of all it's gracious ornaments and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments. When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked ſhall I returne thither,</hi> it referreth eſpecially to the nakedneſſe of the body; for though it be a truth that <hi>Job</hi> came naked into the world in regard of his ſoule, yet he knew he ſhould not goe naked out of the world, in regard of his ſoule. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then he referreth nakedneſſe to his going out of the world as well as to his comming in, therefore it cannot be here meant of an inward nakedneſſe, his ſoule came naked in, but he knew his ſoule ſhould go out cloathed. Neither can it be meant of a then preſent ſpirituall nakedneſſe; for <hi>Job</hi> was never ſo richly and gorgeouſly attired in his ſoule, never appeared in ſuch glorious ornaments of grace, as when he was ſtript of all worldly comforts. Therfore the nakedneſſe here is bodily nakedneſſe, that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.25. deſcribing our firſt Parents, <hi>They were both naked,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the man and his wife, and they were not aſhamed.</hi> Yet that nakedneſſe and this which <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes of (though they were
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98733:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both bodily and externall) were very different and unlike: for that nakedneſſe of Creation needed no covering, nakedneſſe was then an ornament. Man was richly attired when he had no garments. The nakedneſſe of creation was the abſence of cloathing, or a not uſing of cloathes, it was not the want of cloathing. But the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of, is the nakednes after the fall properly, where nakedneſſe importeth not only a not having of cloaths, but want of cloathing; and ſo nakedneſſe is a part of that curſe and puniſhment which followed ſin. <hi>Naked came I out of my mothers wombe,</hi> that is, <hi>I came into the world in a ſad and miſerable condition, weake and poore</hi>: And ſo nakedneſſe is put not ſtrictly as oppoſed onely to cloathing, but we may take it more largely for the want of all outward comforts whatſoever, <hi>I came a poore deſtitute creature into the world, I had not onely no cloathing upon my backe, but I had no comfort for my body, I brought neither Sheepe nor Oxen, nor children nor ſervants into the world with me, I had none of theſe things, nothing to helpe me of my owne, when I firſt ſet foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the world.</hi>

               <p>Some Naturaliſts conſidering this kind of nakedneſſe, have fallen out into great complaints againſt nature, or indeed rather againſt the God of nature, as <hi>Pliny</hi> in the Preface to his 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> booke of his naturall Hiſtory, doth as it were chide with nature for turning man into the world in ſuch a helpeleſſe forlorne condition, as if man were dealt with more hardly then any other creature, then any beaſts of the field or foules of the aire.

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>neſſe came into the world: And this he ſpake, not obſerving as he might, how many wayes God hath provided for the helpe and ſupply of that nakedneſſe; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man underſtanding and reaſon in ſtead of weapons and cloathes, which alſo are a meanes for the procuring of all things neceſſary for the ſupporting of that naked and weake periſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <q>Naked ſhall I returne thither.</q>
               <p>The difficulty that is in this lyeth onely in that word <hi>Thither</hi>;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98733:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the doubt is, what place he meanes or whither? What into my mothers wombe? There is no ſuch returne, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note>
                  <hi>Shall a man that is old goe into his mothers wombe and be borne againe?</hi> Some anſwer it thus, The Adverbe [<hi>thither</hi>] doth not neceſſarily referre to the literall antecedent; but in Scripture ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Relatives referre to ſomewhat in the mind or in the thought of the ſpeaker, and not to that which was before ſpoken by him; as that of <hi>Mary</hi> ſheweth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.15. when ſhe commeth into the garden and findes that Chriſt was riſen, <hi>ſhe meeteth Chriſt and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him to be the Gardiner,</hi> ſaith unto him, <hi>Sir if you have borne him hence, Him, what him?</hi> There was no antecedent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to which <hi>Him</hi> ſhould relate, only <hi>Maries</hi> mind was ſo full of Chriſt, that ſhe thought every one would underſtand, <hi>what him, or whom</hi> ſhe ſpake of: as if none could ſpeake of or thinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but of Chriſt only. Therefore ſhe made the relation to that which was in her owne ſpirit, and not to what was formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. So ſome Interpreters make the [<hi>thither</hi>] to be God or the grave, <hi>I ſhall returne unto God, or I ſhall return to the grave, to the houſe of the grave,</hi> as the Chaldee paraphraſe hath it. For they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Job</hi> had his mind full of thoſe thoughts, therfore he may make a relation to that.</p>
               <p>Another conſideration for the clearing of it is this, that ſuch Adverbes of place as this is, doe not only ſignifie place,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall collect ſome Obſervations from them two wayes. Firſt as they containe a generall truth. 2. As they are an argument or a reaſon for the ſupport of a man in ſuch a ſad condition as <hi>Job</hi> was then reduced unto. In the former way obſerve,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That every man is borne a poore, helpeleſſe, naked crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> The ſoule is naked of all that is good, there is not a rag of grace upon it, when we come into the world. Our bodies are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked too, ſo that we are borne with nothing upon us, but only an ugly dreſſe of ſinne, ſuch as may juſtly make God loath us, and us a terrour to our ſelves. <hi>Naked came I into the world</hi>; this one thought well taken in and fully digeſted, will lay pride in the duſt; this thought that we were borne thus naked, will ſtrip us of all high and proud thoughts of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Naked ſhall I returne.</hi> Note,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When death commeth it ſhakes us out of all our worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and poſſeſſions.</hi> Death is called an uncloathing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>We that are in this Tabernacle doe groane, being burdened, not for that we would be uncloathed,</hi> that is, <hi>not that we would die.</hi> Death is called an <hi>uncloathing,</hi> becauſe it pulleth all outward things off from a man, it pulleth off all his raiment, his riches, his lands, his honours, yea death uncloathes the very bones, our fleſh weares off quickely in the grave. Wee have a uſuall phraſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98733:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
us, and it is a very proper one: when a rich man dies (we ſay) <hi>he left a great eſtate,</hi> he leaves it indeed, for he cannot carry it with him, he muſt goe out naked, how well cloathed ſo ever he was while he was here. The Apoſtle doth more then intimate, that ſome rich men do ſcarce beleeve this for ſound doctrine; he ſpeaks as if he would beat them off from ſome thought of carrying the world with them out of the world; while they live they are buried in their riches, and when they die, they hope their riches will be buried with them, yea and riſe with them againe. Such a conceit (I ſay) the Apoſtle ſeemes to meet with, for in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. having ſaid, <hi>We brought nothing with us into this world,</hi> he addeth in the next words, <hi>and it is certaine we can carry nothing out</hi>; he doth not ſay, <hi>we brought nothing into the world, and we can carry nothing out,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> here ſpeakes, but as if <hi>Jobs</hi> aſſertion had come into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, he ſaith, <hi>we brought nothing into this world, and it is certaine,</hi> never doubt of the truth of it, <hi>we can carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out,</hi> we ſhall goe out as we came-in. <hi>Many,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> ſpeakes, Chap. 2.6. <hi>lade themſelves with thick clay.</hi> But as the queſtion there followes. <hi>How long?</hi> This <hi>lading</hi> muſt be laid downe againe. If riches end not before thee, as thine, they muſt end with thee. Yet if any would carry riches and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of the world, it will be their wiſdome to labour for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall riches, for ſpirituall cloathing, when ſuch die, as they ſhall not be found naked, ſo they ſhall not goe out naked: All your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloathing and riches muſt be left on this ſide the grave, but get ſpirituall cloathing and riches, and you ſhall goe out of the world adorn'd and enrich'd for ever, the cloathing of grace, the robe of righteouſneſſe, a veſture of ſpirituall ornaments will endure to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly note here further, how the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> deſcribes the life of man, <hi>Naked came I into the world, and naked ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The life of man it is nothing elſe but a comming and a returning</hi>; Here is nothing ſaid of ſtaying or abiding; <hi>We have here no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing City,</hi> while we are here, we can hardly be ſaid to continue here, and after a few dayes we ſhall not be here at all. It is but a comming and a going, it is but a flood and an ebbe, and then we are carried into the <hi>Ocean of eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may yet conſider the words as they are an argument (and ſo I ſhall note two things from them.) So <hi>Job</hi> uſes them as an
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98733:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
argument both to ſupport himſelfe and to acquit God. Then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That a godly man in his ſtraights ſtudieth arguments to acquit and juſtifie God in all his dealings with him. Job</hi> could not have found out upon longeſt ſtudy a better or a ſtronger argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the acquitting of God then this is, I have as much as I brought, then what wrong is done me in all this. As wicked men when they fall into ſtraits or troubles, eſpecially when they fall into ſin, ſtudy arguments how to ſhift themſelves out and lay all the blame upon God; as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> our firſt Parents in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe (there it began) when they had ſinned and were naked, they began to deviſe ſhifts how to put it from themſelves and to faſten the fault upon God. <hi>David</hi> on the other ſide labours as much to cleare God, if ever he ſhould be ſtript naked, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 51.4. <hi>I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſinne, that thou mayeſt be juſtified when thou speakest and cleare when thou judgeſt.</hi> Weigh the reaſon why <hi>David</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth his ſinne in that <hi>Pſalme,</hi> I doe it ſaith he, that I may by this meanes acquit God, whatſoever God ſhall doe with me hereafter, whatſoever affliction God ſhall bring upon me; men it may be will begin to judge G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d for it, and to ſay that he hath dealt hardly with me, notice having been taken, what an eminent ſervant of God I have been, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I confeſſe my ſinne before thee that thou maiſt be cleare when thou judgeſt,</hi> or as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> quotes the place, according to the Septuagint, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. <hi>That thou mightest overcome when thou art judged. David</hi> knew men would be apt to judge God, if they ſaw him afflicted, and therefore to ſtop their mouthes, or to give God the day againſt them, he confeſſes his ſin, thereby ſhewing cauſe why God might chaſtiſe him, either for correction of ſin paſt, or prevention of ſin to come.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the argument referreth unto <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe, we may obſerve this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the conſideration of what we once were, and of what at laſt we muſt be, may releeve our spirits in the greateſt outward afflictions of this life.</hi> Art thou for the preſent in a naked conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Conſider thou waſt naked once, and ere long ſhalt be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked againe: Conſider the two extreames, the beginning and the ending, and that will beare thee up in the middle condition. There is many a man that complaines and ſaith, I have nothing but the cloathes upon my backe left me, and they are but raggs, but meane
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98733:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ones neither: Why! With nothing but the cloathes upon thy backe? Know O man thou waſt borne with nothing but thy skin upon thy backe. Conſider this, and leave complaining; this was one thought which helped <hi>Job</hi> to beare this burden, the want of all. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth this argument to the very ſame purpoſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. having ſaid, <hi>That godlineſſe with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is great gaine,</hi> he ſubjoynes preſently this argument of <hi>Job,</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>we brought nothing into this world, and it is certaine we ſhall carry nothing out</hi>; To conſider what (not long agoe) we were, and what very ſhortly we muſt be, will mightily work the ſoule to contentation in what eſtate ſoever wee are. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
               <q>The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away.</q>
               <p>This is the ſecond argument which <hi>Job</hi> uſeth to both the former purpoſes; and it is a more ſpirituall and ſublime argument than the former. A man who hath nothing in him but nature, may ſay as much as <hi>Job</hi> did before, though he could never ſay it with <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for though godly perſons uſe naturall arguments and common reaſons, yet being concocted in their ſpirits, they become heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpirituall. Naturall men (I ſay) or Heathens have taken up ſuch an argument as that,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Scio me morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem genuiſſe.</hi>
                  </note> as when word was brought to a Heathen Philoſopher, that his ſonne was dead, <hi>I knew</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I begot a ſonne mortall, and ſubject to death</hi>; he did but look backe to the common condition of man and ſupported himſelfe. But now I ſay this ſecond argument is higher, it is not an argument bottomed upon the frailty of nature, but upon the ſoveraignty of God; This argument is grounded upon the equity of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and diſpenſations: <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath given and the Lord hath taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>The Lord hath given.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,</hi> Jam. 1.17. What gifts doth <hi>Job</hi> here meane? He meanes good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gifts in their kind; but not the beſt and moſt perfect kind of gifts. The Lord once gave me thoſe Oxen, thoſe Sheepe, all theſe outward things that now I am ſtripped of, <hi>The Lord hath given</hi>; A gift is any good freely beſtowed; when we receive a thing, which another was not ingaged to beſtow, that is a gift. Now God doth not onely give us thoſe tranſcendents, grace and glory,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98733:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
faith in Chriſt here and full fruition of Chriſt hereafter: not onely are theſe gifts, I ſay, ſent in from God and undeſerved by us; but outward things, riches and honour, children and ſervants, houſes and lands, theſe are the gifts of God likewiſe; we have not the leaſt creature-comfort of our owne we have, nothing of our owne but ſinne. <hi>What haſt thou, that thou haſt not received?</hi> is a truth concerning every thing, we have even to a hoofe or a ſhoe-latchet. Wee are indebted unto God for our ſpiritualls, for our temporals, for all. We muſt ſay of all, little or much, great or ſmall, <hi>The Lord hath given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How did the Lord give <hi>Job</hi> all his riches and eſtate?</p>
               <p>The Lord doth give either immediately or mediately. When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Lord hath given,</hi> we are not to underſtand it, as if the Lord had brought ſuch a preſent to him and ſaid, here take this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, take theſe cattell, theſe ſervants; but God gave them me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by bleſſing the labours of <hi>Job.</hi> So when the Lord proſpereth us in our honeſt endeavours and labours and callings, then the Lord giveth us outward things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord hath given. Job</hi> doth not ſay, by my ſtrength and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, by my policy and pradence, I have got this eſtate; as the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſaid, Iſa. 10.13. <hi>by the ſtrength of my hand have I done this, and by my wiſdome, for I am prudent. Iob</hi> takes no notice of himſelf, he was not idle, yet he ſpeaks as if he had done nothing, <hi>the Lord hath given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſhould teach us in the firſt place to acknowledge the Lord as the fountain and donor of all our outward comforts. When you get wealth, doe not ſay, this I have gotten (ſuch language is barbarous in divinity) but ſay, this <hi>the Lord hath given.</hi> Wee find an expreſſe caution to this purpoſe, given by <hi>Moſes</hi> from God, not onely againſt the former language of the tongue, but of the heart, When the Jewes ſhould come to <hi>Canaan</hi> and ſhould grow rich and great there. <hi>When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou ſhalt bleſſe the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 8.10, 11.17.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Beware thou forget not the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee, and ſay in thy heart, my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth, but thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is hee that giveth thee power to get wealth: It is he that giveth thee power.</hi> Many who are perſwaded that God gives them grace, that God gives Heaven and Salvation, are hardly perſwaded, or at leaſt doe not ſo well conſider it, that God gives riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98733:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their hearts are yet ready to ſay, that they have gotten this wealth, they have gotten this honour. It is a ſweet thing, when a man lookes upward for theſe lower things, and can ſay on good grounds that his earth hath dropt down to him from Heaven. <hi>The Lord hath given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Lord hath given,</hi> it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his owne juſtice and equity in getting; <hi>Job</hi> did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich himſelfe by wrong, <hi>by grinding the faces of the poore.</hi> If he had done ſo, he could not have ſaid, <hi>the Lord hath given. So much as we get honestly, we may looke upon as a fruit of Gods bounty.</hi> Looke into your eſtates and whatſoever you have got by wrong dealing, take heed of ſaying, this is of <hi>Gods giving,</hi> for ſo you make God himſelfe a partner in your ſinnes. God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time gives when we uſe no meanes, but he never gives, when we uſe unlawfull meanes. What God ſaid concerning the ſetting-up of thoſe Kings, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.4. <hi>They have ſet-up Kings, but not by me,</hi> he ſaith of all, who enrich themſelves by wrong, <hi>they have gotten riches but not by me.</hi> When men leave the rule of juſtice, God leaves them. And though unlawfull acts are under the influence of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Wicked men thrive often, but they are never bleſſed; <hi>their prosperity is their curſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is obſervable, that when <hi>Job</hi> would ſupport himſelfe in the loſſe of his eſtate, he cals to mind how he came by his eſtate; and finding it all given in by the bleſſing of God upon his honeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and endeavours, he is ſatisfied. Note,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That what we get honeſtly, that we can part with contentedly.</hi> He that hath got his eſtate by injuſtice, can never leave it with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Honeſty in getting cauſeth quietneſſe of ſpirit in looſing outward things. Keepe a good conſcience in getting the world, and you ſhall have peace when you cannot keepe the world. Wheras a wrong-doer and a wrong-dealer, is in ſuch a day under a double affliction, he is afflicted with his preſent loſſe, and he ought to be afflicted for his former gaine.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Theſe words, <hi>the Lord hath given,</hi> being rightly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, will be as a Sword to cut-off foure monſters or monſtrous luſts, which annoy all the world, or as a medicine to cure foure diſeaſes about worldly things. Two of theſe luſts are ſtrongeſt in the rich: and the other paire aſſault the poore. The poore pine either with diſcontent, becauſe they have ſo little; or with envy, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98733:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have ſo much. The rich ſwell with pride, becauſe they have aboundance, or they are fil'd with contempt of thoſe that are in want. Let the rich ſeriouſly weigh this ſpeech, it will cure them of pride. <hi>Charge them that are rich</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 Tim. 6.17.) <hi>that they be not high-minded.</hi> You ſee how ſubject rich men are to this inflammation of pride. But with what doth he pricke this bladder? It is with this thought that God gives all riches, <hi>Let them truſt in the living God, who giveth us all things richly to enjoy.</hi> That argument of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 4.7. <hi>If thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, why doſt thou boaſt?</hi> is as ſtrong and as true in regard of temporals, as of ſpirituals. Conſider ſeriouſly that your eſtates are the gift of God, and downe fals pride. If you come honeſtly by them, they are the gift of God: If you come diſhoneſtly by them, they are the gifts of Satan, and you ought to be aſhamed of them and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them, not to boaſt or be proud of them.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, it will cure the rich of all contempt of others; what the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> obſerved and cenſured in the rich of thoſe times, is found by too much experience among the rich at this day, <hi>Yee have despiſed the poore,</hi> Chap. 2.6. Conſider it is the Lord, who gave, and he gave as a Lord freely, he might have given thine eſtate to that poore man, and have left thee in that condition, thou ſo much deſpiſeſt in thy brother. God gave him as much as his wiſdome thought fit; and it ſeemes he hath given thee more then thou art fit for. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> deſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing him, thou doeſt aſperſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God, and whileſt thou woundeſt him in his poverty, thou woundeſt God in his providence. Conſider it is the Lord that gives, and then be unconvinc'd, if you can, that while you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne man in his wants, you queſtion God in his wiſdome, buſie thy ſelfe hereafter in praiſing him who gives All, and leave deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, who hath received leſſe.</p>
               <p>Then likewiſe let the poore looke upon this Text, and it will cure them of two diſeaſes, into which they often fall, and by which they are much endanger'd, even in the vitals of grace, diſcontent and envy. <hi>It is the Lord that giveth,</hi> that ſhapes and cuts out your condition, why then ſhould you not be contented with his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and be thankfull in your lot? If your eſtates be proportioned from above, you ought to be content with your portion. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or in advertency from whom we receive, cauſeth murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at what we have. Doe not thinke thou haſt love from God, becauſe thou haſt a leſſe allowance from God. The power of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98733:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God is as much acted in making a Fly, as in making an Elephant; and his love may be as much, and is often more acted in giving a penny, then in giving a talent. Know this, thou who art a child of God, if thy portion be but a penny, it hath upon it the Image and Superſcription, a Fathers love, which is better then life.</p>
               <p>This alſo will cure the poore of envy; many times the poore have an evill eye of envy at the rich, they cannot beare it, that others have ſo much and they ſo little: Conſider it is the <hi>Lord that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi> This argument Chriſt uſeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.20. to him that was angry that they who came at the latter end of the day had as much as he, <hi>May not I doe with mine owne what I will? Is thine eye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, becauſe mine is good?</hi> The envious eye is an evill eye, envy is the diſeaſe of the eyes. This Text is one of the beſt medicines that ever was preſcribed. Wilt thou be ſicke, becauſe another is in health, and make thy brothers happineſſe the ground of thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie? Doe not thinke that all is loſt, which is not caſt into thy lapp; or that thy eſtate is leſſe or worſe, becauſe thou ſeeſt one having a greater or a better. Muſt God aske thee leave, or aske thy councell, how and in what meaſure to diſtribute his favours. Were all but well catechiſed in this one principle, that <hi>God gives all,</hi> it would ſoone diſpell this malignant vapour, and all would reſt ſatisfied, not becauſe they or others have received thus or thus; but becauſe God hath thus <hi>dispoſed to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve one thing more,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Lord gives us all, then we ſhould be willing to give back ſomewhat unto the Lord againe.</hi> And this conſideration that God gives us will make us willing to give unto God. What is the reaſon that many are ſo unwilling to give ſomewhat unto God? It is becauſe they will not underſtand that they are beholding to God for all. If they were perſwaded of their receipts from him, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Oratory might perſwade a gift from them, in the cauſe of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when God intreates them, who may of right command them; when he is content even to take it as a courteſie, who may ſend for it by authority, and expect it as a duty. God himſelfe, who fills and enjoyes all things, hath ſometimes (in a ſence) need of your eſtates. Chriſt who is Lord of Heaven and Earth is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in want of a penny. Chriſt tels you of his wants and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. and ſhewes how and when he is releeved. And as Chriſt wants in a member, ſome particular beleever; So he often wants in his whole body, which is the Church or whole company
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98733:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of beleevers. If you have any ſpirituall wiſdome to diſcerne times and ſeaſons, you may know, that now <hi>Chriſt wants mony</hi> (as I have explain'd.) Now God (in his cauſe) hath need. He goes about (in thoſe who ſolicit his cauſe) and askes a reliefe at every one of your doores. Now then doe but conſider, when any thing is asked for the Lords ſake, that <hi>the Lord gave all,</hi> this will be a key to unlocke your cheſts; this will at once untie your hearts and your purſes. Will you let Chriſt want, ſhall the cauſe of God want, while you have it, whereas what you have, <hi>God gave?</hi> It is expreſſe concerning <hi>Nabal,</hi> that this was the reaſon why he would not part with a loafe of bread to relieve <hi>David</hi> and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, 1 Sam. 25.11. <hi>Shall I take my bread and my water, and my fleſh that I have killed for my ſhearers, and ſend them to a fellow I know not who?</hi> You ſee the man was all in his poſſeſſives, <hi>my bread,</hi> and <hi>my water,</hi> and <hi>my fleſh,</hi> he never thought that God had any ſhare or intereſt in his eſtate, that God gave it, therefore he would not give to a ſervant of God. You ſhall ſee on the other hand, how <hi>Davids</hi> munificence and that of the Nobles with him, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 29. ſprung from this root, the acknowledgement that nothing was their owne, it came in all from God; when they had offered ſo willingly and bountifully towards the building of the Temple, <hi>David</hi> ſhewes the mine which yeelded ſo much treaſure, even this we have digged in all this while, <hi>All things come of thee, and of thine owne we have given thee,</hi> verſ. 15. They confeſſed that all came of God, they were but Stewards, he was the Owner, and his owne they could not with-hold from him. God giveth us the uſe of the creature, but he keepeth the right to them in his owne hand, when we have the poſſeſſion of them he hath the property. Wherefore let the conſideration that God giveth all make us ready and open handed to give unto God, when he calleth and requireth it at our hands.</p>
               <q>And the Lord hath taken away.</q>
               <p>When God gives it is an act of bounty, and when he takes it is an act of juſtice, for he is Lord, ſoveraigne Lord in both. But why doth <hi>Job</hi> here charge this upon God, <hi>The Lord hath taken?</hi> Was it not told him by the meſſengers, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans</hi> came and tooke away his cattell, plundered and pillaged his eſtate? They told him that <hi>the fire conſumed his Sheepe,</hi> and the <hi>wind blew downe the houſe upon his children</hi>: Why doth <hi>Iob</hi> ſay, <hi>The Lord
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98733:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath taken?</hi> What? will <hi>Job</hi> charge all thoſe robberies upon God himſelfe? Doth not this looke like the blaſphemy that the devill hoped would come out of <hi>Jobs</hi> mouth?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Lord hath taken,</hi> it doth but ſet forth the ſupreame power and ſoveraignty of God in ordering all things; and (as we opened before) that God gave the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Satan, or leave to ſpoyle him, or elſe Satan could not have touched one of the dogs of his Flocke. <hi>Job</hi> knew that God had all men and devils, fire and wind, all creatures in his hand. He ſaith, <hi>the Lord hath taken,</hi> becauſe none could take but by the will of God, and he was ſatisfied, that God willed that in righteouſneſſe and in judgement, which they acted with ſo much cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. <hi>Is there any evill in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Amos 3.6. Every evill of affliction or of trouble is ſaid to be the Lords doing, becauſe it cannot be done without the Lord. Wicked men in all their plots, and in all their ſucceſſes, are either the rod of God, to chaſten his people for their ſins, or elſe they are as Gods fornace to try his peoples graces, and purge them from their ſins. Thus the hand of the Lord is in all our ſorrows, <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, hath taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhould from hence learne,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In all our afflictions to looke beyond the creature.</hi> In all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils we either feele or feare, let our hearts be carried up unto God. As then we rightly enjoy outward bleſſings, when thoſe bleſſings carry us up unto God, when upon creatures our hearts are raiſed up to Heaven: So then we make a right uſe of afflictions, of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and troubles, when we are led by croſſes (in our meditations) unto God. <hi>Job</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>the Lord hath given and the</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans <hi>have taken away, the Lord hath enrich'd me, and Satan hath robb'd me,</hi> but as if he had never heard any mention of Satan or <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> of fire or winde, he ſaith, <hi>the Lord hath given and the Lord hath taken.</hi> He doth not fall out with man or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the devill, he is not angry with chance or fortune, with ſtarres or conſtellations; many in the troubleſome evils which they ſuffer are apt to fly out upon all creatures and upon all cauſes, rather then to caſt an eye upon God: whereas indeed we ſhould not take either good or evill out of the hand of any creature. There were ſome of old, <hi>Marcion</hi> and his followers, who could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this Doctrine, nor endure that we ſhould carry our evils, and lay them before Gods doore, and ſay, <hi>the Lord hath done this</hi>;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98733:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Therefore they found out two beginnings, that is two Gods rather then they would make the ſame God the authour of ſuch extreames (as they thought) of good and evill: They ſaid, <hi>There was one God that was a good God, and another an evill God; the one a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, the other a taking God; the one a loving God, a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God, the other an angry God, a ſevere God.</hi> Many of the Heathen taught better divinity then thoſe Heretikes. For they feyned that their <hi>Jupiter,</hi> had two great veſſels, placed at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of his <hi>Pallace,</hi> whereof the one was filled with <hi>Good,</hi> and the other with <hi>Evill.</hi> Theſe he diſpenced according to the dictate of his owne will among the ſons of men. And they painted <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> in two <hi>formes,</hi> with two <hi>faces</hi> of <hi>contrary colours,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>white,</hi> the hindermoſt <hi>blacke,</hi> to ſignifie that <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evill,</hi> which they ſhadow'd under <hi>white</hi> and <hi>blacke,</hi> came both from <hi>goddeſſe Fortune:</hi> which comes neare that language in the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.7. <hi>I forme the light and create darkeneſſe, I make peace and create evill.</hi> And we are taught to looke upon the ſame God, as the ſpring and fountaine of all good, and of all this ſort of evill. Though it be a truth (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) that <hi>the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cannot ſend forth bitter water and ſweet,</hi> take it in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or morall ſenſe, yet the ſame <hi>fountaine</hi> may ſend forth <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>ſweet,</hi> take it in a civill ſenſe,; that is, the ſame may be the authour of outward <hi>corrections</hi> and of outward <hi>favours.</hi> God is not the fountaine of <hi>good</hi> and of <hi>evill</hi> in a morall ſenſe, ſo nothing but good floweth from him: but take it in a civill ſenſe, and ſo both good and evill, bitter and ſweet come from the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
               <p>Conſider the words as they are an argument, and then ſee their ſtrength to the purpoſes, for which <hi>Job</hi> doth eſpecially here apply them; Firſt, the acquitting or juſtifying of God. 2. The ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and comforting of himſelfe: and ſo wee may note from them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the abſolute ſoveraignty of the Lord over us is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to acquit him from doing us any wrong, whatſoever he doth with us. Job</hi> ſaith only this, <hi>The Lord hath given and the Lord hath fallen</hi>; He is the ſoveraigne Lord, therefore I have no reaſon to complaine; he doth it, upon whom I have laid no ingagement, upon whom I have no tie at all, to doe this or that for me; he doth it who may reſolve the reaſon of all his actions into his owne will, <hi>he is the Lord.</hi> God cannot injure his creature; therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle

hath recourſe to that onely in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> for the anſwer of all cavils and objections againſt Gods dealing with man, <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the clay?</hi> The ſoveraignty and ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the Lord is enough to beare him out whatſoever he doth with, or to his creatures. <hi>O man, who art thou that replieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then againe, it is as ſtrong for the ſecond end, for the ſupport of the ſoule in bearing evill, conſider that it is <hi>the Lord that giveth and the Lord that takes.</hi> The thought of Gods ſoveraignty over us and over ours, may quiet our ſpirits in all that he doth unto us or ours. As it doth juſtifie God, ſo it ſhould quiet us: heare <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 39 9. <hi>I was dumbe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and opened not my mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou diddeſt it</hi>: he doth not ſay, I was contented becauſe thou dealeſt thus and thus with me, <hi>but I was dumbe, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou diddeſt it,</hi> that it was the act of God, the ſoveraigne Lord ſatisfied him, he had not a word to ſay, becauſe God did it. So <hi>Job</hi> here, <hi>The Lord hath taken away,</hi> is as if he had ſaid, I could not have borne this at the hands of any creature, but at the hands of my ſoveraigne Lord that may diſpoſe of me and mine, and doe what he pleaſeth, at his hands I not only beare it, but take it well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph</hi> had not a word of diſcontent to vent againſt his brethren, being thus reſolved, <hi>It was not you that ſent me hither but God, Gen.</hi> 45. And <hi>David</hi> layes aſide all revenge againſt rayling <hi>Shimei</hi> on this ground, <hi>So let him curſe, becauſe the Lord hath ſaid unto him, curſe David,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.10. A godly man cannot be angry at the doing or ſpeaking of that, which pleaſeth God, that it ſhould be done or ſpoken. And it takes away all complaining, <hi>that the Lord hath taken away.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>] The Name of God in Scripture is taken; firſt for God himſelfe. The name of a thing it is put for the thing named, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.5. <hi>Through thee will wee puſh downe our enemies, thorough thy Name we will tread them downe that riſe up againſt us.</hi> Thorough thy <hi>Name,</hi> that is, <hi>thorough thee: Thorough thee and thorough thy Name</hi> are the ſame. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48 10. <hi>According to thy Name ſo is thy praiſe,</hi> that is, <hi>thou art praiſed like thy ſelfe, as thou art in thy ſelfe, ſo thou art or oughteſt to be praiſed by thy people,</hi> the name is put for the perſon. You have it clearly, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.15. <hi>The number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,</hi> that is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons, ſo many perſons, becauſe numbred by their names.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Name of God is often in Scripture put for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>Thirdly, the Name of God is put for his Ordinances or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Goe yee now to my place which was in</hi> Shiloh, <hi>where I ſet my name at the firſt,</hi> Jerem. 7.12. that is, where I firſt ſet up my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like worſhip; becauſe as a man is knowne by his proper Name, ſo is God by his proper worſhip. And therefore falſe worſhip is the ſetting up of a <hi>ſtrange god.</hi> When we miſtake the name, we miſtake the perſon.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Name of God is that reverence, eſteeme and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which Angels and men give unto God. As we know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, the report and reputation that a man hath among men, is a mans name; what men ſpeake of him that is his name, ſuch an one hath a good name, we ſay; ſuch an one hath an ill name, that is, men ſpeake or thinke well or ill of ſuch perſons: So <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.4. When <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribes the Gyants, he ſaith, <hi>they were men of

                     </gap>
                  </note> becauſe the name of a man is the opinion he hath amongſt men; as a man is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, ſo his name is carried, and himſelfe is accepted in the world. So the name of God is that high eſteeme, thoſe honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apprehenſions, which Angels and men have of God, ſuch as the thoughts and ſpeeches of men are for the celebration of Gods glory and praiſe, ſuch is his name in the world, <hi>Bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By bleſſing God we are to underſtand, either, firſt what we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in word concerning God. God is bleſſed by his creatures, when his goodneſſe, and greatneſſe, and mercy, and bounty, and faithfulneſſe and juſtice are publiſhed with thankſ-giving and praiſe. Or God is bleſſed likewiſe, when we have high and great and glorious thoughts of God: when we inwardly feare and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and love, and honour God then we bleſſe God. The one is to bleſſe with the tongue; the other to bleſſe with the heart. The tongue bleſſing without the heart is but a <hi>tinckling cimball.</hi> The heart bleſſing without the tongue makes <hi>ſweet,</hi> but <hi>ſtill muſicke,</hi> both in conſort make that Harmony which fils and delights Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith here, <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord,</hi> we are to underſtand it both wayes, that <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes out the bleſſing of God with his mouth, and likewiſe he had high and reverent thoughts of God. His heart and tongue met at this worke and word.</p>
               <q>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</q>
               <p>We may note from hence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God is worthy of all praiſe and honour, not onely when hee doth enrich and ſtrengthen us, when he fills and protects us; but alſo when he doth impoveriſh and weaken us, when he empties and and ſmites us, when he gives us up to the will of our enemies, to the will of devils and wicked men, even then God is to be bleſſed.</hi> It is a good thing, and it is our duty to bleſſe God when we are rich and when we are full, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.10. <hi>When thou haſt eaten and art full then thou ſhalt bleſſe the Lord:</hi> But it is a farre better thing (yet but our duty) to bleſſe the Lord, when we are poore and weake; when we are empty and have nothing to eat, then to bleſſe the Lord is the breathing of an excellent ſpirit indeed. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>In every thing give thankes</hi>; Let God doe what he will with his children, they have cauſe to thanke him. <hi>As he is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98733:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God in himſelfe, bleſſed for evermore.</hi> When God thunders in judgements ſo loud, that he breaketh the <hi>Cedars</hi> and ſhakes the <hi>Wilderneſſe</hi>; then <hi>to give unto the Lord the glory due unto his Name, and in his Temple to speake of his glory,</hi> argues a ſpirit highly ennobl'd and glorious in grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. Therefore his children ſhould not reſt in this, that they beare afflictions, but they ſhould labour to bring their hearts, to bleſſe and glorifie God in, and for the afflictions that they beare. And a ſoule that thus honoureth God ſhall aſſuredly receive honour from God. That which the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the Saints ſuffering perſecution, is true of them in any kind of holy ſuffering, <hi>The Spirit of glory and of God doth reſt upon them,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.14. The Spirit of God is ſpoken of, as if it were unſetled and unquiet, and knew not where to fix it ſelfe, till it had found ſuch a ſoule: like <hi>Noah's Dove,</hi> that went <hi>hovering</hi> about and knew not where to <hi>reſt</hi> the <hi>ſole</hi> of her <hi>foot,</hi> till it came to the <hi>Arke</hi>; ſo the Spirit of God is expreſt, as <hi>hovering</hi> about from perſon to perſon, from place to place, as if it could not reſt any where till it finde a ſoule triumphing and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God in affliction, at leaſt lying quietly under affliction till God takes it off, and there the Spirit reſts and ſettles it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Obſerve further, that <hi>Job</hi> here bleſſeth God in his afflictions, and that makes the difference; his afflictions now are good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If we bleſſe God in our afflictions, then our afflictions are bleſſings unto us.</hi> We have ſo much bleſſing in our affliction, as we can bleſſe God for our affliction. There is a mighty power in this ſpeech, <hi>I bleſſe God,</hi> it changeth evill into good; here is an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Alchimy</hi> (as we may ſo ſpeake) whatſoever affliction you touch with bleſſing God, you turne that affliction to a bleſſing; if you have an Iron-yoake of affliction upon you, doe but touch it with bleſſing God, it turneth it into gold. When you have a heavy croſſe upon you, ready to weigh you downe, doe but touch the croſſe with this word from the heart, and it makes it as a crowne of glory upon your heads. Thus (I ſay) you may turne every evill into good, every affliction into a comfort and a bleſſing, if you can but touch it, with <hi>bleſſing the Name of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will come to the Concluſion.</p>
               <q>In all this <hi>Job</hi> ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</q>
               <p>This teſtimony the Lord giveth concerning <hi>Job,</hi> both in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98733:113"/>
to what he did, and to what he ſpake. <hi>In all this, In ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his mantle, in ſhaving his head, in falling to the ground, in worſhipping,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked ſhall I returne thither. The Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken away; bleſſed be the name of the Lord. In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not, neither charged God fooliſhly.</hi> God himſelf puts all the actions and all the ſpeeches of <hi>Job</hi> into the ballance, and finds not any lightnes in them, he bringeth all that he had done, and all that he had ſaid to the Touch-ſtone, and findes them pure met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. The Holy Ghoſt, the great and infallible moderatour of this cauſe, and queſtion betweene <hi>Job</hi> and Satan determines, <hi>That in all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not, neither did he charge God fooliſhly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it will be objected, Is there any man that ſinneth not? Or is there any man that ſinneth not in every thing? How then are we to underſtand what the Holy Ghoſt pronounceth, <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not.</hi> Is any man ſo holy or can his heart be kept in ſo holy a frame, as to doe and ſpeake ſo much, without any touch of ſinne, without any ſpot of defilement? <hi>Jobs</hi> queſtion Cap. 9. affirmes, that no man can doe any one act <hi>purely pure, Who can bring a cleane thing out of that which is uncleane?</hi> Now <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe in his nature was uncleane, he had uncleanneſſe in him, how then was a cleane thing brought out from <hi>Job?</hi> Whence had he ſuch a priviledge above his brethren, as not to ſin in doing and ſuffering ſo many things?</p>
               <p>There are ſome Popiſh Commentators, who would build the Tower of perfection upon this and other the like Scriptures, ſcil: <hi>That a man may in this life be freed from all ſinne.</hi> For the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this ſence and clearing of the text, I will give you the reſolution in a diſtinction or two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if we conſider ſinfull actions, they are of two ſorts. There are actions ſinfull in the matter, when the very thing done is a ſin, as to ſteale, to lye, to be drunke, to commit adultery and the like; the very thing done is a ſinne materially. There are other actions that are ſinfull in the formality or manner of doing; ſo a good worke in the matter may be ſinfull in the manner of doing. We doe not aſſert that all the workes of regenerate perſons are ſinnes, as if they were ſinfull actions, or that all that they doe is ſinfull in the matter, for that were a reproach to the Spirit of Chriſt, that were to reproach the grace of Chriſt, by which they being regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated act, and doe theſe things. But we poſitively affirme that to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98733:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the workes of regenerate perſons, to their beſt workes ſome defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cleaves, ſo that though the action be not ſinfull, yet there is ſome ſinne in the action. There is a great deale of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a ſinfull action and ſinne in an action: We have that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence expreſſely, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. Where the High-Prieſt is ſaid, <hi>to beare the iniquity of the holy things</hi>; holy things, yet iniquity in them; holy things in the matter of them, yet iniquity in the manner of performing them.</p>
               <p>Now when it is ſaid here, <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not,</hi> we are to underſtand it firſt thus. Here were no acts ſinfull in the matter of them, ſuch as Satan did promiſe unto himſelfe, and did undertake with God, that <hi>Job</hi> would ſpeake and breake out into: Satan was confident that <hi>Iob</hi> would <hi>blaspheme and curſe God to his face</hi>; this was an act of an high nature, ſinfull in the very matter of it, an act abominable, <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not</hi> ſuch a ſinne, he was not tranſported by paſſion or impatiency to reproach and curſe the living God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in Scripture language we are ſaid not to ſinne, when we doe not commit ſuch and ſuch ſinnes; as is cleare in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance about <hi>David,</hi> of whom this tranſcendent teſtimony is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 1 King. 15.5. <hi>That he turned not aſide from any thing the Lord commanded him all the dayes of his life, ſave onely in the matter of</hi> Uriah <hi>the</hi> Hittite; a high expreſſion of his holineſſe. What then? Shall we thinke that <hi>David</hi> never ſinned at all, but in that matter? No, the meaning of it is, that <hi>David</hi> never fell groſſely or foully, but that time; In compariſon of that act, all the reſt of the life of <hi>David</hi> went for ſo holy, as if he had lived without any ſinne at all. In this ſenſe the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> giveth the command not to ſinne, 1 Joh. 2.1. <hi>I write unto you little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>that you ſinne not</hi> (it is a poſſible precept in an evangelicall ſenſe) that is, that you ſinne not as wicked men doe, who can doe nothing elſe but ſinne. In this ſenſe Job <hi>ſinned not,</hi> he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe like a holy perſon, like an obedient child of God, like <hi>one born of God</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) whoſe character and priviledge it is, that he cannot ſin. Such have the bleſſing of impotency in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate part, ſo that they cannot ſin ſtrongly; though as yet they have not that bleſſed ability, in their regenerate part, not to ſinne at all.</p>
               <p>The Septuagint addes to this clauſe, <hi>He ſinned not before the Lord,</hi> or <hi>againſt the Lord.</hi> The Vulgar addes, thoſe words <hi>with
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98733:114"/>
his lips.</hi> Neither of them mend the ſence of the Hebrew Text, and the latter makes it worſe. For it is a higher and clearer teſtimony to ſay, <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not,</hi> then to ſay, <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not with his lipps,</hi> for he might ſin in <hi>thought,</hi> &amp;c. though it be moſt true which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.7. <hi>If any man offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, It is put for any rude, undigeſted or indiſcreet ſpeech, as <hi>La.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Thy Prophets have ſeen vain and fooliſh things for thee</hi>; They have ſeen fooliſh and unſavoury things for thee. Hence the word is uſed to expres madnes, becauſe madnes is the height of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being without any ſeaſoning, without any temper, a thing that hath no taſte of wiſdom or goodnes in it, Jer. 23.13. <hi>I have ſeen folly in the Prophets of</hi> Samaria, that is, they are unſavoury, their ſpeeches are untempered morter, they are fooliſh and vaine. So then he did not <hi>charge God with folly or charge God fooliſhly,</hi> hath this
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98733:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſenſe, <hi>Job did not speake any thing raſhly or unbecomming the Majeſty of God, or charge him in the leaſt to have dealt unwiſely or unjustly with him.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Satan thou diddeſt expect that</hi> Job <hi>ſhould now at this time have charged me home, and have laid load upon me with complainings, for dealing thus with him:</hi> thou expecteſt that he ſhould have broken out into the dialect of hell it ſelfe, ſuch words as theſe, <hi>Why what have I done againſt God, that he ſhould deale thus with me? Is this the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that I ſhall receive for the worke and ſervice I have done him? Will he diſcourage and diſhearten others, from comming on to his ſervice by my ſad example? Is it justice in God that I who have lived ſo innocently ſhould be thus extreamely afflicted? Could the Lord finde out no ſwearers, no drunkards, no adulterers in the world to let Satan looſe upon, but he must needs turne him looſe upon me? Had he no other Butt in the world to ſhoot the arrowes of his indignation at, but at an innocent breaſt? Is this a juſt God who uſes his ſervants thus? Or if he be omniſcient and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, why then did he not protect me from Satans rage? Why did he not defend me from the violence of thoſe evill men?</hi> Such kind of ſpeeches, or to this effect, Satan expected, <hi>Job</hi> would have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered raſhly againſt the Lord: but he is deceived, <hi>Job</hi> hath no ſuch thought, much leſſe did hee ſpeake ſuch words, either againſt the juſtice, or wiſedome, or power of God; hee charges no folly upon God, the only wiſe God, but gives him glory, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Bleſſed be his Name whatſoever hee doth with me or mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Learne from hence firſt, what blaſphemy is, or what it is to curſe God; <hi>To curſe God is to charge God with folly, or with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things fooliſhly and raſhly.</hi> For theſe expreſſions expound one another. Satan ſaid <hi>Job</hi> would curſe God; the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Job hath not charged God fooliſhly,</hi> therefore that is a definition of Gods owne making, plainly declaring what it is to curſe God: Yet every ſpeech or act unbecomming the Majeſty, wiſdome and power of God doth not preſently denominate a man a blaſphemer: There may be blaſphemy in what is ſpoken, and yet the perſon ſpeaking not a blaſphemer. <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe ſpake many things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward unadviſedly in the heat of diſpute, but he blaſphemed not. Blaſphemy or curſing of God properly taken, is ever joyned with an intent to caſt reproach upon God: As every one is not a lyar
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98733:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that telleth what is not true, but he that telleth an untruth, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be an untruth, with an intent to deceive and wrong others. So he that thinkes or ſpeakes a thing unbecomming God, with an intent to reproach or ſlander God and his wayes, this is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming indeed.</p>
               <p>Secondly obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Impatience under, and murmuring at the croſſe, which God laies upon us, is a charging of God with folly.</hi> Murmuring againſt God, queſtions the wiſdome of God. Complaints have a charge in them. We taxe what is done while we ſubmit not to what is done. When we lie under Gods hand quietly and ſilently, then we ſpeak the praiſe of God, then our carriage aſcribes all wiſdome, honour and glory unto him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In that it is here ſaid by way of excellency concerning <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>in all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not,</hi> referring it to his behaviour under theſe afflictions, as if the Holy Ghoſt had ſaid, it is matter of admiration that in this, in all this <hi>Job</hi> ſhould not ſinne. Note from hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is an high act, one of the higheſt acts of grace, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in thought and word under great afflictions. In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not,</hi> as if he had ſaid, it had not been much for <hi>Iob</hi> not to ſin in other things; but in this affliction, in this diſtreſſe, being ſo put to it, being thus tryed, in all this not to ſinne, is <hi>Grace, almoſt to a miracle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Note this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is well done by us, ſhall be ſure to receive a faire teſtimony from God.</hi> When <hi>Iob</hi> had carried himſelfe diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſpoken diſcreetly, the Lord hides not this in darkneſſe, hee ſhuts it not up in ſilence: but proclaimes the innocency and uprightneſſe of his carriage in this preſent paſſage of his life, as he had done before, concerning the whole courſe of his life and converſation, <hi>that he was perfect and upright.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle publiſheth, <hi>Glory and honour and peace to every man that worketh good,</hi> Rom. 2.10 They that carry themſelves well ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuffering or in working for God, ſhall have glory and honour and peace from God. No man needs, blow a trumpet in his owne praiſe, when he hath done well, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. What we doe well, the Lord himſelfe will report to all the world, <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:98733:116"/>And ſo wee have done with this third part of the Chapter, and with this whole Chapter, which containes (as you have heard) thoſe three generals, the deſcription of <hi>Iobs</hi> proſperous eſtate; The deſcription of his tryals and afflictions, and the deſcription of his carriage under thoſe afflictions. Now when he is come off from this aſſault without wound, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any touch of ſinne. Satan perceiving himſelfe defeated and fruſtrated in this attempt, will not yet give it over, he is reſtleſſe, he will attempt him once more. We ſhall finde him in the next Chapter at the Aſſembly againe, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his motion for a ſecond aſſault, that hee may have leave to lay his ſiedge nearer and cloſer to <hi>Iob,</hi> preſuming that though he had not prevailed at the firſt, yet he ſhall at the ſecond charge; let me charge him but once more, and then ſee his fall, <hi>He will curſe thee to thy face.</hi>

               <p>Others fixe it upon the laſt day of the weeke, affirming that this was the Sabbath day. And that this was a convention or Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Church on Earth for the ſolemne worſhip of God upon that day, which is here called, <hi>A preſenting themſelves before the Lord</hi>; in concurrence with which opinion, the <hi>ſonnes of God</hi> muſt needs be interpreted holy men. I find ſome affirming, that men are not called the ſons of God in all the old Teſtament, but the Angels only. And ſo they take that Text, Gen 6.2, <hi>The ſons of God ſaw the daughters of men,</hi> &amp;c. for the Angels either good or bad, who being taken with the beauty of thoſe daughters, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bodies came into them, of whom came the Giants. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit as monſtrous as thoſe Giants, and fitter for a fabuliſt then a Divine. On the other extreame,<note n="*" place="margin">In his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily on Gen. 6.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Chryſostome</hi> denyes that the Angels are at all called the <hi>ſonnes of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may walke ſafely in a middle way betweene theſe two. For both Angels and men are called the <hi>ſonnes of God:</hi> Why Angels are called the ſons of God hath been ſhewed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 6. Men are called the ſons of God for two reaſons; either for their <hi>power</hi> or <hi>greatneſſe,</hi> ſo they <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. might be called the ſonnes of God, becauſe great and powerfull on the earth. Or rather ſecondly, for their piety and holineſſe by which they reſemble God, and in which they ſerve God as a ſonne doth the Father. Indeed the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes that the priviledge of ſonſhip was brought-in by the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt, who is ſaid, <hi>In the fullneſſe of time to be made of a woman,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That we might receive the adoption of ſonnes, Gal.</hi> 4.5. But in Scripture a thing is ſpoken of as newly done, when it is more fully done, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. The Holy Ghoſt is ſaid not to be given at that time, becauſe he had not been ſo plentifully given. And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſpeakes, as if the way into Heaven had been but then opened, becauſe it was then more clearly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. So we are ſaid to receive the adoption of ſons, when Chriſt came in the fleſh, becauſe then our ſon-ſhip was
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98733:118"/>
more apparant, though before it was as reall.</p>
               <p>So then according to this Interpretation the ſence of the words is. That upon the Sabbath day, when the ſervants of God, the faithfull of that age and place were met together to celebrate the publick worſhip of God, Satan (the evill ſpirit) who is ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to oppoſe and reſiſt us, to interrupt and hinder us, when we appeare before the Lord in holy duties) came alſo among them to preſent himſelfe before the Lord.</p>
               <p>I propoſe this as an opinion to which my owne inclination is not ſtrong. Theſe words with the context (as was noted in the former Chapter) ſeeming to me, rather a repreſentation of Gods providence towards man, then a deſcription of mans worſhip ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered unto God.</p>
               <q>Againe there was a day.</q>
               <p>It may be yet further enquired how much time paſſed betweene the firſt and this ſecond day of appearance. Some affirme it was the immediate day after; others the immediate Sabbath after. A third opinion deferrs it to the yeare after; Satan cunningly delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the buſineſſe all that while, to the intent he might more fully ſee how the former affliction wrought, what effects it had or would have upon <hi>Job,</hi> before he attempts a ſecond.</p>
               <p>The text reſolveth us in neither of theſe, but leaveth it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and undetermined, ſaying onely, <hi>Againe there was a day.</hi> It is moſt probable that there was ſuch a diſtance of time betweene theſe two afflictions, as was competent to a full diſcovery of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit, under the firſt. As when Chriſt was tempted and had foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Satan in that temptation, it is ſaid, <hi>the Devill departed from him for a ſeaſon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk 4.13.</note> he left him, probably, to ſee what effects might follow upon the former temptation: So Satan having tempted <hi>Job,</hi> and tempted him by a temptation, though one in the generall, yet with a foure-fold aſſault, foure ſeverall meſſengers, making (as it were) foure charges upon him, he leaveth him for a ſeaſon, and <hi>againe when there was a day,</hi> he returnes to renew the aſſault and battery.</p>
               <p>I ſhall paſſe-over the two verſes following in all that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, opened in the former Chapter. But in the latter end of the third verſe, there is ſomewhat added very materiall, where the Lord beſpeakes Satan concerning Job, <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in the Earth, a perfect
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98733:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and an upright man, one that feareth God and eſcheweth evill?</hi> (This was the Character which God gave of him before in the former Chapter, but now he goeth on) <hi>And ſtill he holdeth faſt his integrity, although thou movedſt me againſt him to deſtroy him without cauſe.</hi> This is ſuperadded to his teſtimony, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation is enlarged. <hi>Job</hi> (you ſee) hath gained in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict: he was deſcribed before as an holy man, now he is deſcribed as a tryed man, as an approved ſouldier. <hi>Job</hi> hath obtained this honour in the former combate with Satan, a glorious addition to his character: As the patience and other graces of <hi>Job</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſo did the teſtimony of God increaſe concerning him. Note from this addition only in the generall thus much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſuch as honour God, God will honour.</hi> If we doe any new or further ſervice for God, God will adde ſome further honour and reſpect unto us. If we do, or ſay, or ſuffer any thing extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for God, God will ſay, or doe ſomewhat more than ordinary concerning us. The old character did not ſerve, when <hi>Job</hi> had done this new ſervice. <hi>God will never conceale any of our graces, no nor the improvement of any of our graces.</hi> If we ſpeake but a word for God, we ſhall heare of it againe; God takes it and pens it downe, as it is ſaid, <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.16. <hi>They that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard, and a booke of remembrance was written</hi>; God ſets it downe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: So he recorded what <hi>Job</hi> had ſpoken, and gives it him in at the next meeting with Satan. <hi>We can never looſe either by doing or ſuffering for God.</hi> All ſhall be recompenced to the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. As it is uſuall with <hi>Kings</hi> and great-men of the world, for great ſervices done them (eſpecially in warres and battels) to make additions to the titles of honour, to give ſome new motto's, or put ſome new devices in the Coate-armour of thoſe who ſerve them. Thus doth God here. <hi>Job</hi> having play'd the <hi>man</hi> (as we ſay) or rather the <hi>Saint</hi> in that former combate, he hath a new title of honour put into his ſtile: Now it is not only <hi>Job, a man that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God and eſcheweth evill</hi>; but, Job <hi>a man that holdeth faſt his integritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider the words themſelves.</p>
               <q>And ſtill he holdeth faſt his integrity.</q>
               <p>The words [<hi>And ſtill</hi>] or to this preſent time, may have a double reference. Firſt, barely to the time paſt: <hi>Job</hi> was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

a perfect and a ſound man in former times, but hee is ſo ſtill, ſo at preſent. Or rather ſecondly, it referres to the affliction and loſſes hee had ſuffered; as hee was in former times, ſo hee is at this time; as he was in proſperous times, ſo hee is in troubleſome times: When the day was light and cleare to him, <hi>Job</hi> was a perfect man, and now the day hath nothing but darkneſſe and gloomineſſe in it. <hi>Job</hi> is a perfect man ſtill, though wounded in his eſtate and broken in his outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, yet he is as ſound and whole in his ſpirit, as ever he was. Though cattell, ſervants, children be dead and gone, be ſpoyl'd and loſt: yet grace is ſafe, and faith tryumphs, <hi>hee ſtill holdeth faſt his integrity.</hi>

               <p>This which we tranſlate by two words, is but one word in the Hebrew. Our language is not comprehenſive enough to expreſſe the fullneſſe of that word, in a word. <hi>Iob</hi> doth not only hold his integrity, but he holdeth it faſt: the word implyes a ſtrength in holding, to hold a thing firmely. And more, the word hath a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Emphaſis in it; it ſignifieth not only to hold a thing by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſtrength, wherewith formerly we did hold it; but it doth import thus much, to waxe ſtronger in the holding of it, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile or increaſe in ſtrength. As when <hi>David</hi> ſent <hi>Ioab</hi> to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the people,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioab</hi> was unwilling, and ſaid to the King, <hi>Now the Lord thy God adde unto the people an hundred-fold, but why doth my Lord the King delight in this thing?</hi> Then it followes, <hi>Notwithſtanding the Kings word prevailed againſt</hi> Joab. That which is there tranſlated, <hi>And his word prevailed,</hi> is the ſame with this we tranſlate here, <hi>Holdeth faſt</hi>; the Kings word did take a prevailing hold upon <hi>Ioab,</hi> or held him faſt to the doing of the Kings command, though he would have got oft from the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: So we may underſtand it here, <hi>ſtill he prevaileth or waxeth ſtronger in his integrity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame word is uſed by the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> cap. 3.13, 14. where God convinceth thoſe proud ſpirits that puffed at his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Your words</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have been ſtout againſt me.</hi> That which we tranſlate, <hi>have been ſtout,</hi> is the ſame with this in the text of <hi>Iob; your words have beene stout,</hi> that is, <hi>they have growne stronger and ſtronger againſt me and my waies,</hi> you are confirm'd in wickedneſſe; whereas your hearts ſhould have beene
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98733:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
brought downe and humbled, you are increaſt and hardned in your obſtinacy and rebellion. Such is the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and meaning of the word in this place. <hi>Iob</hi> by this oppoſition growes more ſtrong and ſtout in his integrity, he is ſo farre from being daunted, that he is encourag'd; he is as he was, nay more than he was, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, <hi>ſtill he holdeth faſt his integrity.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>His integrity.</q>
               <p>It is a word of the ſame root with that uſed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>There was a man in the Land of</hi> Uz, <hi>and this man was perfect,</hi> and theſe words illuſtrate and expound one another; to be a <hi>perfect man,</hi> is to be a <hi>man of integrity</hi>; there, he was a perfect man; now, hee is a man <hi>holding faſt</hi> that perfection, namely, his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</p>
               <p>From this firſt branch obſerve,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That Satan in all his temptations plants his chiefeſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery against ſincerity.</hi> Hence it is here expreſt, that <hi>Iob ſtill held faſt his integrity,</hi> as if the Holy Ghoſt would intimate this unto us, that Satan pulled more at that, than at his eſtate. Satan did not care at all to pull <hi>Iobs</hi> Oxen from him, or his Sheepe from him, or his children from him, but to pull his grace from him; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Iob</hi> held that faſt: Without queſtion Satan aſſaulted that moſt, which <hi>Iob</hi> held moſt; the thing that Satan aymed at, was not to make <hi>Iob</hi> a poore man, but to make him a ſinfull man; and he would never have troubled himſelfe to robbe him of his riches, but only in ſubordination to the robbing him of his graces. That was the booty Satan look'd for. Satan look'd at his cattell, only as pay for his Army of <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Caldeans:</hi> but he look'd upon his grace (if he could have got it from him) as pay for principalities and powers. As grace gotten or improv'd is the joy of Angels: So if grace could be ſtolne away or deſtroy'd, it would be the joy of Devils. This was Satans hope.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Note this, <hi>Iob holdeth faſt his integrity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whatſoever a godly man looſeth, he will be ſure to lay hold of his graces, he will hold spirituals, what ever becomes of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals.</hi> He will be ſure to take faſt hold of theſe, when all is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when riches are going, when children are going, when friends are going, when liberty is going, yea when life is going too, then he layes faſt hold upon his integrity. And ſaith (as <hi>Iacob</hi>) to the Angell, <hi>I will not let thee goe,</hi> and he ſaith it without exception:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98733:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for he knowes he cannot be bleſſed if that goe. <hi>Integrity</hi> is his <hi>Benjamin,</hi> all the children he hath ſhall goe, but this ſonne of his right hand muſt not; For indeed his life is bound-up in the life of grace. And if he part with that, he muſt <hi>lie downe with ſorrow in his grave.</hi> Wherefore he is reſolved not to part with that, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he parts with. As it is with a man at Sea in a Shipwracke, when all is caſt over-board, the corne that feedes him, and the cloathes that cover him, yet he ſwims to the ſhore if hee can with his life in his hand. Or as it is with a valiant <hi>Standard-bearer,</hi> that carries the banner in warre, if he ſees all loſt, he will wrappe the Banner about his body, and chuſe rather to die in that as his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſheet, then let any man take it from him or ſpoyle him of it, he will <hi>hold that faſt,</hi> though he looſe his life for it. So doth <hi>Iob</hi> here, ſo doth every one that is of <hi>Iobs</hi> heavenly temper and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reſolution: in the greateſt ſtorme, in the hotteſt aſſault, he will wrap himſelfe round about with his <hi>integrity,</hi> winde that about him, and will not let it goe. Kill him if you will, deſtroy him if you will, he will never part with his integrity, though he part with life. Indeed there is nothing elſe can ſtand a man in ſtead to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if that be loſt, all's loſt. A man that is in danger of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning will lay hold upon any thing, upon a ſtraw, upon a ruſh, though it have no ſtrength to ſupport him: Men in danger will lay hold upon ſomewhat; they that are wiſe will lay hold upon the rocke, upon that which will doe them good, in an evill day; They will lay hold upon Chriſt, they will lay hold upon promiſes (in laying hold upon our integrity, all that is done) then they are ſure to live: for <hi>Wiſdome</hi> (that is Chriſt) <hi>is a tree of life to all that lay hold upon her,</hi> Pro. 3.18.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is conſiderable, that this word is uſed for the laying hold upon our weapons, either to defend our ſelves or to offend and aſſault our enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.2. <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>that God would take hold of ſhield and buckler, and ſtand up for his helpe.</hi> We may note from hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That integrity is our armes.</hi> Integrity is a Chriſtians weapon, <hi>Iob</hi> laies hold upon his integrity as a ſword to wound his enemy, and as a ſhield and buckler to ſave and defend himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, from that expoſition of the word, that it ſignifieth not only <hi>to be ſtrong,</hi> but <hi>to prevaile,</hi> it ſignifieth an <hi>overcomming power; he doth hold faſt,</hi> that is, <hi>he prevaileth with his integrity.</hi> We may note,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:98733:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>That grace doth not only oppoſe but conquer Satan and all his temptations.</hi> He doth prevaile in his integrity (ſo the Hebrew may be rendred in the letter.) Sometimes (you know) there is a warre and oppoſition, when there is no conqueſt; a warre may be carried on divers yeares in a nation, or betweene nations, when there is no abſolute victory on either ſide; as we ſee by woefull and lamentable experience in <hi>Germany,</hi> where there hath been oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one ſide againſt another above theſe 20. yeares, and yet no ſide hath prevailed. But as grace makes warre, ſo grace gets the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, grace gets the day, and will ſhortly make a finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; yea, there is not onely a <hi>conqueſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Roman.</hi> 8.) <hi>but thorough Chriſt wee are more than conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> place, I told you that the word ſignifies, <hi>to increaſe in strength, he holdeth faſt his integrity, or he increaſeth in ſtrength in his integrity.</hi> Note hence. That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>True grace gains by oppoſition.</hi> True grace is increaſed the more it is aſſaulted. Satan comes a purpoſe to deſtroy <hi>Iobs</hi> graces. <hi>Iob</hi> waxeth ſtronger in his graces. True grace will doe ſo in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is. Hypocrites (who have but a ſhew of grace, painted grace) fall off in times of tryall, in times of temptation; that which onely ſeemeth to be ſomewhat, cometh to nothing, but that which is ſomewhat, cometh to more.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Conſider the Emphaſis of the words. God ſpeakes of this in a kind of admiration; hee putteth a greater Emphaſis upon this than upon the other part of <hi>Iobs</hi> character.</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Verſe 3.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> that there is none like him in the Earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and eſcheweth evill? and ſtill he holdeth faſt his integrity.</p>
               </q>
               <p>God ſpeakes of it, as a matter of wonder, a rare thing. From this obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That to hold our integrity in evill times, is not only good but admirable.</hi> It is that which doth even (as we may ſo ſpeake) provoke God himſelfe to an admiration. It is a truth whether it be in regard of perſonall troubles or nationall troubles, to hold faſt and keepe cloſe to God in ſuch diſtreſſes is admirable. To continue good, while we ſuffer evill, is the height and crowne of goodneſſe. As it is that which putteth one of the greateſt aggravations upon the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98733:121"/>
ſinfulneſſe of men, that they will hold faſt their ſinnes in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of judgements. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> with much elegancy of ſpeech and vehemency of ſpirit urgeth this againſt the Jewes, <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>I have given you cleanneſſe of teeth, yet have yee not retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto me: I have with-holden the raine, yet have yee not retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto me: I have ſmitten you with blasting, yet have ye not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto me: I have ſent among you the peſtilence and the ſword, yet have yee not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> takes up the ſame argument, having before ſpoken of judgements ſent upon them, <hi>Yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they hold faſt deceit and refuſe to returne</hi> (Cap. 8.5.) they held faſt deceit, though they were afflicted, that aggravated their ſinfulneſſe. Now (I ſay) as it makes <hi>ſinne out of meaſure ſinfull,</hi> to hold it faſt when God afflicteth; ſo it <hi>makes grace out of meaſure gracious,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a wonderfull ſplendour and glory upon it, if we hold faſt our grace, when troubles and afflictions meet us in the holding of it forth; and God will put an Emphaſis upon ſuch a one for grace, as he did upon <hi>Ahaz</hi> for his ſinne, 2 Chron. 28.22. <hi>In the time of his diſtreſſe did he trespaſſe yet more againſt the Lord, This is that King Ahaz,</hi> that brand is put upon him. So there is an honour ſtamp'd on <hi>Job</hi> in this teſtimony, <hi>that in the time of his diſtreſſe, he did yet more good, This is that</hi> Job: to ſerve, beleeve and love God more in diſtreſſe, this is integrity to a wonder, this drawes the heart of God toward ſuch, and makes them truly glorious in the eyes of godly men.</p>
               <p>That which followes in the text, doth yet more advance the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Job</hi> in this victory, <hi>still he holdeth fast,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <q>Though thou movedſt me againſt him to deſtroy him without cauſe.</q>

                  <hi>Though thou movedſt me</hi>] The word here uſed <hi>to move,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth more than a bare motion, it carries in it a perſwaſion, and more then a bare perſwaſion, it carries in it a vehement inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: As when a man doth perſwade a thing by arguments and ſtrong reaſons; that is the force of the word; as in that place, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.25. <hi>There was none like</hi> Ahab <hi>which did ſell himſelfe to worke wickedneſſe in the ſight of the Lord, whom</hi> Jezabel <hi>his wife ſtirred up: ſtirred up</hi> is the word in the text, <hi>thou movedſt me; Jezabel</hi> moved <hi>Ahab,</hi> incited him, never gave him over, by arguments and reaſons, by this conſideration and that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to doe wickedly in <hi>Iſrael</hi>: So here, Satan did as it were
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98733:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
plie God with arguments and reaſons to inſtigate him againſt <hi>Job, Thou didst move me againſt him.</hi> Satan is a cunning Oratour and knowes how to handle a matter, that it may take with greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>Some may queſtion, how can this be? Will God be mooved by Satan? Is not the Lord unchangeable? Have Satans words and arguments ſuch power with God to moove him to doe a thing?</p>
               <p>I anſwer it two wayes; We may cleare it firſt thus. As the Saints and people of God in prayer are ſaid to move God, and to prevaile with God, they are ſaid to carry a buſineſſe with God. Now you know what they doe in prayer, they doe not only ſpread a petition barely before God, but they ſtrengthen it with all the arguments they can, argument upon argument, pleading upon pleading; yet the Lord himſelfe is not ſtirred, he is not changed at all by the prayer of his people, it is not to be thought that the Lord upon the prayers of his people, takes up any new thoughts, or puts on any new reſolutions to doe this or that; for a mercy that is but a day old in regard of our prayer obtaining it, is an eternity old in regard of God purpoſing it, therefore God is not changed at all; but he is ſaid to be moved to give or doe, as or when we pray, becauſe he giveth and doth what he himſelfe had purpoſed to give, when we ſhould pray: for as God from all eternity did purpoſe to give to his people ſuch and ſuch mercies,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quanquam De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us à nullo poteſt moveri, ad ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid volendum de novo, cum ſit immutabili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> ſo he did purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, to give them when they prayed. Now then as it is in regard of his peoples prayer and ſeeking for mercy, they move God; but it is onely the bringing forth of that which he had in his heart from all eternity to doe for them: So here in this caſe, God had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe from all eternity to try <hi>Job,</hi> and likewiſe he did purpoſe the way and the meanes of it, that it ſhould be done upon the motion and inſtigation of Satan. For although God cannot be moved by any to doe a thing, which before he intended not, he is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: yet as by his eternall will and counſell, he doth produce things in time: So likewiſe from eternity he did order and will the manner of their producing, he purpoſed to do good for his Church upon the ſupplications of his ſervants, and ſometimes to afflict his Church or ſervants at the inſtigation of Satan.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This place [<hi>thou movedst me against him</hi>] is to be underſtood by a figure, very frequent in the Scripture. God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of himſelfe after the manner of men; becauſe as men uſually
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98733:122"/>
when they do a thing are moved by others to do it; and by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are ſometime prevailed with, to doe that which they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not an houre before. So God is ſaid to doe a thing upon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though he intended it from eternity, often deſcending to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe himſelfe by that which is common to men, though his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing it be tranſcendent, infinitely beyond men.</p>
               <p>From the force of this word ſo explained, <hi>Thou movedſt me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</hi> Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Satan is an earneſt and importunatè ſolicitour againſt the people and Church of God</hi>; he without ceaſing provokes God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, he bends his wits and ſtraines his language to the height, in pleading againſt them, to get them delivered up into his hands, or into the hands of his inſtruments.</p>
               <p>And if Satan be thus zealous, ſo importunate a ſollicitour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Saints. It may teach us to be as earneſt and zealous for the Saints. Satan doth not onely move, but he moveth by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he incites: It is not enough to pray by propoſing our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but we muſt pray enforcing and preſſing our deſires; ſuch a holy unquietneſſe of ſpirit, as is expreſſed by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.1. <hi>For</hi> Zions <hi>ſake will I not hold my peace, and for</hi> Jeruſalems <hi>ſake will I not reſt,</hi> &amp;c. Such was that required of the <hi>Watch-men ſet upon the walls of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which ſhould never hold their peace day nor night: Yee that make mention of the Lord, or yee that are the Lords remembrancers, keepe not ſilence, and give him no reſt till he eſtabliſh, and till he make</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a praiſe in the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 62. ver. 6, 7. This duty is now doubled on us by the great afflictions and greater feares of <hi>Sion.</hi> When Chriſt was in his agony, he prayed more earneſtly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.44. And when his Church is in an agony, we ought to pray more earneſtly. At ſuch a time we muſt mingle more fire with our prayers, we muſt pray more fervently. At ſuch a time we muſt mingle more water with our prayers, wee muſt pray more repentingly: We muſt with <hi>Jacob (Hoſ.</hi> 12.) <hi>weepe and make ſupplication.</hi> At ſuch a time we muſt mingle more faith with our prayers, we muſt pray more beleevingly. In a word at ſuch a time, every prayer muſt be a pleading, yea a wreſtling with God, a wreſtling with reſolution, not to let him goe untill wee have got a bleſſing, till wee prevaile with God to deſtroy his Churches enemies, as Satan in the text mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God to deſtroy <hi>Job,</hi> his <hi>ſervant</hi> and his <hi>friend.</hi> So it followes, <hi>Thou movedſt me againſt him to deſtroy him.</hi>

               <p>Firſt in reference unto Satan. God tells Satan, <hi>thou movedſt me againſt him without cauſe,</hi> that is, <hi>Job</hi> never gave thee any cauſe why thou ſhouldeſt make ſuch a motion againſt him; <hi>Job</hi> had never wronged thee, or done thee any hurt, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith of his

               <p n="2">2. In reference unto Satan, <hi>without cauſe,</hi> that is, <hi>Thou didſt not alleadge any ſufficient cauſe or charge him with any particular crime; thou didſt onely bring in a generall ſuspition againſt him; there was not ſo much as a common fame</hi> (as you know it was a courſe to accuſe men upon common fame.) So ſaith God here, <hi>it was nothing but a ſuspition raiſed out of thine owne braine</hi> (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thoſe common fames, that we heard of not long ſince, upon which many were accuſed, yea condemn'd, were only ſuſpitions borne in the brains of thoſe men.) So here <hi>Job</hi> was charged meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the ſuſpition of Satan, there was no crime directly allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor any evill report in the world againſt him; cauſe was not ſhew'd legally, therefore <hi>without cauſe thou movedſt me againſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In reference unto Satan, <hi>without cauſe,</hi> that is, <hi>it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth upon the tryall that thou didst move me against him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe; that which thou didst pretend to be the cauſe, was not found in</hi> Job, <hi>thou pretendeſt he was an hypocrite and ſerved me for himſelfe; now thou ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>If we conſider the words in the ſecond place with reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>Thou didst move me againſt him without cauſe,</hi> then we muſt take heed of thinking, that God doth any thing without cauſe; No, the wiſe God doth every thing in number, weight and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; he doth every thing upon great reaſon, upon the higheſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. God will not doe the loweſt thing, but upon the height of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he doth the leaſt thing upon greater reaſon, than the greateſt Polititians in the world doe the greateſt. Therefore God had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, important reaſon to give <hi>Job</hi> up to be afflicted. He did it for the tryall of <hi>Job,</hi> he did it for the magnifying of his free-grace, and the graces of his free Spirit in his weake creature, he did it that <hi>Job</hi> might be ſet up as an example of patience, he did it to diſcover the ſlander of the devill; therefore he did it for ſtrong reaſons, it was not without cauſe in reference unto God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:98733:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>Laſtly, If we conſider it in reference unto <hi>Job,</hi> it was not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without cauſe neither; for though there was not that cauſe in him, which Satan pretended, namely groſſe hypocriſie: yet if the Lord ſhould ſearch and ſift him narrowly (as if he ſhould ſearch and ſift the holieſt of his ſervants, his pure eyes and holy nature would find ſinne enough in them, which might juſtifie him, or ſhew to his juſtice ſufficient cauſe (take the ſinne in it ſelfe) not onely to afflict them temporally, but to lay his hand upon them for ever.) Should God (I ſay) have tryed him thoroughly and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon ſinne in it ſelfe, he might finde cauſe to afflict him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his ſinne. So then abſolutely in reference unto <hi>Job,</hi> it was not without cauſe, God might have found cauſe in regard of his ſinne.</p>
               <p>But there were other cauſes in reference unto <hi>Job,</hi> it was to try <hi>Iob,</hi> to exerciſe <hi>Iob,</hi> it was that <hi>Iob</hi> might have further honour after the tryall: There might have been a reaſon in ſinne (if the Lord had marked iniquity) And there were many reaſons in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his good, why the Lord did leave him thus in the hands of Satan to be afflicted.</p>
               <p>To winde it up. If we looke upon Satan, then it was without that cauſe he pretended, it was without any direct charge, it was a meer ſuſpition, <hi>Iob</hi> had never wronged him. But if we reſpect God, it is not without cauſe, God doth all things for weighty reaſons. And if we reſpect <hi>Iob,</hi> God (poſſibly, yea eaſily) might have found a ſin in him (any ſin in it ſelf conſidered would do it) as the cauſe of his affliction; And he had other actuall reaſons in reference both to the being and improvement of his graces, why he left him thus in the hands of Satan.</p>
               <p>Hence we may learne. Firſt (in that God ſaith, <hi>Thou mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedſt me against him to deſtroy him without cauſe.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That pure or rather impure malice, ſtirreth Satan against the people of God.</hi> Though he alwayes pretends ſomewhat in them, yet the cauſe is in himſelfe. God now diſcovers he doth nothing but out of very malice, pure malice againſt his ſervants. Satan hath two names in Scripture, noting his two ſpeciall workes, <hi>Temptation and accuſation.</hi> He ſollicits good men to doe evill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; Hence he hath his name, <hi>the Tempter.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we may note,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:98733:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>That God doth afflict his people ſometimes without respect unto their ſinnes. Thou diddest move me againſt him without cauſe.</hi> It was not in regard of his hypocriſie or of any thing thou diddeſt charge him with, why I did afflict him and lay my hand upon him. Though all men have alwayes ſinne enough to be the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe, yet oftentimes ſinne is not the moving cauſe of their afflictions. When the Diſciples put that queſtion to Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the blind man, Joh. 9.2. <hi>Maſter who did ſinne this man or his parents, that he was borne blind? Ieſus anſwered, neither hath this man ſinned nor his parents,</hi> (not as if either of them were without ſinne, but to ſhew that they had not ſinned as to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>ſc.</hi> their ſinne was not the cauſe of this blindneſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the next words, he aſſignes the cauſe) <hi>But</hi> (ſc. he was borne blind) <hi>that the workes of God ſhould be made manifeſt.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are alwayes from ſinne, but not alwayes for ſinne. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they at all for ſinne (upon beleevers) by way of the leaſt ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God (that chaſtiſement Chriſt hath ſo fully borne, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. that no beleevers finger ſhall ever ake in that ſenſe.) But they are often afflicted for ſinne by way of purgation or prevention,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may note this likewiſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God will at the last give testimony for the clearing of the innocency of his ſervants against all Satans malicious accuſations.</hi> God himſelfe gives teſtimony here a ſecond time concerning <hi>Iob, Thou didst move me againſt him without cauſe,</hi> thou diddeſt move me to it, but it is cleare, and I give my ſentence, there was no ſuch cauſe as thou didſt ſuggeſt againſt him, why I ſhould deſtroy him.</p>
               <p>When the Lord had thus called Satan to account concerning <hi>Iob,</hi> whether he had conſidered him both in his radicall graces, and in this additionall grace, the <hi>holding faſt of his integrity</hi>; Then Satan comes forth to anſwer this alſo. <hi>Haſt thou</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job <hi>that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and eſcheweth evill? And ſtill he holdeth faſt his integrity, although thou movedst me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, to deſtroy him without cauſe?</hi> Yes ſaith Satan in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>And Satan anſwered the Lord and ſaid, Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath will he give for his life. But put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:98733:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>Here is Satans anſwer with his motion upon it.</p>
               <p>By his anſwer he labours to blot and obſcure the glory which <hi>Job</hi> had gained in the former battell; and by his motion he labours to bring him about unto a ſecond tryall. As by his anſwer in the former Chapter (a little to compare him with himſelfe) Satan ſlandered <hi>Jobs</hi> actions, ſo by his anſwer here, he ſlanders <hi>Jobs</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. There it was for ſomething that <hi>Job</hi> ſerved God, and here that which <hi>Job</hi> had ſuffered is nothing.</p>
               <p>It is Satans trade (and he hath many children of the ſame occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation) to ſlander and to ſlight whatſoever the ſervants of God, either doe or ſuffer. Before he ſlandered <hi>Jobs</hi> active obedience, now hee ſlanders his paſſive obedience. What is this (ſaith hee) tuſh, <hi>Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath will he give for his life:</hi> It is a ſlight tryall that he hath paſt yet; what great matter is it if he <hi>hold fast his integrity</hi>; who would not, who could not <hi>hold-faſt</hi> for any thing that hath been done to him yet? Let us try him againe.</p>
               <p>For the clearing of this we will examine the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath will he give for his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee here that malice is ſteeped in wit, Satan anſwereth by a Proverbe, <hi>Skin for skin,</hi> &amp;c. A proverbiall, quick, ſharp ſpeech, the generall ſenſe of which and Satans intendments are very cleare.</p>
               <p>The generall ſenſe of this proverbiall ſpeech is this. <hi>That life is the moſt precious treaſure, that a man will part with any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe tearmes. The ſaving of his life. That all a man ſuffers comes not very neare him, while that is out of danger.</hi> Such is the generall ſenſe, and Satans intendment in ſpeaking this, is as cleare; namely, that as <hi>Iob</hi> before had ſerved God for his wealth, ſo now he doth ſerve him for his breath; that as before <hi>Iob</hi> kept cloſe to God, that hee might enrich him: ſo now <hi>Iob</hi> keepes cloſe to God, leſt he ſhould deſtroy him. He ſeemeth to hold faſt his <hi>integrity</hi> (ſo you tell me) but it is onely that he may hold faſt his life; He ſerved you before for wealth, and now he ſerves you for breath. His feare of looſing that makes him humble himſelfe, and give many thankes: Search him to the bottome and you will find him ſtill a mercenary ſervant, holding his integrity that hee may hold in with thee, and live. This is the generall drift of Satan.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:98733:125"/>But to give the ſpeciall meaning of his words doth ſomewhat trouble Interpreters, <hi>Skin for skin and all that a man hath will hee give for his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt [<hi>Skin for skin</hi>] Some interpret it thus, A man will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the skin of one member to ſave the skin of another: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut-off or wounded, his life is more in danger. As for inſtance, if a blow come at a mans head, he will hold up his hand or his naked arme, he will venture the skin of his hand to ſave his head. And the reaſon is, becauſe his life is more in danger, if he be wounded in his head, then in his hand. Here is <hi>skin for skin,</hi> he gives the skin of a member, which is further off from the ſeat of life, to ſave the skin of that member which is ſo neare the ſeat of life.</p>

As a godly man will give life upon life, a thouſand lives (if he had them) rather then looſe his ſoule: So a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man will give skin upon skin, gold upon gold, treaſure upon trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he may ſave his life. Let life lie at the ſtake, and a man will give all things he hath in the world for it, and thinke he hath a good bargaine.</p>
               <p>Here are 5. expoſitions you ſee offered: The two latter to me ſeeme the moſt cleare, howſoever every one of them hath a faire ſenſe in it; and ſo we are agreed upon the generall, which is onely to ſet forth the excellency and preciouſneſſe of life, there cannot be any miſcarriage in pitching upon either of theſe Interpretations. I ſhall give you ſome notes from hence.</p>
               <p>Firſt obſerve what a bleſſing life is. <hi>Skin for skin and all that a man hath will he give for his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Life is the most precious treaſure, the moſt excellent thing in nature.</hi> And let me tell you life is the treaſure, that is now ſo much digged for: there are many abroad that are digging for your preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lives: Conſider what lyes at ſtake, and what will you give for
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98733:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſecuring or reducing of it. Have we not cauſe to ſay of ſome of our bloody brethren, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.12. when his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eſau</hi> was marching towards him, <hi>I feare him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leaſt he will come and ſlay me and the mother with the children</hi>; Loſſe of life was the thing <hi>Jacob</hi> feared. And <hi>Heſters</hi> ſpeech in her petition to the King, imports that all other loſſes might have been borne, but loſſe of life, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Let my life</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>be given at my Petition, and my people at my requeſt, for we are ſold I and my people to be deſtroyed, to be ſlaine and to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: But if we had been ſold for bond-men and for bond-women, I had held my tongue.</hi> See how ſhe wrought for life, for her own life and the life of her people, and thought liberty not worth the asking for, compared with life. <hi>Moſes</hi> made many demurrs and excuſes, <hi>I am not eloquent,</hi> &amp;c. when God gave him Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to goe into <hi>Aegypt</hi>; but we heare of no delayes at all, when once God had ſaid, <hi>Returne into</hi> Egypt, <hi>for all the men are dead, which ſought thy life, Exod.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 19. God had not ſpoken thus, if he had not knowne there was ſuch a ſcruple in his mind, which would have galled him worſe in his travels to <hi>Egypt</hi> then any peble in his ſhoe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If life be the moſt precious thing, the richeſt jewell in the world: then in the next place, learne to value your lives. You ſee how Satan values life here, out of an ill intent, only to extenuate and undervalue all the ſufferings of <hi>Job</hi>; he ſets his life at a very high rate, that he might make all his loſſes of no rate, not worth the ſpeaking off. Let our intent be good, and then it is good for us to value our lives high, and to ſell them at as deare a rate, as we can, if we muſt ſell them. You know what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith in the perſon of a naturall man, <hi>A living dog is better then a dead Lion,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.4. We reade what is ſaid of the woman in the Goſpell, that had <hi>spent all ſhe had upon Phyſitians.</hi> What was it for? Onely to reſtore her health, which is a degree below life. Certainly if ſhe ſpent all that ſhe had to obtaine health, which is onely the comfort of life, ſhall not we ſpend a part of that we have to ſave our lives. As ſhips in danger to be wrack'd in a ſtorme, are often preſerved by caſting ſome of their rich lading into the Sea. So it is poſſible, yea probable that the caſting away of ſome of your eſtates in this great ſtorme, may be a meanes to ſave both your ſhip and your lives; your eſtates kept may ſinke the veſſell, and then you muſt ſinke with it, and certainly die or ſwim from it, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98733:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hardly live. When <hi>Eſau</hi> (Gen. 25.32.) was hungry and could not obtaine a meſſe of pottage from his brother, but upon very hard tearmes, the ſale of his birth-right, <hi>Sell me thy birth-right,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob,</hi> a precious jewell indeed, which <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued more then his life; but he comes to his price on this ground, <hi>Behold I am at the point to die, and what profit ſhall this birth-right doe to me?</hi> He was <hi>prophane Eſau</hi> for ſaying ſo, that's the Apoſtles ſtile, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. It was profaneneſſe to preferre one morſell of meat before his birth-right; becauſe the birth-right was a ſpirituall priviledge as well as a naturall: but there is no meere naturall bleſſing, but we may both in wiſdome and conſcience part with to keepe our lives; when yee are ready to die, yee may ſay, what will this eſtate, theſe riches doe us good? If that, your eſtates may be the price of your lives, yee have reaſon and it is your duty to part with them willingly; give ſome, give all, for what will theſe riches do you good, when you are ready to die, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dead.</p>
               <p>Further be ready to give more than your eſtates, for your lives. Give ſome of your bloud for your lives, that's more, <hi>Skin for skin and all that a man hath will he give for his life:</hi> and which is yet more, give a limbe for your lives. The whole is better then a part: And which is higheſt of all, venture your lives to ſave your lives. That which I intend is only this, doe not barter away your lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on meane rates, upon low tearmes. If it comes to it (as wee have great cauſe to feare it will, we ſee many have been put to it already) ſell your lives as deare as you can. Indeed there are none in ſo great danger to looſe their lives, as they that will not venture their lives. That of Chriſt is true in this ſenſe alſo, he that will ſave his life ſhall looſe it; ſuch ſaving tends to undoing, yea it tends to death. And whoſoever will (venture to) looſe his life, ſhall (moſt probably) find it, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.25. Let it not be ſaid that you died to ſave charges, let it not be ſaid that you died to ſave your skins, or to ſave your bloud, yea let it not be ſaid that you died to ſave your lives, I meane that you feared to hazard your lives for the ſecuring of your lives. Give all that you have for your lives, venture life and all; your ſafety depends upon this hazard, by ſuch a noble liberality, you are in the faireſt way, not only to ſave all you have, but to gain more then you have.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If your lives be ſo much worth, what are your ſoules worth? What is this life, which is valued thus above all that a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98733:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man hath? The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> makes the queſtion, and gives the anſwer, <hi>It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away,</hi> Jam. 4.14. a mans breath it is but in his noſtrils, it is gone preſently, yet you ſee in a true value all the world is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that. If you are to eſteeme your lives ſo, at what price will you ſet your ſoules? To ſave your lives and ſave your ſoules are two things. A man may ſave his life and yet looſe his ſoule; yea many labour to ſave their lives in doing that, which will be the loſſe of their ſoules, poore creatures! Therefore looke to that, ſet a high rate indeed upon your immortal ſoules; when eſtates and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and lives are called for, count them all as traſh, that you may ſave your ſoules, hazard not your ſoules: If life be more worth then all the world, the ſoule is more worth then a thouſand lives, <hi>What will it advantage a man to gaine the world and looſe his ſoule? Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoule?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16.26.</note> The truth is a man ſhould not gaine much to get the whole world and looſe his life, that loſſe is a loſſe irreparable, irrecompenſible from the creature. <hi>Nature teacheth us to prize our lives above the world, and grace teacheth us to value our ſoules above our lives.</hi> Therefore how unnaturall are they that preferre a little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit before their lives; but O how ungracious are they, who preferre a little profit before their ſoules! Some will ſinne (as we ſay) for ſix-pence, ſelling their owne ſoules (as thoſe falſe Prophets did the ſoules of their people) <hi>for hand-fulls of barley, and for pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of bread,</hi> Ezek. 13.19. And whereas a man ſhould give all for his life, they will give their ſoules for a thing of nought. Know therefore the worth of your ſoules. Jeſus Chriſt thought ſoules worth his life, and therefore dyed to ſave ſoules. How much then doe our ſoules tranſcend our owne lives? And if Chriſt laid downe his life to ranſome ſoules, doe you rather lay downe a thouſand lives (if you had them) then indanger your ſoules, either by acting ſinne or by ſubmitting unto errour. In that caſe let eſtate goe, let liberty goe, let life, let all goe, for life hath not ſo much preheminence over all, as the ſoule hath over life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If your lives are worth ſo much, then what is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell worth? If a man would give all for his life, what ſhould he give for his Religion, to maintaine and uphold that in the purity and power of it? Life is a precious thing, a thing of great value, but when the Goſpell comes in competition, then life is a poore
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:98733:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
commodity; and our breath but a periſhing vapour. Such was the judgement of that great Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.24. when the Holy Ghoſt <hi>had witneſſed in every City, that bonds and afflictions did abide him,</hi> in preaching the Goſpell, he thus reſolves, <hi>But none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life deare unto my ſelfe, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the ministery which I have received to teſtifie the Goſpell of the grace of God.</hi> His life came to a low rate in his eſteeme, how cheape was life when the Goſpell was ſpoken of, <hi>I count not my life deare,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> as all other outward things are meane and low compared with life; ſo life it ſelfe is a meane, a low thing in compariſon of the Goſpell. This life is but the life of the body, but the Goſpell is the life of the ſoule. Many men live, but no ſoule lives on this ſide or without the Goſpell. Now if you will offer much to ſave your lives, will not you offer much more to ſave the Goſpell? In and about this we may make the beſt improvement of Satans argument, <hi>Skin for skin and all that a man hath, ſhould he give for the Gospell,</hi> for Goſpell ordinances, for Goſpell priviledges, for Goſpell light. Where, or for what will you venture and bid high, if not for the precious Goſpell?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If life be worth all; then hereby we may take meaſure of the love and bounty of Chriſt to poore ſinners, who not onely ſpent himſelfe in all to his life, but ſpent life and all, that they might not periſh; the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was exceeding great towards us, <hi>That though he was rich, yet for our ſakes he became poore,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9. <hi>That though he was in the forme of God, and thought it no robbery to be equall with God, yet he made himſelfe of no reputation,</hi> Phil. 2.6, 7. But how ſuperabundant was his grace towards us, that though he was the <hi>Prince of life,</hi> Act. 3.15. <hi>Yet became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſſe,</hi> Phil. 2.8. <hi>that we might live.</hi> If a man loves his life, ſo that he will <hi>give skin for skin, and all that he hath,</hi> to redeeme it, then O how did Chriſt love his Church, who gave not only his riches, and his reputation, but his life alſo for it's redemption!</p>

               <p>IN this fifth <hi>verſe</hi> Satan goeth on, and makes a motion unto God (as we obſerved his method in the former Chapter,) <hi>but put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> This is Satans motion. In the ſixth <hi>verſe</hi> we have a grant of this motion, bound up yet with a limitation, as it was in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>For the motion, <hi>But put forth thine hand now and touch,</hi> &amp;c. What it importeth <hi>to put forth the hand,</hi> that was opened in the former Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. where we have the ſame expreſſion, therefore we ſhall not ſtay upon it here. Conſider now only that which is differing, a new object upon which the hand muſt be put forth, and which Satan deſireth might now be touched. It is the laying of his hand, not upon his Cattell, or upon his eſtate, or upon his children, but upon his fleſh and his bone, <hi>Touch his bone and his fleſh</hi>; that is, afflict his body; The <hi>bone</hi> and the <hi>fleſh</hi> are the two chiefe parts, the materiall parts of the body; of them the whole Fabrique doth conſiſt: the bone it is as the timber in this houſe, and the fleſh it is as the lime and morter filling of it up. Touch this ſaith Satan. And in that he ſaith, <hi>touch his bone and his fleſh,</hi> he intends and requires a deepe and a ſore affliction upon his body; for if he had ſaid only thus, <hi>Touch his fleſh,</hi> that had beene an affliction upon his body; For we know often in Scripture, the <hi>fleſh</hi> is put for the whole body; and ſometimes for the whole man; therefore Satan is not ſatisfied with an expreſſion generall, but he putteth it in direct and expreſſe termes, <hi>Touch his fleſh and his bone,</hi> that is, touch him ſo as that the paine and the diſtemper may
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98733:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſinke into his very bones, into his very Marrow, touch him thus and then you ſhall ſee what he will doe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bone</hi> it ſelfe is a part without feeling; yet to touch the <hi>bone,</hi> imports the greateſt paine that can be felt. <hi>Touch his bone and his fleſh,</hi> and then ſaith he,
<q>He will curſe thee to thy face.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What it is <hi>to curſe to the face</hi> hath bin opened already in the former Chapter, at the eleventh <hi>verſe,</hi> and I muſt referre you thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the ſence of this phraſe; only in a word take it thus, <hi>Hee will curſe thee to thy face,</hi> is as if Satan had ſaid thus; Though <hi>Job</hi> did bleſſe thee when he had a full eſtate, and though he did bleſſe thee when thou diddeſt empty him of his eſtate, and tooke all his goods from him; yet if thou doe but touch his body, and afflict his bones, he will breake forth into curſed language, both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thy perſon, and concerning thy ſervice.</p>
               <p>I will only minde you further of that which is here ſecretly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in this expreſſion, <hi>Touch his bone and his fleſh and he will curſe thee to thy face</hi>; here is a ſecret imprecation involved, he tacitly ſubjects himſelfe to the curſe of God, if <hi>Job</hi> curſe not God. As if Satan ſhould have ſaid; If he doe not <hi>curſe thee to thy face,</hi> then doe ſo and ſo to me, or thinke thus and thus of me: If you would have the meaning of Satan from the language of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you may take the plaine <hi>Engliſh</hi> of it thus, <hi>Touch but his bone and his fleſh,</hi> and damne me, if he doe not curſe thee, ſend me to Hell preſently. Satan indeed kept this curſed imprecation cloſe wrapt up in that forme of ſpeaking; But now his children ſpeake it out; If you will have Satans heart from the mouthes of the ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> a curſed and curſing generation among us, the plaine <hi>Engliſh</hi> of it is this. God damne me, ſend me to Hell preſently, if he curſe thee not. Satan we ſee was more modeſt then theſe ſonnes of impudence and perdition; who openly imprecate upon, and devote themſelves unto the wrath of God almoſt every word; theſe doe not only imitate, but exceed the copy which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſets them here, by bold blaſphemie and horrid execrations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> We may from hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Satan had tryed in vaine to make <hi>Job</hi> curſe God; Now he attempts a ſecond time; Note, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When Satan cannot prevaile againſt us by one meanes, he doth
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98733:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not deſpaire of prevailing by another</hi>; He gives not his cauſe over for loſt, becauſe he cannot carry it at firſt, he will try, and try a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. As it was with <hi>Balak, Numb.</hi> 23. when he ſent for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> to curſe the people, and ſaw the buſineſſe did not proſper, or ſucceed according to his malice, <hi>Balaam could not curſe them,</hi> he brought him to another place; <hi>Come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I pray thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 23.27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I will bring thee to another place, peradventure it will pleaſe God that thou mayeſt curſe me them from thence,</hi> though you could not doe it in one place, you may in another. So Satan, if he cannot worke his will one way, he will try a ſecond or a third.</p>
               <p>Satans unweariedneſſe in a bad cauſe when it ſucceeded not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves thoſe who are ſo ſoone weary of a good one, if it ſucceed not; Many are ready to give up if one meanes will not doe it, they caſt off hope and ſay, the cauſe is deſperate. If one, or two, or three, or many meanes we uſe, faile, we ought to try ſtill, never deſpaire of the end while the worke is good and the meanes are faire; <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed</hi> (ſaith the Preacher) <hi>and in the evening with-hold not thy hand:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.6.</note> 
                  <hi>for thou knowest not whether ſhall proſper this or that.</hi> I may adde, with-hold not thy hand in the evening, though thou ſeeſt the morning ſeed doth not proſper; this may have a bleſſing, though that had not.</p>
               <p>Secondly obſerve, Satan tryeth another way, and he tryeth a way more probable and efficacious for his ends then the former; when a weaker will not doe it, he provides ſtronger meanes. As God in puniſhing or chaſtening ſinners, when a leſſer judgement will not humble them, he ſends a greater; God cometh not only with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but with ſorer judgements;<note place="margin">Lev 26.</note> 
                  <hi>If he will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will puniſh you ſeven times more for your ſinnes:</hi> So Satan, when by one temptation he cannot over-come, prepares not only another, but a ſtronger; he aſſaults them more and more; he not only muſters new Forces, but more compleate, to foile the ſoule. This ſhould teach us when we cannot ſubdue a corruption in our own hearts by one meanes, then to ſeeke a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And when by one prayer we cannot obtaine a bleſſing, then to pray againe, and to pray better, to pray with more life, with more faith, with more humility: then mix more fire with prayer, more zeale and fervency of ſpirit: mix more water with prayer, As <hi>Iacob, Hoſe</hi> 12. wept and made ſupplication; above all mix more of Chriſt in prayer, goe out in his Name and ſtrength. When <hi>Balacks</hi> firſt meſſengers could not obtaine <hi>Balaam</hi> to come
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:98733:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with them; <hi>Balack</hi> was not diſcourag'd or put off, but (ſaith the Text) Balack <hi>ſent yet againe Princes more and more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi> Numb. 22.15. Let not us be diſcouraged if our firſt prayers (which are our meſſengers to God) are not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; But let us ſend more and more honourable, more ſtrong cryes, more ſpirituall deſires, which may take upon the heart of God. Why ſhould Satan doe more againſt us, then we will doe for our ſelves?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Note for our owne caution; That we muſt not only expect continued or renewed afflictions and aſſaults from Satan, but we muſt expect greater and greater afflictions and aſſaults from Satan. He hath ſome aſſaults that are but as Foote-men, he will bring out his Horſe-men at the next bout; <hi>And if having runne with Foote-men, they have wearied thee, how wilt thou contend with Horſes,</hi> Jer. 12.5. Be ready then not only to run with the Foote, but to contend with Horſes; prepare your ſelves for other, for more violent charges then you ever felt. Satan will if he can lay a cloſer ſiege to thy ſoule then ever he hath done: As that one evill ſpirit returned into the perſon out of whom he was gone, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.24. <hi>with ſeven Devils worſe then himſelfe,</hi> ſo he often returnes with ſeven temptations, worſer, ſtronger then before.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, obſerve what Satan picks out to be the matter of this ſecond and ſtronger temptation, it is, to pinch <hi>Job</hi> in his fleſh, to pinch his body. Note from hence, <hi>That the paine of the body is very powerfull to diſquiet and trouble the mind.</hi> Satan is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident to trouble and vex the mind of <hi>Job,</hi> by caſting darts and diſeaſes into his body. Phyſitians have a rule, <hi>That the manners of the mind follow the temper of the body,</hi> and it is a more certaine rule, <hi>That the mind is much carried according to the distemper of the body,</hi> when the body is diſtempered, the mind is ſeldome at reſt: the body and ſoule are ſuch neere neighbours, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſympathize in each others ſufferings. Some interpret that place of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.13, 14. concerning the weakeneſſe and ſickneſſe of his body, <hi>You know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how through infirmity of the fleſh I preached the Goſpell:</hi> We may ſafely joyne it with thoſe other troubles, afflictions and reproaches which he endured, and were ſo great a diſadvantage to his acceptance in the world. So the meaning is, that though his body was infirme, though he had many weakeneſſes upon him, yet he preached the Goſpell. And then it followes in the next verſe, <hi>My temptation which was
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98733:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in my fleſh you deſpiſed not,</hi> obſerve, he calleth his bodily infirmity a temptation; The afflictions of the body are great temptations to the ſoule. It is very conſiderable to this purpoſe what the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith when he ſpeaks of the ſeverall conditions of the Saints and their duties in them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Is any man afflicted? let him pray,</hi> (he ſpeakes that in generall) <hi>Is any man merry? let him ſing Pſalmes. Is any man ſick?</hi> Is he pained by ſickneſſe in his body? What ſhall he doe then? He doth not ſay, <hi>Is any man ſick,</hi> let him pray? but, <hi>Is any man ſick? let him call for the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, and let them pray over him:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, A ſick man is very unfit to pray himſelfe, though for himſelfe, he hath need to call others to pray with him and for him, he hath enough to doe, to wraſtle with his pain and conflict with that affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: In other afflictions let him pray, but if he be ſick, let him ſend for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him. A diſeaſed body unfits the mind for holy duties. The prayer of ſick <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is called <hi>chattering: like a Crane or Swallow, ſo did I chatter,</hi> Iſa. 38. it was rather chattering then praying, ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe and uncompoſedneſſe was upon his ſpirit thorough, or by the infirmity of his fleſh. Paine is a piercing ſhaft in Satans qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of temptations; Though <hi>the spirit of a man will ſuſtaine his infirmity,</hi> yet oftentimes, a wound in the body wounds the ſoule,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.14.</note> and the diſeaſes of the fleſh make the ſpirit ſick: <hi>A wounded spirit no man can beare,</hi> and a wound in the body, is a burden too heavy for many men.</p>
               <p>And if it be ſo, Then the pain and the weakneſſe of the body is no advantage to repentance and returning unto God. How pittifully are they miſtaken, who put off repentance till their bodies be in paine, till they are ſick and weake; they doe it upon this ground, becauſe when they are in paine, they thinke they ſhall repent with more eaſe. Obſerve, if Satan thinks to have ſuch an advantage upon a holy man, as to make him blaſpheme when he is in paine, doeſt thou thinke paine will be an advantage to thy repentance? It is ſaid, that at the <hi>powring out of the fourth Viall,</hi> Rev. 16.9. when God did ſmite the inhabitants of the earth, and ſcorched them with great heat, that <hi>they blaſphemed the Name of God,</hi> (they did that which Satan preſumed <hi>Job</hi> would doe) <hi>and they repented not to give him glory.</hi> It is a woefull thing to put off repentance to a pained body: paine in its own nature fits us rather to blaſpheme and turne from God, then to returne to him. Never thinke to

have helpe for the cure of your ſoules, by the diſeaſes of your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: uſually we find, that either ſick perſons repent not, or theirs is but a ſickly repentance. At the moſt, paine can but reſtraine your luſts, it can never heale them, The actings of ſome ſins are quickned by diſeaſes; At the moſt, a diſeaſe can but abate the acts of ſin, it can never deſtroy the life of it. Death it ſelfe cannot kill ſin: The ſins of wicked men live when they are dead: the grave cannot conſume them, no nor the fire of Hell waſt their ſtrength: the ſins of unbeleevers ſhall remaine not only in their guilt, but in their power to all eternity. So much of Satans motion. <hi>But put forth thy hand now and touch his bone and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi>

We know the Lord is able to ſtrike ſtronger ſtroakes, and give deeper wounds infinitely then Satan can, if he pleaſeth; yet, the love of God to his children, ſtops his hand and breakes the blow: He corrects in judgement, and debates in meaſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.8. when he ſtrikes his children, he ſtrikes them as children, gently; Thus (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14.) ſpeaking of <hi>Davids</hi> family; <hi>If he commit iniquity</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will chasten him with the rod of men,</hi> the word there uſed is <hi>Enoſh,</hi> which ſignifies a weake man, I will chaſten him with the rod of a weake man, of one that hath but a weake arme or hand, the hand of a ſickly fraile man; A weake, a ſickly man cannot ſtrike very hard.

               <p>Here is Satans chaine, the limitation or reſtraint of his power. When God puts any of his ſervants into Satans hand, he keepes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in his owne hand.

               <p>Obſerve then, <hi>That here to ſave life, notes only a ſparing from death,</hi> not a delivering from deſtruction, but a forbearing to deſtroy. Satan ſaved his life negatively,<note place="margin">

               <p>It may be queſtioned here, Why Satan (for that is implyed) deſired ſo to deſtroy the life of <hi>Job?</hi> God would never have limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and chained him up, but that Satan had a mind to ſuck his blood, or afflict him unto death.</p>
               <p>Theſe two reaſons may be given, why Satan would have his life.</p>
               <p>The one might be this, Becauſe it was a thing doubtfull with him (though he bragged much of it) whether he ſhould attaine his end or no, to make <hi>Job</hi> curſe God; when therefore he ſaw he could not overcome his ſpirituall life, it would have bin ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge to him to deſtroy his naturall life.

                  </gap> againſt his naturall life, to deſtroy that; This is the method of perſecution, firſt to attempt the death of the ſoule, by drawing or terrifying unto ſin; and if they faile of that, then death is infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on the body.</p>
               <p>Or againe in the ſecond place, he being doubtfull in himſelfe (though he made no doubt in words) whether his plot would be ſucceſſefull, to make <hi>Job</hi> curſe God; he (I ſay) doubting this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne might not draw him to ſin, reſolved to take away his life, that ſo <hi>Job</hi> might never have told tales of his victory, or have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his conqueſt to the world. At leaſt by his death he might obſcure the buſineſſe, and bury it with ſome ſlander: ſaying that <hi>Job</hi> died with diſcontent and griefe, that he blaſphemed God when he died, that he wiſhed for death, and could not hold out any longer. Much like that device of ſome Jeſuits, who have blowne it abroad, that our moſt zealous oppoſers of Romiſh errours,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98733:132"/>
whom they could never move, either by writing or diſputing, while they lived, have yet recanted all when they dyed. Wherefore leaſt Satan ſhould have drawen a curtain over the glory of <hi>Jobs</hi> victory, by aſperſing him after his death, the Lord ſaith, <hi>Save his life, Job</hi> ſhall ſurvive his troubles, that matters may come to light, and a true report be made and left upon record both of thy implacable malice, and enmity, and of his invincible patience and ſincerity.</p>
               <p>And this may lead us yet further to conſider, why God was ſo carefull of that precious part, his life.</p>
               <p>For ſome may ſay,</p>
               <p>Had it not been glory to God and honour to <hi>Job,</hi> (like that of Martyrdome,) if he had died under the hand of Satan, holding faſt his own integrity, bleſſing God even unto death?</p>
               <p>I grant this, but yet God knew that the ſaving of his life would be more advantagious both to himſelfe and his <hi>Job,</hi> for thoſe ends: wherefore he ſaith, <hi>Save his life,</hi> deſtroy him not.</p>
               <p>Firſt thus, God intended to make <hi>Job</hi> a <hi>Monument of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> as well as a <hi>Monument of ſuffering,</hi> he intended to ſet him up to all the world as one, in whom they might behold the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God in raiſing up, mixt with his wiſdome in caſting down; that men might learn hope from <hi>Job,</hi> as well as patience from <hi>Job.</hi> Therefore ſaith God, <hi>Save his life,</hi> I have ſomewhat elſe to do with him; I will raiſe him up again, and in him an everlaſting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of his patience in ſuffering, and of my own power in reſtoring. Indeed if he had died in the conflict and left his bones in the field, he had been a wonderfull example of conſtancy: but he had not been ſuch an example of mercy, if his life had not been ſaved.</p>
               <p>There may be this in it too, <hi>Save his life,</hi> ſaith God, I will have him preſerved in this combate, his courage and carriage in it is my delight. God loveth to ſee his people holding out, tugging and continuing in ſuch aſſaults and temptations.<note place="margin">

ſome great calamitie: to ſee a poor man, man who is but fleſh and bloud wraſtling with principalities and powers, with the devill and powers of darkneſſe; this is a ſight that God himſelf (as we may ſo ſpeak) rejoyceth in.<note place="margin">Gen. 22.14.</note> When <hi>Abraham</hi> had finiſhed that great combate about ſacrificing his ſonne, he calleth the place <hi>Jehovah-jireh,</hi> the Lord will ſee, or the Lord doth ſee, the Lord doth behold; as if that had been a ſight which God himſelfe came down to look upon.

To ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> in that great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſſaulted and overcomming. Here was a ſpectacle for the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and therefore he cals the place <hi>Jehovah-jireh,</hi> the Lord hath ſeen. I doubt not but this place alſo of <hi>Jobs</hi> triall, might have born the ſame name. As the Lord will be ſeen in the mount of our afflictions to provide for us, ſo he will ſee us in the mount of our afflictions, to pleaſe himſelf. The Pſalmiſt deſcribeth <hi>God look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down from heaven upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did understand, that did ſeek God, Pſal.</hi> 53.2. Surely then if any do ſeek God, much more if they ſuffer from him, or for him in a holy manner, he will look downe from Heaven to ſee them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I will note that as another ground why God would have his life ſpared, becauſe he had much uſe of him, when he was in that condition, full of ſores and ſcabs. <hi>A godly man is never in ſuch an estate but God hath ſome uſe of his life.</hi> Therefore ſaith God, <hi>Save his life,</hi> though he be full of ſores, or rather from the crown of the head to the ſole of the foot one continued ſore: though he be a moſt lamentable creature, and cannot wag hand or foot in any ſervice of man, yet ſpare his life, for he may thus ſtand me in great ſtead, and do me more ſervice then many thouſands, who (as we ſpeake) are ſound winde and limbe, and have not one blemiſh upon the whole body. <hi>A godly perſon is ever uſefull to God,</hi> though he cannot ſtirre a limbe, yet his life may be uſefull to God: whereas a wicked man, though ſtrong and healthy, though furniſht with outward comforts and accommodations, is altogether unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable; he will not doe God a ſtroake of worke, though he have received great pay and wages afore-hand. A godly man will ſerve God in and by his poverty, in and by his ſickneſſe, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, when diſtreſſed, when nothing is to be ſeen upon him but ſcabs and boiles. Grace will work through all the defects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98733:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of nature. And when the life of nature can ſcarce move one member of the outward man upon the earth, the life of grace moves all the members of the inward man toward Heaven. <hi>Though the outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.16.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, God ſaved his life, as a puniſhment and vexation upon Satan. The <hi>Talmudists</hi> are vouched to affirme, that it was not ſo grievous to <hi>Job,</hi> to be afflicted in his body, as it was to Satan when God reſtrained him from deſtroying his life. As if a man ſhould be permitted to crack the glaſſe, but he muſt not ſpill the wine. That his life muſt be kept whole in him, was Satans wound. It is a torture to malice not to do the utmoſt miſchiefe. So much for the clearing of theſe words, <hi>Behold, he is in thine hand, but ſave his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the Lords grant obſerve firſt, <hi>That God doth oftentimes give up the bodies of his faithfull ſervants to be abuſed and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by Satan and his inſtruments. He is in thine hand, thou maiest do with him what thou wilt,</hi> on this ſide death. Touch his fleſh and his bone, or touch his fleſh to the bone, ſtrike as hard, wound as deep as thou canſt. It is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.10. <hi>that Satan ſhould caſt ſome of them,</hi> that is, of the ſervants of God, <hi>into priſon.</hi> God gave up their bodies to irons, and fetters, to the ſtocks and ſhackles: He permits thoſe bodies which are Temples of the holy Ghoſt, to be thruſt into dungeons and the chambers of death.</p>
               <p>Therefore doe not thinke it ſtrange to ſee the bodies of the children of God put into cruell and bloudy hands, though they are veſſels of honour and Temples of the holy Ghoſt, yet God may give up thoſe bodies to be defiled and polluted with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of the moſt abominable wretches; conſider what the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the Jewiſh Martyrs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. How were their bodies abuſed and mangled? <hi>They were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, they were ſlaine with the ſword: they wandered about in ſheep skins and goat skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented: of whom the world was not worthy:</hi> Their bodies had not a houſe to dwell in, nor garments to put on, in whoſe ſoules God himſelfe dwelt, and had put upon them the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Salvation. Who is able to expreſſe, yea, to conceive what ſtrange inventions of crueltie have been brought into the world to vex and torment the bodies of the Saints; The ſtories of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times are full: but the fathers of the Romiſh inquiſition have exceeded them all. Satan here invents a ſtrange diſeaſe as an

engine to torture <hi>Jobs</hi> body, in that he mixt the rack, and the wheel, the ſword and the ſaw, the fiery gridiron and the boyling oil: The pain of a thouſand deaths was heightn'd in that malignant diſtemper.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>he is in thine hand, but ſave his life,</hi> ſaith God. The matter wherein Satan is limited is life, then note</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That life and death are in the hand of God.</hi> It is truth, that all we have is in the hand of God; but God keeps our life in his hand laſt of all, and he hath that in his hand in a ſpeciall manner. So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> expreſſes it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 66.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou holdest my ſoul in life</hi>; though the ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, life may not continue, there is the ſoul, when there is not life, life is that which is the union of ſoul and body, <hi>Thou holdest my ſoul in life,</hi> that is, thou holdeſt ſoul and body together. So <hi>Daniel</hi> deſcribes God to <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> Dan. 5.23. <hi>The God in whoſe hand thy breath is, and whoſe are all thy wayes haſt thou not glorified.</hi> The breath of Princes is in the hand of God; and the ſame hand holds the breath of the meaneſt ſubject. This may be matter of comfort to us in ſuch times as theſe are, times of danger, and times of death; when the hand of man is lifted up to take thy life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy life is held in the hand of God. And as God ſaid here to Satan, Afflict the body of <hi>Job,</hi> but ſave his life; ſo God ſaith ſtill to bloudy wretches, who are as the limbs of Satan, The bodies of ſuch and ſuch are in your hands, the eſtates of ſuch and ſuch are in your hands, but ſave their lives. The life of a man is never at the mercy of a creature, though it be a common ſpeech of men, when they have a man under them, <hi>Now I have you at my mercy</hi>; though ſome brag as <hi>Laban</hi> did to <hi>Jacob, It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt:</hi> yet God often checks them (as he did <hi>Laban</hi>) from ſo much as ſpeaking hurt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.29. <hi>but the God of your father ſpake unto me yeſter-night, ſaying, Take thou heed, that thou ſpeak not to Jacob either good or bad.</hi> Creatures though full of love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak good, and though full of malice they cannot ſpeak bad, if God forbid: then much leſſe can they do us hurt, and leaſt of all hurt our lives, if God with-hold. <hi>David</hi> triumphs in his intereſt in ſuch a God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.20. <hi>Our God is the God of ſalvation</hi> (that is of deliverance, of outward deliverance (for that is eſpecially there meant) <hi>and unto God the Lord belong the iſſues from death,</hi> or the goings out from death, that is, God hath all wayes that lead out from death in his own keeping, he keepeth the key of the door, that lets us out from death; when a man is in the valley of the ſhadow
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98733:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of death, where ſhall he iſſue out? where ſhall he have a paſſage? No where, ſaith man, he ſhall not eſcape; but God keepeth all the paſſages, when men think they have ſhut us up in the jawes of death, he can open them, and deliver us. <hi>To him belong the iſſues from death</hi>; It is an alluſion to one that keepeth a paſſage or a door: And God is a faithfull keeper, and a friendly keeper, who will open the door for the eſcape of his people, when they cry unto him. It is expreſt ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.7. <hi>Our bones are ſcattered at the graves mouth: as when one cutteth or cleaveth wood upon the earth</hi>; that is, we are even ready to die, to be put into the grave. What then? <hi>But mine eyes are upon thee, O God the Lord: in thee is my truſt, leave not my ſoul destitute. Keep me from the ſnare which they have laid for me. Let the wicked fall into their own nets: whileſt I withall eſcape,</hi> that is, make me a way to eſcape; As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Thou haſt the key of the gate</hi> by which we may iſſue out from death: Lord, I look that thou ſhouldeſt now open it for me.</p>
               <p>Let it comfort us that God hath our lives, and the iſſues from death in his own hand. When Satan thought he had <hi>Job</hi> faſt enough lockt up in the valley of the ſhadow of death, God kept him ſafe, he opened a door and let him out.</p>
               <p>Thirdly note, that as God hath life in his hand in a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo he takes ſpeciall care of the lives of his people. <hi>Save his life</hi> (ſaith God) I will look to that: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.15. <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his ſaints</hi>; Precious is their death; not that death it ſelf is precious, a privation hath no preciouſneſſe in it: but their life is precious, therefore he will have a great price for their death; God puts off the life of a Saint at a deare rate. Woe unto thoſe who violently and unjuſtly take away that which is ſo precious in the eſteeme of God, at one time or other he will make them pay dear for ſuch Jewels.</p>
               <p>Fourthly obſerve, <hi>It is mercy to have our lives, though we loſe all things elſe.</hi> You ſee here God ſaith concerning <hi>Job, Save his life.</hi> I have given thee his eſtate, thou haſt ſpoiled that, now I will leave his body in thine hand, wound that, afflict that, but ſave his life. Here was mercy. Therefore it was a ſpeciall promiſe and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge made and granted to ſome in times of great publike ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and common calamities, as to <hi>Ebed-melech</hi> the Ethiopian, <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.18. and to <hi>Baruch</hi> the Scribe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 45.5. <hi>that their lives ſhould be given to them for a prey</hi>; as if God had ſaid, It is no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:98733:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
favour in times of common danger to have your lives for a prey; you complain for this loſſe and that loſſe, and you have cauſe too, but think withall that you have your lives. And why is it ſaid, that they ſhould have their lives for a prey? A prey you know properly is that which we take out of the hand of an enemie, that which was in his poſſeſſion; the lives of theſe perſons were ſaid to be given to them for a prey, in thoſe perillous times, becauſe God by his care and providence did (as it were) fetch back their lives from the hand of the enemie: their lives in naturall reaſon were in their enemies hands, but God undertakes to fetch them back, and recover them out of their hands, and ſo they were promiſed to have their lives for a prey. Thus God giveth to many of his people their lives for a prey, and they are to bleſſe God in this behalfe, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver afflictions and troubles are upon them, that yet they have their lives.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may hence raiſe our meditations to conſider the wonderfull love of God to us in Chriſt: when God ſent Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to ſave ſinners, he put him into the hands of Satan and his inſtruments; yet he doth not ſay (as here) to Satan, <hi>Save his life</hi>; Afflict him as thou wilt, perſecute him in his cradle, deſpiſe him, ſlander him, revile him, accuſe him, crowne his head with thornes, ſcourge him, buffet him, ſpit in his face, &amp;c. <hi>but ſave his life</hi>; No, this bound is not ſet to the malice of Satan or the rage of men, God gives them leave to take life and all. Concerning his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Job,</hi> God ſaith to Satan, Spare his life; but when he ſendeth his Son, he gives no order to have him ſpared, but gives his cruell enemies full ſcope. How wonderfull is the love of God, who for our ſakes was ſo expenſive of his Sons life; when as he thus ſpared the life of a ſervant. If Satan had been chained up from taking the life of Chriſt, he had been at liberty to triumph over our lives, to all eternity. We had all died, if God had ſaid to Satan concerning Chriſt, Save his life.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the Commiſſion of Satan againſt <hi>Job,</hi> and the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it. Satan was not tyed up ſo ſhort as he was in the former Chapter, and yet ſtill he is tyed. There he might meddle with <hi>Jobs</hi> eſtate, but not with his body; here he may meddle with his body, but not with his life: Though God lengthen Satans chain, yet he never lets Satan looſe, though he be at more liberty then before, yet he is in cuſtody, there is a <hi>But</hi> of reſtriction upon him ſtill. It is our comfort that though Satan (as Philoſophers ſpeake of liquids,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98733:135"/>
water, and the like) cannot keep himſelf in his own bounds, yet he is eaſily kept in bounds by the word and power of God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>So Satan went forth from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>] He is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon execution, as ſoon as he hath his commiſſion. We have explained theſe words in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>See then what he doth. <hi>He ſmote</hi> Job <hi>with ſore boiles from the ſole of his feet unto his crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſmote <hi>Job</hi> ſaith the Text. In the former afflictions Satan had inſtruments to work by: He ſtirred up the Caldeans and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans; he moved the fire and the winde into a conſpiracie againſt <hi>Job.</hi> Here he (that he might be ſure it ſhould be done fully) doth it himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſmote Job.</hi>] When the devil ſmiteth, he ſmiteth thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſmiteth home. When Angels ſtrike, they ſtrike to purpoſe. It is ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 12. that an <hi>Angel of the Lord ſmote</hi> Herod, <hi>and he was eaten of wormes, and gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> Spirits have mighty power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſmote Job</hi>; why, he did not demand to ſmite <hi>Job,</hi> he did but deſire to have him <hi>Toucht:</hi> you heard before ſomewhat of that. Satan moves that his fleſh and his bone might be only touched, now, his motion being granted, it is ſaid <hi>he ſmote him.</hi> There are two things in this ſmiting:</p>
               <p>Firſt, It notes ſuddenneſſe: He did not afflict him by a diſeaſe that grew upon him by degrees; as you know boiles and ſores or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily are long a gathering, breeding in, and breaking out of the fleſh; but he was all over full of theſe boiles in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſmiting intimates the vehemencie of it, a killing ſtroake, a deaths wound; the Hebrew word ſignifieth to ſtrike to death. So here was a ſudden ſtroake, and a vehement ſtroake.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>De homine oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit, perdidit.</hi>
                  </note> It muſt needs at once wound both his mind and body, on a ſudden, in a moment, to be filled with ſores, and covered with a ſcab; he ſaw no cauſe, he had no prognoſticks which might induce a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that his body was in ſuch a diſtemper; and ſo it looked the more like an immediate ſtroake from an offended God. Every
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98733:136"/>
word hath its weight and emphaſis to adde weight and anguiſh to this affliction.</p>
               <p>It may here be queſtioned, how Satan can be ſaid to ſmite? And the ſame doubt ariſeth about this action of good Angels; one of which, as executioner of Gods wrath ſmote of the Aſſyrians in one night an hundred and fourſcore and five thouſand, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 37.36. and another ſmote <hi>Herod, Act.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, how angels ſmite is a ſecret that we cannot expreſſe, nor fully apprehend. For this and the like expreſſions of ſmiting, are ſured to the nature of the patient, not of the Agent; man being a materiall ſubſtance is ſuſceptive, or capable of ſmiting, or of a ſtroake: But an angel being an immateriall ſubſtance, cannot ſmite properly, and he is therefore only ſaid to ſmite a man, becauſe we cannot ſignifie an effect or impreſſion upon a body, but by ſuch a word. We know that in the plague or other diſeaſes, when they are immediately inflicted by Angels, man receives a ſtroake, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſaid, to be ſmitten. But how the Angel gives that ſtroake or ſmites, is not knowne. Man may feel himſelf ſmitten by an Angel, but how the Angel ſmites he cannot underſtand. This word is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the recipient not to the efficient cauſe of the diſeaſe, or plague, or death.</p>

The Grammarians expreſſe it, ſometime more generally, A filthy ſcab; ſometime more particularly, An ulcer, a boile, ſometime a leprocie, it is indeed any foule diſeaſe breaking out upon the body.</p>
               <p>The ſame word is uſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.10. where it is ſaid, that God ſmote the Egyptians and the Magicians with boiles.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98733:136"/>
                  <hi>Jobs</hi> boyles were not the moſt painefull and malignant, a word is joyned to expreſſe it to the height: In the kind they were boyles, and (<hi>intenſivè</hi> or) in the degree, they were the worſt and moſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting boyles.</p>
               <p>Further in the fourth place, we know it is painfull for a man to have one boyle, eſpecially an angry burning one, a boyle of the worſt ſort; but it is ſubjoyned, <hi>he was ſmitten with boyles, from the ſole of his feete unto his crowne.</hi> To be all over boyles, and to be all over-run with the moſt painfull kind of boyles, what a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paine muſt this be? <hi>From the ſole of his feete unto his crown,</hi> there is the extent of this ſtroake. <hi>Intenſivè,</hi> it was the worſt kind of boyle, And <hi>Extenſivè,</hi> it was all over his body, no part free.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the ſole of his feete unto his crowne.</hi> It is uſuall in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thus to ſignifie the whole body? As <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.35. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſmite thee in the knees and in the leggs, with a ſore botch that cannot be healed, from the ſole of the foote to the top of the head, or to the crowne.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.6. when the Prophet would expreſſe what a generall blow the body politique had received from the hand of God by his judgements, (ſo it is there to be underſtood) he ſaith there were <hi>wounds and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores, from the ſole of the foote even unto the head.</hi> That is, the whole body politick, the whole State had at one time or other, or all at one time received wounds, and blowes, and ſtroakes from the hand of God. The extreames comprehend all the parts. That which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends from one extreame, or utmoſt part to another, is extended through all; from Eaſt to Weſt, is all the world over, and from head to foote, is all the body over. So then <hi>Satan ſmote him from the ſole of his foote to his crowne,</hi> is, He ſmote his whole body.</p>
               <p>All paines and diſtempers were gathered into this one malady, and all the parts of his body were ſmitten, as if they had bin but one member: only his tongue was untoucht, as is commonly obſerved, That it might be free to blaſpheme God, who had thus polluted the beauty and comelineſſe of his body, who had thus imbittered the comforts of his ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> being thus ſmitten, would ſurely looke out for helpe. Though it be exceeding ſinfull (with <hi>Aſa</hi> diſeaſed in his feete) to ſeeke to <hi>the Phyſitians and not to the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 16.12.</note> yet it is our duty to ſeeke to the Lord and the Phyſitian; To truſt in meanes is to neglect God, to neglect meanes is to tempt God.

And therefore to ſhew that either all had in vaine attempted to cure him, or that none durſt undertake the cure; the Text ſaith, <hi>That he tooke a potſheard to ſcrape him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe withall, and he ſate downe among the aſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words are a further aggravation of <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction. When he is in this manner ſmitten, ſmitten with boyles, ſmitten with the worſt of boyles, <hi>ſmitten with boyles</hi> all over, <hi>from the ſole of his feete unto his crowne:</hi> ſurely a man in this pickle had need to have ſome good tendance and looking to; ſuppoſe the Phyſitians and Chyrurgians could not cure him, yet they might eaſe him; if they had plyed him with Fomentations and ſuppling oyles, if they had bound up his ſoares with fine linnen to mittigate and molifie them. If ſuch applications and attendance had not bin a refreſhing to him, yet they would have bin a reſpect to him; if they had not bin an allay to his paine, yet they would have bin an honour to his perſon. But (as this 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verſe</hi> ſhewes us) when the man was thus nothing but ſores, he had then nothing to helpe him: He might ſay (as <hi>David</hi> afterwards in a ſad condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4.) <hi>I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me, refuge failed, or periſhed from me, no man cared for my ſoule.</hi> When thus, Lover and Friend, Phyſitian and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, Wife and Servant were farre from him, at leaſt in duty and affection; then he is forced to be both Patient and Phyſitian, ſick and Nurſe, <hi>he tooke him a pot-ſheard to ſcrape himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> Poore man! He who was lately in health, and the Greateſt man in the Eaſt, being now ſick, hath nothing left him but a peece of a broken pitcher.</p>
               <p>There are foure aggravations of his affliction in this.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, that he could get none to dreſſe him, he was
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98733:137"/>
faine to doe it himſelfe, ſaith the Text. Neither Wife, nor Servants, nor Friends would meddle with him. A hard caſe!</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, conſider what a toole he had to doe it with. He was left to be his owne Chirurgion, and his dreſſing inſtrument was <hi>a pot-ſheard.</hi> The word ſignifies, ſometimes a whole earthen pot, ſometimes a broken peece of it, a ſheard as we call it. Here is no mention of fine linnen and ſalves to heale, or of oyle to ſupple theſe ſoares, only a hard pot-ſheard is the tool, and ſcraping is all the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie. A hard caſe!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This intimates either, that his body was ſo loathſome by reaſon of the diſeaſe, that he was loath to touch himſelfe with his hands: As we ſay proverbially in our Language concerning a deformed or filthy creature; <hi>A man would ſcarce touch ſuch an one with a paire of Tongs.</hi> So, as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſo abhorred himſelfe, that he was loath to touch himſelfe with his bare hands, he muſt take ſomewhat, and for want of a better, a <hi>pot-ſheard</hi> to ſcrape himſelfe; He had not the heart (as it were) to touch himſelfe, his diſeaſe was ſo foule, that (as we ſay) it turn'd his ſtomack. This ſome give as a reaſon why he tooke a pot-ſheard, his body was ſo filthy that he was loath to touch it with his hands.</p>
               <p>Or as others give the reaſon, his boiles and ſoares did ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread and envenome his hands to the very nailes, that it was a paine for him to touch himſelfe; his fingers were ſo ſore, that he had ſcarce any uſe of them; this conſtrained him to make a poore ſhift, even to take <hi>a pot-ſheard to ſcrape himſelfe withall.</hi> What a lamentable caſe was this!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There followes yet a further aggravation of his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If a man be ſicke and full of ſores, yet if he can get an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie bed or ſome ſoft place to lie upon, it is a great comfort. You know how men will remove from bed to bed, from place to place when they are diſtempered and in paine. But ſee where <hi>Job</hi> lyes, he hath no Downe-bed nor ſoft pillowes, neither couch nor chaire to ſit in, but</p>
               <q>He ſate downe among the aſhes.</q>
               <p>There are two expoſitions concerning this; For his ſitting in the <hi>Aſhes,</hi> may be taken as a voluntary act, or as a neceſſary act.

So that this act of <hi>Job</hi> might be voluntary, and a geſture of repentance; ſitting downe among the aſhes, to humble and abaſe himſelfe before God.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts are ſuperſtitiouſly ceremonious in this point at this day: Annually obſerving a day which they affect to call <hi>Aſh-wedneſday,</hi> on which they ſprinckle themſelves with aſhes, as a preparatory to their formall Lenton Repentance. <hi>But we have not ſo learned Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, We may take it for a neceſſitated act, that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to this, to goe and ſit among the aſhes, (or as moſt from the Septuagint tranſlate it, to ſit downe upon a dung-hill) and that in two reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In regard of his poverty and want, as if he were ſo bereft and deſtitute of all outward things, that he had not a houſe to put his head in, not any other conveniencies to make uſe of; but was conſtrained to goe out, and ſit upon the dung-hill or amongſt the aſhes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Others rather conceive, that the neceſſity did ariſe from the contagion and loathſomeneſſe of his diſeaſe, ſo that he was forced to goe out of doores, he filled the houſe with ſuch a noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſmell.</p>
               <p>Or he was forced to goe out as a Leper; concerning whom the

               <p>But that <hi>Job</hi> ſate either without the City, or upon a dung-hill, is only a conjecture, and beſides the Text. Which way ſoever we take it, it is a great aggravation of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſorrowes. Take it for a neceſſitated ſitting in the aſhes abroad, it inferres, that either he was ſo poore, as that he had not a houſe to be in; or that his diſeaſe was ſo contagious, that he could not be endured in the houſe. Or take it for a voluntary act, that he did chooſe to ſit in aſhes, it was an aggravation of his affliction; for then it notes that he was in the loweſt, in the ſaddeſt condition that can be imagined: ſitting in aſhes, being an embleme of extreame ſorrow, and never uſed but in times of greateſt calamity, publick or perſonall.</p>
               <p>So that here, every circumſtance is an aggravation of <hi>Jobs</hi> affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He was ſmitten by Satan, and he ſmote hard enough: he ſmote him, and <hi>he ſmote him with boyles,</hi> he ſmote him with the moſt malignant kind of boyles; he ſmote him with ſuch boyles all over, <hi>from the ſole of his feet to his crowne</hi>; and when he was in this condition, he had no Nurſe, no Chirurgion, no Phyſitian to helpe him, he was forced to take a pot-ſheard to ſcrape himſelfe: he had no ſoft bed prepared to lye on, nor (as many have thought) houſe to be in; but out of the City, or out of his houſe he muſt, and among the aſhes, upon the dung-hill. Lo there he ſits.<note place="margin">

                  </note> What one ſaid of an exact Hiſtory of a great Prince; That ſurely it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten rather in theory as a pattern or picture of a Prince, then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth of a hiſtory. So we may ſay of this deſcription of <hi>Jobs</hi> troubles; That ſurely it was written rather as a ſtudied pattern of mans ſufferings, then as an accompliſht Hiſtory of the ſufferings of any man: yea who almoſt can goe ſo farre in imagination, as <hi>Job</hi> went in reall paſſion. But we will paſſe from the deſcription of his ſorrow to ſome Obſervations upon them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Here we ſee, That Satan if he be permitted, hath a power ſuddenly to aflict the body with diſeaſes; And that is a power farre tranſcending all the power that is in man; Man is able to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98733:139"/>
wound the body of his brother with a materiall inſtrument, but all the Tyrants in the world cannot ſmite the body with a diſeaſe, or command a man into ſickneſſe; Though God ſhould ſay to them as here to Satan, I give you leave, yet they muſt leave that to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: whoſe helpe is ſometime begg'd by envious wretches, who would kill their bretheren without a Sword, and vex them unſeene. Man muſt have a weapon to ſmite, but Satan can ſmite and kill without a weapon, if God ſay the word. Man can ſpill the blood, but Satan can poiſon the blood: He can infect the humours, and taint the ſpirits more ſubtilly, more ſpeedily then the moſt skilfull poiſoner in <hi>Rome.</hi> We ſhewed before how ſuddenly Satan can raiſe commotions in the ayre, ſtormes and tempeſts there; he can doe the like in our bodies: for ſuch are diſeaſes in the body as ſtormes and tempeſts in the ayre. Stormes make (as it were) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion among the Elements, and are the diſtemper of nature: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes make a confuſion among the humours, and diſtemper the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and ſpirits of the body. It is ſaid of the woman in <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.16. that Satan had bound her 28 yeares; Obſerve in that, the power Satan hath over the body, if God give him liberty to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it; As cruell men can bind in chaines, and caſt the body into priſon for many yeares, ſo Satan can bind the body with a ſpirit of infirmity as with a chaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly obſerve this, <hi>That health and strength of body are a very great bleſſing:</hi> You ſee Satan deſires to try <hi>Job</hi> by taking away this bleſſing laſt, and he thought this would make <hi>Job</hi> curſe God: you may ſee the value of it by his deſire to deſtroy it. <hi>Health is the Prince of earthly bleſſings.</hi> We ſay, he lives miſerably that lives by medicines, who to uphold nature is in the continuall uſe of art. How miſerably then doth he live, whom art and medicines cannot reſtore to health, who is diſeaſed beyond the help of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</p>
               <p>I might mind you likewiſe from this, to remember what fraile bodies we live in, even ſuch, as have in them the ſeeds of all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Sin indeed is the ſeed of ſickneſſe and of death. And hence it is, that if the humours of the body be a little ſtirr'd, they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne to a diſeaſe: and this houſe of clay is ready to diſſolve and fall. What is the ſtrength of the body, that we ſhould truſt it? or the beauty of the body that we ſhould be proud of it? We ſee in <hi>Job,</hi> how quickly the ſtrength of it is turned into weakeneſſe, and the beauty of it into blackneſſe. <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, and all the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98733:139"/>
goodlineſſe thereof is as the flower of the field; The graſſe withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and the flower fadeth,</hi> Iſa. 40.6.</p>
               <p>And here likewiſe note this, you that enjoy health of body, whoſe ſtrength yet continues, and your ſelves are free from the bonds of any bodily infirmity: while you heare of one ſmitten with a diſeaſe from the crowne of the head to the ſole of the feet, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a mercy you have, who have no paine from the crowne of the head to the ſole of the feete; who have not an aking joynt, nor paine ſo much as in a finger. It is like that many of you can ſay you have this bleſſing, you doe not know what paine in any one member meanes; looke upon a man, that knew nothing but paine, upon a man, that had not one member free; and prize your bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Such likewiſe who have paine and infirmities, in one or two, or more parts of the body, may ſee in this ſpectacle cauſe to bleſſe God, that they have any part free. To have but one or but a few ſores is mercy, ſparing mercy, when we behold another nothing but a ſore. Indeed when one member ſuffers, (whether in the body naturall or myſticall) all the members ſuffer with it. But compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not ſo heavy a burden, as paſſion is. And as the ſound mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſympathize in ſorrow with thoſe that are ſmitten, ſo they that are ſmitten, ſympathize in joy with thoſe that are ſound. The eaſe of one part mitigates the diſeaſe of another, and it is an abatement of our troubles to ſee thoſe whom we love in peace. Two are better then one (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi>) for if one fall the other may helpe him up, but if both fall, who ſhall helpe. And if every member ſuffer, there is paſſion in all, but compaſſion in none; much leſſe ſupport or helpe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly obſerve: <hi>Job</hi> in this condition was left of all. Doe not thinke it ſtrange if you be brought into ſuch ſtraights, as to be left alone, when you have moſt need of aſſiſtance. <hi>Job</hi> was as a man friendleſſe, Phyſitianleſſe, wifeleſſe, ſervantleſſe, all forſooke him. It is the comfort of the people of God, that they know how to be alone, and yet can never be alone: though they be left of all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible friends, yet they have an inviſible friend who will viſit them, ſtay with them by day, and watch with them by night, for he hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> In the Greeke there are five negatives to affirme this, that God will not leave his, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>And he that hath him alone, hath infinitely more then all the world in one.</hi> When friends and Phyſitians will not come neere, when wife and children take their leave or ſtand afarre off, when
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:98733:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſervants hold their noſes, being not able to beare the ſtinch and ill ſavour that cometh from the body, yea, when a man comes to be an abhorring to himſelfe, yet at that time God delights in him; Chriſt at that time imbraceth him, and takes him in his armes, and kiſſeth him with the kiſſes of his lips, which are better then wine, yea better then life. <hi>Job</hi> was never ſo neer God, ſo in the boſome of God, as when no creature in the world would ſo much as touch him; <hi>Job</hi> was never ſo beautifull in the eye of God, as when he had nothing but boiles upon him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I may preſent you with <hi>Job</hi> as he was upon his Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill in want of all things; from thence be admoniſhed, That the children of God, his deareſt ſervants may come to uttermoſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward extremities. When a man is among the aſhes, then he is at the loweſt: what can a man be leſſe then that? The Apoſtles were made as the filth of the world, as the off-ſcouring of all things, as ſweepings and off all which are caſt out upon the dunghill; So was <hi>Job</hi> in the ſenſe of many interpreters. They who are of moſt worth may be uſed as if they were worth nothing. <hi>Job</hi> was a pearle though upon a dunghill. <hi>They who were brought up in ſcarlet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace dunghils,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jeremie</hi> in his <hi>Lamentation</hi> for Jeruſalem, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.5. We may ſay, They who are brought up and clothed in better then ſcarlet, even in the robes of righteouſneſſe, and in the Garments of Salvation, may yet be brought to embrace a dunghill. There is no judging by Appearance; <hi>No man knowes love or hatred by all that is before him (or upon him)</hi> Eccleſ. 9.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, looke upon <hi>Job</hi> ſitting in the aſhes, as a voluntary act, and then obſerve, (which is of much concernement and uſe for us now in regard of the preſent condition we are in.) <hi>That as the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting hand of God doth increaſe upon a people, or upon a perſon, ſo ought the humiliation and repentance of that perſon or people to increaſe.</hi> When the hand of God was upon <hi>Job</hi> before, <hi>he rent his Mantle, he ſhaved his head,</hi> theſe were acts of great humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but now <hi>Job</hi> having a neerer and a deeper affliction upon him, humbleth himſelfe yet more. Then he fell upon the ground, but now he ſitteth among the aſhes. Greater afflictions call to greater hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. We ought not only to be humbled when God afflicteth, but to be humbled in a proportion to the affliction; As it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſin committed, Great ſins call for great ſorrow; And as it is in regard of mercies received, Great mercies call for great praiſes: ſo, Great troubles call us to great humiliations; and ſtill
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98733:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the greater troubles are, the greater our humiliation ought to be. This is one way of accepting the puniſhment of our iniquities, and of improving preſent evils for our everlaſting good. Conſider whether this be not the work of this day.</p>
               <p>We have had the hand of God upon the Nation in leſſer judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments heretofore, we have had warning-peeces ſhot of amongſt us; but now we heare the report of murthering-peeces every day. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers yeeres God made warre upon us with the ſword of the Angel, by which thouſands have fallen in our ſtreets: but now God hath put a ſword into the hands of men. The former ſword was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour compared with this, Thoſe wounds, a kiſſe compared with this. Both <hi>David</hi> and experience reſolve it thus.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.</note> Many of our dear brethren are ſlain and fallen by the ſword, their bloud hath been ſpilt like water, and their bones have been ſcattered as when one cleaveth or cutteth wood upon the earth. The ſpoyled cry to us for bread, the ſicke and wounded for helpe and healing. Many towns have been plundered, many Matrons and Virgins have been raviſhed, many families have been ſcattered, many wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren deprived of their husbands and parents, many pariſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of faithfull Paſtours, ſome of our dwellings turned to aſhes; And is it not time for us; not only to rent our garments, but to ſit in aſhes? do not theſe things call us to eat aſhes like bread, and mingle our drink with weeping. Is it not time for us not only to write, but to act a Lamentation, and to ſay, <hi>For theſe things I weepe, mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water?</hi> There is one thing yet, which may and ought to be a Lamentation to us, beyond all our own ſufferings, namely this, God is diſhonoured, his name is blaſphemed, his people are reproched. The enemies ſtrike this ſword in their bones, A ſcornfull enquirie, <hi>Where is now your God? Pſal.</hi> 42.10. Should not teares be our meat day and night (as they were <hi>Davids</hi>) while they ſay continually, Where is now your God? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.3. our not ſitting in the aſhes for ſuch things as theſe will bring us unto aſhes; and if we will not ſit upon the dunghill of our ſins in humiliation, our ſins will bring us, and our land unto a dunghill of deſolation. In this day, as of old by his faithfull Prophet (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.12.) doth <hi>the Lord God of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldneſſe, and to girding with ſackcloth</hi>; And not only to theſe, but to <hi>Jobs</hi> poſture of ſorrow, <hi>ſitting in aſhes</hi>; the voyce of the rod calleth to this: the voyce of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, heard daily in our ſtreets, cals to this. We have cauſe to cry
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:98733:141"/>
out as the Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> in his fourth chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at the very heart, my heart ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a noiſe in me, I cannot hold my peace, becauſe thou hast heard, O my ſoul, the ſound of the trumpet, and the alarm of war.</hi> And becauſe the ſound of the trumpet among us, like that on mount Sinai, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.19. doth not only ſound long, but alſo lowder and lowder; It becomes us, not only to continue our mourning, and our crying unto God, but to cry lowder and lowder. If we increaſe not our humiliations, God will yet increaſe our judgements: if we will not ſit in aſhes, he will bring us to aſhes, and puniſh us yet ſeven times more for our ſins.</p>
               <p>Wherefore receive the counſell of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> in theſe your afflictions, <hi>Be afflicted, and mourn and weep: let your laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be turned to mourning,</hi>

                  <item>2. How it came to paſſe that ſhe was ſpared, when all his outward comforts were removed?</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt, in a word. It is the opinion of many among the ancient Jewes, that <hi>Job</hi> lived in the time of <hi>Jacob</hi> the Patriark. And that he took to wife <hi>Dinah Jacobs</hi> daughter, but I leave the Rabbins to prove that, if they can. Why ſhe was ſpared in the time of ſo generall a calamity, may beare ſome further inquirie. For ſeeing a wife is the chiefeſt of creature comforts, and the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why God at the firſt did inſtitute that relation, was that man might have <hi>a help meet for him:</hi> it may ſeeme ſomewhat ſtrange why Satan, going about to bring upon <hi>Job</hi> trouble in its perfection,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.20.</note> ſhould leave him that, which is the perfection of all outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, <hi>a wife.</hi> What were <hi>Jobs</hi> Oxen, and Aſſes, and Sheep, and Camels to a wife? And what were his children to a wife? When <hi>Adam</hi> had not only ſuch a number of cattell, but all the cattell and riches in the world in his poſſeſſion, and under his dominion, God ſaw him defective till he provided him a wife, a wife was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of all. How then cometh it to paſſe, that when Satan would afflict <hi>Iob</hi> to the uttermoſt, he leaves him his wife?</p>
               <p>To cleare this, before we come to examine the words that ſhe ſpake. The Jewes which are the Authors of that afore-named opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that his wife was <hi>Dinah,</hi> tell us (to lengthen out the dreame) that ſhe was ſpared for <hi>Iacob,</hi> her fathers ſake. It is a truth, That children doe often fare the better for holy Fore-fathers. It is no mean privilege to be born of thoſe that are in Covenant. As God <hi>viſits the iniquitie of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate him, ſo he ſhewes mercy to thouſands of thoſe that love him, &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 20.5, 6. but in this place we have no ſtock to graft this truth upon, but a meere ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. I paſſe on.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſome conceive that his wife was out of Satans Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that he had nothing to do to meddle with her, ſhe being

comprehended under that clauſe of exception in the firſt Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>All that he hath is in thy power, only upon himſelfe put not forth thine hand</hi>; his wife (they ſay) was a part of himſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.24. <hi>And they (viz.</hi> the husband and the wife) <hi>ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> So that Satan could not ſmite her, but he muſt ſmite <hi>Iob</hi> too; therefore ſhe was exempted, ſay they, and ſet beyond the reach of Satans ſtroake.</p>
               <p>Though this may have ſome ſhew of wit in it, and ſomewhat of reaſon too, referring unto the firſt part of <hi>Iobs</hi> affliction; yet there is no ſhew of either in reference unto the ſecond, where Satan had a Commiſſion to afflict his bodie, his fleſh and his bone; for then ſhe alſo (take it in the ſenſe before) was comprehended under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Satan, being (though not as <hi>Eve</hi> from <hi>Adam,</hi> bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, yet) according to the law of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age given to all, <hi>One fleſh</hi> with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.24.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the third place, that which I conceive and agree with others in for the true reaſon why ſhe was ſpared, is this. That ſhe might be a further inſtrument of her husbands affliction. Satan meant to make uſe of her for his owne purpoſe, to drive on the main deſigne; and whereas ſhe ſhould have been a help to her husband, Satan employes her againſt her husband; this was his aime, and therefore ſhe was ſpared.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi>
                  </note> Hence one of the Ancients cals her <hi>the ſtrongeſt</hi> and fitteſt <hi>weapon,</hi> with which Satan did aſſault, the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Arrow in his Quiver, by which he wounded the ſoul and ſpirit of <hi>Iob.</hi> She that ſhould have had her hands buſied in the waſhing, ſuppling, curing, and healing of his wounds, ſmites him with her tongue, a piercing and a poyſon'd inſtrument. <hi>The rib was not ſmitten, that it might ſmite the head.</hi> Another compares her to a Ladder,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg. Moral.</hi>
                  </note> by which Satan hoped to ſcale this impregnable tower, that death might creep in at the window of his eares, by hearing and conſenting to her ſinfull perſwaſions.</p>
               <p>Seeing then Satan ſpared <hi>Jobs</hi> wife, that ſhe might be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this additionall affliction; which moſt conclude to be as the ſting of all his afflictions.</p>
               <p>Firſt note this, <hi>That Satans mercies have alwayes ſomewhat of crueltie in them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Planè nullae.</hi> Jun. in loc.</note> He ſpareth the wife, but it was that ſhe might further vex the husband. His mercies are like the mercies of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, <hi>Their tender mercies are cruell,</hi> that is, they are no mercies at all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.10. There is a puniſhing mercy, and there is a ſparing cruelty among men. Such are Satans ſparings ever
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98733:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lined with cruell and bloudy intendments.</p>
               <p>Secondly obſerve, <hi>That the greateſt outward bleſſings may prove the greateſt outward afflictions.</hi> A wife is made a croſſe, a ſnare. Our greateſt danger may be from our helper; And that which was given for our good, may be to us an occaſion of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>Satan can make uſe of our friends to doe us hurt by. He temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not only by himſelf, but by creatures: And not only by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are at a diſtance from us, but by thoſe who are neereſt in relation, and by thoſe, moſt. He can make a ſervant, a child, a wife inſtrumentall for our ruine. In this ſenſe, we may apply that caveat of the Prophet (<hi>Jer.</hi> 9.4.) <hi>Take ye heed every one of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and trust ye not in any brother.</hi> That alſo of <hi>Micah, Truſt ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doores of thy mouth from her that lyeth in thy boſome.</hi> Yea,<note place="margin">

                  </note> take heed of thy owne boſome, Satan drawes a party from our ſelves, againſt our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly obſerve, <hi>Satan is very ſubtile to make choiſe of ſuch inſtruments as may do his work moſt effectually.</hi> Of all thoſe that were about <hi>Job</hi> he could not have picked out any to have carried on his plot ſo powerfully and with ſuch probability of ſucceſſe. Firſt, in regard of her neerneſſe, ſhe had opportunitie to come unto him, and freedome to improve that importunity. <hi>Saul</hi> knew what hee did when he married his daughter to <hi>David. I will give him her</hi> (ſaid <hi>Saul) that ſhe may be a ſnare to him,</hi> 1 Sam. 18.21. Politick mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are uſually made for temptation, not for comfort: <hi>ſnares are tyed fasteſt, with a falſe lovers knot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the motion or perſwaſions of a wife, whether to good or evil are very taking upon a husbands heart: We ſee it in the firſt wife that ever was, ſhe by perſwaſions overcame <hi>Adam</hi> unto ſin, ſhe was the devils agent for the undoing of her husband, and the world. <hi>Ahab</hi> was very wicked, but he had a tempter in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. <hi>But there was none like unto</hi> Ahab, <hi>who did ſell himſelfe to work wickedneſſe, whom</hi> Jezebel <hi>his wife ſtirred up.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kin. 21.25.</note> Unparalell'd wickedneſſe is aſcribed to the provocations of a wife. When a Prince hath given up his affections, and his conſcience, into the hands of a malicious, wanton woman, he will quickly ſell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſuch wickedneſſe as will be his owne trouble, and entitle him (like king <hi>Ahab) the troublers of a kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Satan knew that a wound is deeper by how much the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98733:143"/>
hand is neerer that ſtrikes it. Afflictions preſſe us moſt when they are from our friends. What thou my ſon? ſaid <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the Senate. What thou my wife? Is thy hand upon me in my own houſe, might <hi>Job</hi> ſay? The Prophet brings in one queſtioning, <hi>What are theſe wounds?</hi> And Chriſt anſwering, <hi>Thoſe with which I was wounded in the houſe of my friends,</hi> Zech. 13.6. The height of enmity is thus expreſt, <hi>A mans enemies</hi> ſhall be <hi>the men of his own houſe,</hi> Micah 7.6. This cauſed <hi>David</hi> to complaine ſo bitterly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.12. <hi>It was not an enemie that had done this, but it was thou my friend, and my equall, and my companion:</hi> The friend wounded more then the ſword. So might <hi>Job</hi> complaine, It was not an enemy, it was not a Sabean, or a cruell Caldean that ſpake this, but it was thou my equall, my friend, my companion, and which is more then all theſe, My wife, my ſecond ſelfe.</p>
               <p>I grant that in one ſenſe, the wounds of a friend are precious: <hi>Precious are the wounds of a friend, but the kiſſes of an enemy are deceitfull.</hi> Precious are the wounds of a friend, when a friend doth wound with holy reproofe; but when a friend wounds by ſinfull counſell, or ſolicitations unto ſinne, thoſe are pernicious wounds. If that which is light in us be turned into darkneſſe (as Chriſt ſpeakes) how great is that darkneſſe?<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> So if that which ſhould be our comfort be turned into our ſorrow, how great is our ſorrow? Therefore we ſee why Satan ſpared the wife, that ſhe might be an inſtrument, and a moſt effectuall inſtrument, either to prevaile upon him, or to vex him in caſe ſhe did not prevaile. Doubtleſſe <hi>Job</hi> did not feele ſo much ſmart, when Satan ſmote both fleſh and bone, as now, when his fleſh and bone ſmote him. Thus we ſee the cruelty of Satans mercy: He ſpared <hi>Jobs</hi> tongue, and he ſpared <hi>Jobs</hi> wife; he ſpared his tongue that <hi>Job</hi> might have a member free for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of ſin, in curſing God; and he ſpared <hi>Jobs</hi> wife, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe might have an inſtrument to bid him ſin, <hi>Curſe God and die.</hi> This was her counſell.</p>
               <q>And his wife ſaid unto him, Doest thou ſtill retain thine integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Curſe God and die.</q>
               <p>Her words conſiſt of two parts:
<list>
                     <item>1. A ſharpe and a ſcornfull exprobration.</item>
                     <item>2. A wicked and ſinfull direction.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Her ſcornfull exprobration in theſe words: <hi>Doeſt thou ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thine integritie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her ſinfull direction in thoſe words: <hi>Curſe God and die.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:98733:143"/>Doest thou ſtill retain thine integritie?</q>
               <p>Words quick and ſhort.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tantum narrat ſcriptura, quae mulieris virus &amp; viri anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotum conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi>
                  </note> It is probable we have here only the <hi>compendium,</hi> or briefe of that diſcourſe which paſſed between <hi>Job</hi> and his wife. We have only the poiſon and the Antidote, as a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Expoſitor hints it upon this place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Septuagint</hi> have taken the boldneſſe (if they be not falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) to ſet down his wives ſpeech at large, and joyn it in with the body of the Text, thus: <hi>A long time being ſpent his wife ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, How long wilt thou hold out, ſaying, Behold, I wait yet a little while expecting the hope of my Salvation? For conſider, thy remembrance is blotted out from the earth, even thy ſons and thy daughters, the pains and travell of my womb, whom I have brought forth in vaine. Thou thy ſelf ſitteſt here in the rottenneſſe of worms, abiding all night in the open ayre. I poore hand-maid wander from place to place, from houſe to houſe, looking when the ſun will ſet, that I may take a little repoſe from the paines and ſorrowes which now oppreſſe me; but utter thou ſome word againſt the Lord, and die.</hi> The Greek Authors comment upon theſe words, as upon the text it ſelfe. But I ſhall wave them wholly. Neither ſhall I ſtay here in the Explication of the words according to our reading out of the Hebrew, becauſe we have handled them at the third verſe of this Chapter. In the teſtimony which God giveth concerning <hi>Job</hi>; where he ſpeakes thus to Satan, <hi>Haſt thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>how that he is a perfect man, &amp;c. and that he ſtill holdeth faſt his integritie?</hi> God ſpake it to the praiſe of Job, <hi>ſtill he holdeth faſt his integritie</hi>; his wife ſpeaks it to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and upbraideth him with it, <hi>Doeſt thou ſtill retain thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie?</hi> The words ſpoken by both are the ſame, but the ſenſe and intent of the ſpeakers is quite different. God ſpeakes them in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Job:</hi> his wife ſpeakes them in contempt of <hi>Job,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe formes them into a queſtion, a cutting kinde of ſpeech, <hi>Doeſt thou ſtill retaine thine integritie?</hi> As if ſhe ſhould ſay, What? art thou ſo ſenſeleſſe and ſo ſtupid, ſo mad and ſottiſh, to go on in this courſe ſtill? what haſt thou got by it? where are thy earnings? what is the advantage of holineſſe? or what is the profit of integritie, that thou holdeſt and huggeſt it ſo faſt? <hi>Doeſt thou ſtill retaine thine integritie?</hi> This I conceive is the ſumme of the queſtion, it is an upbraiding, a reproaching queſtion; and from that we may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:98733:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>Firſt, <hi>That thoſe things which commend us moſt to God, uſually render us moſt contemptible before the world. Doeſt thou ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thine integritie?</hi> She ſlighteth him, and ſcorneth him for this, whereas God highly commends him, ſpeakes it to his praiſe, <hi>That which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination in the ſight of the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 16.15.</note> And that which the Lord eſteemes highly, man abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates.</p>
               <p>Secondly this, <hi>It is the endeavour of Satan and his inſtruments to perſwade, that the profeſſion of holineſſe is vain and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Satan hath taught wicked ones, and they (like forward Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſay it without book,) ſay it openly, <hi>It is a vain thing to ſerve the Lord</hi>; Satan would faine infuſe this curſed principle into the hearts of Gods own people, and make them beleeve, their faith is alſo vain. <hi>Doeſt thou ſtill retain thine integritie?</hi> Come take a little counſell at the laſt, work like a wiſe man, wilt thou hold a thing thou canſt get nothing by? Take it on my word, thou canſt not thrive this way, thou canſt make nothing of it, what doſt thou meane to go on madding in ſuch a courſe as this? Thou ſhalt never get bread by it to put in thy head: no nor water to waſh thy hands. All thou getteſt by it, will be a knock, a rod upon thy back, a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon thy name. And wilt thou ſtill be ſo ſtrait-lac'd, and hold faſt thy integritie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, obſerve further from Satans intendment in putting ſuch words as theſe into the mouth of <hi>Iobs</hi> wife. <hi>That his great deſigne is to take advantage from outward troubles and ill ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to diſcourage the hearts, and weaken the hands of Gods people in holy duties.</hi> That was his project, quite to diſcourage <hi>Iob,</hi> and from the ill ſucceſſe he had in the ſervice of God, to get him put off his Livery, and give over his ſervice: It is the courſe that the world, inſtructed by Satan (as here <hi>Iobs</hi> wife was) ſtill holdeth with the people of God. Their language is, Why are you ſo preciſe, why ſo not, &amp;c? Doe you not obſerve you get nothing by your prayers? nothing by your faſting? nothing by your holineſſe? All that you have got, you may put in your eyes, and ſee never the worſe. Shew us ſome of your gaines, what have you got? where are your delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances? where are your victories? where is your Salvation? you have prayed till you are almoſt undone, you have faſted till all is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt, things are worſe then they were, will you ſtill goe on in theſe duties of faſting and praying? of humbling and ſeeking? of waiting and beleeving? This is the language of Satan, this the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:98733:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Hell: And I ſhall anſwer it in one word. <hi>It is far better to die praying, then to conquer blaſpheming.</hi> Such doctrine may ſtop up a hypocrites mouth, and weaken his heart from duty. But it will more open the mouths, &amp; enlarge the hearts of thoſe who are ſincere. Will the hypocrite alwayes call upon God, will he delight himſelfe in the Almighty? ſaith <hi>Job.</hi> No, he delights in God no longer, then God gives him worldly delights, nor calls upon God any longer, then ſenſible bleſſings are ſent in unto him: If God ſtayes his hand, he ſtopps in duty; he quickly takes out Satans leſſon, and will no longer hold his integrity. But Grace ſhewes us wages in the worke: A godly man hath his fruit in holineſſe, and therefore though he receives no outward fruit, he ſtill holds faſt his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But what would <hi>Jobs</hi> wife adviſe him to doe; in caſe he ſhould let goe the holineſſe of his life: That followes in the next words; having endeavoured to take him off from one courſe, ſhe directs him to another.</p>
               <q>Curſe God and dye.</q>
               <p>Here is the ſecond part of her counſell, curſed counſell indeed. <hi>Curſe God and dye.</hi> It is the ſame Originall word which we have opened before, and met with two or three times already. In the proper ſignification it noteth <hi>bleſſing,</hi> and ſo the word is by many expoſitors rendred in this place, <hi>Bleſſe God and dye</hi>; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> tranſlates it ſo in one entire ſentence, <hi>Doeſt thou ſtill retaine thine integrity, bleſſing God and dying.</hi> We muſt therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine both ſides, that we may find out more fully the ſenſe of theſe words.</p>
               <p>Some take the words in a good ſenſe, and ſome take them in an ill ſenſe. Some take the words in a good ſenſe, <hi>Bleſſe God and dye,</hi> And others who tranſlate, <hi>Bleſſe God and dye,</hi> doe yet expound it to an ill ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some make a good conſtruction out of theſe words of <hi>Jobs</hi> wife, affirming that ſhe gave her husband wholeſome advice, and ſo they render the words, <hi>Bleſſe God and dye</hi> to this ſenſe. What? doeſt thou ſtill ſtand upon termes with God? wilt thou not humble thy ſelfe? ſhouldeſt thou not rather <hi>Bleſſe God?</hi> that is, pray unto God, humble thy ſelfe and ſeeke his face; ſo to bleſſe, ſignifies to pray, to make ſupplication. Thou ſeeſt in what a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition thou art, therefore <hi>bleſſe God,</hi> make thy humble prayer before God, <hi>and die,</hi> that is, deſire him to take thee out of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98733:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this miſerable world, to releaſe thee of thy paine; begge that he would cut the thred of thy life which (to appearance) is the only remedy of all thy troubles; death will be thy beſt friend: Thou mayeſt die with more eaſe, then live as thou doeſt. Thy life is a continuall death, it were better for thee to die once, then to die daily.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Beza</hi> is very ſtrong in this opinion, excuſing, yea acquitting <hi>Jobs</hi> wife, in making this motion to her husband. He grants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that ſhe being deceived and over-wrought by Satan, did work ſtrongly for him, yet denies that either the counſell in it ſelfe or in her intendment was evill. He layes the whole matter thus. That ſhe obſerving her husbands ſilence under the hand of God in theſe great afflictions, ſuſpected that he ſtood too much upon his own integrity, that he was too well opinionated and conceited of his own worth; or that this proceeded from fearedneſſe of conſcience, and inſenſibleneſſe of Gods dealing, and his own condition: and therefore ſhe adviſeth him to conſider, that ſurely God was very angry with him, to conſider, that God had brought all this evill upon him to humble him; and ſhould he now defend his owne innocencie? ſhould he either be ſilent and not acknowledge his ſin, or ſtand upon termes with God in defence and juſtification of himſelfe? Doeſt thou perſevere in thoſe high thoughts of thy ſelfe? will not all this bring thy ſtomack down? what? will not thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed heart be humbled? <hi>Doest thou ſtill retaine thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity?</hi> doeſt thou ſtill leane upon that broken reed, thy owne integrity? <hi>Bleſſe God,</hi> that is, confeſſe thy ſins and acknowledge thy tranſgreſſions. (Indeed confeſſing of ſin is a bleſſing of God: it is a giving of glory to God, and our giving glory to God is our bleſſing of God; <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Give glory to the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and make confeſſion unto him.</hi>) Thus bleſſe God, that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe thy ſin, and ſo prepare thy ſelfe to die in a holy manner, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou art paſt hope of life, addreſſe thy ſelfe piouſly for death. Thus he;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Teipſum ad mortem ſanctè obeundam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parato</hi> Beza.</note> and all upon theſe grounds; Firſt, becauſe he could not be perſwaded that a wife, the Governeſſe of ſuch a holy family as <hi>Jobs</hi> was, a wife, the companion of ſuch a holy man as <hi>Job</hi> was, ſhould be ſo full of the Devill, ſo wicked to ſpeake the Devils words, with the Devils heart. And ſecondly, becauſe Satan himſelf could not be ſo ſenceleſſe as to beleeve or hope, that ſuch deſperate counſell could ever take upon <hi>Jobs</hi> heart: And therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that ſhe adviſed him only, as any one would a dying friend,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98733:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or a malefactor condemned and ready to be carried to execution, yet perſiſting in his ſin, or unlamenting the wickedneſſe which procur'd that ſentence. Her errour ſaith he, was only this, that ſhe judged him wicked, becauſe he was thus ſmitten, and that he truſted upon his integrity, becauſe he held it faſt: whereas indeed <hi>Job</hi> looked for no good, but out of the hand of <hi>Free-grace,</hi> and accounted his very <hi>Integrity but dung, to the righteouſneſſe and redemption of the promiſed Meſſiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (with humble reſpect to ſo reverend an Authour) there are two reaſons ſtrong againſt this Expoſition, in my apprehenſion, which I ſhall propoſe and ſubmit to the readers judgement.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, It had been quite againſt Satans deſigne, that <hi>Jobs</hi> wife ſhould give her husband good counſell: For it had been ſo farre from being an addition to <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction, that it had been a great abatement of it to heare his wife ſpeake ſo holily, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring ſuch wholeſome counſell in the ſubſtance of it, though miſtaken in the application of it to him. And ſurely a heart ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as <hi>Jobs,</hi> was under all theſe preſſures, would have ſhaped out ſuch an anſwer as this. My deare wife, I thanke thee for thy care and counſell, thou haſt a holy jealouſie over me, that I am not in ſuch a poſture of ſpirit as becomes a dying man. Though there be an errour in thy adviſe as applied to me, yet I take it as an errour of love, and thy reproofe though miſplaced, is very acceptable and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious unto me.</p>
               <p>But (which makes my ſecond reaſon,) He reproves her for it, and tells her plainely, <hi>Thou ſpeakest as one of the fooliſh women ſpeaketh,</hi> Whereas if that had been the meaning of her words, <hi>ſhe ſpake as one of the wiſe women</hi>; like a wiſe woman indeed. It is an act of wiſedome and of love both to ſuſpect ill of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when that ſuſpition leads us only to adviſe him for his good. It is an excellent thing when jealouſies are improved into faithfull counſels. Surely then <hi>Job</hi> had never numbred her with the fooliſh women, if that ſpeech of hers had imported only an humble pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for his approaching death.</p>

               <p>So farre of thoſe who tranſlate the text, <hi>bleſſe God and die,</hi> with that two-fold expoſition upon it; I ſhall now conſider what ſenſe we are to make out of theſe words as we tranſlate them, and as they are indeed moſt generally tranſlated. <hi>Curſe God and die:</hi> This reading of the text, ſeemes moſt anſwerable to Satans deſigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being to provoke <hi>Job</hi> to curſe God, it was moſt proper to ſute his wives ſpirit with ſuch thoughts, and to put his own words into her mouth, <hi>Curſe God and die:</hi> This thred is of the ſame ſpinning with the former, and carries Satans plot home upon his own principles; She ſpeakes this adverſaries mind as fully as he could himſelfe, when ſhe bids her husband, <hi>Curſe God and die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But could <hi>Job</hi> die when he liſted, that ſhe biddeth him <hi>curſe God and die?</hi> What meanes this language?</p>
               <p>Some interpret her meaning to be this, <hi>die by thy owne hand,</hi> deſtroy thy ſelfe; as ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> uſe to ſay, goe hang thy ſelfe, murther thy ſelfe, make an end of thy ſelfe: As God by theſe plagues is thy Judge, ſo be thou (to end the matter) thy owne executioner.

               <p>Laſtly, <hi>curſe God,</hi> That ſo the Magiſtrate taking notice of it, thou mayeſt be cut off by the Sword of Juſtice. We know blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers were ſentenc'd to death without mercy, by the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and it is not improbable that the light of nature might carry thoſe Nations, to as high and ſevere a revenge, againſt that higheſt ſin. We know <hi>Socrates</hi> was adjudged to death by the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> (as their naturall divinity taught them) for an injurious or diſhonourable ſpeech concerning their gods. I conceive her counſell, <hi>curſe God and dye,</hi> had ſome of theſe intendements in it; The beſt of them is bad enough, and ſo bad, that it renders this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt them all.</p>
               <p>It is objected, That ſurely, any of theſe carry too high a ſtraine of wickedneſſe for <hi>Jobs</hi> wife; ſurely ſhe could not imagine, much leſſe have the boldneſſe to offer, ſuch advice to her husband.</p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt in generall, A good man may have a very bad wife. A husband cannot infuſe holineſſe, or make his wife good: Marriage doth not change the heart; Marriage with Chriſt doth,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98733:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but not marriage with a Chriſtian, or the holieſt man that ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Therefore that reaſon is not cogent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſpeech, and a holy perſon are not altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent: poſſibly <hi>Jobs</hi> wife was a good woman, though actually ſhe ſpake thus wickedly. Divers of the Jewiſh doctours have an opinion, that it was not <hi>Jobs</hi> wife that ſpake, but the devill in her likeneſſe. I ſhall leave that among their other dreames. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured by others, (though it were not the devil that ſpake, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating his wife, yet) that it was the devill ſpeaking in or by the perſon of his wife, as he ſpake in or by the ſerpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Or as perſons really poſſeſt of the devill, who ſpeake Satans words, and do Satans works, not their own. Some (I ſay) carry it thus, that ſhe was for that time not only acted, but actually poſſeſt by the devill, and ſo ſpake the devils language: One of the Ancients is expreſſe to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Chryſoſtome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>Theſe are the devils words, not the womans words:</hi> which another illuſtrates by that in the third of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>The ſerpent ſaid unto the woman,</hi> but it was the devill that ſpake unto the woman by the ſerpent; ſo here it is ſaid, <hi>His wife ſpake unto him,</hi> but the truth is, it was the devill ſpake unto him, in and by his wife. And if ſo, put the language into the worſt expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition given, or give a worſe (if truth will beare it) and it will be no wrong to ſuch an Orator. I beleeve we cannot expound the words to a higher ſenſe or ſtraine of wickedneſſe, then Satan could ſpeake.</p>
               <p>But we need not make Satan himſelfe the ſpeaker, and yet cleare the matter too; though we neither ſay as the Jewiſh doctours, that it was the devill perſonally, taking the ſhape of <hi>Jobs</hi> wife, or as thoſe Chriſtian Fathers, that the devill did actually poſſeſſe her; yet we may ſay (and ſo ſalve the difficulty) that ſhe was mightily over-powred, and acted by the temptation of Satan, to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of temptation, in this groſſe manner againſt her husband: Though ſhe were not acted as the Serpent was, in whom Satan ſpake to <hi>Eve</hi>; yet we may well ſay, ſhe was acted as <hi>Eve</hi> by whom Satan ſpake to <hi>Adam: Eve</hi> ſpake the devils minde, being prevailed upon by his temptation, to perſwade her husband to eat againſt the command of God; and <hi>Jobs</hi> wife overcome by a like temptation at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts the perſwaſion of her husband to curſe God.</p>
               <p>For as it is poſſible for one that is good, to fall into the groſſeſt and moſt blaſphemous temptation himſelf, ſo it is poſſible for one that is good to be made an inſtrument of ſuch temptations unto
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:98733:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
others. We may ſee an inſtance neere, if not fully reaching this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion in the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who hearing Chriſt fore-telling his ſufferings, takes him aſide and <hi>began to rebuke him ſaying, Be it farre from thee, Lord: this ſhall not be unto thee,</hi> Mat. 16.22, 23. <hi>Peter</hi> acted Satans part, in this, againſt his Maſter, though unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, yet ſo wittily, ſo to the life, that he got his name by it, <hi>Chriſt ſaid to</hi> Peter, <hi>get thee behind me Satan:</hi> It was <hi>Peters</hi> tongue, but Satan tun'd it. <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid of his ſonne <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Eſaus</hi> dreſſe; <hi>The hands are the hands of</hi> Eſau, <hi>but the voice is the voice of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. Chriſt perceived here Satans counſell in <hi>Peters</hi> words, he ſaw the wicked ſpirit through the cloathing of <hi>Peters</hi> fleſh; and therefore rebukes the Organ, under the title of the chiefe agent. <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi> Now as <hi>Peter,</hi> though a holy man and full of good intentions to his Maſter, yet ſpake the Devils mind and language ſo fully, that the Devill himſelfe (as to that purpoſe) could ſcarce have mended it. So likewiſe <hi>Jobs</hi> wife might be a godly woman in the maine, though abuſed and miſled by Satan, ſhe thus excited her husband, in the groſſeſt conſtruction thoſe words can beare, to <hi>curſe God and die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is ſomewhat in the Text, which may give us a hint of this: that though ſhe ſpake this, yet <hi>Job</hi> eſteemed her a good woman; For, obſerve <hi>Jobs</hi> anſwer to this advice. What doth he ſay? He doth not ſay, <hi>Thou wicked woman, thou abhominable wretch,</hi> why doeſt thou give me ſuch counſell? All that he ſaith is this, <hi>Thou ſpeakest as one of the fooliſh women ſpeaketh.</hi> Obſerve it, he doth not call her fooliſh or wicked woman, but, <hi>thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women</hi>; As if he ſhould ſay, How now wife? what words are theſe that I heare from thee? thou doſt not ſpeake now like thy ſelfe, I uſe to heare other language from thee, thou and I have had other kind of conference, and I have received other kind of counſell from thee then this; Whence is it that thou art ſo unlike thy ſelfe? where are thy words ſeaſon'd with ſalt,<note place="margin">

Thus much may ſerve to evince,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:98733:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that though we take the words in that worſt ſenſe, yet it doth not neceſſarily inferre, that <hi>Jobs</hi> wife was a wicked, an ungodly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which is the objection againſt that Expoſition.</p>
               <p>From the words tranſlated, <hi>Curſe God and die,</hi> and thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, we may obſerve;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That Satan is reſtleſſe and unwearied in this deſigne to bring the people of God, to thinke ill and ſpeake ill of God.</hi> It is that he laboured for, in the carrying on of this whole buſineſſe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Job</hi>; and every ſtone is turned, every way tryed to accompliſh this propoſed end.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In that he perſwadeth <hi>Job</hi> by his wife, when he was in this wofull condition, to <hi>curſe God and die,</hi> Obſerve, <hi>That Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan would perſwade us to eaſe our ſelves of troubleſome evills, by falling into ſinfull evils. Job</hi> was grievouſly diſeaſed, you ſee the medicine and the cure that Satan preſcribeth, Goe ſinne, ſaith he, <hi>curſe God and die</hi>; whereas one of the leaſt evills of ſin, is worſe then all the evills of ſuffering that can befall us. All ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes are more elegible then one ſin. It hath been rightly taught us from Antiquitie, that the loweſt degree of a lye (becauſe ſin) is not to be made or admitted (if that <hi>medium</hi> could be aſſured ſo noble an end) for the ſaving of a world. What a father, and teacher of lyes then is Satan, who directs many a poore ſoule to ſave it ſelfe from, or helpe it ſelfe out of a ſmall affliction, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing upon ſome great tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Curſe God and die, It is ſinfull to wiſh our own deaths, though we are under paines more painefull then death.</hi> It is ſinfull to deſire death abſolutely, we may deſire it with ſubmiſſion to the will of God; To live is an act of nature, but to be willing to live becauſe God wills it, is an act of grace: And as it is our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe to doe the will of God while we live, ſo it is our holineſſe to be content to live, while we ſuffer according to his will. On the other hand, to die is an act of nature, but to die becauſe God wills it, is an act of grace: Chriſt is ſaid to be obedient unto death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he died in contemplation of Gods decree, and in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to his good pleaſure. To die thus, is the duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and the crowne of all his obedience. Satan would have us live as we will, and die when we will; he tempts us as much to die when we liſt, as to live how we liſt. Satan puts <hi>Job</hi> upon it peremptorily, <hi>curſe God and die,</hi> deſire or procure thy own death. To wiſh d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th that we may enjoy Chriſt, it is a holy wiſh, but yet
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98733:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we muſt not wiſh that neither, abſolutely. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 1.23. <hi>deſired to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt,</hi> yet you ſee how he qualifies and debates it. To wiſh for death, that we may be freed from ſinne, is a holy wiſh, but yet wee muſt not wiſh that abſolutely neither, we muſt referre our ſelves to the pleaſure of God, how long he will let us conflict with our corruptions and with our luſts, with this body of death and ſin, which we beare about us. But to wiſh for death, becauſe our lives are full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is an unholy wiſh; God may, yea and hath as much uſe of our lives, in our troubles as in our comforts: <hi>We may doe much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for God in a ſick-bed:</hi> We may doe God as much worke when we are bound hand and foote, in a priſon, as when we are at liberty; paſſive obedience brings as much glory to God as active doth: therefore we muſt not wiſh for death, eſpecially not with an abſolute wiſh, becauſe we are under troubleſome evils. And if it be ſinfull to wiſh for death, how wicked is it to procure or haſten death, to pull down our houſe of clay, with our own hands, becauſe we are under troubleſome evills.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Obſerve further, <hi>Satan would perſwade that death is an end, at leaſt an eaſe, of outward troubles</hi>; Wouldeſt thou have an end of thy troubles and of thy ſorrowes? <hi>Curſe God and die,</hi> here is the remedy. We ſay indeed of ſome remedies, that they are worſe then the diſeaſe; but I am ſure, this is. Death to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ones, it is ſo farre from being an end or an eaſe of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that it is to them (as Chriſt ſpeakes in another caſe) the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of ſorrowes, the entrance to eternall death, and the very ſuburbs of Hell. Yet, how many doth Satan perſwade (when they are in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, in great extremities) that death will be the cure of all their troubles.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Obſerve, <hi>That Satan would make men willing to die, when they are moſt unfit to die.</hi> You ſee what preparation Satan directs <hi>Job</hi> unto, he biddeth him <hi>curſe God and die.</hi> Would not <hi>Job,</hi> thinke you, have bin in a fit poſture, in a fit frame for death, when he had bin curſing God? Repent and die, pray and die, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelfe and die, beleeve and die, <hi>take faſt hold of Chriſt who is our life, our way to life and die,</hi> are the counſels and voice of the holy Ghoſt, but Satans language is <hi>curſe God and die,</hi> ſin and die, be impenitent and die, blaſpheme and die. And it is an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced truth, that oftentimes they ſeeme moſt willing to die, who are moſt unfit, moſt unready for death; you ſhall ſee ſome men
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98733:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
venturing, yea caſting away their lives without feare or wit, the whole viſible buſineſſe of whoſe lives, hath been nothing elſe, but a working out of their own damnation, without feare or trembling. They as it were give diligence all their dayes, to make Hell and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation ſure, and yet goe out of the world as if they were ſure of Heaven. This is Satans preparation, <hi>curſe God and dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Note this, <hi>That the holieſt perſon is lyable to the moſt blaſphemous temptation.</hi> One would have wondred that Satan ſhould ever have ventured to ſuggeſt ſuch a groſſe thing as this, to ſo holy a man as <hi>Job.</hi> But Satan where he hath been often foyled, growes impudent; and will then ſuggeſt ſuch things, not becauſe he hopes to prevaile, but becauſe he reſolves to vex ſuch as he cannot overcome. He troubles as much and as many as he can.</p>
               <p>So much of the counſell which <hi>Jobs</hi> wife gave him, reproving him as fooliſh and over-credulous in holding faſt (that unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing) his integrity; and adviſing him to be worſe then mad or out-ragious, in curſing God and dying.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider <hi>Jobs</hi> holy and wiſe reply in the tenth Verſe.</p>
               <q>But he ſaid unto her, Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women ſpeaketh; what? ſhall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evill?</q>

Hence the Latin word <hi>(Nebulo)</hi> which ſignifies a Knave, is by good Etymologiſts derived from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>Nabal</hi>; becauſe ſuch are dull-heads in goodneſſe, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only in wickedneſſe. Such was he. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.25. Nabal <hi>is his name, and folly is with him</hi>; That proper name is the ſame with the Appellative here, that's the Maſculine, this the Feminine, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt like a Nabaleſſe:</hi> We find the word often uſed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to ſignifie wicked, worthleſſe and vile perſons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>The foole hath ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6, 21. at the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe, <hi>O foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh people and unwiſe, doe ye thus requite the Lord?</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>They have provoked me to anger by thoſe that are no gods, and I will provoke them to jealouſie by them which are not a people, and move them to anger with a fooliſh nation</hi>; by them which are not a people, by a fooliſh nation: A fooliſh people deſerve not the name of a people. Looke upon this word in the abſtract, folly is wickedneſſe; and to worke folly, is in the language of the Scripture, as much, as to worke wickedneſſe, to worke the greateſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Hence it is ſometimes tranſlated villany, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.22, 23. <hi>The Lord make thee like</hi> Zedekiah <hi>and like</hi> Ahab, <hi>whom the King of</hi> Babylon <hi>rosted in the fire, becauſe they have committed vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany in</hi> Iſrael. And throughout the Booke of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> the foole and an ungodly man, a wiſe-man and a godly man, are <hi>(Synono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes).</hi> words ſignifying the ſame thing. Thus <hi>Job</hi> reproves his wife, <hi>thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women,</hi> like one of thoſe who have no wiſedome, no goodneſſe, not any ſenſe or ſap of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them. But who were theſe fooliſh women, at whom he aimes in this compariſon? that is not cleare; ſome conceive he intends the women of <hi>Idumea,</hi> Thou ſpeakeſt as one of theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then women, theſe <hi>Idumeans,</hi> I have heard indeed ſuch language from them, when things have gone amiſſe with them, I have heard them curſing their Idols, curſing their gods, I have heard them raile at fate, fall out, and wrangle with fortune; <hi>Thou speakest like one of them.</hi> Thou takeſt thy patterne in this from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Heathen, who uſe their gods courſely, when they thinke they have but courſe uſage from their gods. If their gods
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:98733:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be angry, they will be angry with and revile their gods. <hi>Thou spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest after the rate of theſe fooliſh women</hi>; Thou diddeſt never heare ſuch doctrine in my family, or among thoſe who feare and love the true and ever-living God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> you ſee is now ſomewhat warme in his ſpeech. <hi>Job</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured much, and all his ſufferings hitherto had not ſtirr'd any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in him but that of ſorrow, as we ſaw in the latter end of the former Chapter; Not an angry poſture, not an angry expreſſion all along; but now, that God, and the wayes of God are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Job</hi> can hold no longer: this ſpeech of his wife, caſt diſhonour upon both, and now paſſion begins to ſtir, hee cannot forbeare her though his wife, <hi>Thou speakeſt as one of the fooliſh women speaketh.</hi> Obſerve, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paſſion becometh us in the cauſe of God</hi>; Our Lord Chriſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his Diſciples the true meaning of the Law, tells them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. <hi>He that is angry with his brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the judgement</hi>; but he that is not angry when there is cauſe, eſpecially when there is ſuch a cauſe as this, he likewiſe is in danger of the Judgement.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Iuſta ira ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinae.</note>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> is not only angry with her, but he reproves her, <hi>Thou speakeſt as one of the fooliſh women. It is lawfull ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to expreſſe holy anger and paſſion by ſharpe reproofes.</hi> Chriſt who was meekneſſe and humility it ſelfe, yet when he hath to deale with <hi>Phariſees,</hi> he can call them <hi>a generation of vipers, painted Sepulchers, blind guides, an adulterous generation, children of the Devill:</hi> Anger can hardly be ſilent, and that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is admirable which ſpeakes and ſinnes not. He that knowes not how to be angry, knowes not how to love. And he that knowes not how to reprove with love, knowes not how to be angry.</p>
               <p>You may diſcerne love in <hi>Job,</hi> mingling with and moderating his reproof. <hi>Job</hi> rebukes his wife, but it is with the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Firſt, He doth not ſpeake poſitively or down-right, <hi>Thou art a foole,</hi> but comparatively, <hi>Thou speakeſt as one of the fooliſh women uſe to speake</hi>: That ſeemes one mitigation or allay of this reproofe; yet I confeſſe ſuch ſpeaking by way of ſimilitude, hath often in it the force and intent of a direct aſſertion.</p>
               <p>Another thing obſerveable for the meekneſſe of <hi>Job,</hi> is this. He doth not fall out with the whole Sex, and ſay, ye women are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and ignorant, and impatient; But <hi>thou speakest as one of the fooliſh women.</hi> He doth not charge the whole Sex, he knew there
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:98733:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were wiſe women, as well as fooliſh, ſuch <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribes, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.26. <hi>She openeth her mouth with wiſedome</hi>; and we know <hi>Abigail</hi> the wife was wiſe, and her husband was <hi>Naball,</hi> a foole. <hi>Iob</hi> doth not lay it upon women in generall, he falleth not out with all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew there were ſome <hi>fooliſh ones,</hi> and becauſe he ſaw his wife in that act, imitating <hi>thoſe fooliſh ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a third thing mitigating the ſharpneſſe of the reproof; <hi>Iob</hi> doth not fall out with, or diſguſt the ordinance of God, becauſe his wife ſpake thus; he ſaith not, who would marry to be yoak't with ſuch a one as you? It is enough, to make one forſweare marriage, to have or heare of ſuch a wife; better be in any condition then in a married condition. How often doe husbands diſcover this folly? if their wives diſpleaſe them, preſently the ordinance of God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth them, who would be married? It is very ſad, when mans miſcarriage, makes us queſtion, or diſreliſh the inſtitution of God.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, <hi>Iob</hi> is not only, not angry with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God in generall, but he is not angry with the ſpeciall act of Gods providence, in his own particular choice. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will ſay, if their wives trouble them, I wiſh we had never ſeene the faces one of another, we may curſe the houre we ever met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Iobs</hi> ſpirit was farre from this; he was indeed angry with his wife, but he was not angry, becauſe this woman was his wife: He doth not reject her, becauſe ſhe was bad, but labours to make her better. <hi>To convince another of folly, is the readieſt way to make him wiſe.</hi> Thus we ſee, though there were ſharpeneſſe in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe to ſearch the wound, yet there was none to exaſperate the perſon: This reproofe was an exact compound of love, and anger, of zeale and knowledge.</p>
               <p>From the ground of her counſell, and this reproofe compared together, we may Obſerve; <hi>That it is an argument of a low and of a fooliſh ſpirit, to judge of any mans condition, by Gods outward dealings with him:</hi> For, this was it, that ſhe grounded her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell upon; ſeeing his outward condition, ſhe thought him as a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man, and therefore adviſeth him, to <hi>curſe God and die. Thou ſpeakeſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as one of the fooliſh women.</hi> It is an argument of folly and madneſſe, to judge a man miſerable becauſe poore, or unhappy, or unhealthy.</p>
               <p>Againe obſerve, <hi>That unworthy and low thoughts of God, argue a low and a fooliſh ſpirit. Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the Nabaleſſes?</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:98733:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thou haſt ſuch low thoughts of God, and ſpeakeſt ſo poorely of God, that at preſent I cannot but number thee among the fooles; for as there is nothing ought to be ſo high in our thoughts, as God and his wayes; ſo we ought to have high and reverent thoughts of God and his wayes, whatſoever he doth with us: though we change, yet he and they change not; God is the ſame, and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the ſame for ever.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Obſerve, <hi>That to doe or ſpeake wickedly, is to doe or ſpeake fooliſhly.</hi> Sin is the greateſt folly in the world, ſin is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from the rule of right reaſon, both from ſpirituall reaſon and from naturall, <hi>Loe they have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wiſedome is in them?</hi> Jer. 8.9. True wiſedome, is to walke by a right rule, to a right end. While we ſin, luſt (in ſome degree or other) is the rule, and ſelfe is the end. In both which we joyne hands with folly, and are the companions of fooles; <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From the reproofe it ſelfe, we come to conſider the reaſons of the reproofe. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women ſpeaketh, what? ſhall we receive good at the hand of God and not evill?</hi> Here is the reaſon upon which he grounds his reproofe, <hi>Shall we receive good at the hands of God,</hi> &amp;c.

reverently, reſpecting God and his wayes of providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.

               <p>
                  <hi>Shall we receive good?</hi> Some interpret the <hi>good</hi> here to be meant, of the good of the next life; ſhall we be in expectation of everlaſting good? ſhall we be in expectation of enjoying Chriſt, and ſeeing the face of God for ever in Heaven? ſhall we be at leaſt in hope, of a crowne of glory, layed up in ſtore for us? and ſhall we not be willing to receive evills, and digeſt troubles, to beare the croſſe a few dayes while we are here? <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.18.) <hi>reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared to the glory which ſhall be revealed.</hi> Shall we have glory in the eye of our faith, and ſhall we not endure a little trouble in the eye of our ſence?</p>

Good of every kind, and all kinds of poenall evill come forth from God. Indeed, God uſually conveyes theſe to us by the hand of man; but it becomes us to receive them as from the hand of God. Much, both good and evill, comes to us at the ſecond hand, but we ought to take it as from the firſt. This truth well wrought upon our hearts, will make every good wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy better, and every evill wee feele, not ſo bad. This latter branch ſhall be caſt into a ſecond Obſervation,</p>
               <p>Which may be this, <hi>To looke on evill as coming from the hand of God, will quiet the heart in bearing of evill. Shall wee receive good at the hand of God, and not evill?</hi> And this in two reſpects: Firſt, becauſe of the ſoveraignty of God, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupreame Lord, may doe what he will: and his will being the ſupreame rule of Juſtice, he can doe no wrong. This notion of God aſſures us, that whatſoever we receive from the hand of God, is juſt and right; hence the inference is naturall, If God ſend evill,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:98733:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I muſt receive it quietly, for he ſends it juſtly. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the aſſured faithfulneſſe, and love and goodneſſe of God to his, even when he ſends them (which are all he ſends) this ſort of evills. As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, any thing is welcome that cometh from one that loves me, and hath done me good, as God I know doth, and hath done often, and will doe for ever. Will not a man take a nominall evill kindly at his hand, from whom he hath received much reall good: While we looke only upon creatures and what they doe, the burthen of trouble is intollerable; but as it cometh from God, from a God that loveth us, we cannot but receive it in love. Afflictions coming from the creature, are as the rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon the ground, a biting, a ſtinging ſerpent: but conſidered in the hand of God, they are as the ſerpent in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> a rod to correct, and a ſtaffe to comfort us. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> we know fled from <hi>Saul</hi> in feare of his life; envious, bloody <hi>Saul</hi> had threatned to kill him. In his flight, <hi>David</hi> meetes with his beloved <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and ſaith unto him (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.8.) Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, <hi>if there be any iniquity in me, ſlay me thy ſelfe, for why ſhouldeſt thou bring me to thy father</hi>? He would die rather by the hand of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> then by the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> death from the hand of <hi>Ionathan</hi> who loved him, was ſweete; whereas from <hi>Saul,</hi> it had bin a bitter cup indeed. Take another inſtance. <hi>Elijah</hi> fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from <hi>Iezabel,</hi> 1 King. 19.4. and why doth he flie from her? <hi>She ſeekes my life,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to take it away.</hi> Thoughts of this preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him ſo hard, that when he came into the wilderneſſe (the text ſaith) <hi>hee ſate downe under a Juniper tree, and requeſted for himſelfe that he might die, and ſaid, It is enough now O Lord, take away my life.</hi> But <hi>Elijah</hi>; if thou be ſo willing to die, why doeſt thou flie from <hi>Jezabel?</hi> ſhe would have given thee thy wiſh preſently, and ſatisfied at once, her own malice, and thy longing: I but death from the hand of a <hi>Iezabel</hi> was his feare, not his deſire: He could welcome it from the hand of God, but not from the hand of a ſpightfull woman. But you will ſay, death is from the hand of God, though it come by the hand of the creature. True, but as every good we receive, is ſo much the more ſweete, by how much the more we ſee of the hand of God in it, and leſſe of the creature; ſo every evill is ſo much the more bitter, by how much we ſee leſſe of God, and more of man in it. If God will take away my life, I am pleaſed, but I beg deliverance from the hand of <hi>Iezabel:</hi> He fled for his life for feare of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> but he calleth upon God to die. We

               <p>But it may be objected, that I lately aſſign'd it as one reaſon, why Satan ſpared <hi>Jobs</hi> wife; namely, That ſhe who was his neereſt friend, being made an inſtrument of his affliction, the affliction might be more afflictive and vexatious, And <hi>David</hi> complaines moſt of a friend, that ſmote him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, when love turnes to hatred, and friendſhip to unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, when former kiſſes (like that preſent one of <hi>Judas</hi>) are changed into trecherie; this is very wounding and grievous indeed. But when God ſtrikes his friends, he is their friend ſtill, when he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, it is in faithfulneſſe, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75.) He is good to us, when he ſends us evill, and he ſends us evill, for our good. To be ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a friend whoſe very ſmiting is friendſhip, and who heales us by wounding cannot be offenſive. Hence <hi>Davids</hi> choice, <hi>Let us fall now into the hands of the Lord (for his mercies are great) and not into the hand of man,</hi> 1 Sam. 24.14.</p>
               <p>Hence a third Obſervation from the ſtrength of the argument and reaſon, may be thus framed. <hi>To conſider that all the good we have, deſcends from God, makes it both reaſonable and equitable, that wee ſhould beare evill quietly when he is pleaſed to ſend it. Shall we receive good and not evill?</hi> ſaith he, It is <hi>Solomons</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, (Eccleſ. 7.14.) <hi>In the day of prosperity be joyfull, but in the day of adverſitie conſider.</hi> What ſhall we conſider? Conſider this, and marke it well, that as the day of proſperity was from God, ſo the day of adverſitie is from God likewiſe; for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>God alſo hath ſet the one over against the other.</hi> Therefore ſeeing God hath ſet one over againſt the other, thou muſt take the one well, as well as the other; at leaſt thou muſt beare the latter as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, as thou did'ſt receive the former joyfully. They who have ſhared with others in gaines, thinke it but equall to ſhare with them in loſſes; they ſet the one over againſt the other. And ſo muſt we in reſpect of Gods diſpenſations towards us. If we ſet our preſent wants, over againſt our former fullneſſe, our preſent ſorrowes, over againſt our former comforts, our preſent ſickneſſe over againſt our former health, our preſent warre, over againſt our
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98733:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
former peace; If we thus ſet the one over againſt the other, our accounts will be ballanc'd, yea our former receipts of good, will be far greater, and out-ballance our preſent ſufferings of evill. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we remember, that we never deſerved the leaſt part of the good we have received, but we have deſerved more then all the evill that we ſuffer. Wee may ſay as <hi>Ezra</hi> did, (Chap. 9.13.) <hi>Thou our God haſt puniſhed us leſſe then our iniquities</hi>; and we may ſay as <hi>Jacob</hi> (Gen. 32.10.) <hi>Lord we are not worthy the leaſt of all thy mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This argument may be of great uſe to us of this Nation, in theſe times of darkeneſſe and feare. What? ſhall not we receive evill from the hand of God, who have received ſo much good? we have received many yeares of peace from God, foure-ſcore yeares of peace; ſhall we receive ſo many yeares of peace, from the hands of God, and ſhall we take it ill, if we receive ſome yeares of warre? We have received many yeares of plenty, ſhall we take it ill if we ſhould have ſome yeares of ſcarcitie? We have had the Goſpell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, every one ſitting under his Vine, and under his Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree; what, if now, we hold the Goſpell ſtanding upon our guard, or marching in the field? what if we hold it a while, ſitting in Tents, and ſtanding under our diſplayed banners?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Foraſmuch as the ſame word, is applied here to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the act of the mind in reference both to good and evill, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. <hi>That outward evills are to be received in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with the ſame mind that good things are received with.</hi> Yet a caution is to be given in with this. There are two ſorts of outward evils or ſufferings: Sinne is the cauſe of ſome ſufferings, and grace is the cauſe of other ſufferings, either grace acted or grace to be tryed. Now we are not to receive the evill of ſuffering, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſin is the cauſe, with the ſame mind as we doe good; joy and cheerefulneſſe doth not become ſuch evills. But when our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are cauſed by grace, either of thoſe wayes, then it becomes us to rejoyce. The Apoſtle ſaith more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>We glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation.</hi> And againe, (2 Cor. 6.10.) <hi>as ſorrowfull, yet alway rejoycing.</hi> The ſorrow of godly men is like the joy of the wicked: only in appearance; <hi>Paul</hi> had only a ſhadow of ſorrow, as ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but his joy was ſubſtantiall and continuall, <hi>alwayes rejoycing,</hi> though his outward eſtate caſt up, amounted but to this, <hi>poore, and having nothing.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe God is the ſame in all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of our eſtates: God loves as well when we are poore, as when
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:98733:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we are rich, yea as well, when himſelfe ſmites, as when he heales. He is as good to us when we receive evill, as when we receive good: therefore if God be the ſame, ſurely we ought to be the ſame too, and take it as kindly at his hands, when we are impoveriſht, as when we are inricht, when we are ſick, as when we are in health, when we are in priſon, as when we are free. Shall preſent evills make us either inſenſible of, or unthankfull for paſt mercies? Shall preſent troubles be as a grave wherein to bury the memory of all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer comforts? ſhall (as it was in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dreame) <hi>the leane kine, and the blasted eares of corne, eate up and devoure the fat kine, and the full eares?</hi> The Heathen Philoſopher cenſures him for a foole,<note place="margin">

And he brands him as unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, who accounts the end of a mercy, an injury; or thinks he is wrong'd, when free gifts are not continued. If a Heathen ſaw ſo much obligation, in the paſt benefits of a man; Chriſtians ſhould ſee it much more in the paſt mercies and bleſſings of their God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to conclude this point, with the counſell of the Ancient. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the heapes of good things received, weigh the good and the evill together: Thou ſhalt never find any mans life, at all times alike; It is the priviledge of God alone to be without changes: but if thou grieveſt at what is preſent, take comfort in what is paſt: Now thou mourneſt, but heretofore thou didſt rejoyce: now thou art in want, but thou haſt had aboundance. We have a ſaying. <hi>It is a miſerable thing to have been happy:</hi> But a godly man is happy in the mid'ſt of all his miſery: he may ſay with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted <hi>Luther, Let him be miſerable that can be miſerable, I cannot.</hi> He that hath not a God to looſe, nor a ſoule to looſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be miſerable, whatſoever he looſes; while Chriſt is ſafe, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever hath no reaſon to be unſatisfied. Thus we have diſcus'd <hi>Jobs</hi> anſwer, and have found it full of wiſedome and of holineſſe; like thoſe words of the Wiſe, which the Preacher ſaith (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.11.) <hi>are as goads, and as nailes faſtned by the Maſters of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. Jobs</hi> words were as goads by the ſharpneſſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, to awake and quicken lazie drones; they were as nailes by the piercing efficacy and ſtrength of reaſon, to confirme and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten wavering minds.</p>
               <p>We have the word and warrant of God for this, in that high Elogium, or commendation given him at the concluſion of all.</p>

                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:98733:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>In all this did not <hi>Job</hi> ſinne with his lips.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> reprooves his wife for ſpeaking ſo, and he refutes what ſhe had ſpoken; in both he hits the right: Now <hi>In all this did not</hi> Job <hi>ſinne with his lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſame teſtimony for the matter, and almoſt the ſame in words, with that, given of <hi>Jobs</hi> victory, in the cloſe of the firſt dayes battell; and having explicated them in that place, I ſhall but briefely touch them here. <hi>In all this did not</hi> Job <hi>ſin with his lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee in generall, the holy Ghoſt gives the victory to <hi>Job.</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is foiled, his plot failes, the weapons of his war-fare are all broken and ſucceſſeleſſe; all his fiery darts are either quench't or beaten back upon himſelfe: <hi>Job</hi> ſtands like a mighty rock, or like a houſe built upon the rock, unſhaken, unmoved: He that is held up by everlaſting armes, ſhall ſtand faſt for ever. <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words referre to what was paſt; For <hi>Job</hi> afterward did faile and ſinned with his lips; through vehemency of paine, and heate of diſputation, he ſpake ſome things raſhly, though nothing blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly: So he confeſſes, Chap. 42.13. <hi>I have uttered things that I underſtood not. But in all this,</hi> ſo farre as <hi>Job</hi> had gone, <hi>he had not ſinned with his lips.</hi> As <hi>Samuel</hi> after many victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and deliverances, ſets up a ſtone or a pillar with this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Eben-Ezer,</hi> The ſtone of helpe, ſaying, <hi>Hitherto hath the Lord helped us</hi> (1 Sam. 7.12.) So here the holy Ghoſt doth (as it were) erect a pillar, raiſe a monument of <hi>Jobs</hi> compleate and glorious victories over Satan, Thus engraven, <hi>Hitherto, In all this</hi> Job <hi>hath not ſinned.</hi> Yet you may remember, that ſuch ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches concerning the Saints, are to be underſtood in a qualified ſenſe, not in an abſolute ſenſe. For, <hi>who can bring a cleane thing out of that, which is uncleane?</hi> Perfection out of imperfection? Not to ſin, is here our duty, and ſhould be our endeavour, it ſhall be our reward in Heaven. On earth we are ſaid not to ſin, when we deſire not to ſin; as hath bin more at large ſhewed upon thoſe words of the laſt <hi>verſe</hi> of the former Chapter, <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> There reade the point handled more diſtinctly. For the opening of theſe words, note only this; that when it is ſaid, <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not:</hi> There is more to be underſtood, then is expreſt; for <hi>Job</hi> did not only not ſin, but he overcame, and triumphed gloriouſly over Satan: he did excellently,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98733:155"/>
and he ſpake excellently in all this; So then, theſe words carry the ſenſe not only of a bare acqittall, but of a high approbation:
<q>In all this <hi>Job</hi> ſinned not with his lips.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With his lips.</hi> Some of the <hi>Jewes</hi> inferre from hence, that he ſinned in his heart; becauſe it is ſaid, he did not ſin in words, they conceit there was ſome irregularity in his thoughts. Surely if his heart had been diſorder'd, his tongue would have been diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd too; <hi>for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,</hi> therefore it is rather an argument that his heart was free from ſin, becauſe his tongue was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not with his lips.</hi> That is, he did not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, or repine, or blaſpheme; theſe are the ſins of the lips.</p>
               <p>Obſerve firſt; <hi>Not to ſinne, is the higheſt and trueſt, the moſt honourable and lasting victory of all.</hi> This victory God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe applauds, the holy Ghoſt will cry you up for ſtrength and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, when you come off from a temptation untouch't; you ſhall be recorded for it among Chriſts worthies, <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſecondly, <hi>To governe the tongue under great and ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, is a high act of grace:</hi> It is ſpoken as matter of wonder; <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not with his lips. Moſes,</hi> you know, was a meeke man, yet he was ſo put to it, <hi>that he spake unadviſedly with his lips</hi>; He opened his lips ſo unadviſedly, that God ſhut him out of the temporall <hi>Canaan</hi> for it: <hi>raſh words coſt him deare. David</hi> was a very holy man, and very carefull over his tongue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. <hi>I ſaid I will take heed to my wayes, that I ſinne not with my tongue. I will keepe my mouth with a bridle:</hi> And knowing (though as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> teacheth us, <hi>we put bits into the Horſes mouthes that they may obey us, we can turne about their whole body,</hi> Jam. 3.3) that no bridle of his putting could keepe his mouth; he puts this worke into the hand of God, praying with all earneſtneſſe; <hi>Set a watch (O Lord) before my mouth: keepe the doore of my lips.</hi> Notwithſtanding all this, we find him ſinning with his lips more then once, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13. <hi>Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vaine, and waſhed my hands in innocency.</hi> And againe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. <hi>I ſaid in my hast all men are lyars. Job</hi> had the preheminence in this, <hi>he ſinned not with his lips,</hi> no not when he was afflicted and ſmitten with bitter words: <hi>He that offendeth not in words</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James) is a perfect man</hi>;
<pb n="003" facs="tcp:98733:155"/>
he is a perfect man indeed, who can rule his tongue, and ſo keepe the doore of his lips, as that he offends not either by ſilence or by ſpeech. The lips doe offend both wayes, negatively as well as poſitively, by ſpeaking, and by not ſpeaking: Sometimes <hi>ſilence is a loud ſinne,</hi> not ſpeaking is to ſome, on ſome occaſions, a crying ſin; <hi>Job</hi> ſinned not with his lips, either by being ſilent when he ſhould ſpeake, or by ſpeaking wherein and when he ſhould be ſilent. And ſo much concerning this ſecond conſequent of <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction; His wives ſinfull counſell, with his prudent and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwer; ſharpely, yet moderately rebuking; ſtrongly, yet lovingly convincing her folly: In and by both, faithfully indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring at once to diſcover and cure her errour.</p>
               <p>The third conſequent of his affliction now followes, namely the viſit of his friends, deſcribed in the three laſt verſes of this Chapter, which leads us into the body of the Booke, with all the debates, diſputes and arguments held and maintained with much acuteneſſe of wit, and ſtrength of reaſoning between him and theſe three, his friends and viſitants.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, We have the ground of this viſit. It was a mutuall agreement, or a compact made betweene them, ſo ſaith the text, <hi>For they had made an appointment together to come.</hi>

               <p>The former of theſe two ends, <hi>viz.</hi> their mourning with him, we have largely ſet downe in the two latter <hi>verſes</hi>; they put that end into act preſently, as ſoone as they came, they fell a mourning with him.

               <p>The firſt act is this, <hi>They wept.</hi> And to ſhew that it was no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary weeping, the Text ſaith, <hi>They lift up their voice and wept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond act of their mourning was, their renting of their Mantles, <hi>And they rent every one his Mantle.</hi>

               <p>The third act was, the <hi>ſprinckling of duſt upon their heads,</hi> and <hi>the ſprinckling of duſt toward Heaven,</hi> which was another aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating circumſtance of their ſorrow.</p>
               <p>The fourth act was, their <hi>ſitting downe with him upon the ground, ſeven dayes, and ſeven nights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth act of their mourning with him, was their ſilence, <hi>And none ſpake a word unto him.</hi>

               <p>The Cauſe or the reaſon of this ſolemnity in their mourning, the reaſon of theſe 5.

But uſually, it is put ſtrictly, for a ſpeciall <hi>friend,</hi> as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6. when he ſpeakes of inticers to Idolatry, <hi>If thy friend</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who is as thine owne ſoule</hi>; there is the ſame word, and he ſhewes by a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution, whom he meanes by ſuch a <hi>friend,</hi> namely ſuch a one, who is as <hi>thine own ſoule</hi>; one that lieth in thy boſome, and is as neere and deare to thee, as thy ſelfe. I ſuppoſe here in this place, <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends, were not friends at large, but intimate and ſpeciall friends, or (as we uſe to ſay) boſome friends. And therefore when it is ſaid, Jobs <hi>three friends,</hi> we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, as if <hi>Job</hi> had but three, as if theſe were all the friends <hi>Iob</hi> had; but amongſt all his friends, theſe carried away the name, theſe were the chiefe and choice; Jobs <hi>three friends</hi>; As it is ſaid concerning <hi>Davids</hi> Worthies, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23, <hi>David</hi> had many Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, but there was <hi>a firſt three,</hi> a chiefe three among them all.

               </p>
               <p>The occaſion of this viſit, preſents it ſelfe next, <hi>When theſe three friends heard of all this evill that was come upon</hi> Job. <hi>When they heard of it.</hi> The troubles of <hi>Iob</hi> were noyſed all the Country

               <p>When this report about <hi>Iob</hi> came to them, they came to <hi>Iob.

It is frequently aſſerted by the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Doctors, with whom the Septuagint agree, and moſt of the Jeſuits are in it to; that theſe <hi>three friends</hi> of <hi>Iob</hi> were Kings, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Reges</hi> or <hi>Reguli,</hi> ſuch as had the governement of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they lived.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Beza</hi> rejects this as a Fable, and telleth us that this opinion hath no footing or foundation in Scripture, but is grounded only upon that uſuall boldneſſe of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Doctors.

This is cleare, that they were great men, eminent perſons in their Country: and the diſputes which follow, teſtifie that they were men of very great wiſedome and underſtanding, according to all the learning of thoſe times.</p>
               <p>Theſe three friends of <hi>Job</hi> are here ſet forth by name, by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name. By the name firſt of their perſons.

                  </note>Firſt, <hi>They came to mourne with him.</hi> The word which we tranſlate, <hi>to mourne,</hi> ſignifieth to move the body, or to paſſe from place to place. <hi>Cain</hi> (after that ſinne of his in murthering his Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.) hath this judgement paſs'd by God upon him, <hi>that he ſhould be a fugitive and a vagabond,</hi> he ſhould be <hi>Nod,</hi> a mover from place to place; and afterwards it is ſaid, <hi>he dwelt in the Land of</hi> Nod; which ſome interpret for a ſpeciall place, for a Country called <hi>Nod:</hi> but it is taken by others thus, <hi>hee dwelt in the Land of</hi> Nod, that is, where ever he dwelt, he found the Land as it were moving, it was a moving, a ſhaking, a trembling Land to him, <hi>He dwelt in the Land of</hi> Nod: His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience quaking continually, by reaſon of the guilt that was upon him, for murdering his Brother, the earth alſo, ſeemed to quake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, whereſoever he went or dwelt. <hi>That only by the way.</hi> The ſame word here uſed in the Text, by a Metaphor, ſignifies to mourne or compaſſionate the afflictions and miſeries of another. So, <hi>Nah.</hi> 3.6. Nineveh <hi>is laid waſt, who will be moane her?</hi> And Iſa. 51.19. <hi>Theſe two things are come unto thee, who ſhall be ſorry for thee?</hi> And the reaſon why this word which ſignifieth properly to move, is tranſlated to ſignifie, mourning in compaſſion with others, may be, either firſt this; becauſe ſuch perſons will runne, goe or move from place to place, to give and adminiſter comfort to their friends, whoſe afflictions affect and grieve them, as we ſee here in theſe friends of <hi>Job</hi>; they took a long journey, they moved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when they came to mourne.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is ſaid they came <hi>to comfort him.</hi> The word which is there uſed to <hi>comfort,</hi> ſignifies likewiſe to <hi>mourne:</hi>

                  </note> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the mournings of repentance, or to repent for ſin with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: the reaſon is given, becauſe true comfort doth ſpring from repentance; Joy often ariſeth out of ſorrow, and ſo the ſame word is applied to both. Worldly joy and ſorrow are contraries, but god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joy and ſorrow are con-cauſes, mutually effecting and helping one another.</p>
               <p>We have here an excellent patterne held forth unto us of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in reference unto diſtreſſed perſons or Nations.</p>
               <p>Firſt thus, <hi>It is both an act and an argument of true friendſhip, to mourne with and comfort thoſe that are in affliction.</hi> A man doth then ſet his ſeale to it, that he is a friend, when he will partake and ſhare in his friends afflictions; when he will divide with him in all eſtates whatſoever it is, whether ſweet or ſowre, joy or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, he will have his part. Many friends will come and rejoyce with you, they will come to a feaſt with you, they will meete at a houſe of mirth with you; but they fall off and goe backe; when they muſt weepe with you, when if they come, they muſt come to a houſe of mourning. <hi>Solomon (Prov.</hi> 17.17.) gives us the true character of a friend, <hi>A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is borne for adverſitie.</hi> It is the note and triall of our love to God, when we love him at all times, what ever he doth with us: And it is the argument of true love unto our bretheren, when we love and owne them at all times, whatſoever they endure from the hand of God, or man: This Chriſt approves and commends in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:98733:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Yee are they</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who have continued with me in my temptation.</hi> It is an eaſie peece of friendſhip or diſcipleſhip, to continue with Chriſt at a feaſt, or at a full Table; but in a temptation to continue with him, ſpeakes a Diſciple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Some friends are like the Swallow, they come in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and ſing with you, but when it is Winter, cold and froſt, then farewell, they muſt ſeeke a warmer climate. Theſe are ſummer friends, while the ſummer of comfort, the ſummer of riches, the ſummer of outward contentment laſteth, you cannot be rid of them: but if the winter come, the winter of trouble, and ſorrow, and poverty, and ſickneſſe, they are gone; they will not once look on you, they paſſe on the other ſide of the way, as the Levite did when he ſaw the man lye wounded and weltring in his blood, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.32. <hi>theſe are ſummer friends, not winter friends,</hi> not</p>
               <p>Secondly obſerve this, As it is an act and an argument of friend- they. ſhip to doe thus, ſo it is likewiſe a duty to doe thus; <hi>It is a duty to mourne with thoſe that mourne, and to viſit thoſe that are in affliction.</hi> Many looke upon it only as a complement, to viſit their ſad friends, we muſt looke upon it as a duty. Chriſt puts it (<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.36.) as one of thoſe viſible acts of duty, upon which he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the bleſſing of that great day, <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> why? <hi>I was ſick and ye viſited me.</hi> Chriſt is not ſick in his perſon, he is in Heaven, where is no ſin, and therefore no ſickneſſe ſhall ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and indeed he never was ſick in his perſon, when he was here upon the earth; Chriſt did not beare our perſonall infirmities, he bore only our naturall infirmities: I know it is ſaid, <hi>he bore our ſickneſſes</hi> (by compaſſion and by compenſation) but he was not ſick; Whereas then Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I was ſick,</hi> he meanes ſick in his members; And when he ſaith, <hi>ye viſited me,</hi> he meanes his ſick diſtreſſed ſervants; he takes it ſo kindly, when done to his, that he reckons it as done to himſelfe: It is an act you ſee and an office of love, upon which Chriſt hath a ſpeciall eye. The Apoſtle <hi>James, (chap.</hi> 1.27.) doth as it were put all Religion in this: It is ſuch a fruit of Religion as doth evidence the truth of Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath obtained not only the name of Religion, but is made the defenition of Religion· <hi>Pure Religion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and undefiled before God the Father, is this.</hi> What is it? <hi>To viſit the fatherleſſe and the widdow in their affliction.</hi> This is a definition from the effect: It is not put in generall, that <hi>to viſit the fatherleſſe and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:98733:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the widdow,</hi> but to viſit them <hi>in their affliction,</hi> is <hi>pure Religion</hi>; that is, this is a fruit, that which groweth up from the roote of pure Religion: if pure Religion live in the heart, this will be a fruit in the life. Wherefore looke not upon the viſitation of a diſconſolate friend, as a matter of indifferency, but of duty; and doe it not only for love, but for conſcience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The text ſaith, <hi>as ſoone as they heard,</hi> or <hi>when they heard of all the evill that was come upon</hi> Job, <hi>they came to mourne with him.</hi> Then Obſerve:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The very report of an others ſuffering, ſhould move us to mourne and ſuffer with him.</hi> Report ſhould bring us, when we doe but heare of ſuch a thing: It is very unwarrantable to judge or cenſure a friend upon report and heare-ſay; but a report is warrant enough to pitty and pray for him, to viſit and comfort him. <hi>Remember them that are in bonds</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle,) <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3. <hi>as bound with them:</hi> Remember them. Remembrance is of things and perſons which are abſent; remember them, though you ſee them not, though abſent from you, yet make their caſe as preſent; <hi>be as bound with them, be as afflicted with them,</hi> yea haſten into their preſence. <hi>Beare one anothers burthens,</hi> Gal. 6.2. <hi>Rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and weepe with them that weepe,</hi> Rom. 12.5. <hi>Be ye all of one mind, having compaſſion one of another,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.8. are Apoſtolicall rules for, and tryals of Goſpell-love. It was a ſad condition that <hi>David</hi> was in; and it was a very ſinfull condition that others about him were in, when he ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.20. <hi>I looked for ſome to take pitty, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none.</hi> But if it be ſinfull not to eaſe (when it is in our power) the ſorrowes of others, how ſinfull is it to adde to their ſorrow? Such, <hi>David</hi> found (typing Chriſt in his ſufferings) <hi>who gave him gall for meate, and in his thirst they gave him vinegar to drinke.</hi> Thus the Lord complaines of thoſe Heathen by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zacharie,</hi> (Zach. 1.15.) <hi>I was but a little displeaſed with my people, and they helped forward the affliction.</hi>

               <p>Againe, If it be a duty to mourne over the afflictions of others; how exceeding ſinfull is it to rejoyce at the afflictions of others? This was <hi>Edoms</hi> wickedneſſe, reproved by the Prophet <hi>Obadiah,</hi> verſ, 12. <hi>Thou ſhouldeſt not have looked on the day of thy brother, in the day that he became a stranger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither ſhouldeſt thou have rejoyced over the children of</hi> Judah, <hi>in the day of their affliction: neither ſhouldeſt thou have spoken proudly, in the day of diſtreſſe.</hi>

                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:98733:160"/>We may further preſſe this point, in reference unto the preſent condition of our bretheren in many places of this Nation, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the whole Nation of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yea of the whole Church of God: Are they not all mourners? And if we are to mourne with private friends, much more then with publick, with whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Churches. We may beſpeake all paſſengers in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Prophet <hi>Jeremie,</hi> lamenting over the deſolations of Jeruſalem, <hi>Is it nothing to you, all you that paſſe by</hi> England, <hi>Ireland?</hi> Is it nothing to you that travell, (though but in meditation) into the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>Germanie?</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>Amos</hi> 6. <hi>Who ſate upon beds of Ivory, and ſtretched themſelves upon their couches, who eate the lambs out of the flocke, and the calves out of the midſt of the ſtall: Who chaunted to the ſound of the viol, and invented to themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of muſick like</hi> David, <hi>who dranke wine in bowles, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed themſelves with the chiefe ointments, but they were not grieved for the affliction of</hi> Joſeph. If ever that of <hi>Solomon</hi> were appliable, it is to ſuch a time as this, (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>I ſaid of laughter thou art mad,</hi> of all wordly laughter and outward mirth, what do'ſt thou? if ever it were mad, now it is mad: Now ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is ſobriety, and teares are in ſeaſon. No ſong ſo muſicall as that which is ſet to the higheſt ſtraine of lamentation. I remember the Prophet <hi>Eliſha's</hi> paſſion, when he fore-ſaw evills that ſhould be acted; he looked upon <hi>Hazael,</hi> ſaith the Text, (2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.11.) and wept; and <hi>Hazael</hi> ſaid, <hi>Why weepeth my Lord?</hi> he replied, <hi>Becauſe I know of all the evill that thou wilt doe unto the children of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>their strong holds wilt thou ſet on fire, and their young men wilt thou ſlay with the ſword, and wilt daſh their children, and rip up their women with-child.</hi> This made him weepe, he wept, becauſe he ſaw blood and fire, murders and burnings in the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:98733:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
face of <hi>Hazael</hi>; what would he have done then, if he had ſeene all fulfilled with his hand? Chriſt himſelfe wept over <hi>Jeruſalam,</hi> when he propheſied how the <hi>enemy ſhould come, and caſt a trench about it, and compaſſe the City round, and keepe them in on every ſide,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.43. If Chriſt wept for the evills that were to come on others, how ſhould we weepe for the evills that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come upon us? <hi>Mine eye affecteth my heart,</hi> ſaith lamenting <hi>Jeremie</hi> (Lam. 3.51.) An eye of propheſie hath affected ſome hearts, and ſhall not an eye of ſenſe affect ours? Our eares were ſmitten long agoe, with ſad meſſages out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> out of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> we were ſmitten nearer home by the reports of thoſe inhumane butcheries, exerciſed upon our bretheren in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; We are now ſmitten at home, both eare and eye, the ſword hath paſs'd the Seas, and hath ſpilt rivers, is like to ſpill a ſea of blood out of our own bowels; for our bretheren that have beene ſlaine, for our bretheren that are in captivity, for our bretheren that have been ſpoiled, let us mourne and lament with a brotherly lamentation. It is true, <hi>they ought</hi> (as thoſe ancient worthies) <hi>to ſuffer joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods,</hi> Heb. 10.34. but we ought to grieve when they ſuffer the ſpoiling of their goods. It is an excellent ſpirit in them, to ſuffer it with joy, but it is a ſinfull ſpirit in us, which rejoyceth, when they ſuffer. Some Trees keepe their greeneſſe and their leaves, winter and ſummer, let the time be what it will, hot or cold, they are alike freſh and greene: Some ſpirits are like thoſe hard-grain'd trees: But the ſpirit of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould be like ordinary trees, which when winter cometh, caſt their leaves, put off their beauty and bravery. The ſtory ſaith of <hi>Nero,</hi> that when he had ſet the City of <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, he got him up to an high place, to behold the fire, and feed upon the flame, for there and then he ſung ſongs of the deſtruction of <hi>Troy:</hi> To ſing ſongs, to rejoyce in the middeſt of <hi>Sions</hi> afflictions, argues not a Chriſtian, but a <hi>Neronian</hi> ſpirit. To ſhut up this point, let us preferre <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> above our chiefeſt worldly joy; let us even reſolve to enjoy nothing of the world, till we ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a quiet habitation, and the joy of the whole earth. The wife of <hi>Phineas,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. would not enjoy her ſon, (and that is the chiefeſt joy) <hi>becauſe the Arke of God was taken:</hi> She enquires, <hi>where is the glory?</hi> as if ſhe had ſaid, you ſhew me a ſon, but can you ſhew me the glory? No, <hi>The glory is departed from</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for the Arke of God is taken.</hi> There is nothing in the world to be rejoyced in,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:98733:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when God departs from us; and there is but little, if any thing, to be rejoyced in, when Ordinances (which are the ſignes of Gods preſence, and the meanes of communion with God) are taken or departing from us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Theſe friends of <hi>Iob</hi> came to mourne with him; they were not ſent for, they were not invited by letters or meſſengers, but they came of their own accord. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It becomes us well for the comforting of our friends, to prevent the invitation of our friends.</hi> Some out of a kind of modeſty (that is the beſt we can ſay of it) will not come to a troubled friend, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be ſent for. I doe aſſure you this, <hi>it is good manners to be an unbidden gueſt at a houſe of mourning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another thing I would offer to you from hence, is this; It is ſaid, that before they came, <hi>they made an appointment to come, to mourne with him and to comfort him</hi>; you ſee they agreed upon their end, before they ſet a foote in the way. Note this then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is an excellent point of holy prudence, to be ſetled about our end, before we undertake or enter upon any action.</hi> Some goe about buſineſſe, and they know not why, they viſit their friends, and they know not for what. That was juſtly called a confuſed aſſembly (<hi>Acts</hi> 19.32.) when the moſt part knew not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were come together. Though no man can know the end of his action, reſpecting the event, yet every wiſe man doth and ought to know the end of all his actions, in reſpect of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment: His end is firſt intended, though it be laſt, yea though it be not all attained. Obſerve further,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wiſdom doth not only propoſe an end, but a ſutable end. Iobs</hi> three friends propoſed two of the moſt ſutable ends that could be for ſuch a buſineſſe, <hi>To mourne with him and to comfort him.</hi> If a man were to viſit or converſe with a wicked man, it were good to ſay, I will goe to counſell him, to convince him of his ſin, to convert him from his ſin. If I goe to to one who is full of doubts, it were beſt to ſay, I will goe ſee, if I can ſettle and reſolve him: A ſutable end, is the beauty and grace of all our undertakings.</p>
               <p>Againe, Conſider the order and method of theſe two ends, it is ſaid, <hi>they came to mourne with him, and to comfort him.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is the higher and the nobler end, the laſt and ultimate end in regard of man; it is the end into which all actions are reſolved, and all ends emptied at the laſt; all the acts of holineſſe have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency unto joy; all godly ſorrow leads unto comfort: Therefore
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:98733:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Apoſtle writes to his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he was not glad, becauſe he had made them ſorrowfull by an Epiſtle, but that they ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo, as they might rejoyce. How was that? They ſorrowed to repentance, their ſorrow wrought <hi>repentance unto ſalvation, not to be repented of.</hi> But is there no more in true repentance, but only this, that it is not to be repented of? Surely yes. For if there be <hi>joy in Heaven</hi> (Luk. 15.) <hi>over a repenting ſinner,</hi> then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, there is aboundant ground of joy on earth. If Angels rejoyce when a ſinner repents, much more may the repenting ſinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. So then repentance, not to be repented of, is repentance greatly to be rejoyced in. Repentance that brings not forth joy, is to be repented of: We muſt mourne for all ſorrowes which end in ſorrow; for ſorrow is not good for its own ſake, but for comforts ſake: <hi>Iobs</hi> friends came not to mourne with him, that he might mourne, but they came to mourne with him, that he might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: To adde ſorrow unto ſorrow, is to be ſwallowed up with ſorrow; he ſorrowes rightly, that would be ſwallowed up with joy. You ſee the ends which theſe men propoſed in comming to <hi>Iob, to mourne with him and to comfort him.</hi> Excellent ends both, and without all queſtion, they did propoſe and purpoſe them ſincerely. They came to mourne with him, and they mourned; they came with hearts reſolved to comfort him, but they did not comfort him, they did not attaine that end, they could not attaine it; Then Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That as the way of a man is not in himſelfe, ſo much leſſe is the end of a man in himſelfe. The way of a man is not in himſelfe,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> Cap. 10.23. that is, a mans actions are not in his own power, he is not maſter of his own will, or of his own way. If a mans way be not in himſelfe, muchleſſe is his end in himſelfe, that is, in his own power, to have what end he pleaſeth and propoſeth. <hi>Man propoſeth, but God diſpoſeth.</hi> Theſe friends came to comfort <hi>Iob,</hi> but they did nothing leſſe then comfort him: In ſtead of comforting, they afflicted him; which forced him to complaine, <hi>Miſerable comforters are ye all:</hi> And yet their errand was to comfort him.</p>
               <p>Some indeed are of opinion, that they were falſe friends, that they came upon him with prejudic'd and imbitter'd ſpirits: but the preparatory circumſtances, and manner of their coming, cleares the uprightneſſe of their intentions, and confutes that ſlander. Doubtleſſe they came really to comfort him, and eaſe his ſorrowes,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:98733:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and yet behold they doubled his ſorrowes, and proved a greater affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him then all the reſt. <hi>Job</hi> had nothing left him, but the integrity of his wayes, and the uprightneſſe of his heart; His eſtate was gone, his children were gone, his health was gone, his body was broken, he was undone quite, yet he had a heart-full of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. And when Satan the enemy could not ſtrip him of this, he ſends his wife: Firſt, to jeere him out of it; but he ſhakes her off quickly as a fooliſh woman: Secondly, hee ſends theſe friends, gravely and learnedly to diſpute and beate him out of it, by dint of argument. O how long did theſe hang upon him, with many ſerious and weighty, with many pious and divine (much miſapplied) diſcourſes: He could not get rid of theſe, whoſe words were as drawne ſwords, often making his wounded ſoule bleed and breath out ſad complaints; and yet they came to comfort him. <hi>A mans heart</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 16.9.) <hi>deviſeth his way, but the Lord directeth his steps.</hi> Man deviſeth, but God directeth: He orders the actions, and over-rules the ends of every creature. We can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cut out our way, nor make up our concluſions, by our own ſtrength or wiſedome. And ſo much for the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe,</hi> His friends viſit, <hi>They came unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told you before, that the two following <hi>verſes,</hi> doe but ſet forth the particulars of the firſt end, <hi>their mourning. They came to mourne with him:</hi> Their mourning is expreſſed by many of thoſe particular circumſtances, obſerved in <hi>Jobs</hi> ſorrow, <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 20. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not inſiſt much upon them.</p>
               <q>And when they lifted up their eyes afarre off they knew him not.</q>
               <p>This is the preface to the ſeverall acts of their mourning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when they lifted up their eyes.</hi> To lift up the eyes, is a frequent Scripture phraſe, for ſeeing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.63, 64. There is a reaſon in nature for it, man having a ſpeciall nerve in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the eye, by the motion of which, the eye turnes upward. I only offer that, becauſe the ſame word is uſed for lifting up the voice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Afarre off.</hi> Some hence inferre, that <hi>Job</hi> lay abroad; and they take this for a further argument; that he was put out of the City or houſe where he dwelt, as a Leper. But this <hi>afarre off,</hi> might be within the compaſſe of his own houſe, or in his chamber; as if it had been ſaid, as ſoone as they ſtept into the place where he lay, and eſpied him in ſuch a forlorne condition, they knew him not;
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:98733:162"/>
though it be not improbable that he was ſometime abroad for the benefit of the aire, by reaſon of the filthineſſe of his diſeaſe; and ſo his friends might find him abroad. But that he was turned out of his houſe, is refuted, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.13. where he ſpeakes of his bed, and of his couch. <hi>When I ſay my bed ſhall comfort me, my couch ſhall eaſe my complaint, &amp;c.</hi> That is, when I thought to find eaſe by lying downe upon my bed, or leaning on my couch; therefore he had a houſe furniſhed with bed and couch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When they lift up their eyes afarre off, they knew him not.</hi> We need not take it abſolutely, as if his diſeaſe had ſo disfigured him, that he could not be knowne to be the ſame man: For often in Scripture, that which is put as an abſolute negative, is intended for a weake affirmative. It is ſaid, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 1.11.) <hi>When Chriſt came, he came to his owne, and his owne received him not,</hi> there is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute negation, (yet it followeth,) <hi>But to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſonnes of God.</hi> His own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him not, yet ſome did receive him; Some of his own kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Country did receive him; So that, <hi>his own received him not,</hi> is as if it had bin ſaid, few of his own received him, or he had but cold entertainement among his owne. So <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.6. Ephraim <hi>is ſmitten, their roote is dried up, they ſhall beare no fruit.</hi> There is the ſound of an abſolute deniall, yet the ſenſe will beare a weake affirmation; for it followeth, <hi>yea though they bring forth, yet will I ſlay the beloved fruit of their wombe.</hi> They may bring forth a few or ſome fruit perhaps, but I will deſtroy it. So here, <hi>They knew him not,</hi> that is, they could ſcarſe diſcerne him, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh who he was, his diſeaſe and ſores had ſo diſcolour'd or blotted out the lines and feature of his face, that they could not ſuddainly aſſure themſelves, this was he. They ſtood as men ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; What? Is this <hi>Job?</hi> What a ſpectacle is here? How ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is his viſage changed, and his whole body disfigured? Such kind of doubting language, doubtleſſe paſt amongſt them. <hi>When they ſaw him afarre off, they knew him not.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> obſerves the like, after the hard ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him thus to lament, (<hi>chap.</hi> 4.7, 8.) <hi>Her Nazarites were purer then ſnow, they were whiter then milke, they were more ruddie in body then Rubies, their poliſhing was of Saphire:</hi> But ſee the change; <hi>Their viſage is blacker then a coale, they are not knowne in the ſtreetes.</hi> Famine had eaten up, not only their fleſh, but their forme, miſery had altered their very complexion and viſage; they
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:98733:163"/>
who ſhined before like Rubies and Saphires for colour and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, were now darke as a coale, or dusky like aſhes, they were not knowne to be the ſame men and women. It is ſaid of Chriſt in his affliction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.14. <hi>That his viſage was ſo marred, more then any man, and his forme more then the ſonnes of men.</hi> Great afflictions change the very forme, and utterly blaſt the beauty of the body. Sinne doth ſo change the ſoule, and disfigure the mind, it ſo deformes the ſpirit, and defaces the image, at firſt ſtampt upon it; that God ſaith, <hi>I know you not,</hi> you are not like the men that Imade. But this is the comfort of a <hi>Job,</hi> of a godly man, that when his face is moſt deformed, his ſoule is moſt beautified; and though a diſeaſe may disfigure him, ſo that his neereſt friends know him not, yet God knowes him ſtill; No ſickneſſe can weare out the markes by which Chriſt knowes thee. When thy face is blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then a coale, he ſees the face of thy ſoule, ſhining like the face of an Angell. A perſon or a people are then in a wofull condition indeed, when God ſhall ſay to them, as he did to thoſe hipocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call profeſſors, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Depart from me, I know ye not.</hi> We may be in ſuch a wofull condition, that our friends and acquaintance coming to viſit us, cannot know us; yet for the maine, well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, bleſſed enough at that time, beautifull in the eye, welcome into the preſence of a glorious God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They knew him not.</hi> What then? <hi>Then they lifted up their voice and wept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the firſt act of their mourning. And we may obſerve five acts of mourning here ſpecified, whereof one is a naturall act, and the other foure are ceremoniall. The naturall act was this of weeping, <hi>They lifted up their voice and wept.</hi> The ceremoniall acts were theſe: Firſt, <hi>They rent every one his mantle.</hi> Secondly, <hi>They sprinckled duſt upon their heads towards Heaven.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>They ſate downe with him on the ground, ſeven dayes, and ſeven nights.</hi> The fourth ceremoniall act was, their ſilence, <hi>And none spake a word unto him, for they ſaw that his griefe was great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>They lifted up their voice and wept.</hi> The word is <hi>Baca,</hi> and from that, the place <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.5. is called <hi>Bochin,</hi> where the people are ſaid to lift up their voice and weepe, when the Angell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.6. We reade of <hi>the valley of</hi> Baca, which ſome tranſlate, the valley of weeping, or the valley of teares; Others from <hi>Baca</hi> a Mulberry-tree, the valley of Mulberry-trees, which being a dry place, the travellers to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the ſolemne
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98733:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
feaſts, did ſo digge for water, that they made all as one well.</p>
               <p>Further, It is ſaid, they did not only <hi>weepe,</hi> but <hi>they lifted up their voice and wept.</hi> We may note two things in that phraſe. Firſt, the vehemency of their ſorrow, as when a man doth lift up his voice and ſpeake, he ſpeakes vehemently. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. <hi>Lift up thy voice like a trumpet,</hi> that is, ſpeake with a loud and ſtrong voice; So here, <hi>They lifted up their voice and wept,</hi> that is, they wept vehemently, they wept exceedingly. Secondly, To lift up the voice and weepe, notes the eaſing of the mind in ſorrow; for it is an eaſe to the mind burden'd and oppreſs'd with ſorrow, to lift up the voice and weepe; to cry out in ſorrow, lets the ſtrength of the ſorrow out. We ſay, that ſorrow which is included,<note place="margin">Strangulat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſus dolor.</note> ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles and ſtifles the ſpirit, ſorrow kept in, is like fire kept in, more augmented; As <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. concerning himſelfe, <hi>While I kept ſilence, even from good, my ſorrow was ſtirred, my heart was hot within me, while I was muſing, the fire burned.</hi> His ſorrow was increaſt, when he had not a vent for it; Silent mournings are the ſoreſt mournings: lifting up the voice, vents the ſorrow. The holy Ghoſt expreſſes great ſorrow, by that of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in travaile, crying out. To cry out, notes (I grant) great paine, and yet crying out is a leſtening or mitigation of paine. It is obſerved, that the Midwife ſeeing a travelling woman hold in, and conceale her paines, will bid her cry out. Some lift up their voice and weepe, when they are not in paine, when they mourne not at all: There are Crocodiles teares, teares and voices too of diſſimulation. <hi>Iſmael</hi> had teares in his eyes, and revenge in his heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 41. Others are in paine and mourne, when they lift not up their voice nor weepe: Like one that hath a deadly wound, they bleed inwardly: But when there is the higheſt flood of ſorrow in the heart, weeping will make an ebbe, and you may let much of thoſe waters (which are ready to drowne the ſpirit) out at thoſe ſluces of the eyes. That is the firſt act, the naturall act, <hi>They lifted up their eyes</hi> and ſaw ſuch a ſpectacle, as made them <hi>lift up their voice and weepe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are 4, ceremoniall acts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>They rent every man his mantle.</hi> We have ſpoken of that, when we opened the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> of the former <hi>Chapter,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the grounds of rending cloathes, ſorrow, indignation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall referre you thither for further information in this point.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ceremoniall act of their ſorrow was, <hi>The sprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:98733:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
duſt upon their heads toward Heaven.</hi> In the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> of the former <hi>Chapter,</hi> Job <hi>ſhaved his head:</hi> Here is another cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>They ſprinckled dust upon their heads</hi>; And which is yet more conſiderable, <hi>They ſprinckled duſt toward Heaven</hi>; There were two wayes of ſprinckling duſt. There was firſt a taking the duſt and ſprinckling it upon the head barely; And then there was another way of taking the duſt and throwing it up in the aire, and ſo letting it fall upon the head; This act was ſignificative, It ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that all things were full of ſorrowfull confuſion, the earth and the aire were mingled, the Heavens alſo were cloudy and darkened, therefore they caſt duſt toward Heaven; For as by a ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my wind and tempeſt, the duſt is raiſed, which thickens the aire, and obſcures the Heavens; ſo by that act of caſting or ſprinckling duſt in the aire, ſtormy, tempeſtuous and troubleſome times were ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. In the <hi>Acts, (chap.</hi> 22.23.) thoſe wretched <hi>Jewes</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached, being vexed and enraged, <hi>cryed out, and caſting off their cloathes, threw duſt into the aire:</hi> Their action had this voice in it: This man hath, or will, if let alone, fill all the world with trouble, and diſturbe the peace of Nations. This they expreſſe (together with their own rage) by throwing duſt into the aire. It was a judgement, which God threatned his people with, that he would make the raine of their land duſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.24. And when men make it raine duſt, by ſprinckling it towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it ſhewed great trouble or judgement upon themſelves, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Land. Further, the ſprinckling of duſt upon the head, was a <hi>memento</hi> of mortality. They put duſt to duſt, that man might remember himſelfe to be but duſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they ſate with him upon the ground, ſeven dayes and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nights.</hi> Here is the third ceremoniall act of their ſorrow. In the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> of the former Chapter, it is ſaid, Job <hi>fell upon the ground,</hi> theſe ſate upon the ground; As falling, ſo ſitting upon the ground, is the poſture of a mourner, of a mourner greatly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himſelfe under the hand of God, and the ſenſe of his own or other mens afflictions. When God layes us low, he can lay us lower, and therefore it is beſt for us, to lay our ſelves as low as we can: ſo doth he, who ſits upon the ground, if his heart ſit downe with him too. It is poſſible for the body to lye groveling upon the earth, when the ſpirit is neſtling among the ſtarres: not in faith, as the Saints doe, but in pride, as Lucifer did, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.13. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he either is, or appeares to be humbled to the loweſt, and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98733:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
emptied to the full, of worldly comforts, who, with <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, ſits downe upon the ground: eſpecially, if he ſit long there, as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends did, <hi>ſeven dayes and ſeven nights.</hi> The time ſeemes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incredible. How could they hold out to ſit ſo long? or how could <hi>Job,</hi> a ſick and diſeaſed man? For it is ſaid, <hi>They ſate downe with him, ſeven dayes,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, We need not interpret it for ſeven continued dayes and nights, without any intermiſſion; it is frequent in Scripture, to put a part, eſpecially a greater part, for the whole; that which is often done, is ſaid to be alwayes done, as, Luk. 24.53. <hi>The Diſciples were continually in the Temple, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and bleſſing God</hi>; And <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.37. It is ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Anna <hi>the Propheteſſe departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God night and day:</hi> Not that ſhe was there without any intermiſſion, but the greateſt part of night and day, or at the uſuall time both of night and day: <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies before the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that by the ſpace of three yeares, <hi>he ceaſed not to warne every one, night and day with his teares,</hi> Act. 20.31. Did he therefore actually preach three yeares, night and day without intermiſſion? That had been a long Sermon indeed. Then his meaning is but this, that in thoſe three yeares, he watched and made uſe of all poſſible oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, both by night and by day to preach the Goſpell: So we may underſtand it here, <hi>they ſate downe, ſeven dayes and ſeven nights,</hi> that is, a great part of ſeven dayes and ſeven nights, or all the time of thoſe ſeven dayes and ſeven nights, which were fitting for ſuch a viſit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Origen</hi> will have it, ſeven nights and ſeven dayes, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; In maintenance of which aſſertion, he ſaith, they were preſerved by miracle, without ſleep, and without meate, all that time. But here is plaine truth, without a miracld.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas it is ſaid, ſeven dayes and ſeven nights; we may note further, that the number ſeven, (as other numbers) may be underſtood indefinitely, a certaine time being put for an uncertaine; as <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.9. The Prophet ſaith, <hi>She that hath borne ſeven</hi> (that is, many children) <hi>languiſheth:</hi> And <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Give a portion to ſeven,</hi> that is, to many. Thus we may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it here, <hi>they ſate downe, ſeven dayes and ſeven nights,</hi> that is, many dayes and many nights; as it is expre'ſt of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> chap. 1.4. That when he heard of the calamity of <hi>Jeruſalem, he mourned many dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We may take it ſtrictly, for ſeven preciſe dayes and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:98733:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nights, and then it referres to the ceremony of mourning for the dead; it was a cuſtome to mourne ſeven dayes for the dead; <hi>Jobs</hi> friends looked upon him as a dead man, and ſo they mourned for him according to the manner of mourning for the dead. <hi>Joſeph</hi> made a mourning for his father <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſeven dayes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.10. We have the like time of mourning mentioned, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.13. The time of mourning varied both in times and places. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> mourned for <hi>Jacob</hi> threeſcore and ten dayes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.3. The <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> mourned for <hi>Moſes</hi> thirty dayes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.8. which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of mourning thirty dayes for the dead, continued long after among the <hi>Jewes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioſephus. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>de bello lud.</hi> c. 15.</note> For <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports, that when the <hi>Jewes</hi> thought he had been killed, they mourned thirty dayes for him. So that we may take it here, preciſely for ſeven dayes and ſeven nights, and referre it to the cuſtome of mourning for the dead, or in caſes of extreame ſorrow among that people. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And none ſpake a word unto him.</hi> This is the fourth ceremony of their mourning, their ſilence. In great mournings, ſilence makes up the ſolemnity. So <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.10. Theſe are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>The Elders of the daughters of</hi> Zion <hi>ſit upon the ground,</hi> there is the former ceremony, <hi>and keepe ſilence.</hi> Now whereas it is ſaid, they kept ſilence; we need not underſtand it ſo ſtrictly, as if for ſeven dayes and ſeven nights, they never ſpake a word. It is uſuall likewiſe in all languages, and very frequent in Scripture, that what is but ſeldome done, or done but a little, is ſaid not to be done at all, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 27.33. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of thoſe that were in the Ship, <hi>that for fourteene dayes they had faſted, having taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> a thing beyond the ſtrength of man, take it ſtrictly, to faſt foureteene dayes, taking nothing. But, it is uſuall to ſay, that is not done at all, which is but a little done; <hi>They tooke nothing to eate,</hi> that is, they tooke very ſparingly, they did eate only ſo much as would, according to our language, keepe life and ſoule together. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 20.3. it is ſaid, that <hi>Iſaiah walked naked and barefoote for three yeares:</hi> Now it cannot be conceived, that the Prophet walked, as we ſay ſtarke naked, for three yeares together; He is ſaid to walke naked, becauſe he had not ſuch or ſo much cloathing as formerly and uſually he had worne. So here, they ſpake not a word to him, that is, they did not ſpeake much, they ſpake very little to him; Or ſecondly thus, Reſtrictively to the matter, they ſpake not a word, by way of diſpute or argument (which was
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:98733:165"/>
the buſineſſe they fell upon afterward) either to convince him or reprove him.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this fourth ceremoniall act of mourning, their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, is added in the laſt words of the Chapter, <hi>For they ſaw that his griefe was very great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word here uſed for <hi>griefe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> though it had bin alone without any epithite to heighten the ſenſe, notes a very intenſive, a deepe and great ſorrow. And it is put ſometimes, for griefe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ariſing from the paine of the body, and ſometimes, for griefe and ſorrow of mind; Now here I conceive it may carry both ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; they ſaw that the griefe and paine of his body was very great, his body was in a wofull plight; and they ſaw, that his ſpirit was much perplext too, his mind was troubled. But if this word alone ſignifies as it were all degrees, and all kinds of ſorrow, then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both the variety of kind, and intention of degrees collected in <hi>Jobs</hi> ſorrows, which a word ſo comprehenſive is not ſufficient to expreſſe; the aid of two other words is called in to helpe out our conception of his ſorrowes. <hi>They ſaw his griefe,</hi> they ſaw <hi>his griefe was great,</hi> yet you have not all, <hi>They ſaw his griefe was very great,</hi> exceeding great; this aggravates his griefe,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> and winds up his ſorrow to the higheſt; as if now the affliction were growne to a full ſtature: God threatens <hi>Babylon,</hi> Iſa. 47.9. <hi>Theſe two things ſhall come upon thee, in a moment, in one day; the loſſe of children and widdow-hood, theſe things ſhall come upon thee in their perfection.</hi> Sometimes imperfect judgements are upon a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or a perſon; they are as it were infant judgements, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beginning; anon they grow to a greater height, and anon they come to a perfect ſtature, to be mighty ones, giantly judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: at that time God had even brought <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and his griefe was proportionable, very great: For this reaſon his friends kept ſilence; this reaſon hath an influence on all the acts of their ſorrow, but eſpecially upon this, their keeping ſilence, <hi>For they ſaw his griefe was very great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe ceremoniall acts of ſorrow, I have obſerved divers things heretofore: Now take one thing in generall<hi>,That great ſufferings call us to, and warrant us in ſolemne mournings. Iobs</hi> friends doe not only mourne, but they mourne as it were in ſtate; there is a kind of magnificence in mourning, a pomp in mourning; I approve not a proud pomp, but an humble pomp; they mourne you ſee with all the formalities of <hi>mourning:</hi> ſo it
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:98733:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
becometh us ſometimes; as great mercies call for great rejoycings, ſo great afflictions call for great lamentings. There is a decency in it, when our affections keepe pace with the diſpenſations of God, whether they be mercies or judgements, comforts or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Foraſmuch as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends ſeeing his ſorrow to be thus <hi>very great,</hi> kept ſilence; Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in great, in over-whelming ſorrows, the mind is unfit to receive and take in comfort.</hi> When griefe is very great, words give little eaſe, pretious words are waſted and throwne away, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort it ſelfe is a trouble, in the greatneſſe and height of trouble. I am ſure a mind full charg'd with ſorrow, hath no roome for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, is not at leiſure for counſell. It is a profitable rule in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting friends that are ſick, or in diſtreſſe; when you ſee them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of paine of body, or in extremity of anguiſh and trouble of ſpirit, keepe ſilence, waite a while. Let the waters aſſwage a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the winds fall before you meddle. Let them come to themſelves before you move them.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Etiam tacitur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas ipſa me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicina eſt,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ. <hi>in</hi> Pſa. 37.</note> As ſodaine anger, ſo ſodaine ſorrow is a kind of phrenſy: <hi>No wiſe Phyſitian will give a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in a fit:</hi> The body muſt ſettle before it is fit for phyſick, and ſo muſt the mind too; ſilence is as good as phyſick in ſome diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers both of mind and body. A talkative comforter, is another diſeaſe to a ſick man;<note place="margin">

                  </note> unſeaſonable councell is a wound inſtead of a plaiſter, and inſtead of healing, tortures the patient. It is as high a point of prudence to know when, as to know what to adviſe a diſtreſſed friend. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us in generall (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.7.) <hi>There is a time to keepe ſilence, and a time to ſpeake</hi>; Let me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe this for one particular time or ſeaſon, to keepe ſilence, namely the extremity and height of trouble. The Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> c. 5.13. ſpeakes of a time, wherein the prudent ſhall be ſilent, and he ſhewes us why, <hi>in that time the prudent ſhall keepe ſilence, for it is an evill time.</hi> Some interpret this, as an addition to the common calamity of thoſe times: They ſhould be ſo evill, that wiſe-men would hold their peace. The Apoſtle prophecies of ſuch times, wherein men <hi>will not endure ſound doctrine,</hi> (2 Tim. 4, 3.) <hi>in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> And ſuch times may be, wherein men will not endure ſound doctrine, in policy. Then the prudent hold their peace, and none ſpeake but fooles or flatterers, ſuch times make the quickeſt market for their ſophiſticated wares, no other will goe off: Such are very evill times, and this is a ſore judgement upon thoſe times. There is
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:98733:166"/>
hope of good when wiſe men ſpeake: A word from their mouthes may cure and deliver a nation. Yet I conceive that this Text of <hi>Amos</hi> may be underſtood as a deſcription of a wiſe mans duty, at leaſt of his property, in ſome high and great diſtempers upon a people. He ſees them uncapeable of counſell, to give them good advice, is (at that preſent) but the caſting of pearles before ſwine, all is loſt and undervalued, if not trampled on: Yea he ſees, that the more he labours to reforme, the more he enrages them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till this fit be over, prudence teacheth him to keepe ſilence.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo it is with private perſons in regard of the evills they endure, they cannot endure faithfull counſell in ſuch an evill day upon any private perſon, let the prudent keepe ſilence, and waite for an opportunity, which may open a paſſage to let in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes, or directions, or conſolations, with a taking advantage into the hearts of their afflicted friends and bretheren. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſeeing the troubles approaching <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> reſolves to take his fill of mourning, <hi>Therefore ſaid I, looke away from me, I will weepe bitterly, labour not to comfort me,</hi> chap. 22.4. He ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought that the beholders would faint to ſee him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith, <hi>looke away from me</hi>; or that ſeeing him, they would ſay, he fainted, and ſo would be giving him comfort; that therefore his ſorrow might have full ſcope: He ſaith, <hi>Looke away from me, I will weepe bitterly, labour not to comfort me.</hi> When a man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to mourne, let him mourne, your adviſe may anger him, but it will not help him: Let ſorrow have its way a while, and that will make way for comfort.</p>
               <p>We have thus farre carried on the ſad ſtory of <hi>Jobs</hi> viſitation, his griefe is now come to the height, <hi>It is very great.</hi> We have alſo ſeene his friends viſit, with a double intendment, <hi>both to mourne with him, and to comfort him.</hi> We have ſeene them mourning, they fully reacht that end. We leave them now ſilent, waiting for a time to attempt and accompliſh the other end: they miſerably fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in that, it was to comfort him, <hi>but they proved miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters:</hi> Which in the progreſſe and proceſſe of this Booke, will receive a large and full diſcovery.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE former Chapter concluded with the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſilence of <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends: This Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beginneth with an aſtoniſhing ſpeech of <hi>Job.</hi> We may be as much amazed at what <hi>Job</hi> ſpake, as we were at their ſilence; And there appeares the ſame reaſon of both: namely, <hi>the greatneſſe of his griefe.</hi> They ſaw his griefe ſo great, that they forbare to ſpeake; <hi>Job</hi> feeleth his griefe ſo great, that he cannot longer forbeare to ſpeake; it muſt have a vent, <hi>After this</hi> (ſaith the Text) Job <hi>opened his mouth.</hi> Why, <hi>Job</hi> had opened his mouth before, he had ſpoken twice ſince he was encompaſſed with thoſe ſorrowes. True; But <hi>Job</hi> never opened his mouth as now; he opened his mouth before, to juſtifie and to bleſſe his God, now he openeth his mouth to accuſe, and <hi>curſe his day,</hi> and therefore the Chapter may well begin with, <hi>After this</hi> Job <hi>opened his mouth,</hi> he never ſpake in this manner before: For he no ſooner opened his mouth, but he <hi>curſed his day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The argument and ſubject of the whole Chapter, is contained in this firſt verſe, <hi>the curſing of his day</hi>; and concerning this, the Chapter holdeth forth three things moſt conſiderable. There are three particulars belonging unto this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Matter and the Manner of this Curſe; what it is, and how expre'ſt: <hi>Job</hi> pronounceth a curſe upon his day, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds the curſe; he unfolds it with much Rhetorick and ſtraines of eloquence: Troubles will make a man Rhetoricall. <hi>Job</hi> (as it were) calls up all his ſpirits, whets his wit, and heightens his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:98733:167"/>
to prepare a proper curſe for his day. This he doth from this firſt verſe to the end of the nineteenth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In this Chapter <hi>Job</hi> holds forth to us, the ground or reaſon of this curſe: He is full of paſſion, but <hi>his paſſion is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall.</hi> He curſeth, but he ſhewes you why. This reaſon (with ſome occaſionall intermixtures) is demonſtrated from the ninth to the end of the nineteenth verſe. If I am asked a reaſon of my anger, why I am ſo bitter againſt my day, This is the account I give, <hi>Becauſe it ſhut not up my mothers wombe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We have an inforcement of this curſe upon his day, by a vehement expoſtulation, againſt the lengthning and continuance of his dayes. He complained in the beginning of the Chapter, that ever he had a day, and now he complaines as much that he hath any more dayes. He wonders why his life began, and he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled becauſe it doth not end. <hi>Wherefore is light given to him that is in miſery?</hi> &amp;c. This expoſtulation concludes the Chapter.</p>
               <p>The nine former verſes containe the firſt diviſion of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Jobs</hi> curſe upon his day, both the matter and the manner of the Curſe.</p>
               <p>We have this Curſe, firſt pronounced upon his day in generall, <hi>Then</hi> Job <hi>opened his mouth, and curſed his day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He fixes a curſe upon his day, in the ſeverall parts of it. Take a naturall day, for the ſpace of 24 houres, and then it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of two parts, of day and night, light and darkeneſſe. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which diviſion the curſe runs, verſe 3. <hi>Let the day pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh wherein I was borne, and the night wherein it was ſaid, a man child is conceived.</hi>

Sorrow doth ſometimes not only oppreſſe the ſpirit, but ſtop the mouth, <hi>I am ſo troubled that I cannot ſpeake,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 77.4.

               <p>A man cannot ſpeake till he open his mouth, yet to open the mouth and ſpeake, is more then to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To open the mouth and ſpeake, is to ſpeake with a loud or cleare voice; as he that ſpeakes ſoftly, is ſaid to ſpeake in his throat.

               <p>In the third place, <hi>To open the mouth and ſpeake,</hi> is to ſpeake upon mature deliberation, to ſpeake conſiderately, prudently, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, to ſpeake elegantly, to ſpeake orderly, <hi>to ſpeake the words of truth and ſoberneſſe.</hi> A foole is ſaid to ſpeake with an open mouth: but a wiſe man openeth his mouth and ſpeakes. A wiſe godly man hath his tongue at his command, but a fooles tongue commands him: His tongue runs faſter then his wit, as we ſay. <hi>A fooles mouth</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.2.) <hi>powreth out foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe:</hi> Their mouthes are alwayes open; and therefore they

The Hebrew word ſignifies to rule or have authority: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch ſpeeches come upon us with authority, and ſubdue our reaſon by the weight of theirs. Now when he is about to ſpeake Parables, he ſaith, <hi>I will open my mouth.</hi> When wiſedome calls for audience and obedience, <hi>Prov:</hi> 8.6. ſhe ſaith, <hi>Heare, for I will ſpeake of excellent things, and the opening of my lips ſhall be right things. David</hi> invokes God to open his mouth, when he would ſhew forth that excellent thing, the <hi>praiſe of God,</hi> Pſal. 51.15. God opens not the mouth of a foole, neither doth a foole open his mouth and ſpeake, but his ſpeech opens his mouth.</p>
               <p>But did <hi>Job</hi> open his mouth in this ſenſe wiſely and diſcreetly? did he well to be ſo angry with his day? ſpake he wiſely in curſing his day?

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>To open the mouth and ſpeake,</hi> is to ſpeake boldly and confidently, to ſpeake with freedome and liberty of ſpeech; (as the Greeke word ſignifies) to ſpeake all a mans mind,<note place="margin">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rivetus.</note> a word is uſed which hath neither name nor ſhadow of a bleſſing: And it is derived from a roote which ſignifieth, a thing that is light, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable or unſetled. And ſo by a Metaphor, it ſignifies any thing or perſon which we diſpiſe, contemne and ſlight, or the act of deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and curſing; and the reaſon of it is, becauſe thoſe things which we deſpiſe, contemne or curſe, we looke upon as light things, triviall, or vaine, or hurtfull: On the contrary, the word in the Hebrew for honour and glory, comes from a roote which ſignifieth heavy or ponderous; becauſe that which we honour and reſpect, we looke upon it as a thing that hath weight and ſubſtance in it: And the Apoſtle calls that moſt glorious eſtate of the Saints in Heaven, <hi>a weight of glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. The oppoſite word which we have in the Text, is frequently tranſlated, to deſpiſe or contemne, and likewiſe to curſe and blaſpheme: and doth properly ſignifie ſuch a curſing, as ariſes from the contempt, or light eſteeme, which we have of a thing or perſon. So we have the word clearely uſed, Levit. 20.9, <hi>Every one that curſeth his father or his mother</hi>; Now obſerve, curſing of the father or mother, it is directly oppoſed to the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Commandement, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy mother,</hi> thou ſhalt looke upon thy father and thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as upon perſons of weight and honour, whom thou art bound to reverence and eſteeme; ſo that to curſe the father or mother, is to account them vile and contemptible. The ſame word expreſſes,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:98733:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that villanous act of <hi>Shimei,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.15. <hi>who came forth, and curſed</hi> David <hi>ſtill as he came.</hi> That act was alike oppoſite both to the rule and word of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Commandement, which ſaith, <hi>honour thy father,</hi> &amp;c. taking-in the civill father as well as the naturall: <hi>Shimeis</hi> curſing <hi>David,</hi> lightly eſteemed <hi>David,</hi> he did not looke upon him, in or according to the weightineſſe and honour of his Kingly perſon, or of his Kingly office, <hi>a King is a weighty perſon, a Crowne is a weighty thing, Shimei</hi> deſpiſed and ſo curſed both. Sometime the word is tranſlated directly to deſpiſe: I will give you two texts for that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.4. <hi>When</hi> Hagar <hi>ſaw ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, her Miſtreſſe was deſpiſed in her eyes,</hi> (it is the ſame word with that uſed here for curſing,) the meaning is, ſhe did lightly eſteeme her Miſtreſſe; Thus ſhe thought, now ſhall I have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of raiſing <hi>Abrahams</hi> family; now I am at leaſt as good a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as my miſtreſſe, thus ſhe deſpiſed <hi>Sarah.</hi> Againe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. where the Lord ſaith concerning <hi>Elies</hi> ſonnes, <hi>Them that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me I will honour, and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> I will make little account of them that make little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of me, and woe be to thoſe (though all the world honour them) whom God deſpiſeth: That man looſes more then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whom God doth not honour: And they who deny God his honour, deny him all good, and offer him all evill; ſuch a diſpiſing of God, is a curſing of God.</p>
               <p>Further, To curſe (if we conſider it in the nature of the thing, and not ſtrictly in the literall ſenſe of the word) is to wiſh evill to a thing or perſon; This alſo is the meaning of the curſe in this place; for when <hi>Iob</hi> explaines this curſe in the parts of it, he doth (as it were) with wonderfull art and skill, gather together what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may be thought the evill of a day, or the evill of a night, and calls it up, to ſeize upon them. A curſe, or to curſe, virtually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in it all evill; As a bleſſing, or to bleſſe, containes in it vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually all good. Every mercy we enjoy, is a bleſſing ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; And ſo any evill that falls upon man, (as Sword, Famine, Peſtilence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is a curſe ſpecificated; Howſoever poſſibly thoſe things which are in their nature evill, and in their matter a curſe, may be qualified (in reference unto ſome perſons) into a bleſſing. But take a curſe properly, and it containeth all evill, and only evill in it. Therefore as when God had given the world an <hi>eſſe,</hi> a being, that he might give it, a <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> a well being, he adds to the work of Creation, the word of benediction, <hi>And God bleſſed them, and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:98733:170"/>
ſaid unto them, be fruitfull,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.22, 28. So afterward when man had ſinned, and the Lord intended to leave the world groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under part of thoſe evills which ſin had brought upon it, he wraps up all in the word of a curſe, <hi>Curſed be the ground for thy ſake,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. So then when <hi>Job</hi> curſeth his day, he wiſheth all the evill to it, that a day is capable of. <hi>And</hi> Job <hi>opened his mouth and curſed his day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, what was this day that <hi>Job</hi> was ſo angry with it? and that his paſſion doth ſo burne againſt it?</p>
               <p>The Text ſpeakes indefinitely, Job <hi>curſed his day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some underſtand it of the day of his preſent ſuffering, he curſed the day on which ſuch troubles befell him: And we find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Scripture, that a day put thus alone, is an evill or a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome day; As in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> of the Prophecie of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> the Lord rebukes the children of <hi>Edom</hi> thus, <hi>Thou ſhouldeſt not have looked on the day of thy brother,</hi> that is, the day of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſufferings, the day wherein I had him under my rod and afflicted him. So the day of the Lord, is the day of the Lords anger, when he powres wrath and trouble upon the earth. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.12. <hi>The day of the Lord of hoſtes ſhall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he ſhall be brought low.</hi> The day of the Lord, or the day of a man unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, often ſignifies an evill day.</p>
               <p>But here we may rather underſtand it for that day which was as the occaſion, or for the occaſionall day of all <hi>Jobs</hi> troubles, and that was his birth-day; If his birth-day had beene prevented, all his troubleſome dayes had beene prevented, therefore he falls out with that, as himſelfe explaines it, verſe 3. <hi>Let the day periſh</hi> (ſaith he there) <hi>wherein I was borne, and the night in which it was ſaid, there is a man-child conceived.</hi> It is uſuall to call a mans birth-day <hi>his day,</hi> ſo the Scripture is conceived to ſpeake, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.5. <hi>In the day of our King, the Princes have made him ſicke with bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of wine</hi>; That is, on his birth-day, which among Princes is commonly ſolemniz'd with feaſting: As we reade of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and of <hi>Herod.</hi> So then, the day is his birth-day, the day of his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: which ſome take preciſely, for the day upon which he was borne; and others more largely, for the annuall returne of that day; as if he had laid in a curſe for a day, whenſoever or how often ſoever it ſhould returne in the yeares of his life.</p>
               <p>A little further to cleare the ſenſe of this curſe, let us conſider the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:98733:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whole matter as we have conſidered the words. There are two or three queſtions, which being debated and reſolved, will give light to this context.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> you ſee takes upon him to curſe, Firſt, it may be queſtioned whether a curſe be in the power of man or no? Can a man curſe perſons or things?</p>
               <p>Surely bleſſings and curſings are both in the hand of God; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we reſpect perſons or things. There is a miniſteriall curſe, and a miniſteriall bleſſing in the power of man: but it is not in the power of any man, magiſterially to make any thing or perſon bleſſed, or to make any thing or perſon accurſed. It was a great brag which <hi>Balack</hi> made of <hi>Balaam,</hi> (Numb. 22.6) <hi>I wot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that he whom thou bleſſest is bleſſed, and he whom thou curſeſt is curſed.</hi> He thought he had the curſe in his command, he could curſe whom he pleaſed, and what he pleaſed, and when he pleaſed, but he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; he reckon'd beyond his ſtrength, and beyond the ſtrength of a creature. What the Apoſtle ſpeakes in another caſe concerning the miniſtery of the word, Paul <hi>may plant, and</hi> Apollos <hi>may wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but it is God that giveth the increaſe,</hi> is as true in this; one man may plant a curſe, and another man may water it with a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wiſh that it may grow, but it is God only that giveth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of evill,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prima ſemper irarum tela ſunt maledicta, &amp; que non poſſumus imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilles, optamus irati. Votis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis pro armis utimur.</hi> Salvian l. 3 <hi>de gubern.</hi>
                  </note> and the decreaſe of good. Curſes are not in the power of any creature, if they were, we ſhould have a miſerable world quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. How many ſhould we ſee daily blaſted with the breath of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious execrations? <hi>Some mens mouthes are full of curſing,</hi> Pſal. 10.7. <hi>They love curſing, they cloath themſelves with curſing as with a garment,</hi> Pſal. 109.17, 18. Curſing (as one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients complained in his time) is now made the common weapon of anger, and wrath wiſhes that evill, which (becauſe of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) it cannot worke. If curſing could have done it, we had not been a people at this day. How often hath <hi>Balack</hi> (out of feare or envy at our proſperity) ſent to <hi>Balaam</hi> (I meane the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that dwels on the ſeven hils) come curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> come de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>England</hi>; how often hath that <hi>Balaam</hi> curs'd our <hi>Iſrael?</hi> We have heard of his Anniverſary Anathemaes, wherein this Church and ſtate have been ſtruck with the thunder and lightning of his Papal curſe. But the curſe cauſeleſſe (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) ſhall not come. And we may ſay to <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did to <hi>Iſrael</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Balaams</hi> curſe, Deut. 23.5. <hi>Nevertheleſſe the Lord thy God would not hearken unto</hi> Balaam: <hi>But the Lord thy God tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:98733:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the curſe into a bleſſing unto thee, becauſe the Lord thy God loved thee.</hi> And what <hi>David</hi> prai'd about <hi>Shimei's</hi> curſe, we have ſeene come to paſſe: <hi>The Lord hath requited us good for his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.12. We have far greater cauſe to feare the bleſſing of <hi>Rome,</hi> then the curſe of <hi>Rome:</hi> But to returne. The reſult of all is this; <hi>When God pronounceth a curſe, he makes it to be a curſe; man at the worſt, can but wiſh a curſe and pronounce it.</hi> Man is but the miniſter, God is the Maſter of the curſe, God can inflict it, man can but think or wiſh it.</p>
               <p>Another thing here queſtionable is, Whether it be lawfull to curſe the creature? <hi>Job</hi> curſeth his day; The rule of the Apoſtle is, Rom. 12.4. <hi>Bleſſe and curſe not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſome caſes, to curſe is Gods command and our duty, and then we are Gods miniſters for wrath againſt the wicked. Many times man (though forbidden) curſes, then it is his ſin, and he is Satans miniſter for evill againſt his brother.</p>
               <p>There are ſome caſes wherein we may curſe. When the Patriark <hi>Jacob</hi> was upon his death bed, and bed of bleſſing, he yet pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a curſe upon the rage and anger of his two ſonnes <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> Gen. 49.7. <hi>Curſed be their anger for it was fierce, and their wrath for it was cruell. I will divide them in</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ſcatter them in</hi> Iſrael. We may curſe the plots and counſels of wicked men, enemies of Chriſt and of his people: we may curſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of wicked men, as implacable enemies of Chriſt, and of his people; So <hi>David</hi> more then once in the Booke of <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> yet it is to be conſidered, that ſome of thoſe <hi>Pſalmes</hi> are Prophecies of a curſe, not pronunciations of a curſe. And in all lawfull curſings we muſt obſerve theſe two rules. Firſt, To aime the curſe at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſin, not of the ſinner. Secondly, Where the ſinner appeares incorrigible, yet to deſire the clearing up of Gods Juſtice in puniſhing, not the puniſhment it ſelfe. To curſe any thing or perſon paſſionately, is infirmity: To curſe any thing or perſon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly, is groſſe impiety.</p>
               <p>There is a third doubt, the reſolving of which will further cleare the Scripture to us, that is, Whether a day, be an object capable of a curſe or no? It is a queſtion moved by the Schoole-men,<note place="margin">Aquin. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> Therefore a day
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:98733:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is a part of time, is in it ſelfe incapable of a curſe; Thoſe things only are capable of penall evils which are capable of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall evils; A day is not, cannot be morally evill, though there be many morall evils acted in the day. The Apoſtle adviſeth us, <hi>to redeeme the time, becauſe the dayes are evill,</hi> Epheſ. 5.15. Times are called evill, in regard both of troubleſome evils and ſinfull evils; From evill men and evill manners, dayes are denominated evill, yet dayes in themſelves are not evill morally, and ſo not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a curſe, which is a penall evill.</p>
               <p>Further, Thoſe creatures which have life in them, and have no reaſon in them, are on the ſame ground incapable of a curſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid, that God curſed the ground, and curſed the ſerpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.14, 17. neither the ground nor the ſerpent were curſed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or for their own ſakes. The ſerpent an unreaſonable creature, had not the knowledge of God, and the earth a ſenſleſſe creature could not feele the power of God; therefore the curſe upon thoſe creatures, was only in order to, and as a puniſhment of the ſin of man; The Text is expreſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Curſed be the earth for thy ſake</hi>; The earth there comprehends all the creatures living on the face of the earth, beſides man: Theſe are curſed for mans ſake, As thoſe creatures at the firſt received not a being or a bleſſing for themſelves, but for mans good, ſo they receive not any evill or curſe but for mans puniſhment: So we are to underſtand thoſe places in Deut. 28. <hi>Curſed be thy basket and thy ſtore,</hi> &amp;c. God threatens a curſe on theſe creatures, the fruits of the earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in order to mans diſobedience: <hi>But it ſhall come to paſſe, if thou wilt not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to obſerve to doe all his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that all theſe curſes ſhall came upon thee, and overtake thee, ver.</hi> 15. Obſerve, <hi>That the curſe is threatned to come on them, to overtake them</hi>; When the basket was curs'd, when the increaſe of the kine and the flocks of the ſheepe were curſed, man was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: For we may ſay in the letter, as <hi>David</hi> did in a figure, when the Angell of the Lord ſmote his people with the peſtilence, (2 Sam. 24.) <hi>Alas what have theſe ſheepe done?</hi> that they ſhould be ſmitten with a curſe. As in pulling downe the houſe of a Traitor, the revenge is not taken againſt the materials of the houſe, but againſt the Maſter of the houſe. So then for the reſolution of this point, take it thus, <hi>No creature below man, is or can be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by God or man properly, terminately, or ultimately:</hi> That is, in it ſelfe or for it ſelfe, or from it ſelfe, but only improperly
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:98733:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and relatively, namely with reſpect to what man ſhould doe, hath done, or ſuffered. Firſt, in reference to what man ſhould doe; ſo Chriſt curſed the fig-tree, to teach man either the duty of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to the glory of God, or of faith in the power of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in reference to what man hath done, the ſin of man, thus God curſed the ſerpent and the ground: The ſerpent was curſed both for admonition to man, and for a puniſhment on man; God to admoniſh man, how much he hated ſin, puniſhes an irrationall inſtrument of ſin, and by that enmity planted in the ſerpent as a curſe, puniſhes mans too much familiarity with the ſerpent. And as the enmity of the ſerpent was mans ſcourge, ſo alſo was the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe of the earth: That barrenneſſe in bringing forth good fruit, that fertility in bringing forth bryars and thornes, were both as rods for the back of man. Thirdly, the irrationall or ſenceleſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are curſed in reference to that, which man ſuffers. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> curſed the mountaines of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> 2 Sam. 1.21. becauſe there <hi>Saul</hi> and his beloved <hi>Jonathan</hi> were ſlaine by the ſword of the Philiſtines, <hi>becauſe there the ſhield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the ſword of</hi> Saul, <hi>as if he had not been anointed with oyle.</hi> In this ſenſe, (as <hi>David</hi> curſed a place,) ſo <hi>Job</hi> curſes a time, <hi>his day,</hi> the day which either gave occa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus alſo <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi> curſes his day with a vehement curſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.14. <hi>Curſed be the day wherein I was borne, let not the day wherein my mother bare me be bleſſed:</hi> And not only ſo, but he curſes the man who firſt reported his birth, verſe 15, 16. <hi>Curſed be the man who brought tidings to my father, ſaying, a man-child is borne unto thee, making him very glad.

               <p>We ſhewed you before, that his day in generall was the object of this curſe, now he curſes it in the parts of it, the day and the night. <hi>Let the day periſh,</hi> &amp;c. At which words the ſtile alters, that which you reade forward to the ſixt verſe of the 42 Chapter, is ſacred Poetry, <hi>Job</hi> breathes out his paſſion in verſe, and in verſe receives his anſwer. It is queſtioned, whether <hi>Job</hi> at that time opened his mouth, and vented his ſorrowes in verſe, or whether it were after contrived ſo by the pen-man of this booke. As I ſee no profit in moving this queſtion, ſo I think there is no poſſibility of reſolving it: And therefore I leave it as I found it, a quere ſtill. Only this is obſerveable; that writing in verſe is moſt ſutable, where the matter written is deepely ſteep't in, and chiefely wrought out of our affections. Hence we find, That thoſe parts of Scripture which ſet forth ſtrongeſt affections, are compoſed in verſe: As thoſe holy flames of ſpirituall love betweene Chriſt and his Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> of <hi>Solomon:</hi> The triumphant joy of <hi>Deborah,</hi> after deliverance from <hi>Siſera's</hi> Army: Of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> after the deſtruction of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>: The afflicting ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his ſickneſſe: And the <hi>Lamentations</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,</hi> for the captivity of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> The booke of <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> is as it were a throng of all affections, Love, joy, ſorrow, feare, hope, anger, zeale, every paſſion acting a part, and wound up in higheſt ſtraines by the Spirit of God, breathing Poeticall eloquence into that heavenly Prophet. So this Booke of <hi>Job,</hi> whoſe ſubject is ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, hath a compoſure anſwerable to the matter. Paſſion hath moſt ſcope in verſe, and is freeſt when tyed up in numbers. The words follow;
<q>Let the day periſh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What this day was, we ſhewed you before; It was the day of his nativity, <hi>the day</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wherein I was borne.</hi> How ſhould this day periſh?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:98733:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>To <hi>periſh,</hi> ſignifies firſt, not to be. A thing is ſaid to periſh, when it is annihilated, when it returnes to nothing: As the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſpeakes, <hi>Man being in honour and underſtandeth not, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the beasts that periſh.</hi> The periſhing of a beaſt, is the non-entity of a beaſt, when a beaſt dieth, it periſheth, it is not; A beaſt is no more, but vaniſheth quite, and is gone for ever. Then, ſuch mens likeneſſe to a beaſt, is not in periſhing, but in the want of true underſtanding: He doth not ſay, man periſheth like a beaſt, but he is like a beaſt, that periſheth. A wicked man how honourable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is <hi>a bruitiſh man,</hi> ver. 10. For he knowes nothing ſpiritually, and <hi>what he knowes naturally, in that like a bruit beaſt he corrupts himſelfe,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. of his Epiſtle. But betweene the periſhing of a fooliſh man and a beaſt, there is a vaſt difference; A beaſts periſhing is a not-being, A fooliſh mans peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing is a miſerable being.</p>
               <p>For ſecondly, To <hi>periſh,</hi> ſignifies often a miſerable being, as in Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n, that whoſoever beleeveth, ſhould not periſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Not periſh,</hi> the meaning of it is not, that all unbeleevers ſhall looſe their very beings, become a nothing, and with their exiſtence part from their eſſence. Some wicked beaſtly men would be glad of this, that they might live here wickedly, and afterward die like beaſts, in that ſenſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: If this were the periſhing that is threatned unbeleevers, many of them would be ready to ſay out of love and liking to their luſts, as <hi>Esther</hi> did out of love and zeale to the cauſe of God, <hi>If we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh we periſh,</hi> If this be to periſh, let us periſh. But that periſhing is of another nature; <hi>They that beleeve not ſhall periſh,</hi> that is, they ſhall live and periſh, they ſhall be, and be miſerable for ever, the wrath of a diſpleaſed God, and the ſting of a polluted conſcience, ſhall torment them to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To <hi>periſh,</hi> is to be empaired or looſe former dignity and reſpect. So <hi>let the day periſh,</hi> may be taken in this ſenſe, let not that day be ſolemnized, let it not be remembred with wonted joy and gladneſſe. A day which hath uſually bin ſolemnized, may be ſaid to periſh, when that ſolemnity is layed downe, and utterly diſus'd. In ancient times (and the cuſtome in ſome places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines to this day) Great men and Princes kept the memory of their birth-dayes with feaſting and triumph. Thus we reade, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.20. <hi>And it came to paſſe the third day, which was</hi> Pharaohs <hi>birth-day, that he made a feaſt unto all his ſervants,</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:98733:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
14.6. we reade, <hi>that when</hi> Herods <hi>birth-day was kept, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of</hi> Herodias <hi>danced before them.</hi> It is generally conceived, that <hi>Job</hi> did ſolemnize his birth-day; and ſo many interpreters take thoſe feaſts ſpoken of in the firſt Chapter, to have been, the birth-day feaſts of <hi>Jobs</hi> Children. <hi>Origen</hi> in his fragments upon <hi>Matthew,</hi> affirmes, that the Scripture gives no teſtimony of any one good man celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his birth-day: The truth is, while we reflect upon our birth-ſin, we have little cauſe to rejoyce in our birth-day: The new-borne infant ſeemes to forbid this ſolemnity, and by his teares weepes and ſpeakes downe this joy. The birth-day of nature ſhould be mourned over every day, much more upon the day of our birth. The birth-day of Grace is our joy and our glory, and is worthy to be rejoyced in, not only in this day of grace, but in that of glory, and ſo it ſhall. <hi>Eternity which is the day of glory, is one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued triumph for our birth-day in grace.</hi> Notwithſtanding this, I ſee no cogent reaſon, why a godly man may not celebrate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his naturall birth-day; ſo he rejoyce in God, who tooke him out of his mothers wombe, and hath preſerved him ever ſince he was borne. So then, we taking <hi>Jobs</hi> day for his birth-day, he ſaying, <hi>let that day periſh,</hi> meanes, let it be no more ſolemnized, let there be no more joy, no feaſts upon that day.</p>
               <p>Or fourthly, <hi>Let that day periſh,</hi> may be thus underſtood, let not that be reckoned upon, let it be loſt, let it not be counted in the Calender of the yeare. A day whereof no uſe is made, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture, a loſt day, a fallen or periſhed day. In the ſixt of <hi>Numbers,</hi> the number of dayes is preſcribed for the ſeparation of the Nazarites, thus and thus it ſhall be, and ſo many dayes: Now, if the Nazarite had cantinued many dayes, according to the Law of his ſeparation, yet if he were polluted with a dead body before the full number was accompliſht, then he muſt begin againe, for (ſaith <hi>Moſes,) the dayes that were before ſhall be loſt, becauſe his ſeparation was defiled,</hi> ver. 12. In the Hebrew it is, <hi>all the other dayes ſhall fall,</hi> he muſt not reckon upon thoſe: So here <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>let the day periſh,</hi> that is, let it not be numbred or reckon'd, let it be as a day loſt or fallen: So then the ſumme of all is this; let the joy and ſolemnity of my birth-day be laid aſide, let it never be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated more in the returne of the yeare. I could wiſh that day had never beene, but ſeeing that is impoſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it having been already, yet let it be as if it had never been, let it be put out of all accounts, let it be taken off from all records; and not only not remembred
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:98733:174"/>
with mirth and feaſting, but not be remembred at all.</p>
               <q>And the night wherein it was ſaid, a man child is conceived.</q>
               <p>So we tranſlate: The elegancy of the Hebrew ſpeakes thus, <hi>The night which ſaid, a man-child is conceived</hi>; as if the night had been the meſſenger, and had brought word of his conception.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Some ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hebrew word [<hi>Hara,</hi>] (which we tranſlate conceived) <hi>Borne,</hi> applying both parts of the verſe to his birth, <hi>Let the day pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh wherein I was borne, and the night in which it was ſaid a man-child is brought forth</hi>; And the Originall word will beare it, being uſed (as learned <hi>Mercer</hi> obſerves) for production as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, So 1 Chron. 4.17. <hi>And ſhe bare</hi> Miriam <hi>and</hi> Shammai, <hi>&amp;c. She bare,</hi> is the word in this text of <hi>Job:</hi> We may take it either way; the ſenſe is cleare according to our tranſlation, that <hi>Job</hi> ſends this curſe beyond his birth-day, even to the night wherein he was conceived; Or if we referre it no further back then to his birth: It is as if he had ſaid, whether I were borne by night or by day, let the time of my birth be accurſed; if it were upon the day time, <hi>let that day periſh wherein I was borne</hi>; Was I borne in the night? <hi>let that night periſh wherein it was ſaid a man-child is brought forth</hi>; This diſtribution notes a reſolvedneſſe to curſe it; and leaſt he ſhould miſſe the time of the day, he curſes both the diviſions of time, in every day. As <hi>Benhadad</hi> in his charge for the taking of of thoſe young-men, that came out of <hi>Samaria,</hi> to ſhew how fully he was reſolved to have them taken, ſaith, <hi>Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive, or whether they be come out for warre, take them alive,</hi> 1 King. 20.18. as if he had ſaid, I'le have them taken whatſoever comes on't, or for whatſoever they come, they ſhall not eſcape. Or as <hi>Herod,</hi> who, that he might be ſure to ſlay Chriſt in his infancy, commands all infants to be ſlaine: So <hi>Job,</hi> that the curſe might not miſſe the time of his birth-day, curſes all the time of that day, the day, and the night. For though a man be borne in the night, yet that is not called his birth-night, but his birth-day: And to be borne, is to come into the light, though the birth-time be the darkeſt of the night. Hence the Heathen called their <hi>Juno,</hi> whoſe helpe they invoked in time of womens travell <hi>(Deam lucinam) the goddeſſe bringing into light.</hi>

               <p>So much for the opening of this curſe, both in the generall and in the parts of it, reſpecting the object day and night. In the next words hee cuts out or proportions a ſpeciall curſe, as the portion
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:98733:175"/>
of each part; The day hath a ſhare, and the night hath a ſhare, each by it ſelfe. Before I open this box of curſes any further, I ſhall obſerve ſomewhat from the diſcovery thus farre made.</p>
               <p>And firſt I muſt anſwer a doubt ariſing upon the whole matter; for it may be queſtioned upon this you have already heard, though we carry on his complaint no further, How <hi>Job</hi> can be ſet up with ſo much admiration for a mirrour of patience, who makes ſuch bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter complainings, and breakes out into ſuch diſtemper'd paſſion, curſing <hi>his day?</hi> May he not rather be an example of impatience? an unimitable patterne of an unquiet and uncompoſed ſpirit? Are theſe the words of patience and ſobriety? Is this the language of ſubmiſſion and humility. <hi>Curſed be my day?</hi> He ſeemeth to be ſo farre from patience, that he wants prudence, ſo farre from grace, that he wants reaſon it ſelfe and good nature; his ſpeeches report him mad or diſtracted, breaking the bounds of modeſty and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſtriking that which had not hurt him, and ſtriking that which he could not hurt, his birth-day. In this <hi>Job</hi> appeares much like that proud Emperour <hi>Zerxes,</hi> of whom the Hiſtorian reports,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lotus.</hi>
                  </note> that when the raging <hi>Helleſpont</hi> broke downe the bridge that he had made over it, he in a rage cauſed ſome hundreds of ſtripes to be inflicted as a puniſhment on thoſe waters, and cauſed a paire of ſhackles to be caſt upon thoſe waves, to teach them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: was not this madneſſe? what cared the waters for ſtripes? or why ſhould <hi>Zerxes</hi> take revenge upon the waters? And was not <hi>Iob</hi> as mad? what cared his day for the curſe? or why ſhould <hi>Iob</hi> take revenge upon his day? But as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Was the Lord diſpleaſed againſt the rivers? was his wrath againſt the ſea?</hi> Should the Lord ſet his anger againſt irrationall creatures? Doubtleſſe he doth not. Therefore enquire further into the matter, So did <hi>Iob</hi> fall out with his day? was he angry with his day? This is yet further to be enquired into and anſwered.</p>
               <p>There are ſome who on the one hand proſecute the impatience of <hi>Iob</hi> with much impatience, and are over paſſionate againſt <hi>Iobs</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Moſt of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> writers tax him at the leaſt as bordering upon blaſphemy, if not blaſpheming. Nay they cenſure him as one taking heed to, and much depending upon Aſtrologicall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, as if mans fate or fortune were guided by the conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heaven, by the ſight and aſpect of the Planets in the day of his nativity, as if <hi>Iob</hi> had obſerved ſome malignant conjunction of the Starres upon that day: As if like the ſuperſtitious Heathen,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:98733:175"/>
he divided dayes into lucky and unlucky, good dayes and bad dayes: as if he had denied the providence of God, at leaſt the particular providence of God in guiding individuall perſons or paſſages of our lives here below.</p>
               <p>There are others who carry the matter as farre on the other hand, altogether excuſing, and which is more, commending, yea applauding <hi>Iob</hi> in this act of curſing his day: they make this curſe an argument of his holineſſe, and theſe expoſtulations as a part of his patience; contending firſt, that theſe did only expreſſe (which he ought) the ſuffering of his ſenſitive part, as a man, and ſo were oppoſite to ſtoicall Apathy, not to chriſtian patience, to a ſtone, not to a man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he ſpake all this, not only according to the law of ſenſe, but with exact judgement, and according to the law of ſoundeſt reaſon; And which is farre more, that he ſpake all this, not out of impotent anger againſt his day, but out of perfect love unto his God: That he ſpake this curſe, not in his owne, but in the behalfe of God, pleading for the providence of God againct the ſurmiſes of men: For (ſay ſome) he feared leaſt his friends ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him (whom they ever tooke for a godly man) thus afflicted ſhould accuſe the providence of God. As if he had ſaid, I would I had never been borne, or it had been better for me not to have been borne, rather then I ſhould be an occaſion for any to take up hard thoughts againſt God, or that his Name through my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings ſhould ſuffer. So that the love of God, not wearineſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or unwillingneſſe to be under the croſſe, conſtrained him thus to ſpeake: And <hi>if he was beſides himſelfe,</hi> (as the Apoſtles word is) It was to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13.</p>
               <p>I doe not ſay, but that <hi>Iob</hi> loved God, and loved him exceedingly all this while, but whether we ſhould ſo farre acquit <hi>Iob,</hi> I much doubt, eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe ſaith, Chap. 42. <hi>I have ſpoken, and I will ſpeake no more:</hi> If <hi>Iob</hi> had ſpoken ſo much, from the love of God, and to the honour of God in this curſe, having ſpoken once, he ought to have ſpoken againe and againe: And had it been ſo, ſurely <hi>Job</hi> might have ſpared his repentance, as to this point, and needed not have ſaid, <hi>Now I abhorre my ſelfe, and repent in duſt and aſhes</hi>; If <hi>Iob</hi> had ſpoken all this according to exact reaſon and the exactneſſe of holineſſe, he had no reaſon to repent, eſpecially to repent in duſt and aſhes, for what he had thus ſpoken: No man needs abhorre himſelfe for that, wherein he both intentionally and actually honours God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:98733:176"/>We muſt therefore ſtate it in the middle way, that <hi>Job</hi> is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rigidly to be taxed of blaſphemie or prophaneneſſe, nor totally to be excuſed, eſpecially not flatteringly commended for this high complaint. I conceive it muſt be granted, that <hi>Job</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered much frailty and infirmity, ſome paſſion and diſtemper in this complaint and curſe; yet notwithſtanding we muſt aſſert him for a patient man, yea for a mirrour of patience; and there are five things conſiderable for the clearing and proofe of this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>As firſt, conſider the greatneſſe of his ſuffering, his wound was very deepe and deadly, his burden was very heavy, only not intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable: The ſufferings of Chriſt, being exceeding great, cauſed him to complaine, that his <hi>ſoule was exceeding ſorrowfull even unto death,</hi> Mat. 27.38. Yet in this complaint, there was not the leaſt imaginable touch of impatience. When he hung upon the croſſe, he cried out, <hi>My God my God why hast thou forſaken me, verſe</hi> 46. yet in this cry, no impatience. To cry out for every light touch, argues indeed a vaine and an impatient ſpirit: But he that ſometimes fetches a groane under a weight of ſorrow, is yet untoucht either in his wiſedome or in his patience. In ſuch a caſe to cry out, is a diſcovery of humane frailty, but not of ſinfull frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: grace doth not take away ſence, it heightens nature, but it doth not aboliſh it. Conſider how much <hi>Job</hi> endured, and then you will find little impatience, though he complained much.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider the multiplicity of his troubles: They were great and many; many little afflictions meeting together, make a great one, how great then is that which is compoſed of many great ones? Many pebble ſtones will make a heavy burden, how then is he burdened, who hath (if ſuch a thing may be ſuppoſed) many mil-ſtones upon his back? <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions came upon him as an Army, and encompaſt him round about. He had many particular afflictions, any one of which might make a very patient man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, then <hi>Job</hi> who bare them all, was not impatient, though he complained.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider the long continuance of theſe great and many troubles, they continued long upon him, ſome ſay they continued divers yeares upon him. We uſe to ſay, <hi>a light burden is heavy, if the journey be long</hi>; a man may beare any thing for a brunt, or for a ſpurt, but to have a ſad load continued upon the ſhoulders all the day, pinches ſoare. <hi>Jobs</hi> load lay upon him day and night, day
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:98733:176"/>
after day, yea moneth after moneth, chap. 7.3. <hi>I am made</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to poſſeſſe moneths of vanity:</hi> yea as ſome have calculated them, his troubles continued yeare after yeare for ſeven yeare. Though a man make ſome, yea great complainings, under many great, long laſting afflictions, an eaſie apologie may acquit him of impatience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider this, that his complainings and acts of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience were but a few, but his ſubmiſſions and acts of meekneſſe under the hand of God, were very many. Now we know, that one or a few acts, though evill, doe not denominate a perſon, eſpecially when they are ballanced by many acts of good in the ſame perſon, and about the ſame thing. How often doth <hi>Job</hi> in this Booke, breath forth patience, humility, faith, love, and ſtedfaſt truſt in God, whatſoever he ſhould doe with him: theſe ballance his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings, yea indeed they over-ballance them, ſo much, for the ſetling of our judgements, about <hi>Jobs</hi> patience, that they leave not ſo much as an opinion of the contrary.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take this into conſideration, that though he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, and complaine bitterly, yet he recovered out of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings; he was not overcome by impatience, though ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient ſpeeches came from him: he recalls what he had ſpoken, and repents for what he had done. See how he ſubmitteth himſelf, (<hi>Cap.</hi> 42.) how low he lies before God, <hi>even in the duſt,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>I will ſpeake no more.</hi> If I have been impatient, I will uſe no more impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſpeeches; If I have been impatient, I repent of it, <hi>I repent of it in dust and aſhes:</hi> To repent of impatience, takes away the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of impatience; and to ſay I will doe evill no more, gaines (through the mercy of God in Chriſt) an acceptance of us, as if we had done no evill; A man is a conquerour, though in the battell he ſuffers many foiles, and receiveth many wounds, and looſeth much blood; though for a great while in the day a man be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, yea though a whole Army be worſted, yet if in the evening, in the cloſe of the day, he and they keep the field and foile the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the day is wonne, and victory goes on this ſide. <hi>Job</hi> was in a great battell, in a ſore fight of afflictions, though it be granted that he received ſome wounds, and had ſome foyles, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lookes as if he had been beaten, and ſpeakes as if he had been overcome, yet in the cloſe, in the evening, in the making up of all, he went away a conquerour: the concluſion was victory and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Iob</hi> had the victory, and God had the glory: Therefore as the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:98733:177"/>
Apoſtle <hi>Iames, Chap.</hi> 5.11. when he ſpeakes of enduring with joy, referres us to the end of <hi>Iobs</hi> day of trouble, to the end which the Lord made, <hi>yee have heard</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the patience of</hi> Job, <hi>and have ſeene the end of the Lord.</hi> So looke to the end of <hi>Iob,</hi> to the end (which through the ſtrength of the Lord) <hi>Job</hi> made, and there you ſhall ſee patience having a perfect worke, or <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect worke of patience.</hi> Looke not alone upon all the actings of <hi>Iob,</hi> when he was in the height and heate of the battell; looke to the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, he was ſo very patient in the beginning, though vehemently ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that Satan had not a word to ſay; looke to the end, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, but <hi>Iob</hi> was a patient man, full of patience, a mirrour of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, if not a miracle of patience; a man whoſe face ſhined with the glory of that grace above all the children of men.</p>
               <p>So much for that Queſtion, I ſhall now adde two or three points of Obſervation.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing then that we may obſerve from hence is this, If we compare <hi>Iob</hi> in the two former Chapters, with <hi>Iob</hi> in the third, we ſhall find that the caſe is altered with him, he ſcarce ſpeakes like the ſame man. Hence obſerve in the generall,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the holieſt perſon in this life, doth not alwayes keepe in the ſame frame of holineſſe.</hi> There is a great deale of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene what he ſpake in the former chapters, when he heard of and felt theſe things firſt, and what he ſpeakes now. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord. Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evill?</hi> This was the language we lately heard, but now curſing: certainely his ſpirit had been in a more holy frame, more ſedate and quiet then now it was. At the beſt in this life we are but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, yet at ſome time we are more imperfect then we are at an other: Faith is never very ſtrong, yet at ſome time faith is weaker then at an other: Our love to Chriſt is never very hot, but yet at ſome time it is colder then at another, we cannot keepe it in the ſame degrees of heate. A man at one time can both doe and ſuffer, and a while after he can neither doe nor ſuffer as he could at that time, he is out of frame, and bungles in both. Take the life of a Chriſtian all together, it is a progreſſe, it is a continuall growing, yet take his life apart, conſider him in every circumſtance and ſtage of his life, then there are many ſtops and ſtands in his life, yea many declinings: As it is with a child, Take a child, and his life from his birth to his full age is in a growing condition, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:98733:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him at ſome particular time, and the child may abate, the child may not only not be ſtronger, but much weaker then he was a yeare or a moneth before. So it is with us from the firſt houre of our ſpirituall life, till we attaine full ſtature of it in Chriſt; Onely this is our comfort, that in Heaven our ſoules ſhall be ſet up in ſuch a frame of holineſſe, as ſhall never be moved nor abated in the leaſt degree; Looke in what frame the hand of God ſets us up in that day, we ſhall continue ſo to all eternity, and that will be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt exquiſite frame both of holineſſe and of delight. But now wee are up and downe, one day patient, and another day impatient, now beleeving, and another day diſtruſting, now the heart melts and is very tender, anon it is very hard and relentleſſe. How meeke a man was <hi>Moſes,</hi> not ſuch a man for meekeneſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the whole earth, and yet at one time paſſionate, and at another ſo angry, that he ſpake <hi>unadviſedly with his lips.</hi> How full of faith was <hi>Peter</hi> at one time, how reſolv'd to ſtick cloſe to Chriſt, yet ſhortly after, how full of feare, and for feare denying Chriſt. We who receive good gifts and perfect guifts, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to turnes and variations,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.17.</note> onely he from whom <hi>every good and perfect guift comes,</hi> is without <hi>variableneſſe or ſhadow of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly obſerve, <hi>That great ſufferings may fill the mouthes of holieſt perſons with great complainings. Job</hi> was not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, but afflicted greatly; <hi>Job</hi> did not only complaine, but he complained greatly: You ſee what complainings <hi>David</hi> made in his great troubles, Pſal. 77.2. <hi>In the day of my trouble I ſought the Lord, my ſore ran in the night and ceaſed not, my ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be comforted.</hi> So <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88.3. <hi>My ſoule is full of troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 15. <hi>I am afflicted and ready to dye from my youth up, while I ſuffer thy terrours I am diſtracted. Hezekiah</hi> under the greatneſſe of his affliction, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.14.) ſaith, <hi>Like a Crane or Swallow ſo did I chatter, I did mourne as a Dove,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jeremie,</hi> a holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſpeakes, if not out-ſpeakes <hi>Job</hi> in his complaint, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.14. <hi>Curſed be the day wherein I was borne, let not the day wherein my mother bare me be bleſſed; Curſed be the man who brought tydings to my father, ſaying, a man-child is borne unto thee</hi>; He doth not only curſe his birth-day, but the meſſenger of his birth: And he curſes both with a word of deeper deteſtation then <hi>Job</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to eaſe or empty his troubled ſpirit by, <hi>Jobs</hi> word ſignified

                  </note> 3.14, in each of theſe <hi>Jeremie</hi> went a ſtraine of impatience beyond <hi>Job,</hi> and yet holy <hi>Jeremie</hi> ſtill. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith the ſame Prophet, <hi>Chap,</hi> 8.14.) <hi>hath put us to ſilence, and given us waters of gall to drinke, becauſe we have ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> When we remember our own ſinnes, we have reaſon to be ſilent, though the Lord feed us with waters of gall, bitter waters. And if we be ſilent and open not our mouthes, becauſe we have ſinned, he beares with our cry, as we are pained: He knowes whereof we are made, and remembers that we are but duſt. A little thing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles our fleſh, therefore it is no wonder, if fleſh and blood cry out in great troubles, though they be ſubdued by grace unto the ſpirit. And if God (in this caſe) beare with us, we ought alſo to beare with one another, and not be ſcandaliz'd or take offence, when we ſee good men mourning and lamenting under the evills which they endure. He that underſtands man, will compaſſionate the ſorrowes, not queſtion the ſincerity of a complaining, groaning brother.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Job</hi> complaineth bitterly, and he curſeth; but what doth he curſe? He curſeth <hi>his day.</hi> Obſerve from thence. <hi>That Satan with his utmoſt power and policie, with his ſtrongeſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and aſſaults, can never fully attaine his ends upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi> What was it that the Devill undertooke for? was it not to make <hi>Job</hi> curſe his God? and yet when he had done his worſt, and ſpent his malice upon him, he could but make <hi>Job curſe his day</hi>; This was farre ſhort of what Satan hoped: Doubtleſſe when the Devell heard the word, <hi>curſed,</hi> come out of <hi>Jobs</hi> mouth, he then began to prick up his eares and triumph, ſurely now the day is mine, now he will curſe his God; but at the fall of that word <hi>curſed be the day,</hi> Satans hope falls, and downe goes he. That word <hi>day,</hi> was darkeneſſe to the Devill, and as the ſhadow of death; he failes of his end, and is confounded, he goes away aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and hath not a word more to ſay, but leaves his friends to ſay the reſt. The <hi>gates of Hell</hi> ſhall never prevaile againſt thoſe who are founded on free grace, and the rock Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly obſerve, <hi>That God doth graciouſly forget, and paſſe by the diſtempered ſpeeches and bitter complainings of his ſervants, under great afflictions. Job</hi> ſpake this curſe, but when God comes to queſtion with <hi>Job,</hi> we doe not heare a word or title of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:98733:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this curſe charg'd upon him: God takes notice <hi>that hee had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him the thing that is right,</hi> Chap. 42.7. God commends him for what he had ſpoken well, but <hi>Job</hi> doth not heare a word of what he had ſpoken ill: When the iniquity of his ſpeeches <hi>was ſought for, there was none, and his failings, they could not be found, for God had pardoned them,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeakes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> Chap. 42.20. Our Lord Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that of every idle word you ſhall give an account at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by your words you ſhall be justified, and by your words you ſhall be condemned,</hi> Math. 12.36, 37. We had neede looke to our words, God writeth what we ſpeake, and keepeth a booke of all we ſay. You will ſay, How then were <hi>Jobs</hi> diſtempered complainings forgotten, and all taken for well ſpoken, that he had ſpoken? I anſwer, Firſt, None of <hi>Jobs</hi> were idle words, though there was errour in his words. Secondly, His right words were more then his erring words. Thirdly, His heart was upright when his tongue ſlipt. Fourthly, He repented of thoſe ſlips and errours. And laſtly, God forgiving, blotted them out of his booke for ever. Further (in a ſenſe) we may ſay, that God makes allowance to his people for ſuch failings: not an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of connivence and diſpenſation, God doth not diſpenſe with any to doe the leaſt evill, or expreſſe the leaſt impatience in their ſpeeches; but he makes an allowance of favour and compaſſion, conſidering their weakeneſſe and the ſtrength of temptation, he abates proportionably, when in ſuch a condition they ſpeake im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently; though their actions and ſpeeches want ſome graines of that weight which they ought to have, yet weighing them in the ſcale of favour with his gracious allowance, they go for currant, and paſſe in account with God, as good and full pay of that duty he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from us, and we owe unto his Majeſty.</p>

               <p>WE have already given the Analyſis and parts of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: The ſubject of it is <hi>Jobs</hi> curſe upon his day. The firſt ſection of it in the nine firſt verſes, containes the matter and the method of that curſe.</p>
               <p>And he curſeth his day, Firſt, In generall (ver. 1.) <hi>After this,</hi> Job <hi>opened his mouth, and curſeth his day.</hi> Secondly, He curſeth it in both the parts of it, (ver. 3.) <hi>Let the day periſh in which I was borne, and the night in which it was ſaid, there is a man-child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe ſix verſes which remaine, appertaining to the firſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he affixes a particular curſe to each part of his day; taking a day, for a naturall day, and then dividing it into day and night, he gives a ſpeciall curſe to each of theſe parts; A curſe upon the day, and a curſe upon the night.</p>
               <p>The curſe powred out upon the day, lies in the fourth and fift verſes of this Chapter, <hi>Let that day be darkneſſe, let not God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it from above, neither let the light ſhine upon it; let darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and the ſhadow of death staine it, let a cloud dwell upon it, let the blackneſſe of the day terrifie it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are ſix diſtinct branches of shis curſe.</p>

               <p>Here we are to take <hi>day,</hi> not for a naturall day, but for the day as it is the continent of light, the whole ſpace of time from the riſing to the ſetting of the Sun. Now ſaith he, <hi>Let the day be darkeneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:98733:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>Be darkeneſſe.</q>
               <p>There is a great aggravation of miſery in that, as Chriſt ſpeakes, Mat. 6.23. <hi>If the light that is in thee be darkeneſſe, how great is that darkeneſſe?</hi> While <hi>Job</hi> wiſheth that his very day, which is light, ſhould be darkeneſſe, how great a darkeneſſe doth he wiſh unto it; And if the day be darkeneſſe, how darke muſt the night of that day be?</p>
               <p>Then againe, <hi>Let the day be darkeneſſe,</hi> he doth not ſay, let the day be miſtie, or cloudy, or duskie, or darke, he doth not wiſh it like that day deſcribed, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.6. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that the light ſhall not be cleare nor darke</hi>; but he ſaith, <hi>Let it be darkeneſſe.</hi> Both in Scripture and common language, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts are emphatically ſignificant, and carry more then an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſenſe in them; When <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 27.1. <hi>The Lord is my light,</hi> there is more in it then if he had only ſaid, the Lord doth enlighten me: So to ſet forth the wofull condition of thoſe who are unregenerate or in the ſtate of nature, the Apoſtle tells them, Epheſ. 5.8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkeneſſe, not only in the darke, but darkeneſſe:</hi> So here to expreſſe how great a curſe he wiſhes upon his day, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let the day be darkeneſſe it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now darkeneſſe may be taken two wayes: Either
<list>
                     <item>Properly, or</item>
                     <item>Improperly.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Proper darkeneſſe is nothing elſe but a privation of light, it is no poſitive creature, it hath no cauſe in nature, but is the conſequent of the Sunnes abſence; When <hi>Job</hi> wiſhes, <hi>let that day be darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> we may underſtand it of this darkeneſſe, as if he had ſaid, whenſoever that day commeth about, in the recourſe and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the yeare, let it be darkeneſſe, or a very darke and gloomy day. This had bin a great evill upon his day. This kind of darkeneſſe was one of the 10 plagues with which God ſmote <hi>Egypt.</hi> And yet there is darkeneſſe, which is a greatet evill then this, I meane darkeneſſe improperly taken: and ſo frequently in Scripture any ſorrowfull, troubleſome, ſad condition, is expreſs'd by darkeneſſe. A condition of darkeneſſe is a ſad condition, a darke day is as much, as a ſad day; So then, <hi>Let that day be darkeneſſe,</hi> that is, let it for ever be accounted a ſad and ſorrowfull day. Thus the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> Chap. 2.2. calls a day of great trouble, <hi>a day of darkeneſſe and gloomineſſe, a day of clouds and of thicke darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:98733:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
When <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.2. would ſhew by way of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, the ſad and evill condition of old age comparatively to youth, he unfolds it by darkeneſſe; <hi>remember now thy creatour in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> make haſte, ſerve God betime; But what needs ſuch haſte? I tell thee why, as times change, ſo thy eſtate will change: Evill dayes will come, I therefore counſell thee to doe it, <hi>while the evill dayes come not, nor the yeares draw nigh, when thou ſhalt ſay, I have no pleaſure in them: while the Sunne, or the light, or the Moone, or the Starres be not darkened</hi>; A day without pleaſure, is a day without the Sunne, take away the joy of a day, and you take away the light of a day. Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have the Sunne, and the Moone, and the Starres, all kind of light and comfortable influences upon them; but theſe will be darkened and ecclipſed when old-age cometh, that will put out or at leaſt obſcure your light, your day will be gone, and your night will have neither Moone nor Starre in it, therefore worke while you have light, that is, while you have health and ſtrength of body, while you have freedome and activity of ſpirits, fit for that great ſervice, <hi>remember,</hi> that is, know and ſerve your Creatour.</p>
               <p>So in the Text, we may take darkeneſſe improperly, as darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe notes an uncomfortable eſtate, and it is uſed in Scripture to note a two-fold uncomfortable eſtate. Firſt, An eſtate of ſinne; Secondly, An eſtate of miſery. This latter darkeneſſe is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the former. The Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> Chap. 9.2. ſpeakes of <hi>the people that ſate in darkeneſſe:</hi> which is repeated, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.16. that is, in the darkeneſſe of ignorance, of ſin and guilt; They had naturall light enough, and they had civill light enough, aboundance of outward comforts: they had health, and ſtrength, and riches, and peace, and plenty, <hi>but they had not a Chriſt</hi> to take away their ſins, and cleanſe their conſciences, and therefore they were a people that ſate in darkeneſſe. <hi>Jobs</hi> curſe intends not this darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſin, but that other improper darkeneſſe, the darkeneſſe of ſorrow, the darkeneſſe of penall evill; As if he had ſaid, let ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſadneſſe over-ſhadow, let mourning and teares over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme, let calamity and trouble for ever poſſeſſe the day upon which I was borne.</p>
               <q>Let not God regard it from above.</q>
               <p>Here is a ſecond part of the curſe, and a more grievous curſe then the former.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The learned Hebricians obſerve ten ſeverall Names of God in Scripture, three of which note his <hi>Being. Jehovah, Jah, Ehejeh,</hi> Three his <hi>Power. El, Eloah, Elohim.</hi> Three his <hi>Governement. Adonai, Shaddai, Jehovah Tſebaoth.</hi> One his <hi>Excellency,</hi> or <hi>Super-excellency.

               <p>Secondly, The word ſignifies to have a care of a thing, to have a thing or perſon in account as well as to call unto account: to take care and be watchfull over another for good, is our regarding of it. In this ſenſe the word is uſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.12. where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking concerning the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is a Land which the Lord thy God careth for, (Careth for)</hi> is the ſame word with this, and this Text may well be expounded by that which followes as the meaning of it, <hi>The eyes of the Lord thy God are alwayes upon it, from the beginning of the yeare even unto the end of the yeare.</hi> So that to have regard to a thing, to a day, or to a perſon, is to make account of theſe, to take care for theſe for their good, as a part of ones charge or duty, or as an act of grace and bounty.

But the thing I aime at in alledging this Text, is to give light to the point in hand, what it is to <hi>regard a day.</hi> The Apoſtle is plaine, that <hi>Mans regarding of a day,</hi> is to have a day in ſpeciall account, as thoſe dayes were, which God inſtituted among the <hi>Iewes</hi> for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ends, commanding them to obſerve them, and promiſing a bleſſing in their obſervation. Proportionably Gods regarding of a day, is the ſpeciall eſteeme he hath, or care he takes of it, and the ſpeciall bleſſing he powreth downe upon it. Some practicall truths are hence obſerveable,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider theſe two parts of the curſe, as they are placed in ſucceſſion one after another, or in conjuction one with another, <hi>Let the day be darkeneſſe, and let not God regard it from above.</hi> This may teach us, <hi>That there is no day ſo darke, or condition ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, but if God regard and take notice of it, man may take comfort and rejoyce in it.</hi> Though the day be darkeneſſe, Gods eye will make it light; his regarding is a bleſſing, we never looſe all, till God leaves us. If in the <hi>houre and power of darkeneſſe,</hi> (as Chriſt calls the time of his paſſion) <hi>God doe but lift up the light of his countenance upon us, we ſhall be ſaved. Jobs</hi> wiſh of darkeneſſe, had done his day no great hurt, unleſſe he had taken the eye of God off from it alſo. All the light that is in the world, the light of Sunne, Moone and Starres, is but darkeneſſe to us, if God hide his face; but let Sunne, Moone and Starres hide their faces, let all creatures withdraw their comfort, if God regard us we are
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:98733:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
well: Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> puts the ſting of the curſe in Gods not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and withdrawing from his day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When he wiſhes that God would not regard his day, he deſires God to lay aſide or ſuſpend his continuall worke.</p>
               <p>Obſerve then, <hi>That God doth obſerve and take particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every day.</hi> As all perſons ſhall be accountable to him for their actions, ſo alſo for their time: God will inquire after every inch of time, after every moment of our lives. Many men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not a day, they value not their pretious time, they know not how to ſpend or be rid of it, how to weare it out and paſſe it away: But God obſerves and regards every moment. The Apoſtle calls to <hi>redeeming of time,</hi> Epheſ. 5.16. And he ſubjoynes a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>Becauſe the dayes are evill.</hi> We may give in this of <hi>Iob</hi> for a motive: God regards time, therefore let us redeeme time. If a day be within Gods regarding, ſurely it may command ours.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let not God regard it.</hi> We may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the bleſſing and comfort of every day, depends upon the care and respect of God to it. The eyes of all things looke up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</hi> Why doe all things looke up unto God. It is that God may looke downe upon them: If God looke downe upon the creature, then the creature revives and is refreſhed; there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences from the eye and ſight of God, which are able to quicken the deadeſt times, and make glad the ſaddeſt hearts: As we pray for and humbly expect every day our <hi>daily bread</hi> from God, ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day doth (as it were) expect a daily bleſſing from God, which is his regarding of our dayes.</p>
               <p>It is the greateſt evill that can befall the creature, when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards it not; all the bleſſings of the creature are bound up (like <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> life in the life of <hi>Benjamin)</hi> in that reſpect which God bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to them, and in the care which he hath of them.

with knowing times: but God never winketh at any perſon, or at any times how ignorant ſoever, ſo as to let them goe unpuniſhed, and never call them to an account. Such connivence God hates, as being inconſiſtent both with his providence and his juſtice. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is direct, <hi>They who ſinne without law</hi> (that is, without the knowledge of the law written) <hi>ſhall periſh without law,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the written law, only according to the ſentence of that law, which the finger of nature hath written in their hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. Ignorance ſhall not be ſo winked at, as to be altogether excuſed. How then did God winke? There is a two-fold winking. 1. Of diſreſpect. 2. Of diſpenſation. Gods winking is his direſpecting. He winked at thoſe times, that is, he lightly paſſed them by, his eye was not upon them for good, he regarded them not, in ſuch a manner as to provide for them and ſend amongſt them that great bleſſing, which now (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) he ſends you by my hands, the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>When the bleſſed Virgin heard by that meſſage of the Angell, that ſhe ſhould be mother to the Saviour of the world, ſhe bleſſeth God in this phraſe, <hi>Thou haſt regarded the low estate of thine hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid</hi>; When God in a way of favour doth but looke towards us, our loweſt eſtate is raiſed up, <hi>Thou haſt regarded the low eſtate of thine handmaid</hi>; it is but a looke of gracious regard from God, and all is well with man. On the other ſide, if God take off his eye, winke and diſregard, all is blaſted, yea accurſed, our high eſtate falls, our comforts are ſowred and turned into a lumpe of ſorrow.

               <p>That which before he ſpake againſt his day, by wiſhing it darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he ſpeakes over againe and more in other words, by wiſhing light might be denied and with-held from it; To have no light, is not a bare repetition or an explication of what it is to be in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but it is an addition to, or an aggravation of it: So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. by him that <hi>walkes in darkeneſſe and hath no light,</hi> ſets out the ſaddeſt condition of an afflicted ſoule. No light is not only darkeneſſe, but pure darkeneſſe; As when the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> would advance the glory of God, he ſaith, <hi>God is light, and in him there is no darkeneſſe at all,</hi> (1 Ep. c. 1.) God is pure light, ſo darkeneſſe without light is pure darkeneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let not the light.</hi>] As darkeneſſe, ſo light may be taken either properly for naturall light, that which God firſt created: light was the firſt perfect viſible creature, light was the firſt dayes worke, and by the worke of the fourth was gathered into thoſe heavenly veſſels, the Sunne, Moone and Starres, and there put, that it might be diſpenſed and carried about the world, eſpecially by that chariot of the Sunne. Let this light, this naturall light be with-held, let it not ſhine (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) upon that day. The withdrawing of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light is a great affliction to the world: Light is the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeall of all corporall things; the ſpiritualneſſe of it ſhewes the goodneſſe of it: light is the beauty, and diſcovers all the beauty of the world. As a goodly adorn'd furniſh't roome without a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or a candle, ſuch is the world without light. Light is not only the light, but the life of the world, it quickens and comforts the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature; it is the inſtrument by which all the influences of Heaven are communicated to the earth, which being ſtopt, the courſe of nature ſtops: this cauſed a great Philoſopher to cry out (when at the paſſion of Chriſt the light of the Sunne was totally ecclipſed) <hi>Either the God of nature ſuffers, or the whole frame of nature diſſolves.</hi> Was it not then a dreadfull curſe, when <hi>Job</hi> wiſhes the light (taking it for naturall light) might not ſhine upon his day?</p>
               <p>But further, take it improperly, then, <hi>let not the light ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it,</hi> hath this voice in it, <hi>Let there be no comfort, no joy, no good thing in the compaſſe of that day.</hi> Light in Scripture expreſſes all good; as darkeneſſe all evill; That great bleſſing which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto the Church in the great reſtauration of it, is ſhadowed by light, and by an increaſing light, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.26. <hi>Moreover the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:98733:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
light of the Moone ſhall be as the light of the Sunne, and the light of the Sunne ſhall be ſeven-fold, as the light of ſeven dayes, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the ſtroke of their wound.</hi> We are not to conceive, that there ſhall be ſuch an increaſe of the naturall light of the Moone or of the Sun, but there ſhall be an increaſe of the comfort of the people of God, which ſhall be as if the Moone and the Sun had in one day the light of ſeven dayes, as if the Moone had got the light of the Sun, and the Sun had got a ſeven-fold light more then it had before. And he who is the chiefe, the choiſeſt and moſt tranſcendent bleſſing of all, the joy of all our hearts, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is called <hi>light,</hi> he came as <hi>light into the world, he is the light of the world, the Sonne of righteouſneſſe.</hi> The creator of all good things, found nothing ſo good to ſhew his own goodneſſe by, as light. <hi>Chriſt is light, God is light, and in him there is no darkeneſſe at all.</hi> If then we take <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpeech metaphorically or improperly, <hi>Let not the light ſhine upon that day,</hi> it amounts to a higher loſſe then the former. Truly (ſaith <hi>Solomon) light is ſweet, and it is a pleaſant thing to behold the Sunne</hi>; and we may ſay truly, all ſweetneſſe is light, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very pleaſant thing is as the Sun: Though the Sun ſhine upon us, yet if comfort be removed from us, we are in darkneſſe. Such a condition the Prophet ſpeakes of, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10.) <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that walketh in darkeneſſe and hath no light.</hi> No light, is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, none for the outward man, none for the inner man, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benighted, both deſerted. Hence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is a greater judgement to have good things removed from us, then to have evill inflicted on us.</hi> He ſpeakes more againſt the day, when he ſaith, <hi>let not the light ſhine upon it,</hi> then when he ſaith, <hi>let it be darkeneſſe.</hi> The puniſhment of loſſe is greater then the puniſhment of ſenſe. He that is deprived of all good, is by that act inveſted with all evills. The moſt wofull condition of ungodly men in this life, is expreſt by the puniſhment of loſſe, <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked,</hi> Iſa. 57.21. That they have trouble is not ſo bad, as that they have no peace. And the worſt part of that everlaſting woe which ungodly men ſhall ſuffer is a puniſhment of loſſe: <hi>The heate of the fire ſhall not trouble them ſo much, as the want of light:</hi> God hath fully reſolv'd that their day ſhall be darkneſſe, that himſelfe will never regard it from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, nor let the leaſt beame of the light of his countenance ſhine

upon it; Hence the condition of the damned is called <hi>outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> (Mat. 22.13.) By outer darkneſſe, Chriſt meanes darkneſſe without any ray of light: <hi>Outer darkneſſe</hi> is their portion <hi>who are without,</hi> Rev. 22.15. As the greateſt bleſſing we receive by Chriſt is poſitive, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſonne, that whoſoever beleeveth on him, ſhould not periſh,</hi> (here is the removing of evill) <hi>but have everlaſting life,</hi> here is the bringing in of good: And this is the better part of the bleſſing. So on the other ſide, to have all good, light and life removed, is the moſt bitter part of the curſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, To be under the ſhadow of death, is to be under the influences of death; the influences of death are thoſe feares and doubtings, diviſions and vexations of ſpirit, thoſe diſtractions and diſtempers of mind which fall upon man, in times of imminent and unavoidable danger. <hi>Let the ſhadow of death ſtaine it,</hi> that is, let it be filled with thoſe feares, and cryes, and confuſions, which uſually accompany or prepare the way for death.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Let darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death ſtaine it,</hi> that is, ſuch darkneſſe as dwells with death, ſuch darkeneſſe as fills the houſe of death, the grave: The grave is a darke houſe. We uſe to ſay of that which we would have forgotten, let it be buried in darkneſſe. There is no worke in the grave, and therefore there needs no light in the grave, neither indeed can there be.</p>
               <p>Laſtly thus, <hi>Darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death,</hi> that is, deadly darkneſſe, thick ſtifling darkneſſe, ſuch as is in deepe pits and mines under the earth, where vapours and noyſome dampes doe many times ſtrike men with death. We may here take notice, how <hi>Job</hi> heapes up words, words very like in ſound, and all alike in ſenſe, or concurring to make up one ſenſe: Such amplifications in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are vehement aſſeverations: As <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.20. It is ſaid of the <hi>Baptiſt, He confeſſed and denied not, but confeſſed, I am not the Chriſt</hi>; And thoſe phraſes, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye and not live, I ſhall not dye but live; Thou ſhalt be below and not above.</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> of his day, <hi>Let it be darkeneſſe, let not the light ſhine upon it, let darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death ſtaine it.</hi>

               <p>A cloud, and the dwelling of a cloud, imports ſometime the care and protection of God over his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.38. We reade of a cloud that was continually over the Tabernacle, <hi>a cloud was over it by day, and a pillar of fire by night.</hi> In the fire there was direction, in the cloud protection, and mercy in both.

dwelling of it, notes continued darkneſſe: As if <hi>Job</hi> ſhould have ſaid, If the light doe ſhine upon that day, I wiſh that a curtaine might be drawn perpetually between the world and the Sun, let a cloud dwell before the face of the Sun, which may muffle it and intercept thoſe beames which would enlighten and refreſh the earth.</p>
               <p>Clouds are refreſhings, yet clouds you ſee may prove afflictions: As a cloud is a protection at one time, ſo it may be an affliction at another: As a cloud ſhadowes us from the heate, it is a bleſſing; but as a cloud ecclipſes the light, ſo it is a curſe; The ſame creature may be employed both for a curſe, and for a bleſſing. Yet further <hi>Job</hi> would not only have it a dwelling cloud, but a condenſed cloud. Some clouds are ſo thinne, that the Sun appeares, and light ſhines thorough them; <hi>Job</hi> deſires this may be thick enough, not only to cauſe darkneſſe, but to cauſe blackneſſe: Which is the laſt branch of his curſe upon his day.</p>

               <p>We have heard of darkneſſe before, darkneſſe upon the day. What doth <hi>Job</hi> meane here to call for darkeneſſe upon the night? The night is it ſelfe full of darkneſſe, yea darkneſſe is proper to the night.

How is it then that <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let that night be darkneſſe,</hi> or <hi>Let darkneſſe ſeize upon it?</hi>

               <p>Though it be true, that darkneſſe is proper to the night, yet there are degrees of darkneſſe, and every darkneſſe is not proper to the night.

conſiſteth in its conjunction to the day; hence light and darkneſſe put together, come both under the denomination and notion of <hi>day</hi>; Night is called day, as being a part of the naturall day: Now that which is the chiefe priviledge of the night, this curſe ſtrikes at: <hi>Job</hi> would have it rent and disjoynted from the day, <hi>Let it not be joyned to the dayes of the yeare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Diſunion and diviſion is a great curſe, when the night is not joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the day, it is the curſe of the night. The <hi>Rabbins</hi> have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, why after the worke of the ſecond day was finiſhed, (God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding what he had done) did not adde any approbation to it; when he made the light, which was the firſt dayes worke, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it, <hi>God ſaw the light, and ſaid it was good,</hi> but to the work of the ſecond day, God ſubjoyned no approbation, by ſaying it was good; The reaſon (I ſay) which many of the Rabbins give of it, was this, becauſe then was the firſt diſunion, that made the firſt ſecond, that ever was, <hi>all before was one (ſub uniſſimo Deo) under the one-moſt God</hi>; I ſhall leave this phancie to the Rabbins. But there is ſomewhat in the notion it ſelfe, namely, that diviſion and diſunion are the evills of the creature. The night hath glory by union with the day; the weakeſt things, and the obſcureſt things, havean honour by being joyned with the ſtronger &amp; more excellent.</p>
               <p>And as theſe naturall diſunions are the affliction of naturall things; ſo civill diſunions and civill diviſions are much more the affliction of people and Nations. <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſſures us <hi>that the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Kingdome divided cannot ſtand,</hi> Mark. 3.24. Weake things are ſtrong by union, and that not only by union with the ſtrong, but by union among themſelves. Weake things united are ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, joyne weake with weake and they are ſtrong. And things obſcure, united, are honourable, eſpecially if united with that which is honourable; The glory of the wife is in the band of union with her husband, <hi>ſhe ſhines with the rayes of her husbands honour:</hi> whatſoever naturall or civill excellency is in him, reflects upon her; <hi>The woman is the glory of the man,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7.) in regard of ſubjection: It is mans glory, that God hath given him ſuperiority over ſo excellent a creature. But in another ſenſe, the man is the glory of the woman, ſhe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with him in all his dignity how great ſoever. Thus alſo the day is the glory of the night: The night ſhines by her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the day. <hi>Job</hi> ſues out a divorce betweene them, <hi>Let it it not be joyned to the dayes of the yeare.</hi>

Every <hi>Lunation</hi> made a Moneth, and thirteene <hi>Lunations</hi> made a yeare, their moneth conſiſting of 28 dayes, which is a <hi>Lunary</hi> moneth; So that when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let it not come into the number of the moneths,</hi> he would take away one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall benefit of the night; And it is as if he had ſaid, let that night be uſeleſſe, and ſtand for nothing in the Calender of the yeare. <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under the Heaven,</hi> ſaith the Preacher, (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1.) So every ſeaſon hath ſomething to doe, and there is a purpoſe for every time under Heaven. A purpoſe for ſummer, and a purpoſe for the winter, a purpoſe for the day, and a purpoſe for the night. And for any of theſe to be diſappointed of their purpoſe, is (ſo farre as they are capeable of affliction) their affliction. We may obſerve hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is a great curſe upon any creature, to be made an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creature, to ſtand for nothing.</hi> This is to looſe the end of its being, and therefore it muſt needs looſe the happineſſe of its being. Every thing was (by the Law of its creation) ordained for ſome uſe, and therefore cannot but be unhappy when it is made uſeleſſe. And if it be the glory of inanimate creatures when God will uſe them, or when men make uſe of them for God; how unglorious then is the condition of thoſe men, who are, as (God ſpeakes of that King, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.28.) <hi>Like a deſpiſed broken Idol,</hi> which hath no honour, and is of no uſe, <hi>who are as veſſels wherein there is no pleaſure,</hi> veſſels laid by the walls, (as we ſpeake) laid aſide, as unfit or unworthy to be lookt after, and employed in any publike ſervice.</p>
               <q>Loe, let that night be ſolitary, let no joyfull ſound come therein.</q>
               <p>This ſolitarineſſe of the night may have reſpect to the former words: He would not have it <hi>joyned to the dayes of the yeare,</hi> he would not have it <hi>come in the number of moneths.</hi> What then? then it muſt needs be like a ſolitary widdow, all alone, <hi>Let that night be ſolitary.</hi> Or ſecondly, his meaning may be this, Let there be no meetings that night.

and interrupted. It was the cuſtome of thoſe times, and it is a cuſtome continued in many places to theſe times,<note place="margin">Egyptij <hi>feſtum celiberrimum babuerunt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnum, tum, etiam noctu ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrebantur nuptiae,</hi> Herod. <hi>l.</hi> 2.</note> for friends to meet in the night: and ſuch meetings make night as day; good ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is comfortable; A ſolitary condition is a ſorrowfull condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So then, <hi>Job</hi> compleates his curſe in this verſe, and makes up a full ſumme of miſery upon his night. What can be ſaid more againſt it, then now he ſaith. He had before wiſht it darke in it ſelfe, divided from the day, of no number in the moneths; And now he would not have friends meete or refreſh themſelves by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall communion and loving converſe that night. Much of the comfort of our lives is brought in by the ſociety of friends. Man is defined a ſociable creature, as well as a reaſonable creature, ſolitarineſſe is oppoſite both to the nature and happineſſe of man. <hi>Woe be to him that is alone</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) two are better then one,</hi> and eſpecially in times of trouble. As our comforts are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied upon them that are neere us, ſo our ſorrowes are allayed and eaſed by them. There is a ſolitarineſſe which is the ſweeteſt part of our lives, when we retire a while from the world, from the throng of men and buſineſſe, that we may be more intimate with Chriſt, and take our fill in communion with him. To goe alone, that we may meete with God, is Heaven upon earth; but to be ſo left alone and ſcattered, that we cannot meet with man, is (if not a hell yet) one of the greateſt afflictions upon the earth: Such ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary times are ſad times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let no joyfull voice come therein.</hi>] As if he ſhould ſay, If men will meet that night, and converſe together, let them meet only to mourne together, and let their converſation be made up with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſorrowes; let them only tell each other the ſad ſtories of their afflictions. Thus let them meet to lament together, but let none meet to rejoyce together, let there be no meeting with any joyfull voice that night. He alludes againe to the cuſtome of thoſe times, which were wont to have as meetings in the night, ſo to rejoyce in thoſe meetings; They feaſted with ſongs and muſick, a joyfull voice was in their meetings, Muſick is ſweeteſt in the night: The ſtillneſſe of the night gives advantage to the voice. The <hi>Romane</hi> Hiſtory tells us, that their greateſt feaſts, their moſt luxurious banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and curious muſick was in the night. The Apoſtle alludes to that cuſtome when he ſaith, <hi>They that are drunken, are drunken in the night,</hi> (1 Theſ. 5.6.)

               <p>It is a great evill upon any time, when the voice of joy is taken away from it: it is a great evill upon times, when joyfull meetings can no more be obſerved; when if any do meete, they meete and ſigh together, they meete and lament together, they meete and bemoane each others loſſes and calamities.

Both theſe are pronounced againſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> as a part of that dreadfull curſe which God will powre out upon it, when his wrath comes to the utmoſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.22. <hi>The voice of harpers and muſitians, and of pipers and trumpeters, ſhall be heard no more at all in thee, and the ſound of the mil-stone ſhall be heard no more at all in thee, and the voice of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome and of the bride ſhall be heard no more at all in thee,</hi> That is, O <hi>Babylon,</hi> there ſhall be no joyfull voice any more at all in thee: Not the voice of muſick, no not the voice of a mil-ſtone. We have great cauſe to feare that the joyfull voice may ſuddainely be taken away, not only from our nights, but alſo from our dayes; not only from our houſes, but alſo from our Temples; For the voice of ſin hath bin heard from both. Darkneſſe hath begun to ſeize upon our light; the ſeed of diviſion is not only ſowne, but
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:98733:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſprung up among us; our troubles increaſe, yea our joyfull voice is already changed into the ſound of the trumpet, and the Alarum of War, into the neighings of Horſes, and the <hi>confuſed noiſe</hi> of bloody battels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.5. And which may afflict our hearts more, we heare the mournefull voice of the Widdow crying out, <hi>My Husband my Husband,</hi> We heare the mournefull voice of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, crying out <hi>my Father, my Father.</hi> Husband and Father ſlaine by the ſword, while they went out <hi>to helpe the Lord againſt the mighty.</hi> It is time for us to ſit ſolitary and alone, to mourne <hi>every family apart, and our wives apart,</hi> (Zach. 12.12.) to lift up our voice in prayer night and day, leaſt the joyfull voice be utterly taken away, and for ever ſilenced amongſt us: Leaſt it be ſaid of us as of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (Lam. 1.1.) <hi>How doth the City ſit ſolitary that was full of people? How is ſhe become as a widdow? ſhe that was great among the Nations, and Princes among the Provinces, how is ſhe become tributary?</hi> As that Heathen ſaid of the time paſt, <hi>I had periſhed, if I had not periſhed:</hi> So we may ſay of the time to come; We ſhall mourne, if we doe not mourne, we ſhall be ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, if we ſit not alone. Our nights of ſinfull joy in chambering and wontonneſſe, have bereft us, and will bereave us more of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing joyes. And inſtead of the voice of friend and brother, you may heare only the voice of the <hi>enemy, and avenger:</hi> and that is no joyfull voice. When <hi>Jacob</hi> was enformed of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Eſau</hi> his bloody brother, he put all things in order, and preſently the Text ſaith, Jacob <hi>was left alone,</hi> Gen. 32.24. What, deſerted? did his company run from him? No, it was an elected ſolitarineſſe, not a neceſſitated ſolitarineſſe, he deſired to be alone; and he ſtaid alone that he might not be alone; He ſtaid alone that he might get God neerer in communion with him and his, that his family might not be ſcattered from him, and his houſe left deſolate. So, if we would be voluntarily alone, from the world to be with God, wraſtling out nights in prayer as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, we might (as he did) prevent ſolitary nights, and prevaile with God by the voice of prayer, in the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, and the powerfull cry of his blood, to continue unto us the voice of joy.</p>

               <p>IN the former verſes, <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe curſeth the night, in this he inviteth others to curſe it; that his ſorrow might appeare not only ſerious but ſolemne, he calleth for thoſe who made mourning their profeſſion, and to weepe for and with others, their trade: ſuch as uſed to riſe early, and awaken their companions to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and joyn in prepared and ſtudied lamentation.

And ſo the ſenſe is made out thus, Let them curſe this night, who uſe to curſe the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing every day, whoſe paine hightning and imbittering their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, cauſed them to powre out the moſt bitter and revengefull exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations.</p>
               <p>But I will lay this by, though ſome ſet much ſtore by it, as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall treaſure of invention; For I much queſtion, not only whether this cuſtome of curſing the day amongſt that people, was known unto <hi>Job,</hi> but whether he ever heard of ſuch a people being ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and diſtant from him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall a little open the meaning of that Tranſlation given by <hi>Junius, Let them curſe it who inlighten the day, who are ready to raiſe up Leviathan or the Whale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By thoſe who <hi>inlighten the day,</hi> he ſaith the Starres are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>Let thoſe curſe thee who inlighten the day,</hi> that is, let the Starres curſe thee; <hi>And who are ready to raiſe up Leviathan,</hi> that is, let the windes be againſt thee, let the winds curſe thee, or be a curſe unto thee. The reaſon he gives, is becauſe Starres are (<hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustratores Diei</hi>) the inlightners of the day; And to ſalve it, we muſt not (ſaith he) take the day ſtrictly for a day artificiall, for then the Starres are of no uſe, but for that part of the day na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall which is darke, namely the night; the Starres are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightners of the day, namely of the darke part of the day, the night; And ſo <hi>Job</hi> calls here to the very Starres, that they ſhould oppoſe and trouble that night.</p>
               <p>We reade in that notable hiſtory, <hi>Jug.</hi> 5.20. <hi>That the Starres in their courſes did fight against</hi> Siſera, ſuch expreſſions there are, making as it were the Heavens angry, and the Starres to oppoſe the deſignes of men. The hoſt of Heaven is under the command of the Lord of Hoſts, when he calls them forth to the help of his people. Thus he conceives <hi>Job</hi> inviting the Starres to take part with him in this quarrell againſt his night; Let the Starres curſe the day, thoſe inlightners of the day.</p>
               <p>Then, he underſtands by them that ſtir up <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the winds; thoſe words (<hi>who ſtirre up Leviathan,</hi>) are (ſaith he) a pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſis or deſcription of the winds. The reaſon which he gives is, becauſe when great winds ariſe and blow ſtrongly, that mighty

                  <pb facs="tcp:98733:192"/>

fiſh the <hi>Whale</hi> or <hi>Leviathan</hi> lying at the bottome of the ſea, by the motion of the waters is rouſed and ſtirred up, and ſo mounts to the ſuperficies or top of the water, or appeares above it. Thus the windes raiſe up Leviathan. His ſenſe from both, is, that <hi>Job</hi> ſets the Starres and the windes againſt this night, and bids them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine to make it troubleſome and tempeſtuous. This opinion for the reverence of the Authors name, deſerveth to be looked upon with reſpect, but I ſhould not, (neither doe I) apprehend that to be the meaning of <hi>Job</hi> in this place.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The difficulty is reſolved by making theſe words an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to Fiſher-men, as if <hi>Job</hi> here did but deſcribe the condition of thoſe, or ſhew what by accident doth befall thoſe whoſe trade and art it is to catch Leviathan or the Whale. Theſe take the word <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the proper ſenſe, for that mighty fiſh deſcribed in the 41<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of this Booke of <hi>Job, Canſt thou draw out Leviathan with an hooke? or his tongue with a coard which thou letteſh downe?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leviathan</hi> is derived from <hi>Lavah,</hi> which ſignifieth joyned or coupled together; whence (to note it by the way) the word <hi>Levi,</hi>

Now taking the word thus properly for the fiſh Leviathan, <hi>Job</hi> is conceived to allude to the cuſtome of thoſe who hunt for the Whale: who obſerving the night to be moſt advantagious for that worke, are troubled at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of light, and therefore the Fiſher-men as ſoone as ever they ſaw day begin to breake, curſed the day, as an enemy to their ſucceſſe in purſuing and killing the Whale. That Fiſhing is a buſineſſe of the night, is evident from that ſpeech of <hi>Peter</hi> to our Saviour Chriſt, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 5.5.) <hi>Maſter we have fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hed all night and have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> According to which alluſion, the meaning of <hi>Job</hi> muſt be: As if he had ſaid, I will not ſtrive any longer for words to expreſſe my paſſion againſt this night, let it be blaſted with the curſe of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:98733:193"/>
thoſe who are moſt skillfull in the dialect or language of execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; even with ſuch a curſe as thoſe ſea-hunters the fiſhermen uſe to powre forth upon the day, when it breakes too ſoone for their profit, ſo that they are hindred in catching of Leviathan or the Whale.</p>
               <p>There is a Proverbe amongſt us, <hi>If you ſweare or curſe, you will catch no fiſh</hi>; And it ſeemes theſe were wont to ſweare and curſe when they could not catch. And hence it was a Proverbe in other Countries,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Piſcatore aut nauta maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicentior.</hi>
                  </note> when they would ſet out an enormious ſwearer, or one given to prophane curſing, they ſaid, <hi>He ſweareth,</hi> or <hi>he curſeth like a fiſherman:</hi> A generation of men whom that age had branded on the tongue, whoſe mouthes were full of curſings, and their ordinary diſcourſe, as much oathes as words.</p>
               <p>But againſt this expoſition experience is objected, that the uſuall time of fiſhing for the Whale, is in the day, not in the night. If it be ſo, then the ground of this opinion is quite overthrowne. That ſome kind of fiſhing is a night-worke, the words and practiſe of <hi>Peter</hi> before mentioned, are proofe enough: Whether Whale-fiſhing were exerciſed in the night, I ſhall not much contend to prove, ſeeing I approve but little of that interpretation which is bottom'd and built upon it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I find others, who ſticking to this tranſlation, <hi>(the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Leviathan)</hi> doe yet wave and paſſe by this conceit of night-fiſhing: And they ſay that the curſe here, is not to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their rage againſt the light, becauſe it brings the day; but to the day,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Piſcatores diei maledicunt, in quo ijs non ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit bonus piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe it brought them no ſucceſſe. So that, day is not oppoſed to night, but a good or ſucceſſefull day, to a bad or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeleſſe day of fiſhing. And then the ſenſe is to this effect, that <hi>Job</hi> calls for ſuch a curſe upon his day, as prophane fiſhermen, who attempt to catch the Whale, uſually ſpend upon that unhappy day, wherein they looſe their labour, and after all their hazard and coſt come home empty.</p>
               <p>And when it is objected againſt this opinion; Why doth <hi>Job</hi> mention Leviathan or the Whale, if that be his meaning to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude unto the ſinfull paſſion of diſappointed fiſhermen; for vaine men in that imployment, are as apt to curſe and be paſſionate when they miſſe of their intendments in labouring to catch any kind of fiſh?</p>
               <p>To this anſwer may be given in two things. Firſt, This buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of fiſhing for the Whale, is a buſineſſe of great charge and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:98733:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
greater danger, and becauſe greateſt loſſes raiſe greateſt paſſions, and the higher our diſappointments are, the higher is our language: therefore <hi>Job</hi> who intended here the higheſt and greateſt curſe, wiſhes it paralel with that, which the greateſt curſers belch forth, when (as they pretend) they have greateſt occaſion, yea (as they call reaſon) reaſon to curſe: And who ſhould theſe be but ignorant or idolatrous fiſhermen, and they at ſuch a pinch, when they have loſt the hope of their greateſt gaine. As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, let as bigge a curſe fall upon that night, as ever fell from the mouthes of thoſe prophane fiſhers, not only when they have bin ſucceſſeleſſe in fiſhing for a Herring or a Sprat, but when after all their paines, and coſt they cannot take Leviathan. <hi>Micahs</hi> mother curſed, when the eleven hundred ſhekels of ſilver were ſtollen from her, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.1, 2. To looſe what we hope for, vexes corrupt nature as much as the loſſe of what we have. <hi>They who have not treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to whom godlineſſe is not more the earthly gaine, cannot but be enraged, when the hope of their gaine is gone upon the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We may ſay, he nameth the Leviathan by a Senech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche, one principall for all, or for any; the chiefeſt of a kind is put for all of a kind: And then it is appliable to thoſe ſea-hunters, whatſoever game they purſue. I ſhall touch one way more of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the opinion of thoſe who take Leviathan in this Text for the Whale. We may conceive it thus, that <hi>Iob</hi> doth not here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to fiſhing for the Whale, and ſo to that ſucceſſeleſſe fiſhing which provokes to curſing. But take it in the generall; The Whale (we know) is a very formidable monſter to Sea-men and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the whole Ship with the lading of it, and all their lives being endangered if a Whale ſtrike it. So we may underſtand that of <hi>Iob,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> Chap. 41.25. <hi>When he raiſeth up himſelfe, the mighty are afraid.</hi> Now the Whale being ſo formidable and dangerous to Sea-men; they perceiving the Whale neere them, or themſelves at unawares ready to ſtir up or raiſe the Whale, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly afraid; And as great feare in ſome ſets them a praying, and cauſeth ſtrong prayers, ſo feare in others ſets them a curſing, and cauſeth ſtrong curſes. Prophane marriners, ſeeing themſelves in ſuch imminent danger by the approach of the Whale, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly curſe the day that ever they looſed Anchor or ſet ſaile from the Harbour, the day that ever they fell within the reach of this ſea-monſter, now ready to ſinke their veſſell, and overwhelme them all. Such a curſe <hi>Job</hi> wiſhes upon that night, the night of his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:98733:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as men of this ranke, conceive and bring forth in the day of their moſt preſſing feares, when anguiſh and ſorrow take hold of them, <hi>as travaile upon a woman with child, and they cannot eſcape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have given you the ſumme of thoſe apprehenſions which are offered for the making up of this Expoſition; namely, That the word is here to be taken for that mighty fiſh Leviathan; And that, either in reſpect of thoſe who make it their buſineſſe and goe out purpoſely to catch Leviathan, or of thoſe who unawares are ready to be catcht by Leviathan: The former diſappointed of their hopes, and the latter ſurprized with feares, making a curſe their refuge, and eaſing themſelves by execrations.</p>
               <p>There is a fourth opinion which giveth the ſenſe of theſe words quite another way, though it retaines the ſame tranſlation. For paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the alluſion to fiſhing or cuſtomes of fiſhermen, they make theſe words as a character or deſcription of the extreameſt and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of wicked men; as if <hi>Job</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let them curſe thee that curſe the day, who are ready to ſtirre up Leviathan,</hi> had ſaid, let the worſt or moſt wicked among the children of men curſe this night; And we know, that the worſt of men are moſt for curſing, they curſe deepeſt; as the beſt of men are moſt for prayer, and they pray higheſt and holieſt. So then, <hi>Jobs</hi> mind being to lay the ſoreſt curſe upon this night, thinks or finds his own ſpirit too ſtraight, his owne heart not large enough to doe it; therefore he doth (as it were) call in aide from thoſe Maſters of curſing, Let the moſt expert, the moſt skill'd in curſing, ſuch as are verſt in oathes and blaſphemies, the very dregs and ſcum of men, let them powre out the dreggs, the worſt, the bittereſt of their curſes upon that night.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall we make out this notion, that the vileſt of men are here deſcribed? That we muſt conſider and open further, to ſhew the ſubſtance and dependance of this opinion.</p>
               <p>The worſt and wickeddeſt of men are conceived to be here meant in two expreſſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By them who are ſaid to curſe the day, <hi>Let them curſe it who curſe the day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In thoſe words, <hi>Who are ready to raiſe up Leviathan.</hi> Both theſe are ſuppoſed as deſcriptive circumlocutions of the moſt wicked and vileſt men.</p>
               <p>How ſo?</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>They that curſe the day.</hi> That which a man hates, he is
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:98733:194"/>
forward enough to curſe: Wicked men love darkneſſe, and they hate the light, therefore they curſe the light. Light is of two ſorts, either naturall, that of the Sunne, or metaphoricall, that of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Take light either way; take light properly, for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light: or take light improperly, for the light or the day of knowledge, wicked men and eſpecially the worſt of wicked men will be found curſers of the day. Firſt, They are ſo expreſt in this booke of <hi>Job,</hi> reſpecting the naturall day, <hi>chap.</hi> 24. where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſcribed many acts of violence committed by cruell oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, who know not God, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. he concludes, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>They are of thoſe that rebell againſt the light, they know not the wayes thereof, nor abide in the pathes thereof</hi>; And ver. 16. <hi>In the darke they dig thorough houſes which they had marked for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the day time, they know not the light, for the morning is to them even as the ſhadow of death: If one know them, they are in the terrours of the ſhadow of death.</hi> Men to whom the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is a terrour and light as the ſhadow of death, cannot but curſe the day, whoſe approach hinders them in their night-workes, in their black deſignes and purpoſes. Secondly, Other Scriptures diſcover more deadly hatred in wicked men againſt the light of knowledge, they rebell more againſt the day of grace, then againſt the day of nature, or the naturall day: The former hinders only the outward practiſe of ſinne, but this oppoſes the inward principles of ſinne. We ſee what cold entertainement, yea what war this light found in the world, and why, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19, 20.) <hi>Light is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world,</hi> (that is, Chriſt and the knowledge of his wayes) <hi>and men</hi> (not men in generall, but ungodly men) <hi>loved darkneſſe rather then light</hi>; Why? <hi>Becauſe their deeds were evill,</hi> (evill deeds, and evill doers ſeeke covert in this darkneſſe) <hi>for every one that doth evill hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leaſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> They are ignorant willingly, that they may ſinne more freely: For though they are reſolved to ſin in and againſt the light of knowledge, yet they had rather ſin in and with the darkneſſe of ignorance; no man can ſin with ſo much eaſe and delight in this light, as he can in darkneſſe. A man that hath light in his underſtanding, can hardly ſinne without ſmart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his conſcience: Hence they who love ſin hate knowledge. On this ground it is as cleare as the day, that wicked men are <hi>(Lucifugae)</hi> ſuch as avoide, ſhun and hate the day, no marvell then if they curſe the day; And to be angry with or curſe the day,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:98733:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is an evidence (as cleere as the day) of a wicked man. He that deſires not to know the truth, hath no deſire to practiſe it; And he who hates the knowledge of the truth, hates the practiſe of it; yea he therefore hates knowledge, becauſe he hates practice: This is wickedneſſe at the height. To commit a ſin againſt light, is not ſo great an argument of an evill heart, as to be troubled at the light which rebukes or would prevent the committing of that ſin. Thus we ſee in what ſenſe, by thoſe <hi>who curſe the day,</hi> we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the worſt of wicked men.</p>
               <p>But for the ſecond part, [<hi>Who are ready to raiſe up Leviathan.</hi>] How is this a deſcription of wicked men?</p>
               <p>To make out this, we muſt expound <hi>Leviathan,</hi> not properly for the Whale, but improperly and myſtically for the Devill, that great Leviathan: Under which name, he with all ſpirituall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the oppoſers of Chriſt and of his Church are comprehended by the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.1.) <hi>In that day the Lord with his ſore, great and ſtrong ſword ſhall puniſh Leviathan, the piercing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, even Leviathan the crooked ſerpent, and he ſhall ſlay the Dragon in the ſea.</hi> Now they that raiſe up this miſticall Leviathan the Devill, are ſurely the vileſt men.</p>
               <p>But who doe thus? or how can this be done?</p>
               <p>They are ſaid <hi>to raiſe up Leviathan,</hi> who ſeeke occaſions of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſuch as doe not ſtay till Satan tempts them, but they (as it were) tempt Satan. They are ſo haſty, ſo forward to doe evill, that they think the Devill comes not faſt enough, and therefore they doe even goe out to meete, provoke and raiſe up the Devill, they invite temptation:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Illi parati ſunt ſuſcitare Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan, qui ſlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ad ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiones diaboli implendas,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. <hi>in loc. Qui ſibi ipſis occaſiones quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt peccandi elegantèr di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur ſuſcita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re diabolum.</hi>
                  </note> There is a truth in this, All ſins are not from the temptations of Satan; our own hearts are not only the ſoyle, and have in them the ſeed of all ſin; but they are ſunne and raine, to warme and water thoſe ſeedes that they may grow. And as a godly man (from the new principle at firſt planted in him by the holy Ghoſt) doth often ſtirre up the holy Ghoſt to come and helpe him, he doth not alwayes ſtay till the holy Ghoſt ſenſibly comes, but finding his own weakeneſſe and wants, and deadneſſe to and in duty, he goeth and ſtirreth up the Spirit of God, and prayeth that the holy Ghoſt would breath upon him, quicken and enliven him in prayer and other holy duties; So many ungodly wretches doe not ſtay for Satan, or waite till he comes to tempt them, but they (ſuch is their deſperate wickedneſſe and delight in ſin) wiſh that he would tempt them oftner. They doe not only
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:98733:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
keepe <hi>open houſe,</hi> and <hi>open heart</hi> for him, ready to entertaine and welcome him when he comes, but they goe forth to ſolicit his company and his coming. This is to ſtirre up Leviathan.</p>
               <p>So that the whole ſenſe according to this expoſition may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to you thus, as if <hi>Iob</hi> had ſaid, Let this night be curſed with a grievous curſe, even with as black and foule a curſe as can be moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and faſhioned in the hearts, or ſpit out of the mouthes of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt miſcreants, even of ſuch as are ſo ſet upon ſin, that they hate the light and curſe the day which either the Sun makes in the aire, or which knowledge makes in their hearts, leſt that ſhould ſtop and hinder them in the acting of ſin; yea let ſuch a curſe be upon it, is they uſe to vomit out, who are ſo ſet upon miſchiefe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to their luſts, that they pray in aide from the Devill, to aſſiſt and quicken them in their wickedneſſe; that ſo their naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions being oyled and ſmoothed with his temptations, their motions to ſin, (and indeed to Hell) may be ſwifter and more violent. Theſe are they that give diligence to make their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſure: Theſe are they from whom the kingdome of Hell ſuffers violence, and theſe violent ones (rather then not have it) will take it by force. Surely their damnation ſleepes not, who (leaſt they ſhould not ſin enough) awaken the Devill to ſhew them ſinning opportunities. To ſuch as theſe (according to the interpretation now ſuggeſted) <hi>Iob</hi> commits his night to curſing, <hi>Let them curſe it who curſe the day,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now though there be a truth in the things which are aſſerted in this opinion, taken abſtractedly; though it be a truth that wicked men are ſuch as curſe the day of ayre-light, and the day of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge-light; though they are often ſo madde to be ſinning, that they provoke and tempt the Devill, yet I will not give this for the ſenſe and meaning of the words, rather you may take it and make uſe of it as an Allegory upon, then an Expoſition of the Text.</p>
               <p>The laſt opinion with which I ſhall conclude the opening of the words, is this: That <hi>Iob</hi> in this verſe, doth allude to the cuſtome of his own Countrey, and of other Eaſterne Countries, who had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſons amongſt them, both men and women, whom, upon ſolemne occaſions either of joy or ſorrow, they were wont to hire or call in for reward, to come and helpe them out either in rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing or in mourning. We find mention of ſuch in Scripture divers times, who were thus called and invited or hired to mourne and lament, in times of ſad and ſorrowfull accidents, whether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall

In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.25. We have a record to the ſame effect, concerning the lamentation for <hi>Joſiah.

Againe, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.16. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, the God of Hoſts, the Lord ſaith thus, wailing ſhall be in all streets, and they ſhall ſay in all the high-wayes, Alas, Alas! And they ſhall call the huſbandman to mourning, and ſuch as are skillfull of lamentation to wailing.</hi> Obſerve here dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent mourners, <hi>they ſhall call the huſbandman to mourning and ſuch as are skillfull of lamentation to wailing.</hi> You ſee he ſpeakes of two ſorts of perſons, they ſhall call the <hi>huſbandman</hi> to mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; Husbandmen are ſuch as mourne when they mourne, when they mourne, they mourne indeed, they mourne down-right; but beſides theſe who mourned (<hi>Ex animo</hi>) really, there was another ſort who did but perſonate ſorrow, and act a part in griefe; So ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Call in ſome who are skilfull of lamentation,</hi> men or women who have ſtudied the point, and know how to move a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to heighten an affection beyond that which the plaine huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman can doe; Let the husbandman mourne, but beſides that, let there be art and ſolemnity in the mourning, call in thoſe that <hi>are skilfull of lamentation.</hi> There was a kind of profeſſion, trade or art of mourning; Which is further evidenced, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.2.) Joab <hi>ſent to</hi> Tekoah <hi>to fetch thence a wiſe woman,</hi> (which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in the words following, to be a woman <hi>skilfull in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,) and ſaid unto her, I pray thee faine thy ſelfe to be a mourner</hi>; Thou art a cunning woman, thou knoweſt how to act
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:98733:196"/>
the part and poſtures of a mourner to the life, <hi>Goe to</hi> David <hi>and faine thy ſelfe to be a mourner, and as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead.</hi> And it is obſerved to this day in many places, (and as I have been informed frequently in <hi>Ireland</hi>) that not only friends and neighbours are called to lament at the funerall of their friends and neighbours, but many others no way related, ſcarce ever known to the perſon deceaſed, who come profeſſedly to ſtraine for teares, and make lamentable out-cryes over the dead. To ſuch a cuſtome or profeſſion <hi>Job</hi> here alluding, ſaith, <hi>Let them curſe it who curſe the day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be objected, that this Text ſpeakes of ſuch as curſe the day, and not of ſuch as mourne upon or bemoane the day. That is eaſily removed, becauſe upon thoſe dayes of mourning, they were wont to mixe execrations with their lamentations, and curſes with their teares: crying out, oh the day! alas for the day, oh that ever ſuch a day came! In the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> v. 2. The Lord ſaith, <hi>Sonne of man, prophecy and ſay, thus ſaith the Lord God, howle ye, woe worth the day.</hi> Theſe did curſe the day: and ſuch were hired in that ſenſe to curſe the day. As <hi>Balaam</hi> (who loved the wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe) was hired to curſe the people of God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. So then the curſing here meant, was a dolefull wiſh, that the day had not beene, or that ſuch things had not hapned upon that day: And ſo theſe words, <hi>Let them curſe it who curſe the day, who are ready to raiſe up their mourning,</hi> are only a circumlocution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing thoſe mercinary curſers or mourners: As if <hi>Job</hi> had in more words ſaid thus. Let this night be curſed in as high a ſtraine, and mourned over with as enlarged ſorrowes, as the art and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe, whoſe trade is curſing, and who have teares at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ever did or can put forth, when hired on purpoſe to mourne over the ſaddeſt ſpectacles and moſt calamitous events.</p>
               <p>Now this being taken for a ground-worke, that in thoſe times and Countries, men and women were hired to mourne, and that an art of mourning was then profeſt; the difficulties that are in the Text oppoſing this, are further to be examined: For here ſtill it ſeemeth doubtfull, how this word <hi>Leviathan</hi> can fall in with ſuch an interpretation, or be applied to thoſe hired and profeſſed mourners. Towards the clearing of which, I ſhall a little open three words.</p>

So that in <hi>Job,</hi> to be ready to raiſe up the mourning, notes more then an immediate going about a thing; As we ſay, I am ready to doe a thing, that is, I will or muſt doe it preſently: For it notes alſo a ſtudied readineſſe or preparedneſſe to doe a thing.</p>

               <p>Secondly, The word <hi>(Leviathan)</hi> is derived (according to the opinion of others) from <hi>Lavah,</hi> i. e. joyned or aſſociated.

And <hi>Joſephus</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſtory of his owne ſuppoſed death, ſhewes how all the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> continued a mourning for him thirty dayes. And he adds, directly to this point, That many muſicians were hired, for reward, to leade thoſe ſongs, or direct the ſolemnity of thoſe lamentations.</p>
               <p>This expoſition (upon the ſuppoſition of alluding to that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in mourning, and the allowance of thoſe ſignifications of the word <hi>Leviathan</hi>) hath a cleare and a faire ſenſe, reſpecting the ſeries of the Text: <hi>Job</hi> having ſo farre powred out a curſe upon and lamented his night, he (as it were) calls for thoſe to finiſh and conclude it, who traded in ſuch kind of curſes, and who were skill'd in lamentations.</p>

Or becauſe in thoſe ſolemne ſongs of lamentation, <hi>Leviathan</hi> was a word much uſed, or <hi>Leviathan</hi> was the firſt word of ſome of thoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ſongs; For in execrations, ſtrange, uncouth, dreadfull words were purpoſely uſed, the more to affect and aſtoniſh the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: Now there is no word more dreadfull then <hi>Leviathan,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we take it for that ſea-monſter the Whale, or for that Hell-monſter the Devill. And ſo the meaning is this; <hi>Let them curſe it who curſe the day, who are ready to raiſe up Leviathan,</hi> that is, Let thoſe mourners, who ſing that moſt paſſionate ſong of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which begins with or is entitled <hi>Leviathan.</hi> It is ordinary among us, to call for a ſong, or to call a ſong by the generall ſubject matter of it, or by the firſt word of it. And ſo, many bookes of Scripture have their names in the Hebrew from the firſt word, as the booke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> is called <hi>Bereſith,</hi> or <hi>In the beginning.</hi> And Exodus, <hi>Veele ſemoth,</hi> (that is,) <hi>And theſe are the names:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both begin with thoſe words in the Hebrew. So the ſong which was the forme of thoſe <hi>Lamentations,</hi> might be called <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi> becauſe (ſaith this Authour) it began with that word; and he alledgeth a proverbiall tradition for it out of <hi>Mariana,</hi> which he had received from a <hi>Jew,</hi> that it was forbidden upon the Feaſt-day to raiſe up <hi>Leviathan</hi>; That is, they might not take up that execratory ſong which beginneth with <hi>Leviathan.</hi> I only preſent this opinion, becauſe it ſuites with and illuſtrates the former notion of ſolemne mourning.</p>
               <p>Thus I have with as much ſpeed and clearneſſe as I could, given you the meaning of theſe words. That which favours their ſenſe moſt, who keepe to the word <hi>Leviathan,</hi> is, that this booke ſpeakes afterward of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> to ſhew the power of the creator, in that powerfull creature. And I find the very ſame phraſe of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or ſtirring up <hi>Leviathan,</hi> uſed in that place, <hi>chap.</hi> 41. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>None is ſo fierce that dare ſtirre (or raiſe) him up.</hi> The Hebrew word which there we tranſlate, <hi>ſtirre,</hi> in this third chapter is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:98733:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>raiſe Leviathan.</hi> Yet I rather encline to the latter expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecting mourning, both becauſe it hath the authority of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible to countenance it, our Tranſlators putting <hi>mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> in the Text and <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the margin; As alſo, becauſe it carries a clearer correſpondence and agreement, both with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents and conſequents, both with the matter and with the frame of <hi>Jobs</hi> complaint and curſe in this chapter.</p>
               <p>Taking the words in this ſenſe, that <hi>Job</hi> calls to have his night curſed in ſuch a ſolemne manner, as thoſe hired mourners uſed to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bewaile the dayes of humane calamities, we may obſerve, Firſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That hope of profit will turne ſome ſpirits into any poſture.</hi> Lamenting and mourning is an unpleaſant worke, but profit and reward ſweetens and makes it pleaſant. Some men will be in any action ſo they may get by it, they will mourne for hire, and curſe for hire; So did <hi>Balaam. Balaam</hi> was ſent for to curſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. He made many delayes, and ſeemingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious ſcruples, yet at laſt he go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s about the worke, as black and bad as it was. But what overcame him, and anſwered all his doubts about the undertaking of ſuch a worke? The Text in <hi>Peter</hi> reſolves us, <hi>he loved the wages of unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> He that loves wages, will quickly love any work, which brings in wages. Upon the ſtage you might have any paſſion for your money: Joy and ſorrow, love and hatred, all acted and perſonated (beyond the perſonall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or occaſions of the men) meerely for reward; And (which is the higheſt argument of a mercenary ſpirit) ſome act holineſſe for hire, and are godly for outward gaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In that <hi>Job</hi> calls others to mourne over and condole that night. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſome troubles exceed our own ſorrowes</hi>; And we may want the eyes and tongues of others to expreſſe them by. My heart (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) is not large enough, and I have not art enough to act, much leſſe to aggravate my own afflictions; let them doe it whoſe profeſſion and practiſe it is, <hi>to curſe the day.</hi> Sometimes the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which we receive, and the joy that the ſoule conceives, is more then we can expreſſe or be thankfull enough for: and then we ſend to others, both private Chriſtians and whole Congregations, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to help us, to lend us their hearts and their tongues, their affections and their voices in that Angelicall worke, the praiſes of our God. <hi>Let them bleſſe God who bleſſe the day,</hi> (who are vers'd
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:98733:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in dayes and duties of thankſ-giving) <hi>who are ready to raiſe up their rejoycings. David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Come and heare all ye that feare God, and I will declare what he hath done for my ſoule,</hi> Pſal. 66.16. He had not told them what God had done for his ſoule, but to gaine the help of their ſoules in praiſing God, for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Sometime alſo a Chriſtian is ſo engaged in prayer for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a mercy, and finds his heart ſo much below his ſuite, that he calls out to all thoſe, who have any holy skill in praying, pray for me, pray with me, the buſineſſe is too bigge for me alone. How earneſtly doth <hi>Paul</hi> begge prayers, <hi>Now I beſeech you bretheren, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſts ſake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye ſtrive together with me in prayers to God for me; that I may be delivered,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30.</p>
               <p>As it is thus in praying and rejoycing, ſo it may be in mourning and in ſorrowing; And troubles are very deepe when they exceed our own ſorrowes, as mercies are very great when they are beyond our own praiſes: Wee in this Nation have cauſe to feare ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, even ſuch, as may cauſe us to invite the hearts and ſpirits, the bowels and compaſſions of all the Chriſtians in the world to come and lament over us: we may be forced to ſend not only for the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> thoſe plaine-hearted mourners, but for thoſe alſo who are <hi>skillfull in lamentations</hi>; ſuch as <hi>Jeremie,</hi> to ſet a ſong in the higheſt ſtraines of lamentation, for the bewailing of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, And ſay, let ſuch lament our day as lamented <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> let ſuch lament it, as have lately lamented <hi>Germany,</hi> ſuch as now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ruines and deſolations of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>The firſt comfort of the night is, that though it be darke by the abſence of the Sunne, yet there is ſome light by the preſence and

ſhining of the Starres: And it is a greater comfort in the night, to remember, that though now I have no light but from a glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Starre, yet ſhortly the light of the glorious Sunne will ſhine upon me. But in how darke a condition is the night, when the Sunne is gone and the Starres too; when the Starres are clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from ſhining, and the Sunne ſtayed from riſing.

               <p>When <hi>Job</hi> would have theſe <hi>Starres of the twi-light to be darke,</hi> Heat once takes away a three-fold benefit from the night. Firſt, Theſe Starres are a great ornament to the night; What a glorious ſpectacle is it, to ſee the canopie of Heaven beſpangled with the Starres, as a garment ſet with Studs or Oes of Gold? Secondly, The Starres are a great delight and comfort in the night. Thirdly, The Starres are for direction, and as guides in the night. Hence Sea-men and Travellers mourne when they cannot ſee the Starres. The Starres are the Marriners guide in the night: While his hand is upon the helme, his eye is toward Heaven, and in the Heavens his eye is upon the ſite and motion of the Starres. The woefull condition of thoſe Sea-men in the ſtorme is thus expreſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.20. <hi>Now when for many dayes neither Sunne nor Starre had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</hi> When Sea-men feele a ſtorme in the night, and cannot ſee a Star in the night, their caſe is almoſt deſperate: Though the light of a Star be little, yet the benefit is very great.</p>

                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:98733:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let it looke for light but have none,</hi> There is much in that: He doth not ſay, <hi>Let this night have no light,</hi> but, <hi>let it looke for light and have none.</hi> From this we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the want of that afflicteth us most, which wee expect moſt.</hi> If the night (that is man in the night) did not expect and looke for light, it would not be much troubled with the abſence of light. To looſe our expectation, is more then the loſſe of the thing expected. It is ſaid of <hi>Siſeras</hi> mother (<hi>Judg.</hi> 5.28.) when her ſonne was upon that expedition againſt the people of God, that <hi>ſhee looked out at a window, and cryed through the latteſſe, why is his chariot ſo long in coming? why tarry the wheeles of his chariot?</hi> She looked for a victorious ſucceſſe and rich ſpoiles, for <hi>her wiſe Ladies anſwered her, yea ſhe returned anſwer to her ſelfe; Have they not ſped, have they not divided the prey? to every man a damſell or two, to</hi> Siſera <hi>a prey of divers colours,</hi> &amp;c. This cut her to the heart, that ſhe looked for great booty, and reckoned upon a victory, when <hi>Siſera</hi> was faſt nailed through the temples, never to returne.</p>
               <p>That man is greatly burdened, from whom others expect much, but he who expects much, is in danger to be more burdened. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.116. <hi>Let me not be aſhamed of my hope.</hi> As ſhame ariſes from doing a thing againſt knowne light and common principles, ſo alſo from looſing or ſuffering a thing againſt known hope and common expectation. It is noted as an aggravation of that peoples affliction in the Prophet, <hi>Wee looked for peace and behold no good came, and for a time of health, and behold trouble,</hi> Jer. 8.15. For a people to be in expectation of ſome great mercy, doubles the ſorrow of their miſcarriage: Now in theſe times, wee being in our night of trouble, and (as it were) looking when day will breake, when our peace will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, when truth will prevaile and be ſetled, when errour and the abettors of it ſhall be overthrowne. How would it augment our ſorrowes, if we looking for theſe mercies ſhould not have them? As it is a greater affliction to be miſerable when we have been happy, ſo when we have long hoped to be happy. God expreſſes himſelfe as much troubled, when he looſes his expectation from us: It provokes the Spirit of God to anger againſt us, when he looks for the fruits of his care and love in our obedience and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth none, (Iſa. 5.) <hi>God looked that his vineyard ſhould have
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:98733:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
brought forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. He loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for judgement, and behold oppreſſion, for righteouſneſſe and behold a cry:</hi> This diſapoointment provoked the Lord to lay his vineyard waſt. So in the Goſpell, when Chriſt cometh to the fig-tree three yeares, ſeeking or looking for fruit and findeth none. What then? <hi>Cut it downe</hi> ſaith Chriſt, he is very angry thus miſſing his expectation. Now, as it provokes the anger of God to come looking upon man, his creature for duty and finds none; ſo it doth likewiſe exceedingly grieve the ſpirit of man, when he lookes to God for mercy and findes none; And how juſt is it that God ſhould croſſe our expectation, when we ſo often croſſe his. No mervaile if we looke for light and behold darkneſſe, for peace and behold trouble, for ſucceſſe and behold diſappointments: Whenas God lookes among us for repentance and behold preſumption, for faith and behold unbeliefe, for patience and behold complaining, for reformation and behold backſliding, for fruit and behold barrenneſſe or but leaves.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He ſaith, <hi>Let it not ſee the dawning of the day,</hi> that is, let it be quite out of hope ever to receive any light, therefore let it not ſee ſo much as a glimpſe of light. It is the ſtrongeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of the whole, to deny the leaſt or the firſt part: As when the Apoſtle would have us abſtaine from all evill, he exhorts to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from the <hi>appearance of evill,</hi> (1 Theſ. 5.) So here when <hi>Job</hi> would put his night quite out of hope to ſee a day, he ſaith, <hi>Let it not ſee</hi> (ſo much as) <hi>the dawning</hi> (that is, the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) <hi>of the day.</hi> And this as it is the laſt, ſo the heavieſt ſentence upon his night. Obſerve then, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A hopeleſſe condition is the worst condition of all other.</hi> Let a night be never ſo darke, never ſo tempeſtuous, yet the hope of a morning is a mercy and a light. A man will beare any heavineſſe, when he can ſay as <hi>David, Heavineſſe may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. Solomon</hi> tells us, that the <hi>hope deferr'd makes the heart ſicke,</hi> Prov. 13.12. How ſicke then are they who are hopeleſſe, or who have quite loſt their hope? Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſſe is the head of the arrow, the ſting and poiſon of all miſeries; it is indeed the ſting of Hell: that Hell is ſuch a night as never ſhall ſee the dawning of the day, hath more torment and paine in it then all the paines in Hell. As the puniſhment of loſſe in Hell pinches more then the puniſhment of ſenſe, ſo in the loſſe this pinches moſt that the loſſe is irrecoverable: They are deprived
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:98733:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the glory of God, and ſhall never ſee the leaſt ray of it for ever. They are in darkneſſe, and they have no hope of light at all for ever.</p>
               <p>As that which makes Heaven ſo full of joy, is, that Heaven is above all feare, ſo that which makes Hell ſo full of terrour, is, that Hell is below all hope: Heaven is a day which ſhall never ſee any approaches of the night, and Hell is a night that ſhall never ſee any dawnings of the day. So, proportionably in any affliction of this life to be hopeleſſe of deliverance, to ſay it ſhall never end, I am in ſuch a night as ſhall have no day, no not the dawning of a day, this is the utmoſt evill, the extremity of affliction.</p>
               <p>So much concerning the curſe it ſelfe which <hi>Job</hi> powred out with ſo much paſſion, both againſt the day of his birth and the night of his conception. We ſhall now here ſee the reaſon of this paſſion in the words which follow.</p>

               <p>WE are now come to the ſecond generall part of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. You may remember, the whole was divided into three Sections. The firſt ſhewed us the curſe which <hi>Job</hi> powred out upon his day. The ſecond, the cauſe or ground of that curſe. And the third, a vehement expoſtulation about the continuance of his life and the lengthning of his dayes.</p>
               <p>We have heard the curſe opened already in the nine former ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Now followeth the cauſe of the curſe. <hi>Iob</hi> gives an account or reaſon of his paſſion: If any ſhould check him with, <hi>why doeſt thou thus breath out complaints againſt the day of thy birth?
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:98733:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
why doeſt thou write ſuch bitter things against the night of thy conception?</hi> He anſwereth as <hi>David</hi> did his bretheren in another caſe, 1 Sam. 17. Why, <hi>what have I done or ſpoken, Is there not a cauſe?</hi> Or as <hi>Ionah</hi> when God reproves him about his paſſion for the withered gourd, <hi>Doeſt thou well to be angry? Ionah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, Yes, <hi>I doe well to be angry even unto death,</hi> chap. 49. So ſaith <hi>Iob</hi> here to any that ſhould rebuke him, with, doe you well to be thus angry with your day? Yes, I doe well to be angry with my day, and I ſhew you why, <hi>becauſe it ſhut not up the doores of my mothers wombe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The reaſon or the argument ſtands thus. There is cauſe I ſhould curſe that day and that night, which not hindering my concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or my birth, brought me forth upon the ſtage of the world, to act a part in all theſe ſorrowes: But the day and the night did not hinder my conception or my birth, therefore I have cauſe, I have reaſon enough to breake out in ſuch complaints and curſe them. I doe it, becauſe theſe <hi>ſhut not up the doores of my mothers wombe.</hi> This is the argument or reaſon by which he defends his paſſion: and this argument will be found to have more paſſion in it then reaſon, if we examine it to the bottome. For he complaines of that as the cauſe, which was not the cauſe of his troubles: what did the night or the day, that he thus chargeth them? They had no efficiency in bringing thoſe evills upon him, circumſtances are not cauſes; Effects are produced in time, but time doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce effects. Only this we may ſay to helpe it, he doth not curſe the day, as if it could have ſhut the doores of his mothers wombe, but becauſe on that day thoſe doores were not ſhut.</p>
               <p>But leaving the reaſon of his ſpeech, we will conſider the ſenſe of it.</p>

                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:98733:202"/>I ſhall in ſilence paſſe over that ſecret or myſtery in nature, which may be the ground of this expreſſion. There are two ſecrets in Divinity, which are the grounds of it, and of them I ſhall ſpeake.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, When God layes that affliction of barrenneſſe upon the woman, he according to the phraſe of Scripture, is ſaid to <hi>ſhut up the wombe</hi>; And when he ſendeth the bleſſing of fruitfulneſſe, he is ſaid <hi>to open the wombe.</hi> We have both, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.18. When <hi>Abimelech</hi> had taken <hi>Sarah Abrahams</hi> wife, <hi>the Lord faſt cloſed up all the wombes of the houſe of</hi> Abimelech. The meaning of it is this, he made all the women barren, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the bleſſing of conception; The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Expoſitors render the meaning in the very words of this Text, that the Lord had ſhut up all the doores of the wombes of the houſe of <hi>Abimelech.</hi> And ſo likewiſe for fruitfulneſſe, God is ſaid to open the wombe, as Gen. 29.31. <hi>And when the Lord ſaw that</hi> Leah <hi>was hated, he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her wombe, but</hi> Rachel <hi>was barren.</hi> Then, to ſhut the doores of the wombe, notes the power of God in denying, and to open thoſe doores, the bleſſing of God in giving conception and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fruitfull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may referre to the birth: for, there muſt be an opening of thoſe doores and that by an Almighty power, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction as well as for conception; And therefore <hi>David,</hi> (Pſal. 22.9.) aſcribes it to the Lord, <hi>Lord thou art he who tookeſt me out of my mothers wombe.</hi> It was not the Midwife did it, It was not the womens helpe that ſtood about his mother, <hi>but Lord thou dideſt it</hi>; The hand of God only is able to open that doore and let man into the world; Unleſſe he (as we may ſo ſpeake) turne the key, the poore infant muſt for ever lye in priſon, and make his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe his grave.</p>
               <p>In either or both theſe reſpects <hi>Job</hi> here ſpeakes againſt the night, <hi>becauſe it ſhut not up the doores of his mothers wombe,</hi> to ſtop his conception, or ſtay him in the birth: For then, either he had not been, or he had not been brought forth as the ſubject of all thoſe calamities. Hence obſerve, firſt</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That fruitfulneſſe or conception is the eſpeciall worke and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God:</hi> God carries the key of the wombe in his own hand. From him we receive <hi>life and breath,</hi> (Acts 17.25.) <hi>yea in his booke are all our members written, which in continuance were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned, when as yet there was none of them: Wee are fearefully
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:98733:203"/>
and wonderfully made, Our ſubstance is not hid from God, when we are made in ſecret, and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt parts of the earth.</hi> As the holy Ghoſt admirably and moſt elegantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the conception and formation of man in the wombe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>There are foure keyes of nature, all kept in the hand of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The key of the Raine. The clouds cannot open themſelves, the flood-gates of Heaven cannot be unlocked, nor thoſe ſluces opened to let downe a drop of raine, untill God turne the key, Deut. 28.12. <hi>The Lord ſhall open unto thee his good treaſure, the Heaven to give the raine unto thy land in his ſeaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The key of Nutrition, or of Foode, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.16. <hi>Thou openest thine hand and ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living thing.</hi> The ſtrength of the creature is ſhut up in the hand of God, and untill he unlock his hand, the creatures cannot ſtrengthen or nouriſh us, though we have our houſes and our hands full of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The key of the Grave, <hi>Eze.</hi> 37.13. <hi>I will open your graves and cauſe you to come out of your graves.</hi> We are ſo faſt lockt up in death, that all the power in the world is not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe us, till God ſpeake the word and turne the key of the graves-doore. That place in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is meant (I know) of a civill death: But it is as true of naturall death, And the argument is ſtronger for it; If when a Nation (as the nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> then did) lyes in the grave of bondage and captivity, no man can unlock that doore without the key of Gods ſpeciall providence; much leſſe can any hand or power but his, open the doore and bring us out of the grave of our corporall diſſolution.</p>
               <p>There is this fourth key belonging to the doore ſpoken of in the Text, <hi>the doore of the wombe:</hi> Which was ſhadowed in that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> of giving their <hi>firſt-borne</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> as a thankefull acknowledgement, that the beginning of all propagation and increaſe was from him. Further obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That our birth and production is the speciall worke of God. Thou art he that tookeſt me out of my mothers wombe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>) And he apprehended the power of God ſo great in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall birth, that he from thence takes an argument to ſtrengthen his faith, that God could doe any other thing for him, how hard ſoever. He knew he could never be in ſuch ſtraights, but the power of God could deliver him, when he once remembred that it was
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:98733:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God who tooke him out of his mothers womb: For in the words immediately fore-going, he bringeth in his enemies laughing at, yea reproaching him and ſaying; <hi>He trusted in God that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him, let him deliver him ſeeing he delighted in him</hi>; They jeere him with his God, <hi>let him deliver him. David</hi> anſwers, What doe ye think God cannot deliver me. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou art he that tookeſt me out of my mothers wombe.</hi> Can I ever be in ſuch ſtraights as I was then, can I ever be in a more helpleſſe condition? Can I ever be in more need of an Almighty helpe, then when I was ſtrugling to get into the world? There is more of the power of God put forth in bringing a poore infant into the world, then in bringing him out of any trouble or ſtraight he can fall into, in his travels through the world; And hence the great deliverances of a people from danger, and their reformations from errour are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a birth, as King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſpeakes in his meſſage to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 2 King. 19.4. <hi>The children are come to the birth and there is no ſtrength to bring forth.</hi> As if he had ſaid, great things are now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, but nothing can be perfected; great troubles are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but we cannot be delivered by any humane power or policy; Therefore <hi>lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left.</hi> Every new deliverance and reformation of a Church is a new-birth of that Church. <hi>Who hath heard ſuch a thing? who hath ſeene ſuch things? ſhall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or ſhall a Nation be borne at once? for aſſoone as</hi> Zion <hi>travailed, ſhee brought forth her children.</hi> That is, <hi>Sions</hi> mercies were ſpeedily and ſuddainely obtained. She uſes to have long travaile and many throes, but now the mighty power of God opened the doore of the wombe, a doore of hope, and <hi>Sion</hi> was eaſily delivered of a man-child, A glorious mercy, <hi>Iſai,</hi> 66.8. You ſee how the holy Ghoſt paralels the working of great things for the Church, to the travaile of a woman; whoſe infant ſticks in the birth, if God ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his helpe, but if he open the doore by a hand of gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, ſhe brings forth, Even <hi>before ſhe travailes,</hi> (as the ſame Prophet ſpeakes,) <hi>and before ſhe is in paine ſhe is delivered.</hi> I have adventured to lengthen out this notion ſomewhat further then that hint in the Text doth well beare, only becauſe we being a people now in ſtrong travaile, and wanting ſtrength to bring forth, may be directed to conſider whoſe hand holds the key which opens the wombe of Nations as well as perſons, and at the turning of whoſe hand, we ſhall quickly be delivered; and being delivered, we ſhall
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:98733:204"/>
quickly forget all our paines and pangs, for joy that a man-child, ſuch a maſculine bleſſing is borne into the world. But the Text goes on ſtill in teares. As followes,
<q>Nor hid ſorrow from mine eyes.</q>

                  </note>The word which we tranſlate <hi>ſorrow,</hi> ſignifies more properly labour and wearineſſe, or the wearineſſe that doth ariſe from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſo from thence it is tranſlated to ſignifie any kind of ſorrow or trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe it hid not ſorrow from mine eyes.</hi>] By the hiding of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from his eyes, he noteth only thus much, that he ſhould have been delivered from the ſenſe and experience of ſorrow. He had miſt thoſe evills which he met with, ſince his coming into the world, if thoſe doores being ſhut, had ſhut him out of the world. When ſorrow is hid from our eyes, then all evill is removed, as in that ſpeech, (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.16.) <hi>Becauſe the former troubles are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, becauſe they are hidden from mine eyes,</hi> that is, as if he had ſaid, we feare no trouble, no danger, no evill hangs over out heads, now <hi>the former evills are forgotten, they are hidden from mine eyes,</hi> As we uſe to ſay of great dangers, that they are <hi>immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers,</hi> they hang over our heads, or hang before our eyes, becauſe they lye ſo neere and are in ſuch a readineſſe to oppreſſe and fall upon us.</p>
               <p>Now when <hi>Job</hi> ſubjoyneth ſorrow to his birth, as if aſſoone as ever the doores were open for him to ſtep into the world, the firſt object he met with was trouble, and he was ſaluted by ſorrow as ſoone as ever he ſaw the light. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That man is borne to ſorrow.</hi> He ſees ſorrow the firſt thing he ſees. Sorrow is his firſt acquaintance. The connection is very cloſe, <hi>Becauſe it ſhut not up the doores of the wombe, nor hid ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from mine eyes. Eliphaz</hi> tells us, (chap. 5.7.) <hi>That man is borne unto trouble, as the ſparkes flie upward.</hi> He is born to it, the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion implies that trouble &amp; ſorrow take hold of us, or we enter upon and take hold of trouble, aſſoone as ever we enter upon the world, we are borne to them, trouble and ſorrow are a mans inheritance; as an heyre is borne to his land or eſtate. Man hath a right to thoſe troubles, they are his birth-right, and all his birth-right by nature; and aſſoone as ever he is borne, he takes poſſeſſion of ſorrow, or ſorrow poſſeſſes him. Many a man is borne to riches and a great eſtate, but he ſtayeth a great while for the poſſeſſion of them; man
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:98733:204"/>
is borne to trouble, and he enters upon that aſſoone as ever he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the world; ſorrow is not his inheritance in reverſion, but in poſſeſſion; <hi>Even as the sparkes flie upward,</hi> that explaines it to be ſo, <hi>as the ſonnes of the Coale,</hi> (ſo the Hebrew) that is, ſparkes aſſoone as ever they are borne out of the coale flie upward, and are preſently aſcending; ſo is man tending unto trouble. <hi>Few and evill have the dayes of the yeeres of my life beene,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob, (Gen.</hi> 47.9.) How few ſoever they have been, they have been evill: if his life had been but one day, that had been an evill day. If his life had not been lengthened to the leaſt number of days, yet his evills had multiplied to a number: in few houres we have many ſorrowes.</p>
               <p>Some make the infants teares a preſage of theſe ſorrowes, as if he wept to thinke upon what a ſhore of trouble he is landed: Or rather into what a Sea of ſtormes he is lanching, when he comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; ſuch ſtormes as he ſhall never be fully quit of, till he is harboured in his grave. Wherefore as the Angell ſaid unto the woman, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.5. <hi>Why ſeeke yee the living among the dead?</hi> So I may ſay to you, why ſeeke ye peace in a land of trouble, and joy in a land of ſorrow? Theſe are reſerved for us in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey which is above, expect them not here, <hi>for this is not your reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We may note from this expreſſion, <hi>Nor hid ſorrow from mine eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſight of the eye wounds the heart.</hi> He doth not ſay, and hid trouble from my ſoule, or trouble from my ſpirit, but <hi>hid ſorrow from mine eyes.</hi> It is a proverbiall ſpeech among us, <hi>What the eye ſees not, the heart grieves not.</hi> And when the Lord would ſhew how he was moved with the ſufferings and knew the ſorrowes of his people in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he doubles it upon this ſenſe, <hi>I have ſeene, I have ſeene, or I have ſurely ſeene the affliction of my people, Exod.</hi> 3.7. Your ſorrowes are not hid from mine eyes. <hi>Mine eye affects my heart,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Jeremie,</hi> Lam. 3.51. That is, mine eye afflicts my heart. While <hi>Jeremie</hi> went about the City, and ſaw ſo many wofull ſpectacles in the ruine and captivity of his people, that ſight ſmote him to the heart. It is ſaid, that when Chriſt came to <hi>Jeruſalem and beheld the City, he wept over it,</hi> Luk. 19.41. And for the ſorrow of repentance, the ſight of the eye hath a great influence upon the heart, <hi>They ſhall looke on me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourne,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.

As the eye doth affect, or rather infect the heart with ſin, from ſin-occaſioning objects; a ſin that is in the eye will be preſently at the heart, which cauſed <hi>Job</hi> to ſay, (Chap. 31.1.) <hi>I made a covenant with mine eyes, why then ſhould I thinke upon a maide?</hi> He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, ſinfully to luſt after her; as if he had ſaid, there is a quick, a ſpeedy paſſage from the eye to the heart, though in the fabrick of the body there ſeemes a great diſtance betweene them: Therefore I have made a covenant with my eyes to avoide occaſions of ſin, leaſt mine eyes ſhould pollute my heart with motions unto ſin. And as it is in pleaſure-provoking objects, that which is a pleaſure to the eye, will preſently be a pleaſure to the heart, a refreſhing to our ſpirits: And that pleaſure which ſhall laſt for evermore in Heaven, is from a viſion that ſhall laſt for ever. Joy ſhall for ever be before the eye, and therefore joy ſhall for ever fill the heart. The joy of Heaven conſiſts in viſion, in ſeeing God <hi>as he is,</hi> (1 Joh. 3.2.) or in ſeeing <hi>face to face,</hi> (1 Cor. 13.12.) which is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion beatificall. So likewiſe there is an afflicting viſion. The eye affects the heart with ſorrow-occaſioning objects, if ſorrow be in the eye, it will not ſtay long from the heart. Hence when <hi>Sarah-Abrahams</hi> wife was dead, <hi>Abraham</hi> thus beſpeakes the people among whom he dwelt, <hi>If it be your mind that I ſhould bury my dead out of my ſight,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 23.8.) It did afflict the heart of <hi>Abraham</hi> with ſorrow, to ſee the body of his deceaſed wife, or the coffin wherein ſhe lay, whom he had ſo entirely loved, therefore <hi>bury her out of my ſight.</hi> It is very obſervable, that when <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> would doe ſomewhat purpoſely to afflict and touch the heart of his bretheren with more remorſe for their former unkindneſſe unto him, the hiſtory ſaith, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 42.24) <hi>that hee tooke from them</hi> Simeon, <hi>and bound him before their eyes</hi>; He heard them in their private conference, whiſper one to another, <hi>We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoule, when he beſought us, and we would not heare, therefore is this diſtreſſe come upon us.</hi> When <hi>Joſeph</hi> perceived their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences began thus to worke, he reſolves to give them a <hi>pill at their eyes,</hi> (even a dolefull ſpectacle, yet the lively picture of their dealing with him) to make their conſciences worke faſter, with godly ſorrow: <hi>He tooke from them</hi> Simeon, <hi>and bound him before their eyes.</hi> And <hi>Judah</hi> when he pleadeth afterward, <hi>chap.</hi> 44. for the carrying back of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> you know what a patheticall oration he makes; O, ſaith he, doe not detaine <hi>Benjamin,</hi> for

The Lord threatens his people thus in caſe of diſobedience, Deut. 28.31. <hi>Thine Oxe ſhall be ſlaine before thine eyes, thine Aſſe ſhall be violently taken away from before thy face. Thy ſonnes and thy daughters ſhall be given to another people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that thou ſhalt be mad for the ſight of thine eyes which thou ſhalt ſee,</hi> ver. 34. and <hi>ver.</hi> 67. he ſhewes what convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and diviſions of ſpirit, the viſions of the eye would bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. <hi>In the morning thou ſhalt ſay, would God it were Even, and at Even thou ſhalt ſay would God it were morning, for the feare of thine heart wherewith thou ſhalt feare, and for the ſight of thine eyes which thou ſhalt ſee.</hi> The feare of the heart and the ſight of the eye are neerely joyned. The ſight of the eye cauſed the feare of the heart, and both were as concauſes of thoſe diſtracting thoughts and wiſhes of haſtening the morning to the evening, and againe ſuddenly reducing back the evening to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Unleſſe ſorrow be hid from the eyes, it can hardly be kept from the heart. It is an uſuall cuſtome if a man be but let blood, to bid him turne away his head if he be faint-hearted, for the ſight of his blood will make his heart faint; And ſo from more gaſtly ſpectacles, men commonly turne away their faces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is to hide ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from their eyes. It followes,

                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.46. Where it is ſaid, <hi>that Chriſt gave up the ghoſt.</hi> The word is conceived to note a willing cheerefull reſignation of our ſelves in death, a dying without much reluctance or reſiſtance, a being active in death rather then paſſive, we call it well a giving up the ghoſt. Some apply it only to the death of the godly, (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.8. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> &amp;c.) whoſe lives are not violently ſnatcht from them, but willingly ſurrendred. When a godly man dyes a violent death, he doth not dye violently: Whereas a wicked man dies violently, when he dies naturally: and though ſometimes (being weary of his life, or deſpairing of reliefe) he drives out his ghoſt, yet in a ſtrict ſenſe he never gives up the ghoſt. It is ſaid to the wicked rich man in the Goſpell, (Luk. 12.20.) <hi>Thou foole, this night ſhall thy ſoule be required of thee,</hi> demanded indeed, but O how unwillingly doth the rich man pay this naturall debt, who is ſo able to pay all civill debts. Yet it muſt be confeſt that we find the word often uſed promiſcuouſly, applied as well to the death of the wicked as of the godly; To <hi>Iſmael, (Gen.</hi> 25.8.) as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> Acts 5.10. Yea it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the death of any or all living things, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.21. <hi>And all fleſh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowle, and of cattell; and of beaſts, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then againe, If I had not ſo much favour to die aſſoone as ever I came from the wombe, or to die in the very birth; yet, <hi>Why did the knees prevent me? or the breaſts that I ſhould ſucke?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are two ſteps aggravating the cauſe of his curſe againſt his day. If I had not been borne dead ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> or died naturally
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:98733:206"/>
aſſoone as I was borne, yet why was I not left to periſh? I ſhould have died quickly, if they had let me alone, though I were born alive into the world; that is the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>Why did the knees prevent me?</hi> why was there any care taken of me? why did the Midwife and the Aſſiſtant women take me upon their knees? why did they waſh me, ſwathe me and bind me up? If they had not been ſo kind, it had been a kindneſſe unto me, if they had ſpared their labour, they had done me a favour; If they had omitted their care, how many cares had I eſcaped?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why did the knees prevent me? or</hi> (which is a further ſtep and the fift ſtep by which this ſpeech aſcends) <hi>why the breſts that I ſhould ſuck?</hi> As if he had ſaid, If they would needs be ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as to take me up upon the knee, to waſh me, to binde me up and cloath me, yet why was the breſt preſented to me? why was I layed to the breſt? If they had kept me from ſucking the breſt, I ſhould have ſuckt but little breath; I had died quickly.</p>
               <p>So that in theſe words there are five gradations by which <hi>Job</hi> aggravateth the cauſe of this curſe againſt his day. Firſt, Becauſe he was conceived. Secondly, Becauſe the doore was opened for him to be borne. Thirdly, Becauſe being borne, he did not preſently give up the ghoſt, or die aſſoone as he came into the world. Fourthly, Becauſe there was ſo much care taken for him, as to take him upon the knee, and bind him up. Fifthly, Becauſe there was a breſt provided, and papps for him to ſucke: If any of theſe latter acts had been neglected, <hi>Job</hi> had died, and ſo eſcaped all theſe enſuing troubles of his life, <hi>ſorrow had been hidden from his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is obſerved (eſpecially in theſe latter acts of this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation) that <hi>Job</hi> alludes to the cuſtome of thoſe times, wherein unnaturall women left their children upon the cold earth, naked and helpleſſe, aſſoone as they were borne: or caſting them out, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to miſery, or the caſuall nurſery of nature lent them by beaſts, more mercifull then thoſe beaſtly mothers, who would not afford them knees to prevent, nor breſts to give them ſuck. As in that place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.4, 5. the wofull condition of ſuch an infant is expreſt, to ſhadow out the ſinfully polluted and woefuly helpleſſe eſtate of that people, and of all people by nature, till the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents them by the <hi>knees of free grace,</hi> and <hi>ſuckles them with the breſts of his conſolation. Thy father was an</hi> Amorite, <hi>and thy mother an</hi> Hittite, (of a barbarous people, and what then?) <hi>In the day thou waſt borne, thy navell was not cut, neither waſt thou

                  </note> The Heathen <hi>Romanes</hi> had a ſpeciall goddeſſe or deity, whoſe name imported her care and office, that children when they were borne, ſhould be taken up from the earth and ſet upon the knee. And for the preventing of this unnaturall cruelty, (very frequent as it ſeemes amongſt them) the <hi>Thebanes</hi> made an expreſſe law, that infants ſhould not be neglected or caſt out when they were borne, though the parents thought they would be a burden to them by reaſon of the charge, or no delight to them by reaſon of their deformity.</p>
               <p>Now ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> I could wiſh, I had had ſuch a father or ſuch a mother, or ſuch friends, who forgetting naturall affection, would have caſt me out when I came firſt into the world; <hi>Why did the knees prevent me?</hi> From hence alſo we may obſerve, firſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That an infant, aſſoone as he liveth, hath in him the ſeeds of death:</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes of himſelfe, <hi>Why died I not from the wombe? why did I not give up the ghoſt when I came out of my mothers belly?</hi> Or why was I not ſtifled in the wombe? why was ever that doore opened to let me into the world? I could have died as ſoone as I lived. Not only is man acting ſin, but nature infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with ſin, the ſubject of, and ſubjected to the power of death: So the Apoſtle teacheth us, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14.) <hi>Death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes, <hi>even over them that had not ſinned after the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of</hi> Adams <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi>; And who were thoſe? Even little infants, they had life, yet death reigned over them, they were under the dominion of death, and ſubject to that king of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Sin is the ſeed of death, and the principle of corruption. God doth infants no wrong when they die, their death is of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for they have the ſeed of death in them; We may affirme in one ſenſe, that when infants die, they have no loſſe; and we are ſure (in every ſenſe) when they die, they have no wrong; <hi>All death</hi> (except death to ſin) <hi>is the wages of ſin, and therefore can be no injury to the ſinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:98733:207"/>Secondly, We may obſerve concerning man in his birth, what a helpleſſe creature man is. If I (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) had been left a little, I had bin gone quickly, there had been an end of me: I could not have helped my ſelfe, if the knees had not prevented me, if the breſts had not given me ſuck, if I had been deſtitute of theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, then preſently <hi>I ſhould have been free among the dead, I ſhould have been quiet and gone into ſilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That every step of life ſtands in need of a step of mercy.</hi> When the infant is conceived, there muſt be an act of mercy to quicken it, an act of mercy to nouriſh it in the wombe; an act of mercy for the birth, an act of mercy being borne to take it upon the knee, an act of mercy to binde it up, an act of mercy to give it ſuck. The beginning of our lives, and the progreſſe of our lives, our generation and our preſervation call for acts of mercy, or elſe (poore creatures as we are,) we quickly periſh and returne unto our duſt. We owe our lives to God at firſt, and we owe them every moment; if he did not renew mercy every moment, we could not continue life one moment: As it is with our ſpirituall life, ſo it is with our naturall, <hi>Our lives are hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.3. Of and from our ſelves we cannot ſubſiſt, either in grace or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It followes,
<q>For now ſhould I have lien ſtill, and been quiet, I ſhould have ſlept; then had I been at reſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words are an inlargement of the former reaſon, taken from a deſcription of the ſtate and condition of the dead; <hi>For now</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) I ſhould have lien ſtill,</hi> If you ſhould aske me a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my former reaſon, why I was ſo angry with that day or night wherein I was conceived and borne, wherein I had that (to me unacceptable) mercy to be preſerved and kept alive? This I ſubjoyne for the reaſon of it, If none of thoſe unwelcome favours or naturall rights had been done me, then, <hi>I had lien ſtill, I had been quiet, I ſhould have ſlept, I had been at reſt,</hi> Either I ſhould have been as one that never was, or I ſhould have been at reſt and quiet. The argument lyes thus; Reſt and quiet are deſireable things, but death, in the omiſſion of thoſe ſuccours, would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me reſt, therefore I deſire thoſe ſuccours had been omitted. This concluſion is in the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, verſes, which we heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The aſſumption is in this 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, verſe, which he further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:98733:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the 6 verſes following, by an argument which we may thus forme. I will prove, ſaith he, that in death I ſhould have reſt and been quiet, and lien ſtill, for all conditions and ſorts of men are quiet and lie ſtill in death. There (or in that eſtate) where all degrees and ſorts of perſons are at reſt, there ſure I ſhould have found reſt; but in death all ſorts and degrees of perſons have found reſt, therefore I ſhould have found reſt too.</p>
               <p>Now that all ſorts of people lie ſtill and are at reſt in death, he proves by an elegant enumeration of the ſeverall ſorts and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men. He makes an argument by way of induction of all or moſt of the rankes of men. Firſt, He ſhewes it in <hi>Kings and Counſellours of the earth,</hi> theſe men that make ſuch a buſſell in the world, when once they are dead, they are quiet enough. And then he ſhews it in <hi>Rich-men and Princes, who load themſelves with thick clay,</hi> who toile and moile all their days to heape up and amaſſe much wealth; when theſe come to the grave, ther's an end of all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, then they muſt give over all their purſuite of riches. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He ſhewes it in children, either abortives, borne before natures time, or borne in full perfection of nature. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Laſtly, He ſhewes it in <hi>oppreſſors and the oppreſſed; in priſoners and thoſe that impriſon them; in the ſmall and in the great, in the ſervants and in their Maſters</hi>; Thus making an innumeration of all theſe, from thence he infers; That if all theſe are quiet, when they are in the grave, then ſurely his condition had been ſo too; <hi>I ſhould have been quiet and lien still, then I ſhould have ſlept and been at rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt here take notice, that <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking of the ſtate of death, ſpeakes only in reference to an outward condition, and our reſting from outward calamities and troubles; he doth not handle the point at all concerning mans eternall eſtate; For, death is not reſt to all ſorts of men in that ſenſe: Kings and Counſellours, and rich men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may reſt from the troubles of this world, and goe to a world of everlaſting troubles. Such a totall reſt is the ſole privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Saints.

               <p>Having thus, foure words concurring in the ſame ſenſe, we may here not unprofitably take notice of that elegant multiplication of words in the holy Scriptures. There, ſtore is no ſoare, and variety is no ſuperfluity, yea there Tautologie is no ſuperfluity: It is the uſuall rhetorick of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to ſpeake the ſame thing in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers words, yea ſometime in the ſame words; We find ſuch a congeries or heaping up of words uſed for the moſt part in ſome heate of paſſion, or vehemency of ſpirit; As firſt, when God would expreſſe a great deale of anger and wrath againſt a people, he ſpeakes thus, (Iſa. 14.22, 23.) <hi>I will riſe up againſt them, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes, and cut off from</hi> Babylon <hi>the name and rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſonne and nephew, I will alſo make it a poſſeſſion for the Bittern and pooles of water, and I will ſweepe it with the beſome of deſtruction.</hi> Here are a multitude of words, and all tending to the ſame purpoſe, ſetting forth the fierceneſſe of Gods anger, and the reſolvedneſſe of his judgement for the ruining of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The towring confuſed pride of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is preſented to us in ſuch a heape of words, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.13, 14.) heare the pure language of pride from that Kings heart; <hi>Thou hast ſaid in thine heart, I will aſcend into Heaven, I will exalt my throne above the Starres of God, I will ſit alſo upon the mount of the Congregation, I will aſcend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the most High.</hi> The manifold apoſtacies and backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of <hi>Judah,</hi> are deſcribed in many words by the Prophet <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanie,</hi> chap. 1.6. <hi>And them that are turned bank from the Lord, and thoſe that have not ſought the Lord, nor enquired for him</hi>; (Chap. 3.2.) <hi>She obeyed not the voice, ſhe received not corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſhe truſted not in the Lord, ſhe drew not neere to her God.</hi> When our Lord Chriſt would ſhew the extreame ignorance and darkneſſe of his Diſciples, in thoſe great Articles of his ſufferings, death and reſurrection, having taken the twelve unto him, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of thoſe points, he concludes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.31, 34. <hi>And they underſtood none of theſe things, and this ſaying was hid from them, neither knew they the things that were ſpoken.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, their ignorance in theſe myſteries was ſo great, that they had not the leaſt glimpſe or glimmerings of light about them.

of the grave. As if he had ſaid; Had I died then, not only had not theſe ſtormes been upon me, nor theſe waves gone over me, but the leaſt breath of wind had never blowne upon me. Hence we may obſerve, Firſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in regard of all outward troubles, death is the reſt of man. Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours</hi> And they who die out of the Lord, reſt from all that labour they have had in this world. <hi>There is no worke, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſedome in the grave whither thou goest, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. This life is a day of working, and death is a night of reſting. <hi>The Sunne ariſeth, man goeth forth to his labour untill the evening,</hi> Pſal. 104.23. When the Sunne of our life ariſeth, we goe forth to our labour, untill the evening of death. This life is a continued motion, death is a continued reſt. This life is but noiſe and tumult, death is ſilence. Our life is a ſtormy paſſage, a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous ſea-voyage, death bringeth us to the harbour.</p>
               <p>There is a foure-fold reſt which we obtaine in death. Firſt, A reſt from labour and travaile, no working there. Secondly, There is a reſt from trouble and oppreſſion, no warres, no bloody bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels there. Thirdly, There is a reſt from paſſion, no ſorrow, no griefe ſhall afflict us there. In the grave there is a fourth reſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all theſe, a reſt from ſin, a reſt from the drudgerie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, a reſt from the winnowings and buffetings of Satan; a reſt from the law of our members, warring againſt the law of our minds. When <hi>Saul</hi> went to the witch of <hi>Endor</hi> for adviſe with <hi>Samuel,</hi> that <hi>Samuel,</hi> or the Devill in the appearance of <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſpeakes as one diſturb'd being raiſed from the grave; <hi>Why,</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>haſt thou diſquieted me to bring me up,</hi> 1 Sam. 28.15.

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:98733:210"/>
that Chriſt did not weepe over <hi>Lazarus</hi> becauſe he was dead,<note place="margin">

               <p>Some of the Ancients were of opinion that this ſleepe tooke hold of and ſeaz'd upon all man, namely upon his ſoule as well as upon his body; Aſſerting that the ſoule is in a ſleepe or ſlumber, that is, that the ſoule from the time of its diſunion from the body untill the reſurrection, lyes ſtill without any motion or operation. I giant that many operations of the ſoule doe ceaſe when it parteth from the body. There are ſome acts of the ſoule which are organicall, and there are other acts that are inorganicall or immateriall: The organicall acts, that is, whatſoever the ſoule acts by the members of the body, thoſe acts I ſay muſt needs ceaſe; but the ſoule can act of it ſelfe without the aſſiſtance of the body; as we may collect by many experiments while our bodies and ſoules are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. How often doe we find our ſoules at worke, when our bodies lie ſtill and doe nothing; when ſleepe binds up all our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſhuts up the windowes of the body ſo cloſe, that we can neither heare nor ſee: yet then the ſoule frames to it ſelfe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds a thouſand various ſhapes, and heares all ſorts of ſounds and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:98733:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
voices, then the ſoule ſees, and the ſoule heares, the ſoule deviſeth, and the ſoule diſcourſeth, the ſoule greeves, and the ſoule rejoyceth, the ſoule hopes, and the ſoule feares, the ſoule electeth, and the ſoule refuſeth: All this the ſoule doth in dreames and viſions of the night, when deepe ſleepe falls upon man. So alſo in extaſies and raviſhments, the body is as it were laid by, as uſeleſſe and uninſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to the ſoule. <hi>I knew a man in Chriſt about fourteene yeares agoe,</hi> (ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,) <hi>whether in the body, I cannot tell, or out of the body, I cannot tell, God knoweth,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.2. As if he had ſaid, I was loſt as to my body, I could not tell what I was, I did not feele my ſelfe; yet he had mighty opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his ſoule, his ſpirit wrought ſtrangely, and then tooke in ſuch revelations of God and from God, as his bodily organs could never faſhion into words, or repreſent by ſpeech: He heard <note n="*" place="margin">

Beza.</note> lawfull (or poſſible) for man to utter. The ſoule hath an eare to heare ſuch words as the body cannot find a tongue to expreſſe. So the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine raviſhments, <hi>I was in the Spirit upon the Lords day.</hi> As for his body, that was, as to that buſineſſe laid by and ſuſpended as uſeleſſe in that day; and his ſpirit called up to that angelicall worke, the receiving of viſions and revelations from on high. And among other things which <hi>John</hi> ſaw, <hi>he ſaw under the Altar the ſoules of them that had beene ſlaine, for the word of God and for the teſtimony which they held</hi>; Theſe ſoules were not aſleepe though their bodies were, for <hi>they cried with a loud voice ſaying, How long, O Lord Holy and true, doeſt thou not judge and avenge our blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10. From all theſe texts and experiences we may conclude, that the ſoule wakes while the body ſleepes that ſleepe of death. And the death of the body is called a ſleepe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe as ſleepe, ſo death brings the body to reſt, as was obſerved in the former point.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Naturall ſleepe is not perpetuall, we ſleepe and wake againe; ſo though the body lye in the grave, yet death is but a ſleepe, the man ſhall awake and riſe againe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As a body aſleepe can eaſily be awaked and called up by the power of man; ſo the body when it is dead, can with infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more eaſe be raiſed by the power of God; It is but a call from Heaven and we awaken out of the duſt. God can beyound all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon more eaſily awaken us from that dead ſleepe of death, then we can awaken one another from the lighteſt ſlumber.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:98733:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>There are two queſtions which I ſhall propound and endeavour to reſolve upon the whole matter of this context.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We find <hi>Job</hi> complaining, becauſe things were not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ordered about him, he is troubled, becauſe he was borne, or becauſe he was not caſt away in the birth; for then it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him, he had beene aſleepe and quiet; he was troubled things were with him as they were. Hence it may be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Whether it be lawfull for us to wiſh or to deſire, that had not come to paſſe, which we ſee come to paſſe</hi>? And are we not bound to reſt ſatisfied with the preſent and fore-paſt diſpenſations of God, and ſo be content with the things that are, or with things as they are?</p>
               <p>For this, I ſay in generall, ſuch wiſhes or deſires are not ſinfull. It is not abſolutely ſinfull, to wiſh that not to be, which is; Nay ſome things which are, ought to be wiſhed they had not bin, and it is a ſin not to wiſh, they had not been. As thoſe things that are diſpleaſing to God, provocations to the eyes of his glory; things that are diſhonourable to God, we ought to wiſh that ſuch things had never been. God himſelfe wiſheth in that manner, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.13. <hi>O that my people had hearkned unto me, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>had walked in my wayes!</hi> They did not walke in his wayes, he wiſheth they had, he deſireth they had been better, more holy and more obedient then they were. To wiſh that a thing had not been, out of a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that God ſhould be offended by ſin, is not only lawfull, but very commendable. But to wiſh things otherwiſe then they are, as murmuring againſt and miſliking Gods adminiſtration, or out of a tenderneſſe, becauſe we ſuffer, is not only ſinfull but abominable; When our wills riſe up againſt the will of God, when we cannot be contented to be what God will have us to be, and to ſuffer what God would have us ſuffer, when we who ſhould learne to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in every eſtate, are angry with our eſtates, and on that ground wiſh, O that this had never been, O that I had never ſeene this day, becauſe it hath ſo much trouble in it; this wiſh hath I know not how much evill in it. So likewiſe when man ſhall (as it were) take upon him to direct the Almighty and only wiſe God in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the world, ſecretly ſurmizing, or openly complaining, that things might be diſpenced and manag'd with more wiſedome, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and moderation; ſuch boldneſſe is plaine blaſphemie. Some are ready to ſay in their hearts about the Lord Chriſts governing the world, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> did concerning his father <hi>Davids</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:98733:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; Things are carried, <hi>as if there were none deputed to heare</hi> or redreſſe the wrongs of men. <hi>O that I were made Judge of the world, that every man which hath any ſuite or cauſe might come to me, and I would doe him juſtice:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.3, 4.</note> Things ſhould not goe thus if I had the ordering of them; ſuch boldneſſe is higheſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. And yet with caution of due reverence to the Name of God, he gives us leave to debate the matter with him, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſtate of things in publike, and our own perſonall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
               <p>Firſt thus, If we, while we are debating, adore his ſecret Juſtice and uſearcheable wiſedome, in that which we neither ſee nor are able to underſtand. Thus while the Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> tooke liberty to pleade with God about the adminiſtrations of the world, he humbly praemiſes, <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord when I pleade with thee, yet let me talke with thee of thy judgements,</hi>

The bounds and rules may be ſuch as theſe. Firſt, Deale not too much with the creature, either in complaining of the creature, or in complaining to the creature. Let ſecond cauſes paſſe, or looke upon them but in the ſecond place: powre your complaints into the boſome of God. Secondly, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider from whence your bewailings move; take heed they ſpring not from delicacie of ſpirit, or an unwillingneſſe to lie under the croſſe, becauſe it ſpoiles your <hi>faire ſhew in the fleſh:</hi>

The Apoſtles ſpirit was raiſed to this heroick pitch, and ſomewhat above it, when he ſaid, <hi>I rejoyce in my ſufferings,</hi> Col. 1.24. (Joy is a degree beyond love) when he ſaid, <hi>I take pleaſure in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Christs ſake,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. (Pleaſure is a degree beyond joy.) But eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when he ſaid, <hi>I glory in tribulations,</hi> Rom. 5.3. <hi>And God forbid that I ſhould glory</hi> (in any thing elſe) <hi>ſave in the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.14. To glory in a thing is more then to take pleaſure in it. Againe, Take heed your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and bewailings doe not ariſe out of diſtruſt and unbeliefe; ſuch complainings are provocations. It was called <hi>the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made ſuch diſtruſting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.8. <hi>Harden not your hearts as in the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the day of temptation in the wilderneſſe.</hi> And that the provocation lay in their unbeleefe, the Apoſtle is expreſſe, <hi>Heb,</hi> 3. where quoting this text of the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> he concludes his whole diſcourſe thus, ver. 19. <hi>So we ſee they could not enter in becauſe of unbeliefe.</hi> If we mixe faith with our teares, and while we bemoane our condition, yet beleeve, that God is good and good to us, that God is alſufficient, and alſufficient to deliver us; we may wiſh that the things that are, were not, and that God who chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not, would make a change in our eſtate,</p>
               <p>For the cloſe of this point, I ſhall lay downe theſe three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,</p>
               <p>Firſt, A man may deſire that, which God wills not, and not ſinne in that deſire: As the deliverance of a people whom God will deſtroy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A man may ſin in deſiring that which God wills: When it is the will of God that the father ſhall die; the child ſins in deſiring it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A man may without ſin deſire that not to be, which God wills; or which is the ſame, that not to be which is; ſuch deſires being qualified according to the cautions before given.</p>
               <p>There is a ſecond queſtion ariſing upon a part of this complaint: For <hi>Job</hi> complaines not only of his troubles, but of his life: And ſeemes to have been angry with his very being; while he wiſhes he had never been conceived, or that his mother had been denied the bleſſing of conception. The queſtion then is, <hi>Whether an evill or a troubleſome being be worſe then no being? Or whether it be better not to be then to be miſerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:98733:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>I anſwer, There is a two-fold miſerable being, one Temporall, the other Eternall. An eternall miſerable being is eternally worſe then a not being. But a temporall miſerable being, at the worſt, is better then a not being. And the reaſon is, becauſe our being is farre more excellent then the outward comforts of our being, theſe being only accidentall to our being; and therefore it neceſſarily followes, that it is better to be without outward comforts, then to be without a being. Againe, Life is better then all outward things, (Satan ſpake truly in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>All that a man hath will he give for his life.</hi>) That which a man parts with rather then his life, is below his life. If then life be better then riches, or health, or pleaſures, then much more is our being better then all theſe. As a man may hold his life when all his eſtate and comforts are gone, ſo he doth hold his being when his life is gone; Life is brittle ware at the beſt, but mans being is of an <hi>everlaſting make.</hi> I know there are ſome who diſpute and conclude, that a being, even an eternally miſerable being is better then no being: And I grant it is ſo in a metaphyſicall or a philoſophicall notion, but in a theologicall notion it is not. A Philoſopher (keeping within the ſpheare of nature) can ſee no miſery ſo miſerable, or evill ſo bad, as not to be.<note place="margin">

Not to be borne, is in this place, as much as not to be. And it had been good for him not to have beene borne, is as much as to ſay, it had been better for him not to have beene borne. It had been better for him not to have been, then to have committed ſuch a ſin, to lie under ſuch wrath, and to looſe ſuch happineſſe for ever.

               <p>Now to ſhut up and reſolve the queſtion, as to the ground of it, <hi>Jobs</hi> complaint in this Text, I ſay, <hi>Job</hi> was only in the preſent feeling of temporall troubles, and he was beyond the feare of eternall: Therefore number this among his failings, that he wiſht he had never been conceived, becauſe he was thus afflicted.</p>

               <p>And the word which we have here <hi>for deſolate places,</hi> is in Scripture clearely applied to the grave, or a place of buriall. We have it in, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.20. where the Prophet foreſhewing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Tyre,</hi> ſpeakes from the Lord, thus, <hi>When I ſhall bring thee downe with them that deſcend into the pit, and ſhall ſet thee in the low parts of the earth, in places deſolate of old.</hi> There are three words in that verſe, and they are all <hi>Synonima's,</hi> words of the ſame ſignification; Firſt, <hi>The pit.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The low parts of the earth.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>The deſolate places</hi>; and all theſe are but ſeverall expreſſions for the grave, or for a place to bury in, It is no more but this, <hi>When I ſhall bring thee downe, even with thoſe that lie buried in the grave.</hi> So that the word which we tranſlate
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:98733:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>deſolate places,</hi> being alſo in other places uſed for the grave or a place of buriall, we may very well expound it ſo here, that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate places</hi> are the graves or ſepulchers of <hi>Kings, and Princes, and Counſellours of the earth</hi>; which we may doe eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Job</hi> treats in this place about death, and the ſtate of the dead.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Tombes and Monuments</hi> may be called <hi>deſolate places</hi> in two reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe when the body is layed in there, all company and all friends leave it; you ſhall have a mighty traine following their friend to the grave, but there they leave him. <hi>Kings and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours</hi> have ſtately Funerals, but when their ſubjects or friends, favourites or flatterers have brought them to the tombe and opened the doore of the grave, they goe no further, they will not goe in with them, and dwell with their bodies in the duſt of death, as much as they honour'd or ador'd them when they lived: ſo that, they are in <hi>deſolate places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Graves may be called <hi>deſolate places,</hi> becauſe Tombes and Sepulchres were in deſolate places, they were made in ſome high Mountaine or caved Valley, in ſome place remote from the company and habitations of the living; for in former times they did not bury in Cities or in Townes, but in places where few came, till they were carried, and therefore properly called <hi>deſolate pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eutrop. <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>In <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbe ne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelito neve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> It is obſerved, that among the <hi>Romans,</hi> the firſt Emperour that was buried in <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Traian.</hi> And the law of the <hi>twelve Tables</hi> did prohibit both the buriall and the burning of the dead within the City. So then it is cleare, that anciently Tombes and Monuments were erected in deſolate places, and that great coſt was beſtowed in building and beautifying of them; both which favour and illuſtrate the expoſition given. It followes in the Text;

                  </note>The word <hi>Sar,</hi> a Prince, in the Hebrew as in moſt other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, ſignifies <hi>the chiefe, the head, the firſt</hi>; Some Criticks conceive that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> word [<hi>Sir</hi>] comes from it, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neere in ſound, and ſo is the <hi>French</hi> word [<hi>Mounſier</hi>] to this Originall for a Prince or Chiefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> deſcribeth Princes thus, <hi>they are ſuch as had gold,</hi> noting both what the ſtudy and indeavours of Princes are, namely, to lay
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:98733:215"/>
up gold; and likewiſe what is requiſite for them. Gold is of great uſe in a high eſtate; Treaſures are neceſſary for Princes. <hi>Princes that had gold.</hi> Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> that wiſe Prince ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Eccleſ,</hi> 2.8. And he putteth it among his Princely workes, <hi>I gathered me alſo ſilver and gold, and the peculiar treaſure of Kings:</hi> When the <hi>Wiſe-men</hi> came to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the firſt thing they offered him was <hi>gold,</hi> and they did <hi>wiſely,</hi> for he was a <hi>Prince</hi>: gold being the chiefe, and as it were the prince of Mettals, is a very proper offering for Princes. And howſoever wiſedome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, juſtice and clemency are farre more neceſſary requiſites in Princes then gold, yet there is ſuch a neceſſary conjunction of theſe two, that we find him in the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.7.) refuſing the governement becauſe he was poore. <hi>Be thou our Ruler</hi> (ſay they verſ. 6.) <hi>and let this ruine be under thine hand,</hi> that is, be thou our Prince and take charge of us; Not I ſaith he, <hi>I will not be an healer, for in mine houſe is neither bread nor cloathing, make me not a Ruler of the people</hi>; As if he had ſaid, I am but a poore man, a man of a weake eſtate, Princes muſt have treaſure and great eſtates to beare up the dignity of their places; As covetouſneſſe, ſo poverty is very unbecoming in a Prince. The <hi>Romane</hi> ſtory tells us, that when two great Conſulls ſtood in competition for a great employment in the affaires of that Common-wealth, One of the Senators being as'kt upon which of the two he would beſtow his vote, Anſwered, upon neither: And gives this reaſon,<note place="margin">Valerius: Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>One hath nothing, and the other can never have enough</hi>; One was ſo poore that he had nothing to ſupport him, and the other was ſo covetous that nothing would ſatisfie him. Therefore, as before <hi>Job</hi> joyned Counſellours with Kings, ſo here he joyneth gold with Princes; <hi>The next expedient for Princes to counſell and wiſedome, are gold and treaſures.</hi> We find indeed, that God gives it in charge to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> concerning their gathering of treaſures, that they ſhould not be exceſſive, (<hi>Deut:</hi> 17.17.) <hi>Neither ſhall he greatly multiply to himſelfe ſilver and gold,</hi> He doth not ſay, your Prince or your King ſhall not multiply ſilver or gold, but <hi>he ſhall not greatly multiply ſilver or gold,</hi> that is, he ſhall not ſet his heart upon them, or thinke he never hath enough, he ſhall not greatly doe it,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>ſilver,</hi> The root from which it ſprings, ſignifieth <hi>to deſire,</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe treaſure, ſilver or gold, are ſuch deſireable things, or things upon which the deſires of moſt men are ſet: therefore the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> give ſilver a name proper to its own nature, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the nature of men, whoſe deſires are enflamed after it. With this deſireable thing, <hi>Princes fill their houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What are theſe houſes?</p>
               <p>A houſe is a place wherein man liveth, or inhabiteth while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth: this is the ordinary acception of the word; and ſo it may be taken here, for the ordinary dwelling houſes or Pallaces of Princes; And then it is an heightning of the ſenſe, <hi>They had gold,</hi> yea, they had ſo much, as they <hi>filled their houſes with it.</hi>

               <p>Then againe, (That we may keepe in this clauſe to the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given in the laſt, of the <hi>deſolate places,</hi>) we may underſtand by the houſes that theſe Princes filled with treaſure, the <hi>graves,</hi> the <hi>Tombes</hi> wherein they were buried; And it is the language of Scripture, to call the grave a houſe, mans houſe. Two Texts I will give you for it, one out of this booke, <hi>Job</hi> 30.23. where <hi>Job</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the grave, calleth it <hi>the houſe appointed for all living</hi>; And <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.5. where <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it our <hi>long home, Man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>

                  <hi>and goeth to his long home</hi>; the word in the Originall is, he goeth to the houſe of his age, or to the houſe of age. God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>rock of ages,</hi> becauſe he is an <hi>everlaſting ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 26.4. The grave is called an houſe of age, becauſe it is a very laſting houſe, an abiding houſe, a houſe where man muſt abide till God ſound him up by the voice of a <hi>Trumpet</hi> to the reſurrection; So then the grave is likewiſe called an houſe, the <hi>houſe of all living,</hi> becauſe thither every one that is living is travailing, man travailes to the grave as to his houſe; And <hi>a long-home,</hi> in oppoſition to our <hi>ſhort home,</hi> our uncertaine abode in thoſe houſes wherein we dwell upon the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Princes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) that had gold,</hi> and this is one uſe they make of it, <hi>they fill their houſes,</hi> that is, their graves or their tombes with this treaſure. In thoſe times (it ſeemes) they did not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow great coſt upon their Tombes and places of buriall, but they put great ſtore of treaſure into the Tombes with them. According to this interpretation, the meaning of <hi>Job</hi> may be thus repreſented, <hi>If I had died before,</hi> and had been buried poorely and obſcurely, <hi>yet I ſhould have done as well as Kings and Counſellours, who with vaſt expence of treaſure build ſtately Tombes for themſelves, yea

as well as Princes that put their treaſure into their Tombes with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it was a cuſtome to put in much treaſure into Tombes, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. book of Antiquities and 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.<note place="margin">Ioſeph. <hi>l.</hi> 13. <hi>Antiq. c.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> l. 16. c. 11.</note> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhewing how <hi>Hircanus</hi> opened <hi>Davids</hi> Sepulcher, and tooke out three thouſand Talents; And in his 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. booke, chap. 11. he notes, that afterward <hi>Herod</hi> opened the Sepulchre of <hi>David,</hi> and thought to have found a great deale of treaſure there, but found only ſome precious garments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the ſtory is famous out of <hi>Herodotus</hi> concerning <hi>Semiramis,</hi>

Or this might be as a juſt puniſhment of that grredineſſe after gaine, ſo eminent in the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that the Prophet in the very Chapter where this is threatned, chargeth them thus, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Every one from the leaſt to the greatest, is given to covetouſneſſe.</hi> Thus it is cleare, that there was a cuſtome to put riches and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure into the grave with the dead, to which <hi>Job</hi> might allude in this place,</p>
               <p>So much for the opening of the words from the ſenſe given. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, firſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That neither power, nor wiſedome, nor riches, are any priviledge at all againſt the ſtroake of death.</hi> Here are Kings, men that have great power; Counſellours, men full of wiſedome; <hi>Princes that have riches,</hi> ſo much gold that they can ſtuffe their graves with it, yet theſe cannot defend themſelves againſt death: Death will not obey the authority of Kings, nor doth it feare their frownes;
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:98733:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſubtilty or policy of Counſellours is not able to defeate it, there is no eloquence, no Rhetorick can perſwade death to depart; all the gold and riches in the world cannot bribe death or ſtay its hand; I (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) ſhould have found Kings and Counſellours, and rich men, even all theſe in the grave, and we ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted together. <hi>Riches availe not in the day of wrath,</hi> (Prov. 11.4.) <hi>but righteouſneſſe delivereth from death. Righteouſneſſe delivereth from death,</hi> why, ſhall not righteous men die? Surely <hi>Job</hi> might have ſaid, <hi>with righteous men,</hi> with holy men ſhould I have reſted, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and with <hi>Jacob,</hi> theſe are in the grave, death ſeaz'd on them as well as other Princes, and Kings and Counſellours; How then doth <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, that <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe delivereth from death?</hi> Death is there either to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſome dangerous judgement, for, ſaith he, <hi>riches availe not in a day of wrath</hi>; that is, in a day of publike cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, <hi>but righteouſneſſe delivereth from death</hi>; that is, from thoſe troubles and dangers; God hath reſpect to a righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and hideth him from that death. Or <hi>righteouſneſſe doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from death,</hi> that is, from the evill of death, from the ſting of death, from the bitterneſſe of death; the bitterneſſe and evill of death is paſt to a righteous man. But riches they availe not at all, they cannot at all, as not deliver from death, ſo not mitigate the paine, or pull out the ſting, or ſweeten the bitterneſſe of death; yea rather riches encreaſe all theſe: That is a truth, <hi>O death how bitter is thy remembrance to a man that is at eaſe in his poſſeſſion.</hi> Men may put their riches with them into the grave, but riches cannot keepe them a moment out of the grave. This thought, <hi>How bitter!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, When <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Kings, and Counſellours and Princes,</hi> theſe great men of the world, he ſheweth us what their ſtudy and buſineſſe for the moſt part is in the world, it is about worldly things; <hi>They build deſolate places, they have gold, they fill their houſes with treaſure</hi>; Theſe are their employments, the current of their cares and endeavours runs out this way. Hence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the thoughts of the greateſt and wiſest of the world, are uſually but for and about the world, The poore receive the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,</hi> and the rich receive the world. As a godly man is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by his faith, <hi>Abraham beleeved God</hi>: By feare, by upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by juſtice, as <hi>Job</hi> in the firſt chapter of this Booke, by <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>

In the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> great men are called, <hi>the men of the world,</hi> as if they were for nothing but the world, or all for the world; as if all their proviſions were laid in for this world, ſo it followes, <hi>who have their portion in this life,</hi> ver. 14.

It is ſaid concerning ſuch men, that <hi>their inward thought is, that their houſes ſhall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations, and they call their lands after their own names. Their inward thoughts are upon theſe things</hi>; It is ſomewhat a ſtrange kind of ſpeaking, to ſay, <hi>their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts,</hi> for there are no thoughts but inward, thoughts are all wrought in the ſecret ſhop of the heart.

                  <hi>Their inwards</hi> are, how they may get themſelves a name and riches, not only are their thoughts about theſe things, but the very inmoſt of their thoughts, the moſt retired thoughts and receſſes of the ſoule are about theſe things, theſe lie neereſt to their hearts; As the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſaith of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> when ſhe died, <hi>ſhe had them open her and they ſhould finde</hi> Calice <hi>at her heart,</hi> It was a pitifull caſe, that a rotten Towne ſhould lie (where Chriſt ought) at the heart of ſuch a Princeſſe; The heart is the place where Chriſt and the thoughts of Heaven ſhould lodge: All below Heaven ſhould be below our hearts. But as a godly mans <hi>inward thoughts</hi> are for Heaven and the things of Heaven, for grace and for holineſſe; he hath thoughts upon the world, but (if I may ſo ſpeake) they are his <hi>outward thoughts,</hi> not his <hi>inward thoughts:</hi> That which lies nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt his heart, his inward thoughts are for Heaven: So the inward thoughts of worldly men are for the world; the Apoſtle might well ſay, <hi>Not many wiſe, nor many rich, nor many noble are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> the thoughts of wiſe Counſellours, of potent Kings and rich Princes, are legible in their actions.</p>

                  <hi>That ſome take in their life time more care for their Sepulchers, then they doe for their ſoules.</hi> Here are great men, what doe they? <hi>They build deſolate places,</hi> they will be ſure to have ſtately mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents: <hi>And they had gold,</hi> they will be ſure to fill their graves with treaſure, they will be buried richly, or they will have their riches buried with them; But what care did theſe take for their poore ſoules in the meane time, where they ſhould lie? Had they taken order what ſhould become of their ſoules? When all things are diſpoſed of, this choice peece for the moſt part is left undiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, unprovided for; Some will carefully provide for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they will provide for their families, they will provide for their dead bodies, for their carcaſſes, but for their immortall ſoules there is no proviſion made: While their bodies are aſſured of a reſting place, they may ſay of and to their departing ſoules (as that trembling Emperour beſpake his) <hi>O our poore fleeting wandring ſoules, whether are you going, where is the place of your reſt.</hi> As it is ſaid of <hi>Abſolom</hi> in the place before cited, <hi>He in his life time had reared up a pillar</hi> (a monument, or a Tombe) <hi>for himſelfe in the Kings dale</hi>; What a carefull Prince was this for his body!

And the ſame word is uſed in the Hebrew, to ſignifie <hi>a Giant; There were</hi> (Nephilim) <hi>Giants in the earth in thoſe dayes,</hi> Gen. 6.4. and the reaſon why they are ſo called, is as ſome apprehend, becauſe they were <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> ſuch as fell off from God, from true worſhip and Religion: Or becauſe they did <hi>fall upon men,</hi> as that phraſe is applied to cruell men, <hi>they did fall upon the poore,</hi> So the word is uſed, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. of this Booke, <hi>The</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans <hi>fell upon</hi> Jobs <hi>Oxen,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>They who fall from God by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, will quickly fall upon men by cruelty.</hi> Or becauſe the dread and terrour of them made men to fall downe for feare before them: It is very obſervable, that the ſame word ſhould ſignifie, an <hi>infant</hi> of leſſe then a ſpan long, and a Giant (it may be) of more <hi>then ſix cubits and a ſpan,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.4.) and both upon equall reaſon, and with equall ſignificancy.</p>

And the reaſon of it is given, becauſe men of this height and ſtature in ſin, are men of troubled, unquiet and reſtleſſe ſpirits. As it notes a height in holineſſe and grace, to have a kind of unquietneſſe upon the ſpirit till we can doe good, and compaſſe holy deſignes and purpoſes, when we are not only pious, but zealous; As <hi>David</hi> reſolves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.3, 4. <hi>Surely I will not come into the Tabernacle of my houſe, nor goe up into my bed, I will not give ſleepe to mine eyes, nor ſlumber to mine eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, untill I find out a place for the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. So unquietneſſe upon the ſpirit till it can put ſin into act, and compaſſe an evill project, notes a compleateneſſe in the ſinner.

This word <hi>(Ragaz)</hi> notes any vehement motion, either of mind or body, ariſing from feare, or grief or anger, or the concurrence of them all: As when <hi>David</hi> heard of the death of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> the Text ſaith, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. <hi>The King was much moved,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>That wicked men are troublers both of themſelves and others. There the wicked ceaſe from troubling,</hi> as if the wicked did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world but trouble the world. As before <hi>Job</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſpeciall character of great ones and Princes, <hi>They get gold, build Palaces and Sepulchers, and fill them with treaſure:</hi> So when he ſpeakes of wicked ones, he ſaith, <hi>There the wicked ceaſe from troubling</hi>; As intimating, that while they live in the world, they are a perpetuall trouble to the world. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is expreſſe, (<hi>chap,</hi> 57.20.) <hi>The wicked are as the troubled ſea, that cannot reſt</hi>; they can doe any thing better, then be quiet, they have not ſtrength enough to ſit ſtill, <hi>they cannot reſt.</hi> King <hi>Ahab</hi> had this apprehenſion of <hi>Elijah,</hi> (1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.17.) when the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was full of trouble, (for God did vex them with great adverſity.) <hi>Art not thou he</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ahab) that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Iſrael?</hi> No ſaith <hi>Elijah,</hi> (who could make up a better judgement then <hi>Ahab</hi> in that point) <hi>I am not he that troubleth</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but it is thou and thy fathers houſe. Ahab</hi> had ſold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to worke wickedneſſe, and ſo had ſtock enough to purchaſe trouble for <hi>Iſrael; wicked ones are the troublers of all</hi>; they are troublers of their own families, troublers of the places and Cities where they live, the troublers of a whole Kingdome, troublers of the Churches of Chriſt, and the troublers of their own ſoules, they are borne to trouble both <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive,</hi> they love to trouble, and they have what they love: It is the character and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an extreame wicked man, to be a troubler; Even as it is a great argument of great grace, when you ſee one a comforter of others, or buſie to helpe others, to doe good to others; <hi>The tree is knowne by the fruites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Taking the latter words of this verſe, <hi>(There the weary be at reſt,</hi>) for thoſe wicked men who are wearied by trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling others, we may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That wicked men by troubling others, doe as much weary and tire out themſelves</hi>; And though they find that in troubling others they weary themſelves, yet they will not give it over, they will trouble ſtill. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith thus of a wicked man, in the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of this booke, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>The wicked man travaileth with paine all his dayes,</hi> not only doth he put others to paine, but himſelfe is in paine; and they are frequently expreſſed in Scripture as wearying themſelves, ſometimes as <hi>weary of themſelves,</hi> ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.5. <hi>They weary themſelves to commit iniquity</hi>; And <hi>thou art wearied in
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:98733:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the multitude of thy counſels,</hi> Iſa. 47.13. <hi>Thou art wearied in the greatneſſe of thy way,</hi> Iſa. 57.10. and that was but a way of troubling the Church; <hi>She wearieth her ſelfe with lies,</hi> Ezek. 24.12. The ſins which wicked men commit only in and againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, weary them, but they are moſt wearied, when they are perſecutors of others: It is obſerved of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> that <hi>famous troubler of the Church,</hi> (by him that hath written the <hi>Itinerary of the Saints</hi>) that he did undertake more troubleſome journeyes, and went upon more hazardous deſignes, meerely to trouble, and vex, and oppoſe the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> then ever any of his predeceſſors did about any other conqueſt or noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe; that he travail'd more miles to doe miſchiefe, then (as the Authour doth compare their journeys) any of the Saints did to doe good; and therefore he concludes the ſtory of him, with this generall truth concerning perſecutors, <hi>All ſuch wicked men goe with more trouble to eternall death, then the Saints doe to eternall life</hi>; they toyle themſelves more, and ſuffer more <hi>to worke out their own damnation,</hi> then the godly doe <hi>in working out their ſalvation:</hi> To be wicked in the height, is the height of trouble. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>that a good man is mercifull to his beaſt, but a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man is unmercifull to himſelfe, he will tire himſelfe more then a good man will tire his beast.</hi> This is a certaine truth, <hi>he that will follow ſinne and ſerve his own luſts,</hi> (eſpecially the luſt of pride and oppreſſion, whoſoever ſerveth thoſe luſts) ſerveth a hard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, a maſter that will make him toile, and ſweat, and weary him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe while he lives, and at the laſt pay him with death. The worke of ſin is bad enough, but (as to the ſinner) the wages of ſinne is worſe.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing I ſhall note from it is this. <hi>There the wicked ceaſe from troubling. There,</hi> where is that? At the grave, when they come to die, they make an end of their troubling, not before: Obſerve then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wicked men will never ceaſe troubling untill they ceaſe to live.</hi> In the grave they ceaſe troubling, there they are at reſt; <hi>If they ſhould live an eternity in this world, they would trouble the world to eternity.</hi> As a godly man never gives over doing good; he will doe good as long as he lives, though he fetches many a weary ſtep, ſo wicked men, never give over doing evill, untill they ſtep into the grave. And the reaſon of it is, becauſe it is their nature to doe evill, and that which men doe naturally, they doe alwayes; they never
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:98733:222"/>
give it over, nothing but death can ſuſpend and ſtop nature.</p>
               <p>There are indeed two caſes wherein wicked men ceaſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, while they live. One is, when they are deſperate in their deſignes, and ſee they cannot by troubling themſelves, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble others ſufficiently, when they cannot have their will nor compaſſe their ends fully; they being in deſpaire of doing the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe they would, will doe no more: So the Hiſtorian notes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Diocleſian,</hi>

this rod of the voice (which ſmarts worſe then the voice of the rod,) and from the ſcourge of tongues. And let us pray, that God would haſten the performance either of that gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, (Iſa. 14.2.) <hi>They ſhall take them captives whoſe captives they were, and they ſhall rule over their oppreſſours:</hi> or of that, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.17.) that he would make thoſe great and notable changes in the Church, and give us <hi>for braſſe gold, and for iron ſilver, and for wood braſſe, and for stone iron:</hi> That he would alſo <hi>make our Officers peace, and our Exactors righteouſneſſe</hi>; This will be <hi>a time of refreſhing indeed,</hi> And as <hi>the time of the reſtitution of all things which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſince the world began,</hi> Acts 3.21. namely when <hi>our Officers ſhall be peace, and our very Oppreſſours righteouſneſſe:</hi> When the very troublers of a people become their peace, how great is that peace? when they, who were the oppreſſours of a people, are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be, <hi>very righteouſneſſe,</hi> how great is that righteouſneſſe?

               <p>That the ſmall are there, ſhould be an admonition to young ones, <hi>take heed of putting off repentance untill you are great, for the ſmall are in the grave</hi>; That the great are there, ſhould be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the greateſt and ſtrongeſt, to prepare for death, for all your ſtrength and greatneſſe, your honours, your ſwelling Titles, your vaſt riches, cannot oppoſe, much leſſe prevent or overcome death. <hi>The ſmall and the great are there.</hi> Secondly, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That death makes all men equall,</hi> or <hi>That all are equall in death.</hi> As death equally takes hold of all men, ſo death makes all men equall; not only are the ſmall and the great there, but there <hi>the ſmall and the great are the ſame:</hi> Death takes away all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, and the grave knowes no difference among the ſons of men. While men live, they are at a great diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There is and there ought to be diſtinctions among men, and men ought to know their termes of diſtance, and to acknowledge men in their greatneſſe, power and places. As there is <hi>one glory of the Sunne, and another glory of the Moone, and another glory of the Starres, for one Starre differeth from another Starre in glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41. So there is one terreſtriall glory of Kings, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory of Nobles, and another glory of the Common-people, and theſe have not the ſame glory in common, even among them, one man differs from another man in this worldly glory; but when death comes, there is an end of all degrees, of all diſtinctions,

                  <hi>There the ſmall and the great are the ſame.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeakes of our being in Chriſt, in regard of the priviledges of the Goſpell, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11. <hi>In Chriſt there is neither Jew nor Gentile, there is neither male nor female, there is neither bond nor free,</hi> that is, all have a like and an equall ſhare in Chriſt, and in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Goſpell: the Goſpell makes no diſtinction between poore and rich, in regard of ſpirituall priviledges and benefits; ſo death takes away all diſtinctions in regard of civill priviledges, <hi>In death there is neither ſmall nor great, neither male nor female, neither bond nor free; the greateſt ſhall lie, as low as the ſmalleſt, and the higheſt as low, as the meanest,</hi> every one there ſhall be but as his neighbour, and as his brother in the fleſh. There is but one diſtinction that will out-live death, and death cannot take it away; the diſtinction of <hi>holy and unholy, cleane and uncleane, beleever and an infidell,</hi> theſe diſtinctions remaine after death, and ſhall remaine for ever; but <hi>rich and poore, honourable and baſe, high and low, King and ſubject,</hi> theſe diſtinctions ſhall be done away, and forgotten as if they had never been: no difference, no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (but that which God makes, and that which grace makes) can ſtand out againſt the power and ſtroake of death, <hi>There, the ſmall and great are the ſame.</hi>

                  <hi>To be bitter in ſoule,</hi> notes deep intrinſicall or inward ſorrow; the greateſt ſorrow, makes the ſoule bitter: As in Scripture, when we find <hi>Soule</hi> added reſpecting the evill of an eſtate, or the good of an eſtate, evill and good are meant in the higheſt degree; As when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38. <hi>My ſoule is exceeding heavy, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſorrowfull even unto death</hi>; that is, I am in the loweſt deepes of ſorrow: Sorrow unto death, is ſorrow within one ſtep or degree of death. <hi>My ſoule is ſorrowfull,</hi> there can be no ſorrow but in the ſoule, the body (take it as a diſtinct from the ſoule) is not capable of ſorrow; ſorrow is a paſſion or an affection of the ſoule, an affection of the mind, and therefore all ſorrow is ſeated in the mind; yet when our Lord Chriſt ſaith, <hi>My ſoule is exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull,</hi> It is farre more then to have ſaid, there is ſorrow or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much ſorrow in my ſoule. So here, this phraſe, <hi>To him that is bitter in ſoule,</hi> or whoſe ſoule is bitter; Notes the moſt bitter and grievous ſorrow. When the Pſalmiſt would ſet forth the great ſorrow of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in priſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.18. One tranſlation ſaith, <hi>that the iron entred into his ſoule,</hi> and the Hebrew, word for word is this, <hi>his ſoule came into iron:</hi> We know the ſoule is ſo pure and ſpirituall that iron cannot enter it; We know that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the body can be bound with chaines; The ſoule could quickly ſlip from the moſt watchfull keeper, and breake out from the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt irons, were it not to keepe company with the body. Whereas then it is ſaid, <hi>his ſoule came into irons,</hi> it is only to ſhew, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was under very ſore affliction, even the ſoreſt affliction of the body. As on the other ſide, when <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid, <hi>My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord, my ſpirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour.</hi> We know, nothing properly can magnifie the Lord, or rejoyce, but the ſpirit or the ſoule; yet when ſhe ſaith, <hi>my ſpirit doth rejoyce,</hi> this notes a deepe, pure, internall, ſpirituall joy, with which, ſhe was raviſh'd at that time: And as they who rejoyce in ſoule, would even willingly be rid of their bodies, they are above the body: So they who are bitter in ſoule, are deſirous to be ridde of their bodies; the body is a burden when the ſoule is bitter.

yea life, the beſt, the moſt excellent thing in nature, both theſe become burthenſome; How gladly would <hi>Job</hi> have bin rid of light, how gladly rid of his life? Conſider then, how burthenſome other things (which at the beſt are burdens) may be unto you, If you heare a ſoule complaining of <hi>light and life, and why are theſe given me, when I am in miſery?</hi> Then what comfort thinke you will honour give you? or what comfort will riches give you? or what comfort will beauty give you, in ſuch a condition, as makes you weary of light and life? What comfort will ſin give you, what eaſe will your luſts give you, in ſuch a condition as makes you weary of light and life? I never heard of any of the Saints, that were troubled at any time with their grace, or weary of the favour of God. I never heard any of them ſay, why is grace given to one that is in miſery? or the light of Gods countenance to the bitter in ſoule? I never heard any ſay, wherefore is faith given to a man that is in miſery, or hope and patience to the bitter in ſoule? grace was never a burden to any man, under greateſt burdens, or unſavoury, to the bittereſt ſoule; when you are weary of all other things in the world, theſe will be your ſupports. Therefore labour after thoſe things, which you ſhall never be weary of; even after thoſe things which will be more pleaſant to us, then ever light was, when light ſhall be to others more troubleſome, then ever darkneſſe was to any; let us labour after thoſe things which will be more ſweet to us, then ever life was, when life ſhall be to others, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>It is a trouble to poſſeſſe good things when we cannot injoy them.</hi> Would you know, how <hi>Job</hi> ſpake here as one weary of light and life? It was not under the notion of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> as if he had been weary of theſe in themſelves, but it was becauſe he could not enjoy theſe. <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſures us, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 25.20.) that, <hi>As hee that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vineger upon Nitre, ſo is he that ſingeth ſongs to an heavy heart</hi>; Muſick to one that is in ſorrow, doubles his ſorrow, why? becauſe he cannot enjoy the muſick; a heavy heart can worſe intend muſick, then a heavy eare; only thoſe things which we can injoy in the uſe of them, pleaſe in the poſſeſſing of them: Of all temporalls, the poſſeſſion and enjoyment may be ſeparated, but for ſpiritualls, the very poſſeſſion of them is joy, therefore enjoyment; their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is a pleaſure, and therefore their preſence ſhall ever pleaſe.

                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:98733:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>One thing further, When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wherefore is light given, and life given?</hi> The meaning of it is, <hi>wherefore is light continued, and wherefore is life continued?</hi> for he ſpeakes of himſelfe and others that had light and were alive, and yet he ſaith, <hi>wherefore is light given?</hi> &amp;c. From this we may learne, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every act of continuance of good things to us, is a new act or deed of gift to us</hi>; Mercy is given, every moment it is enjoyed: not only is a new mercy, and a renewed mercy a new gift, but continued mercy is a gift and a new gift; life is a new gift every houre of time we live on the earth; and glory will be a new gift, every minute of eternity, we ſhall live in Heaven.</p>
               <q>Which long for death and it cometh not, and dig for it more then for hid treaſures.</q>
               <p>This 21. verſe doth further explicate who are the bitter in ſoule, even ſuch as <hi>long for death</hi>; when a ſoule (from naturall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) finds a ſweetneſſe in death, that ſoule is in bitterneſſe; <hi>Our affliction and our miſery is indeed worme-wood and gall, as the Church complaines,</hi> (Lam. 2.19.) when death is as honey, and long'd for as the honey-combe. There is bitterneſſe in the death of the body, and yet ſome are ſo bitter in ſoule, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the very bitterneſſe of death, ſweetneſſe; They ſay not as <hi>Agag,</hi> (1 Sam. 15.32.) <hi>Surely the bitterneſſe of death is paſt,</hi> but O that the ſweetneſſe of death would come. To be rid of ſin makes us long for death ſpiritually, to be rid of paine makes us deſire death naturally; therefore he ſaith, <hi>the bitter in ſoule long for death.</hi>

               <p>Obſerve but what a gradation there is in this expreſſion, to ſet forth the greatneſſe of their deſire after death: they doe not only long for it, but they dig for it, digging you know is no ordinary labour, it is an extraordinary worke, a hard labour; As longing is a ſtrong deſire, ſo digging is ſtrong labour, hard labour.

A man will dig the earth for a little money, but when a man diggeth, hoping to find money in the earth, that will make him worke indeed; now they dig after ſuch a manner; And beyond that, he ſaith they dig for it as for hidden treaſure, that's a further degree of their endeavour after it.</p>
               <p>That which we tranſlate, <hi>hidden treaſure,</hi>

                  </note> is but one word in the Hebrew: It ſignifies any hidden thing, eſpecially treaſures, becauſe treaſures uſe to be hid or cloſe layed up. And there is a two-fold hiding of treaſures: There is a naturall hiding, and there is an induſtrious and artificiall hiding. There is a naturall hiding, ſo treaſures are hid, that lie in the bowels of the earth, they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally hid. Then treaſures are hid by induſtry and by art; when we are afraid we ſhall be ſpoiled of our treaſures, or that they ſhall be taken away, then there is a hiding them, and often a digging to hide them in the earth; As now in theſe times of ſpoile and violence, if a rich man heare that thoſe ſpoilers are nigh, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently hides his treaſure. Now either as robbers digge and ſearch for treaſures induſtriouſly hid, or as miners dig and ſearch for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures naturally hid, ſo (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) with ſuch earneſtnes doe theſe dig for death.</p>
               <p>There is one thing here to be reſolved by way of queſtion before we come to the Obſervations; Namely, whether it be lawfull to wiſh for, or to deſire death? <hi>Job</hi> here propoſeth ſuch as long for death; Is it lawfull to deſire death? doth he ſpeake here only <hi>(de facto,)</hi> of a thing which ſome doe; or of that which may be done?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, firſt, That death in it ſelfe is no way deſireable, and it is not an object of deſire. We cannot deſire that (for it ſelfe) which is an enemy or deſtructive unto us. If any ſhould deſire death as death, or under the notion of death, they ſhould deſire that which is deſtructive, that which is their enemy, ſo the Apoſtle calls death; 1 Cor. 15. <hi>The last enemy which ſhall be deſtroyed is death.</hi> Death is an enemy, therefore (as death) no man can deſire it. Indeed, many have deſired death, but ſtill we find ſomewhat elſe at the bottome of that deſire. But what bottome or ground makes the deſire of death lawfull? I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a holy deſire of death, if we deſire death to be free from ſin; when the ſoule ſaith thus, becauſe I ſee, only the end
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:98733:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of living will be the end of ſinning, therefore I long for death that I may ſin no longer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is lawfull to deſire death, that we may have more full communion with <hi>Chriſt the Lord of life. I deſire to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> but why? not that he deſired diſſolution, but that he might <hi>be with Chriſt. Phil.</hi> 1.23. Chriſt is life, and Chriſt is our life. It is better to enjoy <hi>life,</hi> then to live; How much better then is it, to enjoy Chriſt who is life, then to live.</p>
               <p>To both theſe we may referre that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>We that are in this tabernacle, groane being burthened,</hi> they were burthened with ſorrowes, and burthened with ſins, while they were in the tabernacle of the body, yet (ſaith he) it is <hi>not that wee would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon</hi>; he did not groane for the grave, but for glory; not that he might be uncloathed, but cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with immortality; not barely that he might die, but <hi>that mortality might be ſwallowed up of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under theſe notions we may deſire death: yet with this caution, that for the time of it, we referre our ſelves to the good pleaſure of God. For what the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeakes of the inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and abſolute reſolves of worldly men, about gaining in that or t'other City, is by alluſion appliable to theſe ſpirituall greedy merchants, after Heavenly glory, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Goe to now ye that ſay, to day or to morrow we will goe into ſuch a City, and continue there a yeere, and buy and ſell, and get gaine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For that ye ought to ſay, if the Lord will.</hi> So I may ſay, Goe to now, ye that ſay, to day or to morrow, we would die, (<hi>for to die, to us is gaine,</hi> Phil. 1.21.) and goe to that <hi>heavenly City,</hi> that <hi>City having foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God,</hi> and continue there forever, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in and enriching our ſelves with that glory which Chriſt hath bought: for that <hi>ye ought to ſay, when the Lord will, or now if the Lord will.</hi> On ſuch conditions as theſe, and with this caution, we may deſire death, yea long for death.</p>
               <p>But to long for death, only to be ridde of the troubles of this life, to deſire to lye downe to ſleepe in the bed of the grave, only to eaſe our fleſh, and reſt our outward man, is ſinfull. The Apoſtle ſaith (Acts 20.24.) <hi>I count not my life deare, ſo I may finiſh my courſe with joy</hi>; But we ſhall account our lives too cheape, if we feare to finiſh our courſe with ſorrow; If we thinke, that it is not worth the while to live, unleſſe we live in outward comforts; we excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly undervalue our lives, when a croſſe in our lives makes us
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:98733:233"/>
weary of our lives. This was <hi>Jonahs</hi> infirmity, when he had taken pet about the gourd, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.) he would needs die, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the matter, <hi>It is better for me to die then to live,</hi> and all was, becauſe he could not have his will, becauſe he was troubled: This alſo was <hi>Elijahs</hi> infirmity, when he was perſecuted by, and fled for his life from <hi>Jezabel,</hi> 1 King. 19.4. <hi>He requeſted for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that he might die, and ſaid, It is enough now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am not better then my fathers.</hi>

                  </note> This is an infirmity at the beſt; we ought rather to ſeeke to God that he would remove the evill from us, then remove us from the evill: for God hath a thouſand doores to let us out of trouble, though he doth not open the doore of the grave to let us in there and out of the world. He can end our troubles, and not end our lives.</p>
               <p>Yet ſuch a wiſh is much allayed, yea (in ſome caſes) lawfull, if we keepe the former caution, and ſay, <hi>if the Lord will.</hi> If we referre our ſelves to the will and good pleaſure of God, we may deſire to be lay'd to reſt by death, that we may be rid of thoſe paines and evills which we ſuffer in this life. And yet I deſire rather to raiſe the ſpirits of all above theſe troubles while they live, then ſatisfie them how they may deſire freedome from them by death. <hi>When</hi> Solomon <hi>returned, and conſidered all the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that are done under the Sunne, and beheld the teares of ſuch as were oppreſſed, and they had no comforter, and on the ſide of their oppreſſors there was power, but they had no comforter: Then he praiſed the dead, which are already dead, more then the living which are yet alive,</hi> (Eccleſ. 4.1, 2.) that is, he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the dead to be in a better condition then the living. Yet know, that <hi>Solomon</hi> in this place, ſpeakes the words of meere naturall reaſon, not of divine reaſon. For he ſpeakes (though with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit) yet in the perſon of a naturall man. Naturall reaſon ſaith, it is better to die, then live under oppreſſions; but divine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaith, there is more honour to be gained by living under op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, then there is eaſe to be attained by dying from under them. To beare a burden well, is more deſireable then to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from a burden: Eſpecially, if while we are bearing, we can be doing, doing good (I meane) and I meane it eſpecially, if we can doe publike good. A Chriſtian ſhould be content, yea he ſhould rejoyce, in ſuffering much evill upon himſelfe, while he can be doing any, eſpecially if he can doe much good to others. A graciouſly publike ſpirit, will triumph over perſonall troubles
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:98733:234"/>
and labours, ſo long as he ſees himſelfe a bleſſing or a helpe to the publike: and though he longs to die for himſelfe, <hi>and to be with Christ, which is better,</hi> yet he is loath to die, ſo long as he can ſay with bleſſed <hi>Paul, Nevertheleſſe to abide in the fleſh, is more needfull for you,</hi> (or others,) <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.24. When a Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſaid, he had lived long enough, whether he reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Nature or Honour:</hi> Tully <hi>the Orator</hi> anſwered him well, <hi>But you have not lived long enough for the Common-wealth.</hi> Much more may we ſay, when we ſee able and godly men longing for death, becauſe they have lived long enough, whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect common Nature or their own Honour, <hi>But you have not yet lived long enough for the Church of God, and for the common good of his people.</hi> We ſhould be willing to live ſo long, as God, or his people have a ſtroake of worke to be done, which our abilities and opportunities fit us to doe: In this ſenſe, <hi>A living Dogge is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a dead Lion,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.4. That is, it is better to live (though we are the meaneſt) working for God, then die, or be dead, though we have bin the chiefeſt.</p>
               <p>I inlarge this the rather, becauſe of the preſent troubles, and the infirmity of our fleſh, which ſometimes is ready to envy thoſe who die, becauſe we live in ſorrow; and is not ſatisfied with this, <hi>that our ſoules are here ſhelter'd from death, and under the covert of Chriſt, unleſſe our bodies alſo may be ſheltred in death, and lye under the covert of the grave.</hi> So much to that queſtion.</p>
               <p>Let us note ſomething from the words themſelves, <hi>Which long for death and it cometh not, and dig for it more then for hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi> Obſerve firſt, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many afflictions to our ſenſe are worſe then death.</hi> They long for death, becauſe they are in miſery. It is ſaid, and it is a truth, O death how bitter art thou to a man that is at eaſe in his poſſeſſions! And there is a truth alſo in this, O death how ſweet art thou to a man, that is bitter in his ſoule! It often falls out, that to die, is but a ſhort affliction, but affliction many times is a long and a continued death, a frequent death, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of his afflictions, <hi>in deaths often,</hi> (2 Cor. 11.23.) That there is a bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in death, the ſpeech of <hi>Agag</hi> implies, (1 Sam. 15.) <hi>Surely the bitterneſſe of death is paſt:</hi> Yet while a man (as lamenting <hi>Jeremie</hi> complaines, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.19.) <hi>Remembers his afflictions, and his miſery, the wormewood and the gall,</hi> that is, his afflictions and miſery, more bitter then gall and wormewood, his ſenſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:98733:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his judgement, to conclude, that there is a pleaſantneſſe in that bitter thing, which wee call death. Secondly obſerve, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As death finds many before they looke for it, ſo ſome looke for death and cannot find it.</hi> How many are there, whom death ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes before they are aware, and ſeizeth upon them, when they thinke not of it? when-as others are expecting, and longing, and gaping, and gaſping after death, and they cannot meete with it, it cometh not. Indeed, it is a great deale better for a man to expect death, when it cometh not; then to have death come upon him, when he expects it not. Some are calling for death, crying out for death, before they know how to die, before they know how to live, yea, before they know why they lived. It were well for ſuch if they might looſe their longing, and long for death long enough before it cometh; for upon the matter (poore ſoules) they long for Hell, while they long for death, and while they are haſtning from that life and miſery, which will quickly have an end, they are plunging into that death and miſery which will never end. Thirdly obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As death is a puniſhment to moſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mors expectara non veniens, miſerrimam ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit vitam.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſo not to die is a puniſhment to ſome. Job</hi> ſpeakes of it as of an affliction upon ſuch, <hi>they long for death and it cometh not.</hi> Death is an affliction to all, it is a puniſhment to all unbeleevers, <hi>a puniſhment with a sting</hi>; And as all wicked men are puniſhed with death, ſo ſome of them are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with this, that they (for the preſent) cannot die, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 9.6.) <hi>In thoſe dayes men ſhall ſeeke death, and ſhall not finde it, and ſhall deſire to die, and death ſhall flee from them.</hi> It is laid as their puniſhment that they ſhould live, and as an affliction beyond all their afflictions, that then, they could not die. They are in a ſad condition, who can have no remedy or cure of their troubles but death; but how ſad is their condition, who cannot obtaine that remedy? It is like the puniſhment of the damned in Hell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mors prima a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimam nolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem pellit à corpare, Mors ſecunda ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam nolentem. tenet in corpore</hi> Auguſt.</note> they ſhall long for death but it will not come, and they ſhall ever ſeeke for death but ſhall never find it. No wicked man did ever part ſo unwillingly with his ſoule when he died, as he will unwillingly meet with it, when he riſeth againe; And as the firſt death doth part ſoule and body unwillingly, ſo the ſecond death keepeth ſoule and body together unwillingly. They have a taſt of this miſery in this life, whoſe ſoules are truly ſaid, to be impriſoned in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; And O how deſirous are they to dig down theſe mud-walls,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:98733:235"/>
and make an eſcape, but cannot. Fourthly obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is an affliction to nature, to be debarred of any thing it deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, how destructive ſoever it be unto it.</hi> It is (in one ſenſe) a naturall deſire, to long for death, and yet death is the deſtruction of nature: A man under diſtempers of body, in a diſeaſe, a Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is often troubled and grieved becauſe he cannot have thoſe things which will hurt him: He longs for ſuch meates and drinkes as given him, would kill him, and yet a deniall angers him: <hi>The hope of death deferred will make the heart ſick,</hi> and when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire (death deſired) <hi>comes, it is as a tree of life</hi>; Griefe ariſeth from the unſatisfaction of our deſires, and therefore though the thing had, which we deſire, will undoe us, yet the not having it doth afflict us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which long for death and it cometh not, and they dig for it more then for hid treaſures.</hi> Take ſomewhat from this latter branch, <hi>and they dig for it more then for hid treaſure.</hi> Aſſoone as ever <hi>Job</hi> had expreſt their longing deſire after death, you ſee preſently, he tells us that they dig for death. From this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That where deſires are true, they preſently produce endeavours.</hi> He that longs for a thing will labour for it, they are digging pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 18.1.) <hi>Through deſire a man having ſeparated himſelfe, intermedleth with all wiſedome</hi>; If it be death a man deſireth, he will be endeavouring after it. There are ſome <hi>vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leities, liſtleſſe wiſhings and wouldings,</hi> which produce no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; but true deſires, are ever active, naturall deſires are ſeconded with naturall endeavours, and ſo ſpirituall deſires, with ſpirituall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. If a man deſire death, he will dig for it, ſurely then he that deſires Chriſt and longs for eternall life, will be digging for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them. Obſerve further,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That proportionably to the ſtrength of our deſires, is the ſtrength and earneſtneſſe of our endeavours.</hi> As reall deſire cauſeth reall indeavour, ſo ſtrong deſires cauſe ſtrong endeavours: It was not a bare deſire, but an earneſt longing (as was cleared in opening the words.) And it is not a bare labour, but hard labour, digging is ſtrong labour. A meere naturall man, whoſe deſires after ſin are ſtrong and vehement, acts ſin with equall vehemency. The holy Ghoſt ſaith, he doth <hi>evill as he can,</hi> that is, to utmoſt his <hi>canning</hi> or ability, <hi>He drawes iniquity with cords of vanity, and ſin as it were with cart-ropes. He doth evill</hi> (ſaith another Scripture,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:98733:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.3.) <hi>with both hands greedily.</hi> To doe a thing <hi>with both hands,</hi> notes the greateſt endeavour: As when the <hi>Phariſees</hi> are ſaid not to touch the burdens which they laid on others <hi>with their little finger,</hi> it notes their refuſall of the leaſt endeavour, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.4. So a ſpirituall heart, having his deſires turned heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he diggs for heavenly treaſure every day, and <hi>gives diligence to make his calling and election ſure.</hi> They who have ſtrong deſires after Chriſt, labour ſtrongly after Chriſt. So they are expreſt (<hi>Pro.</hi> 2.4.) where <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>wiſedome,</hi> which is Chriſt and all that is Chriſts. <hi>If thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid treaſures</hi>; Such is the ſearch and endeavour that ought to be after Chriſt, and ſuch it will be if there be true and great deſires after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In that he ſaith, <hi>they dig for it, as for hid treaſure,</hi> We may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the beſt things are hardest to come by.</hi> If you will have treaſures, you muſt digge for them; you may have pibble ſtones, flints, above ground, but treaſures lie deepe; And in proportion, the better every thing is, the more digging it requireth; And the beſt things, ought to be moſt digg'd for. They that will have the great bleſſing, muſt wreſtle for it, or the Crowne, they muſt ſtrive for it; We muſt dig for heavenly hidden treaſure, before we have it; And yet both the treaſure and the ſtrength to dig for it, are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given. Fourthly obſerve, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe things which we esteeme moſt, we labour to ſecure moſt.</hi> It is ſaid that they digg'd for treaſures, and that the treaſures were hid. I told you in opening the words, there is a naturall hiding of treaſure, and an induſtrious hiding. Take it in the laſt ſenſe, men that have treaſures will labour to preſerve them, why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe treaſures are much eſteemed, and the things we eſteeme moſt, we preſerve moſt. In the Hebrew, the word that ſignifies <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> ſignifies the <hi>hiding of treaſure,</hi> or <hi>hidden treaſure.</hi> Among all treaſures, ſpirituall treaſures are moſt hidden; they are ſo hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that they are called myſteries, or ſecrets? The knowledge of Chriſt was a hidden treaſure for ſome thouſands of yeares; the Apoſtle in his time calls it, <hi>the myſterie which was kept ſecret ſince the world began,</hi> Rom. 16.25. Againe he calls it, <hi>the wiſedome of God in a myſtery, even the hidden wiſedome which God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained before the world, unto our glory, which none of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this world knew,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8, 9. And as ſpirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:98733:236"/>
ſo our ſpirituall life, is called a hidden life, <hi>your life is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with God in Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3.3. And as our life, ſo our ſpirituall comforts are hidden, therefore called <hi>Hidden Manna,</hi> Rev. 2.17. All our ſpirituall eſtate is treaſure, and it is all hidden treaſure, ſo hidden, that the Saints dig deepe to find it, and when they have found it, they hide it, as Chriſt ſhewes us (Mat. 13.44.) ſpeaking of the <hi>Kingdome of God,</hi> which he compares to a <hi>treaſure hid in the field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth:</hi> He hideth it, not to obſcure it from the light, but to ſecure it from danger: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> hid thoſe pretious ſayings of Chriſt her Son and her Saviour in her heart, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.51. And <hi>David</hi> having found the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, which he prized above any treaſure, <hi>above thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of gold and ſilver,</hi> he hid them in his heart. <hi>Thy word</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſinne againſt thee,</hi> Pſalm. 119.11.</p>

Yet ſome joyne the ſenſe of this verſe with the former, to carry on or lengthen out the ſimilitude thus; <hi>Which long for death, and digge for it as for hid treaſures:</hi> And finding death, they are affected as they who (ſeeking for treaſures) find a grave; For if in digging, they did but hit upon a grave, then they thought themſelves ſure of treaſure and great riches; becauſe treaſure and riches was uſed to be put into graves, as was ſhewed in opening the fifteenth verſe of this Chapter.

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:98733:236"/>
of darkeneſſe, yet here is joy and rejoycing, yea exceeding joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing when they find the grave.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They rejoyce in it, but why? It was that which they had longed for, that which they had long ſought for? if at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time they had bin ſhewed the grave, or commanded into the grave, they would have taken little pleaſure in it. The ſame thing inflicted or threatned by another is dreadfull to us, which deſired by our ſelves is pleaſant and delightfull: It pleaſeth us to have our deſire ſatisfied, though the thing deſired be never ſo unpleaſant: And to be eaſed of preſent evill, makes a future evill appeare in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a perſent good. For Joy is an affection of the mind, ariſing from the apprehenſion of ſome preſent good, even as hope ſprings from the apprehenſion of ſome good, that is to come.</p>
               <p>Further, We may conſider the iſſue of all theſe acts, after they had longed for death, and digged for death, and found death; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon the finding of it, they rejoyce, and rejoyce exceedingly. Hence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which any one truely deſireth and endeavoureth to find, cauſeth him to rejoyce, when he hath found it.</hi> If you deſire death, and ſeek for the grave, the finding of theſe will be to you as life, and as a houſe of mirth: How much more then ſhall we rejoyce, having found good things, the beſt things, after earneſt longing and digging for them. When the wiſe Merchant had found the treaſure hid in the field, the next words enforme us of his joy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.44. When the man after long ſeeking on the mountaines, had found his <hi>loſt Sheepe,</hi> and the woman, after lighting her candle, and ſweeping her houſe, and diligent ſearch, had found the <hi>loſt groat,</hi> they both rejoyced, and called in their neighbours and friends to rejoyce with them, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 15.) It troubles a man to be found of that or him, whom he hates or feares, <hi>Haſt thou found me O mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?</hi> ſaith <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Eliah,</hi> 1 King. 21.20. And it cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light us, to find that or him, whom we love and long for. <hi>Have I found thee O my friend?</hi> will ſuch an one ſay. And if a miſerable man rejoyces exceedingly when deſiring he finds death and a grave, how will the ſoule leape for joy, when we ſhall find him who is the <hi>longing and deſire of all Nations, Jeſus Christ.</hi> How exceeding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly will the ſoule rejoyce, when we ſhall find what we have ſo much longed for, not death, but life, and life not only in Chriſt, but with Chriſt, when we ſhall find, not the houſe of the grave, but a houſe of glory, and glory in the height, an exceeding excelling ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent weight of glory.</p>

               <p>AT the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe of this Chapter, <hi>Job</hi> begins to expoſtulate concerning the continuance of his life; and he caſts his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint into an argument, which was formed to his purpoſe, thus, There is no reaſon, or if there be, ſhew me a reaſon why his life is continued, that liveth miſerably, and would die willingly; But I am the man who live miſerably, and would die willingly: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why is light or life continued unto me? The former part of this argument is contained in the 20, 21, 22, 23. verſes. In which <hi>Job</hi> demonſtrates that there is no reaſon, or at leaſt if there be a reaſon, it is ſuch, as he could not make out, why that man ſhould have his life continued who lives in miſery, and is willing to die. Three of thoſe verſes we have already finiſhed, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth the 23. (which is a part of the ſame reaſon) to be yet opened.</p>
               <p>In this 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe, he (as it were) repeates his argument; He had ſaid before, <hi>Why is light given to him that is in miſery,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo he doth illuſtrate it in the two verſes following: In this 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe he re-inforceth what he had ſaid in other words, <hi>Why is light given to a man whoſe way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</hi> He doubleth his call for a reaſon or proofe of this thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why is light given?</hi>] Thoſe words are not here expreſſely in the Hebrew, but they are ſupplied by our Tranſlatours, and by Tranſlatours in other Languages, from the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe, to make up the ſenſe. The Originall runs thus, <hi>To a man whoſe way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in:</hi> But the queſtion is implied as in the former, and here to be prefixed, <hi>Why is light given to a man

               <p>
                  <hi>To a man whoſe way is hid.] Job</hi> ſpeakes not here of a way in a proper ſenſe, the way wherein men travaile and paſſe in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, from place to place: but <hi>the way,</hi> is a <hi>way,</hi> in a <hi>Metaphor</hi>; And ſo in Scripture, the way of a man is taken; Firſt, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or intention of a man; Secondly, for the courſe and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of a man: and that either for the courſe, wherein we walke toward others, or for the courſe wherein others walke toward us: When it is ſaid here, <hi>Why is light given to a man whoſe way is hid?</hi> the <hi>way,</hi> is either the courſe wherein <hi>Job</hi> walked, reſpecting God, or the courſe which God tooke reſpecting <hi>Job, Why is light given to a man whoſe way is hid?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The way of a man, in his walking before God, is two-fold.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, <hi>Internall.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, <hi>Externall.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>There is an internall, an inward way which the ſoule treads in converſe with God, a ſecret path, a path which no eye hath ſeene. And then there is the outward way of walking. That ſpeech of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> takes in both, <hi>Walke before me and be perfect,</hi> that is, converſe and carry thy ſelfe uprightly before me, in thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and in thy actions. Now when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>his way was hid,</hi> he meanes neither of theſe: for though the internall way, whether it be the way of ſinne, or the way of obedience, be a path ſo ſecret, as that it is alwayes hid from the eyes of men, yet <hi>Job</hi> knew well enough that God ſaw even that way, and therefore he could not complaine that his moſt ſecret way was hid from God. Yea in another place he comforts himſelfe with this, that God knew the ſecret wayes of his heart: For when his friends accuſe him and charge him with hypocriſie, he ſupports himſelfe with this, <hi>My witneſſe is above, and my record is in Heaven,</hi> there is one there that knoweth the way, the ſecret way of my ſpirit with him, to be ſincerity, though you charge the way of my ſpirit, with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. The ſoule hath many wayes of communion with God, which are altogether hidden from the eye of man; man cannot ſee or diſcerne the private paſſages betweene God and the ſpirit, either when the ſoule approves it ſelfe to God; or rejoyceth and exults in God. And as concerning this way, this inward way, as <hi>Job</hi>
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:98733:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knew that it was not hid from God, ſo (I conceive) it did not trouble him, that this way was hid from man; As there are in God certaine <hi>(Arcana Conſilij,)</hi> ſecret myſteries, and hidden wayes of counſell, which he will not communicate to holy men: ſo there are in holy men <hi>(Arcana pietatis)</hi> ſome ſecrets, ſome my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of godlineſſe, which they doe not communicate to the world; and therefore the complaint doth not lye in either of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p>The Church complained, but ſhe was check't for complaining, that her way was hid from God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.27. <hi>Why ſayest thou, O</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ſpeakeſt, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgement is paſſed over from my God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet that place is not to be underſtood of a hiding from the eye of Gods inſpection, as if the Church had any ſuſpition that the Lord did not know, or did not ſee how matters went with them, or in what condition they were; but it is to be underſtood of the eye of Gods compaſſion; There is a ſeeing eye, or contemplating eye, and a compaſſionating or ſuccouring eye. So the meaning of that complaint, is only this, <hi>Why ſayeſt thou my way is hidden from the Lord,</hi> that is, why doeſt thou ſpeake as if God did not regard thee in thy troubles, as if God had no pitty nor compaſſion on thee, no bowels toward thee, <hi>why ſayest thou my way is hid from the Lord?</hi> In the third of <hi>Exodus,</hi> when God comes to help the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he telleth <hi>Moſes, I have ſeene, I have ſeene:</hi> or <hi>I have ſurely ſeene,</hi> namely with an eye compaſſionating their condition, as the next words ſhew, <hi>for I know their ſorrowes.</hi> Now when the Church complained that <hi>her way was hid from God,</hi> her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was, that God did not take notice, ſo, as to pitty and deliver her. Excepting in that ſenſe, ſhe could not conceive that her way was hidden from God; neither is the way of the Church, So, hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from God, but as to our ſenſe: for the Lord pities his people when he corrects them, and therefore <hi>Jacob</hi> is chidden for ſaying ſo, <hi>Why ſayeſt thou O</hi> Jacob, <hi>my way is hidden from the Lord?</hi> Therefore this Text is not to be underſtood of <hi>Jobs</hi> way in reſpect of God, but of the hiding of Gods way, or the hidden dealings of God toward <hi>Job. My way is hid</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> that, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, nor interpret, nor expound the meaning of Gods dealing with me. I am not able to give an interpretation of it, I know not what this thing meaneth: <hi>My way is hid.</hi>

And it is, as if he had ſaid, I am ſo encompaſt with clouds, that I walke in darkeneſſe, and ſee no light; My life is ſo entangled and wrapt up in troubles, that I ſee no way of deliverance or eſcape.</p>
               <p>And this expoſition ſeemes moſt proper, if we take in the latter part of the verſe, where he ſaith, <hi>and whom God hath hedged in</hi>: This explaines the hiding of his way, to be the hedging of his way, ſuch an incompaſſing of him about with ſorrowes, that he could not make his way out.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Chapter, you may remember, that Satan was much troubled that God had made <hi>a hedge about</hi> Job; And now <hi>Job</hi> himſelfe is much troubled, that God had made a hedge about him: I am the man, ſaith he, <hi>whom God hath hedged in.</hi> That which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the object of Satans envy, is now become the object of <hi>Jobs</hi> complaint, a hedge: Sure then it was not the ſame <hi>hedge.</hi> No, that which Satan complained of, and envied at, was a hedge of mercy, and a hedge of bleſſings, a hedge of favour and of protection: But this which <hi>Job</hi> complaineth of, is a hedge of thorny troubles, and of pricking ſorrows: The former was (as we may ſpeake) <hi>a hedge of Roſes,</hi> and this was <hi>a hedge of Bryars.</hi> That was a hedge ſo high and ſtrong, that no evill could come in, to, or breake through, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy him; And this was a hedge ſo high and ſtrong, that no good could come or be brought unto him.</p>
               <p>So then, take the ſenſe thus, <hi>Why is light given to a man whoſe

               <p>And this is it which the Church complaines of, (<hi>Lament.</hi> 3.7.) <hi>He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out</hi>; and verſe 9. <hi>He hath encloſed my wayes with hewen ſtones,</hi> God had built up a wall (as it were) by art, <hi>with hewen ſtones,</hi> he had ſet them ſo cloſe together, that there was no paſſing by, no getting through.

                  <hi>That affliction is uſually accompanied with much darkeneſſe.</hi> Affliction is often called darkneſſe in Scripture, And as it is darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without, ſo it often cauſeth darkeneſſe within. An afflicted perſon hath ſuch darkeneſſe upon his perſon, that he cannot diſcerne, many times, either why God doth afflict him, or when God will make an end of his afflictions. That in the Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10.) is true of outward afflictions, as well as inward, <hi>Who is there among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that walketh in darkeneſſe?</hi> Ther's many an afflicted perſon walkes in a way, hidden in a three-fold darkneſſe. Firſt, The way is hid, in the darkeneſſe of the cauſe for which he came into it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The way is hid in the darkeneſſe of the event, how to get out of it. Thirdly, The way is hid in the darkeneſſe of his preſent duty, what to doe in it: The way of affliction is often wrapt up and hidden in this threefold-darkeneſſe.</p>
               <p>Further, Seeing <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes of this as an addition to all his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and as the complement of them all, that he was thus ſhut up and hedged in, and that his way was thus darke in regard of the cauſe of it. Obſerve, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It increaſeth an affliction greatly, not to know the reaſon of an affliction, or to have the way of Gods dealing hidden, from our eyes.</hi> It is a trouble not to ſee the reaſon of things; The mind is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly eaſed, when the underſtanding hath light; This made <hi>Jeremie</hi> enquire, <hi>Why doth the way of the wicked proſper?</hi> As if he had ſaid, If I could ſee the reaſon of it, it would ſatisfie me, but while thou keepeſt me in the darke, and I can give no account to my owne ſoule or thoſe that aske me, of this thy diſpenſation, to wicked men, <hi>this is the burthen of my ſoule.</hi> It is uſually ſaid,<note place="margin">

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:98733:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the cauſe of it is diſcovered:</hi> But when a Phyſition is in the darke, and cannot find out the cauſe of a diſeaſe, he muſt needs be in the darke for the remedy of it: So it is alſo with a man in regard of any affliction, when he cannot find out the cauſe, he knoweth not what to pitch upon as a remedy. When <hi>Rebekah,</hi> (Gen. 25.22.) had twins in her wombe, and they ſtrugled together within her, ſhe was much troubled, and nothing would ſatisfie her, untill ſhe went to God to know the reaſon of the thing, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith ſhe,) <hi>why am I thus?</hi> And when God had told her, that <hi>two Nations were in her wombe, and that two manner of people ſhould be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from her bowels,</hi> ſhe made no more complaints. So when there are ſuch ſtrivings, ſuch ſtruglings, and contrary motions of trouble in us, or about us, the ſoule goes to God, and enquires why is it thus? Lord, I am more troubled with the ignorance of my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, then with the weight or ſmart of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Take the words as reſpecting the iſſue, or deliverance from trouble, and they affoord us this obſervation, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a great addition to an affliction, not to ſee or diſcerne a way to eſcape or get out of affliction.</hi> To be in an affliction, out of which there appeares no paſſage (unleſſe the ſoule be mightily ſupported by the hand and power of Chriſt) brings within a ſtep of deſpaire. The Apoſtle ſpeakes as much when he ſaith, (1 Cor. 10.13.) <hi>There is no temptation hath taken hold of you, but that which is common to man,</hi> (and then it followes) <hi>but God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, that ye may be able to beare it.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, If God did not indeed diſcover, or make out to you ſome way of eſcaping, I muſt needs ſay, you were never able to beare it, but (ſaith he) God will make <hi>a way for you to eſcape, that ye may be able to beare it</hi>; Meaning, that the opening of this way, would revive their ſpirits, and then they would be able (through the ſtrength of Chriſt) to beare it.</p>
               <p>If ſo, then how ſhall the ſoule beare an affliction, when God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making a way to eſcape, doth as it were make a hedge to ſtop all eſcape? Therefore when the Lord would ſupport his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their troubles, he promiſed that they ſhould have a doore of hope opened to them, <hi>I will give her the valley of</hi> Achor <hi>for a doore of hope,</hi> Hoſ. 2.15. He would give her ſome appearance, ſome glimpſes and openings of deliverance, in and from, their
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:98733:241"/>
preſent dangers. It is threatned, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.25.) <hi>thou ſhalt come out one way againſt thine enemies, and flie ſeven wayes before them,</hi> they ſhould flie many wayes, but they ſhould eſcape no way. <hi>Thou ſhalt come out one one way, and flie ſeven wayes,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">

                  </note> thou ſhalt try this, and that, and every way to eſcape, but thou ſhalt find a hedge at every wayes end, to ſtop and hinder thy eſcape. We uſe to ſay of a man in a diſtreſſed condition, <hi>He is in a wood or in a wilderneſſe.</hi> And when God entangles men in their own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it is ſaid, <hi>He powreth contempt upon Princes, and cauſeth them to wander in the wilderneſſe, where there is no way,</hi> Pſalm. 107.40. So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid of the children of <hi>Iſrael, they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the land, the wilderneſſe hath ſhut them in,</hi> Exod. 14.3. And when a people are as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were, having a a Sea before them, an army behind them, and Mountaines on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand. Then they may ſay (as <hi>Job</hi> did) <hi>their way is hid, and God hath hedged them in.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>For my ſighing cometh before I eate, and my roarings are powred out like water.</q>
               <p>Here <hi>Job</hi> takes up the former propoſition, and applies it particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to his own perſon. Before, he ſaid only in the generall, <hi>why is light given to him that is in miſery, and why is light given to a man whoſe way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</hi> Now he ſaith in effect, it is thus with me, I am a man in miſery, and I am a man whoſe way God hath hid and hedged in, wherefore then is my life continued? And he proves that he was in ſuch a condition, by the effects of it, <hi>ſighes and roarings.</hi> So that this verſe holds forth two things about <hi>Jobs</hi> ſorrow. Firſt, The continuance of it, in thoſe words, <hi>My ſighing comes before I eate.</hi> Secondly, The extremity of it, in thoſe, <hi>My roarings are powred out,</hi> &amp;c. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may be thus framed, That man is in extreame and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall miſery, who doth not ſo much breath, as ſigh, who, when he would ſpeake, is forced to roare: But thus it is with me, <hi>my ſighing cometh before I eate, and my roarings are powred out like water,</hi> therefore my miſery is extreame and continuall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My ſighing cometh before I eate.</hi>] In the Hebrew it is word for word, thus, <hi>before the face of my bread, my ſighings come.</hi> Which Hebraiſme, <hi>(before the face of my bread)</hi> hath a great emphaſis in it. It notes the continuance of his ſorrowes without any intermiſſion, When a thing is ſaid <hi>to be before the face of

As in the negative (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.3.) <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods before me,</hi> ſo we tranſlate it; the Hebrew is, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods before my face,</hi> that is, ſo long as I continue to be thy God, thou ſhalt have no other god; but I ſhall be thy God to all eternity, therefore thou ſhalt have no other gods but me, for ever. So in the affirmative, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 72.5. where under the type of <hi>Solomons</hi> Kingdome, the continuance of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt is prophecied, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> ſaith, <hi>It ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo long, as the Sunne and Moone endureth</hi>; the Hebrew is, it ſhall continue <hi>before the face of the Sunne and of the Moone,</hi> that is, there ſhall be an equall duration of the Kingdome of Chriſt, and of thoſe lights of Heaven, the Sun and the Moone; The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, ſhall laſt as long as the world ſhall laſt.</p>
               <p>So then (according to this ſenſe) <hi>before the face of my bread my ſighings come,</hi> is, as if he had ſaid, looke how long I have my bread before me, looke how much time I ſpend in eating, ſo much time I ſpend in ſighing, my ſorrowings are of the ſame continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with my refreſhings.

               <p>If at any time a man gets reſpite from his griefe, it is when he eates; how reſpitleſſe then was <hi>Jobs</hi> griefe, before whom ſorrow and ſighings ſate (as gueſts) continually at his table.</p>

It is a great affliction that makes a man of ſpirit ſpeake, or complaine: It is a greater affliction that makes a man of ſpirit weepe or mourne.

                  <hi>The thing which I greatly feared.</hi>] The Hebrew is, <hi>I feared a feare, and it is come upon me,</hi> And ſo feare is in the Scripture, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently put for <hi>the thing feared,</hi> by a Metanomy of the effect for the cauſe, the abſtract being put for the concrete, As <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. <hi>I will mock when your feare cometh,</hi> that is, when the trouble which you feared, ſhall come upon you; As if <hi>Job</hi> ſhould have ſaid, this evill, is that which I have fore-ſeene and fore-thought, I had ſuch miſgivings in my ſpirit, long before this, that ſuch a black day might come upon me, and I might be thus hedged in, now I ſee my thoughts are come to paſſe, and my conjectures prove true, the thing which I feared and greatly feared, is come upon me. We tranſlate well, <hi>I greatly feared,</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>I feared a feare</hi>; Such expreſſions raiſe the ſenſe; As when we are ſaid <hi>to be bought with a price,</hi> it notes that there was <hi>a great price</hi> paid for our redemption: To rejoyce with joy, ſhewes the greatneſſe of joy. So here, <hi>To feare a feare,</hi> ſhewes that he was in a great feare, as we tranſlate, <hi>I feared a feare, I greatly feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it may be queſtioned, whether theſe feares of <hi>Job</hi> were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: doth it become us to have ſuch miſ-givings of heart, in reſpect of our outward condition? The Apoſtle biddeth us, <hi>be carefull in nothing, (Phil.</hi> 4 6.) and was it a vertue or a grace, was it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable or ſo much as approveable in <hi>Job,</hi> to be fearfull in all things? Chriſt rebukes his Diſciples becauſe they were afraid in
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:98733:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a ſtorme, and was it well in <hi>Job</hi> that he was fearfull in a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, when he had the faireſt weather, and proſpered in all things? Doth it become a godly man, to be alwayes ſolicitous about his eſtate, and doubting that troubles will come? One would thinke there is trouble enough, in troubles, when they come, a man ſhould not trouble himſelfe with them, before they come. Beſides, it is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.24. reſpecting wicked men, <hi>that God will bring that which they feare upon them,</hi> ſo that it ſeemeth, God is angry with thoſe, who are alwayes fearing, or ſtand poring upon ſuch and ſuch evills as they feare, may come upon them: To theſe God ſaith, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3.) <hi>I alſo will chooſe their deluſions, and I will bring their feare upon them,</hi> becauſe you feared theſe things, you ſhall have your feare: As God gives ſome their prayers in anger, ſo he gives many their feares in anger; And it is as great a ſin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately to feare, that God will take away the meate of our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity or convenience, as it is to pray that God would give us meate to ſatisfie our luſts or wantonneſſe.</p>
               <p>To cleare this, we muſt diſtinguiſh of feare as to the purpoſe we have in hand. There are divers ſorts of feare.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a feare of <hi>wiſedome and caution,</hi> and there is a feare of <hi>torment and vexation.</hi> That which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18.) <hi>feare hath torment,</hi> is not meant of all feare: there is a feare that is a tormenting paſſion, a feare which diſtracts or divides the thoughts about troubles which may come, and there is a feare which only directs us to avoide or prevent the coming of trouble.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a feare which is oppoſed to ſecurity, and there is a feare which is oppoſed to comfort. It was <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, that he wanted the feare oppoſed to ſecurity, when he ſaid, <hi>In my proſperity I ſhall never be moved: Lord, by thy favour, thou haſt made my mountaine to stand ſtrong,</hi> Pſal. 30.6, 7. The feare of <hi>Job</hi> in his proſperity was oppoſed to this ſecurity, he did not ſay, <hi>I ſhall never be moved,</hi> he thought he might be moved: The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God had made his mountaine ſtrong, yet he knew it had but the ſtrength of clay, and therefore might be caſt downe. This was his feare, he lookt upon creatures, as they are, mutable and moveable. Chriſt ſpeakes of a faith of miracles, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move mountaines; and that feare is not contrary to ſaving faith, which cauſeth us to thinke, that our mountaines may be removed. <hi>Jobs</hi> feare was grounded on the uncertainty of creature comforts,

he knew wealth was <hi>britle ware,</hi> and might quickly receive a crack. This feare we ought to carry about us, in regard of our ſpirituall eſtates alſo, <hi>though grace be everlaſting ware,</hi> though we are high-built, and full-growne in grace, though through the favour of God our mountaine of holineſſe, and of comforts be very ſtrong, yet we muſt not be ſecure; though we are <hi>high-built,</hi> yet we muſt not be <hi>high-minded.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> warnes the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gentiles, that they ſhould feare: I grant, ye are in a good eſtate in compariſon of the Jewes, they are caſt off, ye are graffed in, yet let me give you this caution, <hi>be not high-minded but feare.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.20.</note> That feare which is oppoſed to preſumption and ſecurity, is a good and neceſſary feare, in the beſt of our eſtate, whether in grace or nature, whether in worldly or heavenly riches. And ſuch was the feare of <hi>Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is a feare which makes us provide for an evill day, and there is a feare which hindreth us from enjoying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of a good day. The former was in <hi>Job,</hi> doubtleſſe his feare in good dayes, made him diligent to provide for the evill day; As it is ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> (Heb. 11.7.) <hi>That</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God, of things not ſeen as yet, through faith moved with feare, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Arke, for the ſaving of his houſe; Noah</hi> knew the flood would come, this holy feare ſet him a worke to provide an Arke. It is an argument both of wiſedome and of grace, in a calme, to prepare for a ſtorme, in peace, to conſider what to doe in a time of warre, in health, to lay up thoughts about our ſickneſſe, and in a day when the light of Gods countenance ſhines into our hearts, and we walke in the comforts of the holy Ghoſt, then to thinke, a night of deſertion may come: and what ſhall I doe, if I ſhould walke in darkneſſe and ſee no light? Such, as this, was the feare which <hi>Job</hi> feared.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is a feare which makes us diſtruſt God, that he will afflict us; And there is a feare which keepeth us from doing that, which may provoke God to afflict us; This was <hi>Jobs</hi> feare, as was ſhewed, (<hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) <hi>He feared God, and eſchewed evill.</hi> He was loath to grieve and offend God, or to give him any occaſion to be angry.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There is a feare which is <hi>oppoſed to hardneſſe of heart,</hi> and a feare that is <hi>oppoſed to courage of heart. Jobs</hi> feare was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hardneſſe of heart; of this <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes.</hi> And to cleare what
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:98733:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>
feare he meanes, he adds in the next words, <hi>But he that hardneth his heart ſhall fall into miſchiefe.</hi> Where we ſee firſt, that there is a feare oppoſed to hardneſſe of heart: And ſecondly, that to feare that feare alwayes, even in our greateſt proſperity, is not only our duty but our happineſſe: that feare will not interrupt our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, but comfort us. Yea, this feare doth not only conſiſt with comfort, but with courage, and though we may fall into the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which we thus feare, yet we ſhall not fall under them: Such as this was <hi>Jobs</hi> feare.</p>
               <p>So then to take up all: <hi>Jobs</hi> feare was <hi>a feare</hi> of wiſedome and caution, not of torment and vexation; <hi>a feare</hi> oppoſed to ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and preſumption, not to joy and conſolation; <hi>a feare</hi> that made him diligent to prepare againſt an evill day, not a feare that did eate out all the comforts of a good day; <hi>a feare</hi> which kept him from doing that, which might move God to afflict him, not a feare which made him diſtruſt, that God would afflict him; <hi>a feare</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hardneſſe of heart, not a feare oppoſed to courage and ſtrength of heart. Such a feare as this, is a holy feare, ſuch a feare as this, is a good companion in our beſt eſtate: this feare and our comforts may well joyne together, this feare will not trouble, but regulate our lives, not breake, but ſweeten our ſleepe. Obſerve hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That holy wiſedome, ſanctified prudence, biddeth us feare and prepare for evill, in our good dayes.</hi> I was afraid of theſe things, ſaith <hi>Job:</hi> We muſt not ſuſpect, but we ought often to thinke of evills, before they come. A wiſe morall man,<note place="margin">

                  </note> much more a wiſe Chriſtian, while he is earneſtly praying for good, is alſo carefully providing for evill. Leſt the Diſciples ſhould forget trouble in times of peace, Chriſt ſaith to them, <hi>Behold</hi> (Mat. 24.25.) <hi>I have told you before</hi>; Now you are at pretty good eaſe, it may be you thinke, it will be thus with you alwayes, but take heed of ſuch thoughts, I have told you what will be hereafter; <hi>Behold I have told you before.</hi> And againe, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33.) <hi>Theſe things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace, in the world ye ſhall have tribulation:</hi> In the peace we have with Chriſt, we ſhould expect tribulation from the world. The Spirit of God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hints ſuch things afore-hand, to the ſpirits of his people, that they may not be ſurpriſed: <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies, (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.23.) <hi>that the holy Ghoſt every where witneſſed that bonds and afflictions did abide him</hi>; He lookt for trouble in all places, this made him
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:98733:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both patient under, and victorious over all his troubles. Ungodly men feel trouble, before they ſee it, and are often paſt all hope, before they have had any feare; when they have a good day, they thinke their day will be an eternity, and laſt for ever; Thoſe in <hi>Amos, (chap.</hi> 6.3.) were merry, they were ſinging and feaſting, eating the fat, and drinking the ſweete, and what doe they in theſe their good, their only good dayes? The Prophet ſhews us in the next words, <hi>They put the evill day farre from them:</hi> they would have no thought that their eſtate might change, when they had a mind their eſtate ſhould continue; Hence the Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> (chap. 28.15.) deſcribes them, making a covenant with death, and coming to an agreement with Hell: and then they ſuppoſed themſelves ſafe, and under covert, come what would. The Prophets indeed have been talking of judgements and ſcourges; but what of that, we have got a protection, we have covenants in our pockets will be our ſecurity, ſo they were promis'd, and ſo they beleeved, as their words witneſſe; <hi>If the over-flowing ſcourge ſhall paſſe thorough, it ſhall not come neere us.</hi> Theſe are the thoughts of fooliſh and ungodly men, they make bargaines and agreements, as it were, with all troubles, that they ſhall not be touched; others may ſmart, but they have taken order for their own indemnity: <hi>They have made lies their refuge, and under falſhood have they hid themſelves:</hi> And ſo they call cheerefully for their wine, come fetch wine, and <hi>we will fill our ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When a wiſe man falleth into trouble, <hi>he falleth forward,</hi> that is, he falleth into thoſe troubles, which he did fore-ſee; but when an ungodly man, a wicked man falleth into trouble, <hi>he falleth backward,</hi> he falleth into thoſe evills, which he never thought of, much leſſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Many of the people of God at this day, doe, and may ſay of the evills which are now upon us, the things which we feared are come; theſe ſtormes were ſeen long agoe in the clouds; yea in the Sun-ſhine, in faire dayes, theſe foule rainey dayes were fore-ſeene; and they who have fore-ſeen them, and fore-ſeen them with ſuch an eye of faith and holy feare, as we have deſcribed, are in beſt caſe to graple with them, and will be gainers by them. It is well for us, when we can ſay, the things we feared are come upon us; They are in a ſad condition upon whom thoſe evills fall, which they never feared; when troubles come, they goe neereſt their hearts,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:98733:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who have put them fartheſt off, before they came. Hence obſerve in the ſecond place,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the more preparing feare we have before troubles come, the leſſe we are preſt with feares, when trouble comes.</hi> If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Job,</hi> how unmoveably he ſtood the charge and aſſault of theſe afflictions, how he wraſtled with all the diſtreſſes, which at once tooke hold of him, we are to looke (next to the ſupport he had immediately from Chriſt) to this wiſe caution of his, that he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch a ſtorme might overtake him, hefore he got to his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes end: He thought theſe things might come, and therefore laid in proviſion for them, againſt they came. Thoſe blowes wound deepeſt, which we expect not. Dangers unknown,<note place="margin">

That which the <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> ſay of the <hi>Cockatrice,</hi> that if the <hi>Cockatrice</hi> ſee a man firſt, the man dieth, but if the man ſeeth the <hi>Cockatrice</hi> firſt, the <hi>Cockatrice</hi> dies, is an experienced truth, reſpecting the point we have in hand, that if troubles ſee us firſt, we die; but if we ſee them firſt, they die; that is, their ſting and ſtrength (as to us) is much abated. Dangers are moſt felt, where they are not fore-ſeene, and ſometime being fore-ſeene, they are not felt at all; For a prepared expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth either weaken them, or ſtrengthen us, make us more able to ſuſtaine them, or them leſſe able to hurt us; whereas indeed every croſſe which findeth us ſecure, hath an advantage to leave us deſperate. When <hi>Nabal</hi> heard of danger paſt, which he never dreamt might come, <hi>his heart died in him like a ſtone,</hi> (1 Sam. 25.) How then had he been aſtoniſhed into ſtone, if he had ſeene the evill falling upon him. Such can ill beare trouble, who looke for nothing but comfort. It was an addition to the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that afflicted people, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 8.15.) <hi>When they looked for peace, but no good came, and for a time of health, and behold trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>; if they who are in trouble, are more troubled, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the peace they looked for, then ſurely they muſt be more perplext with trouble (when it comes) who enjoying peace, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a thought, that trouble would come. When a people are ſo farre from looking for evill, that they looke for nothing but good, and build upon it, that they ſhall never ſee ſorrow, then to ſee ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is a killing ſight. The ſorrowes of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily increaſt and augmented, doubled and trebled upon her, becauſe

when they are coming upon her, ſhe ſhall be ſaying, <hi>I ſit as a Queen and ſhall ſee no ſorrow:</hi> ſhe was feareleſſe, and ſhe ſhall be comfortleſſe; Trouble will lye heavy enough upon us, when we looke and prepare for it, but it will be intolerable to thoſe, who never lookt for, nor laid in one thought of preparation, againſt its coming. The foole in the Goſpell, ſaid to his <hi>ſoule, take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for many yeares:</hi> But it is beſt for us, when we have aboundance of outward goods, to ſay to our ſoules, <hi>theſe may be loſt in a few houres:</hi> Therefore ſay to thy ſelfe in the time of thy fulneſſe, what, if a day of emptying ſhould come? ſay when you are rich, it may be before I die, I may be poore, what ſhall I doe then? Now I have a houſe, it may be before I die, or within a few dayes, I ſhall be turned out of doores, in what poſture doe I find my ſelfe for ſuch a condition? Now I am at liberty and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy my friends, it may be ſhortly I may be caſt into a priſon, and come into the hand of enemies; now I have my wife and children about me, <hi>my vine and my olive-plants, at, and round about my table,</hi> I may ſhortly be deprived of them, and O my ſoule, how canſt thou beare theſe changes? It is good to put theſe caſes to our ſelves now, ſurely <hi>Job</hi> often tutor'd his ſpirit with ſuch queſtions as theſe, and catechiſed his heart in them from day to day, hence he ſaith, <hi>The things I feared are come upon me</hi>; To proceed

Job</hi> was not like the great Monarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (Dan. 4.4.) who ſaid, <hi>I</hi> Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar <hi>was at reſt in mine houſe,</hi> (it is the ſame word which is uſed in the Text) I, ſaith <hi>Nebuchadeezzar,</hi> counted my ſelfe the greateſt man in the world, and I thought none could touch or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt me, <hi>I was at rest and ſafe:</hi> We have ſuch a deſcription made by the Prophet of a whole Nation, as this King makes of his own perſon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.31. <hi>Ariſe, get ye up unto the wealthy Nation that dwelleth at eaſe,</hi> or (it is the ſame word) to a Nation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either feare or care, a ſecure Nation, as it is explained by the words following, <hi>which have neither gates nor barres, which dwell alone.</hi> If you come to a mans houſe that hath neither lock nor key, nor doore, nor barre, you may well reſolve, that he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſecurely, and is in ſafety. And if you come to a City that hath neither gates nor barres, you will ſay, either this City hath no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or elſe it feares none. A City without gates and barres, is the embleme of ſecurity. <hi>Jobs</hi> temper was directly oppoſed to this, <hi>I was not in ſafety, neither had I reſt, nor was I quiet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two latter expreſſions are of the ſame importance with the former, both theſe words have been opened at the thirteenth verſe of this Chapter; both being there applied to reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the grave. There he ſaid, if he had died, he had been at reſt and quiet: but all his life time, he had no reſt, neither was he quiet. But is this agreeable to the duty or character of a godly man, to ſay, he hath no reſt, he is not quiet? Surely a godly man ought to be quiet, when all the world is hudl'd together in confuſion; when the mountaines skip like lambes, and the little hills like young ſheepe, then, even then, he ought to ſtand like mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that cannot be moved; And did it become <hi>Job,</hi> or is it any part of his commendation, that in the times of his peace, he had no reſt? When the Prophet ſhewes the temper of wicked men, he compares them to <hi>the troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt,</hi> Iſa. 57.20. It ſhould ſeeme
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:98733:248" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that <hi>Job</hi> was like a troubled ſea, for himſelfe ſaith, he could not reſt. I anſwer by diſtinguiſhing, firſt of a two-fold reſt, There is a reſt of contentation, and a reſt of confidence. <hi>Job</hi> had not a reſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, he truſted not in his outward peace; but he had the reſt of contentation, even in his outward troubles. A wicked mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is like a troubled ſea, when he enjoyes outward peace; but <hi>Job</hi> enjoyed peace of conſcience, while his outward eſtate was like a troubled ſea: He was fully ſetled in his mind, when he had no reſt, and was ſatisfied in ſpirit, when he had not this quietneſſe: So that when he ſaith, <hi>I had no rest, neither was I quiet</hi>; his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is only this, I never placed my happineſſe in theſe things, I never built my hopes upon creatures, I never truſted upon them, nor expected much from them. Or if you will more clearely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the ſenſe of this laſt verſe, you may reade it in that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry practice of the rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. His houſe was full, but his heart was fuller of the creature: and he made the creature both his rocke to build upon, and his pillow, to ſleepe upon; when his ground brought forth plentifully, and he had built new barnes to lay up his fruits, then he layes himſelfe down to ſleepe, and that he might ſleepe quickly and quietly, he ſings a <hi>requiem</hi> to his ſoule; <hi>Soule, thou haſt much goods layed up for many yeares, take thine eaſe, eate, drinke and be merry</hi>; No face can be more unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to a face, Heaven and Hell, light and darkeneſſe, are not more unlike, then theſe words of the rich man are unanſwerable in likeneſſe, to thoſe words of <hi>Job.</hi> That rich mans words are the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatives of all <hi>Jobs</hi> negatives, and may be thus rendred in full ſenſe, I was, (and I reſolved I ſhould ſo continue,) <hi>in ſafety, at reſt and quiet. Jobs</hi> eſtate was as full as his, but his heart was emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied of all creature confidence and complacence, I (ſaid he) never thought my ſelfe the ſafer for theſe, and therefore I ſaid to my ſoule, ſoule, take not thy reſt, quiet not thy ſelfe in theſe: This is his intent in ſaying, <hi>I was not in ſafety, neither had I reſt, nor was I quiet.</hi> It followes,</p>

In the thoughts of Chriſt he ſits downe, and would take his fill, he ſaith, <hi>I am ſafe in him, I am quiet and at reſt; He ſaith to his ſoule, ſoule, doeſt thou ſee</hi> That Chriſt, <hi>and doeſt thou take notice of thoſe promiſes? Thou haſt goods layed up in him, in them for many yeares, yea for eternity, ſoule take thine eaſe, take it fully, thou haſt riches, thou haſt an eſtate that can never be ſpent, ſoule, eate, drinke and be merry; his blood is drinke indeed, and his fleſh is meate indeed, joy in Chriſt is joy indeed, unſpeakeable joy here, and fullneſſe of joy hereafter: In his preſence there is fulneſſe
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:98733:249" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of joy, and at his right hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Untill the ſoule pitches thus on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is not in <hi>ſafety,</hi> much leſſe in <hi>reſt</hi> or <hi>quiet.</hi> As the <hi>needle</hi> in the <hi>compaſſe</hi> is in continuall motion till it points towards the <hi>North,</hi> where (as it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) there are rocks of Load-ſtone with which it ſympathiſeth: So the ſoule is in continuall motion, untill it points to Chriſt, who (we are ſure) is that living rock, with whom all beleevers ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſe, and the true Load-ſtone which attracts all beleevers to him. A beleever, like <hi>Noahs Dove,</hi> finds no reſt (all the world over) for the <hi>feete of his ſoule,</hi> untill he returnes to <hi>this Arke</hi> of ſafety and ſalvation: And therefore after all his flights and flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings among the creatures, he ſaith (with the Pſalmiſt) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto thy reſt,</hi> (thy Chriſt) <hi>O my ſoule, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee,</hi> Pſal. 116.7. Thou haſt been abroad in the world, and that (like a narrow-hearted Maſter) deales niggardly with thee; If thou ſhouldeſt ſtay long, either in the ſervice of, or dependance upon the world, the world would ſtarve thee: Therefore returne unto thy reſt, in the Lord, for the Lord hath dealt, (and will yet deale, more) bountifully with thee, O my ſoule.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, In that <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was not in ſafety, neither had I rest,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet trouble came.</hi> We may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That, the more our hearts are looſened from the creatures, the more aſſurance we may have of enjoying the creatures.</hi> It is as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, I was not faſtned to the world, my heart was not engaged to any thing on this ſide Chriſt: and this was the faireſt, the moſt probable way for the continuance of my outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; <hi>yet trouble came.</hi> The redditive particle, <hi>yet,</hi> ſuppoſes ſomewhat in reaſon or probability at leaſt, that might have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it another way. As when the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> reckoning up the judgements of God upon his people, ſpeakes to them thus in his Name, (<hi>chap.</hi> 4.6, 8 9.) <hi>I have ſent you cleaneneſſe of teeth, yet have you not returned unto me, I have ſent you the peſtilence, the ſword, yet have you not returned unto me.</hi> The <hi>yet,</hi> ſhewes there was great reaſon, God ſhould expect their returne, or that he had done that, which in all probability, might have cauſed them to returne, when he ſent thoſe judgements. So here, when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was not in ſafety,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet trouble came</hi>; The <hi>yet,</hi> implies that there was ſomewhat even in that unquietneſſe, which gave him hopes of ſettlement in his outward comforts: It ſeemes to
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:98733:249" rendition="simple:additions"/>
carry ſuch a ſenſe in it, as if he had in more words explained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus. <hi>Had I dwelt ſecurely, and given my ſelfe up, to the contentments of my fleſh, or truſted in an arme of fleſh, for ſafety, I ſhould not have wondred at my calamity, or thought ſtrange of my trouble; But this is a riddle which I cannot yet expound, that when my heart was no way ſet upon my eſtate, my eſtate ſhould fall, That when I rested not in the creature, I ſhould meet with ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the creature.</hi> This is not the manner of God, It is not uſuall for God to doe thus, in his diſpenſations toward his people and ſervants. <hi>It is very rare, that he takes their outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from them, when they are not taken with their comforts.</hi> Hence it is (as I apprehend) that <hi>Job</hi> putteth it in with a <hi>yet trouble came. This way of God with me, is out of the ordinary courſe of providence.</hi> I confeſſe <hi>Mercer,</hi> a very learned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator, doth not favour this expoſition, of laying ſuch a weight upon the particle <hi>yet,</hi>

I was not in ſafety, <hi>&amp;c, And trouble came.</hi> Yet having the authority of our tranſlation, and the frequent uſe of the word to that ſenſe in other places, we may venture upon it; yea I thinke it is no venture, but a certaine advantage both to the Text and to our ſelves. And I am certaine the poſition is true, though the expoſition ſhould not prove ſo: For the truth is, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are never ſo neere, as when we put them furtheſt off: Nor is the world ever ſo unſure to us, as when we make ſureſt of it. God often pulls their comforts from them, whoſe hearts are glued to their comforts; As it is ſaid of thoſe in the 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3. <hi>when they ſhall ſay, peace and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction ſhall come upon them, as paine upon a woman in travaile, and they ſhall not eſcape</hi>; Marke, when they ſhall ſay, that is, conclude all's their own, when out of the aboundance of their hearts their mouthes ſpeake of nothing <hi>but of peace and ſafety, all is well, and all will be well, then ſudden deſtruction cometh:</hi> When a man ſaith, I have riches, I have a full eſtate, I have honour, I am a happy man, I may take my reſt; then poverty, want, diſgrace, miſery, vexations and troubles, fall upon him as an armed man. Thus for the moſt part God wreſts the creatures ſooneſt out of their hands, who hold them faſteſt. In the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Luke,</hi> Chriſt inſtanceth in the <hi>dayes of</hi> Noah, <hi>and in the dayes of</hi> Lot, when they were ſecure, buying and ſelling, building and planting, marrying and giving in marriage, as if the world had been their own, and as if they meant to take
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:98733:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the heart of it out, and leave a poore world for the next age, then the flood came, and then fire came, and they with theirs were ſwept away and conſumed, as in a moment. The Maſter of the ſervant in the Goſpell, <hi>ſhall come in a day:</hi> in what day? Firſt, in a day when he looked not for him. Secondly, in a day when his heart was let out upon the creature, <hi>when he ſhall be eating and drinking with the drunken, when he ſhall be ſmiting his fellow ſervants</hi>; when he ſhall thinke all ſure, and the day his own, <hi>in that day ſhall his Maſter come, even in the day that he looketh not for him, and in an houre when he is not aware,</hi> Luk. 12.45, 46 To have the ſpirit ſteept and drencht, in worldly pleaſures or profits, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers us, to ſome ſuddaine ſweeping judgement: And when we va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the enjoyment of the creature more then we ought, we ſhall not long enjoy it ſo much as we might. Earthly things faile us ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, when we truſt in them, or thinke our ſelves ſafe by them.</p>
               <p>From this obſerve (in paſſage) a vaſt difference betweene God and the world, betweene earthly things and ſpirituall; the way to hold ſpirituall things faſt, is to take faſt hold of them, to cleave to them, with a full purpoſe of heart, never to let them goe; If you carry looſe affections towards Chriſt, you may quickly looſe the comforts of his preſence: The more we reſt upon Chriſt, the more we truſt on God, and make him our ſafety, the more ſafe we are, <hi>Him doth God eſtabliſh in peace peace, in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed upon him, even becauſe he truſts upon him,</hi> Iſa. 26.3. We have moſt peace from God, when we expect moſt, and may looke for more reſt and quiet, when we reſt quietly in him, and ſay, in God <hi>I have enough,</hi> yea as <hi>Jacob, (Gen.</hi> 33.11.) I have all. But if you would have reſt in the world, ſay as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Micah</hi> directs, (<hi>chap.</hi> 2.10.) <hi>This is not our reſt.</hi> Keepe your hearts at a due diſtance from the world, and you ſhall (moſt probably) keep the world; What Chriſt ſpeakes of this life, is true of the things of this life; He that will looſe, (that is, he who is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) to looſe the things of this life, ſhall ſave them: and he that will ſave, that is, he who is reſolved to ſave the things of this life, ſhall looſe them; put them out of your hearts, and you may hold them in your hands: you ſtand firmeſt upon the earth, when you doe but touch it, and touch it (as a round body doth a plaine) only in a point. You are freeſt, from danger, when you ſay, we are not <hi>in ſafety:</hi> freeſt from motion when you ſay, <hi>wee are not in reſt:</hi> And when (in <hi>Jobs</hi> ſenſe) you are <hi>not quiet,</hi> then (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
