            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am ſenſible that I ſtudied it under a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, both by reaſon of my bodily Indiſpoſition, and thoſe neceſſary Affairs that lay upon my hands; which made me the more unwilling to publiſh it.

He was a good and a faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and I queſtion not but he is now enter'd into the Joy of his Lord. His Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Earth gives You ſolid ground to hope that he is advanc'd to Heaven, where he is poſſeſt of a compleat Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity: And that ſweet Savour he has left behind him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes his Family, now his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is cloth'd with Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <p>THE great Apoſtle of our Profeſſion, during the publick exerciſe of his Miniſtry upon Earth, ſpoke very much in Parables, according to the ſtile and manner of the Jewiſh Nation: Hereby ſpiritual things were brought down to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of his Hearers, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by thoſe earthly ones which were moſt familiar to their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108225:5"/>
Underſtandings. We have two Parables in this Chapter, my Text is a part of the latter, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the <hi>14th,</hi> and ends with the <hi>30th</hi> Verſe. The Scope of this Parable was to perſwade Men to diligence in the Service of God, and to a faithful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Benefits which they receive from him.</p>
            <p>In order to the Explication of my Text, I ſhall conſider four things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> The Speaker.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The Perſon ſpoken to.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> The Speech it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4thly.</hi> The time when it was deliver'd. An account of theſe things will give you further light into the whole Parable.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> The Speaker; <hi>His Lord.</hi> Hereby our Lord intends himſelf,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108225:5"/>
who was ready to travel into a far Country, to aſcend to the Emperial Heaven, which is at a vaſt local diſtance from this low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Earth, wherein he then ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed. He hath a double Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over all Countries, <hi>viz.</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and Primitive, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon in the Trinity; and Derivative and Diſpenſatory, as Mediator. Tho many of the human Race refuſe to ſerve and obey him, they are all his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants and Subjects: His Dominion over them is not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their Conſent; he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs their Lord, tho they will not own him to be ſo. In ſhort, they that ſlight his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity now, will find it exercis'd hereafter in the infliction of a deſerved and ſevere Puniſhment upon them. <hi>The unprofitable Servant ſhall be caſt into outer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108225:6"/>
Darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth;</hi> as you may ſee in the <hi>30th</hi> Verſe of this Chapter.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The Perſon ſpoken to: <hi>His Lord ſaid unto Him.</hi> We have an account of the Perſon in the preceding Verſe, and that with reſpect to two things, <hi>viz.</hi> his Receipt, and his Improvement.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Receipt. This Servant had receiv'd <hi>five Talents</hi> from his Maſter. All the Bleſſings that the Children of Men enjoy, flow from Jeſus Chriſt: Temporal good things are diſpenſed by him as the Governor of the World; and ſpiritual, as the Head of the Church. His Favours are not communicated to all in an equal meaſure. We read of one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that receiv'd but one Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, of another that receiv'd two Talents; but this Servant was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108225:6"/>
intruſted with five. The ſupreme Lord makes a conſiderable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between one and another by the diſtribution of his Favours. One hath no more than Food and Raiment, juſt enough to ſupply the Neceſſities of Nature; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abounds in Wealth, his Cup is ſo full that it runs over: one lives obſcurely, and makes no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the World; another is in an exalted Station: one is very weak in his Intellectuals, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is furniſh'd with a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtock of Parts and Learning. And ſurely the Proprietor of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth may diſpoſe of his own as he pleaſes. They that enjoy the leaſt, have more than they deſerve; they that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the moſt, muſt acknowledg that it is not their Worthineſs, but the ſoveraign Goodneſs of their Lord, that hath made them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108225:7"/>
to differ from others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Improvement; <hi>He gained beſides them five Talents more:</hi> he did not hide his five Talents, as his fellow Servant did his one Talent, but laid them out and improv'd them. He gain'd more by his five Talents than the other Man did by his two; his Improvement was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his Receipt. <hi>To whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much he requir'd;</hi> Luke 12.48. The more God hath done for us, and beſtow'd upon us, the more will he expect from us. All that we have receiv'd from him ſhould be laid out in his Service, for the advancement of his Honour. I proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> To the Speech it ſelf: <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant, thou haſt been faithful in a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108225:7"/>
things: enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi> Herein we have his Lord's Commendation of him, and the Happineſs to which he adjudges him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Lord's Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him; <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant, thou haſt been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a few things.</hi> He approves of his Service, and commends him for it. I conceive the latter word <hi>faithful</hi> may be explicative of the former Epithet, <hi>good:</hi> the Goodneſs and Excellency of a Servant chiefly conſiſting in his Fidelity to his Maſter. The things wherein he had been faithful are call'd <hi>few,</hi> in compariſon of what ſhould be intruſted with him, and beſtow'd upon him. The moſt that we receive from Chriſt at preſent, is very little compared with what we ſhall receive from him hereafter. There is a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108225:8"/>
vaſt diſproportion between what we have in hand, and what we have in hope. I may ſay of the Enjoyments, as the Apoſtle doth of the Sufferings, of the preſent time, <hi>that they are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be reveal'd in us,</hi> Rom. 8.18. God will deal more bountifully with his own Children when they come to Heaven, than he ever doth while they remain upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Happineſs to which he adjudges him: <hi>I will make thee Ruler over many things; enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi> We muſt not be ſolicitous to accommodate every word in a Parable to that ſpiritual Truth that is taught us by it. I will not determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe words, <hi>I will make thee Ruler over many things,</hi> do purely ſerve for the ſetting off the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical Narration, or are to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108225:8"/>
taken in a ſpiritual ſenſe. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former Notion they are expreſſive of a kind Maſter's treatment of a faithful Servant; having experienc'd his Fidelity in ſmaller matters, he entruſts him with greater, and advances him to a higher Station. According to the latter Notion they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of that great Felicity which Chriſt will confer upon his faithful Servants in another World. This is further held forth in the following words, <hi>Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord;</hi> whereby is certainly intended the Glory and Bleſſedneſs of the Heavenly State. This is expreſt by <hi>Joy,</hi> becauſe the fruition of it will produce a triumphant and unſpeakable Joy in thoſe that enter into it. Thus <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>In thy Preſence is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy, and at thy right-hand are Pleaſures for evermore.</hi> 'Tis call'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108225:9"/>
               <hi>the Joy of his Lord,</hi> and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably on a double account.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe in the Viſion and Enjoyment of Chriſt the greateſt part of their Felicity will conſiſt. Tho there be many Jewels in that never fading Crown of Glory which ſhall be ſet upon the Heads of Believers in another World, this is the brighteſt and moſt ſparkling. When our Lord prays for the final Happineſs of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he thus expreſſes himſelf; <hi>Father, I will that they be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory which thou haſt given me,</hi> Joh. 17.24. The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſir'd to depart, that he might be with Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Becauſe his Glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the Exemplar and Pattern of that which his People ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. They ſhall enter into that Joy, which he as their Forerunner
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108225:9"/>
is already enter'd into: Not that they ſhall poſſeſs the ſame Glory in all reſpects that Chriſt hath; for his perſonal Glory as the Son of God, and as Mediator, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable; but they ſhall partake of his Glory according to their Capacity. We are told that they ſhall reign with him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. and <hi>that when he ſhall appear they ſhall be like him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. Their Souls ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conform'd to his human Soul, in Purity and Felicity, and their <hi>Bodies ſhall be faſhion'd into the likeneſs of his glorious Body.</hi> An entering into this Joy may denote the plenitude and abundance of it: Here Joy enters into us, but hereafter we ſhall enter into Joy; we ſhall be ſwallow'd up in a fathomleſs Ocean of pure and unallay'd Pleaſures. I proceed,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:108225:10"/>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> To conſider the Time when this Speech was deliver'd. If we look back into the <hi>19th</hi> Verſe, we ſhall find it was <hi>when the Lord came to reckon with his Servants.</hi> Hereby our Lord's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Coming in viſible Glory, to judg both Quick and Dead, is evidently intended: Of this we have a particular account in the latter part of the Chapter. The Heavens muſt contain our aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Lord till the times of the reſtitution of all things, and then he ſhall deſcend from thence in the Glory of his Father, with all his holy Angels, to convene the whole Race of <hi>Adam</hi> before his Judgment-ſeat, to call them to an account for the Deeds done in the Body, and to paſs a definitive Sentence upon them according to their Works. 'Tis true, there is a particular Judgment which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108225:10"/>
follows after Death: When the Soul is ſeparated from the Body, it appears before the Bar of the ſupreme Judg, to give an account of its Stewardſhip, and then receives an irreverſible Sentence of Condemnation, or Abſolution. But I conceive our Lord chiefly reſpects the General Judgment, when the Trial will be public, the Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd with the moſt awful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity; and the Happineſs or Miſery of every Man compleated.</p>
            <p>Having gone thro the words by way of Explication, I might raiſe ſeveral Obſervations from them. But that I may comply with my time, I ſhall only ſpeak to this Propoſition:</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That they who are faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt in this Life, ſhall be poſſeſt of a very joyful and happy State in the next.</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:108225:11"/>In proſecuting this Point, I ſhall,
<list>
                  <item>I. Deſcribe the faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>II. Give an account of that joyful and happy State of which they ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after poſſeſt.</item>
                  <item>III. Show the certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between ſerving Chriſt faithfully in this Life, and the Poſſeſſion of that bliſsful State in the next.</item>
                  <item>IV. Make ſome Application.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to deſcribe the faithful Servants of Chriſt, who they are that ſhall be own'd as ſuch by the Supreme Lord, when he comes to Judgment. They may be deſcribed, (1.) From their State. (2.) From their Actions. The former is neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppos'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108225:11"/>
to their ſerving Chriſt with Faithfulneſs and Acceptance. The Service which they do for Chriſt conſiſts in the latter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their State may be deſcrib'd <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n two Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) They are juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. 'Tis impoſſible that any good Fruit ſhould be brought forth by a Perſon till he be ingrafted into Chriſt, as is plainly taught us by our Lord himſelf; <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4, 5. Now being found in Chriſt, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aving on his Righteouſneſs, are conjoin'd, becauſe they are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. They who are myſtically one with Chriſt, muſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeds be intereſted in his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Righteouſneſs, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly juſtified in the ſight of God. Tho, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was to be firſt accepted, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108225:12"/>
then the Perſon on that account; yet according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace, the Perſon muſt be firſt accepted, and then the Service. Nothing ſhort of an Inveſtiture with Chriſt's perfect Righteouſneſs can render our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons acceptable to the moſt High; and till they become ſo, our moſt ſplendid Services will be abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in his ſight.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) They are renew'd and ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt: Every acceptable Service flows from a Principle of ſpiritual Life. <hi>A corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit,</hi> Mat. 7.18. We may as well ſuppoſe that Grapes ſhould be the Product of Thorns, o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Figs of Thiſtles, as that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified Perſon ſhould bring forth Fruit unto God. <hi>They that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God;</hi> Rom. 8.8. Their Perſons cannot
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108225:12"/>
therefore their Actions cannot; becauſe they are the Products of a Nature at variance with him, a Nature that is not, nor cannot be ſubject to his Law. The faithful Servants of Chriſt are conform'd to his Image: The Law of God is firſt written in their Hearts, and then copied out in their Lives.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall deſcribe them from their Actions: Only I would premiſe this, we are not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they are altogether free from Sin. The moſt faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt offend in many things; their Errors are ſo many and ſo great, that they cannot fully underſtand them: Their beſt Performances are imperfect, being tinctur'd with the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Corruption of their Natures. Should God be ſtrict to mark the Iniquities of their holy things,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108225:13"/>
they could not ſtand before him. But,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) They deſign the Honour of Chriſt in that Service which they do for him. Many carnal Perſons do ſeveral things that are agreeable to the Reveal'd Will of this glorious Lord, and have a proper tendency to ſerve his Intereſt; but they have no eye to his Glory in any of theſe Actions: they only aim at the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own Reputation, the promotion of ſome Secular Intereſt, or the quieting of their own Conſciences. But they who ſincerely ſerve the Bleſſed Jeſus, fix upon his Glory as their ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end; and what Good they do is propos'd by them as a means ſubſervient to it. The grand reaſon of their practical Holineſs and Obedience is, that they themſelves may not only
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108225:13"/>
acknowledg the Glory of their great Maſter, but likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it to others.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) They have a regard to all his Commandments. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which Chriſt gives of his Friends, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.14. agrees to his faithful Servants, <hi>they do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he commands them:</hi> They do not ſlight any Precept on which they can diſcern the ſtamp of his Authority: They make conſcience both of firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table Duties, of thoſe that are Perſonal and thoſe that are Relative of the leaſt as well as the greateſt, of the moſt difficult as well as the moſt eaſy.</p>
            <p>They will not ſay of any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Command, <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> They are ready to do any ſort of Work their Maſter ſets them about, however toilſom and laborious,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108225:14"/>
however mean and contemptible in the eyes of the World, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever coſtly or hazardous: They mind the Duties of every place and ſtation wherein the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God hath ſet them, whether Civil, Domeſtic, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They diſcharge their Duty towards their Country, their Families, and the Church to which they are related, with Integrity and Diligence. And this they do, not by conſtraint, but willingly.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) They lay out all the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents with which they are intruſted in his Service: As they are Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, they improve what he hath put into their hands to thoſe Ends and Purpoſes for which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it.</p>
            <p>Have they a plentiful Eſtate? they do not ſpend it in making proviſion for the Fleſh; nor do
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108225:14"/>
they covetouſly hoard it up, but imploy a conſiderable part of it in ſupporting the Worſhip of God, propagating the Goſpel of Chriſt, and relieving thoſe that are in diſtreſs. They honour God with their Subſtance, and with the firſt-fruits of their Increaſe. Are they advanc'd to any Station wherein they are capable of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt or his People with their Intereſt? they improve it to the utmoſt for ſuch a purpoſe. They ſerve the Lord with thoſe Parts and Abilities, with thoſe Gifts and Graces which he hath beſtow'd upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I proceed to give you an account of that joyful and happy State whereof thoſe faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhall be hereafter poſſeſt: And ſince it is expreſt by <hi>Joy</hi> in my Text, I ſhall mention ſome
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108225:15"/>
things which render that State very joyful, or excite a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Joy in thoſe that enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and then give you the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of that Joy which reſults from theſe Fruitions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> I ſhall mention ſome things which render that State very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or excite a triumphant Joy in thoſe that enter into it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A freedom from thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicities which attend a mortal State. As the privation of Good is cauſe of Sorrow, ſo a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from Evil gives a natural riſe to Joy. Will not a Priſoner rejoice when reliev'd from that Dungeon to which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, and freed from thoſe Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wherewith he was ſhackled? How joyful is a Man when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd from a languiſhing Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and eas'd of racking Pain? Surely <hi>our Mouths will be filled with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108225:15"/>
Laughter,</hi> and our Tongues with ſinging when we ſhall be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed from that mighty train of Evils which <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall brought into this lower World. How will our Spirits exult when we ſhall be ſet at a vaſt diſtance from thoſe things, which often made us ſigh, groan and weep! When we enter into the other World, we ſhall be freed from all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, and from all ſinful Evils.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) From all ſorrowful Evils. <hi>There is no more Death, nor Sorrow, nor ſhall there be any more Pain; for former things are paſt away;</hi> Rev. 21.4. There is no Infirmity of Body, no Poverty, no Diſgrace, no Treachery of pretended Friends, no Perſecution of open Enemies; there are no perplexing Cares, or tormenting Fears, no Temptations from within or without, no Divine Withdrawings. How will the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108225:16"/>
Soul rejoice when it can ſay, I felt abundance of Pain by reaſon of the diſorder of my Body, but now I enjoy perfect Eaſe: I was rack'd and tortur'd with many Cares and Fears, but now they are all chas'd away as the Shadows of the Evening by the riſing Sun: I was violently buffeted by the wicked one, but he is now bruiſed under my Feet, I have obtain'd a compleat and final Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him; I am got out of the reach of his fiery Darts and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Suggeſtions.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) From all ſinful Evils. Theſe are moſt grievous to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Soul, when in a right frame; no Preſſure ſo heavy as that Body of Death which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually carries about with him. Of this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> made a very doleful Complaint, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.34. And from the fountain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108225:16"/>
Sin many actual Sins do frequently ſtream. But all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Habits are entirely rooted out of Believers when tranſlated into another World. No unclean thing can enter into the holy place above. The rags of mortal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement drop from them, as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>'s Mantle did from him when mounting up to that lofty Region. And none of thoſe Sons that are brought to Glory, ever wander from God's Commandments: There is no more diſconformity to the Divine Will in their Actions than there is in their Hearts. And how will the holy Soul exult when freed from thoſe Fetters of Corruption which ſo often kept it at a diſtance from God, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it from doing his Will! To what an extaſy of Joy will it be raiſed, when it finds it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot or wrinkle!</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:108225:17"/>2. The moral Perfection of our Souls. The ſeparate Spirits of juſt Men are made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. As the old Man ſhall then be deſtroy'd, ſo the new Man ſhall come to its full growth, to its higheſt pitch. That moral Image of God which was imperfectly pourtray'd upon us at our Introduction into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace, will be brought to its utmoſt Perfection upon our entrance into the Kingdom of Glory. Now we may conſider this moral Perfection both as it reſpects the Underſtanding, and as it reſpects the Will, the two ſupreme Faculties of the human Soul.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) As it reſpects the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and ſo it conſiſts in a Perfection of Knowledg. <hi>Now we ſee thro a Glaſs, darkly; but then face to face: now we know in part,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108225:17"/>
but then ſhall we know even as alſo we are known;</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. <hi>Then that which is perfect will come, and that which is in part ſhall be done away.</hi> Thoſe things we have at preſent conceal'd from us, ſhall then be unfolded to us: Our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of thoſe things which we are now acquainted with, will be much clearer and more diſtinct than they are while we dwell in this cloudy Region, where ſo many Miſts and Fogs ariſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure our ſight of Divine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Objects, and our Souls are apt to make a judgment of them as repreſented by the Senſes. What bright views ſhall we then have of the Nature and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Deity, of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Myſteries than are contain'd in the everlaſting Goſpel, of the eternal Counſel and Deſigns, of the beautiful and harmonious
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108225:18"/>
Providences of the Eternal King! Knowledg is ſo agreeable to the human Mind, that Men take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Pains, and wade thro many Difficulties in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of it, and are even tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Joy when they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it, tho in a trifling incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable matter. What an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation then will be given to our Joy, by the cleareſt view of the moſt excellent Objects? What Pleaſure will reſult from thoſe bright Idea's of God and Chriſt, wherewith our Minds ſhall be filled?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As it reſpects the Will; and ſo it chiefly conſiſts in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Love, which is a Grace very ſutable to the triumphant State. There is a vaſt difference between that Love which a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Saint bears to his Heavenly Father and his Glorious Redeemer,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108225:18"/>
and that of a triumphant Saint. Our Love, when we come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, will bear a juſt proportion to our Knowledg. The Light wherewith our Minds ſhall be irradiated, will be accompanied with a ſutable warmth of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as a Perfection of Love to God will mightily ennoble our Wills, ſo it will produce ſolid and unſpeakable Joy, foraſmuch as it renders the fruition of God and Chriſt exceeding delightful. There can no ſatisfaction ariſe from the Preſence of an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Object: and the Pleaſure that we take in the Enjoyment of any thing will be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to its ſhare in our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In ſhort, ſince Believers mourn at preſent to find their Love of the ſupreme Being but as ſmoking Flax, how will they rejoice hereafter when it ſhall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108225:19"/>
becom a triumphant Flame?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The full enjoyment of God and Chriſt. Tho the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine gracious Preſence be afforded to Believers in their way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet the glorious Preſence of God will not be enjoy'd by them till they enter into that bliſsful Habitation. Our <hi>Fellowſhip with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is but partial at preſent, hereafter it will be full. Since God is our chiefeſt Good, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Object of our Love, we muſt needs rejoice in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat fruition of him. What a triumphant Joy will ſpring up in our Souls, when we ſhall lie in the Embraces of ſuch a glorious Perſon as our <hi>Emanuel,</hi> one who is <hi>the brightneſs of the Father's Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon:</hi> one who is very nearly related to us, being our <hi>elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108225:19"/>
our Head, our Husband:</hi> one who hath laid the moſt endearing Obligations upon us by what he hath done for us. How pleaſant will it be to dwell with Him, who from Eternity undertook for us as our Sponſor, who in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time took upon him our Nature, ſtood in our Law-place, redeem'd us from eternal Miſery, and purchas'd everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for us by his Obedience and Sufferings; who lov'd us ſo as to give himſelf a Ranſom for us; <hi>of whoſe fulneſs we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and Grace for Grace;</hi> who hath ſuccor'd us in our Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſupported us under our Afflictions, and conducted us to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Society of glorious Angels and glorified Saints. How joyful will that State be, wherein we ſhall dwell and converſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108225:20"/>
with the higheſt Order of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Beings, who have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd many eminent Services for us in the houſe of our Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, <hi>being all miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter to them who ſhall be the Heirs of Salvation?</hi> How pleaſant will it be to dwell and converſe with the whole Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of triumphant Saints, when free from all thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections which attended them in their mortal State, and very much abated the Comfort of their mutual Society? There will be no Diviſions or Animoſities among them, but perfect Unity, and a flaming Love ſhall reign in all their Hearts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The glorious and bliſsful ſtate of our Bodies. When our great Maſter ſhall come again as a quickning Spirit, he will raiſe the Bodies of his Members from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108225:20"/>
their Beds of Duſt, and reunite them unto their Souls: And tho for ſubſtance they will be the ſame that they were before their Diſſolution, yet the Qualities will be greatly alter'd. The Bodies of Believers ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with all glorious Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſutable to their Nature, and partake with their Souls in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Bleſſedneſs in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Immortality; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. The Soul muſt needs have a great Affection for its Body, and when ſeparate from it, deſires a reunion. How will it exult then when the Marriage-knot ſhall be retied, and it ſhall find ſuch a vaſt and happy change made in its dear Relative ſince the doleful Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? How will it rejoyce to poſſeſs an incorruptible, a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, a glorious and an immortal Body?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:108225:21"/>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> I ſhall give you the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of that Joy which reſults from theſe Fruitions, in two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: 'Tis endleſs, and 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decaying.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) 'Tis endleſs. That ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy which is in God's immediate Preſence, laſts for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: It muſt needs be ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Happineſs whence it reſults will be of a perpetual duration. Thoſe Evils from which the glorified Saints are freed, ſhall no more return upon them; they ſhall never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the Beatific Viſion of God, nor diſlodg'd from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Embraces of their dear Redeemer. Tho the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was ſoon expell'd the Earthly Paradiſe, the Seed of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall never be driven out of the heavenly: Their Souls ſhall no more be divorc'd from
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108225:21"/>
their Bodies. In ſhort, when millions of millions of Ages are run out in the fruition of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Pleaſures, their Happineſs will be no nearer to its Period than at the firſt moment of their admiſſion into the Regions of Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) 'Tis undecaying. As they ſhall not ceaſe to rejoice, ſo their Joy will never be impair'd or diminiſh'd: There ſhall be no Clouds to obſcure the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of that Eternal Day. Our Happineſs will be always the ſame, and our Perception of it equal throughout an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Eternity. The long Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Celeſtial Pleaſures will not make us to grow weary of them. There is an infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in God, and whatever is truly deſirable is eminently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd in him. An infinite Good
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108225:22"/>
produces always the ſame pure equal compleat Joy, becauſe it ariſes from its intrinſic Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that wants no foil to commend it. In a word, this Joy is no raviſhing Rapture, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant height of Affection. Thus I diſmiſs the ſecond General Head. I muſt but touch upon the</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſhow the certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between ſerving Chriſt faithfully in this Life, and the poſſeſſion of that bliſsful State in the next. There is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion by way of Merit between the one and the other. Eternal Life is the free Gift of God, and therefore not the proper Reward of our Services. Since we owe a perfect Obedience to our Lord, could we yield that, it would not entitle us to the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But there being many flaws
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108225:22"/>
and defects in our Obedience, 'tis very abſurd to claim ſo great a Felicity on that account. Tho the Word of God aſſures us, that the poſſeſſion of Heaven ſhall certainly follow upon the faithful ſerving of Chriſt on Earth. I might produce ſeveral Texts to this purpoſe, but two ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>We are aſſur'd, that Chriſt <hi>will render eternal Life to them who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for Glory, Honour and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality;</hi> Rom. 2.6, 7. <hi>He that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reap Life everlaſting;</hi> Gal. 6.8. This glorious Judg will at the grand Aſſize pronounce a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon every one ſutable to the kind and nature, tho not to the deſert of his Works. <hi>Then ſhall Men return and diſcern between the righteous and the wicked; between
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108225:23"/>
him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not.</hi> Since all Chriſt's faithful Servants are juſtified and ſanctified, they ſhall certainly be glorified. They who have a right to Heaven, and a meetneſs for it, ſhall infallibly enter into that delectable Habitation. There is ſuch Connexion between the Fruits of electing Love, that they who have receiv'd any one, ſhall certainly receive all the reſt. I proceed,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To make ſome Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How highly doth it concern us to enquire, whether we are the faithful Servants of Chriſt or not! Since this is a matter of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing importance, how ſtrict ſhould we be in the examination of our ſelves, that we may come to a due reſult in our own Minds about
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108225:23"/>
it? Let us ſeriouſly conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Character that hath been given of ſuch Perſons agrees to us. We have a great deal of Work to do, are we diligent in it? Some Talents are intruſted with us all, do we carefully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them? If we loiter and are unfaithful, we cannot conceal our Infidelity from our Omniſcient Lord, tho our fellow Servants may be unacquainted with it. Deceitful Pleas and Excuſes will not avail us, when we ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Judg, whoſe Eyes are as a flame of Fire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How ſad will the Condition of unfaithful Servants be in the awful day of Account! If they that are faithful ſhall enter into the Joy of their Lord, then they that are unfaithful ſhall be doom'd to eternal Sorrow. As there is a vaſt difference between their State
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108225:24"/>
and their Actions at preſent, ſo their Condition will be vaſtly different hereafter. They that ſpend all their time in the Service of Sin and Satan, will receive dreadful Wages, even everlaſting Death, at the end of it. The Talents which are now intruſted with them, will inflame their Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning when they ſtand at their Lord's Tribunal: Since they have ſown to the Fleſh, they ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption. Think of this, O Sinners, before it be too late. That Time, thoſe Eſtates, thoſe Opportunities, thoſe natural and acquir'd Parts which you now profuſely ſquander away, muſt e'er long be accounted for. In a ſhort time Chriſt will ſay to every one of you, <hi>Give an account of thy Stewardſhip, for thou mayſt be no longer Steward.</hi> And how ſad an Account will you give if taken
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108225:24"/>
out of the World in your preſent ſtate? Think what Horror will ſeize you (if not extremely ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid) when Death ſhall ſit upon your quivering Lips, and your Souls ſhall be juſt ready to take their flight into an eternal World! How dreadful will the thoughts of appearing before the Lord be to you, when ſenſibly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Judgment-Seat! Think of that awful Day when <hi>Chriſt ſhall be reveal'd from Heaven in flaming Fire, to take Vengeance upon them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel.</hi> How dreadful a Spectacle will the Supreme Judg be to you who have ſlighted and contemned him, when he ſhall appear in a pompous manner, arm'd with Almighty Power, and attended with a numerous Train, to pronounce an irreverſible Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation upon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108225:25"/>
you? Can you bear to dwell in blackneſs of Darkneſs, and to lie in unquenchable Flames with Legions of Devils?</p>
            <p>Tho you have highly offended your Lord, 'tis not yet too late to find Mercy. He now ſits upon a Throne of Grace, and extends his Golden Scepter to the greateſt Criminals. Come to Chriſt by Faith, that you may be intereſted in his Righteouſneſs, which will free you from the Guilt of your former Infidelity; and receive that Grace from him which will ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate you to ſerve him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the remainder of your days. Know that many who were once in the ſame caſe with your ſelves, are now reigning in Life, thro Jeſus Chriſt their Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What Encouragement have Believers to fidelity in the Service of their Lord! That aſſurance
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108225:25"/>
which you have of a future Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſhould encourage you to lay out your ſelves to the utmoſt in the Service of Chriſt at preſent. The Improvement which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes of the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult.</hi> is a natural Improvement of this Doctrine; <hi>Therefore, my beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know that your Labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> Since Chriſt will beſtow ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Happineſs upon you hereafter, how willing ſhould you be to do your utmoſt to ſerve him here? The Joy that is ſet before you ſhould carry you chearfully thro all the fatigues and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your preſent State.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This may comfort us under the loſs of our Godly Friends and Relations. 'Tis true, the better
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108225:26"/>
they were, the greater loſs we ſuſtain'd by their removal. But the Conſideration of what they have gain'd by a tranſlation into another World, may very much lighten the Affliction, and chear our Spirits under it. Are we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that our deceaſed Friends were good and faithful Servants of Chriſt? we may conclude that they are enter'd into the Joy of their Lord, and therefore have paſs'd thro a very happy Change.</p>
            <p>And I may reaſonably ſuggeſt this to the ſurviving Relatives of that Excellent Perſon whoſe Death hath occaſion'd this Diſcourſe: I think the words of my Text were juſtly applicable to him. To give his juſt Character might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me ſuſpected of Flattery by thoſe who were unacquainted with him. Ever ſince I had the honour of his acquaintance, I took
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108225:26"/>
him to be a ſincere Chriſtian; and the better I knew him, the more I was confirm'd in that Opinion. I found him a ſolid and ſerious, not a flaſhy and airy Profeſſor; one that had a great concern not only for the Welfare of the Nation, but for the Intereſt of Chriſt in it. His Lord had intruſted him with ſeveral Talents; he had a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Income, was in an eminent Station, had great natural Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and a general Reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all ſorts of Perſons. And did he bury theſe Talents? No, he laid them out in the Service of his Lord. How freely and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally did he contribute towards the relief of thoſe that were in want, and the propagation of the Goſpel? I never knew him backward to the promotion of any good deſign; but were it convenient, could give many Inſtances of his readineſs to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108225:27"/>
do good both by his Purſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. He was lovely in every Capacity, a good Subject, a true Patriot, a uſeful and honourable Member of the Church of Chriſt, a loving Husband, a careful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a kind Maſter, and a faithful and affectionate Friend. But he is gone, his place ſhall know him no more: having <hi>ſerv'd his own Generation by the Will of God, he is fallen aſleep;</hi> God hath call'd him away in the midſt of his days, when many unprofitable Servants are left behind. Such a loſs, ſo Publick, ſo General, ought to be bewailed. Now a righteous Man is periſh'd, a merciful Man is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and we ought to lay it to heart. But let us not mourn as thoſe that are without hope. It would be a good Improvement of this Providence, if Men of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Eſtate would imitate his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108225:27"/>
Example. That covetous nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Spirit which prevails among the Profeſſors of this day, is a great Reproach to our holy Religion.</p>
            <p>I cloſe with a ſhort Addreſs to the mournful Relations of this worthy Perſon: Have a care of repining at the Hand of God, tho you have receiv'd a ſevere ſtroke. He that has taken him from you, firſt gave him to you, and had a ſoveraign Right to diſpoſe of him. It highly becomes Creatures and Subjects to acquieſce in the Will of the ſupreme Lord. God is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all his Ways, and holy in all his Works, and his Will is always agreeable to infinite Wiſdom. The ways of his Providence are all Mercy and Truth, even when he ſeems to walk contrary to them. For your Comfort, think of that happy State into which your deareſt Friend is enter'd;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108225:28"/>
Death was a bleſſed Gain to him; he has thereby obtain'd a Poſt not to be exchanged for the higheſt Preferment in the Court of an Earthly Prince. Be followers of him as he was of Chriſt. Study to ſerve your Lord in your Day and Generation with uncorrupted Fidelity; ſo ſhall you alſo be own'd by him in the day of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: he will then ſay to you, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servants; You have been faithful over a few things, I will make you Ruler over many things: enter ye into the Joy of your Lord.</hi>
