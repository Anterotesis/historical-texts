         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may bee you haue not, as yet, heard the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our proceedinges, and carriage, towards thoſe two Reverend Brethren, who came latelie hither, to recommend to vs, and our People, the <hi>LATE COVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT</hi>: Wee declare therefore to you, That we hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their comming, and intention, and beeing of a contrarie mynde, reſolved, that before wee ſhould giue conſent, that they ſhould preach to our People, wee would propone to them, by way of certaine DEMANDS, the chiefe reaſons which made vs to bee averſe from their proceedings; promiſing to admit them to our Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, if they ſhould giue vs ſatisfaction, concerning the <hi>LATE COVENANT.</hi> Wee intended not to Print theſe DEMANDES at the firſt; but afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering howe much our People might bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by them, in that pious reſolution which they haue, to continue in the obedience of the Lawes of this Church and Kingdome, concerning <hi>EPISCOPACIE,</hi> and thoſe thinges which were concluded in <hi>PEARTH ASSEMBLIE</hi>; wee thought good to put them to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:499:3"/>
Preſſe, but determined not to make vſe of them, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulgating them, except we ſaw that our people ſtood in preſent neede of them; which indeede came to paſſe: for vpon Fryday, the twentie of <hi>Julie</hi> laſt, theſe Reverende Brethren came to this Towne, and having that ſame night receaved our DEMANDES in writ, they returned their <hi>Anſweres</hi> vnto <hi>them</hi> on Saturday following, late in the evening: but they came not to our handes, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto them, vntill Sunday in the morning. Neyther had we leaſure to reade, or conſider, vntill both the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were ended in our Churches. Wherefore wee did meete together that day, at foure houres afternoone, that wee might peruſe them. And at that ſame tyme, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that theſe Reverend Brethren had preached in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of dyverſe of our people, conveaned in the court of a noble man his lodging, not having obtayned our conſent thereto, and in their Sermons had vſed a forme of <hi>Anſwering</hi> to our DEMANDES, which they did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licklie reade, affirming, that they had given full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to vs, in a written coppie of their <hi>Anſweres,</hi> which they had ſent to vs: and by that meanes, had laboured to diſſwade and draw our People from their obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>PEARTH,</hi> &amp; the Lawes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ratifying them: wee knowing how inſufficient their <hi>Anſweres</hi> were, to giue ſatisfaction to anie, who would duelie ponder our DEMANDES, gaue licence to the Printer to divulgate them, and the next day did wryte our REPLYES to their <hi>Anſweres,</hi> intending to put them to the Preſſe on Tueſday. But wee were earneſtlie entreated by a noble Man, to ſend backe to them the copie of their <hi>Anſweres,</hi> that they might reviſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them, &amp; alſo to delay the printing of our REPLYES vntill Fryday following. Which wee willinglie granted. But wherefore this was deſired of vs, you may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; ſeeing they neyther added, nor diminiſhed, nor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:499:3"/>
altered anie thing in their <hi>Anſweres.</hi> Vpon the next Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at night, wee gaue our REPLYES to the Printer: and to theſe Reverende Brethren, who returned not to this Citie, vntill Saturday following, wee ſent a copie of our <hi>Replyes</hi> in writ, on the <hi>Lords Day</hi>: vnto which we recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not their <hi>Anſweres,</hi> vntill they came from the Preſſe, to wit, on Tueſday the fourteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi>: that is, eyghteene dayes after they had receaved our REPLYES. What ſucceſſe theſe Brethren had in their Sermons, which they preached here, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two ſeverall <hi>Lords Dayes,</hi> it is ſufficientlie knowne: neyther haue they reaſon to talke ſo much of it as they doe, in their Preface to the Reader. The firſt of theſe <hi>Dayes,</hi> ſome few who were thought to bee that way inclined before, ſubſcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their <hi>COVENANT</hi>: But the next <hi>Lords Day,</hi> they ſcarce prevailed with anie at all. And a great many, who heard them both theſe <hi>Dayes,</hi> profeſſed, that they returned from their Sermons, more averſe from the <hi>COVENANT,</hi> than they were before. Now good Reader, wee preſent to thee our REPLYES, to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Anſweres</hi>; which for ſhortneſſe cauſe, wee haue called <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PLYES</hi>: wee pray you conſider them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiallie. And if you reape anie benefite by peruſing them, let it not be aſcrybed vnto vs, but to the invincible force of divyne Trueth. Wee conclude with <hi>Zorobabell,</hi> ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat your <hi>Anſweres,</hi> Reverende and Deare Brethren; haue not in anie degree ſatisfied vs, wee impute it not to your weakneſſe, whom wee know to bee able Men, and much exercyſed in the matters debated betwixt vs: but wee impute it to the weakneſſe of your cauſe, and to that inabilitie which is in all men, as well as in you, to beare out agaynst the Trueth. Wee are ſorie that yee are not ſo reſpectiue, and favourable, in your judgement of vs: for yee playnlie declare in your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, that yee ſuſpect vs of prejudice: and that for two reaſons. The firſt is, that our <hi>Demandes,</hi> which yee conceaved had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:499:4"/>
beene meerelie intended for you, were publiſhed before your comming in Print: as alſo, that our <hi>REPLYES</hi> were Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before we receaved your laſt <hi>Anſweres</hi> to them. Whence yee conclude, that wee were rather ayming at victorie, moved thereto by prejudice, than at ſatisfaction by ſearching of the Trueth. This reaſon is grounded vpon a miſtaking: for altho our <hi>Demandes</hi> at the firſt, were intended for you onlie, yet afterwardes we reſolved to Print them, as alſo our <hi>REPLYES,</hi> (the Printing whereof did nowayes depend vpon your ſecond <hi>Anſweres,</hi>) not for loue of contention, nor deſire of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, (GOD knoweth) but for ſuch reaſons, as wee haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in our Preface to the vnpartiall Reader, whom wee hope wee haue ſatisfied in this poynt. Your other reaſon is, that the groundes of your <hi>Anſweres</hi> to vs, haue proven ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to others; who for Age and Learning, are pryme men of this Kingdome: and to whom our modeſtie will not ſuffer vs, to preferre our ſelues. Farre be it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs to be ſo preſumptuous, as to preferre our ſelues to ſo manie Learned and worthie Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vynes: and as farre bee it from vs, to meaſure the ſoliditie, and ſufficiencie of your <hi>Anſweres,</hi> by the Habilities or Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe, who haue acquieſced in them. If this your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were good, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> might more probablie accuſe vs of prejudice, (as indeede they vnjuſtlie doe) becauſe your <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres</hi> to our <hi>Argumentes,</hi> haue proven ſatisfactorie to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thouſands of thoſe, who for profunditie, and ſubtilitie of wit, are inferiour to none of the World: but wee regarde not this ſlender motiue, remembring theſe wordes of our Saviour, <hi>I thanke Thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe Thou haſt hid theſe thinges from the Wyſe and Prudent, and haſt revealed them vnto Babes: even ſo, O Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in Thy ſight.</hi> Beſides, if yee compare the Divynes, Ancient and Moderne, who are of our judgement, with theſe who favour your opinion, eyther in number, or in the excellencie of their gifts, ye ſhall find that in this, the advantage is greatlie ours. In the meane tyme yee
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:499:5"/>
ſhall know, that wee can bring farre better reaſons to free our ſelues of prejudice, than theſe which yee haue brought agaynſt vs: to wit, the ſoliditie of our <hi>Argumentes,</hi> which haue put you to ſuch ſtraytes, (pardon vs to ſay that, which everie one who hath eyes, may ſee) that oft-tymes yee doe not ſo much, as attempt to anſwere them, beeing glad to paſſe them by, with the ſhow of an <hi>Argument</hi> in <hi>contrarium,</hi> or ſome other lyke ſhift: our humble and earneſt atteſtations, in calling GOD, the onlie competent judge; as witneſſe of our ſinceritie, in the inmoſt thoughtes of our ſoule; our ſeriouſlie profeſſed Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to concurre with you, if wee ſhould get ſatisfaction from you: the Modeſtie, Ingenuitie, and Peaceableneſſe of our wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to you, and on the contrarie, your too great diſdainful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and aſperitie in your ſecond <hi>Anſweres;</hi> bewraying not onlie the weakneſſe of your myndes, farre by our expectation, but alſo the weakneſſe of your cauſe to vnpartiall Readers, who aſcrybe this to the pungent force of our <hi>Anſweres;</hi> judging, that they haue made you ſome-what more cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke, than you were before. To this wee will adde the great reluctance, which ſome of the moſt Judicious Subſcribentes did finde in their Conſciences, before they ſubſcrybed your <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> together with the Limitations, and Reſervations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ſubſcrybed it; evidentlie arguing their ſtrong appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, of the dangerous ambiguitie and haske ſounding of the wordes of the <hi>Late Covenant</hi>: ſo that even theſe who are now joyned with you, haue beene much affrighted with thoſe thinges which terrifie vs. As for your <hi>Proteſtation</hi> in the ende of your Epiſtle, that yee can no more bee brought to our mynde, than yee can bee drawne from the profeſſion of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as it hath beene reformed, ſworne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Altho this importeth no ſmall prejudice, poſſeſsing and over-ruling your myndes; yet looking to the invincible force of that Trueth which wee mayntayne, wee even yet hope that at laſt it ſhall prevaile with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpeciallie conſidering that our controverſie is not concerning the reformed Religion; wherevnto wee as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:499:5"/>
ſincerelie adheare as anie who-ſo-ever, but concerning the equitie of that forme of <hi>Covenant</hi> which yee latelie made. Wiſhing you and all others, to adheare truelie and ſincerelie, to the ſame true Religion; and to all the dueties which in it are recommended to you: wee moſt humblie, and earneſtlie pray the Almightie GOD, to pittie His Church in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to vnite all our heartes in Trueth and Peace, in theſe moſt dangerous dayes: which although they bee to you dayes of gladneſſe, as yee profeſſe, yet to thoſe who loue the peace of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the tranquillitie of this Kingdome, they are Sad and Melancholious dayes, in reſpect of the blacke clowdes of GOD'S wrath, hanging over our heads, &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs with ſtormes of fearfull Calamities: which wee pray the Almightie GOD to avert.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N our Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the <hi>Papistes,</hi> (which haue bene frequent, and by GOD'S grace not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull,) as wee haue learned, that to multiplie objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the Trueth, is a thing ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as yee ſay, but fruitleſſe and vaine: ſo alſo wee haue learned, that to multiplie Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, agaynſt ſolide <hi>Arguments</hi> brought for the <hi>Trueth,</hi> is a thing no leſſe eaſie, but altogether vnprofitable: which wee pray you take heede to. <hi>How forcible are right wordes? but what doeth your arguing reproue?</hi> IOB 6.25.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:499:6"/>2. Yee ſay, that our objection, agaynſt your calling, and the warrand of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to vs, was framed &amp; publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in <hi>Print,</hi> before it was proponed vnto you, and ere your <hi>Anſwere</hi> could bee had. Indeede our DEMANDES were at the Preſſe at your comming, that they might be in readineſſe; but were not publiſhed, before your ſelues in your Sermones did publicklie reade them, and diſpute agaynſt them, in audience of ſuch of our People as were there preſent for the tyme; albeit that written copie of them was delyvered to you onlie, and not at that tyme communicated by vs to anie other.</p>
               <p n="3">3, Your Authoritie which ye acclayme, is neyther from his <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> nor warranded by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor by the Lordes of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Counſell, nor by anie <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Synode</hi> of this Kingdome, nor by anie <hi>Judicatorie</hi> eſtabliſhed in it. And both in your firſt <hi>Anſwere,</hi> as alſo now agayne yee profeſſe, that yee came not hither to vſurpe the Authoritie, of anie Civill or Spirituall Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. As for your multitude, (which yee call <hi>allmoſt the whole Kirke and Kingdome</hi>) it beeing deſtitute of Authoritie foreſayde, maketh no warrand of ordinarie calling. Therefore, yee ſeeme to pretende an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie calling from GOD, alleadging an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie neceſſitie at this tyme, which truelie wee ſee not in anie ſuch degree, as may deſerue and warrand ſo great a change from the receaved order, which is publicklie by Lawes eſtabliſhed in this Kirke and Kingdome. That ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let vs conſider one another, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke vnto loue, and to good workes,</hi> which yee alleadge for your extraordinarie imployment, importeth not an extraordinarie calling, but an ordinarie duetie, to bee performed by all Chriſtians, according to their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Word of GOD, and the <hi>Canons</hi> of Councells, doe ſo permit to Paſtors, the care of the whole Kirke,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:499:6"/>
as they muſt remember to doe all thinges, Decentlie and in Order, and not to interpone themſelues in their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns charges, and agaynſt their will. And praiſed bee GOD, there was not anie Combuſtion, Errour, or Confuſion, in theſe places of our charges, as yee doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge: Neyther did our People ſtand in neede, of ſuch helpe from you. And if yee meane the Combuſtion of our <hi>Nationall Kirke,</hi> wee doe thinke your remeede not convenient; as beeing, in our judgement, not agreeable to the right way of <hi>Trueth</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Whereas yee alleadge, that if ſome members of this Kirke, had not cared more kyndlie, in this tyme of common danger, than others haue done, the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die had beene ere now dangerouſlie, if not deſperatelie, diſeaſed; Wee anſwere, That wee moſt heartilie wiſh, anie diſeaſe of this Church, to bee tymouſlie prevented and cured. But withall wee wiſh this to bee done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a rupture, and ſuch a dangerous diviſion: chieflie ſeeing our Church is not infected with anie ſuch Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roures, nor is in ſuch dangers, as may giue juſt occaſion, of ſo fearfull a diviſion: which in it ſelfe is a ſore diſeaſe, and from which in holie Scripture, wee are often, and verie earneſtlie dehorted. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Novatus,</hi> recorded by <hi>Euſebius, Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Hiſtoriae Cap.</hi> 37. worthilie ſayeth, <hi>You ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue ſuffered anie thing what-ſo-ever, for avoyding of cutting aſunder the Kirke of GOD: and Martyrdome for keeping the Kirke from</hi> Schiſme, <hi>is no leſſe glorious, than which is ſuffered, for not committing</hi> Idolatrie. <hi>And in my opinion alſo it is greater; for in ſuffring Martyrdome for not committing</hi> Idolatrie, <hi>a man ſuffereth for one, even for his owne ſoule; but heere a man ſuffereth Martyrdome for the whole Kirke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Yee affirme, that we haue no reaſon to complayne of your carriage, heere towards vs, in reſpect yee for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:499:7"/>
your Sermones preached to our People, made choyſe of vacant houres, that they might attende the ordinarie tymes of Worſhip. But indeede this ſatisfieth not our complaynt: for we juſtlie complayned of your preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our People, without our conſent, at anie houre; and of your labouring, to make them Subſcrybe the <hi>LATE COVENANT,</hi> before yee had given ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to vs, concerning the equitie of it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Yee reprooue vs for theſe harmleſſe wordes of a <hi>Confoederation,</hi> and <hi>Negatiue Confeſsion.</hi> That little <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> was long agoe called <hi>Negatiue, à parte ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jore.</hi> And as for that other word, it is well knowne to all thoſe who are expert in our Mother Tongue, and in the <hi>Latine,</hi> that <hi>Covenanting,</hi> and <hi>Confoederation,</hi> doe ſignifie one, and the ſame thing: and therefore, both theſe wordes are alyke reſpectfull, in our judgement. Whereas yee ſay, that your <hi>COVENANT</hi> is made with GOD, and doe call it His <hi>COVENANT</hi>: and lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe for juſtifying your ſwearing, and Subſcrybing thereof, doe bring ſome places of Scripture, wherein mention is made of a <hi>COVENANT,</hi> &amp; <hi>Oath,</hi> betwixt GOD and His People; wee ſhall then allowe the ſame name, and reſpect vnto your <hi>Covenant,</hi> when yee ſhall make it manifeſt, that your <hi>Covenant</hi> in all poynts therein contayned, hath no leſſe warrand from the written word of GOD, than that <hi>Covenant</hi> which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did ſweare in the dayes of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> (IOSHVA 24. <hi>verſe</hi> 25) and in the dayes of <hi>Jehojada</hi> the Prieſt, (2. KINGS 11. <hi>verſe</hi> 17) and in the dayes of King <hi>Aſa,</hi> (2. CHRON. 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 15) and that which is mentioned by ISAIAH, 44. <hi>verſe</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As wee are ſtill informed, that ſome haue fled the Countrey, and ſome haue Subſcrybed for feare; ſo no Paſtors in our knowledge haue gone to <hi>Court,</hi> for the cauſes alleadged by you. Wee doe not preſume to judge
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:499:7"/>
of the Conſciences of men, and wee wiſh you to judge more charitablie, of theſe Reverende Prelates, than yee doe. The occaſion of this preſent ſtorme was pretended to bee the <hi>Introduction</hi> of the <hi>Bookes</hi> of <hi>Service,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> and the high <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> Theſe cauſes are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and yet the ſtorme continueth ſo vehement, (as yee ſeeme to grant) that the Biſhops haue juſt feares warranding their flight, to ſaue their perſons; which wee judge to bee too great violence, for anie ſuch cauſe, agaynſt perſons in ſo ſacred a calling.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Wee ſhall aſſuredlie, (by the grace of GOD) ſtill contribute, <hi>as yee deſire,</hi> our prayers, and all other meanes agreeable to our conſciences, for extinguiſhing of the preſent <hi>Combuſtion.</hi> And for that effect, everie one of vs ſhall ſecretlie, and humblie, mourne before the LORD, and ſhall ſearch and trye our wayes, and turne vnto the LORD. And as wee haue alreadie hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled our ſelues publicklie, with Faſting and Mourning for that effect, ſo are wee readie in tyme to come, to doe the lyke, when it ſhall bee indicted or allowed by <hi>Authoritie,</hi> according to the eſtabliſhed order in this Kirke and Kingdome. Yea, alſo wee are readie to joyne with you in the <hi>Late Covenant,</hi> ſo ſoone as wee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue ſatisfaction to our conſciences, concerning the lawfulneſſe thereof; which as wee haue proteſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo doe wee yet proteſt, and profeſſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Reaſons which yee touch in your firſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,</hi> for proving that wee might without juſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to anie, joyne with you in Subſcrybing the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> are ſufficientlie anſwered in our firſt <hi>Replye.</hi> For, <hi>First,</hi> It is not yet diſcerned in a <hi>Nationall Aſſemblie,</hi> whether your <hi>Interpretation</hi> added to the <hi>Olde Covenant,</hi> bee in all poynts ſound or vnſound; and therefore wee haue reaſon to thinke, that this <hi>New Covenant,</hi> is not ſubſtantiallie one with the <hi>Olde</hi>: chieflie ſeeing it addeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:499:8"/>
to the <hi>Olde Covenant,</hi> not onlie your <hi>Interpretation</hi> of it, but alſo a promiſe of forbearance of the practiſe of <hi>Pearth Articles,</hi> vntill they bee tryed in an <hi>Aſſemblie</hi>; and lyke-wyſe a <hi>Band</hi> of <hi>Mutuall Defence,</hi> by force of <hi>Armes,</hi> made without the King's privitie and conſent. <hi>Secondlie,</hi> Your inference of <hi>Mutuall Defence, agaynſt all perſons what-ſo-ever,</hi> drawne from the words of the <hi>Olde Covenant,</hi> is meerlie invalide. For nothing was pactioned or promiſed in the <hi>olde Covenant,</hi> without <hi>the King's Majeſtie</hi> his privitie; but the <hi>Band</hi> of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Defence, agaynst all perſons what-ſo-ever,</hi> in this your <hi>New Covenant,</hi> is without the command or conſent of the <hi>King,</hi> to whom onlie the <hi>Sword</hi> is given in this Kingdome, immediatlie by GOD. See to this purpoſe the words of <hi>King IAMES the ſixt of bleſſed Memorie,</hi> in his booke entituled, <hi>The Law of free Monarchies,</hi> in the Engliſh edition of his royall workes, at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1616. <hi>Pag.</hi> 206. That which yee adde concerning the <hi>Generall Band,</hi> is alſo little to the purpoſe, for that <hi>Band</hi> had the King's warrand, where-as his Majeſtie doeth now forbid your <hi>Covenant. Thirdlie,</hi> Altho the former <hi>Oath</hi> ſubſcrybed, did appertayne onlie to the perſons of the ſubſcrybers, all the dayes of their lyues; yet you haue in your <hi>Interpretation,</hi> extended the <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> thereof, to the preſent and ſucceeding generations in this land, without anie warrand eyther from <hi>Publicke Lawes,</hi> or from the wordes of the <hi>Oath</hi> it ſelfe: which alſo is a <hi>Subſtantiall Difference</hi> betwixt that <hi>Oath,</hi> and your <hi>Late Covenant.</hi> Where-as yee alleadge, that the warrand which the <hi>Olde Covenant</hi> had from <hi>King, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,</hi> and <hi>Aſſemblie,</hi> remayneth virtuallie, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet diſcharged; wee anſwere, it remaineth not, and that becauſe <hi>King JAMES of bleſſed Memorie,</hi> diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that <hi>little Confeſſion,</hi> in reſpect of the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the multitude of <hi>Negatiues,</hi> as is cleare by his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:499:8"/>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference holden at <hi>Hampton Court, Anno</hi> 1603. And no former <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Counſell,</hi> made in the tyme of anie former King, doeth ſufficiently warrand our conſciences to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrybe anie <hi>Oath</hi> now, which ſeemeth to vs to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi>; and which our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Dread Soveraygne LORD, the King's Majeſtie,</hi> by his publicke <hi>Proclamations</hi>; and other <hi>Intimations</hi> of his Royall pleaſure, forbiddeth vs to Subſcrybe. And as for the <hi>Acts</hi> of theſe two <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> which did injoyne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to the ſayde <hi>Little Confeſſion,</hi> they were <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> to the <hi>King's Mandate,</hi> which is now expyred by his owne declaration, and with his Royall breath, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that common <hi>Maxime: Morte mandatori: expirat mandatum. Extra. De officio &amp; poteſtate judicis dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gati,</hi> Cap. 19. <hi>relatum eſt in gloſſa.</hi> For the injunction was given for that tyme onlie, as wee conceaue, beeing war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randed by the wordes of theſe <hi>Aſſemblies.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. So alſo Doctor <hi>Bilſon,</hi> in his Booke entituled, <hi>The true difference betwixt Chriſtian Subjection, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Rebellion,</hi> printed at <hi>Oxford Anno</hi> 1585, <hi>Pag.</hi> 382. in the wordes cited by you, declareth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie, that hee ſpeaketh of ſuch Republickes &amp; States, as haue defences warranded by fundamentall <hi>Covenant,</hi> in that <hi>Governement.</hi> But what is that Doctors mynde, concerning the duetie of Subjects, in a free and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchie, is evident by his owne words in that ſame booke, <hi>Pag.</hi> 380, where diſputing agaynſt a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> hee ſayeth; <hi>Warre for the Catholicke Religion, is both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and honourable,</hi> you ſay: you muſt adde, <hi>of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectes agaynſt their Prince, or elſe you range cleane beſides our queſtion.

You proue, which is nothing to our purpoſe. But, Sir, in this enterpryze, the perſon muſt bee reſpected as well as the cauſe: Bee the cauſe never ſo juſt, if the perſon bee not authorized by GOD to draw the Sword, they bee no just nor lawfull Warres. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men may not venter on Warres, vnleſſe they bee directly warranded by him that hath the Sword from GOD.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne in that ſame booke, <hi>Pag.</hi> 502, <hi>Our Saviour for

teaching his, that they ſhould bee brought before Kings and Rulers, and put to death, and hated of all men for His Name ſake: addeth not, as you would haue it, and hee that firſt rebelleth, but, hee that endureth to the ende, ſhall bee ſaved</hi>; and agayne, <hi>Not with violence reſtrayne them, but in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience poſſeſſe your owne ſoules. This is the way for all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Subjects to conquer Tyrants, and this is the remedie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyded in the New Testament agaynst all perſecutions, not to reſiſt powers, which GOD hath ordayned, leſt wee bee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but with all meekneſſe to ſuffer, that wee may bee crowned.</hi> And <hi>Pag.</hi> 513. hee ſhoweth, that manifolde formes of <hi>Common-Wealthes,</hi> make diverſe men ſpeake diverſlie of the Magiſtrates ſword. And <hi>Pag.</hi> 518. hee pleadeth, that the Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> haue not that lawfull warrand, to draw the ſword without conſent of their Prince, as the <hi>Germanes</hi> haue without conſent of the <hi>Emperour</hi>; and this diſcourſe hee proſecuteth in ſome following pages.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The ſame is the meaning of Doctor <hi>Rivet,</hi> (as wee take it) in his Commentarie vpon the PSALME 68; where he diſtinguiſheth betweene an abſolute Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie, and ſuch a Principalitie as is onlie Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, Pactionall, Conventionall. Of this ſecond ſort are to bee vnderſtood, his words of juſt and neceſſarie defence. But of the abſolute Principalitie ſpeaking in that ſame place, hee recommendeth to Subjects, rather ſuffering of <hi>Martyrdome.</hi> And this to bee his meaning, appeareth more clearlie by his laſt declaration concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this queſtion, in his late Treatiſe entituled, <hi>Jeſuita Vapulans</hi>: where beeing preſſed by an adverſarie, hee handleth this queſtion of purpoſe. In the meane tyme, wee wonder verie much, that yee haue not directlie anſwered to theſe remarkeable wordes of Doctor <hi>Rivet,</hi> alleadged by vs in our <hi>Replye,</hi> wherein hee playnlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verreth,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:499:14"/>
that the doctrine of <hi>Buchanane, Knox,</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> concerning Subjects reſiſting their lawfull Princes, is not approved by anie ſound <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> Wee expected from you, a full and particular <hi>Anſwere</hi>; and now agayne we would gladlie heare, whether yee approue the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Rivet,</hi> concerning that doctrine of theſe wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or not.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Thus having vindicated theſe three divynes, which yee alleadge for you, wee come now to thoſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which wee promiſed, for clearing of the playnneſſe of the way touching <hi>Authoritie.</hi> Firſt, it is evident by holie Scripture, that it is vnlawfull for Subjects in a Monarchicall eſtate, (ſuch as is this Kingdome of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) to take <hi>Armes</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> or for anie other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, without warrand and power from the Prince, and Supreame Magiſtrate. For the Scripture teacheth vs, that the SWORD belongeth onlie to the KING, and to them who are <hi>ſent by him,</hi> ROM. 13. 1. PET. 2.13.14. That <hi>wee ought to keepe the King's commandement,</hi> and that <hi>in regarde of the Oath of GOD,</hi> ECCLES. 8.2.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:499:14"/>
given it. And therefore who-ſo-ever taketh the <hi>Sword</hi> without his warrand, hath juſt reaſon to feare the foreſayde warning of our Saviour. Manie other places of Scripture might bee adduced to this purpoſe, which for brevitie wee omit, and doe proceede in the next rowme to ſome teſtimonies of ancient Fathers, &amp; other wryters.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his Apologeticke, Chap. 30. and 33. and 37. telleth vs, that the ancient Chriſtians in his tyme, altho having an heathen and perſecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, did honour him, as <hi>choſen of GOD,</hi> and <hi>ſecond from GOD,</hi> and <hi>firſt after GOD</hi>; and did chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer, than to make reſiſtance by force of Armes, altho they lacked not number, and ſtrength to doe it.</p>
                  <p n="11">11.

Where-as for clearing of that which yee ſayde before, concerning the mynde of our Reformers, yee affirme, that <hi>The authoritatiue judgement of our Reformers is evident, not onlie by the Confeſſion of Fayth ratified in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo by the bookes of Diſcipline, Acts of Generall Aſſemblies, and by their owne writs</hi>: Firſt, wee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, how yee can ſay, that the private writings of Maſter <hi>Knox,</hi> and others, who with him were inſtruments of that great worke of <hi>Reformation,</hi> haue publicke autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to obliedge the Subjectes of this Kingdome. The legiſlatiue, and obligatorie power of the Church, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in <hi>Synods</hi> or conventions of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> and not in particular perſons expreſſing their myndes apart. Next, this Church in the former age, by abrogating the office of <hi>Superintendents,</hi> eſtabliſhed in the firſt booke of Diſcipline, hath declared, that the ſtatutes &amp; ordinances contayned in thoſe bookes, are not of an authoritie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuallie obligatorie, but may bee altered or abrogated by the Church, according to the exigencie of tyme. The ſame lykewyſe is manifeſt by the abrogation of <hi>ſummarie excommunication,</hi> which this Church did abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, altho it was eſtabliſhed in <hi>Generall Aſſemblies,</hi> wherein Maſter <hi>Knox,</hi> and other <hi>Reformers,</hi> were preſent. Wee neede not to inſiſt much in this, ſeeing ſo manie of you, who are Subſcribents, miſ-regarde the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of our Reformers, praefixed to the PSALME BOOKE, concerning the office of <hi>Superintendentes,</hi> or <hi>Biſhopes, Funerall Sermones,</hi> and <hi>ſet formes of Prayer,</hi> which they appoynted, to bee publicklie read in the

Hence the <hi>Reader</hi> may perceaue, that ye haue no warrand for your <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Olde Covenant,</hi> from the authoritatiue, and obligatorie judgement, of the <hi>Reformers</hi>; ſeeing yee can not ground it vpon the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of <hi>Fayth</hi> ratified in <hi>Parliament.</hi> As for thoſe other <hi>Meanes</hi> mentioned by vs, to wit, <hi>Scripture, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie,</hi> and <hi>conſent of the Reformed Churches;</hi> that they true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie make for vs, and agaynſt you, the vnpartiall <hi>Reader</hi> may perceaue, by theſe our <hi>Disputes.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. As for the ſecond <hi>Miſs-taking</hi> mentioned by you in your <hi>Anſwere,</hi> wee did ſhowe in our <hi>Replye,</hi> that in your <hi>Covenant, Pearth Articles,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> are abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

For yee are afrayd to expreſſe <hi>that period of tyme,</hi> leſt yee bee forced to graunt, that which wee before objected. And yet your ſpeach bewrayeth you: For ſeeing yee anſwere onelie to that which wee ſayde concerning the laſt of theſe two <hi>periods,</hi> wee collect, that by <hi>the recoverie of the libertie and puritie of the Gospell,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:499:20"/>
as it was eſtabliſhed before the fore-ſayd Novations,</hi> yee meane the reducing of the <hi>Policie</hi> of this Church, vnto that eſtate in which it was, before <hi>Pearth Articles,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> were eſtabliſhed.

True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, wee are perſwaded, that they who knowe the ſtate of this <hi>CHVRCH,</hi> and your mynde, concerning theſe thinges, will thinke this your Gloſſe of your owne wordes, to bee violent, and excogitated for cluding our <hi>Argument.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Secondlie: Who can thinke, that yee, and others, <hi>Contryvers</hi> of the <hi>Late Covenant,</hi> who condemne
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:499:21"/>
                     <hi>Pearth Articles,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> as much as yee doe <hi>the conſequentes of them,</hi> haue onelie vowed, to remoue their <hi>Conſequentes,</hi> and not remoue them-ſelues?</p>

                  <p n="8">8. Fourthlie, how can wee, without great prejudice of our cauſe, acknowledge, that theſe groſſe abuſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by you, haue entred in the Sacrament, by <hi>kneeling before the Elements</hi>? (yee ſhould haue ſayde <hi>at the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Elements)</hi> for ſeeing <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the receaving of the Sacrament, is confeſſed by vs to bee a matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different; if in our <hi>Oath,</hi> wee acknowledge theſe groſſe abuſes to haue entred in vpon <hi>Kneeling,</hi> it will probablie follow in the judgement of ſome, and in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who recommend this <hi>Oath</hi> vnto vs, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low infalliblie, that <hi>Kneeling</hi> for the evill conſequences thereof, ought to bee removed.

For altho yee vrge vs not, as yee ſay, to ſweare and promiſe the removing of <hi>Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> yet yee vrge vs, by your owne confeſſion, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the removing of theſe abuſes occaſioned by <hi>Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>: which beeing acknowledged by vs, yee will then take vpon you to demonſtrate, that <hi>Kneeling</hi> it ſelfe ought to bee removed: for yee holde it for a <hi>Maxime, That thinges indifferent, beeing abuſed and polluted with</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, <hi>ſhould bee aboliſhed.</hi> Wee can not ſufficientlie marvell, how yee who are of this mynde, can ſay to vs, that wee who allowe <hi>Pearth Articles</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> may ſweare to <hi>recover the Libertie and Puritie of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:499:21"/>
as it was before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For yee meane, that wee may doe ſo, <hi>without prejudice of our cauſe.</hi> But wee haue alreadie ſhowne, that according to your judgement and doctrine, if wee ſweare that which yee would haue vs to ſweare, our cauſe ſhall bee much prejudged, yea, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie loſt.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Fiftlie: Howe can wee ſweare, <hi>to remoue theſe groſſe abuſes entered in vpon Kneeling,</hi> as yee alleadge; ſeeing wee thinke, that no ſuch abuſes haue entered in vpon it? Yea, our people, trye them who pleaſe, will ſhow, that they are as free from all erronious conceits, concerning that holie Sacrament, as anie living in theſe Congregations where <hi>Kneeling</hi> is daylie cryed downe.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Sixtlie, as for theſe abuſes and corruptions, reckoned vp by you, as the conſequentes of the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Festivall dayes,</hi> to paſſe by that which before wee marked concerning <hi>Kneeling,</hi> to wit, that the granting of this were a great prejudice to our cauſe, ſome of theſe are not abuſes at all, as, <hi>ceſſation from worke.</hi> Agayne, ſome of them haue not come in vpon the obſervation of the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Pearth,</hi> as <hi>Guyſing,</hi> and <hi>Feaſting,</hi> (yee meane <hi>exceſsiue Feaſting,</hi> for otherwyſe it is not an abuſe) which onlie fall foorth on <hi>Chriſt-mas Feaſtivitie.</hi> For ſure wee are, that theſe abuſes haue not come by the anniverſarie commemoration of <hi>CHIST'S Nativitie,</hi> in the which by the ordinance of <hi>Pearth Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie,</hi> all <hi>Superſtitious obſervation,</hi> and <hi>Prophanation</hi> of that day, or anie other day, is prohibited, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to be rebuked. This the Reverend and learned <hi>Biſhop of</hi> EDINBVRGH, in his defence of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Pearth Aſſemblie,</hi> concerning <hi>Feaſtivities,</hi> PAG. 63. proveth, becauſe (ſayeth hee) wee haue lacked preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon Chriſt-mas day, theſe fiftie ſeaven yeares by-gone,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:499:22"/>
in our Church, yet Ryot, Prophaneneſſe, Surfet, and Drunkenneſſe, haue not beene wanting.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Seaventhlie, as for <hi>Superſtitious obſervation of dayes,</hi> (whereof hitherto wee haue had no experience) wee marvell, that yee can reckon it, amongſt the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentes</hi> of the obſervation of dayes: ſeeing in your judgement, it is all one with the obſervation of dayes. For yee thinke the <hi>obſervation</hi> of anie daye, except the LORD'S Day, to bee, in the owne nature of it, <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> and <hi>Will-worſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. As for the laſt part of your <hi>Anſwere</hi> to our <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> concerning the fore-ſayde <hi>period of tyme</hi>; where yee alleadge, that <hi>manie Corruptions,</hi> of <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Arminian doctrine,</hi> haue entered in the Kirke, &amp;c. wee aske you, Whether yee deſigne heere an other <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of tyme,</hi> than yee did before? or if yee deſigne on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie this ſelfe-ſame <hi>period of tyme,</hi> (in the which both the fore-ſayde <hi>Practicall Abuſes,</hi> and theſe <hi>Doctrinall Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,</hi> haue entered into this Church, accompanying, a yee alleadge, <hi>Pearth Articles,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacie</hi>?) Or, laſt of all, If yee deſigne no <hi>period of tyme</hi> at all? If yee take you to this laſt, profeſſing, that yee haue heere deſigned <hi>no period of tyme</hi>; then yee anſwere not our <hi>Argument,</hi> where-in wee particularlie, and expreſslie poſed you, concerning that <hi>period of tyme,</hi> vnto which your wordes cited oft before, haue reference. If yee deſigne the ſame <hi>period of tyme,</hi> then looke howe yee can eſcape our praeceeding <hi>Argumentes,</hi> concerning that <hi>period of tyme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. But if yee deſigne an other <hi>period of tyme,</hi> then wee aske you, Whether it bee <hi>prior,</hi> or <hi>posterior,</hi> to the <hi>period of tyme</hi> alreadie mentioned; to wit, the tyme praeceeding the bringing in of the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Pearth</hi>? Yee can not ſay, that it is <hi>posterior</hi> to it: for yee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:499:22"/>
of <hi>Arminian Corruptions,</hi> even before <hi>Pearth Aſſemblie</hi>; branding ſome of the moſt Learned of our Church, with that <hi>Asperſion.</hi> And of <hi>Popiſh Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> yee complayned, when <hi>Pearth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> were eſtabliſhed. For the <hi>Doctrines,</hi> of the <hi>lawfulneſſe</hi> and <hi>expediencie</hi> of theſe thinges, are, in your judgement, meerlie <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and <hi>Antichristian.</hi> Neyther can yee ſay, that it is <hi>prior</hi> to the fore-ſayde <hi>period of tyme</hi>: for the tyme praeceeding the in-brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of <hi>Pearth Articles,</hi> comprehendeth all that tract of tyme which interveaned betwixt the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Pearth Aſſemblie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. But wee will yet more evidentlie convince you, by two other <hi>Arguments,</hi> drawne from that part of your <hi>Covenant,</hi> of which wee are now ſpeaking, and from the wordes of this your <hi>Anſwere,</hi> to our fourth RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLYE; for firſt in your <hi>Covenant</hi> yee promiſe, and alſo will haue vs to promiſe with you, <hi>To forebeare for a tyme, the practiſe of Pearth Articles, vntill they bee tryed,</hi> as yee ſay, <hi>in a free Aſſemblie.</hi> But this forbearance importeth a manifeſt prejudice, and wronging of our cauſe: for this is a fore-acknowledgement, eyther of the vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, or elſe of the inexpediencie of the matters, concluded in <hi>Pearth Aſſemblie.</hi> For wherefore ought wee in this exigence of the Church, to forbeare the practiſe of <hi>Pearth Articles,</hi> rather than of other <hi>Rites</hi> of the Church, except for ſome greater evill comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in them? This will appeare more evident, if wee ſhall conſider the reaſon alleadged by you, <hi>Pag.</hi> 17, wherefore wee ought now to forbeare the practiſe of theſe <hi>Articles</hi>: to wit, becauſe <hi>in the caſe of Scandall, and ſenſible feare of Superſtition,</hi> wee ought to doe ſo. Now this <hi>caſe of Scandall</hi> is not in your judgement, a <hi>temporarie,</hi> but a <hi>perpetuall conſequent</hi> of <hi>Pearth Articles.</hi> For yee thinke it will ever ſcandalize the <hi>Papists,</hi> as if we were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:499:23"/>
approaching to them: Lykewyſe yee thinke everie one of them, and eſpeciallie <hi>Kneeling,</hi> to bee <hi>inductiue to ſinne, ex conditione operis,</hi> by the verie nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the worke it ſelfe. Whence it followeth, that they are neceſſarilie and immutablie ſcandalous; for what-ſo-ever agreeth to anie thing, in reſpect of the nature of it, it agreeth to it neceſſarilie and immutablie. If therefore wee in this reſpect, ſweare <hi>the forbearance of Pearth Articles,</hi> wee ſhall bee holden to forbeare <hi>Pearth Articles,</hi> not for a tyme, but for ever.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Next, wee pray you conſider, what is meaned by the <hi>foreſayde Novations,</hi> in that part of your <hi>Covenant,</hi> wherein yee promiſe to labour to recover the <hi>Libertie</hi> and <hi>Puritie</hi> of the <hi>Gospell, as it was before the foreſayde Novations.</hi> Certaynlie theſe wordes can not bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of <hi>Novations to bee introduced,</hi> and which haue not as yet entred vnto our Church. For the <hi>Libertie</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Puritie</hi> of the Church is not as yet loſt, yea, not impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them, and ſo needeth not to bee recovered by the removing of them. They muſt then be vnderſtood of the <hi>Novations</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Parentheſis</hi> of your <hi>Covenant</hi>; that, is of all <hi>Innovations alreadie introduced</hi> by <hi>Authoritie,</hi> and their alleadged <hi>Conſequentes,</hi> which yee promiſe to forbeare, vntill they bee allowed, and tryed by a free <hi>Aſſemblie.</hi> Hence anie man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that altho in your <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> yee promiſe onlie <hi>to forbeare theſe Novations for a tyme,</hi> yet in the wordes immediatelie following, yee condemne and abjure them. For the recovering of the <hi>Libertie</hi> and <hi>Puritie</hi> of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> as it was eſtabliſhed before the foreſayde <hi>Novations,</hi> importeth manifeſtlie a removing of all theſe <hi>Novations,</hi> which eyther in themſelues, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their conſequents, are contrarie to the <hi>Puritie</hi> and <hi>Libertie</hi> of the <hi>Gospell.</hi> But all <hi>Novations</hi> alreadie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, are in your judgement of this kynde, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:499:23"/>
there-fore your <hi>Vowe,</hi> of the <hi>Recovering the Libertie and Puritie of the GOSPELL,</hi> importeth a removing of all the fore-ſayde <hi>Novations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. To conclude this <hi>Argument</hi>: Yee may ſee, that wee haue pryed no more narrowlie into the expreſſions of your <hi>COVENANT,</hi> than wee had reaſon; and haue laboured, not to ſcarre our ſelues, and others, with meere ſhadowes, as yee affirme.</p>

                  <head>Of our <hi>ARGVMENT, Ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> and the weake <hi>Retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of it, by the <hi>Anſweres.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="17">17. Nowe wee come to our <hi>Argument,</hi> or <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme,</hi> AD HOMINEM, which hath ſo pinched you, that yee haue not attempted to anſwere to anie of the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> of it. Our intention in that <hi>Argument,</hi> was to proue, that whether <hi>Pearth Articles</hi> bee abjured in the <hi>Late Covenant,</hi> or not; Yet yee (who came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to giue vs ſatisfaction concerning the <hi>Covenant</hi>) can not, with a ſafe conſcience, averre, or declare to vs, that they are not abjured in it. This wee did evidentlie proue, reaſoning thus: What-ſo-ever <hi>Rites</hi> are abjured in the <hi>Olde Covenant,</hi> they are alſo, in your judgement, abjured in the <hi>Late Covenant.</hi> But <hi>Pearth Articles,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> are, in your judgement, abjured in the <hi>Olde Covenant:</hi> ERGO, they are, in your judgement, abjured in the <hi>Late Covenant</hi>: and, conſequentlie, if yee deale ſincerelie with vs, ye muſt averre, that they are alſo abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the <hi>Late Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. To this yee ſay, firſt, that what-ſo-ever be your judgement, as yee are <hi>particular perſons,</hi> yet, at this tyme,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:499:24"/>
yee were to bee taken, as <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> from the whole <hi>Companie</hi> of <hi>Subſcrybers.</hi> Truelie wee did take you ſo; and did thinke, that yee who were <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> from ſuch a <hi>Multitude</hi> of good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> would haue tolde vs your mynde ſincerelie, concerning the full extent of the <hi>Late Covenant</hi>; and, that yee would neyther haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed anie thing as <hi>Commiſsioners,</hi> which yee doe not thinke to bee true, as yee are <hi>particular perſons</hi>; nor yet would haue laboured, ſo to inſnare vs, as to haue bidden vs ſubſcrybe a <hi>Covenant,</hi> reallie, and indeede, in your judgement, abjuring thoſe thinges, which wee, with a ſafe conſcience, can not abjure.

Before wee leaue this poynt, that it may bee knowne to all, what reaſon wee haue to inſiſt in this our <hi>Argument,</hi> AD HOMINEM, and that wee haue proponed it, not to catch advantage of you, but to get ſatisfaction to our owne myndes, concerning the <hi>COVENANT,</hi> and your ſinceritie in vrging vs to Subſcrybe it, wee will collect out of that which hath bene alreadie ſayd, ſome INTERROGATORIES, which wee pray you to anſwere punctuallie, if yee intende to giue vs ſatisfaction. The firſt is, Whether or not your declaration of the extent of the <hi>LATE COVEMANT,</hi> to wit, that it extendeth not it ſelfe to the abjuration of <hi>Pearth Articles,</hi> bee not onlie VERA, true in it ſelfe, but alſo VERAX, that is, conſonant to your mynde, and to the mynde of the chiefe Contryvers of it?

Ye bring 2 <hi>Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,</hi> to proue the lawfulnes of the <hi>forbearance of Novations alreadie introduced.</hi> One is, that <hi>the Articles</hi> of <hi>Pearth</hi> eſtabliſhing them, <hi>were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded onlie for ſatisfying the King, and not to preſſe anie man with the practiſe of them</hi>: And <hi>becauſe the</hi> Act <hi>it ſelfe (yee meane the</hi> Act <hi>concerning</hi> Kneeling) <hi>giveth warrand, to forbeare the practiſe of them at this tyme, when the memorie of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition is revived.</hi> But this reaſon doeth no wayes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our conſciences.

The Author of the <hi>Diſpute</hi> even now cited, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth for his opinion, ſome Schoole-men, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the trueth of it: and hee nameth <hi>Cajetane,</hi> and <hi>Bannez,</hi> who (ſayeth hee) affirme, that wee ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne, even <hi>a ſpiritualibus non neceſſariis,</hi> when <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> aryſeth out of them. Hee might haue cited for this tenet, <hi>Thomas,</hi> and all his <hi>Interpreters,</hi> (even altho hee had beene but ſlenderlie acquaynt with them) as well as theſe two: For they all doe ſay ſo.

For, firſt, none of them ever taught, that wee ought <hi>to abſtayne totallie and altogether,</hi> from anie ſpirituall duetie for the <hi>Scandall,</hi> eyther of the weake, or malicious.

But ſo it is, yee would haue vs to reſolue, yea, to promiſe, and ſweare, not to practiſe <hi>Pearth Articles,</hi> vntill they bee tryed in a <hi>New Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie,</hi> and eſtabliſhed by a <hi>New Parliament</hi>: ERGO, yee would haue vs to promiſe, not to practiſe <hi>Perth articles,</hi> except wee bee tyed, or obliedged, by <hi>New Lawes,</hi> to practiſe them: and, conſequentlie. would haue vs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to regarde, or obey, the <hi>Actes</hi> of <hi>Pearth Aſſemblie,</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> 1621.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. This kynde of forbearance, to wit, which is conjoyned with a playne diſclayming of the authoritie of the <hi>Lawes</hi> made by our <hi>Superioures,</hi> can not bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed with your pretence of <hi>Scandall</hi> cauſeleſlie taken. This wee proue: Firſt, by a poſition granted by your ſelues, and ſo evidentlie true, that no man can denye it. The Author of the <hi>Diſpute,</hi> agaynſt <hi>Engliſh Popiſh</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. ſayeth, That <hi>it were</hi> Scandall, <hi>not to obey thb Lawes of the Church, when they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:499:32"/>
preſcrybe thinges neceſſarie, or expedient for the eſchewing of</hi> Scandall: <hi>And, that it were contempt, to refuſe obedience to the Lawes of the Church, when wee are not certaynlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, of the vnlawfulneſſe or inexpediencie of things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi> Now, if ſuch a refuſing of obedience, bee both a <hi>Contempt,</hi> and a <hi>Scandall,</hi> it followeth manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that no man for eſchewing of <hi>Scandall</hi> cauſeleſlie taken, ought in ſuch a caſe to refuſe obedience. Hence wee reaſon thus: who-ſo-ever are not perſwaded of the vnlawfulneſſe or inexpediencie, of the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by their <hi>Superioures</hi>; and on the contrare thinke them to bee expedient <hi>ad vitandum Scandalum</hi>; theſe ought not for eſchewing of <hi>Scandall,</hi> refuſe obedience to the lawes and ordinances of their <hi>Superioures.</hi> But ſo it is, wee are neyther perſwaded of the vnlawfulneſſe, nor of the inexpediencie of <hi>Pearth Articles</hi>: yea, on the contrarie, wee thinke that the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Pearth Aſſemblie,</hi> enjoyneth thinges verie expedient for eſchewing of <hi>Scandall</hi>: ERGO, wee ought not for eſchewing of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> cauſeleſlie taken, to refuſe obedience to them. The <hi>Major</hi> of this our firſt <hi>Argument,</hi> is alreadie proven. The <hi>Minor</hi> is conforme to the light of our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as GOD knoweth: and therefore ſo long as wee are of this mynde, wee can not denye obedience to the ordinances of our <hi>Superioures,</hi> for anie feare of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall cauſeleſlie taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="37">37. Secondlie, that which may bee removed by information or inſtruction, can not bee a warrand to vs, of a <hi>totall abſtinence</hi> from the obedience of <hi>Lawes,</hi> or, which is all one, of an avowed diſclayming of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of them. But the <hi>Scandall</hi> of the weake, taken by the practiſe of <hi>Pearth Articles,</hi> may bee removed by information, or inſtruction: ERGO, it can not bee a warrand to vs, of a totall diſclayming of the Authoritie of the <hi>Laws,</hi> whereby theſe <hi>Articles</hi> were eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="38">
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:499:32"/>38. Thirdlie: If for <hi>Scandalls</hi> taken, eſpeciallie by the <hi>Malicious,</hi> wee may diſclayme the Authoritie of a <hi>Law,</hi> then wee may ever diſclayme the Authoritie of all <hi>Lawes,</hi> of the Church or Eſtate. For there is nothing commanded by <hi>Lawes,</hi> but ſome, eyther through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or through malice, may take offence at it.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. Fourthlie, Wee ought not for eſchewing <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall cauſeleſlie taken,</hi> to injure or offend anie man, by denying to him, that which is due to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ought not, for eſchewing <hi>Scandall cauſeleſlie taken,</hi> to offend and injure our <hi>Superioures,</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Policie,</hi> by denying to them that obedience which is due to them. The antecedent is cleare by manie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. For if a man bee Excommunicated, ſhall his Wyfe, Children, and Servants flee his companie, and ſo denye to him theſe dueties which they owe to him, for feare that others bee <hi>Scandalized,</hi> by their keeping of companie with an Excommunicate Perſon? And if they may not for eſchewing of <hi>Scandall,</hi> abſtayne from theſe dueties, which they owe to a private perſon, much leſſe may wee abſtayne from that obedience, which we owe to our <hi>Superioures,</hi> having publicke charges in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Policie,</hi> for eſchewing of <hi>Scandals</hi> cauſeleſlie taken by others.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. Fiftlie, What if the thing commanded, bee enjoyned by the civill Magiſtrate, vnder payne of death, and by Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Authoritie,</hi> vnder payne of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, ſhall wee for feare of a <hi>Scandall cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſlie taken,</hi> which may bee removed by information, or for the <hi>Scandall</hi> of the malicious, who will not bee informed at all, abſtayne from the doing of a thing lawfull and expedient, enjoyned by <hi>Authoritie,</hi> and by ſo doing, incurre theſe moſt grievous puniſhments of Death Temporall, and Spirituall? Wee belieue, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:499:33"/>
your ſelues, who ſpeake moſt of <hi>Scandall,</hi> would bee loath to take ſuch a yoke vpon you.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. Sixtlie, The denying of obedience, to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full commandements of our <hi>Superioures,</hi> is forbidden in the fift COMMANDEMENT, and conſequentlie it is a ſinne. Shall wee then for a <hi>Scandall cauſeleſlie taken,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye obedience to our <hi>Superioures,</hi> and ſo incurre the guiltineſſ of ſinne? Yee commonlie anſwere to this, that the <hi>Negatiue Part</hi> of the fift COMMANDEMENT, which forbiddeth <hi>the reſiſting of the power,</hi> ROM. 13. VERS 2. and in generall the denying of obedience to <hi>Superioures,</hi> is to bee vnderſtood <hi>with the exception of the caſe of anie</hi> Scandall <hi>taken by others.</hi> For if wee ſee, (ſay yee) that anie may, or will take offence, at the doing of that which is commanded by our <hi>Superioures,</hi> wee are not holden to obey them: and our denying of obedience to them in ſuch a caſe, is not forbidden in that COMMANDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. But, firſt, wee aske, what warrand yee haue to ſay, that the <hi>negatiue part</hi> of the fift Commaundement, is to bee vnderſtoode <hi>with the exception of the caſe of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,</hi> more than other <hi>negatiue Preceptes</hi> of the ſecond Table? Secondlie: As men may take offence, eyther though <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> or <hi>malice,</hi> at our doing of the thing commaunded; ſo they are moſte readie to ſtumble at our denying of <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>lawfull Commaundementes</hi> of our <hi>Superioures</hi>: For they will take occaſion, by our carriage, to doe that, vnto which by nature, they are moſte enclyned; to wit, to vilipende <hi>Lawes,</hi> and the <hi>Authoritie</hi> of their <hi>Superioures.</hi> Shall wee, then, for the <hi>eſchewing</hi> of a <hi>Scandall cauſeleſlie taken,</hi> not onelie refuſe to our <hi>Superioures,</hi> the duetie of <hi>Obedience,</hi> which they craue of vs; but alſo incurre an other <hi>Scandall,</hi> and that a farre more perilous one. Thirdlie: Wee haue alreadie
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:499:33"/>
ſhowne, that the <hi>negatiue parte</hi> of the fift Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, is not allwayes to bee vnderſtoode with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the caſe of <hi>Scandall cauſeleſlie taken.</hi> For, Wyues, Children, and Servantes, muſt not denye <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and familiar converſation to their Husbandes, Parentes, and Maſters, which are excommunicated, for feare that others, through <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> or <hi>malice,</hi> bee ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized there-at. Fourthly: As yee ſaye, that the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> concerning <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Superioures,</hi> is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode with the <hi>exception of the caſe of Scandall cauſeleſlie taken</hi>; ſo wee, with farre better <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ſaye, that the <hi>Precept,</hi> of <hi>eſchewing Scandall cauſeleſlie taken,</hi> is to bee vnderſtoode with <hi>the exception of the caſe of Obedience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorlie requyred,</hi> by our <hi>lawfull Superioures,</hi> as wee ſhall ſhowe in our next <hi>Argument.</hi>

men ordinarilie are divyded in judgement, concerning the expediencie of theſe thinges.

                  <p n="48">48. Seeing, then, what-ſo-ever yee haue hither-to ſayde, concerning the <hi>Question</hi> proponed by vs, may bee eaſilie aunſwered, with a <hi>retortion</hi> of the <hi>Argument,</hi> vpon your ſelues; that wee may eſchewe all ſuch <hi>Logo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machie,</hi> wee muſt take ſome other courſe, and trye which of theſe two <hi>Preceptes</hi> is in it ſelfe of greater <hi>moment,</hi> and <hi>obligation:</hi> for thence wee may collect, which of theſe two <hi>Preceptes</hi> doeth obliedge vs in the caſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde; the other giving place to it, and not obliedging vs at all, in that caſe. If yee ſay, that the <hi>Precept</hi> which forbiddeth vs to doe that <hi>where-by our weake brother may bee ſcandalized,</hi> is in it ſelfe more <hi>obligatorie,</hi> or doeth more ſtrictlie tye vs to the obedience of it, as beeing of greater <hi>moment,</hi> yee muſt bring a ſolid <hi>Reaſon</hi> for you, which wee thinke yee will hardlie finde. Wee knowe yee ſaye, that the <hi>Precept</hi> concerning <hi>Scandall,</hi> is more <hi>obligatorie,</hi> and of greater <hi>moment</hi>; becauſe it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>the loſſe of the ſoule of a Brother</hi>: But this <hi>Reaſon</hi> is not valide; firſt, in reſpect our Brother, if hee bee ſcandalized, by our <hi>Obedience</hi> to our <hi>Superioures,</hi> ſinneth not by our default, who doe obey: For our carriage, in giving <hi>Obedience,</hi> is ſuch, as may rather <hi>aedifie</hi> our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Secondlie: The <hi>Precept</hi> which forbiddeth <hi>Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> concerneth <hi>the loſſe both of our owne ſoules, and of the ſoules of others,</hi> who may bee entyſed to that ſin, by our denying <hi>Obedience,</hi> to the lawfull commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our <hi>Superiours.</hi> Thirdlie. If that <hi>Praecept</hi> of <hi>eſchewing Scandall, cauſeleſlie taken,</hi> doe ſo ſtrictlie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liedge vs, when our <hi>Superioures</hi> requyre <hi>Obedience</hi> of vs, it may happen, that a man ſhall bee in an inextricable perplexitie, not knowing whether hee ſhall obey, or denye <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Commandements</hi> of his <hi>Superioures</hi>:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:499:36"/>
in reſpect hee may feare the <hi>Scandall of the weake,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee obey, or denye <hi>Obedience.</hi> For, as wee ſayde before, manie are moſt readie to bee <hi>Scandalized</hi> by our denying of <hi>Obedience</hi> to our <hi>Superioures,</hi> in thinges law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and otherwyſe expedient: and that becauſe wee by nature are moſt vnwilling to bee curbed, and to haue our <hi>Libertie</hi> reſtrayned, by the <hi>Lawes</hi> of our <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioures.</hi> For this cauſe (as <hi>Calvin</hi> judiciouſlie noteth, <hi>Inſtit.

GOD to allure vs to the duetie of <hi>Obedience</hi> to our <hi>Superiouree,</hi> called all <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioures, Parentes,</hi> in the fift COMMANDEMENT.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. But wee, with good warrand, doe averre, that the <hi>Precept</hi> which forbiddeth reſiſting of the <hi>Civill</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and in generall the denying of <hi>Obedience</hi> to the lawfull <hi>Commandements</hi> of our <hi>Superioures,</hi> is of greater obligation and moment. And, firſt, wee proue this by an <hi>Argument</hi> taken from the dyverſe degrees of that care, which wee ought to haue of the Salvation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for this care tyeth vs to three thinges; to wit, firſt, to the doing of that which may be aedificatiue, and maye giue a good example to all. Secondlie: to the eſchewing of that which may bee <hi>Scandalous,</hi> or an evill example to all; that is, to the eſchewing of everie thing, which is eyther ſinne, or hath a manifeſt ſhowe of ſinne. Thirdlie: To abſtayne even from that, which altho it bee lawfull, yet it may bee, to ſome particular perſons, an occaſion of ſinne. Of theſe, the firſt two are moſt to bee regarded, in reſpect they concerne the good of all, which is to bee preferred to the good of particular perſons. Hence wee inferre that the <hi>Precept</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Superioures,</hi> which preſcrybeth an <hi>Act</hi> aedificatiue to all, becauſe it is an exerciſe of a moſte eminent and neceſſarie vertue, is more obligatorie, and of greater moment, than the <hi>Precept</hi> of eſchewing <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:499:37"/>
cauſeleſlie taken, by ſome particular perſons.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. Secondlie: That the <hi>Praecept</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to our <hi>Superioures,</hi> is of greater Moment, and conſequentlie more obligatorie, than the <hi>Precept</hi> of eſchewing <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi>; is evident by theſe reaſons which are brought by our <hi>Divynes,</hi> to ſhow where-fore the fift <hi>Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> hath the firſt place in the ſecond Table: to wit, firſt, becauſe it commeth neareſt to the nature of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> or <hi>Pietie,</hi> commanded in the firſt Table, whence (as your owne <hi>Ameſius</hi> noteth in his <hi>Medulla, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 17. §. 13.) the honouring and obeying of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> is called by prophane Authors, <hi>Religion and Pietie.</hi> Secondlie: This <hi>Precept,</hi> is the ground and ſinewe, (ſayeth <hi>Pareus,</hi> in his <hi>Catecheticke</hi> explication of the fift <hi>Precept,</hi>) of the <hi>Obedience</hi> which is to bee given to all the reſt of the <hi>Precepts,</hi> of the ſecond Table. Two reaſons are commonlie brought of this: One is, that all Societies, oeconomicke, Civill and Eccleſiaſticall, doe conſiſt and are conſerved, by the ſubmiſſion or ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Inferioures to <hi>Superioures,</hi> which beeing remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, confuſion neceſſarilie followeth. The other is, that the <hi>Obedience</hi> of this <hi>Precept,</hi> maketh way to the <hi>Obedience</hi> of all the reſt. For our <hi>Superioures</hi> are ſet over vs, to the ende, that they may make vs to doe our due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to all others. And conſequentlie our <hi>Obedience</hi> to them, is a meane inſtituted by GOD, to procure our <hi>Obedience</hi> to all the reſt of the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the ſecond Table. Now, would yee know what followeth out of this, let your owne <hi>Ameſius,</hi> whoſe wordes are more gracious vnto you, than ours, tell you it: <hi>Seeing</hi> (ſayth he, <hi>Cap. citato,</hi> §. 6) <hi>humane ſocietie hath the place of a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or ground, in reſpect of other dueties, of Justice and Charitie, which are commanded in the ſecond Table of the</hi> Law: <hi>therefore theſe crymes which directlie procure the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:499:37"/>
confuſion, and everſion of it, are more grievous than the violations of the ſingular</hi> Praecepts. Now we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume: the denying of <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Superioures,</hi> injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch thinges as in them-ſelues are lawfull and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, directlie procureth the perturbation and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of humane ſocietie. And therefore it is a cryme greater than the violation of other particular <hi>Praecepts</hi> of the ſecond Table. For this cauſe, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Novatum,</hi> cited before, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring how much the vnitie of the <hi>Church</hi> (which is moſt frequentlie marred by the diſobedience of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioures to their <hi>Superioures,</hi>) ought to bee regarded, ſayeth, <hi>that Martyrdome ſuffered for eſchewing of</hi> Schiſme, <hi>is more glorious, than Martyrdome ſuffered for eſchewing</hi> Idolatrie.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. Thirdlie: Theſe offices, or dueties, which wee owe to others, <hi>by way of Justice,</hi> are more ſtrictlie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatorie, than theſe which wee owe to them, <hi>onelie by way of Charitie.</hi> And conſequentlie, theſe <hi>Praecepts</hi> which preſcrybe <hi>Dueties of Justice,</hi> are of greater obligation, than theſe which preſcrybe <hi>Dueties of Charitie onelie.</hi> But wee owe the duetie of <hi>Obedience</hi> to our <hi>Superiours,</hi> by way of <hi>Justice,</hi> and therefore it is more obligatorie, than the duetie of eſchewing <hi>Scandall cauſleſlie taken,</hi> which is a duetie onlie of <hi>Charitie.</hi> The <hi>Major,</hi> or firſt propoſition of this <hi>Argument,</hi> is cleare of it ſelfe, as beeing a <hi>Maxime</hi> not onelie receaved by the Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtickes and <hi>Popiſh Caſuiſts</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo by our <hi>Divynes.</hi> See your owne <hi>Ameſius,</hi> in his <hi>Medulla; Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. §. 58.59.60.61.62.63. where hee not onlie propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this <hi>Maxime,</hi> but alſo proveth it by two moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent examples. The <hi>Minor</hi> is lykewyſe cleare: For, firſt, the duetie of <hi>Obedience,</hi> which wee owe to the publicke <hi>Lawes</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdome,</hi> belongeth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:499:38"/>
to that <hi>Generall Juſtice,</hi> which is called <hi>Juſtitia legalis.</hi> For the legall juſtice, as it is in Inferiours, or Subjects, it is a vertue inclyning them to the <hi>Obedience</hi> of all <hi>Lawes,</hi> made for the benefite of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> declareth in his 5 Booke of the <hi>Ethickes, Cap.</hi> 1. Secondlie: <hi>Debitum obedientiae,</hi> the debt of <hi>Obedience,</hi> which wee owe to our <hi>Superioures,</hi> is not onlie <hi>debitum morale,</hi> a debt or duetie, vnto which wee are tyed by <hi>morall honeſtie,</hi> and GOD'S commandement, but alſo <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum legale,</hi> or <hi>debitum juſtitiae, (quod viz. fundatur in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio jure alterius)</hi> a debt grounded vpon the true and proper right, which our <hi>Superioures</hi> haue to exact this duetie of vs; ſo that they may accuſe vs of injurie, and cenſure vs, if wee performe it not. There is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt theſe two ſorts of debt; and the laſt is farre more obligatorie, than the firſt: As for example, A man oweth moneys to the poore, by a <hi>morall debt,</hi> but to his creditor hee oweth them by a <hi>legall debt,</hi> or <hi>debt of juſtice</hi>: And therefore, hee is more ſtrictlie oblieged to pay his creditor, than to giue almes. Such-lyke, by <hi>morall honeſtie,</hi> and GOD'S precept alſo, a man oweth to his neyghbour, a pious carefulneſſe, to impede ſinne in him, by admonition, inſtruction, good example, and by omiſſion even of thinges lawfull, when hee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth that his neyghbour in reſpect of his weakneſſe, will bee ſcandalized by them. But his neyghbour hath not ſuch a right to exact theſe thinges of him, neyther can hee haue action agaynſt him, for not performing of them, as our lawfull <hi>Superioures</hi> haue for our due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

But judicious and Learned men, even then thought the denying of theſe Sacramentes to perſons, who can not come, or bee brought to the <hi>Church,</hi> to bee a reſtrayning of the meanes of grace, altogether vnwarrandable by GOD'S word.

The meaning of the Act of the Aſſemblie of <hi>Pearth,</hi> citing the wordes of the PSALME 95, is not (as yee doe interpret it) anie perverting of the Text, neyther tendeth it to inferre there-vpon, abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of <hi>Kneeling,</hi> in all worſhipping of GOD, or in this part of His worſhip, in the celebration of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <hi>Communion</hi>: but onlie to inferre the Lawfullneſſe, and commendable Decencie of Kneeling, in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and that it is ſuch a Geſture, as our lawfull Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioures may enjoyne to bee vſed, in GOD'S Worſhip; and that Religious Adoration, and Kneeling, is to bee done to GOD onelie, altho they ſinne not, who vſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Geſture, where this is not requyred by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but another appoynted, or permitted.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Yee ſay, firſt, That wee haue taken <hi>an ample Teſtimonie</hi> to our ſelues. But what, wee pray you, haue wee <hi>teſtified of our ſelues</hi>; but this onlie, that in ſincere and zealous profeſſion of the <hi>Trueth,</hi> wee are not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to others; and, according to our meaſure, haue ſtriven to bee faythfuil in all the dueties of our Calling?

For, as yee are loath to ſpeake anie good of vs; ſo yee would haue the Reader belieue, that wee ſpeake too much good of our ſelues.

(as if yee had never heard our Paynes and Labours, for the Trueth, commended by anie) who knoweth not, but in this caſe, in the which we ſtand for the preſent, it is lawfull, and moſte expedient to men, to vindicate them-ſelues, and their Fidelitie in their Callinges, from the contempt and Calumnies of others. Wee haue in the Scriptures, notable Examples of GGD'S deareſt Saynctes, who in ſuch caſes, yea, in other caſes alſo, without anie derogation, to their ſingular humilitie, did fall out into high expreſſions, of their owne vertuous and pious carriage.

               <p>YEE repeate your former Anſwere, concerning your Interpretation of the clauſe of forbearance, which wee haue allreadie refuted in our former REPLYES, neyther doe yee bring heere anie new confirmation thereof: And therefore all the three <hi>Scandals,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in our 13 DEMAND, doe yet remayne vnremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Altho your Interpretation were admitted, which wee can not admit, yet at leaſt the third <hi>Scandall</hi> were no wayes avoydable there-by, (what-ſo-ever may bee ſuppoſed concerning the other two,) and that becauſe of the reaſon expreſſed in our 13 REPLYE; to which your Anſweres heere are not ſatisfactorie. 1. Yee doe inſinuate, that yee thinke our Oath of obedience to our Ordinarie, and <hi>Pearth</hi> Conſtitutions, not lawfull in it ſelfe: which wee are perſwaded is verie lawfull. 2. Yee would ſeeme to inferre the vnlawfulneſſe of it, by chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging, <hi>the Authoritie where-by it was exacted</hi>; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging that <hi>there is no ordinance made Civill or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke, appoynting anie ſuch Oath.</hi> This reaſon (altho it were granted) hath no ſtrength at all, to prooue that which yee intende, to wit, that eyther our Oath is in it ſelfe vnlawfull, or that wee may now lawfullie breake it: for our ſwearing of that Oath is not agaynſt anie lawfull <hi>Authoritie,</hi> eyther divyne or humane: and in ſuch a caſe, Oathes concerning thinges lawfull, ought to bee keeped, whether they bee requyred by appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a publicke ordinance, or not: which who-ſo-ever denyeth, hee openeth a patent doore to the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of lawfull Oathes, in Matrimoniall and civill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and manie other caſes, daylie incident in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

converſation. Alſo the exacting of that Oath, was clearlie warranded by two <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> viz. <hi>Parliament</hi> 21, of King IAMES the 6, holden at EDIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BVRGH, Anno 1612. CHAP. 1. and <hi>Parliament</hi> 23. of King IAMES the 6, holden at EDINBVRGH, Anno 1621. <hi>Act</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yee take vpon you to call in queſtion, <hi>with what conſcience that Oath was given.</hi> How oft, Brethren, ſhall wee exhort you to forbeare judging of other mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which are knowne to GOD onlie? <hi>Judge not, that yee bee not judged.</hi> MATTH. 7, 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yee alleadge, wee <hi>can not anſwere before a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſemblie for our Oath, and the Scandall riſen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon.</hi> No man needeth to bee aſhamed, before a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſemblie,</hi> or anie other <hi>Judicatorie,</hi> of his lawfull and due obedience, which hee hath given to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Conſtitutions of the Church of SCOTLAND, and to his Majeſties ſtanding Lawes; or of anie lawfull Oath, where-by hee hath promiſed that obedience. As for the <hi>Scandall,</hi> it was not given by vs, but vnneceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and vnjuſtlie taken, by you, and ſome others, vpon an erronious opinion, obſtinatelie mayntayned agaynſt the lawfulneſſe of the matters themſelues.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yee ſay, That <hi>conceaving the Oath, according to our owne groundes, none of vs will ſay, that wee haue ſworne the perpetuall approbation and practiſe of theſe things, which wee eſteeme to bee indifferent, what-ſo-ever bad conſequent of</hi> Poperie, Idolatrie, Superſtition, <hi>or</hi> Scandall, <hi>ſhould follow there-vpon.</hi> Wee anſwere, 1. Theſe bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentes are alleadged by you, but not proven. 2. Evils of that kynde ſhould bee avoyded, by ſome lawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. And wee doe not eſteeme it lawfull for vs, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey <hi>Authoritie</hi> in thinges lawfull, altho in themſelues
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:499:62"/>
indifferent: for obedience commanded by the fift Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Decalogue, is not a thing indifferent. There bee other meanes which are lawfull and more effectuall agaynſt ſuch evills, as wee haue ſpecified in our eleventh REPLYE: 3. Wee did not ſweare perpetuall approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and practiſe of indifferent thinges; but knowing theſe thinges in them ſelues, to bee approvable, wee did ſweare obedience to the publicke Lawes, requyring our practiſe in theſe thinges, ſo long as the Lawe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in vigour, and our obedience there-to is requyred by our lawfull Superioures. 4. This courſe wee holde to bee more agreeable to our duetie, than vpon private conceptions of <hi>Scandals</hi> vnneceſſarilie taken, to breake off our due obedience to that <hi>Authoritie</hi> which GOD hath ſet over vs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Out of our aſſertion (Replye 4.) concerning the adminiſtration of the Sacraments in private places, to ſicke perſons, in caſe of neceſſitie, yee doe collect, that wee <hi>can not forbeare the practiſe of theſe, altho our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, and other lawfull Superioures ſhould will vs to doe ſo.</hi> And hence yee inferre, <hi>that heere-in</hi> Pearth Aſſemblie, <hi>for which wee ſtand, is wronged by vs two wayes</hi>: 1. <hi>That wee differ in judgement from them, about the indifferencie of the fiue Articles: and next, that at the will of our Ordinarie, and yee know not what other lawfull Superioures, wee are readie to forbeare the practiſe of theſe thinges, which the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie hath appoynted to bee obſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. As for your mayne Queſtion, <hi>Whether a duetie neceſſarie by Divine Lawe, may bee, or may not bee omitted, in caſe, our Ordinarie, and other lawfull Superioures, ſhould will vs to omit it</hi>? before wee aunſwere to it, wee muſt expound what wee meane by <hi>our other lawfull Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioures,</hi> becauſe of your jeſting pretence of ignorance heere-of. Wee meane heere-by, The King's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,

the Parliament, the Secret Counſell, and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies, where-vnto wee owe Obedience in our Practiſe requyred by them, according to publicke Lawes.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Queſtion it ſelfe ye doe expreſſe more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in your Aunſwere to our fourth Replye; where yee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, that <hi>wee finde ſome of the</hi> PEARTH ARTICLES <hi>ſo neceſſarie, that altho the Generall Aſſemblie of the Church ſhould diſcharge them, yet wee behoved ſtill, for conſcience of the Commaundement of GOD, to practiſe them.</hi>
