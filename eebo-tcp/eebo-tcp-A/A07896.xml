         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore he was of women

And beeing one day walking for

garde &amp; gouerne Princes. Sure, if I
should say so much of Learning, as if
libertie would permit I could be wel
conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to discourse: my tongue should
not waxe so wearie, as your eares
woulde bee desirous to heare the
depthe of suche a tale. For to
Learning, is not onely the charge
of the Common wealth committed:
<pb facs="tcp:21299:11"/>
but also there dependeth therevpon
the deuine direction, and sauegarde
to mans soule. Without learning
there could be no Lawe, without
Lawe no L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue, yea and without
Looue no life: So that Learning by
Lawe dooth rather maintayne Looue,
then Looue by Lawe maintaine lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Beside, I could tell of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which by learning haue béene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced
to honnor, whereas yet by
Looue I haue heard of very few. For
what was euer with the <hi>Romaines</hi>
so much in estimation as Learning?
allwayes the Senate was supplyed
with singuler Schollers, they regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not the value but the vertue: so
that Learning found there more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
then Looue.<note place="margin">Heere was wunne wealth by wisdome.</note> A simple Shéepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards

a <hi>Praetor,</hi> yea or rather <hi>Dictator</hi>
of <hi>Roome.</hi> How many Clownes
haue béene brought to the like hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
by Looue? if none, then Madame
you are to be loouing subiect to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to whom I giue the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignetie.
<pb facs="tcp:21299:11"/>
And as for Looue, this I
pronounce, it is generally vice,
though a perticular vertue, and sure
a very méere vanitye; better to be
wanted then wished: for by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
aswell sacred as prophane, there is
lefte to vs a memorie of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
mischeifes, that thereby haue
chaunced. And therefore (Madame)
my aunswer is this, Learning excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
Looue, if to the contrarye you
thinke your selfe able to defend my
argument: you here haue libertye to
prooue at your pleasure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ladie.</speaker>
               <p>I thanke you for it, but I perceaue
if I were so ignoraunt, that I could
not my selfe define on such a doubt: I
were much the better to referre my
want to your wisedome, for you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
but you will not allowe: either
you déeme me too simple to compare
with your skill, or my wit too weake
to counteruaile your wisedome. But
Sir, surmise you now dispute with a
Dame, and not a Docter: as I am
<pb facs="tcp:21299:12"/>
not altogether a Sophister, so thinke
me not so ignoraunt: but that I can
sounde the depthe of a greater doubte
then I haue yet demaunded. And
whereas you rather infer the praise
onely to Learning and not to Looue:
I wil prooue that Looue in a publique
weale, is to be allowed abooue Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
and Learning more better to
be spared then Looue. Firste consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that Looue is no particuler pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie:
but that the same is generall
and common to all liuing creatures,
but of humanitie moste honoured.
Secondly consider the originall from
whence Looue taketh his beginning.
And lastely,<note place="margin">Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie in a woman.</note> scanne the sence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the simple meaning: and then
tell me how great a matter is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this little woord Looue. You
wil not deny, but by nature men are
learned to looue, and by Looue, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had her beginning. How can it
then bee chosen, but Looue héerein
was Schoolemaister to Learning:
séeing the originall was Looue
<pb facs="tcp:21299:12"/>
by Nature? which brought foorth
Schollers though not traynde in
Schooles.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholler.</speaker>
               <p>Not so, for as Looue at the firste
was rather Subiect vnto Nature,
then either Nature or Looue a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
vnto Learning: so time héerein
was to be preferred before either.<note place="margin">Theology.</note>
For time brought foorth Nature, and
Nature engendred Looue, of Looue
came Lawe, and of Lawe Learning.
So that I saye, learning had his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
from the beginning, and
Looue by the diuine substaunce of the
Deity, gaue aide to Nature: which
after made Looue a Schoolemaister,
and Learning a Scholler. But how?
that men ought to looue Learning,
and not Learning to like of Looue.
For why? the discommodities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are so daungerous: as that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes,
Prophets, Princes, yea
and the moste notable Philosophers,
doo vtterly estéeme it as an enemie
to all vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21299:13"/>How many Princes, and other of as
great power, haue (by prophane and
sacred authority) béen seduced by this
deceitefull Looue? I reade of <hi>Sallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Dauid</hi> his Father,<note place="margin">Genesis.</note> yea <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and <hi>Lot,</hi> whom though all these
were chosen Uessels of the Lorde, yet
could they not but doate vpon this
vaine desire. And therfore, these haue
left behinde them, a staffe to leade the
ignorant, least as they did, they féele
the scourges of Follie. And yet <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
forgot Gods promise, &amp; doated
vpon <hi>Agar: Dauid</hi> earnestly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and <hi>Salomon</hi> when he perceiued
he had sinned, asked mercy of the
Lorde. Therefore I must appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
to them, that looue: thus saying.
<hi>Dulce bellum in expertis,</hi> Warre is
swéete to those that neuer felt it. And
so Madam is Looue, but his sauor is
sower.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ladie.</speaker>
               <p>You haue made a longe protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but I pray you tell me, if Looue
had not béene liked of such holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
<pb facs="tcp:21299:13"/>
whether had they hazarded
theyr soules or not, for so swéete a
sinne?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholler.</speaker>
               <p>I déeme that although by Nature
they sinned, hauing a lust rather to
flesh then faythe: yet by repentaunce
theyr sinne was but small, and that
theyr sinnes left vs a sacred Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
to eschew so vaine a delight as
Looue, which in the ende is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce.
As sayd <hi>Demostenes,</hi> when he

not ignoraunt of <hi>Flora,</hi> for that I
heard you name her of late, the life
of whom, though I wish not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend:
<pb facs="tcp:21299:24"/>
so will I not condemne her
wisedome, in the subtill Schooling
and Nurtering of her Pupils or
Schollers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FLora</hi> was of byrthe noble, of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
gentle, of personage beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and of Looue liberall, in so
much that ouer the place where she
dwelt, she set vp this scrole or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripte.
<hi>Except King Prince,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A large title.</note> 
                  <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
Praetor, Consull, Censor or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
heere is no place for any to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
As for Emperor or Keyser, they
were not then knowne, this was her
vse, she neuer set her honour like
<hi>Layes</hi> to salery: for <hi>Laies</hi> would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
haue her hyer before hande.
Now <hi>Flora</hi> had this fetch, she as not
respecting Goulde or Siluer, gaue
her selfe to be gouerned by her Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
And so by this meanes she got
treasure infinite, for why? this was
her common phrase, béeing one day
demaunded the cause by Noble men,
why she refused to aske what she
would haue, she aunswered thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21299:24"/>
I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit my selfe (quoth she) to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Noble men, that according to
my beautye, I may be pertaker of
their bounty. For (quoth she) by the
Gods whom I doo serue, there was
neuer man gaue me so little, but that
I had more then I lookt for, or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to my demaund. There ought
(quoth she) no sage woman to set her
selfe to sale, for all things in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world
are rated at a price, except Looue, and
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is not to be payed but with Looue:
so that none ought to demaund duety
for the amorous pleasure she dooth to
a man, but for the Looue she beareth
vnto him. This was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this
Courtezan, who though she were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
it was not so much for coyne as
courtesie. She sought to none, yet
was she sought of all. The learnedst
thought no shame to be her Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.
Then <hi>Ergo</hi> Looue was héere
more regardant then Learning whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Consuls &amp; Censores left all for lust &amp;
Looue of <hi>Flora.</hi> Whether was Wit

               <p>Sure Madame, you scan the sence
contrary, for though <hi>Flora</hi> found such
fortune, as that the wisest and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest
were bondmen vnto her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
yet she neuer held Learning in
subiection. Learning still had liberty
to triumphe ouer Looue, although the
learned were snared by her subtilty.
So that if Looue haue conquered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
blame the Booke bearer, and not
the Booke: for Learning it self neuer
yet hath nor will bende to beauty,
I stand vpon this oppinion.</p>

               <speaker>Ladie.</speaker>
               <p>Of trothe I beléeue you thinke your

not speake so obscure: but what fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
you take I know not, but wel I
note all your woords are <hi>per Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam.</hi>
But Sir according to my Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke,
I will approoue, that as long
as the Learned are liuing, they enioy
<pb facs="tcp:21299:25"/>
Learning, and the benefit thereof:
you cannot seperate them a sunder,
for conquere one and take bothe. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as a man should say, take my
heart and take my life, naming two
when one would suffise. Therefore
Sir, I say that if Loone subdue the
Learned, shee then is conqueror of
bothe: vnlesse you will make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
touching the person of the
one, and the property of the other,
and that you cannot, for that they
bothe are so faste lincked as nothing
can sunder them: therefore you erre,
if to the contrarye you conster the
case.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholler.</speaker>
               <p>Well, then I perceaue you will
haue it: either to what perfection you
please, or els you wyll not giue ouer.
And therefore as I remember,<note place="margin">Cornelius Suetonius.</note> 
                  <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
Suetonius</hi> sheweth a notable
example, to the vtter abollishing of
Looue, which you tearme amorous
or pleasau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pastimes: and for because
that you will not be perswaded, that
<pb facs="tcp:21299:26"/>
Looue can any way be reiected right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
I will now by example prooue
it to be so odious, as you your selfe
shall confesse it hath varyed from the
lawes of Nature: and this is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>THe Tirant <hi>Nero,</hi> who not onely

finding a beautifull Boye, more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
in his eyes then any other
Uirgin or woman: caused his secrets
to be spoyled, thinking thereby to
haue him transformed to his owne
pleasure, by such a Metamorphosis as
of a man to haue a woman. Not long
after he married him, naming him
<hi>Sporus,</hi> endowing him with such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
duties, as to a Wife are due by
dowry. Héere was lust more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law
of Nature, and yet it was Looue. But
I hope you will not allow this, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Nature was héere a foe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her selfe, in kindling so great a fire
in <hi>Nero,</hi> as could not be quenched
<pb facs="tcp:21299:26"/>
without such a cursed coniunction.
This Luste of <hi>Nero</hi> quite extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
the glory of Looue, and makes
the same so odious to the eares of
such as reade this tragedy: that men
rather séeke by reason to brydle such
fiery affections, then to be found ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with such pestilent passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
So that <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Suetoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
doo leaue their Learning, to be a
Lampe or Loadstone vnto our liues,
that though we séeke to be rather
thralle to Looue, then by Learning
to haue liberty: yet theyr counsell is
héerein to be ruled by Learning, and
not to raunge beyonde reason: so
that Learning is héere vtter enemy
to looue.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, sithe I am so farre
entred, I will yet make a farther
discourse of the vnnaturall Looue of
a Father to his owne Childe: that
the terror of the tale may giue light

                  </gap>we as one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand. Who labouring long
tyme vppon a pyle (as the Author
affirmeth) wasted so much wealthe:
as that he was not onely destitute,
but also desperate to comprehend the
same.<note place="margin">A father compelleth his owne daughter to liue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuiously.</note> And séeing by no meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the same could be finished but
onely by the meane of money, which
then he did want: He commeth to his
Daughter, and commaundeth her
earnestly to giue her selfe to sensuall
prostitution, menacing her not onely
to pitch a great price vpon her honor:
but also to embrace euery one that
<pb facs="tcp:21299:27"/>
brought to her commodity. Which
soone after she fulfilled, no lesse with
regarde to her owne profit, then also
to performe her promise to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For looke how many dealt or

the price thereof builded the <hi>Pirami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
a certaine hill which beareth on
the top one hundreth and fiftie foote.
This Looue you must néedes confesse
was neither good nor godly: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Learning in this place had béene
better then Looue. For then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue
expence of the father, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
sought the sale and the spoyle of
his owne séede: but héere was Luste
and no Learning, which forced folly

which in her sight she séeeth him to

is no torment or martirdome that
may be ministred to a man, but that

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>,
Liberallest, and Strongest that
euer was, is <hi>Iehoua,</hi> the onely maker
and creator of all thinges, who by
his wisdome made the worlde, and
in the same hath not onely planted
and placed all kinde of creatures:
but also made man, to be the onely
Lord of all creatures els liuing. So
that who may compare with his
<pb facs="tcp:21299:40"/>
wisedome? or who can comprehend
a woorke of such woonder?</p>
               <p>As touching now the Learnedst
that euer was, I likewise affirme
that the Learning and Lesson, which
he first taught our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi>
was so profound, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:
that all the Diuines in the
world, could neuer define the miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you confesse him to be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

néedes allow it. For what greater
Looue could he showe to man: then
firste to make him, béeing nothing
but slime, like to his moste glorious
and diuine Image. Secondly, when
man had transgressed, and was by the
Law condemned, how Loouingly sent
he, according to his promise, his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sonne our Sauiour, to paye our
raunsome, and to deliuer vs from
deathe and damnation. What Looue
was euer like to this? and yet this
Looue was meant to man, before the
beginning of the worlde.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21299:41"/>And now touching his liberallitie,
what Prince in the world from the
East to the West, hath power to doo
the like? Firste, he hath giuen vs
the world frankely to liue in, and all
the creatures therein contayned, to
be at our com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ndement: he féedes
vs, he cloathes vs, he prouides vs
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rbor, he hath giuen generally all
the world, and all things therein.
What can be more wished? or who
euer was so liberall? Lastely, the
strongest that euer was, like case
he is: for at his woorde, bothe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and the Earth shall faile, the
Mountaines fall, yea, and the Seas
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

So that our God is inuincible, and
his woorkes not to be wondred at,
but praysed.</p>
