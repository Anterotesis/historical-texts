         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

might ſerue not onely to offend, but alſo to ruine effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
all Policies, as well Ciuill as Eccleſiaſticall. There haue
bin found ſome vngodly perſons, which being ſo bold as
to ſpeake blaſphemie againſt heauen, haue employed their
Pens and ſwords againſt the Church which is the Bride of
Ieſus Chriſt. But ſome wicked men conſidering that the
Secular powers are not without reaſon armed with the
Sword, haue by an other manner of way ſet vpon the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
and haue tryed to extirpe, and annullate it by the
meanes of execrable bookes, executing their wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
more couertly by the meanes of ſuch embuſcados.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:3499:4"/>
The marke which Saint <hi>Iudas</hi> propoſeth vnto vs to know ſuch
perſons is, that they contemne the ſoueraigne powers, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
againſt the Maieſtie. It were to bee wiſhed, that they
reſted themſelues with their contemning andſpeaking ill; but it is
ſo farre from it, that to the contrary theſe damnable writers, vnder
the pretext to eſtabliſh in the Church a certaine temporall power,
they teach and affirme, that it is in the power of thoſe which gouerne
Eccleſiaſticall matters, to put Kings out of their Thrones, yea, euen
for ſmall and ridiculous matters, and to ſubſtitute in their places, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Soueraigne or annuall, yea, euen daily Magiſtrates, as they ſhall
thinke fit. Therefore the Diuines of the Vniuerſitieof <hi>Paris,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that they intend by ſuch meanes to ruine the Ciuill Policies,
and eſpecially the <hi>French</hi> Monarchie which is gouerned by our Moſt
Chriſtian, moſt Gracious, and moſt Iuſt King; they to follow the
ſteps of their predeceſſors haue to ſhew their affection which they
beare to his Maieſtie and all this Kingdome, and to ſatisfie the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
deſire of all good perſons choſen amongſt other a Booke which
is newly come to light, vnder the title of <hi>Antonij Sanctarelli Ieſuitae,
de Haereſi, Schiſmate Apoſtaſia, &amp;c.</hi> in the generall congregation
which hath extraordinarily beene kept on the ſixt day of the Moneth
of March which is laſt paſt, appointed ſome Doctors which they
haue particularly named to reade, and examine the ſame Booke. But
ſeeing that it treateth of many things which concerne not the matter
which is now principally queſtioned, and haue reſolued that but two
chapters of the ſame Booke ſhould be examined, namely, the 30. and
31. of the treatie of Hereſie.</p>
            <p>So it is that on the firſt day of the moneth of Aprill, in the yeare
1626. after the Maſſe of the Holy-Ghoſt, the aſſembly being made
according to cuſtome in the Hall of the Colledge of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi>
there was heard the report of the Doctors which were appointed by
the Diuines, and delared that in the two chapters which were ſhewn
vnto them, are contayned the following Propoſitions, namely, That
the Pope may puniſh the Kings and Princes with temporall paines,
and that he hath power to Depoſe and bereaue them of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and States for crime of Hereſie, and to diſcharge their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
of their obeiſance: and that ſuch hath alwayes bin the cuſtome
of the Church: and that not onely for hereſie, but likewiſe for other
cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> for their ſinnes, if it be fitting: If the Princes be negligent:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3499:5"/>
If they be incapable, and vnprofitable: Moreouer, that the Pope hath
power, both ouer ſpirituall and temporall powers: and that hee hath
ſuch power by Gods law. That man muſt belieue that there is giuen
power to the Church and her Soueraigne Paſtor <hi>to puniſh (the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
which offend againſt the diuine and humane lawes, with temporall
paines: and that eſpecially if their crime be hereſie.</hi> They haue likewiſe
ſaid, that the Author of this Booke affirmeth, That the Apoſtles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were in effect <hi>ſubiect to the ſecular Princes, were not by
right their Subiects, as likewiſe that as ſoone as the Maieſtie of the
Soueraigne Biſhop hath beene eſtabliſhed all Princes haue beene ſubiect
vnto him.</hi> To be briefe, they haue reported that this man explicated
theſe words of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>All</hi> that whatſoeuer you ſhall binde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, &amp;c. are not onely to be vnderſtood of the ſpirituall power,
but alſo of the temporall: and that he hath corrupted the Text of
<hi>St. Powell</hi> in cutting off of a deniall, and that he maketh many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
to ſpeake ſuch things which they haue neuer imagined or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued:
And concluding thereupon, that both theſe and other things
deſerued very well the correction and cenſure of this facultie of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie:
The Deane hauing thereupon taken the matter in delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and all the opinions of the Doctors being heard, and their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
gathered, This facultie hath reproued and condemned the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which is contained in theſe propoſitions, and concluſions of
the ſaid chapters, as being new, falſe, erronious, and contrary to the
word of God; alleaging that it maketh odious the dignitie of the
Soueraigne Biſhop, and opened the way to Schiſme; that it tendeth
to the preiudice of the ſoueraigne authoritie of Princes, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
onely from God, and that it hindereth the conuerſion of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
and hereticall Princes; that it troubleth the publike peace,
and hindereth the welfare of Kingdomes, States, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths;
And to be ſhort, that it draweth and diſtracteth the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
from the obeyſance which they owe to their Soueraignes, and
prouoked them to factions, rebellions, and ſeditions, and induceth
them to attempt againſt the liues of their Princes.</p>
