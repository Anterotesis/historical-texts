         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Since it is liberally acknowledged by every body, that knows any thing (not only at home, but abroad also among Foreigners) that <hi>Europe</hi> seldom hath brought forth <hi>His Fellow</hi> for exquisite Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Nature, Attainments of Study, and Accomplishments of Ingenuity, Sagacity and Industry. And indeed, to save me the labour of saying any more concerning this <hi>Non-pareil</hi> in all kinds of Learning, His own <hi>WORKS,</hi> which are now
<pb facs="tcp:108529:6"/>
under a Review, and will e're long be made Publick in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Volumes, will sufficiently speak his Character, and be a more prevailing Argument to indear Him to thy good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and firm Acquaintance, than mine or any other <hi>Words</hi> can.</p>
                  <p>My business now is only to give thee some Account of the Author's design in this little <hi>Treatise,</hi> and of those mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures I took in Translating Him, that is, in restoring him to his own Native Language; though his great <hi>Genius</hi> had made the <hi>Latin</hi> and several other <hi>Tongues,</hi> as natural and familiar to Himself, as the <hi>English</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>To speak first of the <hi>Author,</hi> I do take this Piece to have been one of his first Essays, if not the very first; wherein he launched into the World, and did not so much try the Judgement, as deservedly gain the Approbation of the Learned: which was certainly one Reason, why, though the whole matter of the Book be of an <hi>English</hi> Complexion and Concern, yet he thought fit to put it forth in a <hi>Latin</hi> dress. That this was his first <hi>Specimen,</hi> or at least one of the first, I gather from the time of his Writing it, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Six and Twentieth year of his Age; when I suppose he was not of any very long standing in the <hi>Temple</hi>; I mean, in all likelihood, whilst he was on this side the Bar. For having fraught himself with all kind of Learning, which the <hi>University</hi> could afford him (which could be, we must imagine, no small time neither; as I may be allowed to guess from that passage of his in this Book, where he so affectionately recognizeth his Duty and Gratitude to his dear Mother <hi>OXFORD</hi>; who, if she had no other <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> to boast of, is and ever will be Famous for This Her Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, our great <hi>Antiquary</hi>; who hath also such a Monument to be seen in her publick <hi>Library,</hi> as will make her Glory and his Memory ever to flourish) I say, having after some compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent time taken leave of <hi>Academical</hi> Institutions, and being now engaged into the Study of <hi>Law,</hi> he thought he could not do his Profession a better service, than by looking back into former times, and making a faithful Collection of what might be Pertinent and Useful, to bring down, along through all Changes and Vicissitudes of State, the Light and Strength, the Evidence and Reputation of old Institutes and Precedents to our present Establishments under our Gracious and Happy Monarchy. May It, as it is in its Constitution to the <hi>English</hi> people <hi>Gracious;</hi> so be ever in its Success to It self, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<pb facs="tcp:108529:6"/>
to Us all, <hi>Happy!</hi> Here then thou wilt find the Rights of Government through all Ages, so far as our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will help us; Here thou wilt see, from the first, our <hi>KING</hi> setled in his just Power, even in his <hi>Ecclesiastical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi> against the <hi>Papal Usurpation;</hi> one shrewd Instance whereof is, the forbidding Appeals to the <hi>Pope,</hi> at such a time when the <hi>Popish Religion</hi> was at its Zenith in this Island; that is, when People in all probability were most Ignorant. Here thou wilt easily be brought to acknowledge the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Usefulness of <hi>Parliaments</hi> (though under other Names till after the Conquest) when all the <hi>Barons,</hi> that is, as that Title did at first import, all Lords of Mannors, all Men of Estate assembled together for the determination of publick Affairs: which Usage, because it produced too numerous and cumbersome a confluence, was afterwards for better conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience retrenched into a popular Election by the Kings Writ to chuse some of the Chiefest to act for all the rest. And sure enough, if we in Duty keep up the <hi>Royal Prerogative,</hi> and our Kings, as ever they have done, and ever, I hope, will, in Grace and Clemency oblige the <hi>Peoples Consent</hi> in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives; we shall alwayes have such Laws, such a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, such a Correspondence betwixt Prince and Subjects, as must (according to the Rules of Humane Prudence, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Piety to it) make this Kingdom of Great <hi>Britanny</hi> (maugre the malice of the Devil and his Agents whatever, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi> or <hi>Fanaticks</hi>) a flourishing and impregnable Kingdom.</p>

                  <p>As to the <hi>Translator;</hi> I confess, it is no great credit for any one to appear in that Figure; a Remark, which I have learn't from one, who hath translated another excellent Piece of this <hi>Noble Author, (Noble</hi> I call him, sith Nobility is rais'd by Parts and Merits, no less than continued by Birth and Descent) it was his <hi>Mare Clausum,</hi> wherein he, I spoke of, hath acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self very well, abating for his Villanous <hi>Dedication</hi> to the <hi>RUMP-Parliament,</hi> which was then setting up for a <hi>Republick;</hi> in which Dedication of his, he hath vilely and like himself (I
<pb facs="tcp:108529:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
speak in Charity, as to his Interest, I mean, not his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Conscience at least, if there were any) aspersed the <hi>Royal Family</hi> with Weakness and Collusion, to have lower'd the <hi>British</hi> Renown.</p>
                  <p>I am bid by Him, who puts this into thy hands, to tell thee, that when he was embark'd into this Employ; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, upon the coasting of it over, he was surprized to find, he had undertaken such a difficult and hazardous Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and did presently conclude, That none but a <hi>Selden</hi> (that is, a Person of omnifarious Reading) was fit to be a <hi>Selden</hi>'s Interpreter. For no other person, but one so qualified, can be Master of his Sense, Master of his Expression. His ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Style, where he delivers himself plainest, is as to the Matter of it, so full of Historical and Poetical Allusions and as to the Method (and hath that of Crabbed in it besides) so Intricate and Perplex, that he seems, even where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Teach and Instruct, to have intended only to Amuse and Confound the Reader. In very deed, it is such a Style, as became a Learned <hi>Antiquary,</hi> which is to be <hi>Antique</hi> and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; that one would think, the very Paper, he wrote upon, was made of the <hi>Sibyll</hi>'s old-worn Sheets, and that his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could not be fisht out without the assistance of a <hi>Delian</hi> Diver. However the <hi>Translator</hi> (though so much Inferiour to the Undertaking, as to be almost Unacquainted with some considerable parts of it) did presume (whether rightly or no, must be left to thy judgement) that he was not utterly unfurnished with those Skills and Helps, which might make the Work Intelligible and Acceptable even to Plebeians. For though it was at first designed by the Excellent Author in his <hi>Latin</hi> for such as were meerly Lawyers and Scholars (they must be both, that mean to understand it as he wrote it) yet now it being done into <hi>English,</hi> it was to be calculated to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of common Capacities and vulgar Understandings. Which end he hath, he hopes, in some good measure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; and in order to which end, he hath, to supply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his <hi>Translation,</hi> at the end of the Book subjoyned some <hi>Annotations,</hi> which may serve partly to clear the Author's meaning, and partly to vindicate himself in the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He did think once to have affixt those <hi>Annotations</hi> to the places they belong to; but upon second and better thoughts, he consider'd, that the Authors <hi>Quotations</hi> would be enow of themselves to charge the <hi>Margin</hi> with, and a further superfoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb facs="tcp:108529:7"/>
would but cloy and surbate the Reader; though in the body of the Work, there are up and down many Explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inserted, to excuse him from the trouble of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to those Notes, which are added out of pure necessity, and not from any vanity of Ostentation, since the whole, if it had its due, might seem to require a perpetual <hi>Comment.</hi> In the main, which is enough for a <hi>Translator,</hi> be his <hi>Author</hi> what he will, he doth assure thee, that the meanest Subject of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> may now read one of her greatest Champions and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (for Learned Pens sometimes do as good and as great service as Valiant Swords do) so understandingly, that he may edifie and learn, what duty and deference he ought to have for the Best of Governments.</p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> excuse me in a Digression, and do not impute it as a Levity to me, that I follow my Grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. It is my Duty so to do; it is my Happiness, if I can: He doth not despair, now he appears in <hi>English,</hi> to have <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male-Readers</hi> too, to court him so far at least as to peruse his Translation, who hath so highly courted them with Noble Caresses in that Chapter, wherein he hath so learnedly plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Excellencies and Rights of that <hi>Angelical Sex,</hi> (if Angels have any Sex) to the abashment and overthrow of the <hi>Salick</hi> Law. To what purpose did the <hi>Author</hi> write so much in their Commendation, if they were not to know it? which, if the poor <hi>Translator</hi> hath any Obligations upon the Sex, he hopes they will own this as an Addition: not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that other Chapter of his, where, like a Gentleman and a Lawyer both, he maintains that freedom peculiar to our <hi>English Ladies,</hi> and which with Lawyers leave, I may call <hi>The Courtesie of England,</hi> in receiving of Salutes, against the censure of Rudeness on the one hand, and the suspicion of Wantonness on the other. Though I must confess also, that some of his Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in that defence, are so free, that I thought fit rather to leave them as I found them, than by putting them into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> to expose the Modesty of the Sex.</p>
                  <p>I have no more to say, <hi>Reader,</hi> but to beg thy Excuse, for any thing, wherein I may appear to have come short of the Weighty and Abstruse Senses of our Great and Worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and that I may detain thee no longer from his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, to bid thee <hi>Farewell.</hi>

Some spare hours have been spent by me in reading over <hi>Historians, Chronologers, Antiquaries,</hi> Foreigners and our own Countrey-men, those of Ancient date and the more polite of the Modern sort: those especially who seem'd to make out the quickest course to that Goal and design I spoke of. I have carefully cull'd out whatsoever I met with, that lookt like the Orders and Decisions of <hi>Praetors</hi> or Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, and whatsoever concerns the <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Prophane Law. (Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi> I call that, which is not held by the Religion of the Church; as <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> hath taught me.) I did judge that there were a great many things in those Writers worth the knowing, and which might deserve to be digested into a kind of Volume according to order of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, I did in the first place advise, and took that special order with my self, that as to this undertaking, I might with the greater ease have my Attendants ready at hand to wait upon my Studies. I went about to give s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I have applyed my self not only to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Writers, or to their historical account, but even to the very words and syllables, which they spoke, and have inserted them printed in a different character; those, I confess, unless it be from them of the middle age, many times sufficiently barbarous, that miserably want po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing, such as Criti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherein he in some measure followed well near the practice of <hi>Alaricus,</hi> who having conquered the <hi>Romans,</hi> and finding that they took it in dudgeon to be bound up by the Laws of the <hi>Goths,</hi> though in other things they were compliant enough, restored to them the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, but by sly interpretations against the sense and meaning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws he drew these Laws back again to the <hi>Gothish.</hi> For the times on this side the <hi>Normans</hi> entrance, are so full of new Laws, especially such as belong to the right of Tenancy or Vassalage; though other Laws have been carefully enough kept up from the time of the

without a world of rubs in the way and slips or distances of years, I saw I was not able to put upon the work the face of a History, and to muster up all things that are wanting. Very many things are so effaced by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of time, several things have been lost through neglect, nor is the Learned World under a small discontent, or at small variance by reason of this loss. These remains, which are left us, to be handled upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, I have alwayes accounted pleasant researches: I, and perhaps one may say, that those Learned Pieces, which <hi>Pomponius, Rivallius, Zasius, Oldendorp, Brissonius,</hi> and others, have published concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Twelve Tables, and the Laws written upon Oaken Planks, upon Elephants Skins, and in former Ages upon Brass, are not of more use and advantage for the City <hi>Spire</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> than these Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be for <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> amongst us. We have said enough and to spare, concerning the model and frame of the Work. For me now to beg the Readers pardon, that I may speak a little concerning my self, seeing it was at my own choice, whether I would give him trouble or no, would be silly.

                     </p>
                     <p>Well, as the Commentary of <hi>Annius</hi> has it, <q>This <hi>Samothes</hi> was Brother to <hi>Gomar</hi> and <hi>Tubal</hi> by their Father <hi>Japhet,</hi> from whom first the <hi>Britans,</hi> then the <hi>Gauls</hi> were called <hi>Samothei;</hi> and especially the Philosophers and Divines that were his followers.</q> And out of <hi>Laertius</hi> he tells us, <q>For it is evident, that among the <hi>Persians</hi> the <hi>Magi</hi> flourished, among the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Assyrians</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were famous, among the <hi>Celts</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> the <hi>Druids,</hi> and those who were called <hi>Samothei;</hi> who, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Magick, and <hi>Sotion</hi> in his Three and Twentieth Book of Successions do witness, were men very well skilled in Laws Divine and Humane, and upon that account were much addicted to Religion; and were for that reason termed <hi>Samothei.</hi>
                        </q> These very words you meet with in <hi>Annius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The name of <hi>Laertius</hi> is pretended, and the beginning of his Volume concerning the Lives of Philosophers. Why then let us read <hi>Laertius</hi> himself; <q>and amongst the <hi>Celts</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> (saith he) the <hi>Semnothei</hi> as saith <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Book of Magick, and <hi>Sotion</hi> in his Three and Twentieth of Succession.</q> Concerning the <hi>Samothei</hi> any other wayes there is not so much as one syllable. That they were men well skilled in Laws Divine and Humane, or that they had their name given them upon that account, only the <hi>Latin</hi> and foisted Edition of B. <hi>Brognol</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> has told us: whereas in truth, in all the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of <hi>Laertius,</hi> which that great Scholar <hi>Harry Stephen</hi> saw and consulted with (and he sayes he perused Eight or Nine) there is no mention at all made of that business.</p>
                     <p>And yet for all that, I cannot perswade my self, that it was only for want of care, or by meer chance, that this slipt into the Glosses: It does appear, that there have been able Lawyers and Master Philosophers not only among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and those of <hi>Italy;</hi> but also among the <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, however Barbarous. Witness the <hi>Druids</hi> among us, and among the <hi>Goths,</hi> as <hi>Jornandes</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Jornand. de reb.

                     <p>There are some, who in <hi>Laertius</hi> read <hi>Samothei</hi>; which is a device of those men, who with too much easiness (they are <hi>Isaac Casaubon</hi>'s words) that I may say no worse, suffer themselves to be led by the Nose by that counterfeit <hi>Berosus.</hi>

And by <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi> they are set for Civil Magistrates. Judges in Scripture so called <hi>Elohim, i. e.</hi> Gods. These <hi>Semnai theai</hi> the same as <hi>Deae Matres</hi> in an old British Inscription.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ANd indeed if the <hi>Samothei</hi> had any thing to do with truth, or the <hi>Semnothei</hi> any thing to do with the ancient Law of the <hi>Celts</hi> (in as much as they write, that <hi>Britany</hi> was once in subjection to the <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Kings) I should judge it not much beside the design of my intended Method to inquire into the name and nature of them both. But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both one and t'other past all hope, except such a one as <hi>Lucian</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Inhabitants of the Sun, or those of the Moon, would write their History, to speak of them would be more than to lose ones labour. I dare not to say much of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I imagine, sayes <hi>Harry Stephen,</hi> they were so called,<note place="margin">Steph. ad Laert.</note> for having the Gods often in their mouths, and that in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that is, <hi>The Worshipful Gods</hi>; or for that they themselves were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted amongst men as a kind of Worshipful Gods: but, writes he, this latter I do not take to be so likely as the former.</q> But say I for my part, if I might venture my opinion against the judgement of so great a person, I guess this latter to be the likelier of the two.</p>
                     <p>That the old <hi>Heroes</hi> went by the names of Gods, is a thing we read every where; nor did Antiquity grudge the bestowal of this honour even upon <hi>Philosophers.</hi> Not upon <hi>Amphiaraus</hi> the Prophet; not upon <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> not upon <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> renowned Physicians; they are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the middle sort of Gods.<note place="margin">Aug. de Civ. Dei, l. 2. c. 14. Laert. lib. 5.</note> Thus <hi>Plato</hi> also was accounted by <hi>Antistius Labeo</hi> for a Demy-god, and <hi>Tyrtamus</hi> for his Divine eloquence, had the name of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> (that is, God-like Speaker) given him by his Master <hi>Aristotle.</hi> No wonder then, if thereupon thence forward great Philosophers were called <hi>Semnothei,</hi> and as it were Worshipful Gods. These instances incline me, whilst I only take a view of their Philosophy; whom, if either the authority of <hi>Annius,</hi> or the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Brognol</hi> had sufficiently and fairly made out to have been also at the same time Students and Masters of Law, I should hardly stick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to affirm, that I had found out in what places the true natural spring and source both of their name, and as I may say, of their dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated power is to be met with.</p>
                     <p>For I have it in <hi>Pausanias</hi> (forbear your flouts, because I waft over into <hi>Greece,</hi> from whence the most ancient Customs both Sacred and Prophane of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> came) I say in <hi>Pausanias</hi> the most diligent searcher of the <hi>Greek</hi> Antiquities, I meet upon <hi>Mars</hi> his Hill at <hi>Athens,</hi> and also in his <hi>Achaicks</hi> (or Survey of <hi>Achaia</hi>) with Chappels of the Goddesses whom the <hi>Athenians</hi> styled <gap reason="foreign">

Moreover, that the Land might not lye barren, nor the people be frequently oppressed or lessened through Dearth or want of Corn, if Cattle alone should possess the Fields, which ought to be tilled by men, he appointed how many Ploughs every County should have, and set a penalty upon them by whose means that number should be diminished: And he made a Law, That Labouring Beasts which attended the Plough, should not be distrained by Officers, nor assigned over to Creditors for money that was owing, if the Debtor had any other Goods left.</q> Thus much <hi>Polydore.</hi>

                     <p>What? <hi>Greek letters?</hi> so we read <hi>Greek</hi> ones. Why! <hi>Marseilles,</hi> a City of <hi>France,</hi> which was a Greek Colony of the <hi>Phocians,</hi> had made the <hi>Gauls</hi> such lovers of <hi>Greeks,</hi> that, as <hi>Strabo</hi> the Geographer tells us,<note place="margin">Strab.

                     </p>
                     <p>But, for all that, I would not have any one from hence rashly to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the <hi>Greek Language</hi> was in use to that Age and People, or to these Philosophers and Lawyers.

they had the <hi>Greek Tongue</hi> too; this truly were a pitiful consequence. At this rate the <hi>Targum</hi> or <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase,</hi> as <hi>Paulus Merula</hi> has it, and <hi>Goropius</hi> before him, would consist of the <hi>Hebrew Language,</hi> because 'tis Printed in <hi>Hebrew Characters:</hi> And the like may be said of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi> in <hi>Syriack,</hi> done in <hi>Hebrew letters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What? that those very Letters of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>Caesars</hi> time, and as we now write them, are rather <hi>Gallick</hi> (as borrowed from the <hi>Gauls</hi>) than <hi>Greek?</hi> He was acquainted with those <hi>Greek</hi> letters, but did not yet know the <hi>Gallick</hi> ones, which learned men do think the <hi>Greeks</hi> took for their Copy, after the <hi>Phoenician</hi> letters, which were not altogether unlike the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> were grown out of use. Consult for this <hi>Wolfgangus Lazius</hi> his <hi>Celtae, Becanus</hi> his <hi>Gallica,</hi> and if thou hast a mind, <hi>Annius</hi> his <hi>Archilochus, Xenophons Aequivoca,</hi> and what others write concerning <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Cadmus, Palamedes,</hi> and <hi>Simonides,</hi> the first Inventors of the Alphabet.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time take this from me, that those ancient and rude <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick</hi> Characters, which <hi>Bonaventure Vulcanius</hi> of <hi>Bruges,</hi> lately put forth,<note place="margin">Vulcan. in app. ad Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.

In the mean time, <hi>Rome</hi> by a like misfortune, was threatned with imminent danger, by the fury of the <hi>Goths:</hi> all <hi>Italy</hi> was in a fright, in an uproar. For the maintaining of whose liberty, the Empire being then more than sinking, was with all its united strength engaged and ready prepared. So this way the <hi>Britans</hi> met with a disappointment. Wherefore <hi>Vortigern,</hi> who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in Chief, sent for supplies from the neighbouring <hi>Germans,</hi> and invited them in.

At length being taken with the sweetness of the soil (a great number of their Countrey-men flocking over after them, as there were at that time fatal flittings and shiftings of quarters all the World over) and spurred on with the desire of the chief command and rule, having struck up a League with the <hi>Picts,</hi> they raise a sad and lamentable War against their new entertainers, in whose service they had lately receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pay: and to make short, in the end having turned the <hi>Britans</hi> out of their Ancestors Seats they advanced themselves into an <hi>Heptarchy</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> so called from them.</p>
                     <p>Albeit they pass by various names, yet in very deed they were all of them none other but <hi>Saxons.</hi> A name at that time of a large extent in <hi>Germany;</hi> which was not, as later Geographers make it, bounded with the Rivers of the <hi>Elb,</hi> of the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Oder,</hi> and with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Hessen</hi> and <hi>Duringen,</hi> and with the <hi>Ocean;</hi> but reached as far as into the <hi>Cimbrian Chersonesus</hi> now called <hi>Jutland.</hi> It is most likely, that those of them that dwelt by the Sea-side, came over by Ship into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny.</hi> To wit, at first <hi>Horsus</hi> and <hi>Hengistus</hi> came over out of <hi>Batavia,</hi> or the Low Countreys, with a great company of <hi>Saxons</hi> along with them; after that out of <hi>Jutland</hi> the <hi>Jutes</hi> (for <hi>Janus Douza</hi> proves,<note place="margin">Ja.

                        <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> way of judging the Event of War with an Enemy. Their manner of approving a proposal in Council, by clattering their Arms. The Original of <hi>Hundred-Courts.</hi> Their dubbing their Youth into Men. The priviledge of young Lads Nobly born. The <hi>Morganheb</hi> or Wedding-dowry.</p>

THey take a Prisoner of that Nation, with which they are to have a War, by what way soever they can catch him, and chose out one of their own Countrey-men; and putting on each of them the Arms of their own Countrey, make them two fight toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and judge of the Victory, according as the one or the other of them shall overcome. This very thing also <hi>Tacitus</hi> himself hath to whom <hi>Einhard</hi> sends his Reader. For though he treat in general of the <hi>Germans,</hi> yet nevertheless without any question, our <hi>Saxons</hi> brought over along with them into this Island very many of those things, which are delivered to us by those who have wrote concerning the Customs of the <hi>Germans.</hi> Among which, take these following.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. In Councils or publick Assemblies, the King or Prince, (<hi>i.e.</hi> a chief person) according as every ones Age is, according to his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, according to his Reputation in Arms, according to his Eloquence, has audience given him, where they use the authority of perswading, rather than the power of commanding. If they dislike what he sayes, they disapprove it with a Hum and a rude noise. If they like the proposal, they shake and rustle their Spears or Partisans together. It is the most honourable kind of assent, to commend the Speaker with the clattering of their Arms. From hence perhaps arose the ancient right of <hi>Wapentakes.</hi>

                        <p n="26">26. There are also chosen at the same Councils or Meetings, chief persons (as Justices) to administer Law in the several Villages and Hamlets. Each of those have a hundred Associates out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty for their Counsel and Authority. This is plainly the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict of our <hi>Hundreds,</hi> which we still have throughout the Counties of <hi>England.</hi>

They do nothing of publick or private affair, but with their Arms on; but it is not the custom for any one to wear Arms, before the City or Community approve of him as sufficient for it. Then in the Council it self, either some one of the Princes or chief persons, or the Father of the young man or some Kinsman of his in token of respect, give him a Shield and a Partisan. This with them stands for the Ceremony of the Gown; this the first honour of youth arriving at manhood; before this be done, they seem but a part of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but after this is over, they are a part of the Common-wealth.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Royal Consorts great Priviledge of Granting. Felons Estates forfeited to the King. Estates granted by the King with three Exceptions of Expedition, Bridge, and Castle. The Ceremony of the Kings presenting a Turf at the Altar of that Church, to which he gave Land. Such a Grant of King <hi>Ethelbald</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in old Verse.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Donations or Grants of the <hi>Royal Consort,</hi> though not by the Kings Authority, contrary to what the Priviledge of any other Wife is, were ratified also in that Age, as they were by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law: Which by the Patent of <hi>Aethelswith,</hi>

Relat.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having already mentioned those Hand-writings or Grants, which are from one hand and t'other, conveyances of Tenure (the fewel of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels) I have a mind, over and above what has been said, to set down also these Remarks, as being to our purpose; and taken from the <hi>Saxons.</hi> As for instance, that those are most frequent whereby Estates are convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be held with the best and fairest right; yet most commonly these three things excepted, to wit, <hi>Expedition,</hi> Repairing of <hi>Bridges,</hi> and Building of <hi>Castles:</hi> And that those to whom the Grants were made, were very seldom acquitted upon this account. These three exceptions are noted by the term of a <hi>three-knotted necessity</hi> in an old Charter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in King <hi>Cedwalla</hi> granted to <hi>Wilfrid</hi> (the first Bishop of <hi>Shelsey</hi> in <hi>Sussex)</hi> the Village of <hi>Paganham</hi> in the said County.<note place="margin">Anno Dom. 680.</note> 
                        <q>For though in the Grants of King <hi>Ethelulph</hi> the Church be free (says <hi>Ingulph</hi>) and there be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of all things for the release of our Souls,<note place="margin">Ingulph.</note> and pardon of our sins to serve God alone without Expedition, and building of Bridge, and fortifying of Castle; to the intent that the Clergy might wholly attend Divine Service:</q> Yet in that publick debate of Parliament, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, concerning the ancient State, Freedom, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>English Church;</hi> and concerning the hourly exactions of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Leeches,</hi> Jugglers and Decoys of <hi>Rome,</hi> that strolled up and down the Country to pick Peoples Pockets, to the great prejudice of the Common-wealth; they did indeed stand for the priviledge of the Church, and produced as Witnesses thereof the Instruments and Grants of Kings; who nevertheless were not so much inclined to countenance that liberty of the Church, but that, as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> observes,<note place="margin">Matth.

                     </p>
                     <p>I take no notice how King <hi>Ethelred</hi> the twelfth perhaps (but by no means the fifteenth,<note place="margin">Ralph Holins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed in Hen. 7.</note> wherein an Historian of ours has blundred) hath signed the third year of his Reign by the term of an <hi>Olympiad,</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Greek</hi> computation or reckoning: As likewise I pass other things of the like kind, which are many times used and practised according to the fancy of the Clerks or Notaries. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the last words, which are the close of these Grants and Patents, are not to be slighted.

                     <p>
                        <q>Some of these <hi>English</hi> Laws he disliked and laid aside; others he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, and added to them, some from beyond Sea out of <hi>Neustria</hi> (he means <hi>Normandy,</hi> which they did of old, term <hi>Neustria</hi> corruptly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>Westrich,</hi> as being the more Western Kingdom of the <hi>Franks,</hi> and given by <hi>Charles the Simple</hi> to <hi>Rollo</hi> for his Daughter <hi>Gilla</hi> her porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) such of them as seemed most effectual for the preserving of the Kingdoms peace.</q> This saith he of <hi>Tilbury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this is no rare thing among Writers for them to devise, that <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Conqueror brought in as it were a clear new face of Laws to all intents and purposes. 'Tis true, this must be acknowledg'd, that he did make some new ones (part whereof you may see in <hi>Lambard</hi>'s <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeonomia,</hi> and part of them here subjoyned) but so however that they take their denomination from the <hi>English,</hi> rather than from the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>; although one may truly say, according to what Lawyers dispute, that the <hi>English</hi> Empire and Government was overthrown by him. That he did more especially affect the Laws of the <hi>Danes</hi> (which were not much unlike to those of the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> to whom <hi>William</hi> was by his Grand-father allied in blood) I read in the Annals of <hi>Roger Hoveden.</hi> And that he openly declared, that he would rule by them; <q>at hearing of which, all the great men of the Countrey, who had enacted the <hi>English</hi> Laws, were presently struck into dumps, and did unanimously
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108529:43"/>
petition him, That he would permit them to have their own Laws and ancient Customs; in which their Fathers had lived, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had been born and bred up in; forasmuch as it would be very hard for them to take up Laws that they knew not, and to give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to them. But the King appearing unwilling and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie to be moved, they at length prosecuted their purpose, beseeching him, that for the Soul of King <hi>Edward,</hi> who had after his death given up the Crown and Kingdom to him, and whose the Laws were, and not any others that were strangers, he would hearken to them and grant that they might continue under their own Countrey Laws. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon calling a Council, he did at the last yield to the request of the Barons. From that day forward therefore the Laws of King <hi>Edward,</hi> which had before been made and appointed by his Grand-father <hi>Adgar,</hi> seeing their authority, were before the rest of the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey respected, confirmed and observed all over <hi>England.</hi>
                        </q> But what then? Doth it follow that all things in <hi>William</hi>'s time were new? How can a man chuse but believe it? The Abbot of <hi>Crowland</hi> sayes this of it, <q>I have brought with me from <hi>London</hi> into my Monastery the Laws of the most Righteous King <hi>Edward,</hi> which my Renowned Lord King <hi>William</hi> hath by Proclamation ordered, under most grievous penalties, to be authentick and perpetual, to be kept inviolably throughout the whole Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and hath recommended them to his Justices, in the same language wherein they were at first set forth and published.</q> And in the Life of <hi>Fretherick</hi> Abbot of S. <hi>Albans</hi> you have this account: <q>After many debates, Arch-Bishop <hi>Lanfrank</hi> being then present (at <hi>Berkhamstead</hi> in <hi>Hartfordshire</hi>) the King did for the good of peace, take his Oath upon all the Reliques of the Church of S. <hi>Alban,</hi> and by touching the holy Gospels,<note place="margin">Camden.</note> 
                           <hi>Fretherick</hi> the Abbot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring the Oath, that he would inviolably observe the good and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ancient Laws of the Kingdom, which the holy and pious Kings of <hi>England</hi> his Predecessors, and especially King <hi>Edward</hi> had appointed.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But you will much more wonder at that passage of <hi>William le Rouille</hi> of <hi>Alençon</hi> in his Preface to the <hi>Norman</hi> Customs.<note place="margin">Guil. le Rouille Alencon.</note> 
                        <q>That vulgar Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, saith he, which is intitled the <hi>Chronicle of Chronicles,</hi> bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that S. <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> was the Maker or Founder of this Custom; where he speaks of <hi>William</hi> the Bastard Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, alias</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> saying, that whereas the foresaid S. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> had no Heirs of his own Body, he made <hi>William</hi> Heir of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who after the Defeat and Death of <hi>Harald</hi> the Usurper of the Kingdom, did freely obtain and enjoy the Kingdom upon this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit, that he would keep the Laws which had before been made by the fore-mentioned <hi>Edward;</hi> which <hi>Edward</hi> truly had also given Laws to the <hi>Normans,</hi> as having been a long time also brought up himself in <hi>Normandy.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where then, I pray you, is the making of new Laws? Why! with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, according to <hi>Tilbury,</hi> we are to think, that together with the ratifying of old Laws, there was mingled the making of some new ones: and in this case one may say truly with the Poet in his Panegyrick:

Nor was it possible that the <hi>Normans</hi> should not have that in use, which had been so anciently practised by the <hi>French.</hi> Let me add this out of the ancient Register of <hi>Abendon:</hi> 
                        <q>That <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Chester</hi> (who flourished in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the first) ordered to sign a certain Writing with the Seal of his Mother <hi>Ermentrude</hi>;<note place="margin">Camden in Ord.

                     <p>Indeed it was such a fault to be ignorant in the <hi>French,</hi> or not to be able to speak it; that mainly upon this account,<note place="margin">Matth.

                        </q> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless however this business went, we are told that in the memory of our Fathers, and that by an ancient order, there were Lectures of the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> language, read at <hi>Tavistock</hi> Abby in <hi>Devonshire.</hi>

them out of their Lands, not in sums of Gold or Silver, but only in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals or Provisions: Out of which the Kings house was supplied with necessaries for daily use; and they who were deputed to this service (the <hi>Purveyors</hi>) knew what quantity arose from each several land. But yet as to Soldiers pay or donatives, and for other necessaries concerning the Pleas of the Kingdom, or Conventions, as also from Cities and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles where they did not exercise Husbandry or Tillage; in such instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, payments were made in ready mony. Wherefore this Institution lasted all the time of <hi>William</hi> the First, to the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> his Son, so that I my self (<hi>Gervase</hi> flourished in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond) have seen some people, who did at set times carry from the Kings Lands, victuals or provisions of food to Court. And the Officers also of the Kings house knew very well, having it upon account, which Counties were to send in Wheat, which to send in several sorts of flesh, and Provender for the Horses. These things being paid according to the appointed manner and proportion of every thing, the Kings Officers reckoned to the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> by reducing it into a sum of pence; to wit, for a measure of Wheat to make bread for a hundred men, one shilling; for the body of a pasture-fed Beef, one shilling; for a Ram or a Sheep four pence; for the allowance of twenty horses likewise four pence: But in process of time, when as the said King was busie in remote parts beyond Sea to appease Tumults and Insurrections; it so happened, that ready mony was highly necessary for him to supply his occasions. In the mean time, there came in multitudes, a great company of Husbandmen with complaints to the Kings Court, or which troubled him more, they frequently came in his way as he was passing by, holding up their Ploughshares, in token that their Husbandry was running to decay; for they were put to a world of trouble, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the provisions which they carried from their own quarters through several parts of the Kingdom. Thereupon the King being moved with their complaints, did by the resolved advice of his Lords, appoint throughout the Kingdom such persons, as he knew were, for their prudence and discretion, fit for the service. These persons going about, and that they might believe their own eyes, taking a view of the several Lands, having made an estimate of the provisions which were paid out of them, they reduced it into a sum of pence. But for the total sum, which arose out of all the Lands in one County, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the <hi>Sheriff</hi> of that County should be bound to the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer: Adding this withal, that he should pay it at the <hi>Scale.</hi>

                     <p>AS of old, unless the Shields were laid up, there was no Dancing at Weddings; so except Arms be put aside, there is no pleading of Laws.

The Constitution of <hi>Clarendon</hi> style those <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks</hi> or Countrymen, whom he calls <hi>Yumen;</hi> and <hi>Rusticks</hi> and <hi>Villains</hi> (those among the <hi>English</hi> were slaves or servants) were anciently synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous words, meaning the same thing. For whereas <hi>Henry Londres,</hi> Arch Bishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> had treacherously committed to the flames, the Charters of his Rustick Tenants, the Free Tenants called him, as we read in the Annals of <hi>Ireland, Scorch-Uillein;</hi> as if one would say,<note place="margin">Annal.

                     <p>Nor should I think it unseasonable in this place, to take notice of a mistake or oversight of <hi>Thomas Spott,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> who writes, that the <hi>English,</hi> before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, knew nothing of private servitude or bondage; <hi>i. e.</hi> had no such thing as Villanage among them: For he is convinced both by the Maid of <hi>Andover,</hi> King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Miss,<note place="margin">Malmsb. l. 1. de gest.

                     <p>TO the Laws of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> which I spoke of, the States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (the <hi>Baronage</hi>) and with them the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> took their Oaths in solemn manner, calling upon God. There were Embassadors sent to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, that there might be that bottom also, that he would further confirm and ratifie them. But he was so far from doing that, that he did not only pretend that they did too much derogate from the priviledge of the Clergy, and wholly refuse to give his assent to them; but also having absolved <hi>Thomas</hi> the Arch-Bishop, at his own request, from the obligation of that Oath he had bound himself with, he condemned them as impious, and such as made against the interest and honour of holy Church. King <hi>Henry,</hi> as soon as he heard of it, took it, as it was fit he should, very much in dudgeon; grievously and most deservedly storming at the insolence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, and the Treachery of the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Immediately Letters were dispatcht to the several Sheriffs of the respective Counties, <q>That if any Clerk or Layman in their Bayliwicks, should appeal to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they should seise him and take him into firm custody; till the King give order what his pleasure is: And that they should seise into the Kings hand, and for his use, all the Revenues and Possessions of the Arch-Bishops Clerks; and of all the Clerks that are with the Arch-Bishop; they should put by way of safe pledge the Fathers, Mothers, and Sisters, Nephews and Neeces, and their Chattels, till the King give order what his pleasure is.</q> I have told the Story out of <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Here let me say a little concerning the Tryal by Fire and Water, or the <hi>Ordeals.</hi> It is granted, that these were the <hi>Saxons</hi> wayes of tryal, rashly and unadvisedly grounded upon Divine Miracle. They do more appertain to Sacred Rites, than to Civil Customs; for which reason we past them by in the former Book, and this place seemed not unseasonable to put the Reader in mind of them. <q>He who is accused, is bound to clear himself ('tis <hi>Ralph Glanvill</hi> writes this) by the Judgement of God,<note place="margin">Glanv. l. 14. c. 1.</note> to wit, by hot burning Iron, or by Water, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent condition of men: by burning hot Iron, if it be a free-man; by Water,<note place="margin">

                           </note> if he be a Countrey-man or Villain.</q> The party accused did carry in his hand a piece of Iron glowing hot, going for the most part two or three steps or paces along, or else with the soles of his feet did walk upon red hot Plough-shares or Coulters, and those, according to the Laws of the <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> nine in number. The Lady <hi>Emme</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Mother being impeached of Adultery with <hi>Aldwin</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winton,</hi> was wonderfully cleared by treading upon so many, and is famous for it in our Histories, being preserved safe from burning, and proved innocent from the Crime.</p>
                     <p>There were two sorts of watery <hi>Ordeal</hi> or tryal by Water; to wit, cold or scalding hot. The party was thrown into the cold water, as in some places at this day Witches are used: he who did not by little and little sink to the bottom, was condemned as guilty of the Crime, as one whom that Element, which is the outward sign in the Sacrament of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did not admit into its bosome. As to scalding Water, ones arm

in that manner thrust in up to the elbow, made a discovery of the truth; and <hi>Aelstan</hi> a Monk of <hi>Abendon,</hi> afterward Bishop of <hi>Shirburn,</hi> thrusting in his bare Hand into a boiling Cauldron, shewed himself with some pride to his Abbot.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p> Of Law-makers. Our Kings not Monarchs at first. Several of them in the same County. The <hi>Druids</hi> meeting-place where. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Saxons,</hi> Laws made in a general Assembly of the States. Several instances. This Assembly under the <hi>Normans</hi> called <hi>Parliament.</hi> The thing taken from a custome of the ancient <hi>Germans.</hi> Who had right to sit in Parliament. The harmony of the Three Estates.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt however <hi>Laws</hi> are not without their <hi>Makers</hi> and their <hi>Guardians,</hi> or they are to no purpose. It remaineth therefore that we say somewhat in general of them. They are <hi>made</hi> either by Use and <hi>Custom</hi> (for things that are approved by long Use, do obtain the force of Law) or by the Sanction and <hi>Authority</hi> of Law-givers. Of ancient time the <hi>Semnothei,</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Druids</hi> were <hi>Law-givers;</hi> amongst the <hi>Britans</hi> I mean.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the <hi>Semnothei</hi> whatsoever doth occurr you had before.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kings</hi> were neither Monarchs of the whole Island, nor so much as of that part of <hi>Brittany</hi> that belonged to the <hi>Angles.</hi> For there were at the same time over the single County of <hi>Kent</hi> four Kings; to wit, <hi>Cyngetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus,</hi> and <hi>Segonax;</hi> and at the same rate in other Counties. Wherefore we have no reason to make any question, but that part wherein we live, now called <hi>England,</hi> was governed by several persons, and was subject to an Aristocracy: according to what <hi>Polydore Virgil, John Twine,</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Druids</hi> were wont to meet, to explain the Laws in being, and to make new ones as occasion required, as is most likely, in some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place designed for that purpose; as now at this very time all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Law go to be decided at <hi>Spire</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their publick Convention or Meeting-place was constantly, as <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Caes. l. 6. de bell. Gall.</note> in the borders of the <hi>Carnutes</hi> the middle Region of all <hi>France.</hi> Some think that a Town at eight Miles distance from the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of those people commonly called <hi>Dreux,</hi> was designed for that use.<note place="margin">Paul.

                     <p>Whilst the <hi>Saxons</hi> governed, the Laws were made in the General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the States or Parliament. In the front of King <hi>Ina</hi>'s Laws ('tis above Eight Hundred and Eighty years that he first reigned) we read thus, <hi>It Ine mid godes gift West-Saxna Cyning mid getbeat &amp; mid lere Cenredes mines fader &amp; hedde &amp; Erconwald mine biscops &amp; mid eallum minum, ealdor mannum, &amp; tham yldestan Witan mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes theode be beodeth, &amp;c.</hi> which in our present <hi>English</hi> speaks thus, <hi>I</hi> Ina <hi>by the Grace of God King of the</hi> West-Saxons, <hi>by the advice and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of</hi> Kenred <hi>my Father, and of</hi> Hedda <hi>and</hi> Erconwald <hi>my Bishops, and of all my Aldermen, and of the Elders and Wise Men of my people, do command,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <note place="margin">Ingulph.</note> who were Kings of the <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

At length we borrowed of the <hi>French</hi> the name of <hi>Parliaments,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Polyd. hist. Angl. l. 11.</note> which before the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the First, <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> sayes, were very rarely held. An usage, that not without good reason seems to have come from the ancient <hi>Germans.</hi> So <hi>Tacitus</hi> sayes of them, <q>Concerning smaller matters the Princes only, concerning things of greater concern, they do all the whole body of them consult; yet in that manner, that those things also, which it was in the peoples power to determine,<note place="margin">Mod. ten.

And I have one that hath left it in writing, that when there was neither Bishop, nor Earl, nor Baron, yet then Kings held their Parliaments: and in King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Patent to the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> (for ye have my leave, if you can find in your heart,<note place="margin">Jo.

                     </p>
                     <p>There were present at <hi>Parliaments,</hi> about the beginning of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> times,<note place="margin">V. 22 Ed. 3. fol. 18.</note> as many as were invested with Thirteen Fees of Knights ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and a third part of one Fee, called <hi>Baron</hi>'s, from their large Estates: for which reason perhaps <hi>John Cochleius</hi> of <hi>Mentz,</hi> in his Epistle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to our most Renowned Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> prefixt before the Chronicle of <hi>Aurelius Cassiodorus,</hi> calls him <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the number of them growing over big, ordered by Proclamation, that those only should come there, whom he should think fit to summon by Writ.</p>
                     <p>These Assemblies do now sit in great State, which with a wonderful harmony of the Three Estates, the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> and the <hi>Commons,</hi> or Deputies of the People, are joyned together, to a most firm se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the publick, and are by a very Learned Man in allusion to that made word in <hi>Livy, Panaetolium</hi> from the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> most rightly called <hi>Pananglium,</hi>

                        <q>As in Musical Instruments and Pipes and in Singing it self, and in Voices (sayes <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Tully</hi>'s Books of the Common-wealth) there is a kind of harmony to be kept out of distinct sounds, which Learned and Skilful Ears cannot endure to hear changed and jarring; and that consort or harmony, from the tuning and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Voices most unlike; yet is rendred agreeing and suitable: so of the highest and middlemost and lowermost States shuffled together, like different sounds, by fair proportion doth a City agree by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of persons most unlike; and that which by Musicians in singing is called <hi>Harmony</hi>: that in a City is <hi>Concord,</hi> the straightest and surest bond of safety in every Common-wealth, and such as can by no means be without Justice.</q>

                        <p> Of the <hi>Norman</hi> Earls. Their Fee. Their power of making Laws. Of the <hi>Barons, i.e.</hi> Lords of Manours. Of the <hi>Court-Baron.</hi> Its rise. An instance of it out of <hi>Hoveden.</hi> Other Offices much alike with the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Shall be briefer concerning the <hi>Normans,</hi> I mean their <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their <hi>Counts</hi> or <hi>Earls</hi> before the Conquest, except those of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and perchance some others, were but Officers, and not as yet heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. When <hi>William</hi> bore the sway, they began to have a certain Fee and a descent of Patrimony; having together with their Title assigned to them a third part of the Revenues or Rents, which did arise out of the whole County to the Exchequer. This custom is clear enough in <hi>Gervase</hi> of <hi>Tilbury</hi> in the case of <hi>Richard de Redueriis</hi> made Earl of <hi>Devonshire</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the First, &amp; <hi>Jeoffrey de Magna Villa</hi> made Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> by <hi>Mawd</hi> the Empress. It seems that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Earls had the self-same right of sharing with the King. So in <hi>Doomsday</hi> Book we find it; <q>The Queen <hi>Edeua</hi> had two parts from <hi>Ipswich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and the Earl or Count <hi>Guert</hi> the third: and so of <hi>Norwich,</hi> that it paid Twenty Pound to the King, and to the Earl Ten Pound: so of the Revenues of the Borough of <hi>Lewes</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> the King had two shares, and the Earl the third. And <hi>Oxford</hi> paid for Toll and Gable, and other customary Duties Twenty Pound a year to the King, besides Six Quarts of Honey, and to Earl <hi>Algar</hi> Ten Pound.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, it appears also that these <hi>Norman</hi> Earls or Counts had some power of making Laws to the people of their Counties. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,<note place="margin">Malmesb. de gest. reg. l. 3.</note> the Monk of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, <q>that the Laws of <hi>William Fitz-Osborn</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford</hi> remained still in force in the said County, that no Souldier for whatsoever offence should pay above Seven Shillings.</q> The Writings and Patents of the men of <hi>Cornwall</hi> concerning their Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries or Tinn-Mines do prove as much; nor need I tell the story, how <hi>Godiva</hi> Lady to the Earl <hi>Leofrick</hi> rid on Horse-back through the Streets of <hi>Coventry</hi> with her hair disshevelled, all hanging about her at full length, that by this means she might discharge them of those Taxes and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the Earl had imposed upon them.</p>
                     <p>Out of the Countreys (wherein all Estates were subject to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Service) the <hi>Barons</hi> had their Territories, as we call them <hi>Mannors;</hi> and in them their Courts to call their Tenants together, at the end of every three Weeks, and to hear and determine their Causes. A Civilian,<note place="margin">Ad leg. 2. de origin. jur.</note> one <hi>Vdalricus Zazius,</hi> would have the original of these Courts among other Nations, to have come by way of imitation from <hi>Romulus</hi> his making of Lords or Patrons, and their Clanns or Tenants. The use of them at this day is common and ordinarily known. But to shew how it was of old, we will borrow out of <hi>Hoveden</hi> this spark of light.<note place="margin">Roger de Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veden in H. 2.</note> 
                        <q>
                           <hi>John Marshall</hi> complained to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, that whereas he had claimed or challenged in the Arch-Bishops Court a piece of Land
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108529:68"/>
to be held from him by right of inheritance, and had a long time pleaded upon it, he could obtain no Justice in the case, and that he had by Oath falsified the Arch-Bishops Court, (that is, proved it to be false by Oath, according to the custom of the Realm: to whom the Arch-Bishop made answer, There has been no Justice wanting to <hi>John</hi> in my Court; but he, I know not by whose advice, or whether of his own head, brought in my Court a certain <hi>Toper,</hi> and swore upon it, that he went away from my Court for default of Justice; and it seemed to the Justices of my Court, that he did me the injury, by withdrawing in that manner from my Court; seeing it is ordained in your Realm, that he who would falsifie anothers Court must swear upon the holy Gospels. The King not regarding these words, swore, that he would have Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Judgement of him; and the Barons of the Kings Court did judge him to be in the Kings Mercy; and moreover they fined him Five Hundred Pound.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to doing Justice in all other Cases, and managing of Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, the <hi>Normans</hi> had almost the same Names and Titles of Officers and Offices as the <hi>Saxons</hi> had.</p>

So then, if this were so, <hi>Caesar,</hi> who without all question was well enough acquainted with the <hi>Greek Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> then in use, yet in all likelihood did not so well know what the true old <hi>Gallick Letters</hi> were, the people being strangers to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and he having but lately had any converse with them, and so might very probably mistake, in thinking that, because the Letters were the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108529:73"/>
same, the <hi>Gauls</hi> might borrow the <hi>Greek</hi> Letters to make use of; whereas the contrary (to wit, that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> after the disuse of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Letters, which <hi>Cadmus</hi> had brought over into <hi>Greece,</hi> took the <hi>Gallick</hi> in their stead) is averr'd by <hi>Lazius, Becanus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Pag. 15. lin. 12. <hi>From the sixth Moon.</hi>] Whether that were from the <hi>sixth Month</hi> they began their reckoning, which among the <hi>Romans,</hi> was <hi>August,</hi> therefore called formerly <hi>Sextilis,</hi> as the rest that follow according to order, are styled <hi>September, October, &amp;c.</hi> or whether it were from the <hi>sixth day</hi> of the Moon's age, (as they apply by way of Proverb <hi>Quartâ Lunâ nati</hi> to the unfortunate, <hi>Hercules</hi> having been born on such a day of the Moon) is none of my business to determine, but to leave it to the Readers own inquiry and judgement.</p>
                        <p>Lin. 17. <hi>Nestor</hi>'s <hi>triple age.</hi>] Which if it be reckoned according to this account of Thirty Years to an Age, makes but Ninety years in all. And though that also be a great Age for a man to handle Arms, and to attend the duty and service of War, yet that is not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a case, but that others may be found in Story to stand in competition with him. Besides it falls short of that description, which <hi>Homer</hi> hath given of him, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Which implyes, that he had out-lived <hi>two</hi> Generations (to wit, the <hi>Fathers</hi> which had been bred up with him, and the <hi>Sons</hi> which had grown up into his acquaintance) and that now he reigned among the <hi>Grand-children,</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> generation, the two former having been swept off the Stage. And in this sense the <hi>Latins</hi> took it, as appears by <hi>Horace,</hi> who sayes of him <hi>ter Aevo functus,</hi> that he had gone through the course of nature, lived out the life of man, three times over; and in that he is styled by another old Poet <hi>triseclisenex,</hi> that is, the Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old Gentleman; for as <hi>aevum</hi> in the one signifies the whole space of humane life, so <hi>seculum</hi> in the other is constantly taken for a Hundred years.</p>
                        <p>Pag. 16. lin. 2. <hi>Greece, all over Italy.</hi>] For all the lower part of <hi>Italy</hi> was at that time inhabited by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and from them called <hi>Magna Graecia,</hi> or <hi>Graecia Major,</hi> in opposition, I suppose, only to <hi>Sicily</hi> the neighbouring Isle, as being alike inhabited by <hi>Greeks,</hi> but of less extent.</p>

                        <p>Lin. 21. <hi>Having their heads uncovered.</hi>] That as they were bare-footed, so they were bare-headed also, perfect <hi>Gymnosophists.</hi> The <hi>Latin</hi> is <hi>nudis pedibus, capita intectae, Graecanico pallio &amp; cucullato, penulâque,</hi> and may be rendred indeed, <hi>having their heads covered</hi> or muffled. But how? <hi>With a Pall hooded and a Satchell.</hi> I, but what had the <hi>Satchell</hi> to do with their heads, that hung at their side, and so they are pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But to pass this, Reader, thou art at thy own choice, to take which interpretation of the two thou wilt; for the <hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>intectae,</hi> as I said, admits of either.</p>

                        <p>Pag. 19. lin. 25. <hi>Amalasincta, Artemisia, Nicaula,</hi> &amp;c.] These brave Ladies or She-Heroes are famous upon record, and need not any thing further for their commendation, but their Name. This <hi>Artemisia</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here, was not the Wife of <hi>Mausolus,</hi> a vertuous and magnificent Woman too, but another who lived in <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s time, a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandress, in alliance with him. <hi>Nicaula,</hi> it seems, though whence he learn't her Name, I cannot tell, for Scripture gives it us not; was she, who is there called the <hi>Queen of the South,</hi> a great admirer of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wisdom.</p>

                        <p>Pag. 28. lin. 11. <hi>Now you for your part are Gods Vicegerent in the Kingdom.</hi>] They are the words of Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Lucy,</hi> the first Christian King, which was in the year of our Lord 183. From whence we may fairly conclude, that in those early dayes, the <hi>Pope of Rome</hi> according to his own acknowledgement had no such pretensions as now for several Ages since they have made, upon the Rights of Princes, to the great disturbance of the World, and reproach of Christian Religion. And indeed this is the more considerable, in that such was the simplicity of devotion in those early Converts, and such the deference, which Princes who embraced the Christian Faith, especially from the Missionaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> had for that <hi>Holy See,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this one single instance; that it had been no hard matter, nor could be judged an unreasonable thing, for them to lay claim to a right, and assert a power, which was so voluntarily offered. Further I add, that seeing the <hi>Donation of Constantine,</hi> besides that it was alwayes look't upon as a piece of forgery, was at best, supposing it true, but an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Grant and Concession, which would not be of authority enough to bear up the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> in all other Kingdoms of the earth; and seeing Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> who was the first that with bare face own'd it, his complyance with <hi>Phocas</hi> was so grosly wicked, that none of their own Writers but are ashamed to make that transaction betwixt those
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108529:74"/>
two, an argument for the Papal pretence: Seeing, I say, it is so, if the Pope be intitled, as their <hi>Canonists</hi> pretend, to an Universal Dominion by vertue of his Office, and by Commission from <hi>Christ</hi> and his chief Apostle S. <hi>Peter,</hi> how came it to pass, that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> all along till <hi>Boniface,</hi> were so modest, as not to challenge any such rights or powers; nay, upon occasion to declare against such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, as <hi>Antichristian</hi>; which, if that be true, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is by his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and by a Divine Commission instated into a <hi>Supremacy,</hi> was in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect no less, than to betray the cause of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi>: how came it to pass, that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> should neglect such a seasonable and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary opportunity of maintaining and exercising his right, and should rather chuse to return it in a complement back to the King his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert? <hi>VICARIVS verò DEI estis in Regno,</hi> sayes he, <hi>You are GOD</hi>'s <hi>VICAR in your Kingdom:</hi> which Title now the <hi>Pope</hi> doth with as much arrogance challenge to himself, as here one of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors doth with modesty ascribe to the <hi>King.</hi>

For, as we read it in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, when any one came to take upon him the Government of a <hi>Wapentake,</hi> upon a day appointed all that owed suit and service to that Hundred, came to meet their new Governour at the usual place of their Rendezvouz. He upon his arrival, lighting off his Horse, set up his Lance an end (a Custom used also among the <hi>Romans</hi> by the <hi>Praetor</hi> at the meetings of the <hi>Centumviri</hi>) and according to custom took fealty of them. The Ceremony of which was, that all who were present, touch't the Governours Lance with their Lances, in token of a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: whereupon that whole meeting was called a <hi>Wapentake,</hi>
                           <pb n="112" facs="tcp:108529:75"/>
inasmuch as by the mutual touch of one anothers Arms, they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a confederacy and agreement to stand by one another. This fashion, they say, the <hi>Saxons</hi> took up from the <hi>Macedonians</hi> their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors. Others will have it from <hi>tac</hi> to take, and give this account of it, that the Lord of the Hundred at his first entrance upon the place was used to take the Tenants Arms, surrendred and delivered up to him by themselves, in token of subjection by way of Homage. Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Smith</hi> differs from both these; for he sayes, that at the Hundred meeting, there was a Muster taken of their Weapons or Arms; and that those who could not find sufficient Pledges for their good abear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had their Weapons taken away; so that in his sense a <hi>Wapentake</hi> is properly <hi>Armilustrium,</hi> and so called from taking away their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons or Arms, who were found unfit to be trusted with them.</p>

I am therefore rather inclined to <hi>Cowell,</hi> who tells us, <hi>Maritagium</hi> signifies <hi>Land</hi> bestowed in marriage; which, it seems, by this Law was to return to the Wife, if her Husband dyed before her. The word hath another sense also, which doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this place, being sometime taken for that which Wards were to pay to the Lord for his leave and consent that they might marry themselves, which if they did against his consent, it was called <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of marriage.</hi>

See <hi>Cowell</hi> in the word <hi>Gage.</hi> This in <hi>Latin</hi> is called <hi>Vadium,</hi> a pawn or pledge, from <hi>Vas, vadis,</hi> a surety. Hence <hi>Invadiare,</hi> to pawn or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a thing by way of security, till a debt be paid.</p>

Now there were three sorts of this <hi>Amende,</hi> the Greater which was like a full Forfeiture, the Mid-one at reasonable terms, and the Least or Lowest which was like a gentle Amercement. This distinction will help to explain the meaning of this Law.</p>
                        <p>L. 30. <hi>Per fée de Hauberke.</hi>] This in <hi>Latin</hi> is called <hi>Feudum Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berticum,</hi> i. e. <hi>Loricatum,</hi> sayes <hi>Hotoman,</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> that is, a Coat of Mail, when a Vassal holds Land of the Lord on this condition, that when he is called, he be ready to attend his Lord with a Coat of Mail or compleat Armour on. Now <hi>Haubert,</hi> as <hi>Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> tells us, properly signifies a High Lord or Baron, from <hi>Haut</hi> or <hi>hault,</hi> high, and <hi>Ber</hi> (the same as <hi>Baro</hi>) a Man or Baron. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these great Lords were obliged by their place and service to wait upon the King in his Wars on Horse-back with compleat Armour, and particularly with a Coat of Mail on: hence it came, sayes he, that the Coat of Mail it self was also called <hi>Haubert</hi>; though he doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acknowledge that the word is extended to all other Vassals, who are under that kind of Tenure. But then at last he inclines to think, that the true ancient writing of the word is <hi>Hauberk</hi> (not <hi>Haubert</hi>) as it were <hi>Hautberg, i. e.</hi> the chief or principal piece of Armour; and <hi>Berg</hi> he will have to signifie Armour, as he makes out in some of its compounds, <hi>Bainberg</hi> Armour for the Legs, and <hi>Halsberg</hi> Armour for the Neck and Breast: and derives it from the <hi>Saxon Beorgan, i. e.</hi> to arm, to defend. Add to this, saith he, that the French themselves (and we from them) call it an <hi>Haubergeon,</hi> as it were <hi>Haubergium.</hi>

                        <p>Lin. 33. <hi>From all Gelds.</hi>] The <hi>Saxon</hi> word <hi>geld</hi> or <hi>gild</hi> signifies a Tribute or Tax, an Amercement, a payment of money, and money it self: whence I doubt not, but the best sort of money was called <hi>Gold.</hi> It is from the Verb <hi>geldan</hi> or <hi>gyldan,</hi> to pay. In <hi>Latin</hi> it is <hi>Geldum,</hi> and not <hi>Gilda,</hi> as <hi>Cowell</hi> writes it. For this signifies quite another thing, a Fraternity or Company of Merchants or the like. Whence a <hi>Gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> that is the Hall of the Gild or Society: such as was once the <hi>Stilyard,</hi> called <hi>Gildhalla Teutonicorum,</hi> the <hi>Gild-hall</hi> for the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants from the Hanse-Towns.</p>

And thus I question not, but there are several houses called <hi>The Hide:</hi> for I know one or two my self so called, that is, the Capital Messuage of the Estate. Nor is it so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to this sense, but that it takes in all the Lands belonging to the Messuage or Manour-house, which the old <hi>Saxons</hi> called <hi>hidelandes,</hi> and upon some such account no doubt <hi>Hidepark</hi> had its name, as a Park belonging to some great House. Now as to the quantity, how much a <hi>Hide of land</hi> is, it is not well agreed. Some reckon it an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Acres, others thereabouts, by making it contain four Yardlands, every Yardland consisting of twenty four Acres. The general opinion is, that it was as much as could be ploughed with one Plow in a year, <hi>terra unius aratri culturae sufficiens.</hi> And thus it should be much what the same as <hi>Carrucata terrae, i. e.</hi> a Plough-land. From <hi>Bede,</hi> who trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it <hi>familia,</hi> they gather it was so much as could maintain a family. There is mention made of these <hi>Hides</hi> in the Laws of King <hi>Ina,</hi> an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before King <hi>Alfred,</hi> who divided the Countrey into <hi>Counties</hi> or Shires. And Taxes and Assessments were wont to be made according to these <hi>Hides</hi>; up as high as King <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s time in the year of our Lord 1008.

                        <p>Pag. 69. lin. 39. <hi>Three hundred Marks of Gold.</hi>] A <hi>Mark</hi> weigh'd eight ounces, and as <hi>Cowell</hi> states it out of <hi>Stow,</hi> it came to the value of 16 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> At this rate three hundred Marks of Gold come to five thousand Pound; and to every Bishop five Marks, supposing only ten Bishops, come to 833 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> which is a very unlikely summ in this business. 'Tis true, the value of it, as of other Coyns and summs, might vary. And so we find in <hi>Spelman,</hi> that an uncertain Author reckons a <hi>Mark of Gold</hi> to be worth fifty Marks of Silver. But then 'tis as uncertain, what <hi>Marks of Silver</hi> he means. For if they be such as ours are (and as they were in King <hi>John</hi>'s time) at 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> then a Mark of Gold will be of the value of 33 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> which is just dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the former value of 16 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> (which being resolved into Marks of Silver, makes but 25.) But in ancient times a <hi>Mark of Silver</hi> was only 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> so that fifty of them will make but 6 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> Another instance we meet with, where one <hi>Mark of Gold</hi> is accounted equivalent to ten <hi>Marks of Silver</hi>; which taking a <hi>Mark</hi> for 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> comes to 6 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> Another, where nine Marks of Silver pass for one Mark of Gold, in a payment to the King: which is just six pound. And these <hi>three</hi> last accounts agree pretty well together. Taking the middlemost of the three, <hi>viz.</hi> a Mark of Gold at ten Marks of Silver; thus the above named summ of three hundred <hi>Marks of Gold,</hi> that is, three thousand <hi>Marks of Silver</hi> amounts to two thousand Pound; and the five <hi>Marks</hi> to every Bishop (supposing but ten Bishops) come to 333 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> But if we take these <hi>Marks of Silver</hi> at 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> the account will grow much less. For ten such <hi>Marks</hi> are but 1 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> so that the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Marks of Gold</hi> at this rate will come but to 375 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling. But that these <hi>Marks</hi> of the ancient and lower estimate are not here intended, may probably enough be gathered from one passage more we find there, <hi>Centum solidi dentur vel marca auri,</hi> where, if <hi>solidi</hi> stand for shillings (for they may be taken for <hi>soulx</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> call them) a <hi>Mark of Gold</hi> is made of equal value with 5 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling.

Out of the Diocess of</hi> Canterbury <hi>seven pounds and eighteen shillings ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: Out of the Diocess of</hi> London <hi>sixteen pounds, ten shillings.</hi> And so of the rest. <hi>Yeoven at the old City,</hi> April 22. <hi>in the second year of our Popedom.</hi> There is some difference though in the account of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceses. For after <hi>Lincoln</hi> he leaves out <hi>Coventry</hi> and puts <hi>Chichester</hi> for <hi>Chester,</hi> 8 <hi>l.</hi> and then after <hi>Bath</hi> he puts in <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Coventry</hi> (with a mistake 10 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> for 5 <hi>s.</hi>) and leaves <hi>York</hi> last. Besides every body knows there are more Dioceses now than were then. This was <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Fifth that wrote this, and it was (our Author tells us) in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second. But <hi>Edward</hi> the Third in the year of the Lord 1365. and of his Reign 39. forbad these <hi>Peter-pence</hi> to be paid any more at <hi>Rome,</hi> or to be gathered any longer in <hi>England.</hi>

But there is a great deal of more difference still, as the account of the <hi>Knights fée</hi> is given by others. In one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript we read, that <hi>A Yardland contains twenty four Acres, four Yard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands make one Hide,</hi> (that is, ninety six Acres), <hi>and five Hides make a Knights fee,</hi> (that is, four hundred and eighty Acres) <hi>the Relief whereof is a hundred Shillings.</hi> Another Manuscript hath it thus, <hi>Ten Acres according to ancient custom make one Fardel, and four Fardels</hi> (that is, forty Acres) <hi>make a Yardland, and four Yardlands</hi> (that is, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and sixty Acres) <hi>make one Hide, and four Hides</hi> (that is, six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

But this is a mistake either of the Author or the Citation; it is six Shillings three Pence, which makes that just summ; from whence we learn also what proportion was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by the Lord in setting and demanding of the Relief upon the next Heir after his Ancestor's decease. Further in the Kings Writ, as <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> cites it, it is said, that twelve Plough-lands make one Knights fee: which, allowing to a Plough-land one hundred &amp; twenty Acres, amounts to one thousand four hundred and forty Acres. In the main, as to the value of a Knights fee, 'tis enough what <hi>Cowell</hi> tells us, that it was so much inheritance, as was sufficient yearly to maintain a Knight wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as to the various measure of Land (of which we have had a remarkable instance in this business before us) <hi>Spelman</hi> hath given us good reasons for it; since where the Land was good, they might probably reckon the fewer Acres to a Yard-land, a Hide, a Knights fee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and where it was barren, they might allow the more. Beside, that some Lords, who lett these Fees, might be more bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and profuse, others more parsimonious and severe to their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and that the services which were imposed upon these Fees, might in some Mannors according to custom be lighter, in others upon agreement and covenant more heavy.

This was the ground and method of our late <hi>Republican</hi>

policy and practice. Wherein yet they did not foresee what examples they set against themselves, supposing this Doctrine of the <hi>three Estates</hi> in their sense to be true, and that <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> had an equality of trust and parity of power, that the same outrage, which the <hi>Rump-Commoners</hi> acted against the King, to the destroying of him, and against the <hi>Lords,</hi> to the outing of them, and voting them useless and dangerous (as to their share of Government) might one time or other be more plausibly promoted, and more effectually put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by one or both of the other two <hi>Estates,</hi> with the help and assistance of great numbers of the <hi>Commoners</hi> (as there ever will be in such Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional divisions) against themselves and all men whatever of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and destructive principles. No. This false Doctrine, I hope, will never obtain among us; and our <hi>English Government</hi> is so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, that our <hi>Lords Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> and our worthy <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners,</hi> will find it the interest of themselves and their posterities, that they will ever have that duty and deference to our <hi>Soveraign,</hi> as may secure Him and Us, and discourage the designs, and defeat the attempts of all such as wish ill to his honour and safety, or to the publick peace. Besides, is it rational to imagine, that the <hi>King,</hi> whose abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute right by Law it is, to convene the <hi>Estates,</hi> when and where he thinks fit, to call and dissolve <hi>Parliaments,</hi> as he pleases: in a word, that He, in whose Name all <hi>Justice</hi> is administred, in whose Hands the <hi>Militia</hi> is, and by whose Authority alone the Subjects can take up <hi>Arms,</hi> should stand only in a <hi>Co-ordination</hi> of power with any other persons whatsoever or however assembled or associated within his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions?

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108529:83"/>
Justice, appears by the foresaid Book of <hi>Ramsey,</hi> where it is said, that <hi>Ailwin</hi> the Alderman and <hi>Aedric</hi> the Kings Provost sate Judges in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Court. The <hi>Alderman of the County</hi> our Author makes to be the same as the Earl or Lord of the County, and <hi>Spelman</hi> saith, it is hard to distinguish, but at length placeth him in the middle betwixt the Count and Viscount. He and the Bishop kept Court together, the one for Temporals, the other for Spirituals. The Title goes lower still, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a Mayor or Bailiff of a Corporation, a Bailiff of a Hundred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>Lin. 30. <hi>Healf-koning.</hi>] It was an oversight or slip of memory in our Author, to say, that <hi>Ailwin</hi> was so called; when the Book of <hi>Ramsey</hi> tells us, it was his Father <hi>Aethelstan,</hi> who was of that great power and diligence, that all the business of the Kingdom went through his hands, and was managed as he pleased, that had that Nick name given him therefore.</p>
                        <p>Lin. 36. <hi>The Graves.</hi>] Our Author makes them subordinate to the <hi>Aldermen</hi> of Counties: but in the Laws of the <hi>Confessor</hi> they appear to be much what the same. There we read, <q>And as they are now called <hi>Greves,</hi> who are put in places of Rule over others, so they were anciently among the <hi>English</hi> called <hi>Ealdermen.</hi>
                           </q> Indeed, the word <hi>Greve</hi> or <hi>Reev</hi> (for it is all one) is of as various use, as that other of <hi>Alderman</hi> is. In <hi>Saxon</hi> it is <hi>gerefa,</hi> from <hi>gerefen</hi> and <hi>reafen,</hi> to take or carry away, to exact or gather. Whence this Officer (<hi>Graphio</hi> or <hi>Gravius</hi> from the <hi>Saxon</hi>) is in other <hi>Latin</hi> called <hi>Exactor regius</hi>; and by reason that the <hi>Sheriff</hi> gathered the Kings Fines and other Duties, and returned them to the Exchequer, he was called the <hi>Shire-greve</hi> or <hi>Shire-reev,</hi> that is, the Gatherer of the County. But the truth is, that <hi>Greve</hi> or <hi>Reev</hi> came at last in general to signifie any Ruler or Governour set over any place almost whatever; as the same word <hi>Grave</hi> doth among the <hi>Dutch.</hi> So a <hi>Shire-greve,</hi> or <hi>hihgerefa,</hi> the High Sheriff of a County; a <hi>Port-greve,</hi> the Governour of a City or Port. So the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> was called formerly. <hi>Tun-greve,</hi> the Bailiff of a Town or Mannor. Sometime <hi>Greve</hi> is taken for a Count or Earl, as <hi>Alderman</hi> is.</p>

                        <hi>But notwithstanding those general forms of reformation, a more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and recapitulated was desired by the whole Baronage; A grand Council is appointed at</hi> Paul<hi>'s in</hi> London, <hi>and there by</hi> Stephen <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>is produced a Copy of</hi> Henry Beauclerk<hi>'s free Charter (which is before expressed) and the same delivered to the chief Clerk there, to be openly read &amp; pronounced. As soon as the Barons heard it, was a uniform consent, that maintenance and assertion of those liberties should rest, as of more dear account, in their Martial resolutions, than bloud or life. Nay in short space after, mutual combination by solemn Oath taken upon the Altar was made among them, that their band of Fealty dissolved (for so they deemed</hi> John<hi>'s Government had occasioned) their Swords should compel him to enseal their demands. To that place, which now only is called the Temple (then the new-Temple) where the King lay in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like order, they go to execute their designs; He binding himself with an interlocutory Sentence, and giving caution of future satisfaction, takes day until</hi> Easter <hi>following; But all was no less delusory, than dilatory: Nor any thing done with a face of composition, until the appointed meeting of the King and Barons (whose part hourly encreased) in</hi> Renimed, alias Runingmede <hi>near</hi> Stanes <hi>in</hi> Middlesex; <hi>whereof in the marriage of</hi> Tame <hi>and</hi> Isis, <hi>thus sings no small Favourite of the Muses;</hi>

                     <p>Nor in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times appears any thing that can sufficiently direct us to know, how it was exercised here, unless out of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Siwerth</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi>'s Testament, in the <note n="(c)" place="margin">In Bibliothec.

                     <p>But indeed it proves not so much.

                        <hi>Glanvill</hi> Chief Justice under <hi>H.</hi> 2. where he sayes, that <hi>if a Legacy be detained, the Executors or other friends of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stator, were to get the Kings</hi> Writ <hi>to the Sheriff, commanding quod justè &amp; sine dilatione facias stare rationabilem divisum,</hi> (that is, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest or Legacy). <hi>N. sicut rationabiliter monstrari poterit quod eam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Bastardy</hi> and <hi>Profession</hi> are to be certified, because within the Bishops Juris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iction. Some recorded Testimonies remain of the first and third, and the nature of the Marriage or Cohabitation (that directs in the second) is to be judged of only in the Spiritual Courts; so the <hi>Validity of the Testament,</hi> or the truth of this or that particular Legacy was to be certified from the Spiritual Court, because the Probate had there proceeded, and the Copy there remaining was most authentick; otherwise to what purpose should they have sent to the Spiritual Court in such a case?</p>
                     <p>But on the other side, as in the case of <hi>Institution, Profession</hi> and <hi>Bastardy,</hi> the consequence of them, which are objects of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal Jurisdiction, as <hi>Descent, Exclusion</hi> from Inheritance, gaining it by a descent cast, or legal making a Church full, or the like are determinable only at the Common Law; so the consequence of a Testament, that is, the Recoveries of Legacies, and such like, as it seems by that Writ, were in the Temporal, not in the Spiritual Court. I know the authority of that Treatise is suspected, and some of the best and ancientest Copies having the name of <hi>E. de N.</hi> which I have heard from diligent searchers in this kind of Learning, affirmed to have been sometimes <hi>E. de Narborough,</hi> and not <hi>R. de Glanvilla,</hi> it hath been thought to be anothers Work, and also of later time.

                     <p>That Extrinsecal Jurisdiction of those times in the Secular Courts, was perhaps denoted by those words in the Testament of <hi>Theobald</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> under King <hi>Stephen,</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108529:115"/>
we note out of <hi>Glanvill,</hi> concerning the Intrinsecal Jurisdiction at that time in the Temporal Court: for in an Appeal sent to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, the Case, as <hi>John</hi> 
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">Epist. 89.</note> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> relates it, was, that one <hi>Richard de Anestia in foro secularium Judicum petitionem haereditatis ad bona avunculi obtinenda instituit,</hi> against <hi>Mabile de Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villa,</hi> being Daughter to <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Sackvill,</hi> to whom the Plaintiff was Nephew by his Sister: and the point of the issue between the Daughter here and the Nephew, being upon the Bastardy of the Daughter, the Spiritual Court had the Tryal of it. If (<hi>bona</hi>) here be understood for Chattells, as in our Law it is, and so restrained, then was this <hi>petitio haereditatis,</hi> as a Suit for <hi>Sackvill</hi>'s Goods, grounded also, as it seems, upon a Testament of his: for in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Case also, <hi>Richardus insistebat,</hi> sayes the Author, <hi>institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioni Avunculi, petitionem haereditatis instituens;</hi> and on the other side, <hi>Mabile maxime Patris novissimae voluntati innitebatur:</hi> which shews, that here was a Testament in the Case, and a Suit for what was challenged by it in the Temporal Court: But <hi>haereditas</hi> and <hi>bona,</hi> it is likely, included here (as by the Civil Law) all possessions of the Ancestor, both real of Inheritance, and personal, that is, the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versum jus defuncti,</hi> and not only our inheritance; although it doth also amongst some <note n="(l)" place="margin">Barth. ad tit. de summa Tr. l. 1. num. 42.</note> Civilians denote no more, if at least they understand aright what they say, while they write, that <hi>consuetudo est in Anglia quâ primogenitus succedit in omnibus bonis:</hi> and in this Case, if the Issue had been upon the Truth of the Testament, as it was upon the Bastardy, it had been referred also to the Spiritual Judges.</p>

                        <hi>liber homo intestatus &amp; subito decesserit, dominus suus nil intromittat de bonis defuncti, nisi de hoc tantum, quod ad ipsum pertineret, (sc. quod habeat suum Heriott.) sed ad Ecclesiam &amp; amicos pertinebit executio bonorum.</hi> Yet it seems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that notwithstanding the right of the Church thus ordained, and the succession of next of kin so included in the Ordinance, both the Lords in some places, according to their former right, still usurp some power over the disposition of Intestates Goods, against the will of the Ordinaries: and on the other side also, the Ordinaries, instead of giving direction for a true disposition of such Goods, get possession of them, and commit them often, or at, least too great a part of them, to the use either of themselves, or of the Church, and so <hi>defrauded</hi> those to whom by the right of natural succession they pertained. For that of the Lords, <hi>Bracton</hi> his noting it as a thing denyed them, compared with what we find among Articles granted in the Synod of <hi>London</hi> held under <hi>Boniface</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in 42 <hi>H.</hi> 3. proves it, <hi>Idem quod mortuo</hi> (so is the <note n="(b)" place="margin">In Annal.

But also that the Ordinary did in this Age sometimes usurp the Goods of Intestates against the next of kin, is enough proved out of that Legatine Constitution of <hi>Othobon, cum mortis incerta, &amp;c.</hi> where it was ordained as you see before; so in the words of it, that they should not dispose of them otherwise than according as that Grant was in the <hi>Grand Charter</hi>; that is, to the benefit of the next of blood: But the Ordinaries had about this time, against the intent of that <hi>Charter,</hi> so abused the right of succession, that it was related <note n="(c)" place="margin">Innocent. 4. tit. de Simionia, c. ad Apostolicum.</note> for a constant truth, that the <hi>Custome in Britania</hi> was, that <hi>tertiae pars bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum decedentium ab intestato in opus Ecclesiae &amp; pauperum dispensanda, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Innocent</hi> the Fourth his words are, who lived and wrote in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 3.

Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipimus tibi quod blada &amp; catalla quae fuerunt Roberti de Insula &amp; Rossiae uxoris ejus defunct. in Wahall &amp; Brokeberge arestari facias &amp; salvo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodiri, donec discussum fuerit in curia nostra ad quem catalla illa pertinent, &amp; aliud inde praecipimus;</hi> but this is often enough seconded with other examples that have for the most part a mention of the Defuncts debts to the Crown, that it cannot otherwise be understood, but either as founded upon that Law of seising upon the Goods for debt to the Crown by Prerogative, or as an example (amongst many of other kinds) that discovers a more arbitrary course sometimes in proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than later time hath permitted. And according to one of those wayes (but the first that is upon the Statute of the <hi>Grand Charter</hi> is the fittest and most probable) must that also be interpreted, where <note n="(f)" place="margin">Claus. 17 H. 3. memb. 8.</note>

                     <p>But surely we must conclude, that if there were any such practice by the Officers of the Crown in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. to seise <hi>Intestates</hi> goods generally, it was not so much the Law of the time; for if so, the Records could not be but as full of examples of it, as the time was of the death of Intestates, which questionless were very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but some such temporary usurpation, as in 31 <hi>H.</hi> 3.
