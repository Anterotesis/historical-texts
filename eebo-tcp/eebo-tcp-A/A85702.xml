            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Humbly preſented to the High Court of <hi>PARLIAMENT,</hi> and the People of this Common-wealth.</head>
            <p>WHereas the people in this Nation called (though falſly) <hi>ANABAPTISTS,</hi> are repreſented as the onely men cauſing thoſe ſad, and much to be lamented troubles, that hath lately hapned in the Common-wealth; and as if they were ſuch, who would indeavour the ſetting up their own Intereſt and Religion, by taking away the Lives, and ſhedding the Blood of others; yea, and as if they were utter Enemies to Magiſtracy: Theſe, and ſuch like Calumnies, being by the Tongues of the Malicious, or Ignorant caſt upon them, we think it our duty, being as well as others concerned, to publiſh to the world our Innocency therein, though in this we have peace, that in our Conſciences we know, (the moſt high God bearing-us witneſſe) that in thoſe things we are wholly miſ-repreſented. And truly, in this we can rejoyce, (we knowing our ſelves falſly reported of, and reproached) that we ſhould be ſo accounted, conſidering that Gods People in no Age did eſcape ſuch foul Aſperſions: for who was accounted the <hi>troubler of Iſarel</hi> but <hi>Eliſha?</hi> and who a <hi>Peſtilent Fellow,</hi> and a <hi>mover of Sedition</hi> but <hi>Paul?</hi> We do therefore, in behalfe of our ſelves, declare, (before the Lord, who, ſhould we not ſpeake the truth, would be a ſwift witneſſe againſt us) to Magiſtrates and People, that all men may have a right underſtanding touching us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That we have not, neither do we deſire, or ſeek the Blood of any; no, not of our greateſt Enemies that hate us, and do, or ſhall deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe us: but deſire their good as our own, and believe it our duty to ſeek it by all lawfull means we can, deſiring to be found followers of Chriſt, who came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them, who accordingly laid down his life for his Enemies, and hath commanded us that we love our Enemies, and do good to them that hate us. And although we have been repreſented as men thirſting after blood, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to cut our neigbours throats; We do hereby declare, that we are ſo far from ſuch a wicked thing, and do ſo much abominate the thoughts thereof, that the Lord, who is our Record, knoweth that it is upon our hearts, as our bounden duty, to aſſiſt and defend the Nation, this City, and our Neighbours as much as in us lie, from ſuch violence, againſt whomſoever they are that ſhall at any time attempt it, if called thereunto by the Magiſtrates of this Nation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We do declare, that, as for Magiſtrates, we own them to be Gods Miniſters, and that they bare not the Sword in vain, but have their power given them by the Lord, to the end, they might be a Terrour to them that do Evill, and a Praiſe to them that do Well.</p>
            <p n="3">III. We Declare, that it's our Duty, enjoyned us by the Lord, to ſubmit to them in all things, and to obey every Ordinance of Man for the Lords ſake, <hi>viz.</hi> when they ſhall command things civil and lawful, then in thoſe things actively to obey them; and when they ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to do things relating to Religion, and contrary to the light of our Conſciences, then (though we cannot actually obey them) we ought (and doubt not, but through the ſtrength of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, we ſhall) paſſively obey by ſufferings, and that joyfully, when called to it, without reſiſting.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. We Believe, and Declare, that it's not our buſineſs to meddle with their State Affaires, or the Government of the Common-wealth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by them duly called thereunto, further, then according to the will of God, to pray that we may live a peaceable life under them, in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and honeſty.</p>
            <p n="5">V. We Declare, that the National Miniſters we diſown, as not being the Miniſters of Chriſt, and their ways and worſhip, as not the true worſhip appointed by Chriſt now in the Goſpel; and in particular, we declare againſt their ſprinkling Infants, and their cruel, and inhumane forcing of maintenance by Law, or otherwiſe from any: yet notwithſtanding, we declare, that we do deſire their good, and that they may injoy Common Freedom in the Nation, equall with others.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. We believe, and Declare, that all men whatſoever, ought to have their liberty in point of Conſcience; and that no Magiſtrate hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived power from Chriſt to puniſh for, or to compel any to this or that form of Religion.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. We do Declare, that we our ſelves, and all other of what perſwaſion ſoever they are, if found to walk contrary to the Juſt Lawes of the Nation, ought by the Magiſtrats thereof to be puniſhed, according to the demerit of his or their tranſgreſſion, and not in the leaſt to be tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. We Believe and Declare, That we ought not; yea, and that it were ſinful for us to maintaine our Religion by a Carnal Sword, or to aſſert any Spirituall cauſe or thing thereby.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We Believe and Declare, that all the kingdoms of the earth, are by right Jeſus Chriſts, and his Saints; and that <hi>He,</hi> and <hi>They,</hi> ſhall one day poſſeſs them, which ſhall be the <hi>Fift,</hi> and <hi>Laſt MONARCHY</hi> upon Earth; for which time we wait, as pilgrims and ſtrangers: and do again Declare, that in the meane time, it's our duty to obey the Powers that are, (as above ſaid) and not to aſſert his Kingly Power, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by any other Sword than the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God; and do hereby Declare againſt all ſuch as ſhall ſo do, as not owned by us in ſuch a practiſe: So far are we from ſetting up our ſelves, or aſſerting our Religion, by taking away the lives, or ſhedding the blood of any.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Becauſe that, dated</hi> December <hi>the 12. 1659. we cannot in all things cloſe with, Therefore, foraſmuch as</hi> we, <hi>who go under the ſame Notion with them of being</hi> ANABAPTISTS, <hi>thought it our duty to manifeſt our non-conſent with them, in their ſewing pillows under the elbowes of the Miniſters of the Nation; and their want of boldneſſe, to witneſſe againſt their Babyloniſh Worſhip; which is alſo the reaſon why we Declare againſt thoſe National Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, more than againſt any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Secondly, becauſe in that Declaration, bearing date</hi> December <hi>29. there is not every thing that was upon our hearts to Declare; yet, this we teſtify to all men, That what they do Declare, we own as avery honeſt thing, and in nothing diſſcent from it; but do Judge that they have uſed much plainneſſe, and manifeſted much fidellity to Jeſus Chriſt; and do beare the ſame teſtimony againſt the firſt, dated the 12. of</hi> December, <hi>as they do.</hi>
