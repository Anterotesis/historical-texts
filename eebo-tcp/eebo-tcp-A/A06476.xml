         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the good corue with their cockle, and the Gospell of Christ, with the doctrine of the Diuell. And these are they that call themselues Iesuites, but they rather deserue to be called Iudaites: for they follow Iudas in betraying, not Iesus in sauing. One of which number (as it shoulde seeme) hath made a pernicious booke in praise of the Pope and Papistrie, and in reproch of M. Nicols, lately conuerted from Papistrie to the Gospel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the Pope to his Prince. But it doth appeare that hee doubted his docttrine, els hee woulde haue set his name to his booke. Wherein also hee doth detract a booke by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Beseeching you to pardon mee for my boldnesse heerein, assuring your honour, that your common commendations, and the good will I beare you: hath made me to doe that, that discretion and modestie shoulde haue made mee refuse. But though my basenesse doth not deserue such a Iudge: yet the cause which is Christs doth craue such a one. Humbly requesting you (though your affaires be great and your leasure little) to reade and peruse the same as occasion will serue and time will permit. Trusting, that your reading thereof, will bee more delightfull than tedious, &amp; will rather recreate you than wearie you. And thus ceasing heerein any further to trouble your honour: I do wishe you in this life to bee guided by God, and after, to raigne for euer with Christ.</p>

               <p>You haue named him minister, a name of reproche, with many of your sect, but a Minister of Gods worde, and of the holy Sacraments, haue beene and will bee, esteemed with the godly, aboue Papisticall Priestes, maintainers and mumblers of the Masse, that is most iniurious to the death of Christ. If Christe had thought it had beene a name of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche, hee woulde not haue saide these wordes to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, It shall not bee so among you, but whosoeuer will<note place="margin">Matth. 20.</note> bee great among you, let him bee your Minister, &amp;c. The Angels of God were ministers, for they ministred to<note place="margin">Marke 1.</note> Christe in the wildernesse. Also Christe himselfe came to minister, for thus he saith, for euen the sonne of man came<note place="margin">Marke 10.</note> not to bee ministred vnto, but to minister, &amp;c.

If a minister were such a reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full name as you and your sectaries woulde make it, Saint Marke woulde not haue taken that name vpon him: for hee was minister to Paul and Barnabas, for thus saith the text,<note place="margin">Actes 13.</note> And they had Iohn to their minister, (which was Marke the Euangelist.)</p>
               <p>The holyest priest of the Pope was neuer made Priest in such order as S. Paul was made a minister, for if the Pope haue made any, yet hee made them priestes on the earth: but Iesus Christ him selfe made S. Paule a minister, yea and that out of heauen, which S. Paule reporteth him selfe say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I saw in the way a light from heauen, aboue the bright<note place="margin">Actes 23.</note> nesse of the sunne, shine round about me, and them which iourneyd with mee: when wee were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voyce speaking vnto mee, and saying in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe tongue, Saul Saul, why persecutest thou mee? it is harde for thee to kicke against the pricke. And I sayde who art thou Lorde? And he said I am Iesus whom thou persecutest, but rise and stande vpon thy feete. For I haue appeared to thee for this purpose, to make thee a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and a witnesse of those thinges which thou hast seene. Thus it is manifest that Iesus Christ him selfe out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen made S. Paule a minister.</p>
               <p>When you can showe mee that any of your priestes haue been made priestes, by a better man and in a better place then S.

And though you holde by the first name of our high friende and redeemer which is Iesus: yet wee holde by his seconde name which is Christ, much musing what Spirite should incense you, to leaue the auncient name of a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which many thousandes of martyres and other Godly and learned men haue most defirously embraced, and gladlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined: whom God hath euer since Christes time preserued, prospered and blessed, amonges which I neuer hearde nor readde, that any of them were called Iesuites. Whereof you may see a manifest proofe (if you will) by the prosperitie of our prince, her godly gouernment, her peaceable raigne, and her woonderfull Successe, who is the chiefe defendresse of vs and this our Christian religion vnder God, for reade all the Cronicles with the conference of tunes, and you shall not finde that euer any prince or kingedome haue been more blessed. Which prosperitie and blessinges, God doth not commonly bestowe vpon heretikes, as you doe terme vs: for on his enemies and Heretyltes, (I muste

And that the same may more plainelie appeare, by the prosperouse successe of the true Christians on the one side, and the euill successe of Gods Enemies on the other side: I haue by infallible argumentes and examples plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prooued in my saide booke called A persuasion from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie that wee haue the true religion, and you the wronge: euerie indifferent reader whereof cannot choose but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse.

I thinke therefore you haue chosen to bee called Iesuites of Iesus (which signifeth a Sauiour) the firste name of our redeemer Christe, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby to bee your owne Sauiours.

Though this before written may perswad you Iesuits, that this pope had all lawes and knowledge in his brest: yet it assureth vs Christians that he had no witte in his brayne, and though it teache you that hee was a diuine iudge: yet it doeth tell vs plainely, that hee was a very doite. Wherefore though you count M. Nicols but a seely Gammarian, yet if he had sitte in place of the Pope, he woulde haue giuen a wiser Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than he: and though you count his learning but feeble, yet he woulde not haue giuen such a feeble iudgement of the body of saint Denise as your Pope did. Yet euery one must beleeue, (that will not bee an heretike) that his iudgement was true, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he said y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S. Denis had one body in germanie, and an other in Fraunce. All this before written well wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and considered, howesoeuer you Iesuites iudge of master Nicols learning, wee Christians must thinke that some of your Popes had neither wisedome nor learning.</p>

Therefore if the trueth of religion depende of the nomber of them that are turned, then I am sure the religion of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is true, and all other religions are false. For none other religion in all the worlde hath so quickly, soddenly, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously encreast and sprung vp as the gospel. And further if you will make the trueth of your religion to consist by the turning of vs to you, why may wee not then as well say that the turkes religion is also true, for that diuers Christians haue and doe reuolt to the same:</p>
               <p>And as you say that many of our ministerie is returned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But as Christs disciples were false disciples, because they departed from Christ: euen so our men of the ministerie (bee they neuer so learned,) are false ministers and Apostatas, because they are returned from vs, whiche teache the same Gospell that Christ taught to his disciples.</p>
               <p>And whereas you boast that they that are returned from vs to you, are important learned personages, yet (if a christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may giue a Iesuite counsell) I woulde wishe you not to leane too muche to your or their learning, for great learning without Christ is nothing: but small learning with Christ is much God beholdeth the lowlie, not the learned. The blessed virgin Marie the mother of Christ saide, that GOD<note place="margin">Luke. 1.</note> looked on the lowlinesse (not of the learning) of his hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide. The hawtie and learned Pharisees were not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by Christ to be his Apostles, they had suche learning, that they thought scorne of Christ, as you with your learned important personages thinke scorne of the Gospell. And as the proud learned Pharisees said to the simple and plaine Iewes that beleeued Christe, in these wordes: Are yee also<note place="margin">Iohn. 7.</note> brought into errour? doe any of the rulers or of the Pha, risees beleeue on him but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people which know not the law, are accursed? So you with your important learned personages, may say to the common &amp; simple people


<pb facs="tcp:8194:36"/>
that beleeue the gospel, wil you be seduced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of Rome: will you be brought into the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of these heretikes of a newe religion: do you see any of vs that are important learned personages beleeue on their newe founde doctrine: none followe them but the common and vnlearned people, which vnderstande not the scriptures. Take heede therefore what you doe, for our most holy father the Pope hath not onely cursed them: but also wee holie Jesuites that holde on the blessed name of Jesus, haue with a great othe accursed them, and denounced them for heretikes. Euen thus you are in all pointes like to the proude learned Pharisees, that were the enemies of Christ, for that you boaste of your important learned personages, dispising our simple and small learning as they did. And as the common people of the Jewes that beleeued in Christe (whom the Rulers and Pharisees accounted accursed) was in the true way, though they saide they were in errour: Euen so our Simple learned ministers, and the common people that professe the Gospell, are in the true way, though you count them in errour, and you in errour though you bragge of the trueth.</p>
               <p>A great sorte of our ministers and of the cleargie (though they be not so learned in the Latine and other tongues as some of you Jesuites are, and other of your important lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned personages reuolted from vs, though we haue thankes bee to GOD a great sorte, besides no small number of young Jmpes that are able to matche you euery way) haue better knowledge and sounder iudgement in the scriptures then you haue.

Therefore heerein you thrcape kindnesse on them whether they wil or no, for I dare say thus much in their behalfe, that they had rather go to Rome for the popes purse, then for your pouertie. And if they goe to Rome so thicke &amp; three folde for your honestie (as you woulde faine persuade vs) then in my iudgement they make but a sory iourney: I hope that hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie is not so scarse in England, that for it they had neede to goe to Rome.

(Yea and that which you call honestie, I feare wil proue hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, disobediencie, or rather plaine traitrie,) which may goe well enough for dishonestie. Wherefore it were more wisdome to haue without trauell and cost honestie at home, then with painefull iournies and great expences to buie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honestie or rather treason at Rome. There are a great

You doe well to haue a good opinion in your selues, and for want of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to set foorth your owne honesties. But Saint Paule sayeth, Hee that prayseth himselfe is not allowed, but he whome the Lorde prayseth. 2. Corinth. 10. You are faine to report it your selues, least otherwise it should bee hidde and vnknowne. You doe as the vnshame faste guest did, that thought himselfe honester then any of the guestes beside, who looking a great while to bee willed to bee set at the vpper ende of the Table, and sawe that none woulde bidde him: hee without any more adoe, (as one more shamelesse then shamefaste) set himselfe downe and so tooke his place (without an Usher) at the higher ende of the Table. Which when the good man of the house saw, (perceiuing him to be more bolde then honest) made the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ende to bee the vpper ende, and so accordingly hee set and placed his guestes as hee thought good: whereby this man that woulde faine haue beene exalted, and that did set and place himselfe highest, without any remoouing was inforced to sitt lowest. So you, seeing none either will or can well prayse your honesties: (for there is no great cause, for that you haue chaunged your selues from beeing the Queenes Subiects to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes slaues, and from beeing faithfull Christians, to bee forsworne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites) haue dishonested your selues, as the vnshamefast guest did, by publishing your owne honesties.

               <p>You may see here, it is not the pride of the Pope, but the state of his place, that causeth them that make orations or preach before him to goe away without thankes. It seemeth there is a great difference betweene the Popes chaire and his consistorie, for the popes chaire is so full of wisedome and trueth, that the pope when he sitteth there, is full of learned talke, yea and can speake nothing but trueth, as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by his iudgement of the body of S. Denis: but the popes consistorie is suche a proude and stately place, that the pope as long as he sitteth there, dare speake neuer a word, or els is so doltishe a place, that he, whiles he is in it, is tongutied, or hath no witte to speake.</p>
               <p>Well, seeing the pope is so daintie of his thankes to his preachers, it shoulde seeme that he is verie daintie in bidding them to dinner. But for that the pope is called Seruus ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorum dei the seruant of Gods seruants, and hee taking his preachers for Gods seruants, whereby they must needs then be his masters: I muse that he is so farre ouer seene, that hee


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8194:43"/>
doth not bidde his masters to dinner, especially seeing they preach before him. But I must say that the pope is a stately seruant (if he be a seruant) that will neither bidde his masters to dinner, nor giue them once thankes for their Sermons. The pope belike would vse his seruantes but homely: that dealeth with his masters thus vncourteously.</p>
               <p>I perceiue it is not the custome of your holy and lowely Churche of Rome, that a poore preacher shall dine with a proud pope, seeing a proude pope may not giue a poore prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher thankes. But one woulde thinke, though the popes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is too hie for his preachers to sit at: yet the grounde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the popes table is lowe enough for them to lie on, where he may suffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to picke vp y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cromes that fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his table.

But parhappes the grounde vnder the popes table is not allowed for poore preachers, but onely for dogges and Dukes euer since duke Dandalus lay there. It may bee that the great vertue of the Popes chaire woulde quite bee lost, if the pope shoulde thanke them that make Orations, or preache before hym. Because the pope woulde not be like vnto Christ, therefore he is loth to be humble and meeke.</p>

And to ride it were very vnseemely and inconuenient hauing to passe through all Saint Peters great Churche, where the moste preasse is and also for the passages of stones and stayres. Wherefore they haue vsed alwayes, to lift him vp in his chayre, and so to conuey him through the multitude, and this is all the matter, which is so much exclamed at, &amp;c.

it, then conuinceth pride in the pope that admitteth it, or any fault at all in the well meaning Christians, who vpon so iust causes doe both desire and offer it. For that Christe is the best patterne to followe of all other, and did neuer vse such pompe to bee borne on mens shoulders, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the temple of Ierusalem nor in any other place, and because the Pope is by his owne saying but Christes Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car or Deputie: mee thinkes (if you goe to reason) that then the Pope should doe as his master did, and vse himselfe rather more humblie then his master, and not to passe in pompe and glory aboue Emperours and Kings, &amp; more like a Soueraigne then a seruant. You alleadge reasons and causes why hee shoulde bee thus caryed on mens shoulders: but there is a greater reason that hee shoulde not doe so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christe neither did so nor yet commaunded him to doe so. I can shewe you a good reason why the Pope ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to goe on his feete then to bee caried on mens backes, and that is this, God hath giuen vs feete purposely to goe on, and legges to carrie vs: but God created not men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to carry the Pope. and also heere is an other reason, Christ was neuer carrted on mens shoulders, then it is not meete for the Pope being farre vnder him to be carrted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times on mens backes: Christe went on foote in as great thronges of people as the Pope, then it is reason that the pope goe in as great thronges of people as Christe: Christe the sonne of God rede but one day in all his life, and that was but on an Asse, then the pope ought not to presume to ride many dayes vpon men. The Jewes had more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to see Christ then the people haue nowe to see the pope, yet Christe rode not on mens shoulders that men might see him but hee went a foote: but the pope because hee will needes bee vnlike Christe, hee is borne on mens shoulders for that hee woulde bee seene: the pope must needes ryde in a chayre on mens shoulders, or els you say he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently blesse the people: but Christ could helpe the blind, heale the lame, &amp; doe good to all people, &amp; yet went on foot, which did more good then the popes blessings, Little Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us<note place="margin">Luke. 19.</note>

because hee would see Christe, did get him by into a tree: But Christe got him not on mens shoulders because hee woulde bee seene of little Zacheus.

                  </gap>. It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hereby that the Popes blessing doth descende but not ascende, and falleth downe warde, but cannot goe vpwarde: So that if the people bee aboue the Pope, his blessing will doe them no good, but if the Pope bee aboue them, then it will doe them great pleasure, and so they shall neuer bee hungrie as long as they list not eate.

               <p>Surely the pope had neede rewarde you for finding out such a shift to keepe bp his stewes, you say if they paide a tribute, yet were it a punishment, and not an allowance of their life.

               <p>Whiche you, verye aduisedly, allowe for a punishment for their facte, and not as an allowance of their life, for this is your reason, When we make a Catholike pay money for his not comming to Church, we do not allowe thereby of his absence, but we punish him for it.</p>
               <p>This will prooue but a false Simile, though it showe faire at the first. You compare whoredome, which is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, to goyng to the Church to heare the worde of God, which is godlynesse. And so where wee paye money to the poore for not doing godly: your Curtezans pay money to the pope, for committing wickednesse. And further one may be absent and from the Church, and displease not God: but euery one displeaseth God that committeth whoredome. So that your Curtezans pay their money to the pope that they may sinne: but they that come not to the Churche with vs, pay money to the poore, because they doe not honour God. And thus if you marke this well, the paying of the whoores money to the Pope is to an euill end: but the paying of our money to the poore, is to a good ende. Therefore by these your former wordes, you thought to cast such a miste before your simple readers eyes, that the Pope doeth not euill in suffering the Stewes vp in Rome, nor in his taking money of them therefore.</p>

But marke this well, doe you thinke, if there were a streete or two of protestantes in Rome, that the pope woulde suffer them to vse their religion, for paying him a certaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Therefore if the pope shoulde allowe the preaching and hearing of the Gospell by taking of money of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes: Then the pope doth allowe whoredome in Rome by taking money of the Curtezans and harlottes there. And if the pope woulde not thinke it a due punishment for Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes to paye money to him for preaching and hearing the worde of God: then the paying of money to the pope by the Curtezans, can not be a sufficient punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for their whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is diuelishe and damnable. Yet you and the pope can be content to punishe whoredom with paying of money. and to suffer them still to liue in the same: But the children of God that professe the Gospel, and that doe abhorre whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, may not be punished by paying of money, but euen with paying their heart blood, and with the losse of their liues.

               <p>Diuers suche I coulde bring, but these are sufficient for a taste, for you may feele by these howe sweete the rest bee.

               <p>Thus though you woulde haue Christe and Saint Paul to defende and boulster the Pope, for suffering the stewes and Curtezans in Rome, yet neither Christe nor Saint Paule will serue your turne therein.

If al be true that you say, then it is so in deede, for you bring none other autour but your selfe, neyther any argument for proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the same.

<pb facs="tcp:8194:60"/>
but your Church of Rome (whiche you counte Christes olde spouse) hath and doeth lacke both learning wit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie as before it doth manifestly appeare.</p>
               <p>That pope was very full of witte, (which you counte the chiefe of your Churche,) that gaue iudgement and sentence, that they at Ratilpone in Germanie, and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay of Saint Denise in Fraunce, had both the whole bodye of Saint Denise at once as is before mentioned. He had more witte than Salomon, for Salomon coulde make but one childe into two halfe children: but your sayde profound and wise pope, made one Saint Denise into two whole Saint Denises. Belike the Pope thought that seeing euery simple and raskall priest coulde make Christes bodie at one time to be in many places: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he being the prince of al priests was able to make the body of S. Denise to be in two places.</p>
               <p>And further your olde spouse of Rome can want no wit, because it can not erre if it woulde, and no maruell, for it can haue the holye Ghost in the likenesse of an Owle to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structe it, for in one of your late Councelles in Rome as they were singing and roaring of Veni creator spiritus, that is<note place="margin">Nicol. de Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengiis.</note> Come holy ghost, &amp;c. by and by (at their becke and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) a poore olde Owle amazed with the noyse, (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belike shee was the holy ghost that they called for so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly) leapt out of the hole where shee sate, and came downe in the middes of them, and sate amongst them. Thus you may perceiue that there is a great difference betweene the Spirite of God and the Popes holy Ghost. For God the holy Ghost discended and appeared to Christe in likenesse of a faire white doue: but the popes holy ghost did discende and appeare to the Pope in the shape of a foule euill fauoured owle.

And these are your wordes concerning the same. Of late in the<note place="margin">Discouerie. Pag. 1 83.</note> middest of our persecutions, there came forth a waightie worke of 40 sheetes of paper, made by one Thomas Lup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, entituled a perswasion from papistrie, he woulde haue said a diswasion, but that papistrie and perswasion began both with a letter. I must needes confesse my sayd booke was not published very long since, it is so lately come forth, that it seemeth you had no leasure to peruse the same as you shoulde, for if you had red it as aduisedly as many haue done: you woulde not (I thinke) haue derided it as you haue done. You say, it came forth in the middest of your persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. It came forth at such time as it had pleased God to giue me his instrument leaue to finishe the same: for of my selfe, (I am most certayne) I neither began it, proceeded in it, neither fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished it.

               <p>But that it was in the middest of your persecutions I hardly can thinke, for that it were requisite that they shoulde beginne, before they be in the middest.

And though I coulde not sufficiently proue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but that there had beene some errour in this woorde Persuasion, and that the sense did require this word, Disua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, (whereby it ought to haue beene a disuasion from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie): yet you knowe, this worde Disuasion is seldome or neuer vsed especially among the common people, for whose sakes I made my said booke as wellas for the learned. And as I wrote it to allure Papists to Gods worde, so I made it to make protestants &amp; the simple people to shun papistrie. For euery one saith commonly vpon occasion, I persuaded him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> play, I persuaded him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drunkennes, I persuaded him from stealing, I persuaded her from folly, and such like: and not I disuaded him from play, I disuaded him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, I disuaded him from stealing, or I disuaded her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> folly, so that this is to be considered, that: Loquendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum cum multis, Sapiendum cum paucis.

Therefore where you write, I woulde haue saide a disuasion, but that papistrie and persuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began both with a letter, now do I write that you shoulde haue said disuasion, because dishonestie and disuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> begin both with a letter. And as you thinke that papistrie beginning with a P. did put mee in minde to say persuasion because it beganne also with a P: So I thinke that disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie beginning with a D. shoulde like wise haue put you in remembrance to haue saide disuasion because it began also with a D.

               <p>In this your disabling of my skill in the intitling of my said booke, thereby to bring your owne knowledge in credit, you haue gained as the vaine glorious Priest did, that (to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his own glorie in learning) controuled a young schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler<note place="margin">Marke this.</note> for speaking true latine. Which was thus, a man hauing a sonne at home with him whom he had put to learning, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very desirous, to know whether he had profited well or not: desired the Parson or Uicar of the Parish to examine and appose his said sonne. And then the said Priest (being both curious and vaine glorious) askt the young man what was latine for a Prieste? To whome hee answered, Sacerdos, no saide the Prieste, therein you are deceiued:


<pb facs="tcp:8194:65"/>
For who hath the chiefest learning or wisedome but priests: Therefore Sapientia is a very fit latine worde for a Prieste, wherewith the sober and wise young man held him content, then immediatly the Priest seeing a Cat, saide to the saide young man, I pray you what is latine for a Cat: The young man answered him that Catus was Latine for a Cat, no said the Priest a Cat hath very sharpe nailes, and therfore Asper is the right latine worde for a Cat: whom the young man did not contrarie. And the saide Priest as hee was sitting by the fire, askt the saide Scholler what was latine for fire: Forsooth said hee Ignis, that is not so saide the Priest, for when a man commeth in very colde, what maketh him more glad then a good fire: Therefore there is no fitter name for fire then Laeticia, all which words y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scholler kept well in his minde, but yet saide nothing. Then as they al walked abroade after in the yarde, the Priest espying a ponde or ditch with water, saide to the Scholler, what is latine for water: Then the Scholler tolde him that Aqua was latine for water, no saide the Priest you are wide, for as there is a merueilous great aboundance of water aswell on the maine lande as in the deepe and brode Sea: so the best latine word that can be for water is abundantia, and as they walked a little further the Prtest espying a barne, saide to the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, tell mee what is latine for a Barne: then the young man saide that Horreum was latine for a Barne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not so saide the Prieste, for what greater ioy can bee to a man than to see his Barne full of corne: Therefore Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium is the true latine woorde for a Barne. When the Schollers father hearde, that the Prieste contraried his sonne in euery thing that hee askt him, hee was very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie with his sonne and saide, all that hee had spent on him was in vaine. Sir said the Priest your sonne will do wel enough, he hath not yet the yeeres to atteine to our learning. And thus he made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> simple &amp; vnlerned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleeue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had controuled his sonne rightly, whereas he did it but to set forth his owne vaineglory (as you haue done). This young


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8194:65"/>
scholler remembring well the priestes new latin, thought to controlle him with an example without any argumentes, though the priest controlled him with blinde argumentes without any example, and so, soone after hee gotte a Catte and tied a fire brand at her tayle, and put her into the priestes barne that was full of corne, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had so done, he came to the priestes windowe and cryed aloude saying, O sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, sapientia, Asper currit cum Laeticia, &amp; nisicitius veneris cum abundantia, nunquam intrabis in gaudium. Which is by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priests own deuised latine, (but not according to true la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine) O priest priest, the Catte doeth runne with fire, and vnlesse thou come the sooner with water, thou shalt neuer enter into thy barn. But for that the priest had forgotten his owne latine, and tooke the same woordes truely as they sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in deede, whiche is O wisdome wisdome, sharpe ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with gladnes, and onles thou come the sooner with aboundance, thou shalt ueuer enter into ioy, the Priest sturde neuer a whitte, for hee had cleane forgot the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne deuised latine, whereby his barne and all his corne was burned. And thus as the priest gayned but litle, for controlling the Scholler when he sayde true: so you haue not gayned much in controlling mee for the intite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of my booke. And if it was a great fault in the priest to forget fiue words of latine which he taught the yong scholler: then it is a fowle shame for to forget one Englishe worde, wherein you controled me. And if it were a shame for the priest, for refusing his owne latine, wherewith vayne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously hee discredited the scholler to his father, and tooke the true meaning of the schollers woordes: then it can be no great praise to you to refuse your owne Englishe woorde, whiche you wrote vaynegloriously to diseredite mee to all the whole realme, &amp; to vse my word y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you reproued me for.

But you haue one great aduantage of mee, for you knowe my name and so doe not I yours, whereby with trauell and searche you may learne my estate &amp; calling: but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trauel &amp; search y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am able to make, I can not learne neither your state nor conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, because you hide your name. I thinke you haue left your name out of your booke because you would not haue vs learn your state and conditions. Though you knowe not my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for all you knowe my name: yet I thinke I knowe your calling though I knowe not your name. I take that your calling is to be a Iesuite and to bee one of the Popes sworne disciples: in which your calling though you reioyce, doubtles you haue a great cause to mourne &amp; lament, if you deeply wey and consider your execrable oth. I haue a calling also though not great in the sight of the world, (wherefore I thinke you esteeme my worke the lesse) Euen Iesus Christ the Sonne of God that called Peter and Paule and the rest of the Apostles, hath called mee. (I thanke his diuine Maiestie for it) where vnto I firmely beleeue that I was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before the foundation of the worlde according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of S. Paul, for we knowe (saith hee) that all thinges worke for the best vnto them that loue god, which also are called of purpose, for those which he knewe before, he also ordeined before, that they shoulde be a like fashioned to the shape of his Sonne, that he might be the first begotten among many brethren, And whom he appoynted before, them also he called, and whom he called, them also he iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, whom he iustified them also he glorified. Rom. 8. Which calling I take to bee no simple nor smal calling, nay it is a higher calling then to be called to bee eyther pope or

And for that Christe my heade (whereof through Gods goodnesse I am a member) is nowe in heauen and shall raygne as a king there for euer: then I one of his members and part of his bodie shall raigne for euer with him in heauen. This is my chiefe calling I thanke God. Now if I bee called to bee an inheritor of such a kingdome which is the kingdome of heauen passing all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kingdomes, then my estate can not be simple nor small: for he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath an estate of inheritance, in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as I beleue verily I haue through Iesus Christ) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test emperor hath no such inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on the earth, the fee sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the best Lordship in the world is not comparable to it.</p>
               <p>Nowe you haue learned both my estate and calling, which I my selfe haue tolde you, that you shoulde take no further trauell nor paynes, in learning my estate and calling: for it seemeth by your saying, that you meane to trie out my estate and calling, for that you say as yet you can not learne it, as though you doubt not but at length to find it out. Therefore briefly (to saue you some trauell) I me selfe haue shewed you my estate and calling.</p>
               <p>It may bee that this that I haue tolde you is not my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and calling that you are so desirous to learne, but my worldly calling and estate: which if you did knowe, then it seemeth you woulde worke wonders. For then belike you woulde confute my booke, which confuting, perhappes you keep in store vntill that time: Thinking belike it is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of confuting vnles it were made by some profounde lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doctor, or one that is of some great estate &amp; calling. But if young Daniel, though hee was neyther doctor of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, neyther of any great worldely estate or calling, both confounded and condemned the two learned wicked iudges that were of great estate and worldely calling, that sought the death of innocent Susanna: then why may not I, though I am neyther a profounde Doctour, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of any greate estate or worldely calling, haue


<pb facs="tcp:8194:67"/>
sufficient knowledge, to confute and confound with the word of God, your Iesuitical or papisticall doctrine and the popes deuilishe Doctors, that persecute, kyll and murther the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent members of Christ the professours of the Gospell: or els it may bee that the confuting of my sayd booke consisteth in the knowing of my calling and estate. You were best neuer learne my callinge and estate, and so you may haue a very good excuse, not to trouble your selfe with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futing of my booke. But if I thought you staied from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing of it for lacke of knowledge of my worldly calling and estate: I woulde my selfe describe the same at large vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, but I hope there is no such misterie, in confuting, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be found out of late by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sincere societie of the Iesuits.</p>
               <p>Yet that you may haue some better gesse of my calling and estate, I will say thus much vnto you (if it will doe you any pleasure) I am neyther preacher nor minister (I would to God I were apt or able for such a worthy function) ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prebendarie, deane, archedeacon, parson nor vicar, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue nor yet euer had, any liuing or worldly profite or commoditie by any of the same: Therefore I trust to escape the name of a notable and infamous liuer, wherwith of your courtesie you haue intitled our preachers and ministers.</p>
               <p>But if my not being a preacher or minister will not saue me from your slaunder, I must arme my selfe paciently to suffer it, for as long as I doe not deserue it, I care the lesse, (beseeching God that I doe not) I had rather a great deale you shoulde speake euill of mee then say well of mee, for this I am sure of, that you wilfull and determined papistes, and sworne or rather for sworne Iesuites, (as long as you are so) can not commende a good protestante nor disprayse an euill papist: therefore if you shoulde commende me, I must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a papist, from which God defende me, or you must bee protestantes, which I beseech God to graunt, wherefore I may reioyce if you speake euill of me, for then I am sure to be a professor of Gods woorde: but I may lament if you say well of me, for then I am sure I shoulde be a papist, and an enemie to the Gospell. If you coulde prooue that I haue

been a traytour, a murtherer, a drunkarde, a bearer of false witnesse, and maker of discorde, an oppressour or an extortioner or any such notorious malefactor (whiche I thanke God you can not) that shoulde not daunte me neyther make me once to shrink, but should cause me rather to reioyce not that I had been such a sinner, but that God of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse had called me, from being a fauourer of vice to be a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of vertue, and from a seruant of Sathan, to bee a childe of God.</p>

when you wrote this, or you neuer read my said booke, or els surely you do not knowe prose from rime. I thinke you doe take latin verses to be english rime, &amp; so you may haue some rime to charge me with all.

               <q>Viuere qui sancte cupitis, discedite Roma,<note place="margin">Perswasion from papistry.</note> Omnia cum liceant, non licet esse bonum.</q>
               <p>If these latine verses be the ryme you ment of, (for other<note place="margin">pag. 111.</note> rime there is not in all the booke) then I must needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that some part of my matter is rime, but not much of my matter as you say, vnlesse two lines bee much matter in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie sheetes of paper, and then the sheetes must be very small, or els the two lines must be marueilous great. I thinke in deede much of the meaning of my matter in the same booke, is conteyned in the sayde two latine verses: For all the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, blalphemie, pride, mischiefes and errours, that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you and all other from in that booke, is committed and practised in Rome, and therefore the effect of muche of my matter conteined in my saide booke, is comprehended in the sayde two latine verses, which belike you tooke for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe rime. And because I woulde haue you to consider the same well, I will now turne the same latin rime into plaine english prose: which is this that foloweth: All ye that would liue godly, get you away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome: for whereas all thinges there are lawfull, it is not lawfull to bee good.

               <p>This your refusing to obey the Queene, and to obey her enemie the Pope, is a more likely cause that you are no true subiectes: then my ryming (whereas I rymed neuer a whic) was the cause that I haue beene a musition.

in it shoulde thereby bee discredited: There is a saying not so olde as true, Scientia non habet inimicum praeter ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantem. Or thus, Tantum scientiae inimicus est ignorantia. The enemie of science is only ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which sheweth that your knowledge in musicke is not great, because you enuie the musition, and woulde haue my booke discredited because of my musicke.</p>
               <p>I neuer knew that it should bee a reproch to any for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowledge in musicke: but many haue been discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for their vnskilfulnesse in musicke. In disdaining mee for beeing a musition: you discommend thereby all mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, or that haue knowledge therin, or applie themselues to the sludie thereof. But though you goe about to discredit my booke by Iesuiticall coniectures that I haue been a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, yet I trust you will not discredit king Dauids booke of Psalmes (the Psalter) though he was a musition, for hee played excellently wel on the Harpe, and did sing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, which doth argue that he was a musition, and had skill in musicke. Your Priestes haue made fooles beleeue that your holy water woulde driue away spirites out of houses and men: But I am sure that king Dauids musick did ease<note place="margin">1. Kings. 16.</note> king Saule and thereby the euill spirite departed from him.</p>
               <p>Nowe if you will haue the Popes Priestes to bee esteemed and reuerenced for their casting of their holy water, which wil not driue away Diuels, but chase away myse: (as one of your friendes hath affirmed) then musitions ought not (by reason) to bee had in such derision that are skilfull in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous science of musicke, whereby the euill spirite departed from king Saule. You would make vs the worse because wee know musicke: but your musicke is the worse because you doe knowe it. For Dauid by our musicke droue a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill out of a man, but your misticall musicke filleth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes full of Diuels. It is saide that Orpheus had such excellent sweete and pleasant musicke, that with the melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of his Harpe hee woulde make dead stones to daunce, and seeme to bee aliue: but your Papisticall musicke, will


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8194:72"/>
make the liuing dead to Godwarde, yea and to die the second death. And moreouer it is feined by the poets that by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of musicke proserpina and the hellishe furies were brought out of hell into the earth: but you Iesuites with your mournefull musicke make the wise people of the earth to bee like furies, and doe driue them into hell: King Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid being the Prophet of God is as well to be credited as a Iesuite, who doth not contemne but commend, both musick and musicall instruments, (if hee doeth so, that doth vrge vs to sing and to play on the same) for these are his wordes. Reioyce in God O yee righteous: For prayse becommeth well the iust. Confesse it to God with the Harpe: sing Psalmes vnto him with the Viall and with the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tenne stringes. Sing vnto him a newe song, make a sweet noise with your musical instruments aloud. Psal. 33.</p>
               <p>Therefore it seemeth that you knowe not what musicke is, that woulde haue it to bee a discredite to the partie that knoweth it. I neuer read that Iesuitrie shoulde be one of the seuen liberall sciences: But I am sure that Musicke is one of the seuen Sciences, yea and one of the foure Mathematicall Sciences, whiche are, Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike, Geometrie, Astronomie, and Musicke, In whiche Sciences and other, it maye bee, that I am not altogeather ignorant, (though you goe aboute to discredite mee as without all knowledge and learning.) For as you confesse, that as yet you haue not learned my estate and calling: so I beleeue, as yet you haue not fully found out my knowledge and learning. And whereas you geste that I was a musition because of my ryming, In deede I must confesse, I am not altogether ignorant in musick, But if I were as ignorant in musicke, as it seemeth you are in the cause of my musicke: I shoulde then haue no more musicke, then there is truth in your religion. And nowe to put you out of doubt, I had knowledge in musicke before I coulde ryme. Therefore you might more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Musicke is such a science of concordance and vniformity, that one may soone vnderstand when the musition doth sing or play wrong. But when the Musition perceiueth by the discordes or by the tune or sounde, that hee is wrong, will he sing or play on still: No, hee will begin againe: And if his song bee false <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, he will neuer cease vntill hee haue founde the fault, and then hee will amende it, whereby hee will sing true. Yet you that are Iesuites (cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the musition) will not trie your Papisticall religion (which is most false and farre out of tune) by Gods worde: as the muisition doth his song, by the right copie or by the science of musicke: but wilfully against all godly harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, doe proceede still in your errour most greeuous to God, and quite out of tune to the eare of the Godly Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Therefore I woulde to God that you would trie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of your religion by Gods word: as the musition will trie his song by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> science of musick. And now to speake in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of musicke, though you seeme to disdame it: The truth is, in musicall harmonie is such strength &amp; vertue, that mens mindes being fatigated &amp; weeried are thereby made y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> stronger &amp; more apt to studie.

                  </gap>, their sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes their painefull labour seeme the more easie, and the time to bee shorter. Musicke expelleth care, it comforteth the sorowfull, and it deliteth men and women so much, that extreeme exercise in daunsing therwith three or foure houres together, will not tyre them or make them feele wearines:</p>
               <p>Whereas one halfe houre of easier exercise without mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, woulde vtterly tyre them. Musicke many times hath warmed mens mindes so much, that they haue felt no colde, though they stoode an houre or two in the frost. When no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can cause a childe to cease crying, a simple song will soone still it, and make it merrie, that before did mourne and weepe. Yea musicke is of such force, that birdes are catcht through the pleasure they haue in melodious whistling. The Elephantes of India are stayed with the musicall sounde of instrumentes. And moreouer as Alpharabius doeth testifie,<note place="margin">Alpharabius</note> musicke hath moued horses in the warres to bee curragious, and doeth merueylously comfort the Dolphins and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens in the sea and other.</p>
               <p>That great learned man Basill, seemeth to affirme that musicke is a meane (yea and deuised by the holie ghost) to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten the fruite of godly doctrine in vs, &amp; these are his wordes, For whereas the holy ghost perceiued that mankinde was<note place="margin">Basil, mag. in prolog. super Psalm.</note> hardly trayned to vertue, and that we be very negligent in things concerning true life in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And if they haue knowledge with al in Astronomie, they may know what signe and degree of the same, is ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; in the culme of the 10. house, or full southe, and other places, when they haue ended their song: So that they know perfectly at whattime they began their song. For as in euery artificial houre is conteined three score minutes, and in euery minute three score secondes, whereby there is in euery artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall houre 3. thousand &amp; sixe hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth seconds: So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the direct ascentions, one degree doth ascend in foure minutes whereby it falleth out, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 15. degrees doth so ascende directly in one artificiall houre not differing much: euen so one semebrefe of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lesse perfect measure, (w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is now the most accustomed time with vs of all songes) conteyneth the iust time of a second, whereby 60. se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breefes are a singing in one minute: so that according to this measure, 3600. sembreefs, as a iust houre a singing, and so the Astronomical second, and the musicall semebreefe, are iust both of one time.

Wherefore you defaced and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed my woordes, and foysted in your owne to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche, and to your owne credite (as you thought.) But as coggers and foysters of false Dyse thriue but sorily by their trade: so you by the chopping and chaunging of my words and foysting in your owne, will gaine but little. And as they for their cogging and foysting (when it is knowne) are so dispised, that the honest doe shunne them: so you, when this your subtill shifting is spied (for all you are a Iesuite) will procure your owne shame. Your Reader hauing any good consideration, will not thinke but that my woordes hang better togeather then you wrote them. But that your dishonest dealing may the better appeare, and that the indifferent and wise Reader may iudge whether 'I wrote so fondly as you haue affirmed, I will heere both write my very woordes that you so shamefully altered, and also the occasion and the circumstance thereof. For in this point I went about, not only to prooue her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But all this you left out, besides the marring of my sentences and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the reader might thinke, that it had neither good method nor matter. And now heere followeth my wordes.</p>
               <p>If he that counterfeateth the Queenes Maiesties seale<note place="margin">Persuasion from papistry Pag. 7.</note> for some priuate profite (breaking thereby but one part of her lawes) is a Traytour and is therefore put to death: Then are not you that are obstinate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient Papistes Traytours?

               <p>If heereby you will not willingly see what you are, I feare against your willes you will feele hereafter what you are. Open your eyes therefore and see what a mercifull Queene you haue, that euer since shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to raigne hath rather mercifully without lawe sought to winne you: then cruelly by lawe to enforce or wounde you. Thinke not because shee suffereth you, that therefore shee cannot punishe nor execute you, whiche if some of you sticke not to say openly: many of you (I beleeue) thinke the same priuilie. Thinke not because shee hathe made no lawe for you, that therefore shee can make no lawe for you: for the Queenes maiestie hath as great power to punish the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Papistes in her Realme, as king Iosia had to burne the Priestes of Baall in his Realme. King Asa and his people made a couenant and swore not only to

And if GOD was well pleased with king Asa for making and perfourming of that couenant (as hee was in deede): would hee then bee angrie thinke you, with Queene Elizabeth if she made the like and perfourmed it? I thinke not. But our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Queene (though shee hath set foorth the true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>But consider this well, if the Pope (not appointed by Gods lawe to raigne and rule as hee hath doone) may murther and kill (as many of you thinke hee may) the professours and followers of Gods worde (beeing not his subiectes) for disobeyiug his lawe deuised and inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by man on earth, and procured by the Diuell: Then may not wee thinke, that our Queene appointed by God and allowed by his worde to raigne ouer vs, may lawfully kill and put to death the Idolatrous Papists her subiects, for wilfully disobeying and withstanding the law of God that came from heauen, beeing long since taught by the Prophetes, by Iesus Christe the sonne of God and by his Apostles, mooued and procured thereto by God the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoste?

               <p>These comparisons duly considered, your Queene Mary did not muche excell our Queene Elizabeth (vnles in crueltie and burning her harmelesse subiects). Nowe if Queene Mary might put to death her humble and harmelesse subiects for professing of Gods word: Then I cannot see but that our Queene Elizabeth, may as well execute her stubborne and disobedient subiects (whiche shee as yet neuer did) that withstande Gods woorde, and will needes followe papistrie and idolatrie.</p>
               <p>And further, if Queene Mary had a lawe to burne the seruantes of God, that were obedient to her concerning their worldly dutie, and neuer ment her harme: Then why may not our Queene Elizabeth make a

               <p>Therefore be thankefull to God that hath giuen you and vs such a mercifull prince to raigne ouer vs, and loue and obey her, that giueth you for iustice mercie, and for extremitie lenitie.

And as I sayde, thinke not that her grace can not vse the swoord against you, because shee hath not vsed it: for if you thinke so, you do not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue your selues, but also do much abuse her Maiestie, in that you seeme thereby to make her a Prince without powre: whereby you are vnwoorthie of the great mercie shee sheweth vnto you.</p>
               <p>What seruant is so foolishe to thinke (muche more to say) that because his master doeth not beate him for his fault, therefore he can not beate him? Because the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull father doth not beate his sonne for his offence, that maketh not that he can not beate him for the same. Shall her clemencie and mercie make you thinke in her disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie? Therefore if any of you thinke so (as I beleeue some of you haue said so, you are not worthie of such a merciful mistres that vseth you so.</p>

Though you discommende and discredite it is as much as you may.

Unlesse one bee profoundely learned you make noe accoumpt of him: but howe so euer you count learning, I am sure that godlye knowledge, not curious cunning, and the trueth not the tongue, will guide vs to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>Yet if you goe to learning, there are a great sort of wise and learned doctours in this realme that are able to teache and turne your Romishe doctours, especially in true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and learning: but be like you thinke our Englishe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours are vnlearned, else you woulde not compare mee that am without all witte and learning to an Englishe doctoure. They are very muche beholden to you, for hereby you goe about, to make them eyther no Englishemen: or els to bee without all wit and learning. But as it is too much for you to prooue, so I am sure it will bee harde for you to proue them no Englishemen. For though you can bee contente to forsake your Prince and your Countrey for the pope, and so of a true Englishman, to become a false Romaniste: yet they I am sure will sticke to their Prince and continue in their Countrey, detesting the Pope and his practises.</p>
               <p>But though you turne from your prince and countrey, yet you can not turne your selfe from being an English man, for though you may chaunge your conditions, yet your natiue countrey can not be chaunged.

Therefore nowe it standeth at your curtesie, whether you will bee a lyar to make them all learned: or to tell truth and make them all fooles.</p>
               <p>Truly you beeing a Iesuite write very vnaduisedly and preposterously, for you call mee a Doctor and yet you say I am vnlearned, that is, indoctus. Wee Christians doe vse to haue men docti, learned, before wee make them Docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that is teachers: but you Iesuites can make men Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores, teachers, before they bee docti, or learned. Belike you had this power of Pope Iohn the 13. For as hee made Boyes Bishops for money and Deacons in a stable before they had wit: so you haue made mee a Doctor before I haue learning. But though you haue made me a doctor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet vpon your bare worde I dare not aduenture to bee a Doctor or teacher before I bee learned: So that as one that woulde faine learne, I will content my selfe with the name of a simple scholler, giuing my title of a Doctor to you that are so profoundly learned. Yet sor all your great wit and deepe learning, if you haue all the wisdome &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the worlde without the Gospell of Christ, you haue nothing: and if wee haue none other learning but the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, wee haue learning enough. For if the best learning the Prophetes of God had was, thus saith the Lorde: then what better learning can wee Christians haue, then thus saith Christe. Therefore though you Iesuites do bragge and boast of your great knowledge and learning, yet wee Christians can reioyce in nothing, but in Christe and in the knowledge of his Gospell: well assured that the small learning of a Christian, shall bee able to conuince the greate and profounde learning of a Iesuite.

               <p>These people are the most blessed that haue the greatest faith, not the most learning: Wherefore if I heare and followe Gods worde, I care not though you disdaine mee for want of learning, for my want of learning, cannot bee so great a reproche to mee before men: as your want of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> true knowledge of the Gospell &amp; perfect faith in Christe, is before God. Therefore you haue not so great a cause to discommende or deride mee for want of wit and learning: as I haue cause to lament you for want of true knowledge in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Gospell and perfect faith in Christ. God accepteth faith more then learning, though you regard learning more then faith. Christe marueiled at the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s faith, not at his learning (whose seruant he healed) &amp; saide to him goe thy way, &amp; as thou beleeuest so be it vnto<note place="margin">Math. 8</note> thee. hee saide not, according to thy learning so bee it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.

Antiquitie is no credite to an cuill writer, neither late yeeres can bee any discredite to a good writer. Time ought not to be preferred before truth, but truth before time. Christes and his Apostles words were as true and good fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundreth yeeres since as they bee nowe: Therefore the long continuance of the time since, maketh not their wordes the truer, or their authoritie the better.

But contrarie say I that the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>And vpon the commandement of committing adultrie, I write thus: And whereas God saith, Thou shalt not com mit adultrie, nowe the iudgement of the Pope and the<note place="margin">Pag. 131.</note> church of Rome is changed, and therefore Gods iugde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

is changed. So that this law by the iudgemét of the church of Rome must now be thus, thou shalt not marry, but thou maiest haue a concubine or a harlot, to commit adultrie or fornication withall, &amp; thou shalt haue a licence for money of the Pope to do so, and so he shall allow thee to commit adultrie or to play the whoremonger or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, but take heede thou marry not according to the lawe of God, for then thou shalt loose all thy liuing, and thou shalt be taken for an heretike, and the Pope will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence with thee therefore.

But as (according to your wont) you haue written my words other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then I wrote them: so you left out those wordes both before and after them, which openeth the sense thereof, neither haue you declared how I compared the Popes fast and Christes fast together, but because you haue written the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both falsely and left the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nakedly, to make your reader haue an euill opinion in me, &amp; to discredite my booke: I wil here vtter mine owne wordes that they may shewe whether they are so without order, sense, or good meaning, as you haue gone about to make them. And thus they are as followe. And as this Romish Churche hath with her most wicked prayer, blotted out the pure and perfect order of praying<note place="margin">Pèrsua. from papistrie.</note> which Christe did teach in the scriptures: euen so she hath with her vaine, fond, and superstitious fastings quite bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed<note place="margin">Pag. 170.</note> the true fasting required by the Gospell. For Christe in the Gospel saith, When yee fast be not sad as the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are, &amp;c. But when thou fastest appeare not vnto<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> men to fast, but vnto thy father which is in secret, and thy father which seeth in secret, shal reward thee ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly. Heere Christ doth appoint vs that we must not let it be knowen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we fast, but the popes fast is published, &amp; the dayes so commonly and openly commaunded &amp; appointed, that euery one may know when they fast. So that Christe hath


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8194:97"/>
appointed his fasting so priuily: but the Church of Rome proclaimes her fastes as openly. Christ hath appoynted no dayes nor times for his fasting: The Church of Rome hath appointed dayes and times for her fasting. The meaning of Christes fasting is to absteine from what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer either meates or drinkes that make vs prone to sinne: The popes fast is to forbeare flesh onely, but permits men to eate all kinde of fishe though it bee neuer so dayntie &amp;<note place="margin">These are the words that both falsely &amp; nakedly you haue chopt in so far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne place &amp; out of order.</note> deliciously drest, and all kinde of iunkettes and banketing dishes, with delicate wines, as muche as wee will cramme and powrein: Christes fast is to keepe our bodies lowe, to bee in subiection to the spirite: But that is not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the popes fast, but by their daintie dishes and drinkes, the Spirite is brought in subiection of the body. Christes fast is a willing and an vncompelled, abstinence: The popes fast is a constrayned abstinence, and is done of many against their wills. Christes fasting is to make vs ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and holy before god: The popes fast is hypocritical, and to make vs seeme holy before men. This is difference enough to shewe you that the Christian fasting of Christe, and the common fasting of the Pope, are farre vnlike and do not agree, so that the one shall haue his rewarde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after of God, and the other hath his rewarde alredy of men &amp;c.</p>

For if one that clippeth or diminisheth the Queenes coyne, whereon her Image or picture is but printed or stampte, is worthily called a traytor, and by lawe therefore is hanged, drawen and quartered: Then are not you woorthy to bee called traytours and deserue death, whiche procure, wishe or desire, by any meane, the displasinge of your prynce, the destruction of her person, the alteration of our moste quyete and happie state, the calamitie of your Countreymen, the confusion of the common wealth, and the ruine of this our worthy realme of Englande.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:8194:100"/>
you hate mee for telling of trueth: you woulde haue your reader dispise mee, as one that doth lie.

If you sought as muche for the fauour of God, as you desire the vaineglory of the worlde: you would not vse lying, which you seeme to dispise, nor yet such falshood which God doth detest. But as your doctrine is diabolicall, so are your doinges hipocritical. You knowe what place is prepared for lyers well enough, God keepe both you and vs from it. He that knoweth his masters will and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes: then you that bring the Scripture against lyers in the firste side of your booke, and vse lying and manifest falshood so oft in your booke, (vnlesse you repent and amende) are not like to bee beaten with fewe stripes. It is easie to perceiue whose part you take, for if you tooke Gods part which is the father of trueth, he would guide you in trueth: but seeing you take the Diuels part which is the father of lyes, hee leades you to lying: therefore if you loue God tell the trueth, and if you hate the diuell, flye falshood.

But I must tell you this by the way, that there where you pickt out this myracle, I talkt chiefly of the popes pride, and not of any myracles, and therefore the more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> for a myracle, if my matter had any good method. And these are my very wordes, which shewe the occasion why I wrote this great myracle of the dogges kissing of the Popes foote.</p>
               <p>Pope Adrian saith of himselfe whatsoeuer the Emperor<note place="margin">Persua. from papistrie.</note> hath, he hath it of vs, it is in our power to bestow the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire on whome wee list. (It may bee so but one may looke<note place="margin">Pag. 90.</note> all the bible ouer, ere hee can finde it). And also the Pope<note place="margin">Auentinus in Adriano.</note> hath made it heresie (though Christ did not make it) for a king not to hold his kingdome at his handes, &amp;c. The Pope if we may credite his prerogatiue, being of his owne penning, is of no small power: for hee is called Lorde of Lordes and king of kinges, hee compelleth Emperours and Princes to sweare fealtie and obedience to him.</p>
               <p>Cardinall Zabarella saith: the Pope doth what him<note place="margin">Stanislaius Orichouius in Chinera Fol. 97.</note> listeth, yea though it be vnlawful, and is more than a god,


<pb facs="tcp:8194:103"/>
(you called it Luptons lyes before, because I wrote that the Pope was called our Lorde God the Pope, but heere one of the Popes owne Cardinalles hath out lyed me, for hee saith that the Pope is more then a God). And one saith, that a Prieste is so much aboue a king, as a man is aboue a beast: as much as God is better than a priest, so muche is the priest better than a king: hee that setteth a king before a priest, setteth the creature before the Creator. By this it appeareth that priestes are no small fooles. If this be true, then it is no maruell that men were wont to haue priestes in great estimation and reuerence.</p>
               <p>But I maruell that king Iosias was so bolde to burne such a number of Priests that were so farre his Superiors, and that were as farre aboue him, as hee himselfe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a beast. Truly I thinke it was because they could not shewe him their Commissions, belike the lefte them at home. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And nowe marke I pray you? whether these wicked Popes before mentioned with many other that call them selues Christes vicars, are not more like Lucifer the Diuell in pride, then Christe the sonne of God in humilitie? I thinke there was neuer such Lordlinesse or pride in any worldly prince, as hath beene in diuers of these wicked Popes: for the Pope suffereth the Emperour (which is the chiefe rular of all Christendome) to holde his stirrop, to holde his horse by the bridle, to beare his traine, and to kisse his feete. Yea and the Emperour was shent of Pope Hildebrand, because he held the left styrrop in steede of the right when hee got vpon his horse: there was neuer Emperour nor king, that euer reciued any such seruice of any of the popes.</p>

Doe you thinke that an Earles dogge may not come into a Popes chamber: or that a dogge cannot bee so luckie, as to haue one licke at a popes foot: What if GOD would haue vs to vnderstand, that a dogge was as meete to kisse the popes foote: as an owle was fit to bee the popes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost:</p>

Therefore all wise men may well thinke, that the popes foote was more meete to bee kist of the Earle of Wiltshires dogge then of him selfe.</p>
               <p>And whereas I haue neither made this a myracle, neither written it for a myracle, you thought to make it a myracle, by foysting in your owne wordes, which did cleane turne and chaunge my sense, for whereas I say, But also snatcht at his great toe, thinking belike it was more meete to be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of dogges than to be kissed of men: You haue written thus, but also snatched at his great toe, signifiyng thereby that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

At the sight whereof there followed such an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crie of the people, and especially of them which vnderstoode the matter, that the like commonly hath not been hearde, and so this blessed seruant of God, strayght way synking downe into the fire, gaue vp his Spirite.</p>
               <p>If you had been as quicke a sighted Christian as you were a blinde Iesuite, and as pure a Protestance as you were a peruerse papist, you woulde haue seene this maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous myracle, and not haue ouerleapt it so farre backwarde.

Belike it was eyther to bright for your dymme eies to beholde, for that you made suche haste to the dumbe dogge of an Erle: that you had no leasure to staye and beholde the Seruaunt of God.</p>
               <p>Thus if you had been as well willing to make but halfe a steppe as it were eyther backwarde or forwarde, as you were of set purpose wilfully bent, to make such an vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable leape backewarde, you might haue been easely spedde of better &amp; truer myracles then of the Earle of Wyltshires Dogge.
