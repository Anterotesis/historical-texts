            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
University of Oxford.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend and Learned Sirs,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THESE Discourses (most of them
at least) having by the favour of
your <hi>Patience</hi> had the Honour of
your <hi>Audience,</hi> and being now Published in
another and more lasting way, do here humbly
cast themselves at your Feet, imploring the
yet greater <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of your
Patronage, or at least the <hi>Benevolence</hi> of
your Pardon.</p>
            <p>Amongst which, the Chief Design of some
of them is to Assert the Rights and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our Excellently Reformed Church,
which of late we so often hear Reproached
(in the modish Dialect of the Present Times)
by the Name of <hi>Little Things;</hi> and that
in order to their being laid aside, not onely as
<hi>Little,</hi> but <hi>Superfluous.</hi> But for my own
<pb facs="tcp:107166:3"/>
part, I can account nothing <hi>Little</hi> in any
Church, which has the stamp of undoubted
Authority, and the Practice of Primitive
Antiquity, as well as the Reason and Decency
of the Thing it self, to warrant and support
it. Though, if the supposed <hi>Littleness</hi> of
these matters should be a sufficient Reason for
the laying them aside, I fear, our Church will
be found to have more <hi>Little Men</hi> to spare,
than <hi>Little Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have observed all along, that while
this <hi>Innovating</hi> Spirit has been striking at
the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of our Church, the same
has bin giving several Bold, and Scurvy
strokes at some of Her <hi>Articles</hi> too: An
Evident Demonstration to me, that whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Her <hi>Discipline</hi> shall be destroyed, Her
<hi>Doctrine</hi> will not long survive it: And I
doubt not but it is for the sake of This, that
the former is so much maligned and shot at.
<hi>Pelagianism</hi> and <hi>Socinianism,</hi> with several
other Heterodoxies Cognate to, and Dependent
upon them, which of late with so much Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Scandalous <hi>Countenance,</hi> walk
<pb facs="tcp:107166:3"/>
about daring the World, are certainly no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And
none are abler and fitter to make them appear
<hi>what they are,</hi> and <hi>whither they tend,</hi>
than our Excellent, and so well stocked Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities;
and if these will but bestirr them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against all <hi>Innovators</hi> whatsoever, it
will quickly be seen, that our Church needs
none either to fill Her Places, or to defend
Her Doctrines, but the <hi>Sons</hi> whom she Her
self has <hi>brought forth</hi> and <hi>bred up.</hi> Her
Charity is indeed Great to Others, and the
Greater, for that she is so well provided of
all that can Contribute either to Her Strength
or Ornament without them. The <hi>Altar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
and protects such as fly to it, but
needs them not.</p>
            <p>We are not so Dull, but we perceive who
are the Prime Designers, as well as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Actors against our Church, and from
what Quarter the Blow chiefly threatens us.
We know <hi>the Spring</hi> as well as we observe
<hi>the Motion,</hi> and <hi>Scent the Foot</hi> which
pursues, as well as <hi>see the Hand</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:107166:4"/>
is lifted up against us. The <hi>Pope</hi> is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Workman; He knows his <hi>Tools,</hi> and
knows them <hi>to be but Tools,</hi> and
knows withall <hi>how to use</hi> them, aud that so,
that they shall neither know who it is that
uses them, or what he uses them for; and
we cannot in reason presume his Skill now in
<hi>Ninety-three,</hi> to be at all less than it was
in <hi>Forty-one.</hi> But God, who has even to
a Miracle, protected the Church of <hi>England</hi>
hitherto, against all the Power and Spight
both of her open and concealed Enemies, will,
we hope, continue to protect so Pure and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
so Innocent, and Self-denying a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
still. And next, under God, we must
rely upon the Old Church of <hi>England-Clergy,</hi>
together with the <hi>Two Universities,</hi> both to
Support and Recover Her declining state.
For so long as the <hi>Universities</hi> are Sound,
and Orthodox, the Church has <hi>both Her
Eyes open;</hi> and while she has so, 'tis to be
hoped, that she will <hi>look about Her;</hi> and
consider again and again, what she is to
<hi>change from,</hi> and what she must <hi>change
<pb facs="tcp:107166:4"/>
to,</hi> and where she shall <hi>make an End of
Changing,</hi> before she quits her Present
Constitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Innovations</hi> about Religion are certainly
the most Efficacious, as well as the most Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
way of compassing a Total Abolition of
it. One of the best and strongest Arguments,
we have against Popery, is, That it is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation</hi>
upon the Christian Church; and if
so, I cannot see why that, which we explode
in the <hi>Popish Church,</hi> should pass for such
a piece of Perfection in a <hi>Reformed One.</hi>
The Papists, I am sure, (our shrewdest and
most designing Enemies) desire and push on
This to their utmost; and for that very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
one would think, that we (if we are
not besotted) should oppose it <hi>to our Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi>
too. However, let us but have our
<hi>Liturgy</hi> continued to us, as it is, till the
Persons are born, who shall be able <hi>to mend</hi>
it, or make a <hi>Better,</hi> and we desire no greater
security against either the <hi>altering This,</hi> or
<hi>introducing Another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:107166:5"/>
The Truth is, such as would new model
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ought not onely to
have a <hi>New Religion</hi> (which some have
been so long driving at) but a <hi>New Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
likewise, to proceed by: Since <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
(which was ever yet accounted one of
the surest and best Improvements of Reason)
has been always for acquiescing in Things
settled with sober, and mature Advice, (and, in
the present case also, with the very Blood and
Martyrdom of the <hi>Advisers</hi> themselves) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
running the Risque of New <hi>Experiments;</hi>
which, though in Philosophy they may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
yet in Religion and Religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are generally fatal and pernicious. The
Church is a <hi>Royal Society</hi> for settling <hi>Old
Things,</hi> and not for <hi>finding out New.</hi>
In a word, we serve a <hi>Wise,</hi> and <hi>Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
God, and we desire to do it, by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and in a Church (as like Him, as
may be) without <hi>Changes,</hi> or <hi>Alterations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, as in so Important a matter,
I would Interest both Universities, so I do it
with the same Honour and Deference to
<pb facs="tcp:107166:5"/>
Both; as abhorring from my Heart the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick
Partiality of preferring one before
the other: Since (if my Relation to One
should never so much encline me so to do) I
must sincerely declare, that I cannot see how to
place a <hi>Preference,</hi> where I can find no <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence.</hi>
And therefore, as they are
both Equal in Fame, and Learning, and all
that is Great and Excellent, so I hope to see
them always one in Iudgment and Design,
Heart and Affection; without any Strife,
Emulation, or Contest between them, except
this One (which I wish may be perpetual,)
<hi>viz.</hi> Which of the <hi>Two Best Universities
in the World,</hi> shall be most serviceable
to the <hi>Best Church in the World,</hi> by their
Learning, Constancy, and Integrity.</p>
            <p>But to Conclude, There remains no more
for me to doe, but to beg Pardon of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
Body, to which I belong, if I have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in assuming to my self the Honour of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
my Relation to a Society, which I could
never reflect the least Honour upon, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
the least Advantage to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:107166:6"/>
All that I can add, is, That as it was my
Fortune to serve this Noble Seat of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for many years, as Her <hi>Publick,</hi> though
Unworthy <hi>Orator;</hi> so upon that, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
other Accounts, I ought for ever to
be, and to acknowledge my self,</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>AS it were easy to Evince, both
from Reason and Experience,
that there is a strange, restless
Activity in the Soul of Man, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
disposing it to Operate, and Exert
its Faculties; so the Phrase of Scripture
still expresses the Life of Man by <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
that is, it represents an Active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
in an Active Posture. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Nature of Man carries him
thus out to Action, it is no wonder if
the same Nature equally renders him
sollicitous about the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ue and Event of
his Actions: For every one, by reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Way, and Method of his
own Workings, will find that he is still
determined in them by a respect to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107166:9"/>
Consequence of what he does; always
proceeding upon this Argumentation;
<hi>If I do such a thing, such an Advantage
will follow from it, and therefore I will do
it. And if I do this, such a Mischief will
ensue thereupon, and therefore I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear.</hi>
Every one, I say, is Concluded
by this Practical discourse; and for a
man to bring his Actions to the Event
proposed, and designed by him, is <hi>to
walk surely.</hi> But since the Event of an
Action usually follows the Nature or
Quality of it, and the Quality follows
the Rule directing it, it concerns a Man,
by all means, in the framing of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
not to be deceived in the Rule
which He proposes for the measure of
them; which, without great and exact
Caution, he may be these Two ways.</p>
            <p>1. By laying false and deceitfull Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>2. In case he lays right Principles, yet
by mistaking in the Consequences which
he draws from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107166:9"/>
An Error in either of which, is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dangerous; for if a Man is to draw
a Line, it is all one whether he does it
by a crooked Rule, or by a straight One
misapplied. He who fixes upon false
Principles, treads upon Infirm ground,
and so sinks; and He who fails in his
Deductions from right Principles, stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
upon Firm ground, and so falls;
the disaster is not of the same Kind, but
of the same Mischief in both.</p>
            <p>It must be confessed, that it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
very hard to judge of the Truth
or Goodness of Principles, considered
barely in themselves, and abstracted
from their Consequences. But certainly
he acts upon the surest and most Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
grounds in the World, who,
whether the Principles which he acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
prove true or false, yet secures an
happy Issue to his Actions.</p>
            <p>Now, He who guides his Actions by
the Rules of Piety and Religion, lays
these Two Principles as the great Ground
of all that He does.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107166:10"/>
1. That there is an Infinite, Eternal,
All-wise Mind governing the Affairs of
the World, and taking such an Account
of the Actions of men, as, according to
the Quality of them, to punish or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> That there is an Estate of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
or Misery after this Life, allotted
to Every man, according to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his Actions here. These, I say,
are the Principles which every Religious
man proposes to Himself; And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
which He makes from them, is
This: That it is his Grand Interest, and
Concern, so to act and behave Himself
in This World, as to secure Himself
from an Estate of Misery in the Other.
And thus to act, is, in the Phrase of
Scripture, <hi>to walk uprightly;</hi> and it is my
business to prove, That He who acts
in the strength of this Conclusion, drawn
from the Two fore-mentioned Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>walks surely,</hi> or secures an happy
Event to his Actions, against all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies
whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:107166:10"/>
And to demonstrate this, I shall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the said Principles under a Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Supposition,
<list>
                  <item>1. As Certainly True;</item>
                  <item>2<hi>ly.</hi> As Probable; And,</item>
                  <item>3<hi>ly.</hi> As False.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And if the Pious man brings his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to an happy End, which soever of
these Suppositions his Principles fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then certainly, there is none who
<hi>walks so surely,</hi> and upon such Irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grounds of Prudence, as He who is
Religious.</p>
            <p>1. First of all therefore we will take
these Principles (as we may very well
doe) under the Hypothesis of <hi>Certainly
true:</hi> Where, though the method of the
Ratiocination which I have cast the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
discourse into, does not naturally
engage me to <hi>prove them so,</hi> but onely
to shew what directly and necessarily
follows upon a supposal <hi>that they are so;</hi>
yet to give the greater Perspicuity and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107166:11"/>
Clearness to the Prosecution of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in hand, I shall briefly demonstrate
them thus.</p>
            <p>It is necessary, That there should be
some First Mover; and, if so, a first
Being; And the First Being must inferr
an Infinite, unlimited Perfection in the
said Being: For as much as if it were
Finite or Limited, that Limitation must
have been either from it self, or from
something else. But not from it self,
since it is contrary to Reason and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that any Being should Limit its
own Perfection; nor yet from some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, since then it should not have
been <hi>the First,</hi> as supposing some Other
Thing Coevous to it; which is against
the present Supposition. So that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clear, That there must be a <hi>First Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and that infinitely Perfect, it will
follow, that all other Perfection that is,
must be derived from it; and so we
inferr the Creation of the World: And
then supposing the World created by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107166:11"/>
God, (since it is no ways reconcileable
to God's Wisdom, that He should not
also govern it) Creation must need in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
Providence: And then, it being
granted, that God governs the World;
it will follow also, that He does it by
means suteable to the Natures of the
Things He Governs, and to the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the proper Ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And moreover, Man being by
Nature a free, moral Agent, and so, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of deviating from his Duty, as
well as performing it, it is necessary that
He should be governed by Laws: And
since Laws require that they be enforced
with the Sanction of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
sufficient to sway and work
upon the Minds of such as are to be
governed by them, and lastly, since
Experience shews that Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
terminated only within this
Life, are not sufficient for that Purpose,
it fairly and rationally follows, That the
Rewards and Punishments, which God
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107166:12"/>
governs Mankind by, do, and must,
look beyond it.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given a brief Proof
of the Certainty of these Principles;
namely, <hi>That there is a supreme Governour
of the World;</hi> and <hi>that there is a future
estate of happiness or misery for Men after
this Life:</hi> Which Principles, while a
man steers his Course by, if He acts pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
soberly, and temperately, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
there needs no further Arguments
to Evince, that He acts prudentially and
safely. For he acts as under the eye of
his just and severe Judge, who reaches
to his Creature a Command with One
Hand, and a Reward with the Other.
He spends as a Person, who knows that
He must come to a Reckoning. He sees
an Eternal Happiness or Misery, suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon a few days behaviour; and
therefore He lives every hour as for
Eternity. His future condition has such
a powerfull Influence upon his present
Practice, because he entertains a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107166:12"/>
Apprehension, and a firm Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it. If a man walks over a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Bridge, when he is drunk, it is
no wonder that he forgets his Caution,
while he over-looks his Danger. But
He who is sober, and views that nice
Separation between Himself and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
Deep, so that if he should slip,
he sees his Grave gaping under Him,
surely must needs take every step with
Horror, and the utmost Caution and
Sollicitude.</p>
            <p>But, for a man to believe it as the
most undoubted Certainty in the World,
that He shall be judged according to
the Quality of his Actions here, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Judgment receive an Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
and yet to take his full swing
in all the Pleasures of Sin, is it not a
greater Phrenzy, than, for a man to take
a Purse at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> while he is actually
seeing another Hanged for the same
Fact? It is really to dare and defy the
Justice of Heaven, to laugh at <hi>right-aiming
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107166:13"/>
Thunder-bolts,</hi> to puff at Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and, in a word, to bid Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<hi>do its worst.</hi> He indeed, who thus
walks, <hi>walks surely;</hi> but it is, because he
is <hi>sure</hi> to be damned.</p>
            <p>I confess it is hard to reconcile such
a stupid Course to the natural way of
the Soul's acting; according to which,
the Will moves according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals
of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> made by the
Understanding: And therefore for a man
to run head-long into the Bottomless Pit,
while the Eye of a Seeing Conscience
assures him, that it is Bottomless and
Open, and all Return from it Desperate
and Impossible; while His Ruin stares
him in the Face, and the Sword of Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
points directly at his Heart, still to
press on to the Embraces of His Sin, is
a Problem unresolvable upon any other
Ground, but that Sin infatuates before
it destroys. For <hi>Iudas,</hi> to receive and
swallow the Sop, when His Master gave
it him seasoned with those terrible words,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107166:13"/>
               <hi>It had been good for that man that He had
never been born.</hi> Surely this Argued a
furious Appetite, and a strong Stomach,
that could thus catch at a Morsel, with
the Fire and Brimstone all flaming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, and (as it were) digest Death
it self, and make a meal upon Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I could wish that every bold Sinner,
when he is about to engage in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of any known Sin, would arrest
his Confidence, and for a while stop
the Execution of his Purpose, with this
short Question; <hi>Doe I believe that it is
really true, that God has denounced Death
to such a Practice, or doe I not?</hi> If he does
not; let him renounce his Christianity,
and surrender back his Baptism, the
Water of which might better serve Him
to cool his Tongue in Hell, than onely
to Consign Him over to the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of so black an Apostacy. But if
he does believe it, how will he acquit
Himself upon the Accounts of bare Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107166:14"/>
For, does he think, that if he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
the means of Death, they will not
bring Him to that Fatal End? Or does
He think that He can grapple with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Vengeance, and endure the <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Burnings,</hi> or arm himself against
the Bites of the Never-dying Worm?
No surely, these are things not to be
Imagined; and therefore I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what security the presuming Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
can promise Himself, but upon these
Two following Accounts.</p>
            <p>1. That God is mercifull, and will
not be so severe as <hi>his word;</hi> and that
<hi>his Threatnings of Eternal Torments are
not so Decretory and Absolute, but that
there is a very Comfortable</hi> latitude <hi>left in
them for</hi> Men of Skill <hi>to creep out at.</hi>
And, here it must indeed be confessed,
that <hi>Origen,</hi> and some others, not long
since, who have been so officious as to
furbish up, and re-print his old Errors,
hold, That the Sufferings of the Damned
are not to be, in a strict sense, <hi>Eternal;</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:107166:14"/>
but that, after a Certain Revolution, and
Period of Time, there shall <hi>be a General
Gaol-delivery of the Souls in Prison,</hi> and that
not for a <hi>farther Execution,</hi> but a <hi>final Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease.</hi>
And it must be further acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that some of the Ancients, like
kind-hearted Men, have talked much of
Annual <hi>Refrigeriums,</hi> Respites, or Intervals
of Punishment to the Damned, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
on the Great Festivals of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
Ascension, Pentecost,</hi> and the like.
In which, as these good Men are more
to be commended for their Kindness and
Compassion, than to be followed in their
Opinion; (which may be much better
Argued by <hi>Wishes</hi> than <hi>Demonstrations;</hi>)
so, admitting that it were true, yet what
a pitifull, slender Comfort would this
amount to? Much like the <hi>Iews</hi> abating
the Punishment of Malefactors from <hi>forty
stripes,</hi> to <hi>forty save one.</hi> A great Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
indeded, even as great as the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Forty</hi> and <hi>Thirty-nine;</hi> and
yet much less considerable would that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107166:15"/>
Indulgence be, of a few Holy-days in
the measures of Eternity, of some Hours
Ease, compared with Infinite Ages of
Torment.</p>
            <p>Supposing therefore, that few Sinners
relieve themselves with such groundless,
trifling Considerations as these, yet may
they not however fasten a Rational Hope
upon the Boundless Mercy of God, that
this may induce him to spare his poor
Creature, though by Sin become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to His Wrath? To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That the Divine Mercy is indeed
large, and far surpassing all Created
measures, yet nevertheless it has its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
time; and after this Life it is the
time of Justice; and to hope for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of Mercy then, is to expect an
Harvest in the Dead of Winter. God
has cast all his Works into a certain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
Order; according to which,
there is a Time to Pardon, and a Time
to Punish; and the Time of One, is not
the Time of the Other. When Corn
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107166:15"/>
once felt the Sickle, it has no more Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
from the Sun-shine. But,</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> If the Conscience be too appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
(as for the most part it is) to
venture the Final issue of Things, upon a
Fond perswasion, that the Great Judge
of the World will relent, and not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Sentence pronounced by him;
<hi>As if he had threatned Men with Hell, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to fright them from Sin, than with an
Intent to punish them for it;</hi> I say, if the
Conscience cannot find any Satisfaction
or Support from such Reasonings as
these, yet may it not, at least, relieve
it self with the Purposes of a future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
notwithstanding its present,
actual Violations of the Law? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That this certainly is a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of all others, the most ungrounded
and irrational. For upon what Ground
can a man promise Himself a Future
Repentance, who cannot promise Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Futurity? Whose Life depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
His Breath, and is so restrained to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107166:16"/>
the present, that it cannot secure to it
self the Reversion of the very next Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute.
Have not many died with the
guilt of Impenitence, and the designs
of Repentance together? If a man dies
to day, by the prevalence of some ill
humours, will it avail Him that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have bled and purged to
morrow?</p>
            <p>But how dares sinfull Dust and Ashes
invade the Prerogative of Providence,
and Carve out to Himself the Seasons
and Issues of Life and Death, which
the <hi>Father</hi> keeps wholly <hi>within his own
Power?</hi> How does that man, who thinks
he sins securely, under the shelter of
some Remote purposes of Amendment,
know, but that the Decree above may
be already passed against Him, and his
Allowance of Mercy spent; so that the
<hi>Bow in the Clouds</hi> is now drawn, and the
Arrow levelled at his Head; and not
many Days like to pass, but perhaps an
Apoplex, or an Impostome, or some sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107166:16"/>
Disaster may stop his Breath, and
reap him down as a Sinner ripe for
Destruction?</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore, That, upon Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the <hi>Certain Truth</hi> of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Religion; He, who <hi>walks not
uprightly,</hi> has neither from the Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>God's Mercy Reversing the Decree
of his Iustice,</hi> nor from his own <hi>Purposes
of a Future Repentance,</hi> any sure ground
to set his Foot upon; but in this whole
Course Acts as directly in Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Nature, as he does in defiance of
Grace. In a word, He is besotted, and
has lost his Reason; and what then can
there be for Religion to take hold of
Him by? Come we now to the</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> Supposition; under which, we
shew, That the Principles of Religion,
laid down by us, might be Considered;
and that is, as <hi>onely Probable.</hi> Where we
must observe, That <hi>Probability</hi> does not
properly make any Alteration, either in
the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falsity</hi> of Things; but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107166:17"/>
onely Imports a different Degree of
their Clearness, or Appearance to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
So that that is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Probable,</hi> which has more and better
Arguments producible for it, than can
be brought against it; and surely such
a thing, at least, is Religion. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that Religion is Universal, I
mean <hi>the first Rudiments and General No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Religion, called Natural Religion,
and consisting in the acknowledgment of a
Deity, and of the common Principles of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
and a future Estate of Souls after
Death,</hi> (in which also we have all that
some <hi>Reformers</hi> and <hi>Refiners</hi> amongst
us, would reduce Christianity it self to.)
This Notion of Religion, I say, has dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
it self in some degree or other,
greater or less, as far as human Nature
extends. So that there is no Nation in
the World, though plunged into never
such gross and absurd Idolatry; but has
some awfull Sence of a Deity, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of a State of Retribution to Men
after this Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:107166:17"/>
But now, if there are really no such
Things, but all is a meer Lye, and a
Fable, contrived only to chain up the
Liberty of Man's Nature from a freer
Enjoyment of those things, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it would have as full a right to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
as to Breath, I demand whence this
perswasion could thus come to be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal?
For was it ever known, in any
other Instance, that the whole World
was brought to Conspire in the belief
of a Lye? Nay, and of such a Lye,
as should lay upon Men such unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Abridgments, tying them up from
a full Gratification of those Lusts and
Appetites, which they so impatiently
desire to satisfie, and consequently, by
all means, to remove those Impediments
that might any way obstruct their satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction?
Since therefore it cannot be
made out, upon any Principle of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
how all the Nations in the World,
otherwise so distant in Situation, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Interests, and Inclinations, should
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107166:18"/>
by Design or Combination, meet in
one perswasion; and withall, that Men,
who so mortally hate to be deceived,
and imposed upon, should yet suffer
themselves to be deceived by such a
perswasion as is false; and not onely
false, but also cross, and contrary to
their strongest Desires; so that if it were
false, they would set the utmost force
of their Reason on work to discover
that Falsity, and thereby disenthrall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
And further, since there is nothing
false, but what may be proved to be so:
And yet, Lastly, since all the Power
and Industry of Man's mind has not
been hitherto able to prove a Falsity in
the Principles of Religion, it Irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
follows (and that, I suppose, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
gathering any more into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
than has been made good in
the Premises) that Religion is, at least,
a very high <hi>Probability.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is that which I here contend
for, That it is not necessary to the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107166:18"/>
Men to believe Religion to be true,
that this Truth be made out to their
Reason, by Arguments demonstratively
certain; but that it is sufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Unbelief unexcusable, even
upon the account of bare Reason, if
so be the Truth of Religion carry in it
a much greater Probability, than any
of those Ratiocinations that pretend the
Contrary: And this I prove in the
strength of these two Considerations.</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> That no man, in matters of this
Life, requires an Assurance either of the
Good, which He designs, or of the Evil,
which He avoids, from Arguments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively
certain; but judges Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to have sufficient ground to act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from a probable perswasion of the
Event of things. No man who first
Trafficks into a Foreign Countrey, has
any Scientifick Evidence, that there is
such a Countrey, but by Report, which
can produce no more than a moral
Certainty; that is, a very high <hi>probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:107166:19"/>
and such as there can be no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to except against. He who has a
probable Belief, that He shall meet with
Thieves in such a Road, thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to have Reason enough to decline
it, albeit he is sure to sustain some less
(though yet considerable) Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by his so doing. But perhaps it
may be replied, (and it is all that can
be replied) That a greater <hi>Assurance</hi> and
<hi>Evidence</hi> is required of the Things and
Concerns of the other World, than of
the Interests of this. To which I Answer,
That <hi>Assurance</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> (Terms, by
the way, Extremely different; the first,
respecting properly the <hi>Ground</hi> of our
Assenting to a Thing; and the other,
the <hi>Clearness</hi> of the Thing, or <hi>Object</hi>
assented to) have no place at all here,
as being contrary to our present <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;</hi>
according to which, we are
now treating of the Practical Principles
of Religion onely as <hi>Probable,</hi> and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
under a <hi>Probable Perswasion.</hi> And
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107166:19"/>
for this, I affirm, That where the Case
is about the Hazarding an Eternal, or
a Temporal Concern, there a less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Probability ought to engage our
Caution against the loss of the Former,
than is necessary to engage it about pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the loss of the Latter. Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
as where Things are least to be
put to the venture, as the Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of the other World ought to be;
there every, even the least, Probability,
or likelihood of Danger, should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
against; but where the loss can
be but Temporal, every small Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of it, need not put us so Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to prevent it, since, though it should
happen, the loss might be repaired again;
or, if not, could not however destroy
us, by reaching us in our greatest and
highest Concern; which no Temporal
Thing whatsoever is, or can be. And
this directly introduces the</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> Consideration or Argument, <hi>viz.</hi>
That bare Reason, discoursing upon a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107166:20"/>
Principle of Self-preservation (which sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is the Fundamental Principle which
Nature proceeds by) will oblige a man
Voluntarily, and by Choice, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
any less Evil to secure Himself but
from the Probability of an Evil incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
greater, and that also, such an
one, as, if that Probability passes into a
certain Event, admits of no Reparation
by any After-remedy that can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to it.</p>
            <p>Now, that Religion teaching a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Estate of Souls, is a Probability;
and that its Contrary cannot with Equal
Probability be proved, we have already
Evinced. This therefore being suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
we will suppose yet further, That
for a man to Abridge Himself in the full
satisfaction of His Appetites, and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
is <hi>an Evil,</hi> because a present
Pain and Trouble: But then it must
likewise be granted, that Nature must
needs abhorr a State of Eternal Pain and
Misery much more; and that if a man
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107166:20"/>
does not undergo the former less Evil,
it is highly probable that such an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
estate of Misery will be his Portion;
And if so, I would fain know whether that
man takes a Rational Course to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Himself, who Refuses the Endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of these Lesser Troubles, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Himself from a Condition infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and inconceivably more Miserable.</p>
            <p>But since Probability, in the Nature
of it, supposes that a Thing <hi>may,</hi> or <hi>may
not</hi> be so, for any thing that yet appears,
or is certainly determined on either side,
we will here consider both sides of this
Probability: As,</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> That, it is one way possible, That
there may be no such Thing as a future
estate of happiness, or misery, for those
who have lived well or ill here; And then
he, who upon the strength of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
belief, abridged himself in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of his Appetites, sustains only
this Evil; <hi>viz.</hi> That he did not please
his Senses, and unbounded Desires, so
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107166:21"/>
much as otherwise he might, and would
have done, had he not lived under the
Captivity and Check of such a Belief.
This is the Utmost which he suffers: But
whether this be a Real Evil or no (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Vulgar minds may commonly
think it) shall be discoursed of afterwards.</p>
            <p>2. But then again, on the other side,
'tis <hi>Probable</hi> that there will be such a
future estate; and then, how misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
is the voluptuous, sensual Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
left in the Lurch? For there can
be no Retreat for him then, no mending
of his Choice in the other World, no
After-game to be played in Hell. It
fares with Men, in reference to their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Estate, and the Condition upon
which they must pass to it, much as it
does with a Merchant, having a Vessel
richly fraught at Sea in a Storm: the
Storm grows higher and higher, and
threatens the utter loss of the Ship: But
there is one, and but one Certain way
to save it, which is, by throwing its Rich
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107166:21"/>
Lading over-board; Yet still, for all
this, the man knows not but <hi>possibly</hi> the
Storm may cease, and so all be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
However, in the mean time, there
is little or no Probability that it will doe
<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> in case it should not, he is then
<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that he must lay his Life, as well
a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his Rich Commodities in the Cruel
Deep. Now, in this Case, would this
man, think we, act rationally, should
he, upon the slender <hi>Possibility</hi> of Esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
otherwise, neglect the sure, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Preservation of his Life, by casting
away his Rich Goods? No certainly,
it would be so far from it, that should
the Storm, by a strange hap, cease im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after he had thus thrown away
his Riches; yet the Throwing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
was infinitely more Rational and
Eligible, than the Retaining or Keeping
them could have been.</p>
            <p>For a man, while He lives here in
the World, to doubt whether there be
any Hell or no; and thereupon to Live
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107166:22"/>
so, as if absolutely there were none;
but when he dies, to find himself Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
in the Flames, This, surely, must
be the height of Woe and Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a bitter Conviction of an
irrational Venture, and an absurd Choice.
In doubtfull Cases, Reason still deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
for the safer side; Especially if
the Case be not onely Doubtfull, but
also highly Concerning, and the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be of a Soul, and an Eternity.</p>
            <p>He who sat at a Table, richly and
deliciously furnished, but with a Sword
hanging over his Head by one single
Thread or Hair, surely had enough to
check his Appetite, even against all the
Ragings of Hunger, and Temptations
of Sensuality. The onely Argument
that could any way encourage his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
was, That <hi>possibly the Sword might
not fall,</hi> but when his Reason should
encounter it with another Question, <hi>What
if it should fall?</hi> And moreover, that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Stay by which it hung, should op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107166:22"/>
the <hi>likelihood that it would,</hi> to a meer
<hi>possibility that it might not;</hi> what could
the man enjoy or tast of his rich Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
with all this doubt and horror
working in his Mind?</p>
            <p>Though a Man's condition should
be really in it self never <hi>so safe,</hi> yet an
apprehension and surmise that it is <hi>not
safe,</hi> is enough to make a quick and a
tender Reason sufficiently miserable. Let
the most Acute, and Learned Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
demonstrate that there is no Hell:
And if he can, he Sins so much the
more rationally; otherwise, if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
the Case remains doubtfull at least:
But he who Sins obstinately, does not
act as if it were so much as doubtfull;
for if it were Certain and Evident to
Sense, he could do no more; but for
a man to found a confident Practice
upon a disputable Principle, is brutish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to out-run his Reason, and to build
ten times wider than his Foundation.
In a word, I look upon this one short
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107166:23"/>
Consideration (were there no more)
as a sufficient Ground for any Rational
Man to take up his Religion upon, and
which I defy the subtlest Atheist in the
World solidly to answer, or confute;
Namely, <hi>That it is good to be sure.</hi> And
so I proceed to the</p>
            <p>Third and Last Supposition; Under
which, the Principles of Religion may
(for Argument sake) be considered; and
that is, <hi>as False;</hi> which surely must reach
the utmost Thoughts of any Atheist what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
Nevertheless, even upon this
account also, I doubt not but to Evince,
That he who <hi>walks uprightly, walks</hi> much
more <hi>surely,</hi> than the wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Liver; and that with reference to
the most Valued Temporal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
such as are, <hi>Reputation, Quietness,
Health,</hi> and the like, which are the
greatest which this Life affords, or is
desireable for. And,</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> For <hi>Reputation</hi> or <hi>Credit.</hi> Is any
one had in greater Esteem than the Just
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107166:23"/>
Person; who has given the World an
Assurance, by the constant tenour of his
Practice, That he makes a Conscience of
his ways; That he scorns to doe an
unworthy, or a base Thing; to lye,
to defraud, to undermine another's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
by any sinister and inferiour Arts?
And is there any thing, which reflects a
greater Lustre upon a Man's Person, than
a severe Temperance, and a Restraint
of Himself, from vitious and unlawfull
Pleasures? Does any thing shine so
bright as Vertue, and that even in the
Eyes of those who are void of it? For
hardly shall you find any one so bad,
but he desires the Credit of <hi>being Thought,</hi>
what his Vice will not let <hi>him be;</hi> so
great a Pleasure, and Convenience is
it, to live with Honour, and a fair Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
amongst those whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with; And a Being without it, is
not <hi>Life,</hi> but rather the <hi>Skeleton</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put
mortuum</hi> of <hi>Life;</hi> like Time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Day, or Day it self without the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107166:24"/>
shining of the Sun to enliven it.</p>
            <p>On the other side, Is there any thing
that more embitters all the Enjoyments
of this Life, than Shame and Reproach?
Yet this is generally the Lot and Portion
of the Impious and Irreligious; and
of some of them more especially.</p>
            <p>For how Infamous, in the first place,
is the false, fraudulent and unconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Person? and how quickly is his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
known? For hardly ever did any
man of <hi>no Conscience</hi> continue a man of
<hi>any Credit</hi> long. Likewise, how <hi>Odious,</hi> as
well as Infamous, is such an One? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
if he be arrived at that Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and Robust degree of Falshood,
as to play in and out, and shew Tricks
with <hi>Oaths,</hi> the sacredest Bonds which
the Conscience of Man can be bound
with; how is such an One shunn'd and
dreaded, like a walking Pest? What
Volleys of Scoffs, Curses, and Satyrs,
are discharged at Him? So that let ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much Honour be placed upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107166:24"/>
Him, it cleaves not to Him, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ceases to be <hi>Honour,</hi> by being so
<hi>placed;</hi> No Preferment can sweeten
Him, but the higher he stands, the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and wider he stinks.</p>
            <p>In like manner, for the <hi>Drinker,</hi> and
<hi>debauched</hi> Person: Is any thing more
the object of Scorn and Contempt, than
such an One? His Company is justly
look'd upon as a disgrace; and no Body
can own a Friendship for him, without
being an Enemy to himself. A Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
is (as it were) Out-law'd from all
worthy and creditable Converse. Men
abhorr, loath, and despise him, and would
even spit at him as they meet him, were
it not for fear that a stomach so charged,
should <hi>something more</hi> than spit at them.</p>
            <p>But not to go over all the several
Kinds of Vice and Wickedness, should
we set aside the Consideration of the
<hi>Glories</hi> of a better World, and allow
this Life for the Onely Place and Scene
of Man's happiness; yet surely <hi>Cato</hi> will
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107166:25"/>
be always more Honourable than <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
and <hi>Cicero</hi> than <hi>Catiline.</hi> Fidelity,
Justice, and Temperance, will always
draw their own Reward after them, or
rather carry it with them, in those marks
of Honour which they fix upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who practise and pursue them. It
is said of <hi>David,</hi> in 1 <hi>Chron. 29. 28.
That he died full of Days, Riches, and
Honour;</hi> and there was no need of an
Heaven, to render him in all respects a
much <hi>happier</hi> man than <hi>Saul.</hi> But in the</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> Place, The Vertuous and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Person walks upon <hi>surer Grounds,</hi>
than the Vicious and Irreligious, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the <hi>Ease, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Quietness,</hi>
which he enjoys in this World; and
which certainly make no small part of
Human felicity. For Anxiety and Labour
are great Ingredients of that Curse, which
Sin has intail'd upon Fal'n man. Care
and Toil came into the World with Sin,
and remain ever since inseparable from
it, both as to its Punishment, and Effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:107166:25"/>
The <hi>service</hi> of Sin is <hi>perfect slavery;</hi>
and he who will pay Obedience to the
Commands of it, shall find it an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
Task-master, and an Unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable
Exactor.</p>
            <p>And to represent the Case in some
Particulars. The Ambitious Person must
rise early, and sit up late, and pursue
his Design with a constant, indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Attendance; he must be infinitely
patient and servile, and obnoxious to
all the cross Humours of those whom
he expects to rise by; he must endure
and digest all sorts of Affronts; Adore
the Foot that Kicks him, and Kiss the
Hand that strikes him: While, in the
mean time, the Humble and Contented
Man is vertuous at a much easier rate:
His Vertue bids him sleep, and take his
rest, while the others restless Sin bids
him sit up and watch. He pleases him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
innocently and easily, while the
Ambitious man attempts to please o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sinfully, and difficultly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107166:26"/>
in the Issue, unsuccessfully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to.</p>
            <p>The Robber, and Man of Rapine,
must run, and ride, and use all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and even desperate Ways of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape;
and probably, after all, his Sin
betrays him to a Gaol, and from thence
advances him to the Gibbet: But let
him carry off his Booty with as much
safety and success as he can wish, yet
the Innocent Person, with never so little
of his own, envies him not, and, if he
has nothing, fears him not.</p>
            <p>Likewise the cheat, and fradulent
Person, is put to a Thousand shifts to
palliate his Fraud, and to be thought
an honest Man: But surely there can
be no greater Labour, than to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
dissembling, and forced to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a constant disguise, there being so
many ways by which a smothered Truth
is apt to blaze, and break out; the
very Nature of Things, making it not
more Natural for them <hi>to be,</hi> than to
appear <hi>as they be.</hi> But he, who will be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107166:26"/>
really honest, just, and sincere in his
Dealings, needs take no pains to be
thought so; no more than the Sun needs
take any pains to shine, or, when he is
up, to convince the World that it is
Day.</p>
            <p>And here again, to bring in the Man
of Luxury and Intemperance for his
share in the Pain and Trouble, as well
as in the fore-mentioned Shame and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
of his Vice. Can any Toil, or
Day-labour, equal the Fatigue, or Drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
which such an one undergoes, while
he is continually pouring in Draught af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Draught, and cramming in Morsel
after Morsel, and that in spight of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
and Nature, till he
becomes a Burthen to the
very Earth that bears him;<note place="margin">See the First Vol. p. 29, and 30.</note>
though not so great an One to That,
but that (if possible) he is yet a greater
to Himself?</p>
            <p>And now, in the last place, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
one Sinner more, and him a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107166:27"/>
leading Sinner indeed, to wit, the
<hi>Rebel.</hi> Can any thing have more of
Trouble, Hazard, and Anxiety in it,
than the Course which he takes? For,
in the first place, all the Evils of War
must unavoidably be endured, as the
necessary Means and Instruments to
compass, and give success to his Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
designs. In which, if it is his
Lot to be Conquered, he must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that Vengeance that justly attends
a conquered, disarmed Villain; for when
such an one is vanquished, <hi>his Sins are
always upon him.</hi> But if, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he proves Victorious, he will yet
find Misery enough in the distracting
Cares of settling an ungrounded, odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
detestable Interest, so heartily, and
so justly maligned, abhorred, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
plotted against; So that, in effect,
he is still in <hi>War,</hi> though he has quitted
the <hi>Field.</hi> The Torment of his suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
is great, and the Courses he must
take to quiet his jealous, suspicious Mind,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107166:27"/>
infinitely troublesome and vexatious.</p>
            <p>But, in the mean time, the Labour
of Obedience, Loyalty, and Subjection,
is no more, but for a man honestly and
discreetly to sit still, and to enjoy what
he has, under the Protection of the Laws.
And when such an one is in his lowest
condition, he is yet high and happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to despise and pity the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
<hi>Rebel</hi> in the World: Even those
famous Ones of <hi>Forty-one</hi> (with all due
Respect to their flourishing Relations be
it spoke) not excepted. In the</p>
            <p>Third and Last place, The Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Person <hi>walks upon surer</hi> grounds than
the Irreligious, in respect of the very
<hi>Health of his Body.</hi> Vertue is a Friend,
and an Help to Nature, but it is Vice
and Luxury that destroys it, and the
Diseases of Intemperance are the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
product of the Sins of Intemperance.
Whereas, on the other side, a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
innocent use of the Creature, never
casts any one into a Fever, or a Surfeit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:107166:28"/>
Chastity makes no work for a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
nor ever ends in <hi>rottenness of Bones.</hi>
Sin is the fruitfull Parent of Distempers,
and <hi>Ill Lives</hi> occasion <hi>Good Physicians.</hi>
Seldom shall one see in Cities, Courts,
and Rich Families (where Men live plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
and eat and drink freely) that
perfect Health, that Athletick sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and vigour of Constitution, which
is commonly seen in the Countrey, in
poor Houses, and Cottages, where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is their cook, and Necessity their
Caterer, and where they have no other
Doctor, but the Sun and the fresh Air,
and that such an One, as never sends
them to the Apothecary. It has been
observed in the earlier Ages of the
Church, that none lived such healthfull,
and long Lives, as Monks and Hermits,
who had sequestred themselves from the
Pleasures and Plenties of the World, to
a constant Ascetick Course, of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
Abstinence and Devotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:107166:28"/>
Nor is Excess the onely Thing by
which Sin mauls and breaks Men in
their Health, and the comfortable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of themselves thereby, but
many are also brought to a very ill and
languishing Habit of Body, by meer
Idleness; and Idleness is both it self a
great Sin, and the Cause of many more.
The Husbandman returns from the
Field, and from Manuring his Ground
strong and healthy, because innocent and
laborious; You will find <hi>no Diet-drinks,</hi>
no <hi>Boxes of Pills,</hi> nor <hi>Galley-pots,</hi> amongst
his Provisions; no, he neither <hi>speaks</hi> nor
<hi>lives</hi> French, he is not <hi>so much a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
(forsooth.) His Meals are course
and short, his Employment warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
his Sleep certain and refreshing,
neither interrupted with the Lashes of a
guilty Mind, nor the Aches of a crazy
Body. And when Old Age comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, it comes alone, bringing no
other Evil with it but it self: But when
it comes to wait upon a great and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107166:29"/>
Sinner (who for many years
together has had the Reputation of <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well,</hi> and <hi>Doing ill</hi>) it comes (as it
ought to doe, to a Person of such Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity)
attended with a long Train and
Retinue of Rheums, Coughs, Catarrhs,
and Dropsies, together with many pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Girds and Achings, which are at least
called <hi>the Gout.</hi> How does such an one
go about, or is carried rather, with his
Body bending inward, his Head sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and his Eyes always watering (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>weeping</hi>) for the Sins of his Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spent
Youth. In a word, Old Age Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
upon such a Person, like Fire upon a
rotten House; it was rotten before, and
must have fal'n of it self; so that it is
no more but one Ruin preventing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewn the Fruits and
Effects of Sin upon Men in this World.
But peradventure it will be replied, That
there are many Sinners who escape all
these Calamities, and neither labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107166:29"/>
any shame or disrepute, any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietness
of Condition, or more than
ordinary distemper of Body, but pass
their Days with as great a Portion of
Honour, Ease, and Health, as any other
Men whatsoever. But to this I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That those Sinners who are in
such a temporally happy Condition,
owe it not to their Sins, but wholly to
their Luck, and a benign Chance that
they are so. Providence often disposes
of Things by a Method beside, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the discourses of Man's Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Number of those
Sinners, who by their Sins have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
plunged into all the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Evils, is incomparably greater than
the Number of those, who, by the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
favour of Providence, have escaped
them. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> That, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this, Sin has yet in it self a
natural Tendency to bring Men under
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107166:30"/>
all these Evils; and, if persisted in, will
infallibly end in them, unless hindred by
some unusual Accident or other, which
no man, acting Rationally, can steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
build upon. It is not impossible,
but a man may practice a Sin secretly,
to his Dying-day; but it is Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
to One, if the Practice be constant,
but that some time or other it will be
discovered; and then the Effect of Sin
discovered, must be Shame and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Sinner. It is possible also,
that a man may be an old Healthfull
Epicure; but I affirm also, that it is
next to a Miracle, if he be so; and the
like is to be said of the several Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Sin, hitherto produced by us. In
short, nothing can step between them
and Misery in this World, but a very
great, strange, and unusual Chance,
which none will presume of, who <hi>walks
surely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so, I suppose, That Religion
cannot possibly be enforced (even in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107166:30"/>
the judgment of its best Friends, and
most professed Enemies) by any further
Arguments, than what have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
(how much better soever the
said Arguments may be managed by
abler hands.) For I have shewn and
proved, That whether the Principles of
it be <hi>Certain,</hi> or but <hi>Probable,</hi> nay,
though supposed absolutely <hi>False;</hi> yet
a man is sure of that happiness in the
<hi>Practice,</hi> which he cannot be in the
<hi>Neglect</hi> of it; And consequently, that
though he were really a <hi>Speculative Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist,</hi>
(which there is great reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that none perfectly are,) yet if
he would but proceed rationally, that
is, if (according to his own measures
of Reason) he would but <hi>Love himself,</hi>
he could not however be a <hi>Practical
Atheist;</hi> nor live <hi>without God in this World,</hi>
whether or no he expected to be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by him in <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, to make some Application
of the foregoing Discourse, we may, by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107166:31"/>
an easy, but sure Deduction, conclude
and gather from it these Two things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That that Profane, Atheistical,
Epicurean Rabble, whom the whole
Nation so rings of, and who have lived
so much to the defiance of God, the
dishonour of Mankind, and the disgrace
of the Age which they are cast upon,
are not indeed (what they are pleased
to think and vote themselves) the <hi>wisest
Men in the World;</hi> for in matters of
Choice, no man can be <hi>wise</hi> in any
Course or Practice, in which he is not
<hi>safe</hi> too. But can these high Assumers,
and Pretenders to Reason, prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so, amidst all those <hi>Liberties</hi> and
<hi>Latitudes</hi> of Practice which they take?
Can they make it out against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sence and Opinion of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that there is no such Thing as a
future estate of misery for such as have
lived ill here? Or, can they perswade
themselves that their own particular
Reason denying, or doubting of it,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107166:31"/>
ought to be relyed upon, as a surer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Truth, than the Universal,
united Reason of all the World besides
affirming it? Every Fool may believe,
and pronounce confidently; but wise
men will, in matters of <hi>Discourse,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
firmly, and, in matters of <hi>Practice,
act surely:</hi> And, if these will do so too
in the Case now before us, they must
prove it, not only <hi>probable</hi> (which yet
they can never doe,) but also <hi>certain,</hi>
and past all doubt, that there is no Hell,
nor place of Torment for the wicked;
or at least, that they themselves, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all their villainous and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
Practices, are not to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of that Number and Character; but,
that with a <hi>non obstante</hi> to all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
their <hi>Profaneness,</hi> and scandalous
Debaucheries of all sortes, they continue
<hi>virtuoso's</hi> still; and are that in Truth,
which the world in Favour and <hi>Fashion</hi>
(or rather by an <hi>Antiphrasis</hi>) is pleased
to call them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:107166:32"/>
In the mean time, it cannot but be
matter of just Indignation to all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and good men, to see a Company
of Lewd, Shallow-brain'd Huffs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Atheism and Contempt of Religion,
the sole Badge and Character of Wit,
Gallantry, and true Discretion; and then,
over their Pots, and Pipes, claiming and
engrossing all these wholly to themselves;
magisterially censuring the Wisdom of
all Antiquity, scoffing at all Piety, and
(as it were) new modelling the whole
World. When yet, such as have had
opportunity to sound these Braggers
throughly, by having sometimes endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Penance of their sottish Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
have found them in Converse so
Empty and Insipid; in Discourse so
Trifling and Contemptible, that it is
impossible but that they should give a
Credit and an Honour, to whatsoever
and whomsoever they speak against:
They are, indeed, such as seem wholly
incapable of entertaining any Design
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107166:32"/>
above the present gratification of their
Palates, and whose very Souls and
Thoughts rise no higher than their
Throats; but yet withall, of such a cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
and provoking Impiety, that
they are enough to make the Nation
like <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> in their Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they have already made it too
like them in their Sins. Certain it is, that
Blasphemy and Irreligion have grown
to that daring height here of late years,
that had men in any sober, civilized
Heathen Nation, spoke or done half so
much in Contempt of their false Gods
and Religion, as some in our Days and
Nation, wearing the name of Christians,
have spoke and done against God and
Christ, they would have been infallibly
burnt at a Stake, as monsters and publick
Enemies of society.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the Persons here reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon, are of such a peculiar stamp of
Impiety, that they seem to be a set of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
got together, and formed in to a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107166:33"/>
kind of <hi>Diabolical society,</hi> for the finding
out <hi>new experiments</hi> in Vice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they laugh at the dull, unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
obsolete Sinners of former Times;
and scorning to keep themselves within
the common, beaten, <hi>broad</hi> way to
<hi>Hell,</hi> by being vicious onely at the
low rate of <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Imitation,</hi>
they are for searching out other ways
and <hi>latitudes,</hi> and obliging Posterity
with unheard of Inventions and Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
in Sin; resolving herein to admit
of no other measure of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi>
but the Judgment of <hi>Sensuality,</hi> as those
who prepare matters to their hands, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
no other measure of the Philosophy
and Truth of things, but the sole <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sense.</hi> And these (forsooth)
are our great Sages, and those who must
pass for the only shrewd, thinking and
inquisitive men of the Age; and such as
by a long, severe, and profound Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Nature, have redeemed themselves
from the <hi>Pedantry</hi> of being Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107166:33"/>
and living vertuously, and from
such old fashion'd <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Creeds,</hi>
as tye up the minds of some <hi>narrow-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited,
Uncomprehensive</hi> Zealots, who <hi>know
not the world,</hi> nor understand, that he
onely is the truly <hi>wise man,</hi> who, <hi>per fas
&amp; nefas,</hi> gets as much as He can.</p>
            <p>But, for all this, let Atheists and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualists
satisfie themselves as they are able.
The former of which will find, that
as long as Reason keeps Her ground,
Religion neither can, nor will lose
Hers. And for the Sensual Epicure, he
also will find, That there is a certain
<hi>living spark</hi> within him, which all the
Drink he can pour in, will never be
able to <hi>quench</hi> or put out; nor will his
rotten abused Body, have it in it's power
to convey any putrefying, consuming,
rotting Quality to the Soul: No, there
is no <hi>Drinking,</hi> or <hi>Swearing,</hi> or <hi>Ranting,</hi>
or <hi>Fluxing</hi> a Soul out of its <hi>Immortality.</hi>
But that must and will survive and abide,
in spight of Death and the Grave; and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107166:34"/>
live for ever to convince such wretches
to their eternal Woe, That the so much
repeated ornament and flourish of their
former speeches; (<hi>God damn 'em</hi>) was
commonly the truest word they spoke,
though least believed by them, while
they spoke it.</p>
            <p>2dly, The other thing deducible
from the foregoing particulars, shall be
to inform us of the way of attaining to
that excellent Privilege, so justly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
by those who have it, and so much
talked of by those who have it not; which
is <hi>Assurance. Assurance</hi> is properly that
perswasion or Confidence, which a man
takes up of the pardon of his sins, and
his interest in God's favour, upon such
Grounds and Terms, as the Scripture
lays down. But now, since the Scripture
promises eternal Happiness and Pardon
of sin, upon the sole condition of Faith,
and sincere Obedience, it is evident,
that he onely can plead a Title to such
a Pardon, whose conscience impartially
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107166:34"/>
tells him, that he has performed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Condition. And this is the only
rational <hi>Assurance,</hi> which a man can
with any safety rely, or rest himself upon.</p>
            <p>He who in this Case would <hi>believe sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
must first <hi>walk surely;</hi> and to do so, is
to <hi>walk uprightly.</hi> And what that is, we
have sufficiently marked out to us, in
those plain and legible lines of Duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
us to Demean our selves to God,
humbly and devoutly; to our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
obediently; and to our Neighbours
justly; and to our selves soberly and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately.
All other Pretences being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
vain in themselves, and fatal in
their Consequences.</p>
            <p>It was indeed the way of many in
the late times, to bolster up their Crazy,
doating Consciences, with (I know not
what) odd Confidences, founded upon
inward <hi>whispers of the Spirit, stories of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which they called conversion, and marks
of Predestination:</hi> All of them (as they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107166:35"/>
them) mere delusions, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles,
and Fig leaves; and such as would
be sure to fall off and leave them naked,
before that fiery Tribunal, which knows
no other way of <hi>Iudging</hi> men, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their <hi>works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obedience and <hi>Upright Walking</hi> are
such Substantial, Vital parts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as, if they be wanting, can never
be made up, or commuted for by any
formalities of Phantastick looks, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
And the great Question when
we come hereafter to be judged, will not
be, <hi>How demurely have you looked?</hi> or,
<hi>How boldly have you believed? With what
length have you prayed?</hi> and, <hi>With what
loudness and vehemence have you preached?</hi>
But, <hi>How holily have you lived?</hi> and, <hi>How
uprightly have you walked?</hi> For this, and
this only, (with the Merits of Christ's
Righteousness) will come into Account,
before that great <hi>Iudge,</hi> who will pass
Sentence upon every man <hi>according to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107166:35"/>
what he has done here in the Flesh, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be good, or whether it be evil;</hi> and
<hi>there is no respect of Persons with Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whom therefore be rendred and ascribed,
as is most due, all Praise, Might, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and Dominion, both now and for
evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <q>Henceforth I call you not Servants; for

            </epigraph>
            <p>WE have here an Account of
Christ's friendship to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
that is, we have the best of things
represented, in the greatest of Examples.
In other men we see the Excellency, but
in Christ the Divinity of Friendship. By
our Baptism and Church-Communion,
we are made <hi>one Body</hi> with <hi>Christ;</hi> but
by This we become <hi>one soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Love is the greatest of Humane Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and Friendship is the Noblest
and most Refined Improvement of
Love; a quality of the largest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass.
And it is here admirable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107166:38"/>
the ascending gradation of the
Love, which Christ bore to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
The strange and superlative great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of which will appear from those
several degrees of kindness, that it has
manifested to man, in the several Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods
of His Condition. As,</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> If we consider him antecedently to
his Creation; while he yet lay in the
barren Womb of Nothing, and only
in the Number of Possibilities: and
consequently, could have nothing to
recommend him to Christ's affection,
nor shew any thing lovely, but what
he should afterwards receive from the
stamp of a preventing Love. Yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
then did the Love of Christ begin
to work, and to commence in the first
Emanations, and purposes of goodness
towards Man; designing to provide
matter for it self to work upon, to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
its own object, and like the Sun, in
the production of some Animals; first
to give a being, and then to shine upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:107166:38"/>
2dly, Let us take the Love of Christ
as directing it self to Man actually Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and brought into the World; and
so all those glorious Endowments of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, in its Original State and
Innocence, were so many Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the munificent goodness of Him,
<hi>by whom God first made,</hi> as well as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>redeemed the world.</hi> There was
a Consult of the whole Trinity, for
the making of Man, that so He might
shine as a Master-piece, not only of the
Art, but also of the kindness of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator;
with a noble, and a clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
a rightly disposed Will, and
a Train of Affections regular, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious,
and perfectly conformable to
the Dictates, of that high, and divine
Principle, <hi>Right Reason.</hi> So that, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole matter, he stept forth,
not only the work of God's hands, but
also the Copy of his perfections; a kind
of Image, or representation of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>small.</hi> Infinity contracted into
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107166:39"/>
flesh and blood; and (as I may so speak)
the Preludium, and first Essay towards
the Incarnation of the Divine Nature.
But,</p>
            <p>3dly and Lastly, Let us look upon
man, not only as created, and brought
into the World, with all these great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
superadded to his Being; but
also, as depraved, and faln from them;
as an Out-law, and a Rebel, and one
that could plead a Title to nothing,
but to the highest Severities of a Sin-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
Justice. Yet even in this estate
also, the Boundless Love of Christ began
to have warm thoughts, and actings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
so wretched a Creature; at this
time not onely not Amiable, but highly
Odious.</p>
            <p>While indeed man was yet uncreated
and unborn, tho' he had no positive
Perfection to present, and set him off
to Christ's view; yet he was at least ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively
clear: And, like unwritten paper,
though it has no Draughts to entertain,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107166:39"/>
yet neither has it any Blots to offend the
Eye; but is white, and innocent, and
fair for an after-Inscription. But man,
once fallen, was nothing, but a great
Blur; nothing, but a total universal
Pollution, and not to be reformed by
any thing under a New Creation.</p>
            <p>Yet, see here the Ascent, and progress
of Christ's Love. For first, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
man, in such a loathsome, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
condition; was it not Love e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that he was spared and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to enjoy a Being? since, not to put
a Traytor to Death, is a singular mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
But then, not only to continue his
Being, but to adorn it with Privilege,
and from the Number of <hi>Subjects</hi> to
take him into the Retinue of <hi>Servants,</hi> this
was yet a greater Love. For every one
that may be fit to be tolerated in a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's
Dominions, is not therefore fit to be
admitted into his Family: nor is any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Court to be commensurate to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
But then farther, to advance him
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107166:40"/>
from a <hi>Servant,</hi> to a <hi>Friend;</hi> from only li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in his House, to lying in his Bosom;
this is an Instance of Favour above the
Rate of a created goodness, an Act for
none, but the Son of God, who came to
do every thing in <hi>Miracle,</hi> to love super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally,
and to pardon infinitely,
and even to lay down the Sovereign,
while he assumed the Saviour.</p>
            <p>The Text speaks the winning Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
and gracious Condescension of
Christ to his Disciples, in owning them
for his Friends, who were more than suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
honoured by being his <hi>Servants.</hi>
For still these words of his must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
not according to the bare
Rigor of the Letter, but according to
the Arts and Allowances of Expression:
not as if the Relation of <hi>Friends</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
discharged them from that of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi>
but that of the two <hi>Relations,</hi>
Christ was pleased to over-look the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and without any mention of that,
to entitle and denominate them solely
from the more Honourable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:107166:40"/>
For the further illustration of which,
we must premise this, as a certain and
fundamental Truth, That so far as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
imports Duty and Subjection, all
created Beings, whether Men or Angels,
bear the necessary and essential Relation
of <hi>Servants</hi> to God, and consequently
to Christ, who is <hi>God Blessed for ever:</hi>
and this Relation is so necessary, that
God himself cannot dispense with it,
nor discharge a Rational Creature from
it: for although consequentially indeed
he may do so, by the Annihilation of
such a Creature, and the taking away
his Being, yet supposing the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his Being, God cannot effect,
that a Creature which has his Being from,
and his Dependance upon him, should
not stand obliged to do him the utmost
service that his nature enables Him to do.
For, to suppose the contrary, would be
irregular and opposite to the Law of
Nature, which, consisting in a fixed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
Relation of one Nature to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107166:41"/>
is, upon that account, even by God
himself, Indispensable. Forasmuch as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once made a Creature, he cannot
cause that <hi>that</hi> Creature should not owe a
Natural Relation to his Maker, both of
Subjection, and Dependance, (the very
Essence of a Creature importing so much)
to which Relation if he behaves himself
unsutably, he goes contrary to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Laws of it; which God,
the Author of Nature, cannot warrant
without being contrary to Himself. From
all which it follows, that even in our
highest estate of Sanctity and Privilege,
we yet retain the unavoidable obligation
of <hi>Christ's Servants;</hi> though still with an
Advantage as great as the Obligation,
where <hi>the service is perfect freedom:</hi> so
that with reference to such a Lord, <hi>to
serve,</hi> and <hi>to be free,</hi> are Terms not
Consistent only, but absolutely Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, since the Name of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
has of old been reckoned to imply
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107166:41"/>
a certain meanness of Mind, as well as
lowness of Condition, and the ill quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of many who served, have rendred
the condition it self not very creditable;
especially in those Ages, and places of
the World, in which the Condition of
Servants was extreamly different from
what it is now amongst us; they being
generally Slaves, and such as were bought
and sold for Money, and consequently
reckoned but amongst the other Goods
and Chattels of their Lord, or Master:
It was for this Reason, that Christ thought
fit to Wave the Appellation of <hi>Servant</hi>
here, as, according to the common use
of it amongst the Jews (and, at that
time most Nations besides) importing
these three Qualifications, which, being
directly contrary to the Spirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
were by no means to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in any of Christ's Disciples.</p>
            <p>1. The First whereof is that here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Text; <hi>viz.</hi> An utter unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with his Master's Designs, in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107166:42"/>
these words; <hi>The Servant knows not what
his Lord doeth.</hi> For seldom does any
man of sense make his Servant his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour,</hi>
for fear of making him his <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi>
too. A Master for the most
part keeps his choicest Goods lockt up
from his Servant, but much more his
Mind. A Servant is to know nothing,
but his Master's Commands; and in
these also, not to know the reason of
them.</p>
            <p>Neither is he to stand aloof off from
his Counsels onely, but sometimes from
his Presence also; and so far as decency
is duty, it is sometimes his duty to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
him. But the Voice of Christ in
his Gospel is, <hi>Come to me all ye that are
heavy laden.</hi> The Condition of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
staves him off to a distance; but
the Gospel speaks nothing but Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Attractives, and Invitation. <hi>The
Magisterial Law</hi> bids the Person under it,
<hi>Go, and he must go:</hi> But the Gospel
says to every Believer, <hi>Come, and he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107166:42"/>
cometh.</hi> A Servant dwells remote from
all Knowledge of his Lord's Purposes.
He lives as a kind of Foreigner under
the same Roof; a <hi>Domestick,</hi> and yet
a <hi>Stranger</hi> too.</p>
            <p>2dly, The Name of Servant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a slavish and degenerous Awe of
Mind: As it is in <hi>Rom. 8. 5. God has
not given us the spirit of Bondage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to fear.</hi> He who serves, has still
the low and ignoble restraints of Dread
upon his Spirit; which, in Business, and
even in the midst of Action, cramps and
ties up his Activity. He fears his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
anger, but designs not his favour.
<hi>Quicken me</hi> (says <hi>David) with thy free Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
It is the <hi>freedom</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that
gives worth and life to the performance.
But a Servant commonly is less free in
Mind than in Condition; his very Will
seems to be in bonds and shackles, and
Desire it self under a kind of Durance
and Captivity. In all that a Servant
does he is scarce a Voluntary Agent, but
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107166:43"/>
when he serves himself: All his Services
otherwise, not flowing naturally from
Propensity and Inclination, but being
drawn and forced from him by Terror
and Coaction. In any work he is put to,
let the Master withdraw his <hi>Eye,</hi> and
he will quickly take off his <hi>hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> The appellation of <hi>Servant,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a mercenary Temper and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
and denotes such an one as
makes his Reward, both the sole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and measure of his Obedience.
He neither Loves the thing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor the Person who commands it,
but is wholly and only intent upon his
own Emolument. All kindnesses done
Him, and all that is given Him, over
and above what is strictly <hi>just</hi> and <hi>his
due,</hi> makes Him rather worse than better.
And this is an observation that never
fails, where any one has so much boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and so little wit, as to make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.
For a Servant rarely or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ascribes what he receives, to the meer
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107166:43"/>
Liberality and Generosity of the Donor,
but to his own Worth and Merit, and to
the need which he supposes there is of
him; which opinion alone will be sure
to make any one of a mean, servile Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
insolent and intolerable.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewn what the
Qualities of a Servant usually are (or,
at least were in that Countrey, where our
Saviour lived and conversed, when he
spake these words) which, no doubt,
were the Cause why he would not treat
his Disciples (whom he designed to be
of a quite contrary Disposition) with
this Appellation.</p>
            <p>Come we therefore now in the next
place, to shew what is included in that
great Character, and Privilege which he
was pleased to vouchsafe both to them,
and to all Believers, in calling, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting them
his <hi>Friends.</hi> It includes
in it (I conceive) these following
Things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:107166:44"/>
1. Freedom of Access. House and
Heart, and all are open for the Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a friend. The Entrance is not beset
with solemn Excuses, and lingring Delays;
but the Passage is easie, and free from all
Obstruction, and not only admits, but
even invites the Comer. How different,
for the most part, is the same Man from
himself as he sustains the Person of a
Magistrate, and as he sustains that of a
Friend As a magistrate or great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
he locks himself up from all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
by the multiplied Formalities
of Attendance, by the Distance of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
and Grandeur; So many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Officers to be passed through, so
many Thresholds to be saluted, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Days to be spent in waiting for an
Opportunity of, perhaps, but half an
hour's Converse.</p>
            <p>But when He is to be entertain'd,
whose Friendship, not whose Business
demands an Entrance; those Formalities
presently disappear, all Impediments va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107166:44"/>
and the Rigours of the Magistrate,
submit to the Endearments of a Friend.
He opens and yields himself to the Man
of Business with difficulty and reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but offers himself to the visits of a
Friend with facility, and all the meeting
Readiness of Appetite and Desire. The
Reception of one is as different from the
Admission of the other, as when the
Earth falls open under the Incisions of
the Plough, and when it gapes and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
opens it self to drink in the Dew
of Heaven, or the Refreshments of a
Shower: or there is as much difference
between them, as when a Man reaches
out his Arms to take up a Burthen, and
when he reaches them out to embrace.</p>
            <p>'Tis confessed, that the vast Distance,
that Sin had put between the offending
Creature, and the offended Creatour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the help of some great Umpire,
and Intercessour, to open him a new way
of access to God; and this Christ did for
us as Mediatour. But we read of no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107166:45"/>
to bring us to Christ; For
though, being God by Nature, he dwells
in the height of Majesty, and the inacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Glories of a Deity; yet to keep off
all strangeness between himself, and the
Sons of Men, he has condescended to a
Cognation and Consanguinity with us,
he has cloathed himself with <hi>Flesh</hi> and
<hi>Blood,</hi> that so he might subdue his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to a Possibility of humane Converse.
And therefore, he that denies himself an
immediate Access to Christ, affronts
him in the great Relation of a Friend;
and as opening himself both to our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and to our Wants, with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Tenderness, and the freest Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There is none who acts a Friend by
a Deputy, or can be familiar by Proxy.</p>
            <p>2. The second Privilege of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is a favourable Construction of all
Passages between Friends, that are not
of so high, and so malign a Nature, as
to dissolve the Relation. <hi>Love covers
a multitude of Sins,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107166:45"/>
1 Pet.</hi> 4. 8. When a scar cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, the next kind Office is to
hide it. <hi>Love</hi> is never so <hi>blind,</hi> as
when it is to spy faults. It is like the
Painter, who being to draw the Picture
of a Friend having a Blemish in one Eye,
would picture only the other side of his
Face. It is a Noble, and a great
thing to cover the Blemishes, and to
excuse the failings of a Friend; to draw
a Curtain before his stains, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
his Perfections; to bury his Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
in silence, but to proclaim his
vertues upon the House-top. It is an
Imitation of the charities of Heaven,
which, when the Creature lies prostrate
in the weakness of sleep, and weariness,
spreads the Covering of Night, and
Darkness over it, to conceal it in that
Condition; But as soon as our Spirits
are refreshed, and Nature returns to its
morning Vigour, God then bids the Sun
rise, and the Day shine upon us, both
to advance and to shew that Activity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:107166:46"/>
It is the ennobling Office of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
to correct the fallacious
and mistaken Reports of Sense, and to
assure us that the Staff in the Water is
streight, though our Eye would tell us
it is crooked. So it is the Excellency
of Friendship to rectifie, or at least to
qualifie the Malignity of those Surmises,
that would mis-represent a Friend, and
traduce him in our Thoughts. Am I
told that my Friend has done me an
Injury, or that he has committed any
undecent Action? why, the first Debt
that I both owe to his Friendship, and
that he may challenge from mine, is
rather to question the Truth of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
than presently to believe my
Friend unworthy. Or if Matter of Fact
breaks out and blazes with too great an
Evidence to be denied, or so much as
doubted of; why, still there are other
Lenitives, that Friendship will apply,
before it will be brought to the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Rigours of a Condemning Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107166:46"/>
A Friend will be sure to act the
Part of <hi>an Advocate,</hi> before he will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
that of <hi>a Iudge.</hi> And there are
few Actions so ill, (unless they are of
a very deep and black Tincture indeed)
but will admit of some Extenuation at
least from those Common Topicks of
Humane Frailty; such as are Ignorance
or Inadvertency, Passion or Surprize,
Company or Sollicitation; with many
other such things, which may go a great
Way towards an Excusing of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi>
though they cannot absolutely
justifie the <hi>Action</hi> All which Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
<hi>for,</hi> and Alleviations of Faults,
though they are the Heights of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
yet they are not the Favours, but
the Duties of Friendship. Charity it
self commands us, where we know no
Ill, to think well of all. But Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that always goes a Pitch higher,
gives a Man a peculiar Right, and
Claim to the good Opinion of his
Friend. And, if we justly look upon a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107166:47"/>
Proneness <hi>to find faults,</hi> as a very ill and
a mean thing, we are to remember, that
a Proneness <hi>to believe them</hi> is next to it.</p>
            <p>We have seen here the Demeanour of
Friendship between Man and Man: but
how is it, think we now, between Christ,
and the Soul that depends upon him?
Is he any ways short in these Offices of
Tenderness and Mitigation? no assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but by infinite Degrees Superiour.
For where our Heart does but <hi>Relent,</hi> his
<hi>Melts;</hi> where our Eye pities, his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
yearn. How many Frowardnesses of
ours does he smother, how many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities
does he pass by, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Affronts does he put up at our hands,
because his Love is invincible, and his
Friendship unchangeable? He rates e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Action, every sinful Infirmity with
the Allowances of Mercy; and never
weighs the Sin, but together with it He
weighs the force of the Inducement;
how much of it is to be attributed to
Choice, how much to the Violence of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107166:47"/>
the Temptation, to the Stratagem of the
Occasion, and the yielding Frailties of
weak Nature.</p>
            <p>Should we try Men, at that rate, that
we try Christ, we should quickly find,
that the largest Stock of Humane friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
would be too little for us to spend
long upon. But his Compassion follows
us with an infinite Supply. He is God
in his <hi>Friendship,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Nature,</hi>
and therefore we sinfull Creatures are
not took upon Advantages, nor consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in our Provocations.</p>
            <p>See this exemplified in his Behaviour
to his Disciples, while he was yet upon
Earth: How ready was he to excuse and
cover their Infirmities! At the last and
bitterest Scene of his Life, when he was
so full of Agony and Horrour upon the
Approach of a dismal Death, and so had
most need of the Refreshments of Society,
and the friendly Assistances of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
and when also he desired no more
of them, but only for a while to sit up
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107166:48"/>
and pray with Him. Yet they, like Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
wholly untouched with his Agonies,
and unmoved with his Passionate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
forget both his, and their own
Cares, and securely sleep away all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for him, or themselves either. Now,
what a fierce, and sarcastick Reprehension
may we imagine this would have drawn
from the Friendships of the World, that
act but to an Humane Pitch! and yet
what a gentle one did it receive from
Christ! In <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 40? No more
than, <hi>What could you not watch with me for
one hour?</hi> And when from this Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
they took only occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double
their Fault, and to sleep again,
so that upon a second, and third Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
they had nothing to plead for
their unseasonable Drowsiness, yet then
Christ, who was the only Person concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to have resented, and aggravated
this their Unkindness, finds an Extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for it, when they themselves could
not. <hi>The Spirit indeed is willing</hi> (says
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107166:48"/>
he) but the Flesh is weak. As if he
had said, I know your Hearts, and am
satisfied of your Affection, and therefore
accept your Will, and compassionate
your Weakness. So benign, so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is the Friendship of Christ, so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to our Wants, so sutable to
our Frailties. Happy that Man, who
has a Friend to point out to him the
Perfection of Duty, and yet to pardon
him in the Lapses of his Infirmity.</p>
            <p>3. The third Privilege of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is a Sympathy in <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Grief.</hi>
When a Man shall have diffused his
Life, his self, and his whole Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
so far, that he can weep his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
with anothers Eyes; when he has
another Heart besides his own, both to
share, and to support his Griefs, and
when, if his Joys overflow, he can trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
up the Overplus and Redundancy of
them in another Breast; so that he can
(as it were) shake off the Solitude of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Nature, by dwelling in two Bodies
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107166:49"/>
at once, and living by anothers Breath,
this surely is the Height, the very Spirit
and Perfection of all humane Felicities.</p>
            <p>It is a true and happy Observation
of that great Philosopher the Lord <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulam,</hi>
that this is the Benefit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of our Minds to others, <hi>That
Sorrows by being Communicated grow less,
and Ioys greater.</hi> And indeed, Sorrow,
like a Stream, loses it self in many
Channels; and Joy, like a Ray of the
Sun, reflects with a greater Ardour, and
Quickness, when it rebounds upon a
Man from the Breast of his Friend.</p>
            <p>Now Friendship is the only Scene,
upon which the Glorious Truth of this
great Proposition, can be fully acted
and drawn forth. Which indeed is a
Summary Description of the Sweets of
Friendship: and the whole Life of a
Friend, in the several Parts and Instances of
it, is only a more diffuse Comment upon,
and a plainer Explication of this Divine
Aphorism. Friendship never restrains a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107166:49"/>
Pleasure to a single Fruition. But such
is the Royal Nature of this Quality,
that it still expresses it self in the Style
of Kings, as <hi>We do</hi> this, or That; and
This is <hi>our</hi> happiness; and such or such
a thing belongs <hi>to us;</hi> when the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Possession of it is vested only in
one. Nothing certainly in Nature, can
so peculiarly gratifie the Noble Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of Humanity, as for one man to
see another so much himself, as to sigh
his Griefs, and groan his Pains, to sing his
Joys, and (as it were) to do and feel e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing by Sympathy, and secret inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
Communications. Thus it is
upon an humane Account.</p>
            <p>Let us now see, how Christ sustains
and makes good this generous Quality
of a Friend. And this we shall find fully
set forth to us, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. Where he
is said to be a <hi>mercifull High Priest, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the feeling of our Infirmities; and
that in all our Afflictions he is afflicted, Isa.</hi>
63. 9. And no doubt, with the same
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107166:50"/>
Bowels and Meltings of Affection, with
which any tender Mother hears and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moans
the Groanings of her sick Child,
does Christ hear and sympathize with
the spiritual Agonies of a Soul under
Desertion, or the Pressures of some
stinging Affliction. It is enough that he
understands the Exact Measures of our
Strengths, and Weaknesses; that <hi>he knows</hi>
our Frame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is in <hi>Psalm</hi> 03. 14.
And that he does not only know, but
Emphatically, that he <hi>remembers</hi> also <hi>that
we are but Dust:</hi> Observe that signal Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of his loving Commiseration; As
soon as he had risen from the Dead, and
met <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 7. he
sends this Message of his Resurrection by
her. Go <hi>Tell my Disciples</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> that
<hi>I am risen.</hi> What? was not <hi>Peter</hi> one
of his Disciples? Why then is he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
particularly and by himself, as
if he were exempted out of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?
Why, we know into what a
plunge he had newly cast himself by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107166:50"/>
denying his Master: upon occasion of
which he was now strugling with all the
Perplexities and Horrours of Mind ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
least Christ might in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
deny and disown him <hi>before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and so repay one Denial with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Hereupon Christ particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the Comforts of his Resurrection to
him, as if he had said. <hi>Tell all my Disciples,</hi>
but be sure especially to tell poor <hi>Peter,
that I am risen from the Dead;</hi> and that,
notwithstanding his Denial of me, the
Benefits of my Resurrection belong to
him, as much as to any of the rest.
This is the Privilege of the Saints, to
have a Companion and a Supporter in
all their Miseries, in all the doubtfull
Turnings and dolefull Passages of their
Lives. In summ, this Happiness does
Christ vouchsafe to all his, that as a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
he once suffered for them, and that
as a <hi>Friend</hi> he always <hi>suffers with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The fourth Privilege of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is that which is here specified in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107166:51"/>
Text, a Communication of Secrets. A
Bosom secret and a Bosom friend are
usually put together. And this from
Christ to the Soul, is not only Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but also Honour and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
'tis for him to vouch it one of
his Privy Council. Nothing under a
Jewel is taken into the Cabinet. A se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
is the Apple of our Eye; it will
bear no Touch, nor Approach, we use
to cover nothing, but what we account
a Rarity. And therefore to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
a Secret to any one, is to exalt him to
one of the Royalties of Heaven. For
none knows the Secrets of a Man's
Mind, but his God, his Conscience, and
his Friend. Neither would any prudent
Man let such a thing go out of his own
Heart, had he not another Heart besides
his own to receive it.</p>
            <p>Now it was of old a Privilege, with
which God was pleased to honour such
as served him at the Rate of an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Obedience, thus to admit them
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107166:51"/>
to a Knowledge of many of his great
Counsels lock'd up from the rest of the
World. When God had designed the
Destruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
him as unable to conceal that
great Purpose from <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom he
always treated as <hi>his Friend,</hi> and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
that is, not only with Love,
but also with Intimacy and Familiarity,
in <hi>Genes.</hi> 18. v. 17. <hi>And the Lord said, shall
I hide from Abraham the thing that I go about
to do?</hi> He thought it a Violation of the
Rights of Friendship to reserve his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
wholly to himself. And St. <hi>Iames</hi>
tells us, in <hi>Iam. 2. 23. That Abraham
was called the Friend</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had a Kind of Claim to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his Secrets, and the Participation
of his Counsels. Also in <hi>Exodus</hi> 33.
v. 11. It is said of God, <hi>that he spoke to
Moses as a Man speaketh to his Friend.</hi>
And that, not only for the Familiarity
and Facility of Address, but also for the
peculiar Communications of his Mind.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107166:52"/>
               <hi>Moses</hi> was with him in the Retirements
of the Mount, received there his Dictates,
and his private Instructions, as his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Viceroy; and when the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and Congregation of <hi>Israel</hi> were
thundred away, and kept off from any
approach to it, he was honour'd with an
intimate and immediate admission. The
Priests indeed were taken into a near
attendance upon God; but still there
was a degree of a nearer Converse, and
the Interest of a <hi>Friend</hi> was above the
Privileges of the highest <hi>Servant.</hi> In
<hi>Exod. 19. 24. Thou shalt come up</hi> (says
God) <hi>thou and Aaron with thee, but let
not the Priests and the People break through
to come up unto the Lord, lest the Lord
break forth upon them.</hi> And if we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
further, we shall still find a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of the same Privilege: <hi>Psalm
25. 14. The secret of the Lord is with them
that fear him.</hi> Nothing is to be conceal'd
from the other self. To be a Friend, and
to be Conscious are terms equivalent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:107166:52"/>
Now if God maintained such Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
with those, whom he loved, under
the <hi>Law,</hi> (which was a Dispensation of
greater Distance,) we may be sure that
under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> (the very Nature of
which imports Condescension, and
Compliance) there must needs be the
same, with much greater Advantage.
And therefore when <hi>God</hi> had <hi>manifested
himself in the Flesh,</hi> how sacredly did he
preserve this Privilege? how freely did
Christ unbosom himself to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?
in <hi>Luke 8. 10. Unto you</hi> (says
he) <hi>it is given to know the mysteries of
the Kingdom of God: but unto others in
Parables; that seeing they might not see:</hi>
Such shall be permitted to cast an Eye
into the Ark, and to look into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Holy of holies.</hi> And again in <hi>Matth.
13. 17. Many Prophets and righteous
men have desired to see those things which
ye see, and have not seen them: and to
hear those things which ye hear, and have
not heard them.</hi> Neither did he treat
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107166:53"/>
them with these peculiarities of favour
in the extraordinary discoveries of the
Gospel only, but also of those incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
Revelations of the Divine
Love, in reference to their own personal
interest in it. In <hi>Rev. 2. 17. To him
that overcometh will I give to eat of the
hidden Manna, and will give him a white
stone, and in the stone a new name written,
which no man knoweth, saving he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
it.</hi> Assurance is a Rarity co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the Inspection of the world.
A secret that none can know, but God,
and the person that is blessed with it.
It is writ in a private Character, not to
be read, nor understood but by the
Conscience, to which the Spirit of God
has vouchsafed to decypher it. Every
Believer lives upon an inward provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Comfort, that the world is a
stranger to.</p>
            <p>5. The fifth advantage of Friendship
is <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Advice.</hi> A man will
sometimes need not only another
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107166:53"/>
               <hi>Heart,</hi> but also another <hi>head</hi> besides
his own. In solitude there is not only
discomfort; but weakness also. And
that saying of the wise man <hi>Eccles. 4. 10.
Woe to him that is alone,</hi> is verified upon
none so much, as upon the Friendless
person: When a man shall be perplex'd
with Knots and Problems of business
and contrary affairs; where the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
is dubious, and both parts of
the Contrariety seem equally weighty,
so that which way soever the Choice
determines, a man is sure to venture a
great Concern. How happy then is it
to fetch in aid from another person,
whose judgment may be greater than
my own, and whose Concernment is
sure not to be less! There are some
passages of a man's affairs that would
quite break a single understanding. So
many intricacies, so many Labyrinths,
are there in them, that the Succours of
reason fail, the very force and spirit of
it being lost in an actual Intention scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107166:54"/>
upon several clashing objects at
once; in which case the Interposal of
a Friend is like the supply of a fresh
party to a besieged, yielding City.</p>
            <p>Now Christ is not failing in this office
of a friend also. For in that illustrious
prediction of <hi>Esay</hi> 9. 6. amongst the
rest of his great Titles, he is called <hi>might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Counsellor.</hi> And his Counsel is not
only sure, but also free. It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel of Christ, as under some
Laws of Men, where you must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to buy your Counsel, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
pay dear for bad advice. No,
<hi>He is a light to those that sit in darkness.</hi>
And no man fees the Sun, no man pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases
the Light, nor errs, if he walks by
it. The only price, that Christ sets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Counsel, is, that we follow it;
and that we do that, which is best for us
to doe. He is not only Light for us to
see by, but also <hi>Light</hi> for us to see <hi>with.</hi> He
is <hi>understanding to the ignorant,</hi> and <hi>Eyes
to the Blind:</hi> And whosoever has both a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107166:54"/>
faithfull and a discreet friend, to guide
him in the dark, slippery, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
passages of his Life, may carry his
Eyes in another mans head, and yet see
never the worse. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. the
Apostle tells us, that Christ is made to
us, not only <hi>Sanctification and Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but <hi>Wisdom</hi> too: We are his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and it is but Natural, that all the
Members, of the Body, should be guided
by the wisdom of the Head.</p>
            <p>And therefore let every Believer
comfort himself in this high Privilege,
That in the great things, that concern his
eternal Peace, he is not left to stand or
fall by the uncertain directions of his
own judgment. No, sad were his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
if he should be so; when he is to
encounter an Enemy made up of Wiles
and Stratagems, an old serpent, and a long
experienced Deceiver, and successfull at
the Trade for some thousands of years.</p>
            <p>The Inequality of the match, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
such an one, and the subtillest of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107166:55"/>
us would quickly appear by a fatal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvention:
There must be a <hi>wisdom
from above</hi> to over-reach and master this
Hellish wisdom <hi>from beneath.</hi> And this
every sanctifyed Person is sure of in his
great Friend, <hi>in whom all the treasures of
wisdom dwell.</hi> Treasures that flow out,
and are imparted freely both in directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and assistance to all that belong to
him. He never leaves any of His, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd,
amazed, or bewildred, where
the welfare of their Souls requires a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
judgment than their own, either to
guide them in their Duty, or to disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
them from a Temptation. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
has Christ for his Friend, shall be
sure of Counsel, and whosoever is his
own Friend, will be sure to obey it.</p>
            <p>6. The last and crowning Privilege,
or rather property of Friendship is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</hi>
He onely is a Friend, whose
Friendship lives as long as himself; and
who ceases to <hi>Love,</hi> and to <hi>Breath</hi> at
the same instant. Not that I yet state
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107166:55"/>
Constancy in such an absurd, senceless,
and irrational Continuance in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as no Injuries, or Provocations
whatsoever, can break off. For there
are some Injuries that extinguish the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Relation between Friends. <hi>In which
case,</hi> a man ceases to be a Friend, not
from any Inconstancy in his Friendship,
but from Defect of an Object for his
Friendship to exert it self upon. It is
one thing for a Father to cease to be a
Father, by casting off his Son; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
for him to cease to be so, by the
Death of his Son. In this the <hi>Relation</hi>
is at an end for want of a Correlate:
So in Friendship, there are some passages
of that high and hostile Nature, that
they really and properly constitute and
denominate the Person guilty of them,
an Enemy; and if so, how can the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Person possibly continue a friend,
since Friendship essentially requires that
it be between Two at least; and there
can be no Friendship, where there are not
Two friends?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:107166:56"/>
No body is bound to look upon his
Back-biter, or his Underminer; his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer,
or his Oppressor, as his friend.
Nor indeed, is it possible that he should
doe so, unless he could alter the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
and Order of Things; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
a new Nature, and a new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
in the World. For to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
of such Provocations, is not
Constancy, but Apathy. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they discharge the Person, so treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
from the proper Obligations of a
Friend; though Christianity, I confess,
binds him to the Duties of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>But to give you the true Nature, and
Measures of Constancy; It is such a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and firmness of Friendship, as
overlooks, and passes by all those lesser
failures of Kindness and Respect, that
partly through Passion, partly through
Indiscretion, and such other frailties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to Humane Nature, a man may
be sometimes guilty of, and yet still
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107166:56"/>
retain the same habitual Good-will, and
prevailing Propensity of Mind, to his
friend, that he had before. And whose
Friendship soever is of that strength, and
duration, as to stand its ground against,
and remain unshaken by such assaults;
(which yet are strong enough to shake
down and annihilate the Friendship of
little puny Minds;) such an one (I say)
has reached all the true measures of
Constancy: His Friendship is of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Make, and a lasting Consistency;
it resembles Marble, and deserves to be
wrote upon it.</p>
            <p>But how few Tempers in the World,
are of that magnanimous Frame, as to
reach the heights of so great a Vertue:
Many offer at the Effects of Friendship,
but they doe not last; they are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in the Beginning, but they fail, and
jade, and tire in the Prosecution. For
most people in the World are acted by
Levity, and Humour, by strange and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Changes. And how often may we
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107166:57"/>
meet with those, who are one while
courteous, civil, and obliging, (at least
to their proportion;) but within a small
time after, are so supercilious, sharp,
troublesome, fierce, and exceptious, that
they are not only short of the true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Friendship, but become the
very Sores and Burthens of Society?
Such low, such worthless Dispositions,
how easily are they discovered, how
justly are they despised? But now that
we may pass from one Contrary to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>Christ, who is the same yesterday, to
day, and for ever, in his Being,</hi> is so also
in his <hi>Affection.</hi> He is not of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or Nature, of those pitifull, mean
pretenders to Friendship, who perhaps
will love and smile upon you one day,
and not so much as know you the next:
Many of which sort there are in the
World, who are not so much courted
outwardly, but that inwardly they are
detested much more.</p>
            <p>Friendship is a kind of Covenant;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107166:57"/>
and most Covenants run upon mutual
Terms and Conditions. And therefore
so long as we are Exact in fulfilling the
Condition on our parts, I mean, Exact
according to the measures of <hi>Sincerity,</hi>
though not of <hi>Perfection,</hi> we may be
sure, that <hi>Christ</hi> will not fail in the least
<hi>Iota</hi> to fulfill every thing on his. The
favour of Relations, Patrons and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
is uncertain, ticklish and variable;
and the Friendship which they take up,
upon the Accounts of Judgment, and
Merit, they most times lay down out of
Humour. But the Friendship of <hi>Christ</hi>
has none of these weaknesses, no such
hollowness or unsoundness in it. <hi>For
neither Principalities nor Powers, things
present, nor things to come;</hi> no, nor all
the rage and malice of Hell shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to pluck the meanest of <hi>Christ</hi>'s friends
out of his Bosom. For, <hi>whom he loves,
he loves to the End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from the Particulars hitherto
discoursed of, we may inferr and learn
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107166:58"/>
these two things: 1. The <hi>Excellency,</hi>
and Value of Friendship, Christ <hi>the Son
of the most High God,</hi> the second Person
in the glorious Trinity, took upon him
<hi>our Nature,</hi> that he might give a great
Instance and Example of this Vertue;
and condescended to be <hi>a Man,</hi> only
that he might be <hi>a Friend.</hi> Our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
our, Lord and King he was before;
but he would needs come down from
all this, and in a sort become our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
that he might partake of that
Noble Quality that is properly between
<hi>Equals.</hi> Christ took not upon him <hi>Flesh</hi>
and <hi>Blood,</hi> that he might conquer and
rule Nations, lead Armies, or possess
Palaces; but that he might have the
Relenting, the Tenderness, and the
Compassions of Humane Nature, which
render it properly capable of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
and, in a word, that he might
have <hi>our Heart</hi> and we have His. God
himself sets Friendship above all Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
of Kindred or Consanguinity,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107166:58"/>
as the greatest Ground and Argument
of mutual Endearment, in <hi>Deut. 15. 6.
If thy Brother, the Son of thy Mother, or
thy Son, or thy Daughter, or the Wife of
thy Bosom, or thy Friend, which is as thine
own Soul, entice thee to go and serve other
Gods, thou shalt not consent unto him.</hi>
The Emphasis of the Expression is very
remarkable, it being a Gradation, or
Ascent, by several degrees of Dearness,
to that which is the Highest of all.
Neither <hi>Wife,</hi> nor <hi>Brother, Son</hi> nor <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
though the nearest in Cognation,
are allowed to stand in Competion with
<hi>a friend;</hi> who, if he fully answers the
Duties of that great Relation, is indeed
better, and more valuable, than all of
them put together, and may serve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of them; so that he, who has a
firm, a worthy, and sincere friend, may
<hi>want</hi> all the rest, without <hi>missing</hi> them.
That which lies in a man's Bosom,
should be dear to him; but that which
lies within his Heart, ought to be much
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107166:59"/>
dearer. 2. In the next place, we learn
from hence the high Advantage of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truly Pious and Religious. When
we have said, and done all; it is only
the true Christian, and the Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who is, or can be, sure of a friend;
sure of obtaining, sure of keeping him.
But as for the friendship of the World;
when a man shall have done all that
he can to make one his <hi>friend,</hi> imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the utmost of his Wit and Labour,
beaten his Brains, and emptied his
Purse, to create an Endearment between
him and the Person, whose friendship he
desires, he may, in the end, upon all
these Endeavours, and Attempts, be
forced to write <hi>Vanity</hi> and Frustration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For, by them all, he may at last be no
more able to get into the other's Heart,
than he is to thrust his hand into a Pillar
of Brass. The man's Affection, amidst
all these Kindnesses done him, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wholly unconcerned, and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
just like a Rock, which being
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107166:59"/>
plied continually by the Waves, still
throws them back again into the Bosom
of the Sea that sent them, but is not at
all moved by any of them.</p>
            <p>People at first, while they are young
and raw, and soft natured, are apt to
think it an easie thing to gain Love,
and reckon their own friendship a sure
price of another man's. But when Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
shall have once opened their
Eyes, and shewn them the hardness of
most Hearts, the hollowness of others,
and the Baseness and Ingratitude of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all, they will then find, that a
friend <hi>is the gift of God;</hi> and that He
only, who made Hearts, can unite
them. For it is He, who creates those
Sympathies, and sutablenesses of Nature,
that are the foundation of all true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and then by his Providence brings
Persons so affected together.</p>
            <p>It is an Expression frequent in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but infinitely more insignificant,
than at first it is usually observed to be:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107166:60"/>
Namely, <hi>That God gave such or such a
person grace, or favour in another's Eyes.</hi>
As for instance; in <hi>Genes.</hi> 39. 21. it is
said of <hi>Ioseph, That the Lord was with him,
and gave him favour in the sight of the
Keeper of the Prison.</hi> Still it is an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Hand from Heaven, that ties this
Knot, and mingles Hearts, and Souls,
by strange, secret, and unaccountable
Conjunctions.</p>
            <p>That Heart shall surrender it self, and
its friendship, to one man, at first view,
which another has, in vain, been laying
Siege to for many years, by all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Acts of Kindness imaginable.</p>
            <p>Nay, so far is Friendship from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any humane Production, that,
unless Nature be pre-disposed to it, by
its own Propensity or Inclination, no
Arts of Obligation shall be able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
the secret Hatreds, and Hostilities
of some Persons towards others. No
friendly Offices, no Addresses, no Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
whatsoever, shall ever alter or allay
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107166:60"/>
that Diabolical Rancour, that frets and
ferments in some hellish Breasts, but
that upon all occasions it will foam
out at its foul mouth in Slander and
Invective, and sometimes bite too in
a shrewd Turn or a <hi>secret Blow.</hi>
This is true and undeniable upon fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>Experience;</hi> and happy those
who can learn it at the Cost of other
men's.</p>
            <p>But now, on the contrary, he who
will give up his Name to Christ in <hi>Faith
unfeigned,</hi> and a sincere Obedience to all
his Righteous Laws, shall be sure to find
<hi>Love</hi> for <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Friendship</hi> for <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi>
The Success is certain and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;
and none ever yet miscarried in
the Attempt. For Christ freely offers
his Friendship to all; and sets no other
rate upon so vast a purchase, but only
that we would suffer him to be our
<hi>Friend.</hi> Thou perhaps spendest thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
time in waiting upon such a great
One, and thy Estate in presenting him;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107166:61"/>
and, probably, after all, hast no other
reward, but sometimes to be <hi>smiled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and always to be <hi>smiled at;</hi> and
when thy greatest and most pressing
Occasions shall call for succour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
then to be deserted and cast off,
<hi>and not known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, I say, turn the stream of thy
Endeavours another way, and bestow
but half that hearty, sedulous attendance
upon thy Saviour, in the Duties of Prayer
and Mortification; and be at half that
Expence in Charitable Works, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Christ in his poor Members;
and, in a word, study as much to please
him <hi>who died for thee,</hi> and thou dost to
court and humour thy great Patron,
who <hi>cares not for thee,</hi> and thou shalt
make him thy friend for ever; A friend,
who shall own thee in thy lowest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
speak Comfort to thee in all thy
Sorrows, Counsel thee in all thy Doubts,
answer all thy Wants, and, in a word,
<hi>never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</hi> But
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107166:61"/>
when all the hopes, that thou hast raised
upon the promises, or supposed kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the fastidious, and fallacious
great Ones of the World, shall fail, and
upbraid thee to thy face, he shall then
take thee into his Bosom, embrace, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and support thee; and, as the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>
expresses it, <hi>He shall guide thee with
his Counsel here, and afterwards receive thee
into Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which God of his Mercy vouchsafe
to bring us all; To whom be rendred
and ascribed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Amen.</p>

Honour suffer by his Condescension.</p>
            <p>In the Words we have these three
Things observable.</p>
            <p>1. That whosoever appears in the
House of God, and particularly in the
Way of Prayer, ought to reckon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in a more especial manner, placed
in the sight and presence of God.</p>
            <p>2. That the vast and infinite distance
between God and Him, ought to create
in him all imaginable Awe, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in such his Addresses to God.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly;</hi> That this Reverence
required of him, is to consist in a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
preparation of his Thoughts, and
a sober government of his Expressions:
Neither is <hi>his Mouth to be rash, nor his
Heart to be hastly, in uttering any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:107166:64"/>
These things are evidently contained
in the Words, and doe as evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the whole sence of them. But I
shall gather them all into this one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
Namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Premeditation of Thought, and
Brevity of Expression, are the great Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
of that Reverence, that is required to
a pious, acceptable, and devout Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better handling of which, we
will, in the first place, consider how,
and by what way it is, that <hi>Prayer</hi>
works upon, or prevails with God, for
the obtaining of the things, we pray
for. Concerning which, I shall lay
down this General Rule, That the Way,
by which Prayer prevails with God, is
wholly different from that, by which
it prevails with Men. And to give
you this more particularly.</p>
            <p>1. First of all, It prevails not with
God by way of <hi>Information</hi> or Notifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Thing to Him, which we
desire of Him. With Men, indeed, this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107166:65"/>
is the common, and with Wise men
the chief, and should be the only way
of obtaining what we ask of them. We
represent, and lay before them our
Wants and Indigences, and the misery
of our Condition; Which being made
known to them, the Quality and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Thing asked for, and of
the Persons, who ask it, induces them
to give that to us, and to doe that for
us, which we desire, and petition for:
But it is not so in our Addresses to God;
for he knows our Wants, and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
better than we our selves: He
is before-hand with all our Prayers,
<hi>Matth. 6. 8. Your Father knoweth what
things ye have need of before ye ask him:</hi>
And in <hi>Psal. 139. 2. Thou understandest
my thought afar off.</hi> God knows our
Thoughts before the very Heart that
conceives them. And how then can he,
who is but of yesterday, suggest any
thing new to that Eternal mind! how
can Ignorance inform Omniscience!
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107166:65"/>
2<hi>ly.</hi> Neither does Prayer prevail with
God by way of <hi>perswasion,</hi> or working
upon the Affections, so, as thereby to
move him to pity or compassion. This
indeed is the most usual, and most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
way to prevail with Men; who,
for the generality are, one part <hi>Reason,</hi>
and nine parts <hi>Affection.</hi> So that one
of a voluble Tongue, and a dextrous
Insinuation, may doe what he will with
vulgar Minds, and with Wise men too,
at their weak times. But God, who is
as void of Passion, or Affection, as he is
of Quantity, or Corporeity, is not to
be dealt with this way. He values not
our Rhetorick, nor our pathetical Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues.
He who applies to God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
to an Infinite Almighty Reason, a
pure Act, all Intellect, The first Mover,
and therefore not to be moved, or
wrought upon Himself. In all Passion,
the Mind suffers (as the very significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Word imports,) but abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
entire perfection cannot suffer; it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107166:66"/>
is and must be Immoveable, and by
consequence Impassible. And therefore,
in the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> place, much less
is God to be prevailed upon by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and (as it were) wearying
him into a Concession of what we beg
of him. Though with Men, we know,
this also is not unusual. A Notable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of which we have in <hi>Luke 18. v.</hi>
4, 5. where the unjust Judge being with
a restless Vehemence sued to for Justice,
says thus within himself: <hi>Though I fear
not God, nor regard Man, yet because this
Widow troubleth me I will avenge her, lest
by her continual Coming she weary me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, how often are Beggars
relieved only for their eager and rude
Importunity; not that the person who
relieves them, is thereby informed or
satisfied of their real Want, nor yet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to pity them by all their Cry and
Cant, but to rid himself from their
vexatious Noise and Din; so that to
purchase his Quiet by a little Alms, he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107166:66"/>
gratifies the Beggar; but indeed <hi>relieves</hi>
himself. But now, this way is further
from prevailing with God, than either
of the former. For as Omniscience is
not to be informed, so neither is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence
to be wearied. We may
much more easily think to clamour
the Sun and Stars out of their Courses,
than to word the great Creator of them
out of the steady purposes of his own
Will, by all the vehemence and loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Petitions. Men may tire
themselves with their own Prayers, but
God is not to be tired. The rapid
motion, and whirl of things here below,
interrupts not the inviolable Rest and
Calmness of the Nobler Beings above.
While the Winds roar and bluster here
in the First and Second Regions of the
Air, there is a perfect serenity in the
Third. Men's Desires cannot controll
God's Decrees.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewn, that the
Three ways by which <hi>Men prevail with
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107166:67"/>
Men,</hi> in their Prayers and Applications
to them, have no place at all, in giving
any efficacy to their Addresses to God.</p>
            <p>But you will ask then, Upon what
account is it, that Prayer becomes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
and efficacious with God, so as
to procure us the good things we pray
for? I answer upon this; That it is
the fulfilling of that <hi>Condition,</hi> upon
which God has freely promised to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
his Blessings to Men. God, of his
own absolute, unaccountable good will
and pleasure, has thought fit to appoint
and fix upon this, as the means by which
he will supply and answer the Wants
of Mankind. As for instance; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Prince should declare to any
one of his Subjects, that if he shall
appear before him every morning in
his Bed-chamber, shall receive of him
a thousand Talents. We must not
here imagine, that the Subject, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this appearance, does either move
or perswade his Prince to give him such
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107166:67"/>
a Summ of Money: No, he only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
the Condition of the promise, and
thereby acquires a Right to the thing
promised. He does indeed hereby <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage</hi>
his Prince to give him this Summ,
though he does by no means <hi>perswade</hi>
him: Or rather, to speak more strictly
and properly, the Prince's own Justice,
and Veracity, is an Engagement upon
the Prince himself, to make good his
promise to him, who fulfills the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of it.</p>
            <p>But you will say, That, upon this
Ground it will follow, that when we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any thing of God by Prayer, we
have it upon Claim of Justice, and not
by Way of Gift, as a free Result of his
Bounty.</p>
            <p>I answer; that both these are very
well consistent; for though he, who
makes a Promise upon a certain Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is bound in Justice, upon the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of that Condition, to perform his
promise; yet it was perfectly Grace and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107166:68"/>
Goodness: Bounty and free Mercy, that
first induced him to make the Promise,
and particularly to state the Tenour of
it, upon such a Condition. <hi>If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
our Sins,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>I Iohn
1. 9. God is faithfull and just to forgive us
our Sins.</hi> Can any thing be freer, and
more the Effect of meer Grace, than
the Forgiveness of Sins? And yet it is
certain from this Scripture and many
more, that it is firmly promised us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Condition of a penitent hearty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of them; and consequently, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that God stands oblig'd here even
by his <hi>Faithfulness and Iustice,</hi> to make good
this his Promise of Forgiveness to those
who come up to the Terms of it by
such a Confession.</p>
            <p>In like manner, for Prayer, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the good Things prayed for.
He who prays for a thing, as God has
appointed him, gets thereby a right to
the thing prayed for: But it is a Right,
not springing from any Merit or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107166:68"/>
either in the Prayer it self, or
the Person who makes it, to the <hi>Blessing,</hi>
which he prays for; but from God's Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity,
Truth, and Justice, who having
appointed Prayer as the <hi>Condition</hi> of that
<hi>Blessing,</hi> cannot but stand to what he
himself had appointed; Though that he
did appoint it, was the free Result and
Determination of his own Will.</p>
            <p>We have a full Account of this whole
Matter from God's own Mouth, in
<hi>Psalm 50. Call upon me</hi> (says God) <hi>in the
day of trouble, and I will deliver thee.</hi>
These are evidently the Terms, upon
which God answers Prayers: In which
Case, there is no doubt, but the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
is still of more Worth than the
Prayer; and there is as little doubt also,
that without such a previous declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made on God's part, a person so in
Trouble or Distress might pray his Heart
out, and yet God not be in the least
obliged by all his Prayers, either in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
or Honour, or indeed so much as
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107166:69"/>
in Mercy to deliver him; for Mercy is
free, and Misery cannot oblige it. In
a word, Prayer procures <hi>deliverance from
Trouble,</hi> just as <hi>Naaman</hi>'s dipping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
seven times in <hi>Iordan</hi> procured him
a Deliverance from his Leprosie; not by
any Vertue in it self adequate to so great
an Effect, you may be sure; but from
this, That it was appointed by God as
the Condition of his Recovery; and so
obliged the Power of him, who appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, to give force and vertue to his
own Institution, beyond what the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Thing it self could otherwise
have raised it to.</p>
            <p>Let this therefore be fix'd upon, as
the Ground-work of what we are to say
upon this Subject: That Prayer prevails
with God for the <hi>Blessing</hi> that we pray
for, neither by Way of <hi>Information,</hi> nor
yet of <hi>Persuasion,</hi> and much less by the
<hi>Importunity</hi> of him who prays, and least
of all by any <hi>Worth</hi> in the Prayer it self,
equal to the Thing prayed for; but it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107166:69"/>
prevails solely, and intirely upon this
Account, that it is freely appointed by
God, as the stated, allowed <hi>Condition,</hi>
upon which he will dispence his Blessings
to Mankind.</p>
            <p>But before I dismiss this Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it may be enquired; <hi>Whence it is</hi>
that Prayer, rather than any other thing,
comes to be appointed by God for this
<hi>Condition.</hi> In answer to which, Tho'
God's Soveraign Will be a sufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of its own Counsels and Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and consequently a more than
sufficient Answer to all our Enquiries;
yet since God in his Infinite Wisdom
still adapts means to Ends, and never
appoints a Thing to any use, but what
it has a particular, and a natural Fitness
for; I shall therefore presume to assign
a Reason, why Prayer, before all other
things, should be appointed to this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
use, of being the Condition and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Conduit whereby to derive the
Bounties of Heaven upon the Sons of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107166:70"/>
Men. And it is this; because Prayer, of
all other Acts of a Rational Nature, does
most peculiarly qualify a Man to be a
fit Object of the Divine Favour, by
being most eminently and properly <hi>an
Act of Dependance upon God:</hi> Since to
pray, or beg a thing of another, in the
very Nature and Notion of it, imports
these two Things: 1. That the Person
praying stands in need of some Good,
which he is not able by any Power of
his own to procure for himself: And,
2. That he acknowledges it in the power,
and pleasure of the Person, whom he
prays to, to conferr it upon him. And
this is properly that which Men call <hi>to
depend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some may reply; There is an
Universal Dependance of all things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God; for as much as, He being the
great Fountain, and Source of Being
first Created, and since supports them by
the word of his Power; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that this Dependance belongs
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107166:70"/>
indifferently to the <hi>Wicked</hi> as well as to
the <hi>Iust,</hi> whose <hi>Prayer</hi> nevertheless is
declared <hi>an Abomination to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to this the Answer is obvious, That
the Dependance here spoken of is meant,
not of a <hi>Natural,</hi> but of a <hi>Moral</hi> Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
The first is Necessary, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Voluntary. The first Common to
all, the other proper to the Pious. The
first respects God barely as a Creator, the
other addresses to him also as a Father.
Now such a Dependance upon God it
is, that is properly seen in Prayer. And
being so, if we should in all humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
set our selves to examine the
Wisdom of the Divine proceeding in
this Matter, even by the Measures of
our own Reason, what could be more
Rationally thought of for the properest
Instrument, to bring down God's Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
upon the World, than such a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Mind, as makes a Man disown
all Ability in himself to supply his own
Wants, and at the same time own a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107166:71"/>
Transcendent Fulness and sufficiency in
God to do it for him? And what can
be more agreeable to all Principles both
of Reason and Religion, than that a
Creature endued with Understanding
and Will, should acknowledge that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon his Maker, by a free act
of Choice, which other Creatures have
upon him, only by Necessity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
            <p>But still, there is one Objection more
against our foregoing Assertion, <hi>viz. That
Prayer obtains the things prayed for, only
as a Condition, and not by way of Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
or Perswasion;</hi> For is not Prayer
said to prevail by frequency, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 7.
and by Fervency, or Earnestness, in <hi>Iames</hi>
5. v. 16. and is not this a fair proof
that God is importuned and perswaded
into a Grant of our petitions?</p>
            <p>To this I answer two Things: 1. That
wheresoever God is said to answer Prayers,
either for their <hi>Frequency</hi> or <hi>Fervency,</hi> it
is spoken of him only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107166:71"/>
to the manner of Men; and,
consequently, ought to be understood
only of the <hi>effect</hi> or issue of such Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
in the success certainly attending
them, and not of the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,</hi>
that it is by <hi>perswading,</hi> or
working upon the Passions: As if we
should say, frequent, fervent, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
Prayers, are as certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with God's grant of the Thing
prayed for, as Men use to grant that,
which being overcome by excessive Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and Perswasion, they cannot
find in their hearts to deny. 2<hi>ly.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
further; That frequency and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
of Prayer prove effectual, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
of God the Things prayed for,
upon no other account, but as they are
Acts of <hi>Dependance</hi> upon God: which
Dependance we have already proved
to be that Thing essentially included in
Prayer, for which God has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to make Prayer the Condition, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he determines to grant Men
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107166:72"/>
such things as they need, and duly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to him for. So that still there is
nothing of <hi>Perswasion</hi> in the case.</p>
            <p>And thus having shewn (and I hope
fully and clearly) how <hi>Prayer</hi> operates
towards the obtaining of the Divine
Blessings; namely, as a <hi>Condition</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God for that purpose, and
no otherwise: And withall, for what
Reason it is singled out of all other
Acts of a Rational Nature, to be this
<hi>Condition;</hi> namely, because it is the
grand Instance of such a Nature's <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance</hi>
upon God. We shall now
from the same principle inferr also, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what account the highest Reverence
of God is so indispensably required of
us in Prayer, and all sort of Irreverence
so diametrically opposite to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of, the very Nature of it. And
it will appear, to be upon this, Tha<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in what degree any one lays aside his
Reverence of God, in the same he also
quits his <hi>Dependance</hi> upon Him: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107166:72"/>
as in every Irreverent Act, a
Man treats God, as if he had indeed no
need of Him, and behaves himself, as
if he stood upon his own bottom, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and Self-sufficient. This is the
natural Language, the true Signification
and Import of all Irreverence.</p>
            <p>Now in all Addresses, either to God
or Man, by Speech, our Reverence to
them must consist of, and shew it self
in, these Two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> A carefull Regulation of our
Thoughts, that are to dictate, and to
govern our Words; which is done by
Premeditation: And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> a due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of our Words, that are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from, and to express our Thoughts;
which is done by pertinence, and brevity
of Expression.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> directing his Prayer to God,
joyns these two together, as the two
great, integral parts of it; in <hi>Psalm</hi> 19.
14. <hi>Let the Words of my Mouth, and the
Meditations of my Heart, be acceptable in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107166:73"/>
thy sight, O Lord.</hi> So that, it seems, his
Prayer adequately and entirely consisted
of those Two things, <hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi>
as it were, the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi>
of that noble Composure. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no mention at all of Distortion of
Face, sanctified Grimace, solemn Wink,
or foaming at the Mouth, and the like;
all which are Circumstances of Prayer
of a later date, and brought into request
by those fantastick Zealots, who had a
way of praying, as astonishing to the
<hi>Eyes,</hi> as to the <hi>Ears</hi> of those that heard
them. Well then; the first Ingredient
of a pious, and reverential Prayer, is a
previous regulation of the Thoughts, as
the Text expresses it most emphatically;
<hi>Let not thy Heart be hasty to utter any
thing before God;</hi> that is, in other words.
Let it not venture to throw out its
crude, extemporary, suddain and misha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Conceptions in the face of Infinite
Perfection. Let not thy Heart <hi>conceive,</hi>
and <hi>bring forth</hi> together. This is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107166:73"/>
and unnatural. All Abortion is
from Infirmity and Defect. And time
is required to form the Issue of the Mind,
as well as that of the Body. The fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or unfitness of the first Thoughts,
cannot be judged of, but by reflexion
of the second: And be the Invention
never so fruitfull, yet in the Mind, as
in the Earth, that which is cast into it,
must lie hid and covered for a while,
before it can be fit to shoot forth.
These are the Methods of Nature, and
it is seldom but the Acts of Religion
conform to them.</p>
            <p>He who is to pray, would he seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<hi>judge</hi> of the Work that is before
him, has more to consider of, than, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Heart can hold, or his Head
well turn it self to. <hi>Prayer</hi> is one of
the greatest, and the hardest Works,
that a man has to doe in this World;
and was ever any thing difficult, or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
atchieved by a suddain Cast of a
Thought? a flying Stricture of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107166:74"/>
               <hi>Presence</hi> of Mind is indeed
good, but <hi>Hast</hi> is not so. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let this be concluded upon, That
in the Business of Prayer, to pretend to
Reverence, when there is no Premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
is both Impudence and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>Now this Premeditation ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
these three Things: 1. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
whom we pray to. 2. The <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of our Prayers; And, 3<hi>ly.</hi> The <hi>Order</hi>
and <hi>Disposition</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>1. And first, for the <hi>Person whom we
pray to.</hi> The same is to imploy, who
must needs also non-plus and astonish
thy Meditations, and be made the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of thy Thoughts, who infinitely
transcends them. For all the knowing
and reasoning Faculties of the Soul, are
utterly baffled, and at a loss, when they
offer at any Idea of the great God.
Nevertheless, since it is hard, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
to imprint an Awe upon the
Affections, without sutable Notions first
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107166:74"/>
formed in the Apprehensions. We must
in our Prayers, endeavour at least, to
bring these as near to God, as we can,
by considering such of his Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
as have, by their Effects, in a
great measure, manifested themselves to
our Senses, and, in a much greater, to
the Discourses of our Reason.</p>
            <p>As first; Consider with thy self, how
great and glorious a Being that must
needs be, that raised so vast and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
a Fabrick, as this of the World,
out of Nothing, with the breath of his
Mouth, and can and will, with the same,
reduce it to Nothing again; and then
consider, that this is that high, amazing,
incomprehensible Being, whom thou ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressest
thy pitifull Self to in Prayer.</p>
            <p>Consider next, his Infinite, All-search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Knowledge, which looks through
and through the most secret of our
Thoughts, ransacks every corner of the
Heart, ponders the most inward designs
and ends of the Soul in all a man's
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107166:75"/>
Actions. And then consider, That this
is the God, whom thou hast to deal with
in Prayer; the God, who observes the
postures, the frame and motion of thy
Mind, in all thy Approaches to Him;
and whose piercing Eye it is impossible
to elude, or escape, by all the tricks,
and arts, of the subtillest, and most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
Hypocrisy. And lastly, Consider
the great, the fiery, and the implacable
Jealousy, that he has for his Honour;
and that he has no other use of the whole
Creation, but to serve the Ends of it:
And above all, that he will, in a most
peculiar manner, <hi>be honoured of those who
draw near to him;</hi> and will by no means
suffer himself to be mockt and affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
under a pretence of being worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
nor endure, that a wretched, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
sinfull Creature, who is but
a piece of living Dirt at best, should
at the same time <hi>bend the Knee to him,
and spit in his face.</hi> And now consider,
that this is the God, whom thou prayest
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107166:75"/>
to; and whom thou usest with such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
Indignity, in every unworthy
Prayer, thou puttest up to Him; every
bold, sawcy, and familiar Word, that
(upon confidence of being one of <hi>God's
Elect</hi>) thou presumest to debase so great
a Majesty with: And for an Instance
of the dreadfull Curse, that attends such
a daring Irreverence, consider how God
used <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> for venturing to
offer <hi>strange Fire before him;</hi> and then
know, that every unhallowed, unfitting
Prayer, is a <hi>strange Fire:</hi> A Fire, that
will be sure to destroy the <hi>Offering,</hi>
though Mercy should spare the <hi>Offerer.</hi>
Consider these things seriously, deeply,
and severely, till the Consideration of
them affects thy Heart, and humbles
thy Spirit, with such awefull Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of thy Maker, and such abject Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon thy self, as may lay thee
in the Dust before Him: And know,
that the lower thou fallest, the higher
will thy Prayer rebound: And that thou
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107166:76"/>
art never so fit to pray to God, as when
a sense of thy own unworthiness makes
thee ashamed even to speak to Him.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> The second Object of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation,
<hi>is the Matter of our Prayers.</hi>
For, as we are to consider, <hi>whom we are
to pray to;</hi> so are we to consider also,
<hi>what we are to pray for;</hi> and this requires
no ordinary Application of Thought,
to distinguish, or judge of. Men's pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are generally dictated by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and their Desires are the Issues of
their Affections; and their Affections
are, for the most part, influenced by
their Corruptions. The first constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
principle of a well-conceived Prayer,
is to know, <hi>What not to pray for:</hi> which
the Scripture assures us, that some doe
not, while they <hi>pray for what they may
spend upon their Lusts,</hi> James 4. 3. Ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such things, as it is a Contumely
to God to hear, and Damnation to
themselves to receive. No Man is to
pray for any thing, either sinfull, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107166:76"/>
tending to Sin. No Man is to
pray for a <hi>Temptation,</hi> and much less
to desire God to be his <hi>Tempter;</hi> which
he would certainly be, should he, at the
instance of any Man's prayer, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
fuel to his sinfull or absurd Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.
Nor is any one to ask of God
things mean and trivial, and beneath
the Majesty of Heaven, to be concerned
about, or solemnly addressed to for.
Nor, lastly, is any one to admit into
his Petitions things superfluous, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant;
such as Wealth, Greatness,
and Honour. Which we are so far
from being warranted to beg of God,
that we are to beg his Grace to despise
and undervalue them; and it were
much, if the same things should be the
proper Objects both of our Self-denial,
and of our Prayers too; and that we
should be allowed to sollicit the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and enjoyned to endeavour
the mortification of the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:107166:77"/>
The Things that we are to pray for,
are either, 1<hi>st.</hi> Things of <hi>absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;</hi>
or, 2<hi>ly.</hi> Things of <hi>unquestionable
Charity. Of the first sort,</hi> are all spiritual
Graces required in us, as the indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
Conditions of our Salvation: Such
as are, <hi>Repentance, Faith, Hope, Charity,
Temperance,</hi> and all other Vertues, that
are either the parts, or principles, of a
pious Life. These are to be the prime
subject matter of our Prayers; and we
shall find, that nothing comes this way
so easily from Heaven, as those things
that will assuredly bring us to it. The
Spirit dictates all such Petitions, and
God himself is first the Author, and then
the Fulfiller of them; owning and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
them, both as our Duty, and
his own Production. <hi>The other sort of
things,</hi>
that may allowably be prayed
for, are things of manifest, unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Charity: Such as are a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
measure of the innocent Comforts
of Life, as Health, Peace, Maintenance,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107166:77"/>
and a Success of our honest Labours:
And yet, even these but Conditionally,
and with perfect Resignation to the Will
and Wisdom of the Soveraign Disposer
of all that belongs to us; Who (if he
finds it more for his Honour, to have
us serve him with sick, crazy, languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bodies, with poverty, and extreme
want of all things; and lastly, with our
Country all in a Flame about our Ears)
ought in all this, and much more, to
over-rule our Prayers, and Desires, into
an absolute Acquiescence in his All-wise
disposal of things; and to convince us,
that our Prayers are sometimes best an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
when our Desires are most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
            <p>In fine, to state the whole matter of
our Prayers in one word. Nothing can
be fit for us to pray for, but what is
fit and honourable for our great Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
and <hi>Master of Requests, Iesus Christ</hi>
himself, to intercede for. This is to be the
unchangeable Rule and Measure of all
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107166:78"/>
our Petitions. And then, if Christ is to
convey these our Petitions to his Father,
can any one dare to make him who
was Holiness and Purity it self, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
and Sollicitor for his Lusts? Him
who was nothing but Meekness, Lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Humility, his Providetore for
such things as can only feed his Pride,
and flush his Ambition? No certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
when we come as Suppliants to the
Throne of Grace, where Christ sits as
Intercessor at God's right hand, nothing
can be fit to proceed out of our Mouth,
but what is fit to pass through His.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> The <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> Thinng, that
calls for a previous Meditation to our
Prayers, is the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Disposition</hi> of
them. For though God does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
us to set off our Prayers with
Dress, and Artifice, to flourish it in
Trope and Metaphor, to beg our daily
Bread in blank Verse, or to shew any
thing of the <hi>Poet</hi> in our Devotions, but
<hi>Indigence</hi> and <hi>Want;</hi> I say, though
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107166:78"/>
God is far from requiring such things of
us in our Prayers, yet he requires that
we should manage them with Sense and
Reason. Fineness is not expected, but
Decency is; and though we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
as Orators, yet he will have us
speak like Men, and tender him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
of that Understanding and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that essentially constitute a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Nature.</p>
            <p>But I shall briefly cast what I have
to say upon this particular, into these
following Assertions.</p>
            <p>1. That nothing can express our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to God in Prayer, that would
pass for Irreverence towards a Great
Man. Let any Subject tender his Prince
a Petition, fraught with Nonsense and
Incoherence, Confusion and Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence;
and can he expect that Majesty
should answer it with any thing but a
deaf Ear, a frowning Eye, (or, at best)
vouchsafe it in any other Reward, but
by a gracious Oblivion to forgive the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107166:79"/>
person, and to forget the petition?</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> Nothing Absurd and Irrational,
and such as a Wise man would despise,
can be acceptable to God in Prayer.
<hi>Solomon</hi> expressly tells us in <hi>Ecclesiastes 5.
v.</hi> 4. that <hi>God has no pleasure in Fools;</hi>
nor is it possible that an Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
should. The Scripture all along
expresses <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi> by the Name
of <hi>Folly:</hi> And therefore, certainly Folly
is too near of kin to it, to find any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
from God in so great a Duty:
it is the simplicity of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and not
of the <hi>Head,</hi> that is the best Enditer of
our Petitions. That which proceeds from
the latter, is undoubtedly the <hi>sacrifice of
fools;</hi> and God is never more weary of
<hi>Sacrifice,</hi> than when a Fool is the Priest,
and Folly the Oblation.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> Nothing rude, slight,
and careless; or, indeed, less than the very
best that a man can offer, can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
or pleasing, to God in Prayer.
<hi>If ye offer the Blind for sacrifice, is it not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107166:79"/>
Evil? If ye offer the Lame, and the Sick,
is it not Evil? Offer it now to thy Governour,
and see whether he will be pleased with thee,
or accept thy Person, saith the Lord of Hosts?
Malachi</hi> 1. 8. God rigidly expects a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of his own Gifts; and where he
has given ability, will be served by Acts
proportionable to it. And he who has
parts to raise, and propagate his own
Honour by, but none to imploy in the
Worship of him, that gave them, does
(as I may so express it) refuse to wear
God's Livery in his own Service, adds
Sacrilege to Prophaneness, strips and
starves his Devotions, and (in a word)
falls directly under the Dint of that
Curse, denounced in the last Verse of
the 1<hi>st.</hi> of <hi>Malachi, Cursed be the Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that hath in his Flock a Male, and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and sacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt
thing.</hi> The same is here, both the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
and the Deceived too; for God
very well knows <hi>what</hi> he gives Men, and
<hi>why;</hi> And where he has bestwoed Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107166:80"/>
Learning, and Utterance, will not
endure that Men should be accurate in
their Discourse, and loose in their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
or think, that the great <hi>Author of
every good and perfect Gift,</hi> will be put
off with Ramble, and confused Talk,
Babble, and Tautology.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the <hi>Order</hi> and
Disposition of our Prayers, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
requires precedent Thought and
Meditation. God has declared himself
the <hi>God of Order</hi> in all things; and will
have it observed, in what he commands
others, as well as in what he does him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<hi>Order</hi> is the great Rule, or Art,
by which God made the World, and by
which he still governs it: Nay, the
World it self is nothing else; and all
this glorious System of things, is but the
Chaos put into order: And how then
can God, who has so eminently owned
himself concerned for this excellent
thing, brook such Absurdity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
as the slovenly and profane Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107166:80"/>
of some treats him with, in their
most solemn Addresses to him? All
which is the natural, unavoidable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of Unpreparedness, and want of
Premeditation; without which, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
presumes to pray, cannot be so
properly said to <hi>approach</hi> to, as to
<hi>break</hi> in upon God. And surely, he
who is so hardy, as to do so, has no
reason in the Earth to expect that the
success, which follows his prayers, should
be greater than the preparation, that
goes before them.</p>
            <p>Now from what has been hitherto
discoursed of this first and grand Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of a pious and devout Prayer,
to wit, <hi>Premeditation of Thought,</hi> what
can be so naturally, and so usefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd,
as the high Expediency, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the absolute Necessity of a Set-form
of Prayer, to guide our Devotions by?
We have lived in an Age that has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
contradicted, and counter-acted
all the principles and practices of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107166:81"/>
Primitive Christians, in taking the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of their Duty both to God and
Man, and of their Behaviour both in
matters Civil and Religious; but in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more scandalously, than in their
vile abuse of the great Duty of Prayer;
concerning which, though it may with
the clearest truth be affirmed, That there
has been no Church yet of any account
in the Christian World, but what has go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
its publick Worship of God by a
Liturgy, or Set-form of Prayer; yet
these enthusiastick Innovators, the bold
and blind Reformers of all Antiquity,
and <hi>wiser</hi> than the whole Catholick
Church besides, introduced into the
room of it, a sawcy, senceless, Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
way of speaking to God; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,
that this was a <hi>Praying by the
Spirit;</hi>
and that the Use of all Set-forms
was <hi>stinting of the Spirit.</hi> A pretence,
I confess, popular, and plausible enough,
with such Idiots, as take the Sound of
Words, for the Sence of them. But,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107166:81"/>
for the full Confutation of it, (which, I
hope, shall be done both easily and
briefly too) I shall advance this one As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
in direct Contradiction to that;
Namely,</p>
            <p>That the Praying by a Set-form, is not
a stinting of the Spirit; and the Praying
extempore truly and properly is so.</p>
            <p>For the proving and making out of
which, we will first consider, <hi>What it is
to Pray by the Spirit.</hi> A thing much
talkt of, but not so convenient for the
talkers of it, and pretenders to it, to
have it rightly stated and understood.
In short, it includes in it these two
Things:</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> A praying with the Heart, which
is sometimes called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Inward
man;</hi> and so it is properly opposed to
Hypocritical Lip-devotions, in which
the <hi>Heart</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> does not go along
with a man's Words.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> It includes in it also a praying
according to the Rules prescribed by
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107166:82"/>
God's <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and held forth to us
in his Revealed Word, which Word
was both Dictated and Confirmed by
this Spirit: And so it is opposed to the
praying unlawfully, or unwarrantably;
and that, either in respect of the Matter,
or Manner of our Prayers. As, when
we desire of God such things, or in such
a way, <hi>as the Spirit of God,</hi> speaking in
his Holy Word, does by no means war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
or approve of. So that to <hi>Pray
by the Spirit,</hi> signifies neither more nor
less, but to pray knowingly, heartily,
and affectionately, for such things, and
in such a manner, as the Holy Ghost,
in Scripture, either commands or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
of. As for any other kind of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Spirit,</hi> upon the best enquiry
that I can make into these matters, I
can find none. And if some say as (I
know they both impudently and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously
doe) that, <hi>to pray by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
is to have the Spirit immediately
inspiring them, and by such Inspiration
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107166:82"/>
speaking within them, and so dictating
their prayers to them, let them either
produce plain Scripture, or doe a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to prove this by. But till then,
he who shall consider, what kind of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
these pretenders to <hi>the Spirit</hi> have
been notable for, will find, that they
have as little Cause to father their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
as their Practices, upon the Spirit
of God.</p>
            <p>These Two things are certain, and
I doe particularly recommend them to
your Observation. One, that this way
of <hi>Praying by the Spirit</hi> (as they call it)
was begun, and first brought into use
here in <hi>England,</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days,
by a <hi>Popish</hi> Priest and <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryar,
one <hi>Faithfull Commin</hi> by Name; who
counterfeiting himself a Protestant, and
a Zealot of the highest form, set up this
new Spiritual way of Praying, with a
design to bring the People first to a
Contempt, and from thence to an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Hatred and Disuse of our <hi>Common-prayer;</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:107166:83"/>
which he still reviled as only a
Translation of the Mass; thereby to
distract men's Minds, and to divide our
Church. And this he did with such
success, that we have lived to see the
Effects of his Labours in the utter sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Church and State. Which
hellish Negotiation, when this malicious
Hypocrite came to <hi>Rome</hi> to give the
Pope an account of, he received of him
(as so notable a service well deserved)
besides a <hi>thousand</hi> Thanks, <hi>two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi>
Ducats for his pains. So that now
you see here the Original of this Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore-way
of praying by the Spirit. The
other thing that I would observe to you,
is, That in the neighbour Nation of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> one of the greatest
<note n="*" place="margin">Major <hi>Iohn Weyer:</hi> see <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villac Rediviv.</hi>
               </note> Monsters of Men, that, I
believe, ever lived, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in league with the Devil; was
yet, by the confession of all that heard
him, the most Excellent at this Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore-way
of <hi>Praying by the Spirit,</hi> of any
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107166:83"/>
Man in his time; none was able to come
near him, or to compare with him.
But surely now, he who shall venture
to ascribe the Prayers of such a Wretch,
made up of Adulteries, Incest, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
and other Villainies, not to be
named, to the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> may as
well strike in with the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the Miracles of Christ to the Devil.
And thus having shewn, both what ought
to be meant by <hi>Praying by the Spirit,</hi> and
what ought not, cannot be meant by
it; let us now see whether a <hi>Set-form,</hi> or
this <hi>Extemporary-way,</hi> be the greater hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
and stinter of it: In order to which,
I shall lay down these three Assertions.</p>
            <p>1. That the Soul, or Mind of Man,
is but of a limited Nature in all its Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and consequently, cannot supply
two distinct Faculties, at the same time,
to the same height of Operation.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> That the finding Words and
Expressions for Prayer, is the proper
business of the Brain and the Invention;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107166:84"/>
and, that the finding Devotion and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to accompany, and go along
with those Expressions, is properly the
Work, and Business of the Heart.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> That this Devotion, and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is indispensably required in <hi>Prayer,</hi>
as the principal and most Essential part
of it, and that in which the Spirituality
of it does most properly consist.</p>
            <p>Now from these three Things put
together, this must naturally and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
follow; That as, <hi>Spiritual Prayer,</hi>
or <hi>Praying by the Spirit,</hi> taken in the
right sense of the word, consists proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that Affection, and Devotion, that
the Heart exercises and imploys in the
Work of Prayer; so, whatsoever gives
the Soul scope and liberty to exercise
and imploy this Affection and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that does most effectually help and
enlarge the Spirit of Prayer; and, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
diverts the Soul from employing
such Affection and Devotion, that does
most directly stint and hinder it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107166:84"/>
let this now be our Rule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to judge of the Efficacy of a <hi>Set-form,</hi>
and of the <hi>Extempore-way,</hi> in the present
Business. As for a Set-form, in which
the Words are ready prepared to our
hands, the Soul has nothing to doe, but
to attend to the work of raising the
Affections and Devotions, to go along
with those words; So that all the
Powers of the Soul are took up in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the <hi>Heart</hi> to this great Duty;
and it is the Exercise of the <hi>Heart</hi> (as
has been already shewn) that is truly
and properly <hi>a Praying by the Spirit.</hi> On
the contrary, in all Extempore-prayer,
the Powers and Faculties of the Soul are
called off from dealing with the <hi>Heart,</hi>
and the Affections; and that both in
the Speaker, and in the Hearer; both
in him who makes, and in him who is
to joyn in such Prayers.</p>
            <p>And first for the Minister, who makes
and utters such Extempore-prayers. He
is wholly imploying his Inventions,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107166:85"/>
both to conceive Matter, and to find
Words and Expressions to cloath it in:
This is certainly the work, which takes
up his <hi>Mind,</hi> in this Exercise: And since
the Nature of man's Mind is such, that
it cannot with the same vigour, at the
same time, attend the work of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that of raising the Affections
also; nor measure out the same supply
of Spirits and Intention for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Operations of the <hi>Head,</hi> and
those of the <hi>Heart</hi> too; it is certain,
that while the Head is so much imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Heart must be idle, and very
little imployed; and perhaps not at all:
And consequently, if, <hi>to pray by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
be to pray with the Heart, and the
Affections; it is also as certain, that
while a Man prays <hi>Extempore,</hi> he does
<hi>not pray by the Spirit:</hi> Nay, the very
truth of it is, that while he is so doing,
he is not <hi>praying</hi> at all, but he is <hi>study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
He is beating his <hi>Brain,</hi> while he
should be drawing out his <hi>Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:107166:85"/>
And then for the People, that are to
hear, and joyn with him in such Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
it is manifest, that they not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before-hand, what the Minister will
say, must, as soon as they do hear him,
presently busy and bestirr their Minds,
both to apprehend and understand the
meaning of what they hear; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
to judge, whether it be of such a
Nature, as to be fit for them, to joyn
and concur with him <hi>in.</hi> So that the
People also, are, by this Course, put to
<hi>study,</hi> and to imploy their apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and judging Faculties, while they
should be exerting their Affections, and
Devotions; and consequently, by this
means, the <hi>Spirit of Prayer is stinted,</hi> as
well in the Congregation, that follows,
as in the Minister, who first conceives
a Prayer after their Extempore-way.
Which is a Truth so clear, and indeed
self-evident, that it is impossible, that it
should need any further Arguments to
demonstrate, or make it out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:107166:86"/>
The Sum of all is this; That since a
Set-form of Prayer leaves the Soul wholly
free, to imploy its Affections and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
in which <hi>the Spirit of Prayer</hi>
does most properly consist; it follows,
that <hi>the Spirit of Prayer</hi> is thereby, in a
singular manner, helped, promoted, and
enlarged: And since, on the other hand,
the Extempore-way withdraws and takes
off the Soul from imploying its <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and engages it chiefly, if not wholly,
about the use of its Invention; it as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follows, that the <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi> is,
by this means, unavoidably cramp'd
and hindred, and (to use their own
word) <hi>stinted:</hi> Which was the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that I undertook to prove. But
there are two Things, I confess, that
are extreamly <hi>hindred</hi> and <hi>stinted</hi> by a
Set-form of Prayer, and equally <hi>further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
and <hi>enlarged</hi> by the Extempore-way;
which, without all doubt, is the true
Cause, why the former is so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried,
and the latter so much extolled
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107166:86"/>
by the Men, whom we are now plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with. The first of which is <hi>Pride</hi>
and <hi>Ostentation;</hi> the other <hi>Faction</hi> and
<hi>Sedition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. And first for <hi>Pride.</hi> I do not in
the least question, but the chief Designs
of such as use the Extempore-way, is to
amuse <hi>the unthinking Rabble</hi> with an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of their Gifts; their whole
Devotion proceeding from no other
principle, but only a <hi>Love to hear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
talk.</hi> And, I believe, it would put
<hi>Lucifer</hi> himself hard to it, to out-vye the
Pride of one of those fellows pouring
out his Extempore-stuff amongst his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
whining, factious Followers,
listning to, and applauding his copious
Flow and Cant, with the ridiculous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
of their impertinent Groans. And,
the truth is, Extempore-prayer, even
when best and most dextrously perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is nothing else, but a business of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
and Wit (such as it is) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
no more to it, but a teeming Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107166:87"/>
a bold Front, and a ready
Expression; and deserves much the same
Commendation (were it not in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
too <hi>serious,</hi> to be <hi>suddain</hi> upon) which
is due to <hi>Extempore</hi> Verses: only with
this difference, That there is necessary
to these latter a competent measure of
Wit and Learning; whereas the former
may be done with very little Wit, and
no Learning at all.</p>
            <p>And now, can any sober person think
it reasonable, that the publick Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a whole Congregation, should
be under the Conduct, and at the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a pert, empty, conceited <hi>Holder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,</hi>
whose chief (if not sole) intent is
to Vaunt his spiritual Clack, and (as I
may so speak) to <hi>pray Prizes;</hi> whereas
Prayer is a Duty, that recommends it
self to the Acceptance of Almighty God,
by no other Qualification so much, as
by the profoundest Humility, and the
lowest Esteem that a man can possibly
have of himself?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:107166:87"/>
Certainly the Extemporizing faculty
is never more out of its Element, than
in the Pulpit: Though even here, it is
much more excusable in a Sermon, than
in a Prayer; For as much as in that, a
Man addresses himself but to Men; Men
like himself, whom he may therefore
make bold with; as, no doubt, for so
doing they will also make bold with
him. Besides, the peculiar advantage
attending all such suddain Conceptions,
that, as they are quickly Born, so they
quickly Die: It being seldom known,
where the Speaker has so very <hi>fluent</hi> an
<hi>Invention,</hi> but the Hearer also has the
Gift of as <hi>fluent</hi> a <hi>Memory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> The other thing that has been
hitherto so little befriended by a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and so very much by
the Extempore-way, is <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
It has been always found an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way of girding at the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Scripture-phrase.</hi> And we all
know the Common Dialect, in which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107166:88"/>
the great Masters of this Art used to
pray for the King, and which may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pass for only a cleanlier and more
refined kind of Libelling him in <hi>the Lord.
As that God would turn his Heart, and open
his Eyes:</hi> As if he were a <hi>Pagan,</hi> yet to
be converted to Christianity; with many
other sly, virulent, and malicious Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
which we may every day hear
of from (those Mints of Treason and
Rebellion) their Conventicles; and for
which, and a great deal less, some
Princes and Governments would make
them not only eat their Words, but the
Tongue that spoke them too. In fine,
let all their Extempore Harangues be
considered, and duly weighed, and you
shall find a <hi>Spirit</hi> of Pride, Faction, and
Sedition, predominant in them all: The
only <hi>Spirit,</hi> which those Impostors do
really, and indeed, <hi>pray by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been so much the longer, and
the earnester, against this intoxicating,
bewitching Cheat of Extempore-prayer,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107166:88"/>
being fully satisfied in my Conscience,
that it has been all along the Devil's
Master-piece and prime Engine to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
our Church by. For I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this as a most unanswerable Truth,
That whatsoever renders the publick
Worship of God contemptible amongst
us, must, in the same degree, weaken and
discredit our whole Religion. And, I
hope, I have also proved it to be a Truth
altogether as clear, That this Extempore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
naturally brings all the Contempt
upon the Worship of God, that both
the <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> of Men can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
expose it to: And, therefore, as a
thing neither subservient to the true Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of Religion, nor grounded upon
Principles of Reason, nor, lastly, sutable
to the Practice of Antiquity, ought, by
all means, to be exploded and cast out
of every sober and well-ordered Church;
or that will be sure to throw the Church
it self out of Doors.</p>
            <p>And thus I have at length finished
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107166:89"/>
what I had to say of the first Ingredient
of a Pious and Reverential Prayer, which
was <hi>Premeditation of Thought,</hi> prescribed
to us in these words, <hi>Let not thy mouth
be rash, nor thy heart be hasty to utter any
thing before God.</hi> Which excellent Words,
and most wise Advice of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
can reconcile to the Expediency,
Decency, or Usefulness of Extempore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer,
I shall acknowledge him a Man
of greater Ability and Parts of Mind,
than <hi>Solomon</hi> Himself.</p>
            <p>The other Ingredient of a Reverential
and duly qualified Prayer, is <hi>a pertinent
Brevity of Expression,</hi> mentioned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
in that part of the Text;
<hi>Therefore let thy Words be few.</hi> But this I
cannot dispatch now, and therefore shall
not enter upon at this time.</p>
            <p>Now to God the Father, God the Son, and
God the Holy Ghost, Three Persons and
One God, be rendred and ascribed, as is
most due, all Praise, Might, Majesty and
Dominion, both now and for evermore.
<hi>Amen.</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ECCLES. V. 2.</bibl>
               <q>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not
thine heart be hasty to utter any thing
before God: for God is in Heaven, and
thou upon Earth; therefore let thy
words be few.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Formerly began a Discourse upon
these Words, and observed in them
these three Things:</p>
            <p>1. That whosoever appears in the
House of God, and particularly in the
way of Prayer, ought to reckon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in a more especial manner, placed
in the sight and presence of God: And,</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> That the vast and infinite Distance
between God and Him, ought to create
in him all imaginable Awe and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in such his Addresses to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:107166:91"/>
3<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly;</hi> That this Reverence
required of him, is to consist in a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
preparation of his Thoughts, and a
sober government of his Expressions:
Neither is his <hi>mouth to be rash, nor his
heart to be hasty in uttering any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These three Things I shew, were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
contained in the Words, and did
as evidently contain the whole Sense of
them. But I gathered them all into this
one Proposition; Namely,</p>
            <p>That Premeditation of Thought, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of Expression, are the great Ingredients
of that Reverence, that is required to a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
acceptable, and devout Prayer.</p>
            <p>The first of these, which is <hi>Premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Thought,</hi> I then fully treated of,
and dispatched; and shall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the other, which is a <hi>pertinent
Brevity of Expression; Therefore let thy
words be few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning which, we shall observe,
first in General, That to be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107166:91"/>
our Minds briefly, and fully too,
is absolutely the greatest Perfection and
Commendation that Speech is capable
of; such a mutual Communication of
our Thoughts, being (as I may so speak)
the next approach to <hi>Intuition;</hi> and the
nearest Imitation of the Converse of
blessed <hi>Spirits made perfect,</hi> that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in this World can possibly raise
us to. Certainly the greatest and the
wisest Conceptions, that ever issued from
the Mind of Man, have been couched
under, and delivered in a few, close,
home, and significant Words.</p>
            <p>But to derive the Credit of this way
of speaking much higher, and from an
Example infinitely greater, than the
greatest humane Wisdom, was it not
authorized, and ennobled by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his making of the World? Was
not the Work, of all the six days, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
in so many Words? There was
no Circumlocution, or Amplification,
in the Case; which makes the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rician
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107166:92"/>
               <hi>Longinus,</hi> in his Book <hi>of the Lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Speech,</hi> so much admire the
Height and Grandeur of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Style
in his first Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
The
Law-giver of the <hi>Iews</hi> (says he, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Moses</hi>) was no ordinary Man,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, because (says he) he set
forth the Divine Power sutably to the
Majesty and Greatness of it. But how
did he this? Why, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
&amp;c. For
that (<hi>says he</hi>) in the very Entrance of
his Laws, he gives us this short and
present Account of the whole Creation:
God said, <hi>Let there be Light, and there
was Light; Let there be an Earth, a Sea,
and a Firmament, and there was so.</hi> So
that all this high Elogy and Encomium,
given by this Heathen of <hi>Moses,</hi> sprang
only from the Majestick Brevity of this
one Expression; an Expression so suted
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107166:92"/>
to the Greatness of a Creator, and so
Expressive of his boundless, creative
Power, as a Power infinitely above all
Controll, or possibility of finding the
least obstacle or delay, in atchieving its
mightiest, and most stupendious Works.
Heaven, and Earth, and all the Host of
both (as it were) dropt from his Mouth;
and Nature it self was but the product
of a Word; a Word, not designed to
Express, but to Constitute and give a
Being; and not so much the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as the Cause of what it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>This was God's way of speaking in
his first forming of the Universe: And
was it not so, in the next grand Instance
of his Power, his Governing of it too?
For are not the great Instruments of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
his Laws, drawn up and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
into a few Sentences? the whole
Body of them containing but Ten
Commandments, and some of those
Commandments, not so many words?
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107166:93"/>
Nay, and have we not these also brought
into yet a narrower Compass by him,
who best understood them? <hi>Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart,
and with all thy Soul, and thy Neighbour
as thy self.</hi> Precepts, nothing like the
Tedious, Endless, Confused Trash of
Humane Laws; Laws so numerous,
that they not only exceed men's Practice,
but also surpass their Arithmetick; and
so voluminous, that no mortal Head,
nor Shoulders neither, must ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
themselves able to <hi>bear</hi> them. In
God's Laws the Words are few, the
Sense vast, and infinite. In Humane
Laws, you shall be sure to have Words
enough; but, for the most part, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Sense and Reason of them, you
had need read them with a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope.</p>
            <p>And thus having shewn, how the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
utters himself, when he speaks,
and that upon the greatest Occasions;
let us now descend from Heaven to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107166:93"/>
Earth, from God to Man, and shew,
That it is no presumption for us to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our Words, as well as our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to the supreme Pattern, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our poor measures to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Wisdom that we adore. And
for this, has it not been noted by the
best Observers, and the ablest Judges,
both of Things and Persons, that the
Wisdom of any People or Nation has
been most seen in the Proverbs and
short Sayings commonly received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them? And what is a Proverb,
but the Experience and Observation of
several Ages, gathered and summ'd up
into one Expression? The Scripture
vouches <hi>Solomon</hi> for the <hi>wisest of Men,</hi>
and they are his <hi>Proverbs</hi> that prove
him so. The Seven Wife men of <hi>Greece,</hi>
so famous for their Wisdom all the
World over, acquired all that Fame each
of them, by a single Sentence, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of two or three Words. And <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
still lives and flourishes in the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107166:94"/>
Mouths of all, while many vast Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
are extinct, and sunk into Dust,
and utter Oblivion. And then, for
Books; we shall generally find, that the
most Excellent, in any Art or Science,
have been still the smallest, and most
compendious: And this not without
ground; for it is an Argument that the
Author was a Master of what he wrote;
and had a clear Notion, and a full
Comprehension of the Subject before
him. For the <hi>Reason</hi> of Things lies in
a little compass, if the Mind could at
any time, be so happy as to light upon
it. Most of the Writings and Discourses
in the World, are but Illustration, and
Rhetorick, which signifies as much as
nothing to a Mind eager in pursuit after
the Causes and Philosophical Truth of
Things. It is the work of Fancy to
<hi>enlarge,</hi> but of Judgment to <hi>shorten</hi> and
<hi>contract;</hi> and therefore this must needs
be as far above the other, as Judgment
is a greater and a nobler Faculty than
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107166:94"/>
Fancy or Imagination. All Philosophy
is reduced to a few Principles, and those
Principles comprized in a few Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And as the whole Structure of
<hi>Speculation</hi> rests upon three or four Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms,
or Maxims; so that of Practice
also bears upon a very small number of
Rules. And surely, there was never yet
any <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Maxim</hi> that filled a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
or took up a Week's time to be
got by Heart. No; these are the <hi>Api<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Rerum,</hi> the Tops and Summs, the
very Spirit and Life of Things extracted
and abridged; just as all the Lines
drawn from the vastest Circumference,
doe at length meet and unite in the
smallest of things, a <hi>Point;</hi> and it is
but a very little piece of Wood, with
which a true Artist will measure all the
Timber in the World. The Truth is,
there could be no such thing as Art or
Science, could not the Mind of Man
gather the General Natures of Things
out of the numberless heap of Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107166:95"/>
and then bind them up into such
short Aphorisms or Propositions; that
so they may be made portable to the
Memory, and thereby become ready
and at hand, for the Judgment to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and make use of, as there shall be
occasion.</p>
            <p>In fine, Brevity, and Succinctness of
Speech, is that, which in Philosophy or
Speculation we call <hi>Maxim,</hi> and First
Principle; in the Counsels and Resolves
of Practical Wisdom, and the deep My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Religion, <hi>Oracle;</hi> and lastly,
in matters of Wit, and the finenesses of
Imagination, <hi>Epigram.</hi> All of them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally,
and in their kinds the greatest,
and the noblest things that the Mind of
Man can shew the force and dexterity
of its Faculties in.</p>
            <p>And now, if this be the highest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
and perfection of Speech, in
all other things, can we assign any true,
solid Reason, why it should not be so
likewise in Prayer? Nay, is there not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107166:95"/>
rather the clearest Reason imaginable,
why it should be much more so? Since
most of the fore-mentioned things are
but Addresses to an Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
which may need as many
Words as may fill a Volume, to make
it understand the Truth of one Line.
Whereas Prayer is an Address to that
Eternal Mind, which (as we have shewn
before) such as rationally Invocate,
pretend not to Inform. Nevertheless,
since the Nature of Man is such, that
while we are yet in the Body, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and Worship of God must of
Necessity proceed in some Analogy to
the Reverence, that we shew to the
Grandees of this World, we will here
see, what the judgment of all Wise
men is, concerning fewness of Words,
when we appear as Suppliants before
our Earthly Superiors; and we shall
find, that they generally allow it to
import these three Things: 1. <hi>Modesty.
2. Discretion;</hi> And 3<hi>ly.</hi> Height of <hi>Respect
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107166:96"/>
to the Person addressed to.</hi> And first, for
<hi>Modesty.</hi> Modesty is a kind of shame,
or bashfulness, proceeding from the
sense a Man has of his own defects,
compared with the Perfections of Him
whom he comes before. And that which
is Modesty towards Men, is Worship
and Devotion towards God. It is a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
that makes a Man unwilling to be
seen, and fearfull to be heard; and yet
for that very Cause, never fails to make
him, both seen with Favour, and heard
with Attention. It loves not many
words, nor indeed needs them. For
Modesty addressing to any one of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Worth and Honour, is sure to
have that man's Honour for its Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and his Generosity for its Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.
And how then is it possible for
such a Vertue to run out into Words!
Loquacity storms the Ear, but Modesty
takes the Heart; that is Troublesome,
this Gentle, but Irresistible. Much Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is always the Effect of Confidence;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107166:96"/>
and Confidence still pre-supposes, and
springs from the Perswasion that a Man
has of his own Worth: both of them,
certainly, very unfit Qualifications for a
Petitioner.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> The second Thing that natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shews it self in Paucity of Words, is
<hi>Discretion;</hi> and particularly, that prime
and eminent part of it, that consists in
a Care of offending: Which <hi>Solomon</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us, That in much Speaking, it is
hardly possible for us to avoid: in <hi>Prov.
10. 19. In the multitude of Words</hi> (says
He) <hi>there wanteth not sin.</hi> It requiring
no ordinary Skill for a Man to make
his Tongue run by Rule; and, at the
same time, to give it both its Lesson,
and its Liberty too. For seldom, or
never, is there much spoke, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
or other had better been not
spoke; there being nothing that the
Mind of Man is so apt to kindle, and
take distast at, as at Words: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
whensoever any one comes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107166:97"/>
a Suit to another, no doubt, the
fewer of them the better; since, where
so very little is said, it is sure to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Candidly <hi>accepted,</hi> or, which is next,
Easily <hi>excused:</hi> But, at the same time,
to Petition, and to Provoke too, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
very preposterous.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> The third Thing, that <hi>Brevity
of Speech</hi> commends it self by, in all Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titionary
Addresses, is a peculiar respect
to the Person addressed to: For, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Petitions his Superior, in such a
manner, does, by his very so doing,
confess him better able to understand,
than he himself can be to express his
own Case. He owns him, as a Patron,
of a preventing Judgment and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and, upon that account, able, not
only to Answer, but also to Anticipate
his Requests. For, according to the
most Natural Interpretation of Things,
this is to ascribe to him a Sagacity so
quick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and piercing, that it were Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
to inform; and a Benignit
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107166:97"/>
so great, that it were needless to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
him. And can there be a greater,
and more winning Deference to a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
than to treat him under such a
Character? Or, can any thing be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
so naturally fit and efficacious,
both to enforce the Petition, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear
the Petitioner? A short Petition
to a Great Man, is not only a Suit to
him for his Favour, but also a Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
upon his Parts.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given you the Three
Commendatory Qualifications of Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Speech, in our Applications to the
Great Ones of the World. Concerning
which, as I shewed before, That it was
Impossible for us to form our Addresses,
even to God himself, but with some
Proportion and Resemblance to those
that we make to our fellow Mortals, in
a Condition much above us; so it is
certain, That whatsoever the general
Judgment and Consent of Mankind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
to be Expressive and Declarative
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107166:98"/>
of our Honour to those, must (only with
due allowance of the Difference of the
Object) as really and properly declare
and signify that Honour and Adoration
that is due from us to the Great God.
And consequently, what we have said
for Brevity of Speech, with Respect to
the former, ought equally to conclude
for it, with Relation to him too.</p>
            <p>But to argue more immediately, and
directly to the Point before us. I shall
now produce five Arguments, enforcing
Brevity, and cashiering all Prolixity of
Speech, with peculiar Reference to our
Addresses to God.</p>
            <p>1. And the first Argument shall be
taken from this Consideration: <hi>That
there is no Reason alledgable for the Use of
Length, or Prolixity of Speech, that is at
all Applicable to Prayer.</hi> For, whosoever
uses Multiplicity of Words, or Length
of Discourse, must of necessity doe it
for one of these three Purposes; Either
to <hi>inform,</hi> or <hi>perswade;</hi> or, lastly, to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107166:98"/>
               <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>overcome</hi> the person, whom he
directs his Discourse to. But the very
first foundation, of what I had to say
upon this Subject, was laid by me, in
demonstrating, That Prayer could not
possibly prevail with God, any of these
three ways. For as much as being Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient,
he could not be Informed;
and, being void of Passion, or Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he could not be perswaded; and,
lastly, being Omnipotent, and infinitely
Great, he could not, by any Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
be wearied, or overcome. And, if
so, what use then can there be of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
Harangue, or Multitude of Words
in Prayer? For, if they should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for Information, must it not be
infinitely sottish, and unreasonable, to
go about to inform him, who can be
ignorant of Nothing? Or, to perswade
him, whose unchangeable Nature makes
it Impossible for him to be moved, or
wrought upon? Or, lastly, by long
and much speaking, to think to weary
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107166:99"/>
him out, whose Infinite Power, all the
strength of Men and Angels, and the
whole World put together, is not able
to encounter, or stand before? So that
the truth is, by Loquacity and Prolixity
of Prayer, a Man does really and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
(whether he thinks so or no) rob
God of the Honour of those three great
Attributes, and neither treats Him as a
person Omniscient, or Unchangeable, or
Omnipotent. For, on the other side,
all the usefulness of long Speech, in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Converse, is founded only upon
the Defects and Imperfections of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature. For he, whose Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is at best but limited, and whose
Intellect, both in apprehending and
judging, proceeds by a small diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Light, cannot but receive an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Light, by the Conceptions of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Man, clearly and plainly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and by such Expression conveyed
to his Apprehension. And He again,
whose Nature subjects him to Want and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107166:99"/>
Weakness, and consequently to Hopes
and Fears, cannot but be moved this
way, or that way, according as Objects
sutable to those Passions, shall be dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously
represented, and set before his
Imagination, by the Arts of Speaking;
which is that, that we call <hi>Perswasion.</hi>
And lastly, He, whose Soul and Body
receives their Activity from, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all their Functions by, the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirits, which ebb and flow,
consume, and are renewed again, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but find himself very uneasy upon
any tedious, verbose Application made
to him: and that sometimes to such a
degree, that through meer Fatigue, and
even against Judgment and Interest both,
a man shall surrender himself as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
person, to the over-bearing Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence
of such Sollicitations: For when
they ply him so fast, and pour in upon
him so thick, they cannot but wear, and
wast the Spirits, as unequal to so perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
a Charge; and this is properly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107166:100"/>
to weary a man. But now all Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we know, pre-supposes Weakness;
and consequently, every long, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
wearisome Petition, is truly and
properly a force upon him, that is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
with it, it is a following Blow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Blow upon the Mind and Affections,
and may, for the time, pass for a real,
though short, Persecution.</p>
            <p>This is the State and Condition of
Humane Nature; and Prolixity, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of Speech, is still the great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to attack it by, either in its <hi>blind</hi>
or <hi>weak</hi> side: And I think I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to affirm, That it is seldom, that
any man is prevailed upon by Words,
but upon a True and Philosophical e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimate
of the whole matter, he is either
<hi>deceived,</hi> or <hi>wearied,</hi> before he is so; and
parts with the thing desired of him upon
the very same terms, that either a Child
parts with a Jewel for an Apple, or a
Man parts with his Sword, when it is
forceably wrested, or took from him.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107166:100"/>
And that he who obtains, what he has
been Rhetorically, or Importunately
begging for, goes away really a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer,
and Triumphantly carrying off
the Spoils of his Neighbour's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
or his Will; baffling the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
or wearying the latter into a grant
of his restless Petitions.</p>
            <p>And now, if this be the Case; when
any one comes with a tedious, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded
Harangue to God, may not
God properly answer him with those
words, in <hi>Psal. 50. 21. Surely thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
I am altogether such an one as thy self?</hi>
And perhaps, upon a due, and rational
Examination of all the Follies, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencies,
that Men are apt to be guilty
of in Prayer, they will be all found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvable
into this one Thing, as the true
and sole Cause of them; namely, <hi>That
Men, when they pray, take God to be such
an one as themselves;</hi> and so treat him
accordingly. The malignity and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of which gross mistake, may reach
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107166:101"/>
farther, than possibly at first they can
well be aware of. For if it be Idolatry
to pray to God the Father, represented
under the shape of a Man, can it be at
all better, to pray to him as represented
under the weakness of a Man? Nay, if
the misrepresentation of the Object
makes the Idolatry; certainly, by how
much the worse, and more scandalous
the Misrepresentation is, by so much
the grosser, and more intolerable, must
be the Idolatry. To confirm which,
we may add this Consideration, That
Christ himself, even now in his glorified
Estate in Heaven, wears the Body, and
consequently the Shape of a Man, though
he is far from any of his Infirmities, or
Imperfections: And therefore, no doubt,
to represent God to our selves under
these latter, must needs be more Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
and Irreligious, than to represent
him under the former. But to one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of the preceding Discourse, some
may reply and object; That if God's
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107166:101"/>
Omniscience, by rendring it impossible
for him to be Informed, be a sufficient
Reason against Prolixity, or length of
Prayer; it will follow, That it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
a Reason against the using any
Words at all in Prayer; since the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
use of Words is to inform the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whom we speak to; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
where Information is impossible,
Words must needs be useless and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, First by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
That if the <hi>sole</hi> use of Words, or
Speech, were to <hi>inform the Person, whom
we speak to,</hi> the Consequence would be
firm and good, and equally conclude
against the use of any Words at all in
Prayer. But therefore, in the second
place, I deny Information to be the sole
and adequate use of Words, or Speech,
or indeed any use of them at all, when
either the person spoken to, needs not
to be informed, and withall, is known
not to need it, as sometimes it falls out
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107166:102"/>
with Men, or, when he is uncapable of
being informed, as it is always with God.
But the proper use of Words, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we speak to God in Prayer, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to pay Him <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi>
God having, by an express Precept, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
us the use of Words in Prayer,
Commanding us in <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15. and
many other Scriptures, <hi>to call upon him:</hi>
and in <hi>Luk. 11. 21. When we pray, to
say, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. But no where has
he Commanded us to doe this with
Prolixity, or Multiplicity of Words.
And though, it must be confessed, that
we may sometimes answer this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
of calling upon <hi>God,</hi> and
saying, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. by mental
or inward Prayer; yet since these
Words, in their first and most proper
signification, import a vocal Address,
there is no doubt, but the direct design
of the Command is to enjoyn this also,
wheresoever there is ability and power
to perform it. So that we see here the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107166:102"/>
Necessity of <hi>vocal Prayer,</hi> founded upon
the Authority of a Divine Precept;
whereas, for <hi>long Prolix Prayer,</hi> no such
Precept can be produced; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
the Divine Omniscience may
be a sufficient Reason against Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Words in Prayer, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
nothing simply or absolutely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the bare use of them. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
that we may not seem to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
bare Command, unseconded by
Reason, (which yet, in the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
it is impossible to doe,) there
is this great Reason for, and use of
Words in Prayer, without the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Informing the person whom
we pray to; and that is, to <hi>acknowledge
and own those wants</hi> before God, that we
supplicate for a Relief of. It being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
proper and rational, to own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a thing even to him, who
knew it before: For as much as this is
so far from offering to communicate,
or make known to him the thing so
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107166:103"/>
acknowledged, that it rather pre-supposes
in him an Antecedent knowledge of it,
and comes in only as a subsequent As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and subscription to the Reality and
Truth of such a Knowledge. For to
<hi>acknowledge</hi> a thing in the first sense of
the word, does by no means signify a
design of Notifying that thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but is truly and properly a man's
passing Sentence upon himself, and his
own Condition: There being no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the World, for a Man to expect
that God should relieve, and supply
those Wants, that he himself will not
own, nor take notice of; any more, than
for a Man to hope for a pardon of those
Sins, that he cannot find in his heart to
confess. And yet (I suppose) no Man
in his right Senses, does, or can imagine,
that God is informed, or brought to the
knowledge of those Sins, by any such
Confession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And so much for the clearing of this
Objection; And, in the whole, for the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:107166:103"/>
first Argument produced by us,</hi> for
Brevity, and against Prolixity <hi>of Prayer;
namely,</hi> That all the Reasons that can be
assigned for Prolixity of Speech in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with Men, cease, and become no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for it at all, when we are to speak or
pray to God.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> The second Argument for <hi>Paucity
of Words</hi> in Prayer, shall be taken from
the <hi>Paucity</hi> of <hi>those things</hi> that are Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be prayed for. And surely,
where few Things are necessary, few
Words should be sufficient. For where
the <hi>Matter</hi> is not Commensurate to the
Words, all Speaking is but Tautology;
that being truly and really Tautology,
where the same thing is repeated, though
under never so much variety of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
As it is but the same Man still,
though he appears every day, or every
hour, in a new and different Sute of
Clothes.</p>
            <p>The adequate Subject of our Prayers
(I shew'd at first) comprehended in it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107166:104"/>
               <hi>Things of Necessity,</hi> and <hi>Things of Charity.</hi>
As to the first of which, I know nothing
absolutely necessary, but <hi>Grace</hi> here, and
<hi>Glory</hi> hereafter. And for the other, we
know what the Apostle says, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 8.
Having food and raiment, let us be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
content.</hi> Nature is satisfied with a
little, and Grace with less. And now,
if the Matter of our Prayers lies within
so narrow a compass, why should the
Dress and Out-side of them spread and
diffuse it self into so wide and dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
a largeness? By reason of
which, our Words will be forced to
hang loose and light, without any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to support them; much after the
same rate, that it is said to be in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation;
where <hi>Accidents</hi> are left
in the lurch by their proper <hi>Subject,</hi>
that gives them the slip, and so leaves
those poor slender Beings to uphold and
shift for themselves.</p>
            <p>In Brevity of Speech, a Man does
not so much speak Words, as Things;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107166:104"/>
Things in their precise and naked
Truth; and stripp'd of their Rhetorical
Mask, and their Fallacious Gloss: And
therefore, in <hi>Athens,</hi> they circumscribed
the Pleadings of their Orators by a strict
Law, cutting off Prologues and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,
and Commanding them to an
immediate Representation of the Case,
by an impartial and succinct Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of meer Matter of Fact. And this
was, indeed, to speak Things fit for a
Judge to hear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because it argued the
Pleader also a Judge of what was fit for
him to speak.</p>
            <p>And now, why should not this be
both Decency and Devotion too, when
we come to plead for our poor Souls
before the great Tribunal of Heaven?
It was the Saying of <hi>Solomon, A Word to
the Wise;</hi> and if so, certainly there can
be no necessity of many Words to Him,
who is Wisdom it self. For, can any
man think, that God delights to hear
him make Speeches, and to shew his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107166:105"/>
Parts, (as the word is) or to jumble a
multitude of misapplied Scripture-sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
together, interlarded with a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
nauseous Repetition of <hi>Ah Lord!</hi>
which some call <hi>exercising their Gifts,</hi> but
with a greater exercise of their Hearers
patience? Nay, does not he present his
Maker, not only with a more decent,
but also a more free and liberal Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who tenders him much in a little,
and brings him his whole Heart and
Soul wrapt up in three or four words,
than he who with full Mouth, and loud
Lungs, sends up whole Vollies of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
Breath to the Throne of Grace?
For neither in the esteem of God, or
Man, ought multitude of Words to pass
for any more: In the present Case, no
doubt, God accounts and accepts of the
former, as infinitely a more valuable
Offering than the latter. As that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
pays his Prince a much nobler and
more acceptable Tribute, who tenders
him a Purse of Gold, than he who brings
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107166:105"/>
him a whole Cart-load of Farthings; in
which, there is Weight without Worth,
and Number without Account.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> The third Argument for Brevity,
or Contractedness of Speech in Prayer,
shall be taken from the very Nature
and Condition of the person who prays;
which makes it impossible for him to
keep up the same fervour and attention
in a long Prayer, that he may in a short.
For as I first observed that the Mind
of Man cannot with the same force and
vigour attend two several Objects at
the same time; so neither can it with
the same force and earnestness exert it
self upon one and the same Object for
any long time. Great Intention of Mind
spending the Spirits too fast, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
its first freshness and agility long.
For while the Soul is a Retainer to the
Elements, and a Sojourner in the Body,
it must be content to submit its own
quickness and spirituality to the dullness
of its Vehicle, and to comply with the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107166:106"/>
pace of its inferiour Companion. Just
like a Man shut up in a Coach; who,
while he is so, must be willing to go
no faster than the Motion of the Coach
will carry him. He who does all by
the help of those subtile, refin'd parts of
Matter, called Spirits, must not think
to persevere at the same pitch of acting,
while those Principles of Activity flag.
No man begins and ends a long Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
with the same pace.</p>
            <p>But now, when Prayer has lost its
due fervour, and attention, (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are the very Vitals of it,) it is but
the <hi>Carkase</hi> of a Prayer; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
must needs be loathsome and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
to God: Nay, though the greatest
part of it should be enlivened, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with an actual Attention; yet
if that Attention fails to enliven any one
part of it, the whole is but a joyning
of the <hi>Living</hi> and the <hi>Dead</hi> together;
for which Conjunction, the <hi>Dead</hi> is not
at all the better, but the <hi>Living</hi> very
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107166:106"/>
much the worse. It is not length, nor
copiousness of Language, that is Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
any more than Bulk and Bigness
is Valour, or <hi>Flesh</hi> the measure of the
<hi>Spirit.</hi> A short Sentence may be often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a large and a mighty Prayer.
Devotion so managed, being like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in a Well; where you have fullness
in a little compass; which surely is
much nobler, than the same carried out
into many petit, creeping Rivulets,
with <hi>length</hi> and <hi>shallowness</hi> together. Let
him who prays, bestow all that strength,
fervour, and attention, upon Shortness
and Significance, that would otherwise
run out, and lose it self in Length and
Luxuriancy of Speech to no purpose.
Let not his Tongue out-strip his Heart;
nor presume to carry a Message to the
Throne of Grace, while that stays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.
Let him not think to support
so hard, and weighty a Duty, with a
tired, languishing, and be-jaded Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
To avoid which, let a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107166:107"/>
his Expression, where he cannot
enlarge his Affection; still remembring,
that nothing can be more absurd in it
self, nor more unacceptable to God,
than for one engaged in the great Work
of Prayer, to hold on <hi>speaking,</hi> after he
has left off <hi>praying;</hi> and to keep the <hi>lips</hi>
at work, when the <hi>spirit</hi> can do no
more.</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> The fourth Argument for short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or conciseness of Speech in Prayer,
shall be drawn from this, That it is the
most natural and lively way of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the utmost Agonies and Out-cries
of the Soul to God upon a quick, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
sense, either of a pressing Necessity,
or an approaching Calamity; which,
we know, are generally the chief Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Prayer, and the most effectual
Motives to bring Men upon their Knees,
in a vigorous Application of themselves,
to this great Duty. A person ready to
sink under his Wants, has neither time,
nor heart, to Rhetoricate, or make Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107166:107"/>
No Man begins a long Grace,
when he is ready to starve: Such an
one's Prayers are like the Relief he needs,
quick and suddain, short and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate:
He is like a Man in Torture upon
the Rack; whose Pains are too acute to
let his Words be many; and whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of Deliverance too impatient, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
the things he begs for, by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his begging it.</p>
            <p>It is a Common Saying; <hi>If a Man
does not know how to Pray, let him go to
Sea, and that will teach him.</hi> And we
have a notable Instance of what kind
of prayers Men are taught in that School,
even in the Disciples themselves, when
a Storm arose, and the Sea raged, and
the Ship was ready to be cast away, in
the 8<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Matthew.</hi> In which Case, we
doe not find that they fell presently to
harangue it about Seas and Winds, and
that dismal face of things, that must
needs appear all over the devouring Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at such a time: All which, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107166:108"/>
the like, might, no doubt, have been
very plentifull Topicks of Eloquence to
a Man, who should have lookt upon
these things from the Shoar; or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
of Wrecks and Tempests safe
and warm in his Parlour. But these
poor Wretches, who were now entring
(as they thought) into the very Jaws of
Death, and struggling with the last Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of Nature, upon the Sense of a
departing Life; and consequently, could
neither speak, nor think, any thing low
or ordinary in such a Condition, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
rallied up, and discharged the
whole Concern of their desponding Souls,
in that short Prayer, of but three words,
though much fuller, and more forcible,
than one of three thousand, in the 25th.
Verse of the fore-mentioned Chapter;
<hi>Save us, Lord, or we perish.</hi> Death makes
short work when it comes, and will
teach him, who would prevent it, to
make shorter. For surely no Man, who
thinks himself just a perishing, can be at
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107166:108"/>
leisure to be Eloquent; or judge it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sense, or Devotion, to begin a
long Prayer, when, in all likelihood,
he shall conclude his Life before it.</p>
            <p>5<hi>ly.</hi> The fifth and last Argument that
I shall produce for <hi>Brevity of Speech,</hi> or
<hi>Fewness of Words</hi> in Prayer, shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Examples which we find in
Scripture, of such as have been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for <hi>Brevity,</hi> and of such as have
been noted for <hi>Prolixity of Speech,</hi> in the
discharge of this Duty.</p>
            <p>1. And first for <hi>Brevity.</hi> To omit
all those notable Examples, which the Old
Testament affords us of it; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
our selves only to the New, in which
we are undoubtedly most concerned;
Was not this way of Praying, not only
Warranted, but Sanctified, and set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all that the Will of Man could
possibly except against it, by that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
exact Form of Prayer, prescribed
by the Greatest, the Holiest, and the
Wisest Man, that ever lived, even Christ
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107166:109"/>
himself, the Son of God, and Saviour
of the World? Was it not an instance
both of the truest Devotion, and the
fullest and most comprehensive Reason,
that ever proceeded from the Mouth of
Man? And yet withall, the shortest,
and most succinct Model, that ever
grasped all the Needs and Occasions
of Mankind, both Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
into so small a compass? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
had our Saviour thought fit to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie,
or be prolix, <hi>He, in whom were
hid all the Treasures of Wisdom,</hi> could not
want Matter; nor he who was himself
<hi>the Word,</hi> want Variety of the fittest to
have expressed his Mind by. But He
chose rather to contract the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of both Worlds into a few Lines,
and to unite both Heaven and Earth in
his Prayer, as he had done before in his
Person. And indeed one was a kind of
Copy, or Representation, of the other.</p>
            <p>So then, we see here Brevity in the
<hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Pattern,</hi> let us see it next in the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107166:109"/>
               <hi>Practice,</hi> and after that, in the <hi>Success</hi> of
Prayer. And first; we have the Practice,
as well as the Pattern of it, in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himself; and that, in the most sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
passage of his whole Life, even his
Preparation for his approaching Death.
In which dolorous Scene, when his whole
Soul was nothing but Sorrow, (that
great moving Spring of Invention and
Elocution,) and when Nature was put
to its last and utmost stretch, and so had
no refuge, or relief, but in Prayer; yet
even then, all this Horror, Agony, and
Distress of Spirit, delivers it self but in
two very short Sentences, in <hi>Matth. 26.
39. O my Father, if it be possible, let this
Cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I
will, but as thou wilt.</hi> And again, the
second time, with the like Brevity, and
the like Words. <hi>O my Father, if this Cup
may not pass from me, except I drink it,
thy Will be done.</hi> And lastly, the third
time also, he used the same short form
again; and yet in all this, he was (as we
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107166:110"/>
may say without a Metaphor) even
praying <hi>for Life;</hi> so far as the great
business, he was then about, to wit, the
Redemption of the World, would suffer
him to pray for it. All which Prayers
of our Saviour, and others of like Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
are properly such, as we call <hi>Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations;</hi>
an elegant Similitude from a
Dart, or Arrow, shot, or thrown out;
and such an one (we know) of a Yard
long, will fly farther, and strike deeper,
than one of Twenty.</p>
            <p>And then, in the last place, for the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of such brief Prayers; I shall give
you but three Instances of this, but they
shall be of Persons praying under the
Pressure of as great Miseries, as humane
Nature could well be afflicted with.
And the first shall be of the Leper, <hi>Matth.</hi>
8. 2. or, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> describes him, <hi>a
Man full of Leprosie, who came to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and Worshipped him;</hi> and, as St. <hi>Luke</hi>
again has it more particularly, <hi>fell on his
face before him,</hi> (which is the lowest, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107166:110"/>
most devout of all Postures of Worship,)
<hi>saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make
me clean.</hi> This was all his Prayer: And
the Answer to it was, That he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
cleansed. The next Instance
shall be of the poor <hi>blind Man,</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi>
18. 28. following our Saviour with this
earnest Prayer: <hi>Iesus, thou Son of David,
have Mercy upon me.</hi> His whole Prayer
was no more: For it is said in the next
<hi>verse,</hi> that he went on, repeating it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and again: <hi>Iesus, thou Son of David,
have Mercy upon me.</hi> And the Answer
he received was, That his Eyes were
opened, and his Sight restored.</p>
            <p>The third and last Instance shall be
of the <hi>Publican,</hi> in the same Chapter of
St. <hi>Luke;</hi> praying under a lively sense
of as great a Leprosie, and Blindness of
Soul, as the other two could have of
Body: in the 13th. Verse, <hi>He smote upon
his Breast, saying, God be mercifull to me
a sinner.</hi> He spoke no more; though
'tis said in the 10th. <hi>Verse,</hi> that he went
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107166:111"/>
               <hi>solemnly and purposely up to the Temple to
pray:</hi> The issue and success of which
Prayer, was, <hi>That he went home justified,</hi>
before one of those, whom all the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Church revered as absolutely the highest
and most heroick Examples of Piety,
and most beloved Favourites of Heaven,
in the whole World. And now, if the
force and vertue of these short Prayers
could rise so high, as <hi>to cleanse a Leper,
to give sight to the Blind, and to justify a
Publican;</hi> and, if the Worth of a Prayer
may at all be measured by the Success
of it, I suppose, no Prayers whatsoever
can do more; and, I never yet heard
or read of any <hi>long Prayer,</hi> that did so
much. Which brings on the other
part of this our fifth and last Argument,
which was to be drawn from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of such, as have been noted in
Scripture for Prolixity, or Length of
Prayer. And of this, there are only two
mentioned; <hi>The Heathens, and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees.</hi>
The first, the grand Instance of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107166:111"/>
               <hi>Idolatry;</hi> the other, of <hi>Hypocrisy:</hi> But
Christ forbids us the Imitation of both;
<hi>When ye pray,</hi> says our Saviour in the
6th. of <hi>Matthew, be ye not like the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:</hi>
But in what? Why, in this, <hi>That
they think they shall be heard for their much
speaking;</hi> in the 7th. <hi>Verse.</hi> It is not the
Multitude, that prevails in Armies, and
much less in Words. And then for the
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> whom our Saviour represents,
as the very vilest of Men, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Cheats. We have them amusing
the World with pretences of a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
Devotion, while their Heart was
all that time in their Neighbour's Coffers.
For, does not our Saviour expressly tell
us, in <hi>Luke</hi> 20. and the two last Verses,
That the great Tools, the Hooks or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
by which they compass'd their worst,
their wickedest, and most rapacious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
were <hi>Long Prayers?</hi> Prayers made
only <hi>for a shew</hi> or colour; and that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the
basest and most degenerous sort of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy,
even the robbing the Spittle, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107166:112"/>
               <hi>devouring the Houses</hi> of poor, helpless, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
Widows. Their Devotion serv'd all
along but as an Instrument to their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice,
as a Factor or Under-Agent to
their Extortion. A Practice, which duly
seen into, and stript of its Hypocritical
Blinds, could not but look very odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and ill-favouredly; and therefore,
in come their <hi>long Robes,</hi> and their <hi>long
Prayers</hi> together, and cover all. And,
the truth is, neither the Length of one,
nor of the other, is ever found so use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as when there is something more
than ordinary that would not be seen.
This was the <hi>gainfull Godliness</hi> of the
<hi>Pharisees;</hi> and, I believe, upon good
Observation, you will hardly find, any
like the <hi>Pharisees</hi> for their long Prayers,
who are not also extremely like them
for something else. And thus having
given you five Arguments for <hi>Brevity,</hi>
and against <hi>Prolixity</hi> of Prayer; let us
now make this our <hi>other great Rule,</hi>
whereby to judge of the Prayers of <hi>our
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107166:112"/>
Church,</hi> and the Prayers of those who
<hi>Dissent</hi> and <hi>Divide</hi> from it. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For that excellent Body of
Prayers contained in our Liturgy, and
both compiled and enjoyned by Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority. Have we not here, a
great Instance of Brevity and Fulness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
cast into several, short, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Collects, each containing a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
entire, and well-managed Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
The whole Sett of them being like
a string of Pearls, exceeding rich in
Conjunction; and therefore of no small
price, or value, even single, and by
themselves. Nothing could have been
composed with greater Judgment; Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Prayer being so short, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
it should weary; and withall,
so pertinent, that it is impossible it
should cloy the Devotion. And indeed,
so admirably fitted are they all to the
common Concerns of a Christian Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
that when the Rubrick enjoyns but
the use of some of them, our Worship
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107166:113"/>
is not imperfect; and when we use them
all, there is none of them superfluous.</p>
            <p>And the Reason assigned by some
learned Men for the Preference of many
short Prayers, before a continued long
one, is unanswerable; Namely, That
by the former there is a more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repeated mention made of the Name,
and some great Attribute of God, as
the encouraging Ground of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Him; and withall, of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and Mediation of Christ, as the
only thing, that can promise us success,
in what we pray for: Every distinct
Petition <hi>beginning</hi> with the <hi>former,</hi> and
<hi>ending</hi> with the <hi>latter:</hi> By thus annexing
of which to each particular thing, that
we ask for, we doe manifestly confess,
and declare, That we cannot expect to
obtain any one thing at the hands of
God, but with a particular renewed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Merits of a Mediator; and
withall, re-mind the Congregation of
the same, by making it their part to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107166:113"/>
renew a distinct <hi>Amen</hi> to every distinct
<hi>Petition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Add to this, the Excellent contrivance
of a great part of our Liturgy, into Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate
Responses; by which means, the
People are put to bear a considerable
share in the whole Service: which
makes it almost impossible for them,
to be only idle Hearers, or, which is
worse, meer Lookers on: As they are
very often, and may be always (if they
can but keep their Eyes open) at the
long, tedious Prayers of the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.</hi>
And this indeed is that, which
makes and denominates our Liturgy
truly and properly a Book of <hi>Common-prayer.</hi>
For, I think, I may truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch
(how strange soever it may
seem at first) that there is no such thing
as <hi>Common,</hi> or <hi>Ioint-prayer,</hi> any-where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the principal Dissenters from
the Church of <hi>England:</hi> For, in the
<hi>Romish</hi> Communion, the Priest says
over the appointed Prayers only to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107166:114"/>
himself, and the rest of the People not
hearing a word of what he says, repeat
also their own particular Prayers to
themselves; and when they have done,
go their way: Not all at once, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe they come at once, but scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringly,
one after another, according
as they have finished their Devotions.
And then, for the <hi>Nonconformists;</hi> their
Prayers being all <hi>extempore,</hi> it is (as we
have shewn before) hardly possible for
<hi>any,</hi> and utterly impossible for <hi>all,</hi> to
joyn in them: For, surely, People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
joyn in a Prayer before they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it; nor can it be imagined, that
all Capacities should presently and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
understand what they <hi>hear,</hi>
when, possibly, <hi>Holder-forth</hi> himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
not what he <hi>says.</hi> From
all which we may venture to conclude,
That, that excellent thing, <hi>Common-prayer,</hi>
which is the joynt Address of an whole
Congregation, with united Voice, as well
as Heart, sending up their Devotions to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107166:114"/>
Almighty God, is no-where to be found
in these Kingdoms, but in that best and
nearest Copy of Primitive, Christian
Worship, the Divine Service, as it is
performed according to the Orders of
our Church.</p>
            <p>As for those long Prayers, so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
used by some before their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
the Constitution and Canons of
our Church are not at all responsible
for them, having provided us better
things, and with great Wisdom appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Form of Prayer, to be used by all
before their Sermons. But as for this
way of Praying, now generally in use,
as it was first took up upon an humour
of Novelty, and Popularity, and by the
same carried on, till it had passed into a
Custom, and so put the Rule of the
Church first out of Use, and then out
of Countenance also; so, if it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considered, it will, in the very nature
of the thing it self, be found a very
senceless and absurd practice. For, can
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107166:115"/>
there be any Sense or Propriety in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
a new, tedious Prayer in the
Pulpit, just after the Church has, for
near an hour together, with great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of Offices, sutable to all the Needs
of the Congregation, been praying for
all, that can possibly be fit for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to pray for? Nothing certainly can
be more irrational. For which Cause,
amongst many more, that old sober
Form of <hi>Bidding Prayer,</hi> which, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Law and Reason, has been just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of the Church by this Upstart,
Puritanical Encroachment, ought, with
great Reason, to be restored by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and both the use and Users of it,
by a strict and solemn Reinforcement of
the Canon upon all, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be rescued from that unjust Scorn
of the Factious and Ignorant, which the
Tyranny of the contrary, usurping Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
will otherwise expose them to.
For surely, it can neither be Decency
nor Order for our Clergy to <hi>Conform</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:107166:115"/>
to the Fanaticks, as many in their Prayers
before Sermon now-a-days doe.</p>
            <p>And thus having accounted for the
Prayers of our Church, according to
the great Rule prescribed in the <hi>Text,
Let thy Words be few:</hi> Let us now, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the same, consider also the
way of Praying, so much used, and
applauded by such, as have renounced
the Communion, and Liturgy of our
Church; and it is but reason, that they
should bring us something better in the
room of what they have so disdainfully
cast off. But, on the contrary, are not
all their Prayers exactly after the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish</hi>
and <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Copy? always
notable for those two Things, Length
and Tautology? Two whole Hours
for one Prayer, at a Fast, used to be
reckoned but a moderate Dose; and
that, for the most part, fraught with
such irreverent, blasphemous Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that, to repeat them, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
the place I am speaking in; and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107166:116"/>
indeed, they seldom <hi>carried on the work
of such a Day</hi> (as their Phrase was,) but
they left the Church in need of a new
Consecration. Add to this, the Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
and Confusion, the endless Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions,
and the unsufferable Nonsense,
that never failed to hold out, even with
their utmost Prolixity; so that in all
their <hi>long Fasts,</hi> from first to last, from
<hi>seven</hi> in the <hi>Morning,</hi> to <hi>seven</hi> in the
<hi>Evening,</hi> (which was their measure) the
Pulpit was always the <hi>emptiest</hi> Thing
in the Church: And I never knew such
a <hi>Fast</hi> kept by them, but their Hearers
had Cause to begin a <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> as
soon as they had done. And, the truth
is, when I consider the Matter of their
Prayers; so full of Ramble, and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
and in every respect, so very
like the language of a Dream; and
compare it with their Carriage of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Prayer, with their <hi>Eyes,</hi> for the
most part, shut, and their <hi>Arms</hi> stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, in Yawning posture, a Man
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107166:116"/>
that should hear any of them pray,
might, by a very pardonable Error, be
induced to think, that he was all the
time hearing one <hi>talking in his sleep:</hi>
besides the strange Vertue, which their
Prayers had to procure sleep in others
too. So that he who should be present
at all their long Cant, would shew a
greater Ability in <hi>Watching,</hi> than ever
they could pretend to in <hi>Praying,</hi> if he
could forbear sleeping, having so strong
a Provocation to it, and so fair an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
for it. In a word, such were
their Prayers, both for Matter and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
that could any one truly and
exactly write them out, it would be the
shrewdest, and most effectual way of
Writing against them, that could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be thought of.</p>
            <p>I should not have thus troubled either
you, or my self, by raking into the Dirt
and Dunghill of these men's Devotions,
upon the account of any thing, either
done or said by them in the late times
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:107166:117"/>
of Confusion; for as they have the
<hi>King</hi>'s, so I wish them <hi>God's pardon also,</hi>
for both, whom, I am sure, they have
offended much more, than they have
both Kings put together. But that
which has provoked me thus to rip up,
and expose to you their nauseous, and
ridiculous way of addressing to God,
even upon the most solemn Occasions,
is that intolerably rude and unprovoked
Insolence and Scurrility, with which they
are every day reproaching and scoffing
at our Liturgy, and the Users of it, and
thereby alienating the Minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from it, to such a degree, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Thousands are drawn by them into
a fatal Schism; A Schism that, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of, and continued in, will as
infallibly ruin their Souls, as Theft,
Whoredom, Murther, or any other of
the most crying, damning Sins whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
But leaving this to the Justice of
the Government, to which it belongs,
to protect us in our Spiritual, as well
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107166:117"/>
as in our Temporal Concerns, I shall
only say this, That nothing can be
more for the Honour of our Liturgy,
than to find it despised only by those
who have made themselves remarkable
to the World for despising the <hi>Lord's
Prayer</hi> as much.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, for our selves of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who, without
pretending to any New Lights, think
it equally a Duty and Commendation
to be <hi>Wise,</hi> and to be <hi>Devout</hi> only to
<hi>Sobriety,</hi> and who judge it no dishonour
to God himself, to be Worshipped ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law and Rule. If the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Precept and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of our Saviour, and lastly, the
Piety and Experience of those Excellent
Men, and Martyrs, who first composed,
and afterwards owned our Liturgy with
their dearest Blood, may be look'd upon
as safe, and sufficient Guides to us in our
publick Worship of God; then, upon
the joint Authority of all these, we may
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107166:118"/>
pronounce our Liturgy the greatest
Treasure of Rational Devotion in the
Christian World. And I know no
Prayer necessary, that is not in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
but one; which is this: <hi>That
God would vouchsafe to continue the Liturgy
it self in Use, Honour, and Veneration in
this Church for ever.</hi> And I doubt not,
but all wise, sober, and good Christians,
will with equal Judgment and Affection
give it their <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to God the Father, God the Son, and
God the Holy Ghost, Three Persons and
One God, be rendred and ascribed, as is
most due, all Praise, Might, Majesty and
Dominion, both now and for evermore.
<hi>Amen.</hi>

<hi>Verse,</hi> to the end of the 31st. (the
<hi>Verse</hi> immediately going before
the <hi>Text</hi>) we have a Catalogue of the
blackest Sins, that humane Nature, in
its highest Depravation, is capable of
committing; and this so perfect, that
there seems to be no Sin imaginable,
but what may be reduced to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
under, some of the Sins here spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.
In a word, we have an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lives and Practices of the
whole Heathen World; that is, of all
the Baseness and Villainy, that both the
Corruption of Nature, and the Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:107166:120"/>
of the Devil, could for so many
Ages, by all the Arts and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
all the Motives and Incentives of
Sinning bring the Sons of Men to. And
yet, as full and comprehensive as this
Catalogue of Sin seems to be, it is but
of Sin under a Limitation. An Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality
of Sin under a Certain Kind;
that is, of all Sins of <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>personal</hi>
Commission. And, you will say, is not
this a sufficient Comprehension of All?
For, is not a Man's Person the Compass
of his Actions? Or, can he Operate fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than he does Exist? Why, yes, in
some sense he may: He may not only
<hi>commit such and such Sins himself, but also
take pleasure in others, that do commit them.</hi>
Which Expression implies these two
things: First, That thus to <hi>take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in other men's Sins,</hi> is a <hi>distinct</hi> Sin
from all the former; And, secondly,
that it is much <hi>greater</hi> than the former.
For as much, as these terms, <hi>not only doe
the same, but also take pleasure,</hi> &amp;c. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:107166:120"/>
               <hi>Aggravation,</hi> as well as <hi>Distinction;</hi>
and are properly an Advance <hi>à minore
ad majus,</hi> a progress to a further degree.
And this, indeed, is the farthest that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Pravity can reach, the highest
point of Villainy, that the debauched
Powers of Man's Mind can ascend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
For, surely, that Sin, that exceeds
<hi>Idolatry, monstrous, unnatural Lusts, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
Maliciousness, Envy, Murther, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
Back-biting, Hatred of God, Spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
Pride, Disobedience to Parents, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-breaking,
Want of Natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Implacableness, Unmercifulness, and the
like:</hi> I say, that Sin, that is a Pitch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all these, must needs be such an
one, as must non-plus the Devil himself,
to proceed further: It is the very Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
the Fulness, and the concluding
Period of Sin, the last Line, and finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stroke of the Devil's Image drawn
upon the Soul of Man.</p>
            <p>Now the sense of the Words may be
fully and naturally cast into this one
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107166:121"/>
Proposition, which shall be the Subject
of the following Discourse: <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the guilt arising from a Man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting,
or taking pleasure in other Men's
Sins, or</hi> (which is all one) <hi>in other Men
for their Sins, is greater than he can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
contract by a Commission of the same
Sins in his own Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the handling of which, I cannot
but think it superfluous, to offer at any
Explication of what it is, <hi>to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in other Men's Sins;</hi> it being impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for any Man to be so far unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Motions and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his own Mind, as not to know,
how it is affected and disposed, when
any thing pleases, or delights him. And
therefore I shall state the prosecution of
the Proposition upon these Three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Things.</p>
            <p>I. I shall shew <hi>what it is</hi> that brings
a Man to such a disposition of Mind, <hi>as</hi>
to take pleasure in other men's Sins.</p>
            <p>II. I shall shew the Reasons, <hi>Why</hi> a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107166:121"/>
Man's being disposed to doe so, comes
to be attended with such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Guilt: And,</p>
            <p>III. and Lastly, I shall declare <hi>what
kind of Persons</hi> are to be reckoned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Character.</p>
            <p>Of each of which in their Order.
And first for the</p>
            <p>I. Of these, <hi>What it is that brings a man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In order to which, I shall premise
these Four Considerations.</p>
            <p>1. That every Man naturally has a
distinguishing Sense of <hi>Turpe &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestum;</hi>
of what is <hi>honest,</hi> and what is
<hi>dishonest;</hi> of what it fit, and what is not
fit to be done. There are those Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Principles, and Rules of Action, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
up in that part of Man's Mind,
called by the Schools <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that, like
the <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> set up by God
himself in the Heart of every Man, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
to him, both what he is to doe,
and what to avoid: They are <hi>a Light,
lighting every Man that cometh into the
World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:107166:122"/>
And in respect of which principally
it is, that God is said not to have <hi>left
himself without witness</hi> in the World; there
being something fixed in the Nature of
Man, that will be sure to testifie and
declare for him.</p>
            <p>2. The second Thing to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
is, That there is consequently
upon this distinguishing Principle an
inward satisfaction, or dissatisfaction, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
in the Heart of every Man, after
he has done a good, or an evil Action.
An Action agreeable to, or deviating
from this great Rule. And this, no
doubt, proceeds not only from the real
Unsutableness, that every thing sinfull,
or dishonest, bears to the Nature of
Man, but also from a secret, inward,
fore-boding Fear, that some Evil or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will follow the doing of that, which
a Man's own Conscience disallows him
in. For, no Man naturally is, or can
be, chearfull, immediately upon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a wicked Action. There being
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107166:122"/>
something within him, that presently
gives Sentence against him for it: Which,
no question, is the Voice of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
speaking in the Hearts of Men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they understand it or no; and by
secret Intimations giving the Sinner a
fore-tast of that direfull Cup, which he
is like to drink more deeply of hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>3. The third Thing to be considered,
is, That this distinguishing <hi>Sense of good
and evil,</hi> and this satisfaction, or dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
of Mind, consequent upon a
Man's acting sutably, or unsutably to it,
is a Principle neither presently, nor easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to be worn out, or extinguished.
For, besides, that it is founded in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(which kind of things are always
most durable, and lasting) the great
important End that God designs it for,
(which is no less than the Government
of the Noblest part of the World, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind)
sufficiently shews the Necessity of
its being rooted deep in the Heart, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:107166:123"/>
put beyond the Danger of being torn
up by any ordinary Violence done to
it.</p>
            <p>4. The fourth and last Thing to be
considered, is, That, that which weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,
and directly tends to extinguish this
Principle, (so far as 'tis capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extinguished) is an inferior, sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Principle, which receives its Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
from Objects clean contrary to
the former; and, which affect a Man,
in the state of this present life, much
more warmly and vividly than those,
which affect only his Nobler part, his
<hi>Mind.</hi> So that there being a Contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
between those things, that Conscience
enclines to, and those that entertain the
Senses; and since the more quick and
affecting pleasure still arises from these
latter, it follows, that the Gratifications
of these are more powerfull to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Principles of Action, than the
other, and consequently is, for the
most part, too hard for, and victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107166:123"/>
over, the Dictates of Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>Now from these Four Considerations,
thus premised, we naturally inferr these
Two things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That no man is quickly, or
easily, brought to take a full pleasure
and delight in his own Sins. For, though
Sin offers it self in never so pleasing and
alluring a Dress, at first, yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse,
and inward Regrets of the Soul,
upon the Commission of it, infinitely
over-balance those faint and transient
Gratifications it affords the Senses. So
that, upon the whole matter, the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
even at his highest pitch of Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is not pleased with it so much,
but he is afflicted more. And, as long
as these inward rejolts and recoilings of
the Mind continue, (which they will
certainly doe for a considerable part of
a Man's life) the Sinner will find his
Accounts of Pleasure very poor and
short; being so mixed, and indeed over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:107166:124"/>
with the contrary Impressions of
Trouble upon his Mind, that it is but
a bitter-sweet at best; and the fine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of the Serpent doe by no means
make amends for the smart, and poison
of his Sting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other thing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
is, That, as no Man is quickly,
or easily brought to take a full pleasure
or delight in his own Sins, so much less
easily can he be brought to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in those of other Men. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, Because the chief Motive (as we
have observed) that induces a Man to
Sin, which is the Gratification of his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Part, by a sinfull Act, cannot be
had from the Sins of another Man;
<hi>since</hi> naturally, and directly, they affect
only the Agent that commits them. For,
certainly another man's Intemperance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
affect my Sensuality, any more, than
the Meat and Drink, that I take into my
Mouth, can please his Palate: But of
this more fully in some of the following
Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:107166:124"/>
In the mean time, it is evident from
Reason, that there is a considerable
Difficulty in a Man's arriving to such
a disposition of Mind, as shall make
him take pleasure in other men's Sins;
and yet, it is also as evident from the
Text, and from Experience too, that
some Men are brought to doe so. And
therefore, since there is no Effect, of
what kind soever, but is resolvable into
some Cause: We will enquire into the
Cause of this vile and preter-natural
Temper of Mind, that should make a
Man please himself with that, which
can no ways reach or affect those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and Principles, which Nature
has made the proper Seat, and Subject
of Pleasure. Now the Causes (or at
least some of the Causes) that debauch
and corrupt the Mind of Man to such
a degree, as to take pleasure in other
men's Sins, are these Five.</p>
            <p>1. A Commission of the same Sins
in a Man's own Person. This is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:107166:125"/>
in the very Words of the Text;
where it is said of such persons, that
<hi>they not only doe the same things;</hi> which
must therefore imply, <hi>that they doe them.</hi>
It is Conversation, and Acquaintance,
that must give delight in Things and
Actions, as well as in Persons. And it
is Tryal that must begin the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
It being hardly imaginable, that
one should be delighted with a Sin at
<hi>second hand,</hi> till he has known it <hi>at the
first.</hi> Delight is the Natural Result of
Practice, and Experiment; and when it
flows from any thing else, so far it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
from Nature. None look with
so much pleasure upon the Works of
Art, as those who are Artists themselves.
They are therefore their delight, because
they were heretofore their Imployment;
and they love to see such things, because
they onec loved to doe them. In like
manner, a Man must Sin himself into
a Love of other men's Sins; for a bare
Notion or Speculation of this black Art
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:107166:125"/>
will not carry him so far. No sober,
temperate Person in the World (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
other Sins he may be inclinable
to, and guilty of,) can look with any
Complacency upon the Drunkenness
and Sottishness of his Neighbour: Nor
can any Chast person (be his other
failings what they will) reflect with any
pleasure or delight, upon the filthy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Conversation of another, though
never so much in fashion, and vouched
not by common Use only, but Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause.
No; he must be first an Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
thorough-paced Practitioner of
these Vices himself; and they must have
endeared themselves to him by those
personal Gratifications, he had received
from them, before he can come to like
them so far, as to be pleased, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd
with them, wheresoever he sees
them. It is possible indeed, that a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or a chast Person, upon the Stock
of <hi>Ill-will, Envy,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Pride,</hi> (which
is all the Religion that some have) may
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:107166:126"/>
be glad to see the Intemperance, and
Debauchery of some about them: but
it is impossible, that such Persons should
take any delight in the Men themselves
for being so. The truth is, in such a
case, they doe not properly delight in
the Vice it self, though they inwardly
rejoice (and <hi>after a godly sort,</hi> no doubt)
to see another guilty of it; but they
delight in the mischief and disaster,
which, they know, it will assuredly
bring upon him, whom they hate, and
wish ill to: They rejoice not in it, as
in a delightfull Object, but as in a Cause
and Means of their Neighbour's Ruin.
So gratefull, nay, so delicious are even
the horridest Villainies committed by
others to the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Piety of some;
who, in the mean time, can be wholly
unconcerned for the Reproach brought
thereby upon the Name of God, and
the Honour of Religion, so long as by
the same their Sanctified Spleen is grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in their Brother's Infamy, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:107166:126"/>
This therefore we may reckon upon,
that scarce any Man passes to a liking
of Sin in others, but by first practising
it himself; and consequently, may take
it for a shrewd Indication, and Sign,
whereby to judge of the Manners of
those, who have sinned with too much
Art and Caution, to suffer the Eye of
the World to charge some Sins directly
upon their Conversation. For, though
such kind of Men have lived never so
much upon the Reserve, as to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Behaviour, yet if they be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to have a particular delight in, and
fondness for <hi>Persons</hi> noted for any sort
of Sin, it is ten to one, but there was
a Communication in the Sin, before
there was so in Affection. The Man
has, by this, directed us to a Copy of
Himself; and, though we cannot always
come to a sight of the Original, yet by
a true Copy we may know all <hi>that is
in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:107166:127"/>
2<hi>ly.</hi> A second Cause, that brings a
Man to take pleasure in other men's
Sins, is not only a Commission of those
Sins in his own Person, but also a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of them against the full Light
and Conviction of his Conscience. For
this also is expressed in the Text; where
the Persons charged with this wretched
Disposition of Mind are said to have
been such <hi>as knew the iudgment of God,
that they, who committed such things, were
worthy of Death.</hi> They knew that there
was a righteous, and a searching Law,
directly forbidding such Practices; and
they knew that it carried with it the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Stamp, that it was the <hi>Law of God;</hi>
they knew also, that the Sanction of it
was under the greatest, and dreadfullest
of all Penalties, <hi>Death.</hi> And this sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(one would think) was Knowledge
enough to have opened both a man's
Eyes, and his Heart too; his Eyes to
see, and his Heart to consider the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
mischief that the Commission of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107166:127"/>
the Sin set before him must infallibly
plunge him into. Nevertheless, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
here mentioned were resolved to
venture, and to commit the Sin, even
while Conscience stood protesting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. They were such, as broke
through all Mounds of Law, such as
laugh'd at the <hi>Sword of Vengeance,</hi> which
Divine Justice brandish'd in their faces.
For, we must know, that God has set
a <hi>flaming Sword</hi> not only before <hi>Paradise,</hi>
but before <hi>Hell</hi> it self also; to keep Men
out of this, as well as out of the other. And
Conscience is the <hi>Angel,</hi> into whose hand
this <hi>Sword</hi> is put. But if now, the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
shall not only <hi>wrestle</hi> with this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi>
but <hi>throw</hi> him too; and win so
complete a Victory over his Conscience,
that all these Considerations shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to strike no Terror into his Mind,
lay no Restraint upon his Lusts, no
Controll upon his Appetites; he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
too strong for the Means of
Grace; and his Heart lies open, like a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:107166:128"/>
broad and high Road for all the Sin
and Villainy in the World freely to
pass through.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, if we impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Nature of these <hi>Sins against Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
we shall find them such strange
Paradoxes, that a man must baulk all
Common Principles, and act contrary
to the Natural way and motive of all
Humane Actions, in the Commission of
them. For that, which naturally moves
a man to doe any thing, must be the
Apprehension and Expectation of some
good from the thing, which he is about
to doe: And that which naturally keeps
a man from doing of a thing, must be
the Apprehension and Fear of some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
likely to ensue from that Thing, or
Action, that he is ready to engage in.
But now, for a man to doe a thing,
while his Conscience, the best Light that
he has to judge by, assures him, that he
shall be infinitely, unsupportably mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
if he does it; this is certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107166:128"/>
and (one would imagine) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
            <p>And therefore, so far as one may
judge, while a man acts against his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
he acts by a Principle of direct
<hi>Infidelity,</hi> and does not really believe
that those things, that God has thus
threatned, shall ever come to pass. For,
though he may yield a general, faint
Assent to the Truth of those Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as they stand recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
yet, for a through, Practical belief,
that those general Propositions shall be
particularly made good upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
no doubt, for the time that he is
sinning against Conscience, such a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
has no place in his Mind. Which
being so, it is easie to conceive, how
ready and disposed this must needs leave
the Soul, to admit of any, even the
most horrid, unnatural Proposals, that
the Devil himself can suggest: For Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
being once extinct, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God withdrawn, (which never
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:107166:129"/>
stays with a Man, when Conscience has
once left him) the Soul, like the <hi>first
Matter to all Forms,</hi> has an Universal
Propensity to all Lewdness. For every
Violation of Conscience proportionably
wears off something of its Native Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
which Tenderness being the
Cause of that Anguish and Remorse that
it feels, upon the Commission of Sin;
it follows, that when, by degrees, it
comes to have worn off all this Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Sinner will find no Trouble of
Mind upon his doing the very wickedest,
and worst of Actions; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that this is the most direct and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Introduction to all sorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Sin.</p>
            <p>For which Reason it was, that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<hi>Sinning against Conscience</hi> for one
of the Causes of this vile Temper, and
Habit of Mind, which we are now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
of: Not that it has any special
productive Efficiency of this particular
sort of Sinning, more than of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:107166:129"/>
but that it is a general Cause of
this, as of all other great Vices; and
that it is impossible, but a Man must
have first passed this notable Stage, and
got his Conscience throughly debauched,
and hardned, before he can arrive to
the height of Sin; which I account the
delighting in other men's Sins to be.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> A third Cause of this Villainous
disposition of Mind, <hi>besides</hi> a man's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Commission of such and such Sins,
and his Commission of them against
Conscience, must be also his Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in them. For, God forbid, that
every single Commission of a Sin,
though great for its Kind, and withall,
acted against Conscience, for its Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
should so far deprave the Soul,
and bring it to such a <hi>Reprobate Sense,</hi>
and Condition, as to <hi>take pleasure in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men's Sins.</hi> For, we know what a
foul Sin <hi>David</hi> committed, and what a
Crime St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself fell into; both
of them, no doubt, fully and clearly
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107166:130"/>
against the Dictates of their Conscience
yet we do not find, that either of them
was thereby brought to such an impious
frame of Heart, as to delight in their
own Sins, and much less in other men's.
And therefore, it is not every sinfull Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Conscience that can <hi>quench the
Spirit,</hi>
to such a degree, as we have been
speaking of; but it must be a long, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
Course and Custom of Sinning
after this manner, that, at length, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and ends in such a cursed Effect.
For, this is so great a Master-piece in
Sin, that no Man begins with it: He
must have pass'd his <hi>Tyrocinium,</hi> or <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitiate,</hi>
in Sinning, before he can come
to this, be he never so quick a Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
No man can mount so fast, as
to set his Foot upon the highest step of
the Ladder at first. Before a man can
come to be pleased with a Sin, because he
sees his Neighbour commit it, he must
have had such a long Acquaintance with
it himself, as to create a kind of Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:107166:130"/>
or Friendship, between him and
That; and then, we know, a Man is
Naturally glad to see his Old friend, not
only at his own House, but wheresoever
he meets him. It is generally the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of an Old Sinner to find a delight
in re-viewing his own Villainies in the
Practice of other Men; to see his Sin,
and himself (as it were) in Reversion;
and to find a greater satisfaction in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
him, who succeeds him in his
Vice, than him, who is to succeed him
in his Estate. In the matter of Sin, Age
makes a greater Change upon the Soul,
than it does, or can, upon the Body.
And as in this, if we compare the
Picture of a Man, drawn at the Years of
Seventeen, or Eighteen, with the Picture
of the same person at Threescore and
Ten, hardly the least Trace or Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of one Face can be found in the
other. So for the Soul, the Difference
of the Dispositions, and Qualities of the
Inner Man, will be found much greater.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:107166:131"/>
Compare the Harmlesness, the Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
the Tenderness, the Modesty, and
the Ingenuous pliableness to vertuous
Counsels, which is in Youth, as it comes
fresh and untainted out of the hands of
Nature, with the Mischievousness, the
Slyness, the Craft, the Impudence, the
Falshood, and the confirmed Obstinacy
in most sorts of Sin, that is to be found
in an aged, long-practised Sinner, and
you will confess the Complexion and
Hue of his Soul, to be altered more than
that of his Face. Age has given him
another Body, and Custom another
Mind. All those Seeds of Vertue, and
good Morality, that were the Natural
Endowments of our first Years, are lost,
and dead for ever. And in respect of
the Native Innocence of Childhood, no
man, through <hi>Old Age,</hi> becomes <hi>twice a
Child.</hi> The Vices of Old Age have in
them the stiffness of it too. And as it
is the unfittest Time to <hi>learn in,</hi> so the
unfitness of it to <hi>unlearn</hi> will be found
much greater.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:107166:131"/>
Which Considerations, joyned with
that of its Imbecillity, make it the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Season for a super-annuated Sinner
to enjoy the Delights of Sin in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound;
and to supply the Impotence
of Practice by the airy, phantastick Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Memory and Reflection. For
all that can be allowed him now, is to
refresh his decrepit, effete Sensuality,
with the Transcript and History of his
former Life, recognized, and read over
by him, in the vitious Rants of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
youthfull Debauchees of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time, whom (with an odd kind of
Passion, mixed of Pleasure, and Envy
too) he sees flourishing in all the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and prime of their Age and Vice.
An old Wrestler loves to look on, and
to be near the Lists, though <hi>Feebleness</hi>
will not let him offer at the Prize. An
old Huntsman finds a Musick in the
Noise of Hounds, though he cannot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Chace. An old Drunkard loves
a Tavern, though he cannot go to it,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:107166:132"/>
but as he is supported, and led by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
just as some are observed to come
from thence. And an old Wanton, will
be doating upon Women, when he can
scarce see them without Spectacles. And
to shew the true Love and faithfull Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
that the Old Servants and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Vice ever after bear to it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more usual, and frequent, than
to hear, that such, as have been Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
in their Youth, turn Procurers in
their Age. Their great Concern is, that
the Vice may still go on.</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> A fourth Cause of men's taking
pleasure in the Sins of others, is, from
that meanness, and poor-spiritedness, that
naturally and inseparably accompanies
all Guilt. Whosoever is conscious to
himself of Sin, feels in himself (whether
he will own it or no) a proportionable
Shame, and a secret Depression of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
thereupon. And this is so irksome,
and uneasie to Man's mind, that he is
restless to relieve, and rid himself from
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:107166:132"/>
it: For which, he finds no way so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
as to get Company in the same
Sin. For Company, in any Action,
gives both Credit to that, and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to the Agent; and so much as
the Sinner gets of this, so much he casts
off of Shame. Singularity in Sin puts
it out of fashion; since to be alone in
any Practice, seems to make the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World against it; but the
Concurrence of others is a Tacit Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of that, in which they concurr.
Solitude is a kind of Nakedness, and the
Result of that, we know, is Shame. 'Tis
Company only that can bear a Man out
in an ill Thing; and he who is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
and fight the Law, will be sure
to need a <hi>Second.</hi> No wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if some take delight in the Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities,
and Baseness of others; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can support their Minds drooping,
and sneaking, and inwardly reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, from a sense of their own
guilt, but to see others as bad as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:107166:133"/>
To be Vitious amongst the Vertuous,
is a double disgrace and misery; but
where the whole Company is vitious,
and debauched, they presently like, or
<hi>at least easily pardon one another.</hi> And, as
it is observed by some, that there is
none so homely, but loves a Looking-glass;
so it is certain, that there is no
man so vicious, but delights to see the
Image of his Vice reflected upon him,
from one who exceeds, or at least equals
him in the same.</p>
            <p>Sin in it self, is not only shamefull,
but also weak; and it seeks a Remedy
for both in Society: For it is this, that
must give it both Colour and Support.
But, on the contrary, how great and (as
I may so speak) how Self-sufficient a
thing is Vertue! It needs no Credit from
Abroad, no Countenance from the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.
Were there but one vertuous
man in the World, he would hold up
his Head with Confidence, and Honour:
He would shame the World, and not the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107166:133"/>
World him. For, according to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and great Saying, <hi>Prov. 14. 14.
A good Man shall be satisfied from himself.</hi>
He needs look no further. But if he
desires to see the same Vertue propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and diffused to those about him; it
is for their sakes, not his own. It is his
Charity that wishes, and not his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
that requires it. For Solitude and
Singularity can neither daunt, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
him; unless we could suppose it
a disgrace for a man to be singularly
good.</p>
            <p>But a vicious Person, like the basest
sort of Beasts, never enjoys himself, but
in the Herd. Company, he thinks, les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens
the shame of Vice, by sharing it;
and abates the Torrent of a common
Odium, by deriving it into many Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels;
And therefore, if he cannot wholly
avoid the Eye of the Observer, he hopes
to distract it at least by a multiplicity
of the Object. These, I confess, are
poor Shifts, and miserable Shelters, for
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:107166:134"/>
a Sick and a Self-upbraiding Conscience
to fly to; and yet they are some of the
best, that the Debauchee has to chear up
his Spirits with in this World. For, if
after all, he must needs be seen, and
took notice of, with all his Filth and
Noisomeness about him, he promises
himself however, that it will be some
allay to his Reproach, to be but one of
many, to march in a Troop, and by
a preposterous kind of <hi>Ambition, to be
seen in bad Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The fifth and last Cause (that I
shall mention) inducing Men to take
pleasure in the Sins of others, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
peculiar, unaccountable Malignity,
that is in some Natures and Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
I know no other Name, or
Word, to express it by. But the thing
it self is frequently seen in the Temporal
Concerns of this World. For, are there
not some who find an inward, secret
Rejoycing in themselves, when they see,
or hear, of the loss, or calamity of their
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:107166:134"/>
Neighbour, though no imaginable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
or Advantage of their own, is,
or can be, served thereby? But (it
seems) there is a base, Wolvish Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
within, that is fed, and gratified with
another's Misery; and no other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
or Reason in the World can be
given of its being so, but that it is <hi>the
Nature of the Beast</hi> to delight in such
things.</p>
            <p>And as this occurrs frequently in
Temporals, so there is, no doubt, but
that with some few persons, it acts the
same way also in Spirituals. I say, with
some few persons; for, thanks be to
God, the common, known Corruption
of humane Nature, upon the bare stock
of its Original Depravation, does not
usually proceed so far. Such an one,
for instance, was that Wretch, who
made a poor Captive renounce his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
in order to the saving of his Life;
and, when he had so done, presently
run him through, glorying, that he had
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:107166:135"/>
thereby destroyed his Enemy, both Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Soul. But more remarkably
such, was that Monster of Diabolical
Baseness here in <hi>England,</hi> who, some
years since, in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi>
the First, suffered Death for Crimes
scarce ever heard of before; having fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
boasted, that as several Men had
their several Pleasures and Recreations,
so his peculiar Pleasure and Recreation
was to <hi>destroy Souls,</hi> and accordingly to
put men upon such Practices as he knew
would assuredly doe it. But above all,
the late Saying of some of the Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Brotherhood ought to be proclaimed
and celebrated to their Eternal Honour:
who, while there was another New Oath
preparing, which they both supposed
and hoped most of the Clergy would
not take, in a most insulting manner
gave out thereupon; <hi>That they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
either to have our Livings, or to
Damn our Souls.</hi> An Expression, so
fraught with all the Spight and Poyson
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:107166:135"/>
which the Devil himself could infuse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Words, that it ought to remain as a
Monument of the Humanity, Charity
and Christianity of this sort of men for
ever.</p>
            <p>Now such a Temper or Principle, as
these, and the like Passages doe import,
I call a <hi>peculiar Malignity of Nature;</hi>
since it is evident, that neither the inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Love of Vice, nor yet the long
Practice of it, and that even against the
Reluctancies, and Light of Conscience,
can of it self have this devilish effect
upon the Mind, but as it falls in with
such a villainous, preter-natural Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
as I have mentioned. For to
instance in the Particular Case of Parents
and Children, let a Father be never so
Vitious, yet, generally speaking, he
would not have his Child so. Nay,
it is certain, that some, who have
been as corrupt in their Morals, as
Vice could make them, have yet
been infinitely solicitous, to have
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:107166:136"/>
their Children soberly, vertuously, and
piously brought up: So that, although
they have <hi>begot Sons after their own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
yet they are not willing to <hi>breed</hi>
them so too.</p>
            <p>Which, by the way, is the most preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
demonstration in the World, of that
Self-condemning Sentence, that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
sounding in every great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's
Breast; and of that inward, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
dislike of the very thing he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that he should abhorr to see the
same in any one, whose Good he nearly
tenders, and whose Person he wishes
well to. But if now, on the other side,
we should chance to find a Father cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
his Son, or a Mother debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Daughter, as (God knows such
Monsters have been seen within the four
Seas) we must not charge this barely
upon an high Predominance of Vice in
these persons, but much more upon a
peculiar Anomaly, and Baseness of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
If the Name of <hi>Nature</hi> may be
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:107166:136"/>
allowed to that which seems to be an
utter cashiering of it; a Deviation from,
and a Contradiction to the common
Principles of Humanity. For this is
such a Disposition, as strips the <hi>Father</hi>
of the <hi>Man;</hi> as makes him <hi>Sacrifice his
Children to Molech;</hi> and as much out-do
the cruelty of a <hi>Cannibal,</hi> or a <hi>Saturn,</hi>
as it is more barbarous, and unhumane
to <hi>damn</hi> a Child than to <hi>devour</hi> him.
We sometimes read and hear of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
<hi>Births,</hi> but we may often see a
greater Monstrosity in <hi>Educations;</hi> thus,
when a Father has begot a Man, he
trains him up into a Beast. Making
even his own House a Stews, a Bordell,
and a School of Lewdness, to instill the
Rudiments of Vice into the unwary,
flexible years of his poor Children,
poisoning their tender minds with the
irresistible, authentick Venom of his base
Example; so that all the Instruction
they find within their Father's Walls,
shall be only to be disciplined to an
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:107166:137"/>
earlier Practice of Sin, to be <hi>catechised</hi>
into all the Mysteries of Iniquity, and,
at length, <hi>confirmed</hi> in a mature, grown
up, incorrigible state of Debauchery.
And this some Parents call a teaching
their Children <hi>to know the World,</hi> and to
<hi>study Men:</hi> Thus leading them (as it
were) by the hand, through all the
Forms and Classes, all the Varieties and
Modes of Villainy, till at length they
make them ten times more the Children
of the <hi>Devil,</hi> than of <hi>themselves.</hi> Now,
I say, if the unparallell'd Wickedness of
the Age should at any time cast us upon
such blemishes of Mankind as these,
who, while they thus treat their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
should abuse, and usurp the Name
of <hi>Parents,</hi> by assuming it to themselves;
let us not call them by the low, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive
Term or Title of <hi>Sinfull, Wicked,</hi>
or <hi>Ungodly</hi> Men; but let us look upon
them as so many prodigious Exceptions
from our Common Nature, as so many
portentous Animals, like the strange,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:107166:137"/>
unnatural Productions of <hi>Africa,</hi> and
fit to be <hi>publickly shewn,</hi> were they not
unfit to <hi>be seen.</hi> For certainly, where
a Child finds his own Parents, his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters,
he cannot be so properly said
to be <hi>Born,</hi> as to be <hi>Damned into the
World;</hi> and better were it for him by
far to have been <hi>unborn,</hi> and <hi>unbegot,</hi>
than to come to <hi>ask blessing</hi> of those
whose Conversation breaths nothing but
Contagion and a <hi>Curse.</hi> So impossible,
and so much a Paradox is it, for any
Parent to impart to his Child his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and his Vice too.</p>
            <p>And thus I have dispatched the <hi>first
general thing</hi> proposed for the handling
of the Words, and shewn in five seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Particulars, <hi>What it is, that brings a
man to such a disposition of Mind, as to take
pleasure in other men's Sins.</hi> I proceed
now to the</p>
            <p>II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Which is, <hi>To shew the Reasons, why a
man's being disposed to doe so, comes to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with such an extraordinary Guilt.</hi> And
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:107166:138"/>
the First shall be taken from this, That
naturally there is no Motive to induce
or tempt a man to this way of Sinning.
And this is a most certain Truth, That
the lesser the Temptation is, the greater
is the Sin. For, in every Sin, by how
much the more free the Will is in its
Choice, by so much is the Act the more
Sinfull. <hi>And,</hi> where there is nothing to
importune, urge, or provoke it to any
Act, there is so much an higher, and
perfecter degree of Freedom, about that
Act. For albeit, the Will is not capable
of being compelled to any of its Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
yet it is capable of being made to
Act with more or less Difficulty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different Impressions it
receives from Motives, or Objects. If
the Object be extremely pleasing, and
apt to gratifie it; there, though the Will
has still a power of Refusing it, yet it
is not without some Difficulty. Upon
which account it is, that Men are so
strongly carried out to, and so hardly
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:107166:138"/>
took off from the Practice of Vice;
namely, because the sensual pleasure ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>from it,</hi> is still importuning and
drawing them <hi>to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, from whence springs this
pleasure? Is it not from the gratification
of some Desire founded in Nature? An
irregular gratification it is indeed very
often; yet still the foundation of it is,
and must be, something Natural: So
that the Summ of all is this, That the
Naturalness of a Desire, is the Cause
that the Satisfaction of it is Pleasure,
and Pleasure importunes the Will; and
that which importunes the Will, puts a
Difficulty in the Will's refusing or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
it. Thus Drunkenness is an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
satisfaction of the Appetite of
Thirst; Uncleanness an unlawfull Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the Appetite of Procreation;
and Covetousness a boundless, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
pursuit of the Principle of Self-preservation.
So that all these are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in some Natural desire, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:107166:139"/>
pleasurable, and upon that account
tempt, solicite and entice the Will. In
a word; there is hardly any one Vice
or Sin of direct and personal Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but what is the Irregularity and
Abuse of one of those two grand Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Principles; namely, Either that which
inclines a Man to <hi>preserve himself,</hi> or
that which inclines him to <hi>please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, what Principle, Faculty or
Desire, by which Nature projects either
its own <hi>pleasure,</hi> or <hi>preservation,</hi> is, or
can be gratified by another man's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
pursuit of his own Vice? It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that all the pleasure, that <hi>naturally</hi>
can be received from a vicious Action,
can immediately, and personally affect
none but him who does it; for it is an
Application of the pleasing Object only
to his own Sense; and no man feels by
another man's Senses. And therefore the
delight, that a man takes from another's
Sin, can be nothing else but a phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107166:139"/>
preter-natural Complacency ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from that, which he has really no
sense or feeling of. It is properly a
love of Vice, as such; a delighting in
Sin for its own sake; and is a direct
Imitation, or rather an Exemplification
of the Malice of the Devil; who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in seeing those Sins committed,
which the very Condition of his Nature
renders him uncapable of committing
himself. For the Devil can neither
Drink, nor Whore, nor play the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
though he enjoys the Pleasures of
all these at a second hand, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Approbation. If a man plays
the Thief (says <hi>Solomon) and steals to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his Hunger,</hi> Prov. 6. 30. Though
it cannot wholly excuse the Fact, yet it
sometimes extenuates the Guilt. And,
we know, there are some corrupt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in the Soul of Man, that urge,
and push him on, to their satisfaction,
with such an impetuous fury, that, when
we see a man over-born and run down
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:107166:140"/>
by them, considering the frailty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, we cannot but pity the
Person, while we abhorr the Crime. It
being like one ready to drink Poison,
rather than to die with Thirst.</p>
            <p>But when a man shall with a sober,
sedate, diabolical Rancour, look upon
and enjoy himself in the sight of his
Neighbour's Sin and Shame, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
hug himself upon the Ruins of
his Brother's Vertue, and the Dishonours
of his Reason, can he plead the Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any Appetite in Nature enclining
him to this? And that would otherwise
render him uneasie to himself, should
he not thus triumph in another's folly
and confusion? No, certainly; this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be so much as pretended. For he
may as well carry his Eyes in another
man's Head, and run Races with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man's Feet, as directly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
tast the Pleasures, that spring from
the Gratification of another man's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:107166:140"/>
Nor can that Person, whosoever he is,
who accounts it his Recreation and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
to see <hi>one man</hi> wallowing in his
filthy Revels, and another made infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and noisome by his Sensuality,
be so impudent, as to alledge for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his so doing, That either all the
enormous Draughts of the one, doe or
can leave the least Relish upon the Tip
of his Tongue; or, that all the Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Whoredoms of the other, doe
or can quench, or cool the boilings of
his own Lust. No; this is impossible.
And if so, what can we then assign for
the Cause of this monstrous Disposition?
Why, all that can be said in this case, is,
that Nature proceeds by quite another
method; having given Men such and
such Appetites, and allotted to each of
them their respective Pleasures; the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,</hi>
and the <hi>Pleasure,</hi> still co-habiting
in the same Subject; But the Devil and
long Custom of Sinning have super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced
upon the Soul, new, unnatural,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:107166:141"/>
and absurd Desires; Desires, that have
no real Object; Desires, that relish
things not at all desirable; but, like
the sickness and distemper of the Soul,
feeding only upon Filth and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Fire and Brimstone, and giving a
Man the Devil's Nature, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
Delight; who has no other Joy or
Happiness, but to dishonour his Maker,
and to destroy his Fellow-creature; to
Corrupt him here, and to Torment him
hereafter. In fine, there is as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the pleasure a Man
takes in his own Sins, and that which
he takes in other men's, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Wickedness of a Man, and
the Wickedness of a Devil.</p>
            <p>2. A second Reason why a man's
taking pleasure in the Sins of others,
comes to be attended with such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Guilt, is from the boundless,
unlimited Nature of this way of Sinning.
For by this a man contracts a kind of
an Universal Guilt, and (as it were)
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:107166:141"/>
Sins over the Sins of all other Men; so
that while the <hi>Act</hi> is theirs, the <hi>Guilt</hi> of
it is equally his: Consider any man as
to his personal Powers, and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Sinning, and comparatively, they
are not great; for at greatest they must
still be limited by the measure of Man's
Actings, and the term of his Duration.
And a Man's active Powers are but
weak, and his Continuance in the World
but short. So that Nature is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to keep pace with his Corruptions,
by answering Desire with proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Practice.</p>
            <p>For to instance in those two grand
Extravagances of <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness:</hi>
Surely no man is of so general and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusive
a Lust, as to prosecute his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
all the World over; and let it
burn never so out-rageously for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
yet Age will in time chill those
Heats; and the impure Flame will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
die of it self, or consume the Body
that harbours it. And so for Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:107166:142"/>
in Drinking; no man can be so
much a Swine, as to be always pouring
in, but in the compass of some years
he will drown his Health and his Strength
in his own Belly; and after all his Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Trophies, at length <hi>Drink down</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
too; and that certainly will, and
must, put an end to the Debauch.</p>
            <p>But now, for the way of Sinning,
which we have been speaking of, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confined by Place, nor weakned by
Age; But the Bed-rid, the Gouty, and
the Lethargick, may, upon this account,
equal the Activity of the strongest, and
most vegete Sinner. Such an one may
take his Brother by the Throat, and act
the Murtherer, even while he can neither
stir an hand, nor a foot; and he may
invade his Neighbour's Bed, while Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
has tied him down to his own. He
may sin over all the Adulteries and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches,
all the Frauds and Oppressions
of the whole Neighbourhood, and (as
I may so speak) he may break every
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:107166:142"/>
Command of God's Law by Proxy,
and it were well for him, if he could
be damned by Proxy too. A man, by
Delight and Fancy, may grasp in the
Sins of all Countries, and Ages, and by
an inward liking of them communicate
in their Guilt. He may take a Range
all the World over, and draw in all
that wide Circumference of Sin and
Vice, and center it in his own Breast.
For, whatsoever Sin a man extremely
loves, and would commit, if he had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and, in the mean time, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
himself with the Speculation of the
same, whether ever he commits it, or
no, it leaves a stain and a guilt upon his
Conscience; and, according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
and severe Accounts of the Law,
is made, in a great Respect, his own. So
that by this means there is a kind of
Transmigration of Sins, much like that,
which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> held of Souls. Such
an one, to be sure, it is, as makes a man
not only (according to the Apostle's
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:107166:143"/>
phrase) a <hi>Partaker of other men's Sins,</hi>
but also a Deriver of the whole, entire
Guilt of them to himself; and yet so,
as to leave the Committer of them, as
full of Guilt, as he was before.</p>
            <p>From whence we see the infinitely
fruitfull, and productive Power of this
way of Sinning; how it can encrease
and multiply beyond all Bounds and
Measures of Actual Commission, and
how vastly it swells the Sinner's Account
in an instant. So that a man shall out
of all the various, and even numberless
kinds of Villainy, acted by all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Nations round about him (as
it were) extract one mighty, Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
guilt, and adopt it to himself;
and so become chargeable with, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
for <hi>a World of Sin</hi> without a
Figure.</p>
            <p>3. The third and last Reason that I
shall assign, of the extraordinary Guilt,
attending a man's being disposed to take
pleasure in other men's Sins, shall be
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:107166:143"/>
taken from the Soul's preparation, and
passage to such a disposition. For, that
it pre-supposes and includes in it the
Guilt of many preceding Sins. For (as
it has been shown) a man must have
pass'd many Periods of Sin, before he
can arrive to it; and have served a long
Apprenticeship to the Devil, before he
can come to such a perfection, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
in Vice, as this imports. It is a
Collection of the Guilt of a long and
numerous Train of Villainies, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium
and Summ-Total of several
particular Impieties, all united and <hi>cast
up</hi> into one. It is (as it were) the very
Quintessence, and Sublimation of Vice,
by which (as in the Spirit of Liquors)
the Malignity of many Actions is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
into a little compass, but with a
greater advantage of strength and force,
by such a Contraction.</p>
            <p>In a word, it is the Wickedness of a
whole Life, discharging all its filth and
foulness into this one Quality, as into a
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:107166:144"/>
great Sink, or Common Shore. So that
nothing is, or can be, so properly and
significantly called the <hi>very Sinfulness of
Sin,</hi> as this. And therefore no wonder,
if containing so many years guilt in the
Bowels of it, it stands here stigmatized
by the Apostle, as a Temper of Mind,
rendring Men so detestably bad, that the
Great Enemy of Mankind, the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
neither can, nor desires to make them
worse. I cannot, I need not say any
more of it. It is indeed a Condition,
not to be thought of (by Persons serious
enough to think and consider) without
the utmost Horror. But such as truly
fear God, shall both be kept from it, and
from those Sins that lead to it.</p>
            <p>To which God, infinitely Wise, Holy and
Iust, be rendred and ascribed, as is
most due, all Praise, Might, Majesty,
and Dominion, both now and for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
<hi>Amen.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Guilt arising from a Man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting,
or taking pleasure in other men's
Sins, or, (which is all one) in other men

in his own Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prosecution of which, I stated
upon these Three things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> To shew what it is that brings
a man to such a Disposition of Mind,
as to take pleasure in other men's Sins.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:107166:146"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To shew the Reasons why
a man's being disposed to doe so, comes
to be attended with such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> To declare what
kind of Persons are to be reckoned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Character.</p>
            <p>The Two first of which being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
already, I proceed now to the
<hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Last.</hi> Concerning which, I
shall lay down this general Assertion;
<hi>That whosoever draws others to Sin, ought
to be lookt upon, as one delighting in those
Sins, that he draws them to.</hi> For as much,
as no man is brought to doe any thing,
especially if it be ill, or wicked, but in
order to the pleasing of himself by it:
It being absurd and incredible, that any
one should venture to damn himself
hereafter, for that, which does not some
way or other gratifie and please him
here. But to draw forth this General
into Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:107166:146"/>
1. First of all: <hi>Those are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to take pleasure in other men's Sins,
who teach Doctrines, directly tending to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
such, as believe them in a sinfull Course.</hi>
For, there is none so compendious and
efficacious a way to prepare a man for
all Sin, as this: This being properly to
put out the Eyes of that which is to be
his Guide, by perverting his Judgment;
and when that is once done, you may
carry him whither you will. Chance
must be his Rule, and present Appetite
his Director. A man's Judgment, or
Conscience, is the great Spring of all
his Actions; and consequently, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
or pervert this, is to derive a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion
upon all that he does. And
therefore, we see, how high a Guilt our
Saviour charges upon this; in <hi>Matth. 5.
19. Whosoever shall break one of these least
Commandments, and shall teach men so, shall
be called the least in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
That is, in Truth shall never come
thither. And we find, the great Sin of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:107166:147"/>
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> was, that they promoted
and abetted the Sins of other Men,
taught the Devil's Doctrine out of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s
Chair, and by false Descants upon
the Divine Precepts, cut asunder the
binding force of them. So that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their wretched Comments,
Men might break the Law, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sin against it. For, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 5, 6.
they had taught Men how <hi>to dishonour
their Parents,</hi> without any Violation of
the Fifth Commandment. Thus they
preached: And what design can any
one imagine the Authors of such Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
could have, but the Depravation
of men's Manners! For, if some Men
teach wicked Things, it must be, that
others should practise them. And, if
one Man sets another a Copy, it is, no
doubt, with a purpose, that he should
write after it.</p>
            <p>Now these Doctrines are of Two
sorts.</p>
            <p>1. Such as represent Actions, that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:107166:147"/>
are in themselves really wicked, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as not so.</p>
            <p>2. Such as represent them much less
sinfull as to their kind or degrees, than
indeed they are.</p>
            <p>For the first of which; To instance
in one very gross one, instead of many,
take the Doctrine of those, commonly
called <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who assert positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That <hi>Believers,</hi> or <hi>Persons regenerate,
and within the Covenant of Grace, cannot
Sin.</hi> Upon which account, no wonder,
if some very liberally assume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Condition and Character of
Believers; for then they know, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mighty Privilege belongs to them
of course. But what? may not these
<hi>Believers</hi> Cheat and Lye, commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Steal, Murther, and Rebel? Why,
yes: they may; and nothing is more
common, than to see such <hi>Believers</hi> doe
such things. But how then, can they
escape the Charge of all that Guilt, that
Naturally follows from such Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:107166:148"/>
Why, thus; you must in this case
with great Care and Accuracy distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
between the <hi>Act</hi> of Lying, and
the <hi>Sin</hi> of Lying; the <hi>Act</hi> of Stealing,
and the <hi>Sin</hi> of Stealing; and the <hi>Act</hi> of
Rebellion, and the <hi>Sin</hi> of Rebellion.
Now, though all these <hi>Acts</hi> are frequent
and usual with such persons, yet they
are sure (as they order the matter) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be guilty of the <hi>Sin.</hi> And the
Reason is, because it is not the <hi>Quality</hi>
of the Action that derives a Qualification
upon the Person, so as to render him
such or such, good or bad; but it is
the Antecedent Quality or Condition of
the Person that denominates his Actions,
and stamps them Good or Evil. So
that they are those only who are first
wicked, that doe wicked Actions. But
Believers, and the <hi>Godly,</hi> though they
doe the very same things, yet they so
much out-wit the Devil, in the doing of
them, that they never commit the same
Sins. But, you will say, how came
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:107166:148"/>
they by such a great, and strange Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege?
Why; they will tell you, it is,
<hi>because they are not under the obliging
Power of the Law.</hi> And if you ask fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
How they come to get from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that common Obligation that lies
so hard and heavy upon all the rest of
the World? They will tell you, it is
from this, That <hi>Believers, instead of the
Law, have the Spirit actually dwelling in
them,</hi> and by an admirable kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
<hi>Clock-work</hi> moving them, just as
a Spring does a Watch; and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
by himself alone, without the
Mediation of any <hi>written Law,</hi> or <hi>Rule,</hi>
to guide, or direct, and much less to
command, or oblige them. So that the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> we see, is to be their sole Director
without, and very often contrary to the
written <hi>Law.</hi> An excellent Contrivance,
doubtless, to authorize and sanctifie the
blackest, and most flagitious Actions,
that can proceed from Man. For, since
the Motions of the Spirit (which they
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:107166:149"/>
so confidently suppose themselves to
have) cannot so much as in things
Good and Lawfull, by any certain Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agnostick,
be distinguished from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Man's own Heart, they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
easily make a step further, and even
in things unlawfull, conclude the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their own Hearts to be the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
of the Spirit; and this presently
alters the whole Complexion of an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that would otherwise look but very
scurvily; and makes it absolutely pure,
and unblameable, or rather perfect and
meritorious. So that, let a Man have
but Impudence, and Wickedness enough
to Libel his Maker, and to entitle the
<hi>Spirit of God</hi> to all that he does, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
Sur-naming his own Inclinations
and Appetites (though never so irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and impure) the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and
you may, upon very sure grounds, turn
him loose, and bid him <hi>Sin</hi> if he can.
And thus much for the first sort of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines,
which once believed, like the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:107166:149"/>
Floud-gates of Hell pulled up, lets in a
Deluge and Inundation of all Sin and
Vice upon the Lives of Men. And if
this be the Natural <hi>effect</hi> of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
themselves, we cannot, in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but inferr, that the Interest of the
Teachers of them must needs be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>2. The other sort of Doctrines, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to engage such as believe them in a
sinfull Course, are such as represent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sins, <hi>much less</hi> as to their <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi>
than indeed they are. Of which
Number is that Doctrine, that asserts all
Sins committed by Believers, or Persons
in a state of Grace, to be but Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
That there are such things as Sins
of <hi>Infirmity,</hi> in Contra-distinction to
those of a <hi>Presumption,</hi> is a Truth not
to be questioned; but in <hi>Hypothesi,</hi> to
state exactly which are Sins of <hi>Infirmity,</hi>
and which are not, is not so easie a
work. This is certain, that there is a
vast difference between them; indeed,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:107166:150"/>
as vast as between <hi>Inadvertency,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,</hi>
between <hi>Surprize</hi> and <hi>Set-pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:</hi>
And that Persons truly regenerate
have sinn'd this latter way, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
may sin so again, is as evident
as the Story (already referr'd to by us)
of <hi>David</hi>'s Murther and Adultery. Sins
acted not only with deliberation, but
with artifice, study, and deep contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.
And, can Sins, that carry such
dismal Marks, and black Symptoms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, pass for <hi>Infirmities?</hi> For Sins of
daily Incursion, and such as humane
Frailty, and the very Condition of our
Nature in this World; is so unavoidably
liable to, (for so are Sins of Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
that a <hi>Righteous Man may fall into
them seven times in a day;</hi> and yet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the mercifull Tenor of the
Covenant of Grace, stand accepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God as a Righteous Man still? No,
certainly, if such are <hi>Infirmities,</hi> it will
be hard to assign what are <hi>Presumptions.</hi>
And what a Sin-encouraging Doctrine
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:107166:150"/>
that is, that avouches them for such, is
sufficiently manifest from hence, That,
<hi>although</hi> every Sin of Infirmity, in its
own Nature, and according to the strict
Rigour of the Law, merits Eternal
Death; yet it is certain from the Gospel,
that no man shall actually suffer Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Death barely for Sins of <hi>Infirmity.</hi>
Which being so, perswade but a man
that a Regenerate person may Cheat
and Lye, Steal, Murther and Rebel, by
way of <hi>Infirmity,</hi> and at the same time,
you perswade him also, that he may
doe all this without any danger of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
And then, since these are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
such desirable Privileges to
<hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Bloud;</hi> and since withall, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man by Nature is so very prone to
think the best of himself, and of his own
Condition; it is odds, but he will find
a shrewd Temptation to believe himself
<hi>Regenerate,</hi> rather than forbear a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable,
or a profitable Sin, by thinking
that he shall go to Hell for committing
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:107166:151"/>
it. Now this being such a direct Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuduction
to all kind of Sin, by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Conscience with under-valuing
Perswasions, concerning the Malignity
and Guilt even of the foulest; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that such as teach and promote
the belief of such Doctrines, are to be
lookt upon as the Devil's Prophets and
Apostles; and there is no doubt, but
the guilt of every Sin, that either from
Pulpit, or from Press, they influence
Men to the Commission of, does as
certainly rest upon them, and will one
day be as severely exacted of them, as
if they had actually and personally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it themselves.</p>
            <p>And thus I have instanced in two
notable Doctrines, that may justly be
lookt upon as the General In-letts, or
Two great Gates, through which all
Vice and Villainy rush in upon the
Manners of Men professing Religion.
But the <hi>Particulars,</hi> into which these <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals</hi>
diffuse themselves, you may look
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:107166:151"/>
for, and find in those well-furnished Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines
and Store-houses of all Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
and Baseness, the Books and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of some Modern Casuists; who,
like the Devil's <hi>Amanuenses,</hi> and Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to the Prince of Darkness, have
published to the World, such Notions
and Intrigues of Sin, out of his Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
as neither the Wit, or Wickedness
of Man, upon the bare natural Stock
either of Invention or Corruption, could
ever have found out.</p>
            <p>The Writings, both of the Old and
New Testament, make it very difficult
for a Man to be <hi>saved;</hi> but the Writings
of these Men make it more difficult, if
not impossible, for any one to be <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi>
For, where there is no Sin, there
can be no Damnation. And, as these
Men have obscured and confounded the
Natures and Properties of things by
their false Principles, and wretched So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry,
though an Act be never so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
they will be sure to strip it of its
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:107166:152"/>
Guilt; and to make the very <hi>Law</hi> and
<hi>Rule</hi> of Action so <hi>pliable</hi> and <hi>bending,</hi>
that it shall be impossible to be <hi>broke.</hi>
So that he, who goes to Hell, must pass
through a <hi>narrower Gate</hi> than that, which
the Gospel says, leads to <hi>Heaven.</hi> For
that, we are told, is only <hi>strait,</hi> but this
is absolutely <hi>shut;</hi> and so shut, that <hi>Sin</hi>
cannot pass it, and therefore it is much
if a <hi>Sinner</hi> should.</p>
            <p>So insufferably have these Impostors
poysoned the Fountains of Morality,
perverted and embased the very Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
and distinguishing Rule of Good
and Evil. So that all their Books and
Writings are but Debauchery upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and Impiety registred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
over to Posterity.</p>
            <p>In every Volumn there is a Nursery
and Plantation of Vice, where it is sure
to thrive, and from thence to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
into men's Practice. For, here
it is manured with Art and Argument,
sheltred with Fallacy and Distinction,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:107166:152"/>
and thereby enabled both to annoy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and to defend it self.</p>
            <p>And to shew how far the Malignity
of this way of Sinning reaches; He,
who has vented a pernicious Doctrine,
or published an ill Book, must know,
that his Guilt, and his Life, determine
not together: No, such an one (as
the Apostle says) <hi>being dead, yet speaketh;</hi>
He sins in his very Grave, corrupts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
while he is rotting himself, and
has a growing Account in the other
World, after he has paid Nature's last
Debt in this; And, in a word, quits
this Life like a Man carried off by the
Plague; who, though he dyes himself,
yet does Execution upon others by a
surviving Infection.</p>
            <p>2. Such also are to be <hi>reckoned to
take pleasure in other men's Sins, as endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
by all means, to allure Men to Sin;</hi>
And that either by formal Persuasion,
Importunity, or Desire, as we find the
Harlot described, enticing the Young
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:107166:153"/>
man, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. from <hi>ver.</hi> 13. to 22.
Or else by administring Objects and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
fit to enflame and draw forth
a man's corrupt Affections; such as are
the Drinking of a cholerick, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull
Person into a fit of Rage
and Violence against the Person of his
Neighbour; thus heating one man's
Blood, in order to the shedding of
another's. Such also, as the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a lustfull, incontinent Person,
by filthy Discourse, wanton Books, and
Pictures, and, that which equals, and
exceeds them all, the Incentives of the
<hi>Stage;</hi> till a man's Vice and Folly works
over all Bounds, and grows at length
too mad, and out-ragious, to be either
governed or concealed.</p>
            <p>Now, with great variety of such kind

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:107166:153"/>
and their Manners, and getting
their very Bread by the Damnation of
Souls. So that if any inexperienced,
young Novice, happens into the fatal
Neighbourhood of such Pests, presently
they are upon him, plying his full Purse
and his empty Pate with Addresses suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Vanity; telling him, What
pity it is, that one so accomplish'd for
Parts and Person, should smother him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Country, where he can learn
nothing of Gallantry, or Behaviour; as,
how to make his Court, to hector a
Drawer, to cog the Dye, or storm a
Whore-house; but must of Necessity
live and dye ignorant of what it is to
Trapan, or be Trapann'd, to Sup, or
rather Dine at Mid-night in a Tavern,
with the Noise of Oaths, Blasphemies,
and Fidlers about his Ears, and to fight
every Watch and Constable at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from thence, and to be beaten by
them: But must at length, poor Man!
dye dully of Old age at home; when
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:107166:154"/>
here he might so fashionably and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilely,
long before that time, have been
Duell'd, or Flux'd into another World.</p>
            <p>If this be not the guise and practice
of the Times, especially as to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Cities of the Kingdom, let any
one judge; and whether for such a
poor, deluded Wretch, instead of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rusty in the Country, (as some
call it) to be thus brought by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Indigent, Debauched, Soul-and-Body-destroying
Harpies, to lose his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
Family, and Vertue, amongst them
in the City, be not a much greater Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the publick Weal and Justice
of any Government, than most of those
Crimes, that bring the Committers of
them to the Gallows, we may at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
easily see, and one day perhaps
sadly feel.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Trade of Corrupting the
young Gentry, and Nobility, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
them with the Vices of the Great
Town, as soon as they set foot into it,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:107166:154"/>
carried on secretly, and in a corner, but
openly, and in the face of the Sun; by
persons, who have formed themselves
into Companies, or rather Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
So that a Man may as easily know
where to find one, to teach him to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch,
Whore, Game, and Blaspheme,
as to teach him to Write, or Cast Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt:
'Tis their Support, and Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
nay, their very Profession, and
Livelihood; getting their Living by
those Practices, for which they deserve
to forfeit their Lives.</p>
            <p>Now these are another sort of Men,
who are justly charged with the Guilt
and Character of delighting in other
men's Sins: Men, who are the Devil's
Setters; who contrive, study, and beat
their Brains how to draw in some poor,
innocent, unguarded Heir into their Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Net, learning his Humour, prying
into his Circumstances, and observing
his Weak side; and all this to plant the
Snare, and apply the Temptation ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:107166:155"/>
and successfully; and when by
such Insinuations they have once got
with<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> him, and are able to drill him
on from one Lewdness to another, by
the same Arts corrupting, and squeezing
him as they please; no wonder, if they
rejoyce to see him guilty of all sorts of
Villainy, and take <hi>pleasure</hi> in those Sins,
in which they find their <hi>profit</hi> too.</p>
            <p>3. Such as affect the Company of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous,
and Vitious Persons, are also
to be reckoned in the Number of those
who take pleasure in such men's Vices.
For otherwise, what is there in such Men,
which they can pretend to be pleased
with! For generally such Sots have neither
Parts, nor Wit, Ingenuity of Discourse,
nor Fineness of Conversation, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
or delight any one, that coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Company, brings but his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
along with him. But, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
their rude, impertinent Loudness,
their Quarrels, their Nastiness, their dull,
obscene Talk, and Ribauldry, (which
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:107166:155"/>
from them you must take for <hi>Wit,</hi> or go
without it,) cannot but be very nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and offensive to any one, who does
not baulk his own Reason, out of love
to their Vice; and, for the sake of the
Sin it self, pardon the Ugliness of its
Circumstances: As a Father will hug
and embrace his beloved Son for all the
dirt and foulness of his Cloaths; the
dearness of the Person easily apologizing
for the disagreeableness of the Habit.</p>
            <p>One would think it should be no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
matter to bring any Man of Sense to
love an <hi>Alehouse;</hi> indeed of so much
sence, as <hi>seeing</hi> and <hi>smelling</hi> amounts to;
there being such strong Encounters of
both, as would quickly send him pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
did not the love of Good-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
reconcile him to these Nusances,
and the Deity he adored compound for
the Homeliness of its Shrine.</p>
            <p>It is clear therefore, that where a
Man can like and love the Conversation
of lewd, debauched Persons, amidst all
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:107166:156"/>
the Natural Grounds and Motives of
Loathing and Dislike; it can proceed
from nothing but the inward Affection
he bears to their lewd, debauched Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
It is this that he <hi>enjoys,</hi> and, for
the sake of this, the rest he <hi>endures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> Such as encourage,
countenance, and support Men in their
Sins, are to be reckoned in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those, who take pleasure in other
men's Sins. Now this may be done
Two ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By <hi>Commendation.</hi> Concerning
which, we may take this for granted;
That no Man commends another any
further than he likes him: For indeed to
commend any one, is to vouch him to
the World, to undertake for his Worth,
and, in a word, to own the Thing which
he is chiefly remarkable for. He who
writes an <hi>Encomium Neronis,</hi> if he does
it heartily, is Himself but a Transcript
of <hi>Nero</hi> in his Mind; And would (no
doubt) gladly enough see such Pranks,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:107166:156"/>
as he was famous for, acted again,
though he dares not be the Actor of
them himself.</p>
            <p>From whence we see the Reason of
some men's giving such Honourable
Names and Appellations to the worst
of Men and Actions, and base, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Titles to the best: Such as are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Faction,</hi> and a spitting in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's
face, <hi>Petitioning;</hi> Fanaticism, and
Schism, <hi>True Protestantism;</hi> Sacrilege and
Rapine, <hi>Thorough Reformation,</hi> and the
like. As, on the contrary, branding
Conformity to the Rules, and Rites of
the best Church in the World, with the
false and odious Name of <hi>Formality;</hi> and
traducing all Religious, Conscientious
Observers of them, as <hi>Mungrel Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
and <hi>Papists in Masquerade.</hi> And
indeed, many are, and have been,
called <hi>Papists</hi> of late years, whom those
very persons, who call them so, know
to be far from being so. But what then
do they mean, by fixing such false Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:107166:157"/>
upon men, even against their
own Consciences? Why, they mean and
design this: They would set such a Mark
upon those, whom they hate, as may
cause their Throats to be cut, and their
Estates to be seized upon, when the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
shall be let loose upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
once again; which such beggarly,
malicious Fellows impatiently hope, and
long for.</p>
            <p>Though, I doubt not, (how much
soever Knaves may abuse Fools with
Words for a Time,) but there will come
a Day, in which the most Active <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
will be found under the <hi>Puritan</hi>
Mask; and in which it will appear, that
the Conventicle has been the Jesuites sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Kennel, and the Papists themselves,
as well as the Fanaticks, have been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers
of all those monstrous Out-cries
against Popery, to the Ruine of those
Protestants whom they most hate, and
whom alone they fear. It being no
unheard of Trick for a Thief, when
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:107166:157"/>
he is closely pursued, to cry out, <hi>Stop
the Thief,</hi> and thereby diverting the
suspicion from himself, to get clear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
It is also worth our while to
consider with what Terms of Respect
and Commendation Knaves, and Sots
will speak of their own Fraternity. As,
<hi>What an honest, what a worthy Man is such
an one!</hi> And, <hi>What a Good-natur'd Person
is another!</hi> According to which Terms,
such as are Factious, by <hi>worthy Men,</hi> mean
only such as are of the same Faction, and
united in the same Designs against the
Government with themselves. And such
as are Brothers of the Pot, by a <hi>Good-natur'd
Person,</hi> mean only a true, trusty
Debauchee, who never stands out at a
Merry-meeting, so long as he is able to
stand at all; nor ever refuses an Health,
while he has enough of his own to
pledge it with; and, in a word, is as
<hi>honest,</hi> as Drunkenness and Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
want of <hi>Sence</hi> and <hi>Reason, Vertue</hi>
and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> can possibly make <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:107166:158"/>
2<hi>ly.</hi> The other way by which some
Men encourage others in their Sins, is
by <hi>Preferment.</hi> As, when Men shall be
advanced to Places of Trust and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for those Qualities, that render
them unworthy of so much as sober,
and civil Company. When a Lord, or
Master shall cast his Favours and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon such Beasts and Blemishes
of Society, as live only to the Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of him who made them, and the
Reproach of him who maintains them.
None certainly can love to see Vice in
Power, but such as love to see it also in
Practice. Place and Honour do of all
things most mis-become it; and a Goat,
or a Swine, in a Chair of State, cannot
be more odious, than ridiculous.</p>
            <p>It is reported of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that passing
through a certain Town, and seeing all
the Women of it standing at their Doors
with Monkeys in their Arms, he asked,
whether the Women of that Country
used to have any Children or no? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:107166:158"/>
wittily and sarcastically reproaching
them, for misplacing that Affection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Brutes, which could only become a
Mother to her Child. So, when we come
into a great Family, or Government,
and see this Place of Honour allotted to
a Murtherer, another filled with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist,
or Blasphemer, and a third with
a filthy Parasite, may we not as appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely,
and properly ask the Question,
Whether there be any such thing as Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
Sobriety, or Religion amongst such
a People, with whom Vice wears those
Rewards, Honours, and Privileges, which
in other Nations, the Common Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Reason awards only to the
Vertuous, the Sober, and Religious? And
certainly it is too flagrant a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
how much Vice is the Darling of
any People, when many amongst them
are preferred for those Practices, for
which, in other places, they can scarce be
pardoned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:107166:159"/>
And thus I have finished the <hi>Third</hi>
and <hi>Last</hi> General thing proposed, for the
handling of the Words, which was, To
<hi>shew the several Sorts, or Kinds of Men,
which fall under the Charge and Character
of taking pleasure in other Men's Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Inferences from the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Particulars shall be Twofold.</p>
            <p>1. Such as concern particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
And,</p>
            <p>2. Such as concern Communities or
Bodies of Men.</p>
            <p>And first for the Malignity of such a
disposition of Mind, as induces a Man
to delight in other men's Sins, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Effects of it upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Persons. As,</p>
            <p>1. It quite alters, and depraves the
Natural Frame of a man's Heart. For,
there is that Naturally in the Heart of
Man, which abhorrs Sin, as Sin; and
consequently, would make him detest it
both in himself, and in others too. The
first, and most genuine Principles of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:107166:159"/>
Reason are certainly averse to it, and
find a secret Grief and Remorse from
every invasion, that Sin makes upon a
man's Innocence; and that must needs
render the first Entrance and Admission
of Sin uneasie, because disagreeable. Yet
Time (we see) and Custom of Sinning
can bring a man to such a pass, that
it shall be more difficult and grievous
to him, to part with his Sin, than ever
it was to him, to admit it. It shall get
so far into, and lodge it self so deep
within his Heart, that it shall be his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and his Recreation, his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and his other Self; and the very
dividing between his Flesh, and his
Bones; or rather, between his Body and
his Soul, shall be less terrible and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to him, than to be took off from
his Vice.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, as Unnatural as this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Sin is, there is one yet more so: For,
that innate Principle of Self-love, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
easily, and often blinds a Man, as to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:107166:160"/>
any impartial Reflection upon himself;
yet, for the most part, leaves his Eyes
open enough, to judge truly of the same
thing in his Neighbour, and to hate that
in others, which he allows and cherishes
in himself. And therefore, when it shall
come to this, that he also approves, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
and delights in Sin, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
it, even in the Person and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of other Men: this shews, that the
Man is wholly transformed from the
Creature, that God first made him; nay,
that he has consumed those poor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of Good that the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi>
left him; that he has worn off the very
remote Dispositions, and Possibilities to
Vertue, and, in a word, turned Grace
first, and afterwards Nature it self out
of Doors. No man knows, at his first
Entrance upon any Sin, how far it may
carry him, and where it will stop; the
Commission of Sin being generally
like the <hi>pouring out of Water,</hi> which,
when once poured out, knows no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:107166:160"/>
Bounds, but to run as far as it
can.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> A second Effect of this Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mind, is, that it peculiarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposes
a man to repent and recover
himself from it. For the first step to
Repentance is a man's dislike of his Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And how can we expect that a man
should conceive any through dislike of
<hi>that,</hi> which has took such an absolute
possession of his Heart and Affections,
that he likes and loves it, not only in his
own Practice, but also in other men's?
Nay, that he is pleased with it, though
he is past the Practice of it. Such a
Temper of Mind, is a down-right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to Repentance; as being
founded in the Destruction of those
Qualities, which are the only Dispositions
and Preparatives to it. For, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Tenderness of Conscience, which
must first create in the Soul a Sence of
Sin, and from thence produce a Sorrow
for it, and at length cause a Relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:107166:161"/>
of it, That, I say, (we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shewn) is took away by a custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
repeated Course of Sinning against
Conscience: So that the very first Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Vertue, which is the Natural
Power of distinguishing between the
Moral <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> of any Action,
is, in effect, pluckt up and destroyed,
And, the Spirit of God finds nothing in
the Heart of such an one, to apply the
Means of Grace to. All Tast, Relish,
and Discernment of the Sutableness of
Vertue, and the Unsutableness of Vice,
being utterly gone from it.</p>
            <p>And, as this is a direct Barr to that
part of Repentance, which looks back
with Sorrow and Indignation upon what
is past; so is it equally such, to that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part of Repentance, which is to look
forward, and to prevent Sin for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For, this properly delivers a man
up to Sin; for as much as it leaves his
Heart destitute of all those Principles,
which should resist it. So that such an
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:107166:161"/>
one must be as bad, as the Devil will
have him, and can be no better, than
the Devil will let him. In both he must
submit to his Measures. And what is
this but a kind of Entrance into, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an Anticipation of Hell? What is
it, but Judgment and Damnation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
begun? For a man in such a case,
is as sure of it, as if he were actually in
the Flames.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> A third Effect of this Disposition
of Mind, (which also naturally follows
from the former) is, that the longer a
man lives, the wickeder he grows, and
his last days are certainly his worst. It
has been observed, that to delight in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men's Sins, was most properly the
Vice of Old Age; and we shall also
find, that it may be as truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called <hi>the Old Age of Vice.</hi> For, as
first, Old Age necessarily implies a man's
having lived so many years, before it
comes upon him; and withall, this sort
of Viciousness supposes the precedent
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:107166:162"/>
Commission of many Sins, by which a
man arrives to it; so it has this further
property of Old Age: That, as when a
man comes once to be Old, he never
retreats, but still goes on, and grows
every day older and older; So when
a man comes once to such a degree of
Wickedness, as to delight in the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of other men, it is more than
ten thousand to one odds, if he ever
returns to a better mind, but grows eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day <hi>worse</hi> and <hi>worse.</hi> For, he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to take up his Thoughts, and
nothing to entertain his Desires with;
which, by a long Estrangement from
better things, come at length perfectly
to loath, and fly off from them.</p>
            <p>A notable instance of which we have
in <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> who was bad enough
in his Youth, but superlatively and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously
so in his Old Age: And the
Reason of this was, Because he took a
particular pleasure in seeing other Men
doe vile and odious things. So that all
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:107166:162"/>
his Diversion at his Beloved <hi>Capreae,</hi> was
to be a Spectator of the Devil's Actors,
representing the worst of Vices upon
that Infamous Stage.</p>
            <p>And therefore let not Men flatter
themselves, (as, no doubt, some doe,)
that though they find it difficult at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to combat and stand out against
an ill Practice, and upon that account
give way to a Continuance in it; yet that
Old Age shall doe that for them, which
they in their Youth could never find in
their heart to doe for themselves; I say,
let not such persons mock and abuse
themselves with such false and absurd
Presumptions. For, they must know,
that an Habit may continue, when it is
no longer able to Act; or rather the
Elicit, Internal Acts of it may be quick
and vigorous, when the External, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Acts of the same Habit utterly
cease: And let Men but reflect upon
their own Observation, and consider
impartially with themselves, how few
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:107166:163"/>
in the World they have known made
better by Age. Generally they will see,
that such leave not their Vice, but their
Vice leaves them; or rather retreats
from their Practices, and retires into
their Fancy; and that, we know, is
boundless and infinire: And when Vice
has once setled it self there, it finds a
vaster and a wider Compass to Act in,
than ever it had before. I scarce know
any thing that calls for a more serious
Consideration from us, than this: For still
Men are apt to perswade themselves, that
they shall find it an easie matter to grow
Vertuous, as they grow Old. But it is a
way of Arguing highly irrational, and
fallacious. For this is a Maxim of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Truth; <hi>That nothing grows weak with
Age, but that which will at length die with
Age;</hi> which Sin never does. The longer
a Blot continues, the deeper it sinks.
And it will be found a Work of no small
difficulty to dispossess and throw out a
Vice from that Heart, where long Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:107166:163"/>
begins to plead Prescription. It is
Naturally impossible for an Old Man to
grow Young again; and, it is next to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
for a decrepit, aged Sinner to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a new Creature, and <hi>be born again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> We need no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the Malign Effects of this
Disposition of Mind, than this one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;
That many perish Eternally,
who never arrived to such a pitch of
Wickedness, as to take any pleasure in,
or indeed to be at all concerned about
the Sins of other Men. But they perish
in the pursuit of their own Lusts, and
the Obedience they personally yield to
their own sinfull Appetites: And that,
questionless, very often not without a
considerable mixture of inward dislike
of themselves for what they doe: Yet
for all that, their Sin (we see) proving
too hard for them, the over-powering
Stream carries them away, and down
they sink into the Bottomless Pit, though
under the Weight of a guilt, by vast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:107166:164"/>
inferiour to that which we have
been discoursing of. For, doubtless ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Men are finally lost, who yet have
no men's Sins to answer for, but their
own: Who never enticed, nor perverted
others to Sin, and much less applauded,
or encouraged them in their Sin: but
only being Slaves to their own corrupt
Affections, have lived and died under
the killing Power of them; and so passed
to a sad Eternity.</p>
            <p>But that other devilish way of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
hitherto spoken of, is so far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this, that this is a kind of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
or rather a kind of Charity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to it. For this is a solitary, single,
that a complicated, multiplied Guilt.
And indeed, if we consider, at what a
rate some Men sin now-a-days; that
Man sins charitably, who Damns no
body but himself. But the other sort
of Sinners, who may properly enough
be said to people Hell, and, in a very
ill sence, to <hi>bear the Sins of many;</hi> as they
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:107166:164"/>
have a Guilt made up of many Guilts,
so what can they reasonably expect, but
a Damnation equivalent to many Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations?</p>
            <p>And thus much for the first General
Inference, from the foregoing Discourse,
shewing the Malignity of such a Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Mind, as induces a Man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in other men's Sins, with reference
to particular Persons.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> The Other Inference shall be with
ference to <hi>Communities,</hi> or <hi>Bodies of Men;</hi>
and so such a Disposition has a most
direct and efficacious Influence to <hi>propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
multiply,</hi> and <hi>spread</hi> the Practice of
any Sin, till it becomes General, and
National. For this is most certain, that
some men's taking pleasure in other
men's Sins, will cause many Men to sin,
to doe them a pleasure; and this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
upon these three Accounts. 1. That
it is seldom or never that any Man
comes to such a Degree of Impiety, as
to take pleasure in other men's Sins,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:107166:165"/>
but he also shews the World by his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Behaviour, that he does so.
2. That there are few Men in the World
so inconsiderable, but there are some,
or other, who have an Interest to serve
by them. And, 3<hi>ly.</hi> That the Natural
Course that one Man takes to serve his
Interest by another, is, by applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to him in such a way, as may most
gratifie and delight him.</p>
            <p>Now from these Three things put
together, it is not only easie, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to inferr, That since the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Men are wholly acted by their
present Interest, if they find those, who
can best serve them in this their Interest,
most likely also to be gained over so to
doe by the sinfull and vile Practices of
those who address to them; no doubt,
such Practices shall be pursued by such
Persons, in order to the Compassing their
desired Ends. Where <hi>Greatness</hi> takes no
delight in <hi>Goodness,</hi> we may be sure, there
shall be but little Goodness seen in the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:107166:165"/>
Lives of those, who have an Interest to
serve by such an one's Greatness. For,
take any Illustrious, potent Sinner, whose
Power is wholly employ'd to serve his
Pleasure, and whose chief Pleasure is to
see others as bad and wicked as himself;
and there is no question, but in a little
time, he will also make them so; and
his Dependants shall quickly become his
Proselytes. They shall Sacrifice their
Vertue to his Humour, spend their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and Good name, nay, and their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Souls too, to serve him; and that by
the worst, and basest of Services, which
is, by making themselves like Him. It
is but too notorious, how long Vice
has reigned, or rather raged amongst us;
and with what a <hi>bare face,</hi> and a <hi>brazen
forehead,</hi> it walks about the Nation (as
it were) <hi>Elato Capite,</hi> and looking down
with Scorn upon Vertue, as a contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and a mean thing. Vice could not
come to this pitch by chance. But we
have sinned a pace; and at an higher
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:107166:166"/>
strain of Villainy, than the <hi>Fopps our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors</hi>
(as some are pleas'd to call
them) could ever arrive to. So that
we daily see Maturity and Age in Vice
joyned with Youth, and Greenness of
Years. A manifest Argument, no doubt,
of the great Docility and Pregnancy of
Parts, that is, in the present Age, above
all the former.</p>
            <p>For, in respect of Vice, nothing is
more usual now-a-days, than for Boys
<hi>illico nasci Senes.</hi> They see their Betters
delight in ill things; they observe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and Countenance to attend the
Practice of them; and this carries them
on furiously to that, which, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they are but too much inclin'd
to; and which Laws were purposely
made by Wise men to keep them from.
They are glad, you may be sure, to
please and preferr themselves at once,
and to serve their Interest and their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality
together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:107166:166"/>
And, as they are come to this Height
and Rampancy of Vice, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
from the Countenance of their Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Superiors; so they have took
some steps higher in the same from this,
That the Follies and Extravagances of
the Young, too frequently carry with
them the Suffrage and Approbation of
the Old. For Age, which naturally and
unavoidably is but one Remove from
Death, and consequently should have
nothing about it, but what looks like a
decent Preparation for it, scarce ever
appears of late days, but in the high
Mode, the flaunting Garb, and utmost
Gaudery of Youth; with Cloaths as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculously,
and as much in the fashion,
as the person that wears them is usually
grown out of it. The Eldest equal the
Youngest in the Vanity of their <hi>Dress,</hi> and
no other Reason can be given of it, but
that they equal, if not surpass them in the
Vanity of their <hi>Desires.</hi> So that those who
by the Majesty and (as I may so say) the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:107166:167"/>
of their Age, should even frown
Youth into Sobriety, and better Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
are now striving all they can, to
imitate and strike in with them, and to
be really <hi>vicious,</hi> that they may be <hi>thought</hi>
to be <hi>young.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sad and apparent Truth of which,
makes it very superfluous to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any further Cause of that monstrous
Encrease of Vice, that, like a Torrent,
or rather a breaking in of the Sea upon
us, has of late years over-flowed, and
victoriously carried all before it. Both
the Honourable, and the Aged, have
contributed all they could to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of it; and, so far as they are
able, to give the best Colour to the worst
of things. This they have endeavoured,
and thus much they have effected, That
Men now see, that Vice makes them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to those, who are able to make
them considerable. It is the Key that
lets them into their very Heart, and
enables them to command all that is
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:107166:167"/>
there. And if this be the Price of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and the Market of Honour, no
doubt, where the Trade is so quick, and
withall so certain, Multitudes will be sure
to follow it.</p>
            <p>This is too manifestly our present
Case. All Men see it; and wise and
good Men lament it: And, where Vice
push'd on with such mighty Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
will stop its progress, it is hard to
judge: It is certainly above all humane
Remedies to controll the prevailing
Course of it; unless the great Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the World, who quells the
Rage and Swelling of the Sea, and <hi>sets
Barrs and Doors to it, beyond which the
proudest of its Waves cannot pass,</hi> shall,
in his infinite Compassion to us, doe
the same to that <hi>Ocean of Vice,</hi> which now
<hi>swells,</hi> and <hi>roars,</hi> and <hi>lifts up it self</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all Banks and Bounds of humane
Laws; and so, by his Omnipotent
Word, reducing its Power, and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
its Pride, shall at length say to it,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:107166:168"/>
               <hi>Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further.</hi>
Which God in his good time effect.</p>

most due, all Praise, Might, Majesty,

            <p>THis excellent Epistle, though, in
the Front of it, it bears a <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
Inscription, yet, in the Drift
and Purpose of it, is <hi>Universal;</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to convince all Mankind (whom
it supposes in pursuit of True Happiness)
of the Necessity of seeking for it in the
Gospel, and the Impossibility of finding
it elsewhere. All, without the Church,
at that time, were comprehended under
the Division of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> called
here by the Apostle <hi>Greeks;</hi> the Nobler,
and more Noted part being used for
the whole. Accordingly, from the 2d.
<hi>Chapter,</hi> down along, he Addresses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the <hi>Iews,</hi> shewing the Insufficiency
of <hi>their Law</hi> to justifie, or make them
happy, how much soever they doated
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:107166:170"/>
upon it. But here, in this first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he deals with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
who sought for, and promised them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the same Happiness from the
Dictates of <hi>Right Reason,</hi> which the
<hi>Iews</hi> did from the <hi>Mosaick Law.</hi> Where,
after he had took an account of what
their bare Reason had taught them in
the Things of God, and compared the
Super-structure with the Foundation,
their Practice with their Knowledge, he
finds them so far from arriving at the
<hi>Happiness,</hi> which they aspired to by this
means, that upon a full survey of the
whole matter, the Result of all comes
to this sad, and deplorable Issue, That
they were sinfull, and miserable, and
<hi>that without excuse.</hi> In the Words, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with the Coherence of the precedent,
and subsequent Verses, we have these Four
Things considerable.</p>
            <p>I. The <hi>Sin</hi> here followed upon a
certain sort of Men, with this so severe
a Judgment; namely, That <hi>knowing
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:107166:170"/>
God, they did not glorifie him as God,</hi>
ver. 21.</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>Persons</hi> guilty of this Sin;
They were <hi>such as professed themselves
Wise,</hi> ver. 22.</p>
            <p>III. The <hi>Cause,</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> of their
falling into this Sin; which was their
<hi>holding the Truth in Unrighteousness,</hi> ver.
18. And,</p>
            <p>IV. and <hi>Lastly,</hi> The <hi>Iudgment,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>State, and Condition penally conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi>
upon these Sinners; namely, <hi>That
they were without excuse,</hi> ver. 20.</p>
            <p>Of each of which in their Order:
And first, for the first of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Sin here followed with so severe a
Iudgment,</hi> and so highly aggravated, and
condemned by the Apostle, is, by the
united Testimony of most Divines upon
this place, the Sin of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> Which
the Apostle affirms to consist in this;
<hi>That the Gentiles glorified not God, as God.</hi>
Which <hi>General</hi> Charge he also draws
forth into <hi>Particulars;</hi> As, That they
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:107166:171"/>
               <hi>changed his Glory into the Similitude and
Images of Men, and Beasts, and Birds;</hi>
where, by <hi>Glory,</hi> he means <hi>God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
to wit, that, by which Men glorifie
him, and not the <hi>Essential Glory</hi> of his
Nature; it being such a Glory, as was
in Men's power to <hi>change,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base;
and therefore must needs consist,
either in those Actions, or those Means,
which they performed the Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
by. I know no place, from which
we may more clearly gather, what the
Scripture accounts <hi>Idolatry,</hi> than from
this Chapter. From whence, that I
may represent to you, what <hi>Idolatry</hi> is,
and wherein one sort of it (at least)
does consist, you may observe, that the
Persons, who are here charged with it,
are positively affirmed to have known,
and acknowledged the True God. For,
it is said of them, that they knew his
<hi>Eternal Power,</hi> and <hi>Godhead,</hi> in this 20th.
Verse; nay, and they <hi>worshipped</hi> him
too. From whence this undeniably,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:107166:171"/>
and invincibly follows, That they did
not <hi>look upon</hi> those <hi>Images,</hi> which they
addressed to, as <hi>Gods,</hi> nor as Things,
in which the Divine Nature did, or
could <hi>enclose</hi> it self; nor, consequently,
to which they gave, or ultimately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
their Religious Worship. This
Conclusion therefore I inferr, and assert;
That <hi>Idolatry</hi> is not only an Accounting,
or Worshipping that for God, which is
not God, but it is also a Worshipping
the True God, in a way wholly unsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his Nature; and particularly,
by the Mediation of Images, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Resemblances of Him. This is
Idolatry: For the Persons here spoken
of, pretended <hi>to glorifie the true God, but
they did not glorifie him, as God,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that account stand arraigned for
<hi>Idolaters.</hi> Common Sence, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
will, and must evince the Truth
of this. For, can any one imagine, that
Men of Reason, who had their Senses
quick, and their Wits and Discourse en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:107166:172"/>
could take that <hi>Image,</hi> or <hi>Statue,</hi> which
they fell down before, to be a <hi>God?</hi>
Could they think that to be <hi>Infinite and
Immense,</hi> the Ubiquity of which they
could thrust into a corner of their Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set?
Or, could they conceive that to be
<hi>Eternal,</hi> which, a few days before, they
had seen a Log, or a Rude Trunk, and
perhaps the other piece of it a Joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool
in the Workman's Shop?</p>
            <p>The Ground, and Reason of all <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
is an Opinion of <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>
in the Person worshipped, to answer
and supply our Desires; which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly doe, unless he first appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them. But, can any Man, who
is Master of Sense himself, believe the
Rational Heathens so void of it, as to
think, that those <hi>Images</hi> could fulfill the
Petitions, which they could not hear,
pity the Wants they could not see, doe
all Things, when they could not stir an
hand, or a foot? 'Tis impossible they
should; but it is also certain, that they
were <hi>Idolaters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:107166:172"/>
And, therefore it is clear, that their
Idolatry consisted in something else,
and the History of it would demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
so much, were it proper to turn
a Sermon into an History. So that
we see here, that the Sin condemned
in the Text, was the <hi>Worshipping of the
True God by Images.</hi> For the Defence
of which, there is no doubt, but they
might have pleaded, and did plead for
those <hi>Images,</hi> that they used them not
as <hi>Objects,</hi> but only as <hi>Means,</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of Divine Worship, not as
<hi>what they worshipped,</hi> but as <hi>that, by which
they directed their Worship to God.</hi> Though
still, me-thinks, it is something hard to
conceive, that none of the Worship
should fall upon the Image, by the way,
or that the Water can be conveyed into
the Sea, without so much as wetting
the Channel through which it passes.
But however you see, it requires a very
distinguishing Head, and an even Hand,
and no small Skill in <hi>directing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:107166:173"/>
to carry a Prayer quite through
to its Journey's end: Though, after all,
the Mischief of it is, that the <hi>Distinction,</hi>
which looks so fine in the <hi>Theory,</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
miscarries in the <hi>Practice;</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
where the Ignorant Vulgar are the
<hi>Practicers,</hi> who are the worst in the
World at distinguishing, but yet make
far the greatest part of Mankind, and
are as much concerned, and obliged to
pray, as the wisest, and the best; but
withall, infinitely unhappy, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perform a Necessary Duty, without
<hi>School-distinctions,</hi> nor beg their <hi>daily
Bread</hi> without <hi>Metaphysicks.</hi> And thus
much for the <hi>first Thing proposed;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>the Sin here spoken against by the Apostle
in the Text;</hi> which was <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The second <hi>is the Persons charged
with this Sin.</hi> And they were not the
<hi>Gnosticks,</hi> as some whimsically imagine,
who can never meet with the Words
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, but
presently the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> must be drawn
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:107166:173"/>
in by Head and Shoulders; But the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
here meant, were plainly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
the Old Heathen Philosophers;
such as not only in the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but also
in their <hi>own phrase, professed themselves to
be wise.</hi> Their great Title was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and the word of Applause still given to
their Lectures, was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
was the first, who abated of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidiousness
of the Name, and from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
brought it down to <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, from a

            <p>These were the Men here intended
by St. <hi>Paul; Men</hi> famous in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Ages; the great Favourites of

<hi>Men</hi> of a Polite Reason, and a Notion
refined, and enlarged by Meditation.
<hi>Such,</hi> as with all these Advantages of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:107166:174"/>
Parts and Study, had been toiling, and
plodding many years, to out-wit and
deceive themselves; sat up many Nights,
and spent many Days to impose a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
upon their Reason; and, in a
word, ran the Round of all the Arts
and Sciences to arrive at length at a
glorious and elaborate Folly; even these,

little Intrigues of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi>
which a Man might <hi>Salvâ Suentiâ,</hi> or at

and stumbl'd about their grand

and most ridiculous Instances of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi>
even so far, as to Worship the

creeping things;</hi> to adore Eternity, and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:107166:174"/>
Immensity in a Brute, or a Plant, or
some viler thing; bowing down, in their
Adoration, to such Things, as they
would scarce otherwise have bowed
down <hi>to take up.</hi> Nay, and to rear
Temples, and make Altars to <hi>Fear,
Lust,</hi> and <hi>Revenge;</hi> there being scarce
a corrupt Passion of the Mind, or a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
of the Body, but what they
<hi>Worshipp'd.</hi> So that it could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that they should ever <hi>repent</hi> of
those Sins, which they thought fit to <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,</hi>
nor <hi>Mortifie</hi> those corrupt Affections,
to which they ascribed a kind of <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
and <hi>Immortality.</hi> By all which, they
fell into a greater Absurdity in Matter
of <hi>Practice,</hi> than ever any one of them
did, in Point of <hi>Opinion,</hi> (which yet
certainly was very hard,) namely, <hi>That
having confessed a God,</hi> and allowed him
the Perfections <hi>of a God,</hi> to wit, an <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Power,</hi> and an <hi>Eternal Godhead,</hi> they
yet denied him the <hi>Worship of God:</hi> Thus
reversing the Great Truths, they had
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:107166:175"/>
subscribed to in <hi>Speculation,</hi> by a brutish,
sensless Devotion, manag'd with a greater
Prostration of Reason, than of Body.</p>
            <p>Had the poor, vulgar Rout only, who
were held under the Prejudices, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessions
of Education, been abused,
into such Idolatrous Superstitions, as to
adore a Marble, or a Golden Deity, it
might have been detested indeed, or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied,
but not so much to be wonder'd
at: But for the <hi>Stoa,</hi> the <hi>Academy,</hi> or
the <hi>Peripaton</hi> to own such a Paradox;
for an <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or a <hi>Plato</hi> to think their
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their <hi>Eternal Mind,</hi> or <hi>Universal
Spirit,</hi> to be found in, or served by the
Images of <hi>four-footed Beasts;</hi> For the
<hi>Stagirite</hi> to recognize his Gods in his
own Book <hi>de Animalibus;</hi> This (as the
Apostle says) <hi>was without excuse:</hi> And
how will these Men answer for their Sins,
who stand thus Condemned for their
Devotions? And thus from the <hi>Persons

Idolatry,</hi> pass we now to the</p>

               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:107166:175"/>
3d. <hi>Thing proposed;</hi> namely, <hi>the Cause,
or Reason of their falling into this Sin; and
that was their holding of the Truth in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
For the making out of which, we
must enquire into these Two things.</p>
            <p>1. What was the <hi>Truth</hi> here spoken
of.</p>
            <p>2. How they <hi>held it in Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first of them; there were <hi>these
six great Truths,</hi> the knowledge of which,
the Gentile Philosophers stood accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for: As,</p>
            <p>1. That there was <hi>a God;</hi> a Being
distinct from this <hi>visible, material</hi> World;
infinitely Perfect, Omniscient, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
Eternal, Transcendently Good and
Holy. For all this is included in the
very Notion of a God. And this was
a Truth wrote with a Sun-beam, clear
and legible to all Mankind, and <hi>received
by</hi> Universal Consent.</p>
            <p>2. That this God was the <hi>Maker</hi> and
<hi>Governour</hi> of this <hi>visible World.</hi> The first
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:107166:176"/>
of which was evident from the very <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Causes;</hi> the great Argument, by
which Natural Reason evinces a God.
It being necessary in such an <hi>Order or
Chain of Causes,</hi> to ascend to, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in <hi>some First.</hi> Which should be
the Original of Motion, and the Cause
of all other Things, but It self be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by none. And then, That God also
<hi>governed</hi> the World, this followed from
the other; For that a Creature should
not depend upon its Creator in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
in which it is capable of depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Him (amongst which, to be
<hi>governed</hi> by Him, is certainly one) is
contrary to the Common Order, and
Nature of Things, and those Essential
Relations, which (by vertue thereof)
they bear to one another; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Absurd and Impossible. So that
upon a bare Principle of Reason, <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
must needs inferr <hi>Providence;</hi> and
God's <hi>making</hi> the World, irrefragably
prove that he <hi>governs</hi> it too; or, that
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:107166:176"/>
a Being of a <hi>Dependent</hi> Nature, remains
nevertheless <hi>Independent</hi> upon Him in
that respect. Besides all which, it is
also certain, that the Heathens did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
acknowledge the World governed
by a Supreme Mind; which knowledge,
whether they had it from Tradition, or
the Discourses of Reason, they stood
however <hi>equally accountable</hi> for, upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> That this God, or Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was to be <hi>Worshipped.</hi> For this was
founded upon his <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> and his
<hi>Providence.</hi> Since He, who could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
or destroy, as he pleased, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
governed the World, ought surely
to be depended upon by those, who
were thus obnoxious to his Power, and
subject to his Government; which <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence</hi>
could not manifest it self, but
by Acts of <hi>Worship, Homage,</hi> and <hi>Address</hi>
to the Person thus depended upon.</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> That this God was to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
or Addressed to, by Vertuous
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:107166:177"/>
and Pious Practices. For so much his
Essential Holiness required, and those
Innate Notions of <hi>Turpe &amp; Honestum,</hi>
wrote in the Consciences of all Men,
and joyned with the Apprehensions, they
had, of the Infinite Purity of the Divine
<hi>Nature,</hi> could not but suggest.</p>
            <p>5<hi>ly.</hi> That upon any Deviation from
Vertue and Piety, it was the Duty of
every <hi>Rational Creature</hi> so deviating, to
condemn, renounce, and be sorry for
every such Deviation: That is, in other
words, <hi>to repent of it.</hi> What indeed, the
Issue or Effect of such a Repentance
might be, bare Reason could not of it
self discover; but that a <hi>peccant Creature</hi>
should disapprove, and repent of every
Violation of, and Declination from the
Rules of <hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Honest,</hi> this, Right
Reason, discoursing upon the Stock of
its own Principles, could not but Inferr.
And the Conscience of every Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is debauched, and hardned by
Habitual Sin, will <hi>recoil</hi> after the doing
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:107166:177"/>
of an Evil Action, and <hi>acquit him</hi> after
a Good.</p>
            <p>6<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> That every such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation
from <hi>Duty,</hi> rendred the Person
so deviating liable, and obnoxious to
<hi>Punishment.</hi> I do not say, that it made
punishment <hi>necessary,</hi> but that it made
the Person so transgressing, <hi>worthy</hi> of
it; So that it might justly be inflicted
on him, and consequently ought ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to be feared, and expected by him.
And upon this Notion, universally fixed
in the Minds of Men, were grounded
all their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Rites</hi> of <hi>Expiation,</hi>
and <hi>Lustration.</hi> The use of which has
been so General, both as to Times, and
Places, that there is no Age or Nation
of the World, in which they have not
been used, as Principal Parts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship.</p>
            <p>Now these <hi>six Grand Truths</hi> were the
<hi>Talent</hi> entrusted, and deposited by God
in the hands of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for them to
Traffick with, to his Honour, and their
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:107166:178"/>
own Happiness. But what little Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
they made of this <hi>Noble Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi>
shall now be shewn in the <hi>next</hi>
Particular; namely, <hi>Their holding of it
in Unrighteousness.</hi> Which they did se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways. As,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>By not Acting up to what they knew.</hi>
As in many Things their <hi>Knowledge</hi> was
short of the <hi>Truth,</hi> so, almost in all
Things, their <hi>Practice</hi> fell short of their
<hi>Knowledge.</hi> The Principles by which
they <hi>walked,</hi> were as much below those
by which they <hi>judged,</hi> as their <hi>Feet</hi> were
below their <hi>Head.</hi> By the one they
looked <hi>upwards,</hi> while they placed the
other <hi>in the Dirt.</hi> Their Writings suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
shew, what raised, and sublime
Notions they had of the Divine Nature,
while they imployed their Reason about
that Glorious Object, and what Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Discourses of Vertue and Morality
the same Reason enabled them to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the World with. But when they
came to transcribe these <hi>Theories</hi> into
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:107166:178"/>
               <hi>Practice,</hi> One seemed to be of no other
use to them at all, but only to reproach
them for the Other. For, they neither
depended upon this God, as if he were
<hi>Almighty,</hi> nor worshipped him, as if they
believed him <hi>Holy;</hi> but in both preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricated
with their own Principles, to that
degree, that their <hi>Practice</hi> was a direct
Contradiction to their <hi>Speculations.</hi> For
the proof of which, go over all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<hi>Temples,</hi> and take a survey of the
Absurdities, and Impieties of their <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
their monstrous Sacrifices, their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
Rites, and Ceremonies. In all
which, Common Sence and Reason,
could not but tell them, that the <hi>Good</hi>
and <hi>Gracious God</hi> could not be <hi>pleased,</hi>
nor consequently <hi>worshipped,</hi> with any
thing <hi>Barbarous</hi> or <hi>Cruel;</hi> nor the most
<hi>Holy God</hi> with any thing <hi>Filthy</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean;</hi>
nor a God <hi>infinitely Wise</hi> with any
thing <hi>Sottish</hi> or <hi>Ridiculous;</hi> and yet
these were the worthy Qualifications of
the Heathen Worship, even amongst
<gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:107166:179"/>
not, by this, assert Contradictions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a <hi>Deity</hi> only to such a measure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
whereas a <hi>Deity,</hi> as such, implies
Perfection beyond all Measure, or Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?
Nor could they, in the next
place, have slid into those brutish Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities of Life, had they duly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured
those first Practical Notions and
Dictates of Right Reason, which the
Nature of Man is Originally <hi>furnish'd</hi>
with; there being not any one of them,
but what is <hi>naturally</hi> productive of many
more. But they quickly stifled, and
<hi>over-laid</hi> those <hi>Infant-principles,</hi> those Seeds
of Piety and Vertue, sown by God and
Nature in their Hearts; so that they
brought a voluntary Darkness and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
upon their Minds; and, by not
<hi>Exercising their Senses to discern between
Good and Evil,</hi> came at length to lose all
Sense and Discernment of either. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
as the Apostle says of them, in the
21st. Verse of this Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Their foolish Heart was darkned:</hi>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:107166:179"/>
And that, not only by the Just Judgment
of God, but also by the very Course
of Nature; Nothing being more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from Experience, than that the not
using or imploying any Faculty, or
Power either of Body, or Soul, does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
weaken, and impair that Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
As a Sword, by long lying still will
contract a Rust, which shall not only
deface its <hi>Brightness,</hi> but, by degrees,
also, consume its very <hi>Substance. Doing</hi>
Nothing, naturally ends in <hi>being</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>It holds in all Operative Principles
whatsoever; but especially in such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to Morality; in which, <hi>not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</hi>
is certainly <hi>to go backward;</hi> there
being <hi>no third Estate,</hi> between <hi>not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing,</hi>
and <hi>retreating</hi> in a vertuous
Course. Growth is of the very Essence,
and Nature of some Things. <hi>To be,</hi>
and to <hi>Thrive,</hi> is all one with them;
and they know no middle Season be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their <hi>Spring,</hi> and their <hi>Fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:107166:180"/>
And therefore, as it is said in <hi>Matth.
13. 12. That from him, who hath not, shall
be taken away even that which he hath.</hi> So
he, who neglects the <hi>Practice,</hi> shall, in
the end also, lose the very <hi>Power</hi> and
Faculty of Doing well. That which
stops a man's <hi>Actual Breathing</hi> very long,
will, in the Issue, take away his very
Power of Breathing too. To hide one's
<hi>Talent</hi> in the ground, is to <hi>bury</hi> it; and
the <hi>Burial</hi> of a Thing either finds it
<hi>dead,</hi> or will quickly <hi>make it so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> These Men <hi>held the Truth in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,
by concealing what they knew.</hi>
For, how rightly soever they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Vertue,</hi> yet the illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Multitude, who, in such things,
must see with better Eyes than their own,
or not see at all, were never the wiser
for it. Whatsoever the inward Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of those <hi>Sophisters</hi> were, they kept
them wholly to themselves; hiding all
those important Truths, all those usefull
Notions from the People, and teaching
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:107166:180"/>
the World much otherwise from what
they judged themselves. Though I think
a greater Truth than this cannot well be
uttered; That never any Thing, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was really good, which was good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to it self. But, from hence it was,
That, even in a Literal sense, <hi>Sin</hi> came
<hi>to be Established by a Law.</hi> For, amongst
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> themselves were
the greatest <hi>Offenders.</hi> They made little
or no provision for Vertue, but very
much for Vice: For, the Early, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Practice of Sin, had turned it into
a <hi>Custom,</hi> and <hi>Custom,</hi> especially in <hi>Sin,</hi>
quickly passed into <hi>Common Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> was the only <hi>Martyr</hi> for the
Testimony of any Truth, that we read of
amongst the <hi>Heathens;</hi> who chose rather
to be Condemned, and to die, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to renounce, or conceal his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
touching the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
But as for the rest of them, even
<hi>Zeno,</hi> and <hi>Chrysippus, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
and generally all those <hi>Heroes</hi> in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:107166:181"/>
they swam with the Stream, (as
foul as it ran,) leaving the poor Vulgar
as Ignorant and Sottish, as Vicious and
Idolatrous as they first found them.</p>
            <p>But it has been always the Practice
of the <hi>Governing Cheats</hi> of all Religions,
to keep the People in as gross Ignorance,
as possibly they could. For (we see)
the <hi>Heathen Impostors</hi> used it before the
<hi>Christian Impostors</hi> took it up, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
it. <hi>Si populus decipi vult, decipiatur,</hi>
was ever a <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver Rule</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them all; though the Pope's
Legate first turned it into a <hi>Benediction:</hi>
And a very strange one it was, and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi>
(one would think) to have made
all that heard it look about them, and
begin to <hi>bless themselves.</hi> For as <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi>
a great Master in such Arts, told
his Fellow-Artist, <hi>Acts 19. 25. It was
by this Craft, that they got their Wealth.</hi>
So, long experience has found it true of
the <hi>unthinking Mobile;</hi> That the <hi>closer</hi>
they shut their <hi>Eyes,</hi> the <hi>wider</hi> they open
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:107166:181"/>
their <hi>Hands.</hi> But this base Trade, the
Church of <hi>England</hi> always abhorr'd; and
for that Cause, as to its Temporal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
has fared accordingly; and,
by this time, may be thought fit for <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have shewn Three nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ways, by which the <hi>Philosophers, and
learned Men amongst the Gentiles,</hi> held the
Truth in <hi>Unrighteousness:</hi> As, first, <hi>That
they did not Practice up to it;</hi> 2ly. <hi>That
they did not Improve it;</hi> And, 3ly. and
Lastly, <hi>That they Concealed, and Dissembled
it.</hi> And this was that, which prepared
and disposed them to greater Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
<hi>For, changing the Truth of God into
a Lye,</hi> they became like those, who, by
often repeating a Lye to others, came
at length to believe it themselves. They
owned the Idolatrous Worship of God
so long, till, by degrees, even in spight
of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> they thought,
that he ought so to be Worshipp'd.
But this stopp'd not here: For, as one
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:107166:182"/>
Wickedness is naturally a step and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
to another; so, from absurd
and senseless Devotions, they passed into
<hi>vile Affections.</hi> Practising Vice against
Nature, and that, in such strange and
abominable Instances of Sin, that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could equal the Corruption of
their <hi>Manners,</hi> but the Delusion of their
<hi>Iudgments;</hi> both of them the true and
proper Causes of one another.</p>
            <p>The Consideration of which (one
would think) should make Men cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and fearfull, how they <hi>suppress,</hi> or
debauch that <hi>Spark</hi> of <hi>Natural light,</hi> which
God has set up in their Souls. When
Nature <hi>is in the Dark,</hi> it will venture to
doe any thing. And, God knows, how
far the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Infatuation may prevail
upon the Heart, when it comes once to
Court, and Love a Delusion. Some
Men hug an Error, because it gratifies
them in a freer Enjoyment of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality:
And for that Reason, God, in
Judgment, suffers them to be plunged
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:107166:182"/>
into fouler, and grosser Errors; such as
even unman, and strip them of the very
Principles of Reason, and sober Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
For, surely, it could be no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Declension of Nature, that could
bring some Men, after an ingenuous
Education in Arts, and Philosophy, to
place their <hi>Summum Bonum</hi> upon their
Trenchers, and their utmost felicity in
Wine and Women, and those Lusts,
and Pleasures, which a <hi>Swine,</hi> or a <hi>Goat,</hi>
has as full, and quick a sense of, as the
greatest States-man, or the best Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
in the World.</p>
            <p>Yet, this was the Custom, this the
known Voice of most of the <hi>Gentiles;
Dum vivimus vivamus; Let us eat and
drink to day, for to morrow we must die.</hi>
That Soul which God had given them
Comprehensive of both Worlds, and
capable of looking into the great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Nature, of Diving into the
Depths beneath, and of understanding
the Motions, and Influences of the Stars
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:107166:183"/>
above; even this glorious, active Thing
did they confine within the pitifull Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of the present Fruition; forbidding
it to take a prospect, so far, as into the
<hi>morrow;</hi> as if to Think, to Contemplate,
or be Serious, had been <hi>High Treason</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Empire and Prerogative of
<hi>Sense,</hi> usurping the Throne of their
baffled and deposed <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how comes it to pass, that even
now-a-days, there is often seen such a
vast Difference between the <hi>former,</hi> and
the <hi>latter</hi> part of some men's Lives?
That those, who first stepp'd forth into
the World, with high, and promising Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
vigorous Intellectuals, and clear
Morals, come at length to grow Sots, and
Epicures, mean in their Discourses, and
dirty in their Practices; but that, as by
degrees, they remitted of their Industry,
loathed their Business, and gave way to
their Pleasures, they let fall those gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Principles, which, in their youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
days, had born them upon the Wing,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:107166:183"/>
and raised them to worthy and great
Thoughts; which <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
not being kept up, and cherished,
but smothered in Sensual Delights, God,
for that Cause, suffered them to flag and
sink into low and inglorious Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to enjoy themselves more in a
<hi>Revel,</hi> or a <hi>Merry-meeting,</hi> a <hi>Strumpet,</hi> or
a <hi>Tavern,</hi> than in being usefull to a
Church, or a Nation, in being a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good to Society, and a benefit to
Mankind. The Parts, that God gave
them, they <hi>held in Unrighteousness,</hi> Sloth,
and Sensuality; and this made God to
desert, and abandon them to themselves;
so that they have had a <hi>doating</hi> and a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit</hi>
Reason, long before Age had given
them such a <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, I could heartily wish,
that such young Persons, as hear me
now, would lodge this one Observation
deep in their Minds; <hi>viz.</hi> That God,
and Nature, have joyned <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and
<hi>Vertue,</hi> by such a near Cognation, or
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:107166:184"/>
rather, such an inseparable Connexion,
that a wise, a prudent, and an honourable
<hi>Old Age,</hi> is seldom, or never found, but as
the <hi>Reward,</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> of a sober, a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
and a well-spent <hi>Youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I descend now to the <hi>Fourth</hi> and
<hi>Last</hi> Thing proposed; namely, the <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or rather the State and Condition pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
consequent upon the Persons here char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Apostle with Idolatry;</hi> which is,
<hi>That they were without excuse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Commission of Sin, it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
for the Sinner to apprehend himself
in Danger, and, upon such apprehension,
to provide for his Safety, and Defence:
And that must be one of these Two
ways: <hi>viz.</hi> Either by <hi>pleading his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
or by using his Power.</hi> But since
it would be infinitely in vain for a <hi>Finite</hi>
Power to contend with an <hi>Infinite; Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi>
(if any thing) must be his Plea;
and that must be, either by an Absolute
Denial; or, at least, by an Extenuation,
or Diminution of his Sin. Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:107166:184"/>
this Course will be found altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as absurd as the other could be;
it being every-whit as irrational for a
Sinner to plead his <hi>Innocence</hi> before <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscience,</hi>
as it would be to oppose his
<hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Omnipotence.</hi> However, the last
Refuge of a guilty Person, is to take
shelter under an <hi>Excuse;</hi> and so to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate,
if he cannot divert the Blow. It
was the method of the great Pattern and
Parent of all Sinners, <hi>Adam,</hi> first to <hi>hide,</hi>
and then to <hi>excuse</hi> himself; to wrap the
<hi>Apple</hi> in the <hi>leaves,</hi> and to give his Case
a Gloss at least, though not a Defence.
But now, when the Sinner shall be
stripp'd of this also, have all his Excuses
blown away, be stabb'd with his own
Arguments, and (as it were) sacrificed
upon that very <hi>Altar,</hi> which he fled to
for <hi>succour,</hi> this, surely, is the height, and
<hi>crisis</hi> of a forlorn Condition. Yet this
was the Case of the Malefactors, who
stand here arraigned <hi>in the Text;</hi> this
was the Consummation of their Doom,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:107166:185"/>
That they were Persons, not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for a <hi>Pardon,</hi> but even for a <hi>Plea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now an <hi>Excuse,</hi> in the Nature of it,
imports these Two things.</p>
            <p>1. The Supposition of a Sin.</p>
            <p>2. The Extenuation of its Guilt.</p>
            <p>As for the Sin it self; we have already
heard what that was, and we will now
see how able they are to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in point of its <hi>Extenuation.</hi> In
which, according to the Two grand
Principles of humane Actions, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
their Morality, the <hi>Understanding</hi>
and the <hi>Will,</hi> the Excuse must derive ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Unwillingness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Unwillingness,</hi> (to speak of this
last first,) the Heathen Philosophers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
asserted <hi>the Freedom of the Will,</hi>
and its inviolable Dominion over its
own Actions; so that no force or co-action
from without could entrench up
on the absolute Empire of this Faculty.</p>
            <p>It must be confessed indeed, that it
has been something lamed in this its
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:107166:185"/>
               <hi>Freedom</hi> by Original Sin: Of which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
the Heathens themselves were not
wholly ignorant, though they were of
its Cause. So that hereupon, the Will
is not able to carry a man out to a <hi>choice</hi>
so perfectly, and in all respects Good,
but that still, there is some adherent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of Imperfection, which, in
strictness of <hi>Morality,</hi> renders every Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it Evil; according to that known,
and most true Rule, <hi>Malum ex quolibet
defectu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the Will has still so
much <hi>Freedom</hi> left, as to enable it to
chuse any Act <hi>in its kind Good,</hi> whether
it be an Act of <hi>Temperance, Iustice,</hi> or the
like; as also to refuse any Act in its <hi>kind
Evil,</hi> whether of <hi>Intemperance, Injustice,</hi>
or the like; though yet, it neither <hi>chuses</hi>
One, nor <hi>refuses</hi> the Other, with such a
perfect Concurrence of all due Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
of Action, but that still, in the sight
of God, judging according to the rigid
Measures of the Law, every such <hi>Choice,</hi>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:107166:186"/>
or <hi>Refusal,</hi> is indeed sinfull, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
This is most certain, whatsoever
<hi>Pelagius</hi> and his Brethren assert to the
contrary.</p>
            <p>But however, that measure of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
which the Will still retains, of being
able to chuse any <hi>Act, materially, and in
its kind Good;</hi> and to refuse the contrary,
was enough to cut off all Excuse from
the Heathen, who never duly improved
the utmost of such a Power, but gave
themselves up to all the Filthiness, and
Licentiousness of Life imaginable. In
all which, it is certain, that they acted
willingly, and without <hi>compulsion;</hi> or
rather indeed greedily, and without <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only Persons amongst the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
who sophisticated Nature and
Philosophy in this particular, were the
<hi>Stoicks;</hi> who affirmed a fatal, unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Concatenation of Causes, reaching
even to the Elicit Acts of Man's Will.
So that according to them, there was
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:107166:186"/>
no <hi>Act of Volition</hi> Exerted by it, but, all
Circumstances considered, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for the Will not to Exert that
Volition. But these were but one Sect
of Philosophers; that is, but an Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in comparison of the rest of the
<hi>Gentiles:</hi> Ridiculous enough, for what
they held, and taught, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not to be laid in the Balance with
the united Judgment of all other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men in the World, unanimously
exploding this Opinion. Questionless
therefore, a thing so deeply engraven
upon the first and most inward Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of man's Mind, as a Perswasion of
the <hi>Will's Freedom,</hi> would never permit
the <hi>Heathens,</hi> (who are here charged by
the Apostle) to Patronize, and Excuse
their Sins upon this score, <hi>That they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them against their Will, and that
they had no Power to doe otherwise.</hi> In
which, every hour's Experience, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon the Method of their own
Actings, could not but give them the
Lye to their face.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:107166:187"/>
The only <hi>remaining Plea</hi> therefore,
which these Men can take sanctuary in,
must be that of <hi>Ignorance;</hi> since there
could be no pretence for <hi>unwillingness.</hi>
But the Apostle divests them even of
this also: For, he says expressly, in <hi>ver.
19. That, what might be known of God,</hi>
that famous and so much disputed of
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, was manifested in them;
and in <hi>ver.</hi> 21. their <hi>unexcusableness</hi> is
stated upon the supposition of this very
thing; <hi>That they knew God,</hi> but for all
that, <hi>did not glorifie him as God.</hi> This
was the Summ of their Charge; and
how it has been made good against
them, we have already shewn, in what
we have spoken about their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
briefly, I confess; but enough to shew
its <hi>Absurdity,</hi> though not to account for
its <hi>Variety;</hi> when <hi>Vossius</hi>'s very Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it makes a thick Volume in
<hi>Folio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Plea of Ignorance</hi> therefore is also
taken out of their Hands; forasmuch
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:107166:187"/>
as they knew that there was a God;
and that this God made, and governed
the World; and upon that account was
to be worshipped, and addressed to;
and that with such a Worship, as should
be agreeable to his Nature; both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Piety, and Vertue of the
<hi>Worshipper,</hi> and also of the Means of the
<hi>Worship</hi> it self. So that he was neither
to be worshipped with impious, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral
Practices, nor with corporeal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances.
For how could an <hi>Image</hi>
help Men in directing their Thoughts
to a <hi>Being,</hi> which bore no Similitude,
or Cognation to that <hi>Image</hi> at all? And
what Resemblance could <hi>Wood,</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi>
bear to a <hi>Spirit</hi> void of all sensible Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and bodily Dimensions? How
could they put Men in mind of <hi>Infinite
Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and such
other Attributes, of which they had not
the least mark or character?</p>
            <p>But now, if these things could not
possibly resemble any <hi>Perfection</hi> of the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:107166:188"/>
               <hi>Deity,</hi> what use could they be of, to
Men in their Addresses to God? For,
can a man's Devotions be helped by
that, which brings an Error upon his
Thoughts? And certain it is, that it is
natural for a Man, by directing his
Prayers to an <hi>Image,</hi> to suppose the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
he prays to, represented by that
<hi>Image.</hi> Which how injurious, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious
it must needs be to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
Incomprehensible Nature of God,
by begetting such false, and low Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of him in the Minds of his
Creature, let <hi>Common Sense,</hi> not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by Interest and Design, be judge.
From all which it follows, That the <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Heathens,</hi> and especially the most
learned of them, not being able to
charge their Idolatry either upon <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
or <hi>Unwillingness, were wholly without
Excuse.</hi> So that it is to be feared, that
<hi>Averroes</hi> had not the right way of Blessing
himself, when, in defiance of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
he wished, <hi>Sit anima mea cum Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:107166:188"/>
And now, after all, I cannot but take
notice, that all that I have said of the
Heathen Idolatry is so exactly appliable
to the Idolatry of another sort of Men
in the World, that, one would think,
this <hi>first Chapter</hi> of the Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
were not so much an Address to
the <hi>Ancient Romans,</hi> as a Description of
the <hi>Modern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to draw towards a Close. The
Use and Improvement of the foregoing
Discourse shall be briefly to inform us
of these Two things.</p>
            <p>1. The Signally great, and peculiar
<hi>Mercy of God</hi> to those, to whom he has
Revealed the Gospel, since there was
nothing, that could have obliged him to
it, upon the account of his <hi>Iustice:</hi> For
if there had, the <hi>Heathens,</hi> to whom he
revealed it not, could not have <hi>been thus
without excuse;</hi> but might very rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have Expostulated the Case with their
Great Judge, and Demurr'd to the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Sentence, had they been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:107166:189"/>
by Him. But, it appears from
hence, that what was sufficient to render
Men <hi>inexcusable,</hi> was not therefore suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to <hi>save</hi> them.</p>
            <p>It is not said by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> nor can
it be proved by any one else, that God
vouchsafed to the <hi>Heathens</hi> the Means
of Salvation, if so be the <hi>Gospel</hi> be the
only Means of it. And yet, I will not,
I dare not affirm, that God will save
none of those, to whom the Sound of
the Gospel never reached: Though this
is evident, that if he does save any of
them, it must not be by that ordinary,
stated, appointed Method, which the
Scripture has revealed to us, and which
they were wholly ignorant of. For grant,
that the <hi>Heathens</hi> knew, that there was a
God, who both made and governed the
World; and who, upon that account,
was to be worshipped, and that with
such a Worship, as should be sutable to
such a <hi>Being;</hi> yet what Principle of
meer Reason could assure them, that
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:107166:189"/>
               <hi>this God would be a Rewarder of such, as
diligently sought, and served him?</hi> For,
certain it is, that there is nothing in the
Nature of God to <hi>oblige</hi> him to reward
any Service of his Creature; forasmuch
as, all that the Creature can doe, is but
<hi>Duty;</hi> and even now, at this time, God
has no other Obligation upon Him, but
his own free Promise to reward the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Obedience of his Servants, which
promise Reason of it self could never
have found out, till God made it known
by Revelation. And moreover, what
Principle of Reason could assure a Man
that God <hi>would pardon</hi> Sinners upon any
terms whatsoever? Possibly it might
know, <hi>That God could doe so;</hi> but this
was no sufficient Ground for Men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon. And then, last of all, as
for the way of his Pardoning Sinners,
that he should doe it upon a <hi>satisfaction</hi>
paid to his <hi>Iustice,</hi> by such a Saviour, as
should be <hi>both God and Man;</hi> this was
utterly impossible for all the Reason of
Mankind to find out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:107166:190"/>
For, that these things could be read
in the <hi>Book of Nature,</hi> or the Common
Works of God's Providence, or be
learned <hi>by the Sun and Moon's preaching the
Gospel,</hi> as some have fondly (not to
say prophanely) enough asserted, it is
infinitely sottish to imagine, and can
indeed be nothing else, but the <hi>Turning
the Grace of God into wanton,</hi> and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Propositions.</p>
            <p>It is clear therefore, that the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
had no knowledge of <hi>that way,</hi> by
which <hi>alone</hi> we expect Salvation. So
that all the Hope, which we can have for
them, is, That the <hi>Gospel</hi> may not be
the <hi>utmost Limit</hi> of the Divine Mercy;
but that the Merits of Christ may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow,
and run over the Pale of the
Church, so, as to reach <hi>even</hi> many of
those who lived and died invincibly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of him.</p>
            <p>But whether this shall be so, or no,
God alone knows, who only is privy
to the great Counsels of his own Will.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:107166:190"/>
It is a <hi>Secret</hi> hid from us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though we may hope Compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
yet, I am sure, we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
nothing Certainly; It is enough
for us, that God has asserted his <hi>Iustice,</hi>
even in his Dealing with those, whom
he treats not upon Terms of <hi>Evangelical
Mercy.</hi> So that such persons, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>excuse themselves,</hi> nor yet <hi>accuse him;</hi>
who, in the severest Sentence, that he
can pronounce upon the Sinner, will
(as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us) <hi>be justified when
he speaks, and clear when he is judged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> In the next place, we gather
hence the unspeakably wretched, and
deplorable Condition of obstinate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
under the Gospel. The Sun of
Mercy has shined too long, and too
bright upon such, to leave them any
shadow of <hi>Excuse.</hi> For, let them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
over all the Topicks of <hi>Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and <hi>Human Weakness,</hi> and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
other pretences, poor, sinking Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are apt to catch at, to support and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:107166:191"/>
save themselves by; yet, how Trifling
must be their Plea! how Impertinent
their Defence!</p>
            <p>For, admit an Impenitent Heathen to
plead, that albeit his Conscience told
him, that he had sinned; yet, it could
not tell him, that there was any provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Mercy for him upon his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
He knew not whether Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life would be accepted after
the Law was once broke; or, that there
was any <hi>other Righteousness</hi> to Atone, or
Merit for him, but his own.</p>
            <p>But no Christian, who has been taken
into the Arms of a better Covenant,
and grown up in the knowledge of a
Saviour, and the Doctrine of <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Repentance</hi> from Dead <hi>Works,</hi> can speak
so much as one plausible word, for his
Impenitence. And therefore, it was said
of him, who came to the <hi>Marriage-feast
without a Wedding-garment,</hi> that, being
charged, and apprehended for it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>he was Speechless,</hi> struck with <hi>Shame,</hi> and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:107166:191"/>
               <hi>Silence,</hi> the proper Effects of an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering
Guilt, too manifest to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
and too gross to be defended.
His Reason deserted, and his Voice fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, finding himself Arraigned, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed,
and Condemned in the Court of
his own Conscience.</p>
            <p>So that if after all this, his great Judge
had freely asked him, What he could
alledge, or say for himself, why he
should not have Judgment to die Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
and Sentence to be Awarded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the utmost Rigours of the
Law, he could not, in this forlorn <hi>Case,</hi>
have made use of the very last Plea of
a Cast <hi>Criminal;</hi> nor so much as have
cried, <hi>Mercy, Lord, Mercy.</hi> For, still
his Conscience would have replied upon
him, That Mercy had been offered, and
abused; and, that the Time of Mercy
was now past. And so, under this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming
Conviction, every Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinner
must pass to his Eternal Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
taking the whole Load of his own
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:107166:192"/>
Damnation solely, and entirely upon
himself, and acquitting the most Just
God, <hi>who is Righteous in all his Works,
and Holy in all his Ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whom (therefore) be rendred, and
ascribed, as is most due, all Praise,
Might, Majesty, and Dominion, both
now, and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <q>And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE whole Scheme of these Words
is Figurative, as being a Parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Description of God's vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safing
to the World the Invaluable Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Gospel, by the Similitude of
a <hi>King,</hi> with great Magnificence, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing
<hi>his Son's Marriage,</hi> and with
equal Bounty bidding, and inviting all
about him to that Royal <hi>Solemnity;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his severe Animadversion,
both upon those, who would not come,
and upon one, who did come in a very
unbeseeming manner.</p>
            <p>For the better understanding of which
Words, we must observe, that in all
Parables, Two things are to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:107166:194"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Scope and Design of the
Parable; And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Circumstantial passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
serving only to compleat and make
up the Narration.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, in our Application of
any Parable to the Thing designed, and
set forth by it, we must not look for
an absolute and exact Correspondence
of all the Circumstantial, or Subservient
passages of the Metaphorical part of it,
with just so many of the same, or the
like Passages in the Thing intended by
it; but it is sufficient, that there be a
certain Analogy, or Agreement between
them, as to the principal Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of both.</p>
            <p>As for the Design of this <hi>Parable,</hi> it
is, no doubt, to set forth the free Offer
of the Gospel, with all its rich Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church and Nation,
in the first place; and upon their Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of it, and God's Rejection of them
for that Refusal, to declare the Calling
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:107166:194"/>
of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their Room, by a free,
unlimited Tender of the Gospel to all
Nations whatsoever; adding withall a
very dreadfull, and severe Sentence upon
those, who being so freely invited, and
so generously admitted, to such high,
and undeserved Privileges, should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
abuse, and despise them by an
unworthy, wicked, and ungratefull De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
under them.</p>
            <p>For Men must not think that the
Gospel is all made up of <hi>Privilege</hi> and
<hi>Promise,</hi> but that there is something of
Duty to be performed, as well as of
Privilege to be enjoyed. No welcome
to <hi>a Wedding-supper, without a Wedding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garment;</hi>
and no coming by a Wedding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garment
for nothing. In all the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
between God, and the Souls of
Men, something is expected on both
sides; there being a fix'd, indissoluble,
and (in the language of the Parable) a
kind of <hi>Marriage-Tye</hi> between Duty, and
Privilege, which renders them inseparable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:107166:195"/>
Now, though I question not, but that
this Parable of the <hi>Wedding-supper</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
in it the whole Complex of all
the Blessings, and Privileges exhibited by
the Gospel; yet, I conceive, that there
is one <hi>Principal Privilege</hi> amongst all the
rest, that it seems more peculiarly to
aim at, or at least may more apposite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and emphatically be applied to, than
to any other whatsoever. And that is
the Blessed <hi>Sacrament of the Eucharist,</hi> by
which all the Benefits of the Gospel are
in an higher, fuller, and more Divine
manner conveyed to the Faithfull, than
by any other Duty or Privilege belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our Excellent Religion. And
for this, I shall offer these Three follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. Because the Foundation of all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,
is, (as we have shewn) some
<hi>Analogy</hi> or <hi>Similitude</hi> between the Tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
or Allusive part of the Parable, and
the Thing couched under it, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by it. <hi>But</hi> now, of all the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:107166:195"/>
Privileges, or Ordinances of the
Gospel, which of them is there, that
carries so natural a Resemblance to a
<hi>Wedding-supper</hi> as that, which every one
of a very ordinary, discerning Faculty
may observe <hi>in the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist?</hi>
For, surely, neither the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word, nor yet the Sacrament
of Baptism, bears any such <hi>Resemblance,</hi>
or Affinity to it. But, on the other
side, this Sacrament of the Eucharist so
lively resembles, and so happily falls in
with it, that it is indeed it self a <hi>Supper,</hi>
and is called a <hi>Supper,</hi> and that by a
genuine, proper, as well as a common,
and received Appellation.</p>
            <p>2. This Sacrament is not only with
great Propriety of Speech called a <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;</hi>
but moreover, as it is the grand,
and prime means of the nearest, and
most intimate Union, and Conjunction
of the Soul with Christ, it may, with
a peculiar Significancy, be called also a
<hi>Wedding-supper.</hi> And, as Christ frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:107166:196"/>
in Scripture, owns himself related to
the Church, as <hi>an Husband to a Spouse;</hi>
So, if these Nuptial Endearments, by
which Christ gives himself to the Soul,
and the Soul mutually gives it self to
Christ, pass between Christ and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in any Ordinance of the Gospel,
doubtless it is most eminently, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
in this. Which is another preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Instance of the Notable Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
between this <hi>Divine Sacrament,</hi>
and the <hi>Wedding-supper</hi> in the Parable;
and, consequently, a further Argument,
of the Elegant, and Expressive Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of one by the other.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> The very Manner of
Celebrating this Sacrament, which is by
the <hi>Breaking of Bread,</hi> was the way and
manner of transacting Marriages in some
of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries. Thus <hi>Q. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
reports, That when <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great Married the <hi>Persian Roxana,</hi> the
Ceremony they used, was no other, but
this; <hi>Panem gladio divisum uter que libabat,</hi>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:107166:196"/>
he divided a piece of Bread with his
Sword, of which each of them took a
part, and so thereby the Nuptial Rites
were performed. Besides, that this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of <hi>Feasting</hi> belongs most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
both to <hi>Marriage,</hi> and to the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi>
as both of them have the Nature
of a <hi>Covenant.</hi> And all Covenants were,
in Old times, solemnized, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with Festival <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking;</hi>
the Persons newly Confederate, always
thereupon, Feasting together in token of
their full and perfect Accord, both as
to Interest and Affection.</p>
            <p>And now these three Considerations
together, so exactly suting the Parable
of the <hi>Wedding-supper</hi> to this Spiritual,
Divine Banquet of the Gospel, if it does
not primarily, and in its first design, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it; yet, certainly it may, with
greater advantage of Resemblance be
applied to it, than to any other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Privilege belonging to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:107166:197"/>
Upon the Warrant of which, so very
particular, and extraordinary a Cogna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between them, I shall, at present,
treat of the Words wholly with reference
to this Sacred, and Divine Solemnity,
observing, and gathering from them, as
they lie in Coherence with the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and following Parts of the Parable,
these Two Propositions.</p>
            <p>1. That to a worthy Participation of
the Holy Mysteries, and great Privileges
of the Gospel; and particularly, that of
the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi> there is indispensably
required a sutable <hi>Preparation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That God is a strict Observer
of, and a severe Animadverter upon,
such as presume to partake of those
Mysteries, without such a Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And first, for the first of these; <hi>viz.
That to a worthy Participation of the Holy
Mysteries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now this Proposition imports in it
Two things:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:107166:197"/>
1. That to a right discharge of this
Duty, a <hi>Preparation</hi> is necessary.</p>
            <p>2. That every <hi>Preparation</hi> is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
And first, for the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> of these: <hi>That a Preparation is
Necessary.</hi> And this, I confess, is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which I am heartily sorry, that any
Preacher should find it needfull to speak
so much as <hi>one</hi> word upon. For, would
any Man, in his Wits, venture to die
without <hi>Preparation?</hi> And, if not, let
me tell you, that nothing less than that,
which <hi>will</hi> fit a Man for Death, can fit
him for the Sacrament. The truth is,
there is nothing great, or considerable
in the World, which ought to be done, or
<hi>ventured upon,</hi> without <hi>Preparation:</hi> But,
above all, how dangerous, sottish, and
irrational is it, to engage in any Thing,
or Action <hi>extempore,</hi> where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
is <hi>Eternity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>None but the Careless, and the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(and few are Confident, but what
are first Careless) would rush rudely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:107166:198"/>
to the Presence of a Great Man: And,
shall we, in our Applications to the
Great God, take that to be Religion,
which the Common Reason of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
will not allow to be Manners? The
very Rules of Worldly Civility might
instruct Men how to order their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to God. For who, that is to
appear before his <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>Patron,</hi>
would not view, and re-view himself
over and over, with all imaginable Care
and Solicitude, that there be nothing
justly offensive in his Habit, Language,
or Behaviour? But especially, if he be
vouchsafed the Honour of his Table, it
would be infinitely more absurd, and
shamefull to appear foul and sordid
there; and in the Dress of the <hi>Kitchin,</hi>
receive the Entertainments of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What previous Cleansings, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations,
and what peculiar Vestments
were the Priests, under the Law, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to use, when they were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:107166:198"/>
before God in the Sanctuary! And
all this upon no less a penalty than
Death. This, and this they were to
doe, <hi>lest they died,</hi> lest God should strike
them dead upon the spot: as we read
in <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 35. and in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Books of <hi>Moses.</hi> And so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
were the <hi>Iews</hi> in their Preparations
for the Solemn Times of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that every <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> had its <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, a part of the
Sixth Day, from the Hour of Six in the
<hi>Evening,</hi> to fit them for the Duties of
the Seventh Day: Nor was this all;
but they had also a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>about Three in the Afternoon,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them for that: And indeed, the
whole Day was, in a manner, but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
to the next; several Works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disallow'd, and forborn amongst
them on that Day, which were not so
upon any of the foregoing <hi>Five:</hi> So
carefull, even to Scrupulosity, were they
to keep their <hi>Sabbath</hi> with due Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:107166:199"/>
and Devotion; that they must
not only have a Time to prepare them
for that, but a further Time also, to
prepare them for their very <hi>Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, and the Heathens (many of
them at least) when they were to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to their greatest, and most Revered
Deities, used, on the Evening before, to
have a certain Preparative Rite or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
called by them <hi>Coena pura;</hi> That
is, a Supper, consisting of some peculiar
Meats, in which they imagined a kind
of Holiness; and, by Eating of which,
they thought themselves Sanctified, and
fitted to officiate about the Mysteries of
the ensuing Festival. And what were
all their <hi>Lustrations,</hi> but so many Solemn
Purifyings, to render both themselves, and
their Sacrifices, acceptable to their Gods?</p>
            <p>So that we see here a Concurrence
both of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> in this
Practice, before Christianity ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
Which, to me, is a kind of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:107166:199"/>
That the Necessity of
men's preparing themselves for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Offices of Religion, was a Lesson,
which the meer Light and Dictates of
Common Reason, without the help of
Revelation, taught all the knowing and
intelligent part of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will wash my Hands in Innocency,</hi> (says
<hi>David,) and so will I compass thine Altar,</hi>
Psal. 26. 6. And as the Apostle told
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Heb. 13. 10. <hi>We also,</hi> We
Christians, <hi>have an Altar</hi> as well as they;
an Altar as Sacred, an Altar to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
with as much Awe and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
and though there be no fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, yet there is a dreadfull one that
follows it. A fire, that does not indeed
consume the Offering; but such an one,
as will be sure to seize, and prey upon
the unworthy Offerer. <hi>I will be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
(says <hi>God) in them that come nigh
me,</hi> Levit. 10. 3. And God then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
himself sanctified in such persons,
when they sanctifie themselves. <hi>Nadab</hi>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:107166:200"/>
and <hi>Abihu</hi> were a dreadfull Exposition
of this Text.</p>
            <p>And for what concerns our selves;
He that shall throughly consider, what
the Heart of Man is, what Sin and the
World is, and what it is to approve one's
self to an All-searching Eye, in so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
a Duty as the Sacrament, must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that a Man may as well go
about it without a <hi>Soul,</hi> as without <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the holyest Man living, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with the World, insensibly draws
something of Soil, and Taint from it:
The very Air and Meen, the Way and
Business of the World still (as it were)
rubbing something upon the Soul, which
must be fetched off again, before it can
be able heartily to converse with God.
Many secret Indispositions, Coldnesses
and Aversions to Duty, will undiscerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
steal upon it; and it will require both
Time, and close Application of Mind,
to recover it to such a Frame, as shall
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:107166:200"/>
dispose and fit it for the Spiritualities of
Religion.</p>
            <p>And such as have made trial, find it
neither so easie, nor so ready a passage
from the Noise, the Din, and Hurry of
Business, to the Retirements of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from the Exchange to the Closet,
and from the Freedoms of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the Recollections and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines
of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iews,</hi> as soon as they came from
Markets, or any other such promiscuous
Resorts, would be sure to use accurate,
and more than ordinary Washings. And
had their Washings soak'd through the
Body, into the Soul; and had not their
Inside, reproached their Outside, I see
nothing in this Custom, but what was
allowable enough, and (in a People
which needed <hi>Washing</hi> so much) very
commendable. Nevertheless, whatsoever
it might have in it peculiar to the Genius
of that Nation, the spiritual Use and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of it, I am sure, may very well
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:107166:201"/>
reach the best of us. So, that if the
<hi>Iews</hi> thought this Practice requisite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they sat down to their own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
let us Christians think it absolutely
necessary, when we come to God's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>not to eat till we have washed.</hi> And
when I have said so, I suppose I need
not add, that our <hi>Washing</hi> is to be like
our <hi>Eating,</hi> both of them Spiritual;
that we are to carry it from the Hand,
to the Heart, to improve a Ceremonial
Nicety into a Substantial Duty, and the
Modes of Civility, into the Realities of
Religion.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the First Thing,
<hi>That a Preparation in General is Necessary.</hi>
But then, 2<hi>ly.</hi> The other Thing import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Proposition, is, <hi>That every Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
is not sufficient.</hi> It must be a
sutable Preparation; none but a <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-garment</hi>
will serve the turn; a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as much fitted to the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as to the Body it self, that wears
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:107166:201"/>
Now, all Fitness lies in a particular
Commensuration, or Proportion of one
thing to another; and, that such an one,
as is founded in the very Nature of
Things themselves, and not in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of Men concerning them. And,
for this Cause it is, that the Soul, no
less than the Body, must have its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
distinct Postures, and Dispositions,
fitting it for several distinct Offices, and
Performances. And, as no Man comes
with folded Arms to fight or wrestle,
nor prepares himself for the Battle, as
he would compose himself to Sleep;
so, upon a true estimate of Things, it
will be found every whit as absurd and
irrational, for a Man to discharge the
most extraordinary Duty of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
at the Rate of an ordinary Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For, this is really a Paradox in
Practice, and Men may sometimes <hi>doe,</hi>
as well as <hi>speak</hi> Contradictions.</p>
            <p>There is a great Festival now draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on; a Festival, designed chiefly for
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:107166:202"/>
the Acts of a joyfull Piety, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
made only an occasion of Bravery.
I shall say no more of it at present, but
this; That God expects from Men some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than ordinary at such times,
and that it were much to be wished, for
the Credit of their Religion, as well as
the Satisfaction of their Consciences;
that their <hi>Easter</hi> Devotions would, in
some measure, come up to their <hi>Easter</hi>
Dress.</p>
            <p>Now, that our <hi>Preparation</hi> may answer
the important Work and Duty which
we are to engage in, these Two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
or Qualifications, are required
in it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That it be <hi>Habitual.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. That it be also <hi>Actual.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For, it is certain, that there may both
be Acts, which proceed not from any
pre-existing Habits; and, on the other
side, Habits, which lie for a time dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,
and do not at all exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Action. But, in the Case now
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:107166:202"/>
before us, there must be a Conjunction
of both; and, one without the other,
can never be <hi>effectual</hi> for that purpose,
for which both together are but <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi>
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For <hi>Habitual Preparation.</hi> This
consists in a standing, permanent Habit,
or Principle of Holiness, wrought chiefly
by God's Spirit, and instrumentally by
his Word, in the Heart, or Soul of Man:
Such a Principle, as is called, both by
our Saviour, and his Apostles, the <hi>New
Birth,</hi> the <hi>New Man,</hi> the <hi>Immortal Seed,</hi>
and the like; and, by which a Man is
so universally changed, and transformed
in the whole Frame and Temper of his
Soul, as to have a new Judgment, and
Sence of Things, new Desires, new Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
and Inclinations.</p>
            <p>And this is first produced in him, by
that mighty, spiritual Change, which we
call <hi>Conversion.</hi> Which, being so rarely
and seldom found in the Hearts of Men,
(even where it is most pretended to) is
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:107166:203"/>
but too full, and sad a Demonstration
of the Truth of that terrible Saying;
<hi>That few are chosen; and consequently, but
few save.</hi> For, who almost is there, of
whom we can with any Rational <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
or perhaps so much as <hi>likelihood,</hi>
affirm, Here is a Man, whose Nature
is renewed, whose Heart is changed, and
the stream of whose Appetites is so turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he does with as high, and quick
a relish, taste the ways of Duty, Holiness,
and strict Living, as others, or as he
himself before this, grasped at the most
enamouring Proposals of Sin; Who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
(I say) is there, who can reach
and verifie the height of this Character?
and yet, without which, the Scripture
absolutely affirms, <hi>That a Man cannot see
the Kingdom of God,</hi> John 3. 3. For, let
Preachers say and suggest what they
will, <hi>Men will doe as they use to doe;</hi> and,
<hi>Custom</hi> generally is too hard for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
in spight of all its Convictions.
Possibly sometimes in Hearing or Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:107166:203"/>
the Word, the Conscience may be
alarmed, the Affections warmed, good
Desires begin to kindle, and to form
themselves into some degrees of Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but the Heart remaining all the
time unchanged; as soon as Men slide
into the common Course, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
of the World, all those Resolutions,
and Convictions, quickly cool, and
languish, and after a few days are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
as troublesome Companions.
But assuredly, no Man was ever made
a true Convert, or a <hi>new Creature,</hi> at so
easie a Rate; Sin was never dispossessed,
nor Holiness introduced by such feeble,
vanishing Impressions. Nothing under
a total, through Change will suffice; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tears, nor Trouble of Mind, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good Desires, nor Intentions, nor
yet the Relinquishment of some Sins,
nor the Performance of some Good
Works will avail any thing, <hi>but a new
Creature:</hi> A Word, that comprehends
more in it, than Words can well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:107166:204"/>
and, perhaps after all that can
be said of it, never throughly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by what a Man <hi>hears</hi> from
others, but by what he must <hi>feel</hi> within
himself.</p>
            <p>And now, that this is required as the
Ground-work of all our Preparations for
the Sacrament, is evident from hence;
Because this Sacrament is not first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to <hi>make</hi> us Holy, but rather <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses</hi>
us to be so; it is not a converting,
but a <hi>confirming</hi> Ordinance. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
our <hi>spiritual Food:</hi> And, as all
<hi>Food</hi> pre-supposes a <hi>Principle of Life</hi> in
him who receives it, which Life is, by
this means, to be continued and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported;
So the Sacrament of the <hi>Lord's
Supper</hi> is Originally intended to preserve
and maintain that <hi>Spiritual Life,</hi> which
we doe or should receive in Baptism, or
at least by a through Conversion after it.
Upon which account, according to the
true Nature and Intent of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Men should not expect <hi>Life,</hi> but
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:107166:204"/>
               <hi>Growth</hi> from it: And see, that there be
something to be fed, before they seek
out for provision. For, the Truth is,
for any one who is not passed from
<hi>Death to Life,</hi> and has not in him that
<hi>New living Principle,</hi> which we have
been hitherto speaking of, to come to
this Spiritual Repast, is, upon the matter,
as absurd and preposterous, as if he who
makes a Feast, should send to the Graves
and the Church-yards for Guests, or
entertain and treat a Corps at a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.</p>
            <p>Let Men therefore consider, before
they come hither, whether they have any
thing besides <hi>the Name</hi> they received in
Baptism, to prove their Christianity by.
Let them consider, whether, as by their
Baptism, they formerly washed away
their Original Guilt, so they have not
since, by their Actual Sins, washed away
their Baptism. And, if so, Whether the
<hi>converting Grace</hi> of God has set them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Legs again, by forming in
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:107166:205"/>
them a <hi>New Nature.</hi> And, that such
an one, as exerts and shews it self by
the sure, infallible Effects of a Good life:
Such an one, an enables them to reject
and trample upon all the alluring Offers
of the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> so
as not to be conquered, or enslaved by
them; and, to chuse the hard and rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Paths of Duty, rather than the easie
and voluptuous Ways of Sin: which
every Christian, by the very Nature of
his Religion, as well as by his Baptismal
Vow, is strictly obliged to doe: And,
if upon an impartial survey of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
Men find that no such Change
has passed upon them, either let them
prove, that they may be Christians upon
easier terms, or have a care how they
intrude upon so great, and holy an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
in which God is so seldom
<hi>mocked,</hi> but it is to the Mocker's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
And thus much for <hi>Habitual
Preparation.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> Over and above this, there is
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:107166:205"/>
required also an <hi>Actual Preparation;</hi> which
is (as it were) the furbishing or rubbing
up of the former Habitual Principle.</p>
            <p>We have both of them excellently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. in the Parable of
the <hi>Ten Virgins;</hi> of which, the <hi>Five Wise</hi>
are said to have had <hi>Oil in their Lamps;</hi>
yet, notwithstanding that, <hi>Mid-night</hi> and
Weariness was too hard for them, and
they all slumber'd and slept, and their
Lamps cast but a dim, and a feeble
Light till the <hi>Bridegroom's approach;</hi> but
then, upon the first Alarm of that, they
quickly <hi>rose, and trimmed their Lamps,</hi>
and without either <hi>trimming</hi> or <hi>painting</hi>
themselves (being as much <hi>too Wise,</hi> as
some should be <hi>too Old</hi> for such Follies)
they presently put themselves into a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness,
to receive their surprizing Guest.
Where, by their <hi>having Oil in their Lamps,</hi>
no doubt, must be understood a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Grace infused into their Hearts,
or the new Nature formed within them;
and, by their <hi>Trimming their Lamps,</hi> must
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:107166:206"/>
be meant their Actual Exercise, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of that standing Principle, in
the particular Instances of Duty, suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and appropriate to the grand So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of the Bridegroom's Reception.
In like manner, when a Man comes to
this Sacrament, it is not enough that he has
an Habitual stock of Grace, that he has
the <hi>Immortal Seed</hi> of a Living Faith sown
in his Heart. This indeed is necessary,
but not sufficient; his Faith must be,
not only <hi>living,</hi> but <hi>lively</hi> too; it must
be brightned and stirr'd up, and (as it
were) put into a posture by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Exercise of those several Vertues, that
are specifically requisite to a due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this Duty: <hi>Habitual Grace</hi>
is the Life, and <hi>Actual Grace</hi> the Beauty
and Ornament of the Soul; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let People in this high and great
Concern be but so just to their Souls,
as, in one much less, they never fail to
be to their Bodies; in which the greatest
Advantages of Natural Beauty make
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:107166:206"/>
none think the further advantage of a
Decent <hi>Dress</hi> superfluous.</p>
            <p>Nor is it at all strange, if we look into
the Reason of Things, That a Man habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
Good and Pious, should, at some
certain Turns, and Times of his Life, be
at a loss, how to exert the highest Acts
of that Habitual Principle. For, no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>is perfect and pure Act;</hi> especially a
Creature so compounded of Soul and
Body, that Body seems much the stronger
part in the composition.</p>
            <p>Common Experience shews, that the
wisest of Men are not always fit and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to act wisely, nor the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
Speakers to speak eloquently, and
exactly. They have indeed an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
standing Ability of Wisdom and
Eloquence within them, which gives them
an Habitual Sufficiency for such Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.
But, for all that, if the deepest
States-man should presume to go to
Council immediately from his Cups, or
the <hi>ablest Preacher</hi> think himself fitted to
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:107166:207"/>
Preach, only by stepping up to the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit;
notwithstanding the Policy of one,
and the Eloquence of the other, they may
chance to get the just character of <hi>bold
Fools</hi> for venturing, whatsoever <hi>good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>
may bring them off.</p>
            <p>And therefore, the most Active Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Faculties of the Mind require
something beside themselves to raise
them to the full height of their Natural
Activity: Something to excite, and
quicken, and draw them forth into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Action. And this holds propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
in all things Animate, or Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
in the World. The bare Nature,
and essential Form of Fire, will enable it
to burn; but there must be an enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Breath of Air besides, to make it
flame. A Man has the same strength,
sleeping and waking; but while he sleeps,
it fits him no more for business, than if
he had none. Nor is it the having of
Wheels, and Springs, though never so
curiously wrought, and artificially set,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:107166:207"/>
but the winding of them up, that must
give Motion to the Watch. And it
would be endless to Illustrate this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
by all the various Instances that Art
and Nature could supply us with.</p>
            <p>But the case is much the same in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals:
For, Grace in the Soul, while
the Soul is in the Body, will always
have the ill Neighbourhood of some
Remainders of Corruption; which,
though they do not conquer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish,
yet will be sure to slacken,
and allay the vigour and briskness of
the Renewed Principle; so that when
this Principle is to engage in any great
Duty, it will need the actual Intention,
the particular Stress and Application of
the whole Soul, to disencumber, and
set it free, to scour off its Rust, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
those Hindrances, which would
otherwise clog and check the Freedom
of its Operations.</p>
            <p>And thus having shewn, that to fit
us for a due Access to the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:107166:208"/>
we must add <hi>Actual</hi> Preparation
to <hi>Habitual,</hi> I shall now endeavour to
shew the several Parts or Ingredients,
of which this Actual Preparation must
consist.</p>
            <p>And here I shall not <hi>pretend</hi> to give
an Account of every particular Duty
that may be usefull for this purpose, but
shall only mention some of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
and such as may most peculiarly
contribute towards it: As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Let a Man apply himself to the
great and difficult Work of <hi>Self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
by a strict Scrutiny into, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
of the whole Estate of his Soul;
according to that known and excellent
Rule of the Apostle, in the very Case
now before us; 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 28. Let a
man examine himself, and so let him eat of
that Bread,</hi> &amp;c. If a Man would have
such a <hi>Wedding-garment</hi> as may fit him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
let Self-examination take the <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
A Duty of so mighty an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon all that concerns the Soul,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:107166:208"/>
that it is indeed the very Root, and
Ground-work of all true Repentance,
and the Necessary <hi>Antecedent,</hi> if not also
the direct <hi>Cause</hi> of a Sinner's Return to
God.</p>
            <p>For, as there are some Sins which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a particular, and distinct Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
by themselves, and cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for in the general Heap of Sins
<hi>known</hi> and <hi>unknown;</hi> so, how is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for a Man to repent rightly of such
Sins, unless, by a through Search into
the Nature, Number, and Distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Circumstances of them, he comes
to see how, and in what Degree they
<hi>are</hi> to be repented of!</p>
            <p>But the Soveraign Excellency and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of this Duty, needs no other nor
greater Proof of it, than this one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
That nothing in Nature can
be more grievous, and offensive to a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
than to look into himself; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
what Grace requires, Nature is
most averse to. It is indeed as offensive
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:107166:209"/>
as to rake into a Dunghill; as grievous,
as for one to read over his Debts, when
he is not able to pay them; or for a
Bankrupt to examine, and look into his
Accounts, which at the same time that
they <hi>acquaint,</hi> must needs also <hi>upbraid</hi>
him with his Condition.</p>
            <p>But as irksome as the Work is, it is
absolutely Necessary. Nothing can well
be imagined more painfull, than to
probe and search a purulent old Sore to
the Bottom, but for all that, the Pain
must be endured, or no Cure expected.
And Men certainly have sunk their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to very gross, low, and absurd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of God, when in the Matter of
Sin they can make such false, and short
Reckonings with him, and their own
Hearts; for can they imagine, that God
has therefore forgot their Sins, because
they are not willing to remember them?
or will they measure his <hi>Pardon</hi> by their
own <hi>Oblivion?</hi> What pitifull Fig-leaves,
what senseless and ridiculous Shifts are
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:107166:209"/>
these, not able to <hi>silence,</hi> and much less
<hi>satisfie</hi> an accusing Conscience?</p>
            <p>But now for the better Management
of this Examination of our Past-lives,
we must throughly canvass them with
these and the like Questions.</p>
            <p>As for instance; Let a Man enquire
what Sins he has committed, and what
Breaches he has made upon those two
great standing Rules of Duty, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue,</hi>
and our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Divine Sermon
upon the Mount. Let him enquire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
what particular Aggravations ly upon
his Sins; as whether they have not been
committed against strong Reluctancy,
and Light of Conscience? after many
winning Calls of Mercy to reclaim, and
many terrible Warnings of Judgment
to affright him? Whether Resolutions,
Vows, and Protestations have not been
made against them? Whether they have
not been repeated frequently, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in obstinately? And lastly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the same Appetites to Sin have not
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:107166:210"/>
remained as active, and unmortified af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sacraments, as ever they had been
before?</p>
            <p>How important these Considerations,
and Heads of Enquiry are, all who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
any Thing, will easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
For this we must know, That
the very same Sin, as to the Nature of it,
stamp'd with any one of these Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is, in effect, not the same. And,
he who has sinned the same great Sin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
several times receiving the Sacrament,
must not think that God will accept him
under ten times greater Repentance, and
Contrition for it, than he brought with
him to that Duty formerly; Whether
God by his Grace will enable him to
rise up to such a Pitch, or no, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
but most certain, that both his
Work is harder, and his Danger greater
than it was, or could be at the first.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When a Man has by such a
close and rigorous Examination of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
found out the <hi>accursed Thing,</hi> and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:107166:210"/>
discovered his <hi>Sin;</hi> the next Thing in
order must be, to work up his Heart to
the utmost Hatred of it, and the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
Sorrow and Remorse for it. For,
<hi>Self-examination</hi> having first presented it
to the Thoughts, these naturally transmit,
and hand it over to the Passions. And this
introduces the next Ingredient of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Preparations, to wit, <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
Which arduous Work I will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
not now to <hi>begin,</hi> but to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed;</hi>
and that with special Reference
to Sins not repented of before, and yet
more especially to those new Scores which
we still have run our selves upon, since
the last preceding Sacrament. Which
Method, faithfully and constantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
must needs have an admirable
and mighty Effect upon the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and keep a Man from breaking,
or running behind-hand in his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Estate, which, without frequent
Accountings, he will hardly be able to
prevent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:107166:211"/>
But because this is a Duty of such
high Consequence, I would by all means
warn Men of one very common, and
yet very dangerous Mistake about it;
and that is, the taking of meer <hi>Sorrow
for Sin,</hi> for <hi>Repentance.</hi> It is indeed
a good Introduction to it; but the
Porch, though never so fair and spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
is not the House it self. Nothing
passes in the Accounts of God for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but Change of Life: <hi>Ceasing to
doe Evil, and doing Good,</hi> are the Two
great Integral Parts that complete this
Duty. <hi>For not to doe Evil,</hi> is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the sharpest Sorrow <hi>for having
done it; and to doe Good,</hi> is better, and
more valuable than both.</p>
            <p>When a Man has found out <hi>Sin</hi> in
his Actions, let him resolutely Arrest
it there; but let him also pursue it home
to his Inclinations, and dislodge it thence,
otherwise it will be all to little purpose;
for the Root being still left behind, it is
odds but in time it will shoot out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:107166:211"/>
Men befool themselves infinitely, when
by venting a few Sighs, or Groans, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Finger in the Eye, and whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
out a few melancholy Words;
and lastly, concluding all, with, <hi>I wish I
had never done so; and I am resolved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to doe so more;</hi> they will needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
themselves, that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented;
though, perhaps, in this very
thing, their Heart all the while deceives
them, and they neither really <hi>wish</hi> the
one, nor <hi>resolve</hi> the other.</p>
            <p>But whether they doe, or no, all true,
penitential Sorrow will, and must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
much further. It must force, and
make its way into the very inmost Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and Recesses of the Soul; it must
shake all the Powers of Sin, producing
in the Heart strong, and lasting Aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to Evil, and equal Dispositions to
Good, which, I must confess, are great
Things; But if the Sorrow which we
have been speaking of, carry us not so
far, let it express it self never so loudly,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:107166:212"/>
and passionately, and discharge it self in
never so many Shours of Tears, and
Vollies of Sighs; yet, by all this, it will
no more purge a man's Heart, than the
washing of his Hands can cleanse the
rottenness of his Bones. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When <hi>Self-examination</hi> has
both shewn us our Sin, and <hi>Repentance</hi>
has disowned and cast it out, the next
Thing naturally confequent upon this,
is with the highest Importunity to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
God's <hi>Pardon</hi> for the Guilt, and
his <hi>Grace</hi> against the Power of it: And
this brings in <hi>Prayer</hi> as the Third pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
for the Sacrament. A Duty,
upon which all the Blessings of both
Worlds are entailed. A Duty, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God himself, as the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit,
and noble Instrument of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
between Heaven and Earth. A
Duty, founded on Man's Essential de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon God, and so, in the
Ground and Reason of it, perpetual,
and consequently, in the Practice of it,
indispensable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:107166:212"/>
But I shall speak of it now only with
reference to the Sacrament. And so, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
other Graces may furnish us with
a <hi>Wedding-garment,</hi> it is certain that
<hi>Prayer</hi> must put it on. <hi>Prayer</hi> is that,
by which a Man engages all the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries
of Omnipotence it self against his
Sin; and is so utterly contrary to, and
inconsistent with it, that the same Heart
cannot long hold them both, but one
must soon quit possession of it to the
other; and, either Praying make a Man
leave off Sinning, or Sinning force him
to give over Praying.</p>
            <p>Every real Act of Hatred of Sin, is,
in the very Nature of the Thing, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Mortification of it; and, it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
possible for a Man to pray heartily
against his Sin, but he must at the same
time, hate it too. I know a Man may
think that he hates his Sin, when indeed
he does not; but then it is also as true,
that he does not sincerely pray against
it, whatsoever he may imagine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:107166:213"/>
Besides, since the very Life and Spirit
of <hi>Prayer</hi> consists in an ardent, vehement
Desire of the Thing prayed for; and,
since the Nature of the Soul is such, that
it strangely symbolizes with the Thing
it mightily desires; it is evident, That
if a Man would have a devout, humble,
Sin-abhorring, Self-denying Frame of
Spirit, he cannot take a more efficacious
course to attain it, than by Praying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into it. And so close a Connexion
has this Duty with the Sacrament, that
whatsoever we receive in the Sacrament,
is properly in answer to our Prayers.
And consequently, we may with great
assurance conclude, That he who is not
frequently <hi>upon his Knees,</hi> before he
comes to that holy Table, <hi>Kneels</hi> to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little purpose when he is there. But
then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because <hi>Prayer</hi> is not only
one of the highest, and hardest Duties
in it self, but ought to be more than
ordinarily servent and vigorous before
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:107166:213"/>
the Sacrament: Let the <hi>Body</hi> be also
called in, as an Assistant to the <hi>Soul,</hi> and
<hi>Abstinence</hi> and <hi>Fasting</hi> added to promote
and heighten her Devotions. <hi>Prayer</hi> is
a kind of <hi>Wrestling with God;</hi> and, he
who would win the Prize at that Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
must be severely <hi>dieted</hi> for that
purpose.</p>
            <p>The truth is, <hi>Fasting</hi> was ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by the Church, in all Ages,
as a singular Instrument of Religion,
and a particular Preparative to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And hardly was there ever any
thing Great, or Heroick, either done or
attempted in Religion, without it. Thus,
when <hi>Moses received the Law from God,
it was with Fasting,</hi> Deut. 9. 9. When
<hi>Christ</hi> entred upon the great Office of
his Mediatorship, it was with <hi>Fasting,
Matth.</hi> 4. 2. And when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
were separated to that high and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Charge of Preaching to the <hi>Gentiles,
Acts</hi> 13. 2. still it was managed with
<hi>Fasting.</hi> And, we know, the Rubrick
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:107166:214"/>
of our own Church always, almost, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
a <hi>Fast</hi> to prepare us for a <hi>Festival.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bodily Abstinence is certainly a great
help to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the Experience of
all wise and good Men has ever found
it so. The Ways of Nature, and the
Methods of Grace, are vastly different.
Good Men themselves are never so sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
as in the midst of their Jollities;
nor so fatally over-taken, and caught,
as when the <hi>Table is made the Snare.</hi> Even
our first Parents <hi>ate</hi> themselves out of
Paradise; and <hi>Iob's Children</hi> junketted
and feasted together often, but the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
cost them dear at last. The
<hi>Heart of the Wise</hi> (says <hi>Solomon) is in the
House of Mourning,</hi> and the House of
<hi>Fasting</hi> adjoyns to it.</p>
            <p>In a word, <hi>Fasting</hi> is the Diet of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
the Food and Refection of Souls,
and the richest, and highest Aliment of
Grace. And, he who Fasts for the sake
of Religion, <hi>Hungers and Thirsts after
Righteousness</hi> without a Metaphor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:107166:214"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Since every Devout Prayer is
designed to ascend, and <hi>fly up</hi> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
as <hi>Fasting</hi> (according to St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin's</hi>
Allusion) has given it <hi>one Wing,</hi>
so let <hi>Alms-giving</hi> to the Poor supply it
with another. And both these together,
will not only carry it up Triumphant
to Heaven, but, if need require, bring
Heaven it self down to the Devout Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who sends it thither; As, while <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
was <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Praying,</hi> (to which
he still joyned <hi>giving Alms,</hi>) an Angel
from Heaven was dispatched to him with
this happy Message, <hi>Acts 10. 4. Thy
Prayers, and thine Alms, are come up for
a Memorial before God.</hi> And nothing,
certainly, can give a greater Efficacy to
<hi>Prayer,</hi> and a more peculiar Fitness for
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> than an Hearty, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
Practice of this Duty; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which all that has been mentioned
hitherto is nothing but Wind and Air,
Pageantry, and Hypocrisie: For, if there
be any truer Measure of a Man, than
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:107166:215"/>
               <hi>by what he does;</hi> it must be, <hi>by what he
gives.</hi> He, who is truly Pious, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it a <hi>Wedding-supper</hi> to Feed the
Hungry, and a <hi>Wedding-garment</hi> to
Cloath the Naked. And, God and
Man will find it a very unfit <hi>Garment</hi>
for such a purpose, which has not in it a
<hi>Purse,</hi> or <hi>Pocket</hi> for the Poor.</p>
            <p>But, so far are some from <hi>considering
the Poor</hi> before the Sacrament, that they
have been observed to give nothing to
the Poor, even at the Sacrament: And
those such, that if Rich Cloaths might
pass for a <hi>Wedding-garment,</hi> none could
appear better fitted for such a Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
than themselves; yet some such, I
say, I my self have seen at a Communion,
drop nothing into the Poor's Bason.</p>
            <p>But, good God! What is the Heart
of such Worldlings made of, and what
a Mind doe they bring with them to so
Holy an Ordinance! An Ordinance, in
which none can be qualified <hi>to receive,</hi>
whose Heart does not serve them also <hi>to
give.</hi>

From such indeed as have nothing,
God expects nothing; but, where God
has given (as I may say) with both
Hands, and Men return with None,
such must know, that the Poor have an
<hi>Action of Debt</hi> against them, and that
God Himself will undertake, and prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their Suit for them; and if he does,
since they could not find in their Hearts
to proportion <hi>their Charity to their Estates;</hi>
nothing can be more just, than for God
to proportion <hi>their Estates to their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
and, by so doing, he cannot well
give them a shrewder, and a shorter
Cut.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let such know fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
That whosoever dares, upon so
Sacred, and Solemn an Occasion, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Altar, with Bowels so shut
up, as to leave nothing behind him there
for the Poor, shall be sure to carry
<hi>something</hi> away with him from thence,
<hi>which will doe</hi> him but little good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="418" facs="tcp:107166:216"/>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Since the <hi>Charity</hi> of the <hi>Hand</hi>
signifies but little, unless it springs form
the <hi>Heart,</hi> and flows through the <hi>Mouth,</hi>
let the Pious Communicant, both in
<hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Tongue, Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Speech,</hi>
put on a Charitable, Friendly, Christian
Temper of Mind, and Carriage towards
all. <hi>Wrath and Envy, Malice and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting,</hi>
and the like, are direct Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
to the very Spirit of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and fit a Man for the Sacrament,
just as much as a Stomach over-flowed
with Gall would help him to digest his
Meat. St. <hi>Paul</hi> often Rebukes and Schools
such Disturbers of the World very
sharply, correcting a base Humour by
a very generous Rule, <hi>Phil. 2. 3. Let
each</hi> (says he) <hi>esteem others better than
themselves.</hi> No Man, doubtless, shall
ever be <hi>Condemned</hi> of God for <hi>not
Iudging</hi> his Brother: For, be thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or Neighbour never so wicked and
ungodly, satisfie thy self with this, That
another's Wickedness shall never Damn
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:107166:216"/>
thee; but thy own Bitterness, and Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
may; and, continued in, certainly
will: Rather let his want of Grace give
thee occasion to exercise Thine, (if thou
hast any,) in Thinking and Speaking bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of him, than he deserves: And, if
thy <hi>Charity</hi> proves <hi>mistaken,</hi> assure thy
self, that God will accept the <hi>Charity,</hi>
and over-look the <hi>Mistake.</hi> But if in
Judging him whom thou hast nothing
to doe with, thou chancest to Judge one
way, and God and Truth to Judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
take heed of that Dreadfull Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
where it will not be enough to
say, That <hi>I thought this,</hi> or <hi>I heard that;</hi>
and, where no Man's mistake will be
able to warrant an unjust Surmise, and
much less justifie a false Censure. Such
would find it much better for them to
retreat inwards, and view themselves in
the Law of God and their own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
and, that will tell them <hi>their
own</hi> impartially, that will fetch off all
their <hi>paint,</hi> and shew them a <hi>foul Face</hi>
               <pb n="420" facs="tcp:107166:217"/>
in a <hi>true Glass.</hi> Let them read over their
Catechism, and lay aside <hi>Spight</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulence,
Gossipping</hi> and <hi>Medling, Calumny</hi>
and <hi>Detraction;</hi> and let not all about
them be Villains and Reprobates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they themselves are Envious and
Forlorn, Idle and Malicious: Such Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
are to be lookt upon by all sober
Christians, as the very Cankers of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Shame of any Religion; and
so far from being fit to come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
that really they are not fit to
come to Church; and would much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
become the <hi>House of Correction,</hi> than
the <hi>House of Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, as Custom in Sin makes
People <hi>blind,</hi> and Blindness makes them
<hi>bold,</hi> none come more confidently to
the Sacrament than such Wretches. But
when I consider the pure and blessed
Body of our Saviour, passing through the
<hi>open Sepulchres of such Throats,</hi> into the
noisome Receptacles of their boiling, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Breasts, it seems to me a lively,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:107166:217"/>
but sad Representation of Christ's being
<hi>first buried, and then descending into Hell.</hi>
Let this Diabolical Leaven therefore be
purged out; and, while such pretend to
be so busie in cleansing their <hi>Hearts,</hi> let
them not forget to wash their <hi>Mouths</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly</hi> and <hi>Lastly:</hi> As it is to be
supposed, that the Pious Communicant
has all along carried on, so let him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
in the Issue, close his Preparatory
Work with Reading and Meditation. Of
which, since the Time will not serve me
to speak more now, I shall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
this, That they are Duties of so
near an Import to the Well-being of the
Soul, that the proper Office of Reading
is, to <hi>take</hi> in its Spiritual food, and of
Meditation, to <hi>digest</hi> it.</p>
            <p>And now, I hope, that whosoever
shall in the Sincerity of his Heart acquit
himself as to all the foregoing Duties,
and thereby prepare and adorn himself
to meet and converse with his Saviour
at this Divine Feast, shall never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costed
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:107166:218"/>
with the Thunder of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Increpation from him, <hi>Friend, how
camest thou in hither, not having a Wedding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, because I am very sensible, that
all the particular Instances of Duty, which
may one way or other contribute to the
fitting of Men for this <hi>Great one,</hi> can
hardly be assigned, and much less equally
and universally applied, where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Men are so very different, I
shall gather them all into this one plain,
full, and comprehensive Rule; namely,
<hi>That</hi> all those Duties which Common
Christianity always obliges a Christian
to, ought most eminently, and with an
higher and more exalted pitch of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
to be performed by him before
the Sacrament; and convertibly, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Dutyes Divines prescribe to be
observed by him with a peculiar Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and Application of Mind upon
this occasion, ought in their proportion,
to be practised by him, through the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:107166:218"/>
whole Course of his Christian Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
            <p>And this is a <hi>solid and sure Rule.</hi> A
Rule, that will never deceive or lurch
the sincere Communicant. A Rule, that
by adding <hi>Discretion</hi> to <hi>Devotion,</hi> will
both keep him from being humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
singular, and phantastick in his
Preparations before the Sacrament, and
(which is worse, and must fatally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel
all again) from being (as most
are) loose and remiss after it; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that as soon as the Sacrament is
over, their great Business is done, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
indeed it is but begun.</p>
            <p>And now I fear, that, as I have been
too long upon the whole, so I have
been but too brief upon so many, and
those such weighty Particulars. But I
hope you will supply this Defect, by
enlarging upon them in your Practice:
And make up the Omissions of the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
by the Meditations of the Closet. And
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:107166:219"/>
God direct and assist us all in so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Work.</p>
            <p>To whom be rendred, and ascribed, as is
most due, all Praise, Might, Majesty,
and Dominion, both now, and for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THese Words contain in them Two
things:</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>Wo</hi> denounced; and,</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Sin</hi> for which it is denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
to wit, <hi>the calling Evil good, and
Good evil.</hi> Which Expression may be
taken Two ways:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In a <hi>Iudicial,</hi> and more restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Sense: As it signifies the Pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of a <hi>Guilty</hi> Person <hi>Innocent,</hi> and an
<hi>Innocent Guilty,</hi> in the Course of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But this I take to be too Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
to reach the Design of the Words
here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It may be taken in a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
and more enlarged Sense; as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a Mis-representation of the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:107166:221"/>
of Things, and Actions, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Apprehensions of Men, abusing
their Minds with false Notions; and so
by this Artifice making <hi>Evil</hi> pass for
<hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> for <hi>Evil,</hi> in all the great
Concerns of Life. Where, by <hi>Good,</hi> I
question not, but <hi>Good</hi> Morally so called,
<hi>Bonum Honestum</hi> ought (chiefly at least)
to be understood; and, that the Good
of <hi>Profit,</hi> or <hi>Pleasure,</hi> the <hi>Bonum Utile,</hi>
or <hi>Iucundum,</hi> hardly come into any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
here, as things extremely below
the principal design of the Spirit of God
in this place.</p>
            <p>It is wonderfull to consider, that, since
<hi>Good</hi> is the natural and proper object,
which all humane Choice is carried out to;
and <hi>Evil,</hi> that, which with all its Might
it shuns, and flies from; And, since with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
there is that Controlling Worth and
Beauty in Goodness, that, as such, the
<hi>Will</hi> cannot but like, and desire it; and,
on the other side, that odious Deformity
in Vice, that it never so much as offers
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:107166:221"/>
it self to the Affections, or Practice of
Mankind, but under the Disguise and
Colours of the other; And, since all this
is easily discernible by the ordinary Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of the Understanding; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
since nothing passes into the Choice
of the Will, but as it comes conveyed,
and warranted by the Understanding, as
worthy of its choice; I say, it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
to consider, that notwithstanding
all this, the Lives and Practices of the
generality of Men (in which Men cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
should be most in earnest) are
almost wholly took up in a passionate
Pursuit of what is <hi>Evil,</hi> and in an equal
Neglect, if not also an Abhorrence, of
what is <hi>Good.</hi> This is certainly so;
and Experience, which is neither to be
confuted, nor denied, does every minute
prove the sad Truth of this Assertion.</p>
            <p>But now, what should be the Cause
of all this? For, so great, so constant, and
so general a Practice must needs have,
not only a Cause, but also a great, a
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:107166:222"/>
constant, and a <hi>general Cause;</hi> a <hi>Cause</hi>
every way Commensurate to such an
<hi>Effect:</hi> And <hi>this Cause</hi> must of necessity
be from one of those Two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Powers of the Soul, the <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or the <hi>Will.</hi> As for the <hi>Will;</hi> though
its Liberty be such, that a sutable, or
proper <hi>Good</hi> being proposed to it, it has
a Power to refuse, or not to chuse it;
yet it has no Power to chuse <hi>Evil,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
absolutely as <hi>Evil;</hi> this being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
against the Nature, and Natural
Method of its Workings.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, it is but too manifest
that things <hi>Evil,</hi> extremely <hi>Evil,</hi> are both
readily chosen, and eagerly pursued and
practised by it. And therefore, this must
needs be from that other governing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the Soul, the <hi>Understanding,</hi>
which represents to the <hi>Will</hi> things really
<hi>Evil,</hi> under the Notion and Character
of <hi>Good.</hi> And this, this is the true Source
and Original of this great Mischief. The
<hi>Will</hi> chuses, follows and embraces, things
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:107166:222"/>
Evil, and destructive; but it is, because
the <hi>Understanding</hi> first tells it, that they
are <hi>good, and wholesome, and fit to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen</hi>
by it. One Man gives another a
Cup of Poyson, a thing as terrible as
Death; but, at the same time, he tells
him, that it is a Cordial, and so he
drinks it off, and dies.</p>
            <p>From the beginning of the World, to
this day, there was never any great Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy
acted by Men, but it was in the
strength of some great Fallacy put upon
their Minds by a false representation of
<hi>Evil</hi> for <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Good</hi> for <hi>Evil. In the
day, that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
die,</hi> says God to <hi>Adam;</hi> and so long
as <hi>Adam</hi> believed this, he did not eat.
But, says the Devil, In the Day that thou
eatest thereof, thou shalt be so far from
<hi>surely dying,</hi> that thou shalt be Immortal,
and from a Man, grow into an Angel;
and upon this different account of the
thing, he presently took the Fruit, and
ate Mortality, Misery, and Destruction
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:107166:223"/>
to himself, and his whole Posterity.</p>
            <p>And now, can there be a <hi>Wo</hi> or <hi>Curse</hi>
in all the Stores and Magazines of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
equal to the Malignity of such a
Practice; of which one single Instance
could involve all Mankind, past, present,
and to come, in one universal, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
confusion? God commanded,
and <hi>told Man what was Good,</hi> but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
fur-named it <hi>Evil,</hi> and thereby baffled
the Command, turned the World topsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turvy,
and brought a new Chaos upon
the whole Creation.</p>
            <p>But that I may give you a more full
Discussion of the sense and design of the
Words, I shall doe it under these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Particulars: As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I shall give you some general
Account of the Nature of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi>
and the Reason upon which they
are founded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall shew that the <hi>Way</hi> by
which <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> commonly operate
upon the Mind of Man, is by those
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:107166:223"/>
respective <hi>Names</hi> or <hi>Appellations</hi> by which
they are notified, and conveyed to the
Mind. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> I shall shew the
<hi>Mischief,</hi> directly, naturally, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
following from the Misappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and Confusion of those Names.</p>
            <p>And, I hope, by going over all these
Particulars, you may receive some tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
satisfaction about this great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which we have now before us.</p>
            <p>1. And first for the <hi>Nature of Good
and Evil,</hi> what they are, and upon what
they are founded. The Knowledge of
this I look upon as the Foundation and
Ground-work of all those Rules, that
either Moral Philosophy, or Divinity,
can give for the Direction of the Lives
and Practices of Men; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ought to be reckoned as a first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
and, that such an one, that, for
ought I see, the through <hi>Speculation</hi> of
Good, will be found much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
than the <hi>Practice.</hi> But when we
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:107166:224"/>
shall have once given some Account of
the Nature of <hi>Good,</hi> that of <hi>Evil</hi> will be
known by Consequence; as being only
a Privation, or Absence of <hi>Good,</hi> in a
Subject capable of it, and proper for
it.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Good</hi> in the general Nature,
and Notion of it, over and above the
bare <hi>Being</hi> of a Thing, Connotes also
a certain <hi>sutableness or agreeableness of it
to some other thing:</hi> According to which
<hi>general Notion</hi> of Good applied to the
<hi>particular Nature</hi> of Moral Goodness,
(upon which only we now insist,) a
Thing or Action is said to be <hi>Morally
Good</hi> or <hi>Evil,</hi> as it is agreeable, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
to <hi>Right Reason,</hi> or to a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Nature: And, as <hi>Right Reason</hi> is
nothing else but the Understanding, or
Mind of Man, discoursing, and judging
of Things truly, and as they are in
themselves; and (as all <hi>Truth</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
the same; that Proposition,
which is true at any time, being so for
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:107166:224"/>
ever) so it must follow, That the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Goodness or Evil of men's Actions,</hi> which
consist in their Conformity, or Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to <hi>Right Reason,</hi> must be also
Eternal, Necessary, and Unchangeable.
So that, as that, which is <hi>Right Reason</hi>
at any Time, or in any Case, is always
<hi>Right Reason</hi> with relation to the same
Time, and Case; In like manner, that
which is Morally <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Evil,</hi> at any
Time, or in any Case, (since it takes
its whole measure from <hi>Right Reason</hi>)
must be also Eternally, and Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
a <hi>Moral Good,</hi> or <hi>Evil;</hi> with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to that Time, and to that Case.
For Propositions concerning the <hi>Goodness,</hi>
as well as concerning the <hi>Truth</hi> of
Things, are <hi>necessary,</hi> and <hi>perpetual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say, May not the same
Action, as for instance, <hi>the killing of a
Man,</hi> be sometimes Morally Good, and
sometimes Morally Evil? To Wit, <hi>Good,</hi>
when it is the Execution of Justice upon
a Malefactor; and <hi>Evil,</hi> when it is the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:107166:225"/>
taking away the Life of an Innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</p>
            <p>To this I Answer: That this indeed
is true of Actions, considered in their
General Nature or Kind, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in their Particular, Individual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
For generally speaking; to take
away the Life of a Man, is neither Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<hi>Good,</hi> nor Morally <hi>Evil,</hi> but capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being either, as the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Things shall determine it; but
every particular Act of Killing, is of
necessity accompanied with, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
by several Circumstances, which
actually, and unavoidably constitute, and
denominate it either <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil.</hi> And
that, which being performed under such,
and such Circumstances, is <hi>Morally Good,</hi>
cannot possibly, under the same Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
ever be <hi>Morally Evil.</hi> And
so on the contrary.</p>
            <p>From whence we inferr the Villainous
falsehood of Two Assertions, held and
maintained by some persons, and too
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:107166:225"/>
much countenanced by some others in
the World. As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil, Honest</hi>
and <hi>Dishonest,</hi> are not Qualities existing
or inherent in Things themselves, but
only founded in the Opinions of Men
concerning Things. So that any Thing
or Action, that has gained the General
Approbation of any People, or Society
of Men, ought, in respect of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to be esteemed <hi>Morally Good,</hi> or
<hi>Honest;</hi> and, whatsoever falls under their
general Disapprobation, ought, upon the
same account, to be reckoned <hi>Morally
Evil,</hi> or <hi>Dishonest;</hi> which also, they would
seem to prove from the very signification
of the word <hi>Honestus;</hi> which, originally
and strictly, signifies no more than <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
and is but a Derivative from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>
which signifies <hi>Credit</hi> or <hi>Honour;</hi>
and, according to the Opinion of some,
(we know) That is lodged only in the
Esteem and Thoughts of those who pay
it, and not in the Thing, or Person,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:107166:226"/>
whom it is paid to. Thus for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Thieving,</hi> or <hi>Robbing,</hi> was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongst the <hi>Spartans</hi> a gallant, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
and a creditable Thing; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
according to the Principle which
we have mentioned, <hi>Thievery,</hi> amongst
the <hi>Spartans,</hi> was a practice Morally
<hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Honest.</hi> Thus also, both with
the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> it was held
a magnanimous, and highly laudable
Act, for a man under any great or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable
misery, or distress, to put an
end to his own Life; and, accordingly,
with those who had such Thoughts of
it, that, which we call Self-murther, was
properly <hi>a good,</hi> an <hi>honest,</hi> and a <hi>vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Action. And, persons of the highest,
and most acknowledged Probity, and
Vertue amongst them; such as <hi>Marcus
Cato,</hi> and <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> actually did
it, and stand celebrated both by their
Orators and Historians, for so doing.
And I could also instance in other Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a souler, and more unnatural Hue,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:107166:226"/>
which yet from the Approbation and
Credit they have found in some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and Places, have passed for good
Morality in those places: But, out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to Common Humanity, as well as
Divinity, I shall pass them over. And
thus much for the first Assertion, or
Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The second Opinion, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
is, That <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil, Honest</hi>
and <hi>Dishonest,</hi> are Originally founded in
the Laws and Constitutions of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Civil Power, enjoyning some
Things, or Actions, and prohibiting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
So that when any thing is found
conducing to the Welfare of the Publick,
and thereupon comes to be enacted by
Governours into a Law, it is forthwith
thereby rendred <hi>Morally Good</hi> and <hi>Honest;</hi>
and, on the contrary, <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Dishonest,</hi>
when, upon its Contrariety to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Welfare, it stands prohibited and
condemned by the same publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="440" facs="tcp:107166:227"/>
This was the Opinion heretofore of
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> as it is represented by <hi>Gassen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus;</hi>
who understood his Notions too
well, to misrepresent them. And lately
of <hi>one</hi> amongst our selves, a less Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,
though the greater Heathen of
the two, the Infamous Author of the
<hi>Leviathan.</hi> And the like lewd, scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and immoral Doctrine, or worse
(if possible) may be found in some
Writers, of another kind of Note and
Character; whom, one would have
thought, not only Religion, but Shame
of the World might have taught better
things.</p>
            <p>Such as, for instance, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
who, in his 4th. Book and 5th.
Chapter, <hi>De Pontifice Romano,</hi> has this
monstrous Passage: <q>
                  <hi>That, if the Pope
should through Error or Mistake command
Vices, and prohibit Vertues, the Church
would be bound in Conscience to believe
Vice to be Good, and Vertue Evil.</hi>
               </q> I
shall give you the whole Passage in his
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:107166:227"/>
own Words to a Tittle: <q>
                  <hi>Fides Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica
docet omnem virtutem esse Bonam,
omne vitium esse Malum. Si autem erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
Papa, praecipiendo vitia vel prohibendo
virtutes, teneretur Ecclesia credere vitia
esse Bona &amp; virtutes Malas, nisi vellet
contra Conscientiam peccare.</hi>
               </q> Good God!
that any thing that wears the Name of
a <hi>Christian,</hi> or but of a <hi>Man,</hi> should
venture to own such a villainous, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent,
and blasphemous Assertion in the
face of the World, as this! What? <hi>must
Murther, Adultery, Theft, Fraud, Extortion,
perjury, Drunkenness, Rebellion,</hi> and the
like, pass for good and commendable
Actions, and fit to be practised? And,
<hi>Mercy, Chastity, Iustice, Truth, Temperance,
Loyalty and Sincere Dealing,</hi> be accounted
things <hi>utterly evil, immoral,</hi> and not to be
followed by Men, in case the Pope, who
is generally a weak, and almost always
a wicked Man, should by his mistake,
and <hi>infallible ignorance,</hi> command the
former, and forbid the latter? Did
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:107166:228"/>
Christ himself ever assume such a Power,
as to alter the Morality of Actions, and
to transform Vice into Vertue, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
into Vice by his bare Word? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
never did a grosser Paradox, or a
wickeder Sentence drop from the Mouth
or Pen of any mortal Man, since Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Religion had any Being in the
World.</p>
            <p>And, I must confess, I have often
with great Amazement wondred how it
could possibly come from a Person of
so great a Reputation both for Learning,
and Vertue too, as the World allows
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> to have been. But, when Men
give themselves over to the Defence of
wicked Interests, and false Propositions,
it is just with God to smite the greatest
Abilities with the greatest Infatuations.</p>
            <p>But as for these Two Positions, or
Assertions; <hi>That the Moral Good or Evil,
the Honesty or Dishonesty of humane Actions
should depend either upon the Opinions, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Laws of Men:</hi> They are certainly
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:107166:228"/>
false in <hi>themselves,</hi> because they are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
absurd in <hi>their Consequences.</hi> Some
of which are such as these. As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> If the Moral Goodness, or Evil
of men's Actions were Originally found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, and so proceeded wholly from
the Opinions, or Laws of Men, then it
would follow, that they must change
and vary according to the Change, and
difference of the Opinions and Laws of
Men: And consequently, that the same
Action, under exactly the same Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
may be morally Good <hi>one day,</hi>
and morally Evil <hi>another;</hi> and morally
Good in <hi>one place,</hi> and morally Evil in
<hi>another:</hi> For as much as the same Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Authority may enact or make a
Law, commanding such or such an
Action to day, and a quite contrary
Law forbidding the same Action to
morrow; and the very same Action,
under the same Circumstances, may be
commanded by Law in <hi>one Country,</hi> and
prohibited by Law in <hi>another.</hi> Which being
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:107166:229"/>
so, the Consequence is manifest, and the
Absurdity of the Consequent intolerable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Moral <hi>Goodness,</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi>
of men's Actions, depended Originally
upon humane Laws, then those Laws
themselves could neither be morally
Good nor Evil: The Consequence is
evident; Because those Laws are not
commanded, or prohibited by any <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent</hi>
humane Laws; And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
if the Moral Goodness, or Evil
of any Act were to be derived only
from a <hi>precedent</hi> humane Law, Laws
themselves, not supposing a dependance
upon other <hi>precedent</hi> humane Laws,
could have no <hi>Moral Goodness,</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> in
them. Which to assert of any humane
Act (such as all humane Laws essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
are, and must be) is certainly a
very gross Absurdity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Moral Goodness, or
Evil of men's Actions were sufficiently
derived from humane Laws, or Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions;
then, upon supposal, that a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:107166:229"/>
Law</hi> should (as it often does) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what is prohibited by humane
Laws, and prohibit what is commanded
by them, it would follow, that either
such Commands and Prohibitions of
the Divine Law doe not at all affect
the Actions of Men in point of their
Morality, so as to render them either
Good or Evil, or, that the same Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
at the same time, may, in respect of
the Divine Law Commanding it, be <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Good;</hi> and, in respect of an humane
Law forbidding it, be <hi>Morally Evil.</hi> Than
which consequence, nothing can be more
clear, nor withall more absurd.</p>
            <p>And many more of the like nature, I
could easily draw forth, and lay before
you. Every false Principle or Proposition
being sure to be attended with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
train of Absurdities.</p>
            <p>But, as to the Subject-matter now in
hand; so far is the Morality of <hi>humane</hi>
Actions, as to the Goodness or Evil of
them, from being founded in any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:107166:230"/>
Law, that in very many, and those
the principal Instances of humane <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
it is not Originally founded in, or
derived from so much as any <hi>Positive,
Divine</hi> Law. There being a <hi>Ius naturale</hi>
certainly antecedent to all <hi>Ius positivum,</hi>
either Humane or Divine; and that such,
as results from the very Nature and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Things, as they stand in such a
certain Habitude, or Relation to one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
To which Relation, whatsoever
is done agreeably, is Morally and Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
<hi>Good;</hi> and, whatsoever is done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
is, at the same rate, <hi>Morally
Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I shall exemplifie in those
Two grand, comprehensive, Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which Man is for ever obliged to,
<hi>His Duty towards God, and his Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first, for his Duty towards God;
which is, <hi>To love and obey him with all his
Heart, and all his Soul.</hi> It is certain, that
for a rational, intelligent Creature to
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:107166:230"/>
conform himself to the Will of God in
all things, carries in it a moral Rectitude,
or Goodness; and, to disobey or oppose
his Will in any thing, imports a moral
Obliquity, before God ever deals forth
any particular Law, or Command to
such a Creature; There being a general
Obligation upon Man to obey all God's
Laws, <hi>whensoever they shall be declared,</hi>
before any particular Instance of Law
comes actually to be declared. But now
whence is this? Why; from that <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
sutableness,</hi> which Obedience has to the
Relation which is between a Rational
Creature, and his Creator. Nothing in
Nature being more irrational, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
and consequently more immoral,
than for an Intelligent Being to oppose,
or disobey that Soveraign, Supreme <hi>Will,</hi>
which gave him that Being, and has with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
the sole and absolute disposal of him
in all his concerns. So that there needs
no positive Law, or Sanction of God to
stamp an Obliquity upon such a disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:107166:231"/>
Since it cleaves to it Essentially,
and by way of Natural result from it,
upon the account of that utter unsuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
which Disobedience has to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
which Man naturally and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
stands in towards his Maker.</p>
            <p>And then, in the next place, for <hi>his
Duty to his Neighbour.</hi> The whole of
which is comprized in that great Rule,
<hi>of doing, as a Man would be done by.</hi> We
may truly affirm, that the <hi>Morality of this
Rule</hi> does not Originally derive it self
from those words of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.
7. 12. What soever ye would that Men should
doe unto you, doe ye even so unto them:</hi> No,
nor yet from <hi>Moses</hi> or the Prophets; but
it is as old as <hi>Adam,</hi> and bears date with
humane Nature it self; as springing from
that Primitive Relation of <hi>Equality,</hi> which
all men, as <hi>fellow Creatures</hi> and <hi>fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
to the same supreme Lord, bear to
one another, in respect of that common
Right, which every man has <hi>equally</hi> to his
Life, and to the proper Comforts of
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:107166:231"/>
Life; and consequently, to all things
naturally necessary to the support of
both.</p>
            <p>Now, whatsoever one man has a
Right to keep, or possess, no other man
can have a Right to take from him. So
that no man has a Right to expect that
<hi>from,</hi> or to do that <hi>to</hi> another, which
that other has not an equal Right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from, and to doe to him. Which
<hi>Parity of Right,</hi> as to all things purely
Natural, being undoubtedly the Result
of Nature it self, can any thing be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from thence more conformable to
Reason, and consequently of a greater
moral Rectitude, then that such an <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Right</hi> should also cause an <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Behaviour,</hi> between Man and Man,
as to all those mutual Offices, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
in which Life, and the Happiness
of Life are concerned? Nothing certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can shine out, and shew it self by the
meer Light of Reason, as an higher, and
more unquestionable piece of Morality
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:107166:232"/>
than <hi>this,</hi> nor as a more confessed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation
from Morality than the contrary
Practice.</p>
            <p>From all which discourse, I think we
may without presumption conclude, that
the <hi>Rationes Boni, &amp; Mali,</hi> the <hi>Nature
of Good and Evil,</hi> as to the principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of both, spring from that Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Habitude, or Relation, which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of one thing bears to another by
vertue of that Order which they stand pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in, here in the World, by the very
Law and Condition of their Creation;
and, for that reason, doe and must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
all positive Laws, Sanctions, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
whatsoever. <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> are
in Morality, as the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> are in
the Frame of the World; <hi>founded</hi> in, and
<hi>divided</hi> by that fixt, and unalterable Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
which they have respectively in the
whole Body of the Universe: Or, as the
<hi>Right</hi> Hand is discriminated from the
<hi>Left,</hi> by a natural, necessary, and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to-be-confounded
Distinction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="451" facs="tcp:107166:232"/>
And thus I have done with the <hi>First
Thing</hi> proposed, and given you such an
account of the <hi>Nature of Good and Evil,</hi>
as the measure of the present Exercise
and Occasion would allow. Pass we
now to the</p>
            <p>2<hi>d</hi> Which is to shew, That the way
by which <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> generally <hi>operate
upon the Mind of Man, is by those Words
or Names by which they are notified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to the Mind.</hi> Words are the Signs
and Symbols of Things; and, as in Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts,
Ciphers and Figures pass for
real Summs; so in the course of humane
Affairs, Words and Names pass for
Things themselves. For Things, or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
cannot enter into the <hi>Mind,</hi> as they
subsist in themselves, and by their own
natural bulk pass into the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but they are taken in by their
<hi>Idea's,</hi> their <hi>Notions</hi> or <hi>Resemblances;</hi> which
imprinting themselves after a <hi>spiritual,
immaterial manner,</hi> in the Imagination;
and from thence, under a further <hi>Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="452" facs="tcp:107166:233"/>
passing into the Intellect, are by
that expressed by certain Words or
Names found out, and invented by the
Mind, for the Communication of its
Conceptions, or Thoughts to others.
So that as <hi>Conceptions</hi> are the Images, or
Resemblances of Things to the Mind
within it self. In like manner are Words
or Names the Marks, Tokens or Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
of those Conceptions to the
Minds of them whom we converse with:
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
being the known Maxim laid
down by the Philosopher, as the first
and most fundamental Rule of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>This therefore is certain, That in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Life, or Conversation, <hi>Words</hi> stand
for <hi>Things;</hi> the common business of the
World not being capable of being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
otherwise. For by these, Men
come to know one another's Minds. By
these, they Covenant and Confederate.
By these, they Buy and Sell, they Deal
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:107166:233"/>
and Traffick. In short, Words are the
great Instruments both of <hi>Practice</hi> and
<hi>Design;</hi> which, for the most part, move
wholly in the strength of them. For as
much as it is the Nature of Man both
to <hi>Will and to doe,</hi> according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
he has of the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> of
those Things that come before him; and
to take up his Perswasions according to
the Representations made to him of those
Qualities, by their respective Names, or
Appellations.</p>
            <p>This is the true and natural Account
of this matter; and it is all that I shall
remark upon this second Head. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
now to the</p>
            <p>3<hi>d.</hi> Which is, to <hi>shew the mischief which
directly, naturally, and unavoidably follows
from the Misapplication and Confusion of
those Names.</hi> And, in order to this, I
shall premise these Two Considerations.</p>
            <p>1. That the generality of Mankind
is wholly and absolutely governed by
<hi>Words</hi> and Names: <hi>Without;</hi> nay, for
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:107166:234"/>
the most part, even <hi>against</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Men have of Things. The Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
or Common Rout, like a Drove
of Sheep, or an Herd of Oxen, may
be managed by any Noise, or Cry,
which their Drivers shall accustom them
to.</p>
            <p>And, he who will set up for a skilfull
manager of the Rabble, so long <hi>as they
have but Ears to hear,</hi> needs never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
whether they have any <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
whereby to judge; but with two or
three popular, empty Words, such as <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Superstition, Right of the Subject, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience, Lord Iesus Christ</hi> well tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and humour'd; may whistle them back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and forwards, upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
till he is weary; and get up upon
their Backs when he is so.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>meaning</hi> of the Word it self,
that may shift for it self: And, as for
<hi>the Sence and Reason of it,</hi> that has little
or nothing to doe here; only let it
sound full and round, and chime right
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:107166:234"/>
to the Humour, which is at present a
Gog, (just as a big, long, rattling Name
is said to command even Adoration from
a <hi>Spaniard,</hi>) and, no doubt, with this
powerfull, senseless Engine the <hi>Rabble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driver,</hi>
shall be able to carry all before
him, or to draw all after him, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
For, a plausible, insignificant Word,
in the mouth of an expert Demagogue,
is a dangerous and a dreadfull Weapon.</p>
            <p>You know, when <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Army mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinied,
and grew troublesome, no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from Interest, or Reason, could
satisfie or appease them: But, as soon as
he gave them the Appellation of <hi>Quiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
the Tumult was immediately hush'd;
and all were quiet and content, and took
that <hi>one Word</hi> in good payment for all.
Such is the trivial slightness and levity of
most minds. And indeed, take any Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Soul of Man, while it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant,
and a-float, and, just in the
critical height of it, nick it with some
<hi>lucky,</hi> or <hi>unlucky</hi> Word, and you may
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:107166:235"/>
as certainly over-rule it to your own
purpose, as a spark of Fire, falling upon
Gun-powder, will infallibly blow it
up.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, he who shall duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
these matters, will find that there
is a certain <hi>bewitchery,</hi> or fascination in
Words, which makes them operate with
a force beyond what we can naturally
give an account of. For, would not a
man think, ill Deeds, and shrewd Turns,
should reach further, and strike deeper
than ill Words? And yet many Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
might be given, in which Men have
much more easily pardoned ill Things
<hi>done,</hi> than ill Things <hi>said</hi> against them:
Such a peculiar rancour and venom doe
they leave behind them in men's Minds,
and so much more poysonously and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably
does the Serpent bite with his
<hi>Tongue,</hi> than with his <hi>Teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor are Men prevailed upon at this
odd, unaccountable rate, by bare Words,
only through a <hi>defect</hi> of Knowledge; but
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:107166:235"/>
sometimes also doe they suffer themselves
to be carried away with these <hi>Puffs of
Wind,</hi> even <hi>contrary</hi> to Knowledge and
Experience it self. For otherwise, how
could Men be brought to surrender up
their Reason, their Interest, and their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to Flattery? Gross, fulsome, abusive
Flattery; indeed more abusive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
upon a true estimate of Things
and Persons, than the rudest Scoffs, and
the sharpest Invectives. Yet so it is, that
though Men know themselves utterly
void of those Qualities and Perfections,
which the impudent Sycophant, at the
same time, both ascribes to them, and in
his Sleeve laughs at them for believing;
nay, though <hi>they know</hi> that the Flatterer
himself knows the falsehood of his own
Flatteries, yet they swallow the fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Morsel, love the Impostor, and with
both Arms hug the Abuse; And that to
such a degree, that no Offices of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
no real Services shall be able to
lie in the Balance against those luscious
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:107166:236"/>
Falsehoods, which Flattery shall feed the
Mind of a <hi>Fool in Power</hi> with; The
<hi>sweetness</hi> of the one infinitely over-comes
the <hi>substance</hi> of the other.</p>
            <p>And therefore, you shall seldom see,
that such an one cares to have Men of
Worth, Honesty, and Veracity about
him; For, such persons cannot fall down
and worship Stocks and Stones, though
they are placed never so high above
them. But their <hi>Yea</hi> is <hi>Yea,</hi> and their
<hi>Nay, Nay;</hi> and, they cannot admire a
<hi>Fox</hi> for his Sincerity, a <hi>Wolf</hi> for his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity,
nor an <hi>Ass</hi> for his Wit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity;
And therefore can never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to those whose whole Credit, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and Advantage lies in their not
appearing to the World, what they are
really in themselves. None are, or can
be welcome to such, but those who Speak
<hi>Paint</hi> and <hi>Wash;</hi> for that is the Thing
they <hi>love;</hi> and, no wonder, since it is
the Thing they <hi>need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is hardly any Rank, Order or
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:107166:236"/>
Degree of Men, but more or less have
been captivated, and enslaved by Words.
It is a Weakness, or rather a Fate, which
attends both high and low. The States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who holds the Helm, as well as the
Peasant who holds the Plough. So that
if ever you find an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> in Place
and Power, and can have so little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and so much Confidence, as to
tell him to his face, that he has a Wit
and an understanding above all the
World besides;<note place="margin">The Words of a great Self-opiniator, and a bitter Reviler of the Clergy.</note> and <hi>That
what his own Reason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
suggest to him, neither
can the United Reason of all
Mankind put together;</hi> I dare undertake,
that, as fulsome a Dose as you give him,
he shall readily take it down, and admit
the Commendation, though he cannot
believe the Thing: <hi>Blanditiae etiam cùm
excluduntur, placent;</hi> says <hi>Seneca.</hi> Tell
him, that no History, or Antiquity, can
match his Policies, and his Conduct;
and presently the Sot (because he knows
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:107166:237"/>
neither History, nor Antiquity) shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to <hi>measure himself by himself,</hi> (which
is the only sure way for him not to fall
short;) and so immediately amongst
his <hi>outward Admirers, and his inward Despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,</hi>
Vouched also by a <hi>Teste Me-ipso,</hi>
he steps forth an exact Politician; and,
by a wonderfull, and new way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
proves himself <hi>no fool,</hi> because, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
the Sycophant, who tells him so,
is an Egregious <hi>Knave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to give you yet a grosser Instance
of the force of Words, and of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Vanity of man's Nature in being
influenced by them, hardly shall you
meet with any person, Man or Woman,
so aged, or ill-favoured, but if you will
venture to commend them for their
Comeliness; nay, and for their Youth
too; though <hi>Time out of mind</hi> is wrote
upon every line of their face; yet they
shall take it very well at your hands, and
begin to think with themselves, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they have some Perfections, which
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:107166:237"/>
the generality of the World are not so
happy as to be aware of.</p>
            <p>But now, are not these (think we)
strange Self-delusions, and yet attested
by common Experience, almost every
day? But whence, in the mean time,
can all this proceed, but from that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotting
Intoxication, which this <hi>Verbal</hi>
Magick (as I may so call it) brings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Mind of Man? For, can any
thing in Nature have a more certain,
deep, and undeniable Effect, than Folly
has upon man's Mind, and Age upon
his Body? And yet we see, that in
both these, Words are able to perswade
men out of what they <hi>find</hi> and <hi>feel,</hi> to
reverse the very Impressions of Sense,
and to amuse men with Fancies and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes,
even in spight of Nature, and
Experience. But, since it would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to pursue all the Particulars in which
this Humour shews it self; whosoever
would have one full, lively and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
view of an empty, shallow, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opinion'd
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:107166:238"/>
Grandee, surrounded by his
Flatterers, (like a choice Dish of Meat by
a company of fellows <hi>commending,</hi> and
<hi>devouring</hi> it at the same time,) let him cast
his Eye upon <hi>Ahab</hi> in the midst of his
false Prophets, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. where we
have them all with one Voice for giving
him a cast of their Court-Prophecy, and
sending him, in a Complement, to be
knockt on the head at <hi>Ramoth Gilead.</hi>
But, says <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> (who smelt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasite</hi>
through the <hi>Prophet</hi>) in the 7th. <hi>vers.
Is there not a Prophet of the Lord besides,
that we may enquire of him? Why yes, says
Ahab, there is yet one man by whom we may
enquire of the Lord; but I hate him, for he
doth not prophecy Good concerning me, but
Evil.</hi> Ay! that was his crime; the poor
man was so <hi>good</hi> a <hi>Subject,</hi> and so <hi>bad
a Courtier,</hi> as to venture to serve, and
save his Prince, whether he would or no;
for, it seems, to give <hi>Ahab</hi> such warning,
as might infallibly have prevented his
Destruction, was esteemed by him <hi>Evil,</hi>
               <pb n="463" facs="tcp:107166:238"/>
and to push him on head-long into it,
because he was fond of it, was accounted
<hi>Good.</hi> These were his new measures of
<hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> And therefore, those who
knew how to <hi>make their Court</hi> better,
(as the Word is) tell him a bold Lye
in God's Name, and therewith send him
packing to his certain doom; thus call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Evil good</hi> at the cost of their Prince's
Grown, and his Life too. But what
cared they? they knew that it would
please; and that was enough for them;
there being always a sort of Men in the
World, (whom others have an Interest
to serve by,) who had rather a great deal
be <hi>pleased,</hi> than be <hi>safe. Strike</hi> them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>fifth Rib;</hi> provided at the same
time you <hi>kiss</hi> them too, as <hi>Ioab</hi> served
<hi>Abner,</hi> and you may both destroy and
oblige them with the same blow.</p>
            <p>Accordingly in the 30th. of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> we
find some arrived to that pitch of Sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishness,
and so much in love with their
own Ruin, as to own plainly and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:107166:239"/>
what they would be at; in the 10th.
verse; <hi>Prophesie not unto us, say they, right
things, but prophesie to us smooth things.</hi> As
if they had said, Doe but oil the Razor
for us, and let us alone to cut our own
Throats. Such an Enchantment is there
in Words; and so fine a thing does it
seem to some, to be ruined plausibly,
and to be ushered to their destruction
with Panegyrick and Acclamation; A
shamefull, though irrefragable Argument
of the absurd Empire, and Usurpation
of Words over Things; and, that the
greatest Affairs, and most important In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of the World, are carried on by
Things, not as they <hi>are,</hi> but as they are
<hi>called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the first Thing,
which I thought necessary to premise to
the Prosecution of our Third Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
            <p>2. The other Thing to be premised,
is this; That as the <hi>generality of Men</hi> are
wholly govern'd by Names, and Words;
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:107166:239"/>
so there is nothing, in which they are so
remarkably, and powerfully govern'd by
by them, as in matters of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi>
so far as these Qualities relate to, and affect
the Actions of men. A thing certainly of
a most fatal and pernicious import. For,
though in matters of <hi>meer</hi> Speculation,
it is not much the Concern of Society,
whether or no men proceed wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Trust,</hi> and take the bare Word of
others, for what they assent to; since it
is not much material to the Welfare ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Government, or of themselves,
whether they Opine right or wrong, and
whether they be Philosophers, or no. But
it is vastly the concern both of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of themselves too, whether
they be morally <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad, honest</hi> or
<hi>dishonest.</hi> And surely, it is hardly possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for men to make it their business
to be <hi>vertuous</hi> or <hi>honest,</hi> while Vices are
called and pointed out to them by the
<hi>Names</hi> of Vertues; and they all the
while, suppose the Nature of Things to
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:107166:240"/>
be truly and faithfully signified by their
Names, and thereupon <hi>believe</hi> as they
hear, and <hi>practise</hi> as they believe. And
that this is the course of much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of the World thus to take up their
Perswasions concerning <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> by
an <hi>Implicit Faith,</hi> and a full acquiescence
in the Word of those, who shall represent
things to them under these Characters, I
shall prove by Two Reasons; and those
such as (I fear) will not onely be found
Reasons to evince that men Actually do
so; but also sad Demonstrations to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that they are never like to doe
otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The First of which shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from that Similitude, Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and Affinity, which is between
<hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Vertue, Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
notable Instances of Each. For,
though the General Natures, and Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
of these Qualities are sufficiently
distant from one another, and so in no
danger of a promiscuous Confusion;
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:107166:240"/>
yet when they come to subsist in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
and to be cloathed, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with several Accidents, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
the Case is hereby much altered,
for then, the Discernment is neither so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
nor yet so certain. Thus it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
so obvious to distinguish between an
Act of Liberality, and an Act of Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
between an Act of Courage, and
an Act of Rashness; an Act of Pusilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,
and an Act of great Modesty
or Humility: Nay, and some have had
the good Luck to have their very <hi>Dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
dignified with the Name of <hi>Gravity,</hi>
and to be no small Gainers by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.
And many more such Actions of
Dubious Quality, might be instanced
in, too numerous to be here recounted,
or insisted on. In all which, and the
like, it requiring too great a Sagacity for
vulgar Minds to draw the Line nicely
and exactly between <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi>
and to adjust the due Limits of Each;
it is no Wonder, if most Men attempt
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:107166:241"/>
not a laborious Scrutiny into Things
themselves, but only take <hi>Names</hi> and
<hi>Words,</hi> as they first come, and so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more adoe rest in them; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so much easier, in all Disquisitions
of Truth, to suppose, than to prove,
and to believe, than to distinguish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other Reason of the
same shall be taken from the Great, and
Natural Inability of most Men to judge
exactly of Things; which makes it very
difficult for them to discern the real <hi>Good,</hi>
and <hi>Evil,</hi> of what comes before them,
to consider, and weigh Circumstances, to
scatter, and look through the Mists of
Errour, and so separate Appearances from
Realities. For the greater Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
is but slow and dull of Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and therefore in many Cases un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Necessity of Seeing with other Men's
Eyes, and judging with other Men's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings.
<hi>Nature</hi> having manifestly
contrived things so, that the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and
the <hi>Many,</hi> are fit only to be <hi>led,</hi> or <hi>dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
               <pb n="469" facs="tcp:107166:241"/>
but by no means fit to guide, or
direct themselves.</p>
            <p>To which their want of judging or
discerning Abilities, we may add also
their Want of Leisure, and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to apply their Minds to such a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and attent Consideration, as may
let them into a full Discovery of the true
<hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> of Things which are
Qualities, which seldom display them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the first View: For in most
things, <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> lie shuffled, and
thrust up together in a confused Heap;
and it is Study and Intention of
Thought which must draw them forth,
and range them under their distinct
Heads. But there can be no Study,
without Time; and the Mind must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
and dwell upon Things, or be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a Stranger to the <hi>Inside</hi> of them.
<hi>Through desire</hi> (says <hi>Solomon) a Man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
separated himself, seeketh and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medleth
with all Wisdom,</hi> Prov. 18. 12.
There must be Leisure and a Retirement,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:107166:242"/>
Solitude, and a Sequestration of a Man's
self from the Noise, and Toil of the
World: For Truth scorns to be seen by
Eyes too much fixt upon inferiour Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
It lies too deep to be fetcht up
with the <hi>Plough,</hi> and too close to be
beaten out with the <hi>Hammer.</hi> It dwells
not in Shops or Work houses; nor till
the late Age was it ever known, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one served Seven Years to a Smith,
or a Taylor, that he might at the End
thereof, proceed Master of <hi>any other Arts,</hi>
but such as those Trades taught him;
and much less that he should commence
Doctor, or Divine from the Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
or the Anvil; or from whistling
to a Team, come to preach to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
            <p>These were the peculiar, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Privileges of the late blessed Times
of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Inspiration:</hi> Otherwise Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will still hold on its old Course,
never doing any thing which is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
without the Assistance of its two
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:107166:242"/>
great Helps, <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>Industry.</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, the Knowledge of what is
<hi>Good,</hi> and what is <hi>Evil,</hi> what <hi>ought,</hi>
and what <hi>ought not</hi> to be done, in the
several Offices and Relations of Life, is
a thing too large to be compassed, and
too hard to be mastered, without Brains
and Study, Parts, and Contemplation;
which Providence never thought fit to
make much the greatest Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
Possessors of. And consequently
those who are not so, must, for the
Knowledge of most things, depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those who are; and receive their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
concerning <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi>
from such <hi>Verbal</hi> or <hi>Nominal</hi> Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Each, as shall be imparted to
them by those, whose Ability, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
they have Cause to rely upon,
for a faithfull Account of these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>And thus, from these two great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
premised. 1<hi>st.</hi> That the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of the World are wholly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:107166:243"/>
verned by <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Names;</hi> And 2<hi>dly.</hi>
That the Chief Instance in which they
are so, is in such <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Names,</hi> as
import the <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> of things; (<hi>Which</hi>
both the Difficulty of Things themselves,
and the very Condition of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
constrains much the greatest Part of
Mankind to take wholly upon Trust:)
I say, from these two Considerations,
must needs be inferr'd, <hi>What</hi> a fatal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish,
and destructive Effect the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application,
and Confusion of those great
Governing Names of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> must
inevitably have upon the Societies of Men.
The comprehensive Mischief of which,
will appear from this, that it takes in <hi>both</hi>
those ways, by which the greatest Evils,
and Calamities, which are incident to
Man, do directly break in upon him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> of which is by his <hi>being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi>
and the <hi>Second</hi> by his <hi>being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented.</hi>
And First, <hi>for the First of
these.</hi> I do not in the least doubt, but
if a true and just Computation could be
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:107166:243"/>
made of all the Miseries, and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
that befall Men in this World,
Two Thirds of them, at least, would be
found resolveable into their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by false Appearances of <hi>Good;</hi>
First deluding their Apprehensions, and
then by Natural Consequence perverting
their Actions; from which are the great
<hi>Issues of Life and Death;</hi> since according
to the Eternal Sanction of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
such as a Man's Actions are for <hi>Good</hi>
or <hi>Evil,</hi> such ought also his Condition
to be for <hi>Happiness,</hi> or <hi>Misery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all Deception in the Course of
Life is indeed nothing else, but a <hi>Lye</hi>
reduced to <hi>Practice,</hi> and Falshood, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from Words into Things.</p>
            <p>For is a Man impoverished, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
by the Purchase of an Estate? why;
it is, because he bought an Imposture:
pay'd down his Money for a Lye, and
by the help of the best and ablest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
(forsooth) that could be had, took a
<hi>Bad</hi> Title for a <hi>Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="474" facs="tcp:107166:244"/>
Is a Man unfortunate in Marriage?
still it is, because he was deceived; and
put his Neck into the <hi>Snare,</hi> before he
put it into the <hi>Yoke,</hi> and so took that for
Vertue, and Affection, which was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Vice in a Disguise, and a Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Humour under a Demure Look.</p>
            <p>Is he again unhappy, and calamitous
in his Friendships? Why; in this also, it is
because he built upon the Air, and trod
upon a Quick-sand, and took that for
Kindness, and Sincerity, which was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Malice, and Design, seeking an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to ruine him effectually, and
to overturn him in all his Interests by the
Sure, but fatal Handle of his own good
Nature, and Credulity.</p>
            <p>And lastly, is a Man betrayed, lost,
and blown by such Agents, and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as he imploys in his greatest and
nearest Concerns? Why, still the Cause
of it is from this, that he misplaced his
Confidence, took Hypocrisie for Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and so relied upon the Services of a
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:107166:244"/>
Pack of Villains, who designed nothing
but their own Game, and to <hi>stake</hi> him,
while they <hi>played</hi> for themselves.</p>
            <p>But not to mention any more Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
there is no Estate, Office, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Life whatsoever, but groans,
and labours under the Killing Truth of
what we have asserted.</p>
            <p>For it is this which supplants not onely
private Persons, but Kingdoms and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
by keeping them ignorant
of their own Strengths and Weaknesses;
and it is evident that Governments may
be equally destroyed by an Ignorance of
either. For the Weak by thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
strong, are induced to venture and
proclaim War against that which ruins
them; And the Strong, by conceiting
themselves weak, are thereby rendred as
unactive, and consequently as useless, as
if they really were so. <hi>In</hi> Luke 14. 31.
<hi>When a King with Ten Thousand is to meet
a King coming against him with Twenty
Thousand,</hi> our Saviour advises him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:107166:245"/>
he ventures the Issue of a Battel, <hi>to
sit down and consider.</hi> But now a false
glozing Parasite would give him quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Kind of Counsel, and bid him
onely reckon his <hi>Ten</hi> Thousand <hi>Fourty,</hi>
call his <hi>Fool-hardiness</hi> Valour, and then
he may go on <hi>boldly,</hi> because <hi>blindly,</hi> and
by mistaking himself for a <hi>Lyon,</hi> come
to perish like an <hi>Ass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, it is this great Plague of the
World <hi>Deception,</hi> which takes wrong
Measures, and makes false Musters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in every Thing; which sounds a
Retreat instead of a Charge, and a
Charge instead of a Retreat; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows
whole Armies; and sometimes
by one lying Word treacherously cast
out, turns the Fate and Fortune of States
and Empires, and lays the most flourishing
Monarchies in the Dust. A blind Guide
is certainly a great Mischief, but a Guide
that <hi>blinds</hi> those, whom he should <hi>lead,</hi>
is <hi>undoubtedly</hi> a much greater.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="477" facs="tcp:107166:245"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other great and undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mischief, which befalls Men upon
the fore-mentioned Account, is by their
being <hi>mis-represented.</hi> Now as by <hi>calling
Evil good,</hi> a Man is mis-represented to
himself in the Way of <hi>Flattery;</hi> so by
<hi>calling good Evil,</hi> he is mis-represented to
others in the Way of <hi>Slander,</hi> and Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I say Detraction, that killing,
poysoned <hi>Arrow</hi> drawn out of the Devil's
<hi>Quiver,</hi> which is always flying abroad,
and doing Execution in the <hi>Dark;</hi> against
which no Vertue is a Defence, no Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
a Security. For as by <hi>Flattery,</hi> a
Man is usually brought to open his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to his Mortal Enemy; so by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,</hi>
and a slanderous Mis-report of
Persons, he is often brought to shut the
same even to his best and truest Friends.
In both Cases he receives a fatal Blow,
since that which lays a Man open to an
Enemy, and that which strips him of a
Friend, equally attacks him in all those
Interests, that are capable of being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:107166:246"/>
by the one, and supported by the
other.</p>
            <p>The most direct and efficacious way
to ruine any Man, is to mis-represent
him; and it often so falls out, that it
wounds on both sides, and not onely
mauls the Person mis-represented, but
him also, to whom he is mis-represented:
For if he be Great, and Powerfull (as
<hi>Spies</hi> and <hi>Pick-thanks</hi> seldom apply to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others) it generally provokes him
through mistake to persecute, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
over; nay, and sometimes, even,
to dip his Hands in the Blood of the
Innocent, and the Just, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
himself in such a Guilt, as shall
Arm Heaven and Earth against him, the
Vengeance of God, and the Indignation
of Men; who will both espouse the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
of a bleeding Innocence, and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyn Forces against an insulting Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
especially when back'd with Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

Besides, that it is rarely found, that
Men hold their Greatness for Term of
Life; though their <hi>Baseness,</hi> for the most
part, they do; and then, according to
the common Vicissitude, and Wheel of
Things, the Proud, and the Insolent
must take their Turn too; and after
long trampling upon others, come, at
length, <hi>Plaudente, &amp; gaudente Mundo,</hi> to
be trampled upon themselves. For, as

            <p>But, to pass from Particulars to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,
nothing can be imagined more
destructive to Society than this villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Practice. For it robs the Publick
of all that Benefit, and Advantage, that
it may justly claim, and ought to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
from the Worth and Vertue of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Persons, by rendring their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
utterly insignificant. For <hi>Good</hi> it
self can do no good, while it passes for
<hi>Evil;</hi> and an honest Man is, in effect,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:107166:247"/>
useless, while he is accounted a <hi>Knave.</hi>
Both Things and Persons subsist by their
Reputation.</p>
            <p>An unjust Sentence from a Tribunal
may condemn an Innocent Person; but
Mis-representation condemns Innocence
it self. For it is this which revives, and
imitates that unhumane Barbarity of the
Old Heathen Persecutors, wrapping up
Christians in the Skins of wild Beasts,
that so they might be worried and torn
in pieces by Dogs. Do but paint an

               <q>And David said to Abigail; Blessed be the
Lord God of Israel, who sent thee this
Day to meet me.
And blessed be thy Advice, and blessed be
thou, who hast kept me this day from
coming to shed blood, and from avenging
my self with my own Hand.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THese Words are <hi>David</hi>'s Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or laying down of a bloody
and revengefull Resolution; which, for
a-while, his Heart had swelled with, and
carried him on with the highest Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport
of Rage to prosecute. A Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
took up from the Sense of a gross
Indignity, and Affront passed upon him,
in Recompence of a signal Favour and
Kindness received from him. For du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Exile, and Flight before <hi>Saul;</hi>
in which he was frequently put to all the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:107166:250"/>
Hardships, which usually befall the
Weak, flying before the Strong; there
happening a great, and solemn Festivity,
such as the <hi>Sheep-shearings</hi> used to be in
those Eastern Countries, he condescends,
by an Honourable, and Kind Message,
to beg of a Rich, and Great Man, some
small Repast, and Supply for himself,
and his poor harassed Companions, at
that Notable Time of Joy, and Feasting:
A Time that might make any thing, that
look'd like Want, or Hunger, no less an
Absurdity, than a Misery, to all that
were round about him. And, as if the
Greatness of the Asker, and the Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Thing asked, had not been
sufficient to inforce his Request, he <hi>adds</hi>
a Commemoration of his own Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and Noble Usage of the Person,
whom he thus addressed to; shewing
how that he had been a Wall, and a
Bulwark, to all that belong'd to him, a
Safeguard to his Estate, and a Keeper of
his Flocks; and that both from the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:107166:250"/>
of Robbers, and the License of his
own Souldiers; who could much more
easily have carved themselves their own
Provisions, than so great a Spirit stoop so
low as to ask them.</p>
            <p>But in answer to this, (as nothing is
so rude and insolent as a wealthy Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick)
all this his Kindness is overlooked,
his Request rejected, and his Person most
unworthily railed at. Such being the
Nature of some base Minds, that they
can never do ill Turns, but they must
double them with ill Words too. And
thus <hi>David</hi>'s Messengers are sent back to
him, like so many Sharks, and Runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates;
only for endeavouring to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
an ill Nature out of its self;
and seeking that by Petition, which
they might have commanded by their
Sword.</p>
            <p>And now, who would not but think,
that such ungratefull Usage, heightned
with such reproachfull Language, might
warrant the Justice of the sharpest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:107166:251"/>
even of such a Revenge, as now
began to boil, and burn in the Breast
of this great Warrior? For surely, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing may justly call up the utmost
of a Man's Rage, it should be bitter and
contumelious Words from an unprovo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Inferior; and, if any thing can lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
Revenge, it should be Injuries from
an extremely obliged Person. But for
all this, Revenge, we see, is so much
the Prerogative of the Almighty, so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
the Peculiar of Heaven, that no
Consideration whatsoever can empower,
even the best Men, to assume the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it in their own Case. And
therefore <hi>David,</hi> by an happy and season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Pacification, being took off from
acting that <hi>Bloody</hi> Tragedy, which he
was just now entring upon, and so tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his Eyes from the Baseness of him,
who had stirr'd up his Revenge, to the
Goodness of that God, who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it; he breaks forth into these
Triumphant Praises, and Doxologies,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:107166:251"/>
express'd in the Text: <hi>Blessed be the Lord
God of Israel, who has kept me this Day
from shedding Blood,</hi> and from <hi>avenging my
self with my own Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Words, together with those
going before in the same Verse, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afford us this Doctrinal Proposition,
which shall be the Subject of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Discourse. Namely, That <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Sin is one of the greatest Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
that God can vouchsafe a Man in this
World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prosecution of which shall lie in
these two Things: <hi>First,</hi> To <hi>prove</hi> the
Proposition; <hi>Secondly,</hi> To <hi>apply</hi> it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>First,</hi> for the Proof of it: The
transcendent Greatness of this <hi>Sin-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
Mercy,</hi> is demonstrable from these
Four following Considerations.</p>
            <p>1. Of the Condition which the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is in, when this Mercy is vouchsafed
him.</p>
            <p>2. Of the Principle or Fountain, from
whence this <hi>Prevention</hi> of Sin does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="490" facs="tcp:107166:252"/>
3. Of the Hazard a Man runs, if
the Commission of Sin be not <hi>prevented,</hi>
whether ever it will come to be <hi>pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi>
And,</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> Of the Advantages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing
to the Soul from the <hi>Prevention</hi> of
Sin, above what can be had from the
bare <hi>Pardon</hi> of it, in Case it comes to be
<hi>pardoned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of these in their Order: And <hi>First,</hi>
We are to take an Estimate of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Mercy, from the Condition
it finds the Sinner in, when God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to vouchsafe it to him. It finds him
in the direct way to Death and Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and, which is worse, wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to help himself. For he is actually
under the Power of a Temptation, and
the Sway of an impetuous Lust; both
hurrying him on to satisfie the Cravings
of it, by some wicked Action. He is
possessed, and acted by a Passion, which,
for the present, absolutely over-rules him;
and so can no more recover himself,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:107166:252"/>
than a Bowl rowling down an Hill, stop
its self in the midst of its Career. It is
a Maxim in the Philosophy of some,
<hi>That whatsoever is once in actual Motion,
will move for ever, if it be not hindred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So a Man, being under the Drift of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Passion, will still follow the Impulse
of it, till something interpose, and by a
stronger Impulse turn him another way:
But in this Case we can find no Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
within him strong enough to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-act
that Principle, and to relieve him.
For, if it be any, it must be either, <hi>First,</hi>
the Judgment of his Reason; or, <hi>Secondly,</hi>
the free Choice of his Will.</p>
            <p>But from the First of these there can
be no help for him in his present Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For, while a Man is engaged in
any sinfull Purpose, through the Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of any Passion, during the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of that Passion, he fully approves
of whatsoever he is carried on to doe in
the Strength of it; and judges it, under
his present Circumstances, the Best and
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:107166:253"/>
most Rational Course that he can take.
Thus we see, when <hi>Ionas</hi> was under the
Passion of Anger, and God asked him,
<hi>Whether he did well to be angry?</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>I do well to be angry even unto
Death,</hi> Jonas 4. 9. And when <hi>Saul</hi> was
under his persecuting Fit, what he did,
appeared to him good and necessary,
Acts 26. 9. <hi>I verily thought with my self,
that I ought to doe many things contrary to the
Name of Iesus.</hi> But to go no further than
the Text; Do we not think, that while
<hi>David</hi>'s Heart was full of his revengefull
Design, it had blinded, and perverted
his reason so far, that it struck in wholly
with his Passion, and told him, That the
Bloody purpose he was going to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
was Just, Magnanimous, and most
becoming such a Person, and so dealt
with, as he was? This being so, how is
it possible for a Man under a Passion, to
receive any Succour from his Judgment,
or Reason, which is made a Party in the
whole Action, and influenced to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:107166:253"/>
Approbation of all the ill Things
which his Passion can suggest? <hi>This is most
certain;</hi> and every Man may find it by
Experience, (if he will but impartially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the Method of his own Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and the Motions of his own Mind,)
That, while he is under any Passion, he
thinks and judges quite otherwise of the
proper Objects of that Passion, from what
he does, when he is out of it. Take a
Man under the Transports of a Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Rage or Revenge, and he passes a
very different Judgment upon Murder
and Blood-shed, from what he does when
his Revenge is over, and the Flame of
his Fury spent. Take a Man possessed
with a strong and immoderate Desire of
any thing, and you shall find, that the
Worth and Excellency of that thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
much greater, and more dazling
to the Eye of his Mind, than it does
when that Desire either by satisfaction,
or otherwise is quite extinguished. So
that while Passion is upon the Wing,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:107166:254"/>
and the Man fully engaged in the Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of some unlawfull Object, no
Remedy or Controll is to be expected
from his Reason, which is wholly gain'd
over to judge in favour of it. The
Fumes of his Passion do as really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate,
and confound his judging and
discerning Faculty, as the Fumes of Drink
discompose and stupify the Brain of
a Man over-charged with it. When
his Drink indeed is over, he sees the
Folly and the Absurdity, the Madness,
and the Vileness of those Things, which
before he acted with full Complacency,
and Approbation. Passion is the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness
of the Mind; and therefore, in
its present Workings not controllable by
Reason; forasmuch as the proper Effect
of it is, for the Time, to supersede the
Workings of Reason. <hi>This</hi> Principle
therefore being able to doe nothing to
the stopping of a Man, in the eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of his Sin; there remains no other,
that can be supposed able to doe any
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:107166:254"/>
thing upon the Soul, but that <hi>Second</hi>
mention'd, to wit, <hi>The Choice of his Will.</hi>
But this also is as much disabled from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
a Man fully intent upon the
Prosecution of any of his Lusts, as the
former. For all the Time, that a Man
is so, he absolutely wills, and is fully
pleased with what he is designing, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about. And whatsoever perfectly
pleases the Will, over-powers it; for it fixes
and determines the Inclination of it, to
that one Thing which is before it; and so
fills up all its Possibilities of Indifference,
that there is actually no room for Choice.
He who is under the Power of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
is pleased with his being so. He
who is angry, delights in nothing so
much as in the venting of his Rage. And
he who is lustfull, places his greatest Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in a Slavish following of the
Dictates of his Lust. And so long as
the Will, and the Affections are pleased,
and exceedingly gratified in any Course
of Acting, it is impossible for a Man
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:107166:255"/>
(so far as he is at his own disposal) not to
continue in it; or, by any Principle within
him, to be diverted or took off from it.</p>
            <p>From all which we see, that when a
Man has <hi>took up</hi> a full Purpose of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
he is hurried on to it in the Strength
of all those Principles, which Nature has
given him to act by: For Sin having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
his <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and got possession of
his <hi>Will,</hi> there is no other Principle left him
naturally, by which he can make head
against it. Nor is this all; but to these
Internal Dispositions to Sin, add the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Opportunities and Occasions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with them, and removing all
Letts, and Rubbs out of the Way, and (as
it were) making the <hi>Path</hi> of Destruction
<hi>plain before the Sinner's Face;</hi> so that he
may run his Course freely, and without
Interruption. Nay, when Opporunities
shall lie so fair, as not only to <hi>permit,</hi>
but even to <hi>invite,</hi> and further a Progress
in Sin. So that the Sinner shall set forth,
like a Ship launched into the wide Sea;
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:107166:255"/>
not only well built and rigg'd, but also
carried on with full <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Tide,</hi> to
the Port or place it is bound for: Surely
in this case, nothing under Heaven can be
imagined able to stop or countermand a
Sinner amidst all these Circumstances pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting,
and pushing on his sinfull Design.
For all that can give Force and Fury to
motion both from within, and from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
jointly meet to bear him forward in his
present Attempt. He presses on like an <hi>Horse
rushing into the Battle,</hi> and all that should
withstand him giving way before him.</p>
            <p>Now under this deplorable Necessity
of Ruine and Destruction does God's
<hi>preventing Grace</hi> find every Sinner, when
it <hi>snatches him like a Brand out of the Fire,</hi>
and steps in between the Purpose, and
the Commission of his Sin. It finds
him going on resolutely in the <hi>high</hi> and
<hi>broad-way</hi> to Perdition; which yet his
perverted Reason tells him, is right, and
his Will, <hi>Pleasant.</hi> And therefore he has
no Power of himself to leave, or turn
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:107166:256"/>
out of it; but he is ruined jocundly and
pleasantly, and damned according to
his Heart's desire. And, can there be a
more wretched and wofull Spectacle of
Misery, than a man in such a condition?
A man pleasing and destroying himself
together; A man (as it were) doing
Violence to Damnation, and taking Hell
by force. So that when the <hi>Preventing</hi>
Goodness of God reaches out its Arm,
and pulls him out of this fatal Path, it
does by main force even wrest him from
himself, and save him as it were against
his Will.</p>
            <p>But neither is this his total Inability
to recover or relieve himself the worst
of his condition; but, which is yet much
worse, it puts him into a state of actual
Hostility against, and Defiance of, that
Almighty God, from whom alone, in
this helpless, and forlorn condition, he
is capable of receiving help. For sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
while a man is going on in a full
purpose of Sin, he is trampling upon all
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:107166:256"/>
Law, spitting in the face of Heaven,
and provoking his Maker in the highest
manner; so that none is, or can be so
much concerned as God himself, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
and cut off such an one, and to
vindicate the honour of his great Name,
by striking him dead in his Rebellion.
And this brings us to the</p>
            <p>2<hi>d.</hi> Thing proposed; which was to
shew, What is the <hi>Fountain</hi> or <hi>Impulsive
Cause of this Prevention of Sin?</hi> It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<hi>Free Grace.</hi> A man at best, upon
all Principles of Divinity, and sound
Philosophy, is uncapable of <hi>meriting</hi>
any thing from God. But surely, while
he is under the Dominion of Sin, and
engaged in full Design and Purpose to
commit it, it is not imaginable what can
be found in him to oblige the Divine
Grace in his behalf. For, he is in high
and actual Rebellion against the only
Giver of such Grace. And therefore it
must needs flow from a redundant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Fulness of Compassion;
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:107166:257"/>
shewing Mercy, <hi>because it will shew
Mercy;</hi> from a Compassion, which is,
and must be its own Reason; and can
have no Argument for its Exercise, but
it self. No man in the strength of the
<hi>first Grace,</hi> can <hi>merit</hi> the <hi>second,</hi> (as some
fondly speak,) for Reason they doe not,
unless a Beggar, by receiving one Alms,
can be said to merit another. It is not
from what a man <hi>is,</hi> or what he has <hi>done;</hi>
from any <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Excellency,</hi> any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Worth or Desert in him, that God
is induced thus to interpose between Him
and Ruin, and so stop him in his full
career to Damnation. No, says God,
in <hi>Ezek. 16. 6. When I passed by, and saw
thee polluted in thine own Bloud, I said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, Live; yea, I said unto thee, when
thou wast in thy Bloud, Live.</hi> The Spirit
of God speaks this great Truth to the
Hearts of Men with Emphasis and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition,
knowing what an Aptness there
is in them to oppose it. God sees a
man wallowing in his native Filth and
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:107166:257"/>
Impurity, delivered over as an absolute
Captive to Sin, polluted with its Guilt,
and enslaved by its Power; and in this
most loathsome Condition fixes upon
him as an Object of his distinguishing
Mercy. And to shew yet further, that
the Actings of this Mercy, in the Work
of <hi>Prevention,</hi> are entirely free; Doe we
not sometimes see, in persons of equal
guilt and demerit, and of equal progress,
and advance in the ways of Sin; some
of them maturely diverted, and took off,
and others permitted to go on without
check or controll, till they finish a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Course in final Perdition? So true
is it, that, if things were cast upon this
Issue, that God should never prevent
Sin, till something in Man deserved it,
the best of Men would fall into Sin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in Sin, and Sin on for ever.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the <hi>Second</hi> Thing
proposed; which was to shew, <hi>What was
the Principle, or Fountain, from whence this
Prevention of Sin does proceed.</hi> Come
we now to the
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:107166:258"/>
3<hi>d.</hi> Demonstration, or Proof of the
Greatness of this <hi>preventing Mercy,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the <hi>Hazard a Man runs, if the
Commission of Sin be not prevented, whether
ever it will come to be pardoned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to the clearing of which, I
shall lay down these Two Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>1. That if Sin be not thus prevented,
it will certainly be committed; And the
Reason is, because, on the Sinner's part,
there will be always a strong inclination
to Sin. So that, if other things concurr,
and Providence cuts not off the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
the Act of Sin must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
For, an active Principle, second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Opportunities of Action, will
infallibly exert it self.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> The other Consideration is, That
in every Sin deliberately committed,
there are (generally speaking) many
more Degrees of Probability, that That
Sin will never come to be pardoned,
than that it will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="503" facs="tcp:107166:258"/>
And this shall be made appear upon
these <hi>Three</hi> following Accounts.</p>
            <p>1. Because every Commission of Sin
introduces into the Soul a certain degree
of Hardness, and an Aptness to continue
in that Sin. It is a known maxim; That
it is much more difficult to <hi>throw out,</hi>
than <hi>not to let in.</hi> Every degree of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
is a degree of Possession. Sin
taken into the Soul, is like a Liquor
poured into a Vessel; so much of it as
it fills, it also seasons. The Touch and
Tincture go together. So that although
the Body of the Liquor should be poured
out again, yet still it leaves that Tang
behind it, which makes the Vessel fitter
for that, than for any other. In like
manner, every Act of Sin strangely
transforms, and works over the Soul to
its own likeness. Sin in this being to
the Soul, like fire to combustible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
It assimilates, before it destroys
it.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> A second Reason is; Because
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:107166:259"/>
every Commission of Sin imprints upon
the Soul a further disposition, and prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to Sin. As the second, third, and
fourth Degrees of Heat are more easily
introduced, than the first. Every one is
both a preparative, and a step to the
next. Drinking both quenches the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Thirst, and provokes it for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
When the Soul is beaten from its
first Station, and the Mounds and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
of Vertue are once broken down,
it becomes quite another thing from
what it was before. In one single Eating
of the forbidden Fruit, when the Act is
over, yet the Relish remains; and the
Remembrance of the first Repast, is an
easie Allurement to the second. One
Visit is enough to begin an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and this Point is gained by it,
that when the Visitant comes again, he
is no more a Stranger.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> The third and grand Reason is;
Because the only thing, that can entitle
the Sinner to Pardon, which is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:107166:259"/>
is not in the Sinner's power. And
he who goes about the Work, will find
it so. It is the Gift of God: And though
God has certainly promised Forgiveness
of Sin to every one who Repents, yet
he has not promised to any one to give
him Grace to Repent. This is the Sinner's
hard Lot; that the same thing which
makes him need Repentance, makes
him also in danger of not obtaining it.
For, it provokes and offends that <hi>Holy
Spirit,</hi> which alone can bestow this Grace.
As the same Treason which puts a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
in need of his Prince's Mercy, is a
great and a just Provocation to his Prince
to deny it him.</p>
            <p>Now, let these Three things be put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
<hi>First,</hi> That every Commission
of Sin, in some degree, hardens the Soul
in that Sin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Sin disposes the Soul to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
further in Sin: And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That
to repent, and turn from Sin (without
which all Pardon is impossible) is not
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:107166:260"/>
in the Sinner's power; And then, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
there cannot but appear a greater
likelihood, that a Sin once committed,
will, in the issue, not be pardon'd, than
that it will. To all which, add the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of general Experience, and the
real Event of Things, That where one
Man ever comes to Repent, an hundred,
I might say a thousand at least, end their
days in final Impenitence.</p>
            <p>All which considered, surely there
cannot need a more pregnant Argument
of the Greatness of this <hi>Preventing Mercy;</hi>
if it did no more for a man than this;
That his grand, immortal Concern,
more valuable to him than ten thousand
Worlds, is not <hi>thrown</hi> upon a Critical
Point; that he is not <hi>bronght</hi> to his last
Stake; that he is rescued from the first
Descents into Hell, and the high Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
of Damnation.</p>
            <p>For, whatsoever the Issue proves, it is
certainly a miserable thing to be forced
to cast Lots for one's Life; yet in every
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:107166:260"/>
Sin a man does the same for Eternity.
And therefore, let the boldest Sinner take
this one Consideration along with him,
when he is going to Sin, That whether
the Sin he is about to act ever comes to
be pardoned or no; yet, as soon as it is
acted, it quite turns the Balance, puts
his Salvation upon the venture, leaves
him but one Cast for all; and, which is
yet much more dreadfull, makes it ten
to one odds against him.</p>
            <p>But, let us now alter the state of the
matter so, as to leave no doubt in the
case: But suppose, that the Sin, which
upon non-prevention comes to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
comes also to be repented of,
and consequently to be pardoned. Yet,
in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> place, The Greatness
of this <hi>Preventing-Mercy</hi> is eminently
proved from those Advantages accruing
to the Soul, from the <hi>Prevention</hi> of Sin,
above what can be had from the bare
<hi>Pardon</hi> of it. And that, in these Two
great Respects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="508" facs="tcp:107166:261"/>
1. Of the <hi>Clearness</hi> of a man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>2. Of the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of his Mind. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For the <hi>Clearness</hi> of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
If innocence be preferrible
to Repentance; and to be <hi>clean,</hi> be
more desirable, than to be <hi>cleansed;</hi> then
surely <hi>Prevention</hi> of Sin ought to have
the Precedence of its <hi>Pardon.</hi> For,
so much of Prevention, so much of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.
There are indeed various De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of it; and God in his Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
does not deal forth the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his <hi>Preventing Grace</hi> to All. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he may suffer the Soul but just to
begin the sinfull production, in reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon a Sin suggested by the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
with some Complacency, and
Delight; which, in the Apostle's phrase,
is <hi>to conceive Sin;</hi> and then, in these early,
imperfect Beginnings, God perhaps may
presently dash, and extinguish it. Or,
possibly he may permit the Sinfull <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to receive Life and Form, by pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:107166:261"/>
into a purpose of committing it;
and then he may make it prove Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
by stifling it, before ever it comes
to the Birth. Or, perhaps, God may
think fit, to let it come <hi>even to the Birth</hi>
by some strong Endeavours to commit
it; and yet then, deny it <hi>strength to bring
forth;</hi> so that it never comes into Actual
Commission. Or, lastly, God may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to be Born, and see the World,
by permitting the Endeavour of Sin to
pass into the Commission of it. And
this is the last fatal step, but one; which
is by frequent Repetition of the sinfull
Act, to continue and persist in it, till at
length it settles into a fixed, confirmed
Habit of Sin; which being properly
that, which the Apostle calls the <hi>finishing
of Sin,</hi> ends certainly in <hi>Death;</hi> Death,
not only as to Merit, but also as to
Actual Infliction.</p>
            <p>Now peradventure in this whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
<hi>Preventing, Grace</hi> may sometimes
come in to the poor Sinner's help, but <hi>at
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:107166:262"/>
the last hour of the Day;</hi> and having suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him to run all the former risk and
maze of Sin, and to descend so many
steps downwards to the black Regions
of Death: As first, from the bare
Thought and Imagination of Sin, to
look upon it with some Beginnings of
Appetite, and Delight; from thence to
purpose and intend it; and from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
to endeavour it; and from
endeavouring, actually to commit it;
and having committed it, perhaps for
some time to continue in it. And then
(I say) after all this, God may turn the
fatal Stream, and by a mighty Grace
interrupt its Course, and keep it from
passing into a settled Habit, and so hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the absolute Completion of Sin in
final Obduracy.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that wheresoever it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
God to stop the Sinner on this side
Hell, how far soever he has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in his way towards it, it is a vast,
ineffable Mercy; a Mercy as great as
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:107166:262"/>
Life from the Dead, and Salvation to a
man tottering with Horror upon the
very Edge and Brink of Destruction.
But if, more than all this, God shall be
pleased by an Early Grace to prevent Sin
so soon, as to keep the Soul in the Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of its first Innocence, not tainted with
the Desires, and much less defloured
with the formed Purpose of any thing
vile and sinfull; What an Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is this? It is not a <hi>Converting,</hi> but
a <hi>Crowning</hi> Grace; such an one as irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates,
and puts a Circle of Glory about
the Head of him, upon whom it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends;
It is the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> coming down
upon him <hi>in the form of a Dove;</hi> and
setting him Triumphant above the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Tears and Sorrow, Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Repentance, the sad After-games
of a lost Innocence. And this brings
in the Consideration of that other great
Advantage accruing to the Soul from
the <hi>Prevention of Sin,</hi> above what can
be had from the bare Pardon of it;
Namely,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="512" facs="tcp:107166:263"/>
2. <hi>The Satisfaction of a man's Mind.</hi>
There is that true Joy, that solid and
substantial Comfort, conveyed to the
Heart by <hi>Preventing-Grace;</hi> which <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning-Grace,</hi>
at the best, very seldom,
and, for the most part, never gives. For,
since all Joy passes into the Heart through
the Understanding, the Object of it must
be known by one, before it can affect
the other. Now, when Grace keeps a
Man so within his Bounds, that Sin is
<hi>prevented,</hi> he certainly knows it to be
so; and so rejoyces upon the firm, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Ground of Sense and Assurance.
But, on the other side, though Grace
may have reversed the Condemning Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and sealed the Sinner's Pardon
before God, yet it may have left no
Transcript of that Pardon in the Sinner's
Breast. The <hi>Hand-writing</hi> against him
may be Cancelled in the <hi>Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
and yet the Enditement run on in
the <hi>Court of Conscience.</hi> So that a Man
may be <hi>safe</hi> as to his Condition, but in
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:107166:263"/>
the mean time <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>doubtfull</hi> as to
his Apprehensions; <hi>Secure</hi> in his Pardon,
but <hi>miserable</hi> in the Ignorance of it; and
so passing all his days in the disconsolate,
uneasie Vicissitudes of Hopes and Fears,
at length go out of the World, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whither he goes. And, what is this
but a black Cloud drawn over all a
man's Comforts? A Cloud, which
though it cannot hinder the supporting
<hi>Influence</hi> of Heaven, yet will be sure
to intercept the refreshing <hi>Light</hi> of it.
The <hi>Pardoned Person</hi> must not think to
stand upon the same vantage Ground
with the <hi>Innocent.</hi> It is enough that they
are both equally <hi>safe;</hi> but it cannot be
thought, that without a rare Privilege,
both can be equally <hi>chearfull.</hi> And,
thus much for the advantagious Effects
of <hi>Preventing,</hi> above those of <hi>Pardoning</hi>
Grace; which was the Fourth and Last
Argument brought for the Proof of the
Proposition. Pass we now to the next
General Thing proposed for the Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it; Namely,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:107166:264"/>
2. Its <hi>Application.</hi> Which, from the
foregoing Discourse, may afford us se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
usefull Deductions; but chiefly by
way of <hi>Information,</hi> in these Three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Particulars. As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> This may inform and convince
us how vastly greater a pleasure is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
upon the <hi>Forbearance</hi> of Sin,
than can possibly accompany the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
of it; And, how much higher
a Satisfaction is to be found from a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,</hi>
than from a <hi>conquering</hi> Passion.
For the proof of which, we need look
no further than the great Example here
before us. Revenge is certainly the most
luscious Morsel that the Devil can put
into the Sinner's mouth. But, doe we
think, that <hi>David</hi> could have found half
that pleasure in the Execution of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
that he expresses here upon the
Disappointment of it? Possibly it might
have pleased him in the present heat and
hurry of his Rage, but must have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
him infinitely more in the cool,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:107166:264"/>
sedate Reflections of his Mind. For, Sin
can please no longer, than for that piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Space of Time while it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
and surely the present pleasure of
a sinfull Act, is a poor Countervail for
the bitterness of the Review, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
where the Action ends, and lasts for
ever. There is no ill thing which a man
does in his Passion, but his Memory will
be revenged on him for it afterwards.</p>
            <p>All Pleasure springing from a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Passion, as most of the Pleasure of
Sin does, must needs determine with
that Passion. 'Tis short, violent, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious;
and, as soon as the Imagination
is disabused, will certainly be at an end.
And therefore <hi>Des Cartes</hi> prescribes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
well for the Regulation of the
Passions; <hi>viz.</hi> That a Man should fix
and fore-arm his Mind with this settled
Perswasion, that, during that Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Blood and Spirits, in which
Passion properly consists, whatsoever is
offered to his Imagination in favour of
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:107166:265"/>
it, tends only to deceive his Reason. It
is indeed a real Trapan upon it; feeding
it with Colours, and Appearances, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Arguments; and driving the
very same Bargain, which <hi>Iacob</hi> did with
<hi>Esau, A Mess of Pottage</hi> for a <hi>Birth-right,</hi>
a present Repast for a Perpetuity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have here a sure unfail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Criterion,</hi> by which every Man may
discover, and find out the gracious or
ungracious Disposition of his own
Heart. The Temper of every Man is
to be judged of from the Thing he most
esteems; and the Object of his <hi>Esteem,</hi>
may be measured by the prime Object
of his <hi>Thanks.</hi> What is it, that opens
thy Mouth in Praises, that fills thy Heart,
and lifts up thy Hands in gratefull Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
to thy great Creator,
and Preserver? Is it, that thy Bags, and
thy Barns are full, that thou hast escaped
this Sickness, or that Danger? Alas,
God may have done all this for thee in
Anger! All this fair Sun-shine may have
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:107166:265"/>
been only to harden thee in thy Sins.
He may have given thee Riches and
Honour, Health and Power with a
Curse; and, if so, it will be found but
a poor Comfort, to have had never so
great a share of God's <hi>Bounty,</hi> without
his <hi>Blessing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, has he at any time kept thee
from thy Sin? stopt thee in the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of thy Lust? defeated the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Arts and Stratagems of thy mortal
Enemy the Tempter? And, does not the
sense of this move and affect thy Heart
more than all the former Instances of
Temporal Prosperity, which are but
(as it were) the promiscuous Scatterings
of his Common Providence, while these
are the distinguishing Kindnesses of his
special Grace?</p>
            <p>A truly pious Mind has certainly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
kind of relish and taste of these
things; and, if it receives a Temporal
Blessing with Gratitude, it receives a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
one with Ecstasie and Transport.
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:107166:266"/>
               <hi>David,</hi> an heroick Instance of such a
Temper, over-looks the rich and season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Present of <hi>Abigail,</hi> though pressed
with Hunger and Travel; but her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which disarmed his Rage, and
calmed his Revenge, draws forth those
high and affectionate Gratulations from
him: <hi>Blessed be thy advice, and blessed be
thou, who hast kept me this day from shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Bloud, and avenging my self with my
own hand.</hi> These were his joyfull and
glorious Trophies; not that he Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
over his Enemy, but that he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
over his Revenge; that he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
from himself, and was delivered
from his own Fury. And whosoever has
any thing of <hi>David</hi>'s Piety, will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
playing the Throne of Grace
with such-like Acknowledgment; As,
<q>
                  <hi>Blessed</hi> be that Providence, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
me from such a lewd Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and such a vicious Acquaintance,
which was the Bane of such, and such
a person. And, <hi>Blessed be that God</hi>
                  <pb n="519" facs="tcp:107166:266"/>
who cast rubs, and stops, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
in my way, when I was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
the Commission of such or
such a Sin; who took me out of such
a Course of Life, such a Place, or
such an Imployment, which was a
continual Snare and Temptation to
me. And, <hi>Blessed be such a Preacher,</hi>
and such a Friend, whom God made
use of to speak a Word in season to
my wicked Heart, and so turned me
out of the Paths of Death and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and saved me in spight of
the World, the Devil, and my Self.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These are such things as a Man shall
remember with Joy upon his Death-bed;
such as shall chear and warm his Heart
even in that last and bitter Agony, when
many from the very bottom of their
Souls shall wish, that they had never
been Rich, or Great, or Powerfull; and
reflect with Anguish and Remorse upon
those splendid Occasions of Sin, which
served them for little, but to heighten
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:107166:267"/>
their Guilt, and at best to inflame their
Accounts, at that great Tribunal which
they are going to appear before.</p>
            <p>3. In the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> place. We
learn from hence, the great Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of, not only a <hi>contented,</hi> but also
a <hi>thankfull</hi> Acquiescence in any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and under the crossest and severest
passages of Providence, which can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
befall us: Since there is none of
all these but may be the Instruments of
<hi>Preventing-Grace</hi> in the hands of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
God, to keep us from those Courses
which would otherwise assuredly end in
our confusion. This is most certain,
that there is no Enjoyment which the
Nature of Man is either desirous or
capable of, but may be to him a direct
inducement to Sin, and consequently is
big with Mischief, and carries Death in
the Bowels of it. But to make the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
more particular, and thereby
more convincing, let us take an Account
of it with reference to the three greatest
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:107166:267"/>
and deservedly most valued Enjoyments
of this Life.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Health,</hi> 2ly. <hi>Reputation;</hi> And, 3ly.
<hi>Wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> And first for <hi>Health.</hi> Has God
made a Breach upon that? Perhaps he
is building up thy Soul upon the Ruins
of thy Body. Has he bereaved thee of
the use and vigour of thy Limbs? Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
he saw that otherwise they would
have been the Instruments of thy Lusts,
and the active Ministers of thy Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries.
Perhaps thy languishing upon
thy Bed has kept thee from rotting in
a Gaol, or in a worse place. God saw
it necessary by such Mortifications to
quench the Boilings of a furious, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
Appetite, and the boundless
Rage of an insatiable Intemperance; to
make the Weakness of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
and Restaurative of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> And,
in a word, rather to save thee, diseased,
sickly, and deformed, than to let Strength,
Health and Beauty, drive thee head-long
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:107166:268"/>
(as they have done many thousands)
into Eternal Destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Has God in his Providence
thought fit to drop a Blot upon thy
Name, and to Blast thy Reputation?
He saw perhaps that the Breath of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Air was grown Infectious, and would
have derived a Contagion upon thy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part. Pride and Vain-glory had
mounted thee too high, and therefore
it was necessary for Mercy to take thee
down, to prevent a greater fall. <hi>A good
Name is,</hi> indeed, <hi>better than Life;</hi> but a
sound Mind is better than both. Praise
and Applause had swell'd thee to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
ready to burst; it had vitiated
all thy spiritual Appetites, and brought
thee to feed upon the Air, and to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
upon the Wind, and, in a word, to
starve thy Soul, only to pamper thy Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
            <p>And now, if God makes use of some
poynant Disgrace to prick this enormous
Bladder, and to let out the poysonous
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:107166:268"/>
Vapour, is not the Mercy greater than
the Severity of the Cure? <hi>Cover them
with shame</hi> (says the <hi>Psalmist</hi>) that they
<hi>may seek thy Name.</hi> Fame and Glory
transports a Man out of himself; and,
like a violent Wind, though it may bear
him up for a while, yet it will be sure
to let him fall at last. It makes the
Mind loose, and garish, scatters the
Spirits, and leaves a kind of Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon all the Faculties. Whereas
<hi>shame</hi> on the contrary (as all Grief does)
naturally contracts and unites, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
fortifies the Spirits, fixes the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings
of Fancy, and so reduces and
gathers the Man into himself. This is
the soveraign Effect of a bitter Potion,
administred by a Wise and Mercifull
Hand: And what hurt can there be in
all the Slanders, Obloquies and Disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this World, if they are but the
Arts and Methods of Providence to
shame us into the <hi>Glories</hi> of the next.
But then,

               <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> Has God thought
fit to cast thy Lot amongst the Poor of
this World, and that either by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee any share of the Plenties of this
Life, (which is something grievous;) or
by taking them away, which is much
more so? Yet still all this may be but
the Effect of <hi>Preventing</hi> Mercy. For so
much mischief as Riches have done, and
may doe to the Souls of Men, so much
Mercy may there be in taking them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
For, does not the Wisest of Men,
next our Saviour, tell us of <hi>Riches kept
to the hurt of the owners</hi> of them? <hi>Eccles.</hi>
5. 13. And, does not our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
speak of the intolerable Difficulty,
which they cause in men's passage to
Heaven? Doe they not make the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
way</hi> much narrower? and contract
<hi>the Gate which leads to life</hi> to the streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a <hi>Needle's Eye?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, if God will fit thee for
this passage, by taking off thy Load,
and emptying thy Bags, and so sute
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:107166:269"/>
the Narrowness of thy Fortune, to the
<hi>Narrowness of the way</hi> thou art to pass,
is there any thing but Mercy in all this?
Nay, are not the <hi>Riches</hi> of his Mercy
conspicuous in the <hi>Poverty</hi> of thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</p>
            <p>Thou who repinest at the Plenty and
Splendour of thy Neighbour, at the
Greatness of his Incomes, and the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of his Retinue; Consider what
are frequently the dismal, wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of all this, and thou wilt have
little cause to Envy this gaudy Great
One, or to wish thy self in his room.</p>
            <p>For, doe we not often hear of this
or that young Heir newly come to his
Father's vast Estate? An happy Man,
no doubt! But, does not the Town pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
ring of his Debaucheries, his Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
and his Murders? Are not his
Riches and his Lewdnesses talkt of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
and the Odiousness of one,
heightned and set off by the Greatness
of the other? Are not his Oaths, his
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:107166:270"/>
Riots, and other Villainies, reckoned by
as <hi>many thousands</hi> as his Estate?</p>
            <p>Now consider, had this grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchee,
this glistering Monster, been
born to thy Poverty and mean Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
he could not have contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such a clamorous Guilt, he could
not have been so bad: Nor, perhaps,
had thy Birth enstated thee in the same
Wealth and Greatness, would'st thou
have been at all better.</p>
            <p>This God fore-saw, and knew, in the
ordering both of his and thy Condition:
And which of the Two now, can we
think, is the greater Debtor to his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting</hi>
Mercy? Lordly Sins require
Lordly Estates to support them: And
where Providence denies the latter, it
cuts off all Temptation to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shown by particular
Instances, what Cause men have to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in, and submit to the harshest
Dispensations that Providence can mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:107166:270"/>
out to them in this life; and with
what Satisfaction, or rather Gratitude,
that ought to be <hi>endured,</hi> by which the
greatest of Mischiefs is <hi>prevented.</hi> The
great Physician of Souls, sometimes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Cure without Cutting us. Sin has
festred inwardly, and he must launce
the Impostume, to let out Death with the
Suppuration. He who ties a Mad-man's
Hands, or takes away his Sword, loves
his Person, while he disarms his Frenzy.
And whether by Health or Sickness, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or Disgrace, Wealth or Poverty,
Life or Death, Mercy is still contriving,
acting, and carrying on the Spiritual
Good of all those who <hi>love God,</hi> and are
<hi>loved by Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whom therefore be rendred and ascribed,
as is most due, all Praise, Might, Majesty
and Dominion, both now and for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
<hi>Amen.</hi>

<hi>Nature and Measures

IN
Two SERMONS
On 1 <hi>IOHN</hi> III. 21.
PREACHED
Before the UNIVERSITY at
<hi>Christ-Church,</hi> Oxon.
The <hi>First</hi> Preached on the 1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1691.</head>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 JOHN III. 21.</bibl>
               <q>Beloved, if our Heart condemn us not, we
have Confidence towards God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AS nothing can be of more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
so few things, <hi>doubtless,</hi> are
of more difficulty, than for Men
to be rationally satisfied about the estate
of their Souls, with reference to God,
and the great Concerns of Eternity. In
their Judgment about which, if they err
finally, it is like a man's missing his
Cast when he throws <hi>Dice</hi> for <hi>his Life;</hi>
His Being, his Happiness, and all that
he does, or can enjoy in the World, is
involved in the Error of one Throw.
And therefore it may very well deserve
our best Skill and Care, to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those Rules, by which we may guide
our <hi>Iudgment</hi> in so weighty an Affair,
both with safety and success. And this,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:107166:273"/>
I think, cannot be better done, than by
separating the <hi>false</hi> and <hi>fallacious,</hi> from
the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>certain.</hi> For, if the <hi>Rule</hi>
we judge by, be <hi>uncertain,</hi> it is odds,
but we shall judge wrong; and, if we
should judge right; yet it is not
properly <hi>Skill,</hi> but <hi>Chance;</hi> not a true
Judgment, but a lucky Hit: Which
certainly, the Eternal Interests of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Soul, are of much too high a
Value to be left at the Mercy of.</p>
            <p>First of all then: He who would pass
such a Judgment <hi>upon his Condition,</hi> as
shall be ratified in Heaven, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
at that great Tribunal, from
which there lies no Appeal, will find
himself wofully deceived, if he judges
of his <hi>spiritual estate</hi> by any of these Four
following Measures: As,</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>general esteem of the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him.</hi> He, who owes his <hi>Piety</hi> to
Fame and Hear-say, <hi>and the Evidences of
his Salvation</hi> to popular Voice and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
builds his House not only <hi>upon the
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:107166:273"/>
Sand,</hi> but (which is worse) upon the
<hi>Wind;</hi> and writes the <hi>Deeds,</hi> by which
he holds his Estate, upon the face of a
<hi>River.</hi> He makes a Bodily <hi>Eye</hi> the Judge
of Things impossible to be <hi>seen;</hi> and
Humor and Ignorance (which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Men both think and speak
by) the <hi>great Proofs</hi> of his Justification.
But, surely, no man has the <hi>Estate of his
Soul</hi> drawn upon <hi>his Face,</hi> nor the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of his <hi>Election</hi> wrote upon <hi>his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>
He who would know a man
throughly, must follow him into the
Closet of his Heart; the Door of which
is kept shut to all the World besides,
and the Inspection of which is only the
Prerogative of Omniscience.</p>
            <p>The favourable opinion, and good
word of Men (to <hi>some persons</hi> especially)
comes oftentimes at a very easie rate;
and, by a few demure <hi>Looks,</hi> and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Whines,</hi> set off with some odd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional
Postures and Grimaces, and
such other little Arts of Dissimulation,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:107166:274"/>
cunning Men will doe Wonders, and
Commence presently Heroes for Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Self-denial, and Sincerity, while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
perhaps they are as <hi>Proud as Lucifer,
as Covetous as Demas, as false as Iudas;</hi>
and, in the whole Course of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
<hi>Act,</hi> and <hi>are Acted</hi> not by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
but Design.</p>
            <p>So that, for ought I see, though the
<hi>Mosaical</hi> part of <hi>Iudaism</hi> be abolished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Christians, the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> part
of it never will. A grave, stanch, skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<hi>managed Face,</hi> set upon a grasping,
aspiring Mind, having got many a sly
Formalist the Reputation of a <hi>Primitive
and severe Piety</hi> (forsooth) and made
many such Mountebanks pass admired,
even for <hi>Saints upon Earth</hi> (as the word
is) who are like to be so no-where
else.</p>
            <p>But a man, who had never seen the
stately outside of a <hi>Tomb,</hi> or <hi>painted Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre</hi>
before, may very well be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
if he takes it rather for the <hi>Reposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:107166:274"/>
of some rich Treasure,</hi> than of a <hi>noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Corps;</hi> but should he but once open
and rake into it, though he could not
<hi>see,</hi> he would quickly <hi>smell out,</hi> his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.
The greatest part of the World
is nothing but <hi>Apperance,</hi> nothing but
<hi>Shew</hi> and <hi>Surface;</hi> and many make it
their Business, their Study and Concern,
that it should be so; who having for
many years together deceived all about
them, are at last willing to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
too; and, by a long, immemorial
Practice, and (as it were) <hi>Prescription</hi>
of an aged, thorough-paced <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi>
come at length to believe that for a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,</hi>
which, at the first Practice of it,
they themselves knew to be a Cheat.
But, if Men love to be deceived, and
fooled about so great an Interest as that
of their <hi>spiritual Estate,</hi> it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that they cannot take a surer, and
more effectual Course to be so, than by
taking their Neighbour's Word for that,
which can be known to them only from
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:107166:275"/>
their <hi>own Hearts.</hi> For, certainly, it is
not more absurd to undertake to tell the
<hi>Name</hi> of an <hi>unknown person by his looks,</hi>
than to Vouch a man's <hi>Saintship</hi> from
the <hi>vogue</hi> of the World, founded upon
his <hi>External Behaviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> The Judgement of any <hi>Casuist</hi> or
<hi>Learned Divine,</hi> concerning the <hi>Estate of
a man's Soul,</hi> is not sufficient to give him
Confidence towards God. And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because no Learning whatsoever
can give a man the Knowledge of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<hi>Heart.</hi> Besides, that it is more
than possible that the most profound,
and experienced <hi>Casuist</hi> in the World,
may mistake in his Judgment of a man's
spiritual Condition; and, if he does
judge right, yet the Man cannot be sure
that he will declare that Judgment sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
and impartially, (the <hi>greatest Clerks</hi>
being not always the <hi>honestest,</hi> any more
than the <hi>wisest Men,</hi>) but may purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sooth a man up for Hope or Fear, or
the Service of some sinister Interest;
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:107166:275"/>
and so shew him the face of a foul
Soul in a flattering Glass: Considering
how much the raising in some Men a
false Hope of <hi>another</hi> World, may,
with others, serve a real Interest in
<hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Generation of Men, who
have framed their Casuistical Divinity
to a perfect Compliance with all the
corrupt Affections of Man's Nature;
and by that new-invented Engine of the
<hi>Doctrine of Probability,</hi> will undertake to
warrant, and quiet the Sinner's Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the Commission of any Sin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
provided there be but the <hi>Opinion
of one Learned Man</hi> to vouch it. For this,
they say, is a sufficient Ground for the
Conscience of any unlearned Person to
rely, and to act upon. So that if but
<hi>one Doctor</hi> asserts, that I may lawfully
kill a Man, to prevent a Box on the
Ear, or a Calumny, by which he would
otherwise asperse my good Name, I
may, with a good Conscience, doe it;
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:107166:276"/>
Nay, I may safely rest upon this one
Casuist's Judgment, though thousands,
as learned as himself; yea, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<hi>Law of God</hi> besides, affirm the quite
contrary. But these Spiritual Engineers
know well enough, how to deal with
any Commandment, either by Taking,
or Expounding it, <hi>away,</hi> at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>Such an Ascendant have these Romish
Casuists over <hi>Scripture, Reason,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality;</hi>
much like what is said of the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
modern <hi>Iews,</hi> that they have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
their <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> to such a
sottish Servitude to their <hi>Rabbies,</hi> as to
hold, That in case two <hi>Rabbies</hi> should
happen to contradict one another, they
were yet bound to believe the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
Assertions of both to be equally
certain, and equally the Word of God:
Such an Iron-digesting Faith have they,
and such pity it is, that there should be
no such thing in <hi>Iudaism</hi> as <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi>
to imploy it upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="539" facs="tcp:107166:276"/>
But, as for these Casuists, whom I have
been speaking of; if the Judgment of
<hi>one Doctor</hi> may authorize the Practice of
any Action, I believe, it will <hi>be hard to
find</hi> any sort or degree of Villainy, which
the Corruption of Man's Nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of committing, which shall not
meet with a <hi>Defence.</hi> And of this, I
could give you such an Instance from
something wrote by a certain Prelate
of theirs, Cardinal and Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Beneventum,</hi> as were enough, not only
to astonish all Pious Ears, but almost to
unconsecrate the very Church I speak
in.</p>
            <p>But the Truth is, the Way, by which
these <hi>Romish Casuists</hi> speak <hi>Peace</hi> to the
Consciences of Men, is either by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, that many Actions, <hi>are not
Sins,</hi> which yet really are so; or, by
suggesting something to them, which
shall satisfie their Minds, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a known, actual, avowed Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in their Sins: Such as are their
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:107166:277"/>
               <hi>Pardons</hi> and <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and giving Men
a share in the <hi>Saints Merits,</hi> out of the
Common Bank and Treasury of the
Church, which the <hi>Pope</hi> has the sole
custody and disposal of, and is never
kept <hi>shut</hi> to such as come with an <hi>open
hand.</hi> So that, according to these <hi>New
Evangelists,</hi> well may we pronounce,
<hi>Blessed are the Rich, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven.</hi> But God deliver the
World from such <hi>Guides,</hi> or rather such
<hi>Hucksters</hi> of Souls, the very shame of
Religion, and the shameless Subverters
of Morality. And, it is really matter
both of Wonder and Indignation, that
such <hi>Impostors</hi> should at all concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
about Rules or Directions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
who seem to have no Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to apply them to.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> The <hi>Absolution</hi> pronounced by a
Priest, whether <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Protestant,</hi> is
not a certain, infallible Ground, to give
the person, so absolved, confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God: And the Reason is, Because,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:107166:277"/>
if <hi>Absolution,</hi> as such, could of it self se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a Man, as to the Estate of his Soul,
then it would follow, That every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
so absolved, should, by vertue
thereof, be, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> put into such a
Condition of safety, which is not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
            <p>For the Absolution pronounced must
be either <hi>Conditional,</hi> as running upon
the Conditions of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance;</hi>
and <hi>then,</hi> if those Conditions are not
sound in the person so absolved, it is
but a Seal to a Blank, and so a meer
Nullity to him. Or, the <hi>Absolution</hi> must
be pronounced in Terms <hi>absolute,</hi> and
<hi>unconditional:</hi> And if so, then the said
<hi>Absolution</hi> becomes valid and effectual,
either by vertue of the <hi>State</hi> of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to whom it was pronounced, as
being a <hi>true Penitent,</hi> or by vertue of
the <hi>Opus Operatum,</hi> or bare Action it
self of the Priest Absolving him. If
it receives its <hi>Validity</hi> from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
then it is clear, That although it
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:107166:278"/>
runs in Forms <hi>Absolute,</hi> yet it is indeed
<hi>Conditional,</hi> as depending upon the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification</hi>
of the Person, to whom it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced;
Who therefore owes the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his Sins, not properly to the
<hi>Priest's Absolution,</hi> but to his own <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
which made that Absolution
effectual, and would undoubtedly have
saved him, though the Priest had never
Absolved him.</p>
            <p>But if it be <hi>asserted</hi> that the <hi>very Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the <hi>Priest absolving him</hi> has of it
self this Vertue; then we must grant
also, that it is in the Priest's power to
save a Man, who never repented, nor
did one good <hi>Work</hi> in all his life; for-as-much
as it is in his Power to perform
this <hi>Action</hi> upon him in full Form, and
with full Intention to <hi>Absolve him.</hi> But
the horrible Absurdity, Blasphemy, and
Impiety of this Assertion, sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
its Falsity without any further
Confutation.</p>
            <p>In a word, if a man be a <hi>Penitent,</hi>
               <pb n="543" facs="tcp:107166:278"/>
his <hi>Repentance</hi> stamps his <hi>Absolution</hi> effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.
If not, let the Priest repeat the
same <hi>Absolution</hi> to him Ten thousand
times; yet for all his being <hi>absolved</hi> in
this <hi>World,</hi> God will condemn him in
the other. And consequently, he who
places his Salvation upon this Ground,
will find himself like an imprisoned and
condemned Malefactor, who in the
Night dreams, that he is released, but
in the Morning finds himself led to the
<hi>Gallows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> No Advantages <hi>from
External Church-Membership, or Profession
of the true Religion,</hi> can of themselves
give a Man Confidence towards God.
And yet perhaps, there is hardly any
one Thing in the World, which Men,
in all Ages, have, generally, more chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselves with. The Jews were an
Eminent Instance of this. Who, because
they were the <hi>Sons of Abraham,</hi> as it is
readily acknowledged by our Saviour,
<hi>Iohn 8. 37. And because they were entrusted
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:107166:279"/>
with the Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 2. <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Covenants, and the Promises,
Rom.</hi> 9. 4. That is, in other Words, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were the <hi>True Church,</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of the <hi>True Religion</hi> (while all the
World, about them, lay wallowing in
<hi>Ignorance, Heathenism,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi>) they
concluded from hence, that God was so
fond of them, that notwithstanding all
their Villainies, and Immoralities, they
were still the Darlings of Heaven, and the
only Heirs Apparent of Salvation. They
thought (it seems) God and themselves
linked together in so <hi>fast,</hi> but withall so
<hi>strange</hi> a Covenant, that although they
never performed their part of it, God
was yet bound to make good every
Tittle of his.</p>
            <p>And this made <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> set
himself with so much Acrimony, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
to baffle this Senseless, Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Conceit of theirs, which made them
huff at the Doctrine of Repentance, as a
Thing below them, and not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:107166:279"/>
to them; In <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. v. 9.
<hi>Think not</hi> (says he) <hi>to say within your
selves, we have Abraham to our Father.</hi>
This he knew lay deep in their <hi>Hearts,</hi>
and was still in their <hi>Mouths,</hi> and kept
them Insolent, and Impenitent under Sins
of the highest and most clamorous
Guilt; <hi>though</hi> our Saviour himself also,
not long after this, assured them that
they were of a very different Stock, and
Parentage from that, which they boasted
of; and that whosoever was their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
upon the <hi>Natural</hi> Account, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
was certainly so upon a <hi>Moral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, how vainly do the
Romanists pride, and value themselves
upon the Name of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion,</hi> and of the <hi>Catholick
Church?</hi> though a Title no more appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> than a Man's
<hi>Finger,</hi> when it is swelled and putrefied,
can be called his <hi>whole Body:</hi> a Church
which allows <hi>Salvation</hi> to none without
it, nor awards <hi>Damnation</hi> to almost any
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:107166:280"/>
within it. And therefore, as the former
Empty <hi>Plea</hi> served the sottish <hi>Iews;</hi> so,
no wonder, if this equally serves these,
to put them into a <hi>Fools Paradise,</hi> by
feeding their Hopes, without changing
their Lives; and, as an Excellent Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
first to assure them of Heaven,
and then to bring them easily to it; and
so in a word, to save both <hi>their Souls,</hi>
and <hi>their Sins</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And to shew, how the same Cheat
runs through all Professions, though not
in the same Dress; none are more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and grosly under it, than another
Sort of Men, who, on the Contrary,
place <hi>their whole Acceptance with God,</hi> and
indeed, their whole <hi>Religion,</hi> upon a <hi>Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Zeal</hi> (or rather out-cry) against <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and Superstition;</hi> verbally, indeed,
uttered <hi>against the Church of Rome,</hi> but
really meant against the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
To which Sort of Persons I shall
say no more but this, (and that in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Truth and Meekness) <hi>namely;</hi> That
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:107166:280"/>
Zeal and Noise <hi>against Popery,</hi> and real
Services <hi>for it,</hi> are no such inconsistent
Things, as some may imagine; indeed
no more than <hi>Invectives against Papists,
and solemn Addresses of Thanks to them,</hi> for
that very Thing, by which they would
have brought in Popery upon us. And
if those of the Separation do not yet
know so much, (thanks to them for it)
we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do; and so
may they themselves too, in due time.
I speak not this by way of <hi>Sarcasm,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
them, (I leave that to their own
Consciences, which will do it more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually)
but by way of <hi>Charity</hi> to warn
them: For let them be assured, that this
whole Scene and Practice of theirs, is as
really <hi>Superstition,</hi> and as false a Bottom
to rest their Souls upon, as either <hi>the
Iews alledging Abraham for their Father,</hi>
while the <hi>Devil</hi> claimed them for his <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi>
or the Papists relying upon <hi>their
Indulgences,</hi> their <hi>Saints Merits,</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogations,</hi>
and such other Fopperies,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:107166:281"/>
as can never <hi>settle,</hi> nor indeed so much
as <hi>reach,</hi> the Conscience; and much less
recommend it <hi>to that Iudge,</hi> who is not
to be flamm'd off with Words and Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and <hi>Names,</hi> though taken out of
the Scripture it self.</p>
            <p>Nay, and I shall proceed yet further.
It is not a Man's being of the <hi>Church of
England</hi> it self (though undoubtedly the
purest and best reformed Church in the
World; indeed so well reformed, that it
will be found a much easier Work <hi>to
alter,</hi> than to <hi>better</hi> its Constitution;) I
say, it is not a Man's being even of this
Excellent Church, which can of it self
clear Accounts between God and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
Since bare Communion with a
good Church, can never alone <hi>make
a good Man:</hi> For, if it could, I am sure
we should have no bad ones in ours;
and much less such as would betray it.</p>
            <p>So that we see here, that it is but too
manifest, that Men of all Churches,
Sects and Perswasions, are <hi>strangely</hi> apt
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:107166:281"/>
to flatter, and deceive themselves with
what they <hi>believe,</hi> and what they <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess;</hi>
and if we throughly consider the
Matter, we shall find the Fallacy to lie
in this. That those Religious Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which God designed only for <hi>Means,
Helps,</hi> and <hi>Advantages,</hi> to promote and
further Men in the Practice of Holiness,
they look upon rather, as a <hi>Privilege</hi> to
serve them <hi>instead of it,</hi> and really to
commute <hi>for it.</hi> This is the very
Case, and a fatal Self-imposture it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
and such an one as defeats the
Design, and <hi>destroys</hi> the Force of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>And thus, I have shewn <hi>four</hi> several,
uncertain, and deceitfull <hi>Rules,</hi> which
Men are prone to judge of their <hi>Spiritual
Estate</hi> by.</p>
            <p>But now, have we any better or more
certain, to substitute, and recommend in
the Room of them? Why, yes; if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Apostle, a Man's own <hi>Heart</hi> or
<hi>Conscience</hi> is that, which, above all other
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:107166:282"/>
Things, is able to give him <hi>Confidence
towards God.</hi> And the Reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Heart knows that by it self,
which, nothing in the World besides,
can give it any <hi>knowledge</hi> of; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Knowledge of which, it can have
no Foundation to build any true Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon. <hi>Conscience,</hi> under God, is the
only competent Judge of what the Soul
has done, and what it has not done;
what Guilt it has contracted, and what
it has not; as it is in 1 <hi>Corinth. 2. 11.
What Man knoweth the Things of a Man,
save the Spirit of Man which is in him?</hi>
Conscience is its own Counsellor, the
sole Master of its own Secrets: And it is
the Privilege of our Nature, that every
Man should keep the Key of his own
Breast.</p>
            <p>Now for the further Prosecution of
the Words, I shall <hi>do these four Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I shall shew, how the <hi>Heart</hi> or
<hi>Conscience</hi> ought to be informed, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to its founding in us a rational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
towards God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="551" facs="tcp:107166:282"/>
2. I shall shew, <hi>how</hi> and <hi>by what
means we may</hi> get it thus informed, and
afterwards preserve and keep it so.</p>
            <p>3. I shall shew, <hi>Whence it is</hi> that the
Testimony of Conscience thus informed
comes to be so Authentick, and so much
to be relied upon: And,</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> I shall assign <hi>some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Cases or Instances,</hi> in which the
Confidence suggested by it, does most
eminently shew, and exert it self.</p>
            <p>1. And first for the First of these,
<hi>How the Heart or Conscience,</hi> &amp;c. It is
certain, that no Man can have any such
Confidence towards God, only because
his Heart tells him <hi>a Lye;</hi> and that it
may do so, is altogether as certain. For
there is the Erroneous, as well as the
rightly informed Conscience; and if the
Conscience happens to be deluded, and
thereupon to give <hi>false Directions</hi> to the
Will, so that by Vertue of those <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
it is betrayed into a Course of Sin:
Sin does not therefore cease to be Sin,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:107166:283"/>
because a Man committed it <hi>Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</hi>
If Conscience comes to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
so far, as to bring a Man under a
Perswasion, that it is either Lawfull,
or his Duty, <hi>to resist the Magistrate, to
seize upon his Neighbours just Rights, or
Estate, to worship Stocks and Stones, or to
lye, equivocate,</hi> and the like, this will not
<hi>absolve</hi> him before God; since Errour,
which is in it self, <hi>Evil,</hi> can never make
another Thing <hi>Good.</hi> He who does an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
Action, through a false <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
which <hi>Information</hi> he ought not to
have believed, cannot in Reason <hi>make
the Guilt of one Sin, the Excuse of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conscience therefore must be rightly
informed, before the Testimony of it
can be Authentick, in what it pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
concerning the Estate of the Soul.
It must proceed by the Two grand Rules
of <hi>Right Reason and Scripture;</hi> these are
the Compass which it must steer by. For
Conscience comes <hi>formally</hi> to oblige, only
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:107166:283"/>
as it is the Messenger of the Mind of
God to the Soul of Man; which he has
revealed to him, partly by the Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of certain Notions, and Maxims up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Practical</hi> Understanding, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the declared Oracles of his Word.
So far therefore as Conscience reports a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Thing agreeable to, or deducible
from these, it is to be hearkened to, as
the Great Conveyer of Truth to the Soul;
but when it reports any Thing dissonant
to these, it obliges no more than the
Falshood reported by it.</p>
            <p>But since there is none who follows
an <hi>Erroneous Conscience,</hi> but does so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he thinks it <hi>true,</hi> and moreover
thinks it true, because he is perswaded,
that it proceeds according to the Two
forementioned Rules of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and
<hi>Right Reason;</hi> how shall a Man be able
to satisfie himself, when his Conscience is
<hi>rightly informed,</hi> and when <hi>possessed with
an Errour?</hi> For to affirm, that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
passed by a <hi>rightly informed Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
               <pb n="554" facs="tcp:107166:284"/>
gives a Man a rational Confidence
towards God; but, in the mean time,
not to assign any means possible, by
which he may know, when his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is thus <hi>rightly informed,</hi> and <hi>when
not,</hi> it must equally bereave him of such
a Confidence, as placing the Condition
upon which it depends wholly out of his
Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Here therefore is the Knot, here the
Difficulty, how to state some Rule of
Certainty, by which Infallibly to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
when the Conscience is <hi>right,
and to be relied upon; When erroneous, and
to be distrusted,</hi> in the Testimony it gives
about the Sincerity, and Safety of a
Man's spiritual Condition.</p>
            <p>For the Resolution of which, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That it is not necessary for a Man
to be assured of the <hi>Rightness</hi> of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
by such an <hi>infallible Certainty of
Perswasion,</hi> as amounts to the Clearness
of a Demonstration; but it is sufficient,
if he knows it upon Grounds of such a
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:107166:284"/>
convincing Probability, as shall exclude
all rational Grounds of doubting of it.
For, I cannot think, that <hi>the Confidence,</hi>
here spoken of, rises so high as to <hi>Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
And the Reason is, because it is
manifestly such a <hi>Confidence,</hi> as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all sincere Christians. Which
yet, <hi>Assurance</hi> (we all know) is not.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, the Word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>Freedom, or Boldness of Speech;</hi>
though <hi>the Latin</hi> Translation renders it
by <hi>Fiducia,</hi> and so corresponds with the
<hi>English,</hi> which renders it by <hi>Confidence.</hi>
But whether <hi>Fiducia,</hi> or <hi>Confidence</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
the full Sence of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, may very
well be disputed. However it is certain,
that neither the Word in the <hi>Original,</hi> nor
yet in the <hi>Translation,</hi> imports <hi>Assurance.</hi>
For <hi>Freedom,</hi> or <hi>Boldness of Speech,</hi> I am
sure, does not; and <hi>Fiducia,</hi> or <hi>Confidence,</hi>
signifies only a Man's being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
perswaded of a Thing, upon better
Arguments for it, than any that he can
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:107166:285"/>
see against it; which he may very well
be, and yet not <hi>be assured</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>From all which, I conclude; That the
<hi>Confidence</hi> here mentioned in the Text,
amounts to no more, than <hi>a Rational
well grounded Hope.</hi> Such an one, as the
Apostle tells us, in <hi>Rom. 5. 5. Maketh
not ashamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon these Terms, I affirm, <hi>That
such a Conscience,</hi> as has imployed the
Utmost of its Ability to give it self the
best Information, and clearest Knowledge
of its Duty, that it can, is a Rational
Ground for a Man to build <hi>such an Hope
upon;</hi> and, consequently, for him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in.</p>
            <p>There is an <hi>innate Light</hi> in every Man,
discovering to him the first Lines of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in the common Notions of <hi>Good and
Evil;</hi> which by Cultivation, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
may be advanced to higher,
and brighter Discoveries. And from
hence it is, that the Schoolmen, and
Moralists, admit not of any <hi>Ignorantia
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:107166:285"/>
Iuris,</hi> speaking of <hi>Natural Moral Right,</hi>
to give excuse to Sin. Since all such Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
is <hi>voluntary,</hi> and therefore cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable;
for as much as it was in every
Man's Power to have prevented it, by a
due Improvement of the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi>
and the Seeds of Moral Honesty sown
in his Heart.</p>
            <p>If it be here demanded, Whether a
Man may not remain ignorant of his
Duty, after he has used the <hi>utmost means</hi>
to inform himself of it? I answer, That
so much of Duty as is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to save him, he shall upon the use
of such a Course come to know; and
that which he continues ignorant of, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done the utmost lying in his Power,
that he might not be ignorant of it, shall
never damn him. Which Assertion is
proved thus: The Gospel damns no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for being ignorant of that which he
is not obliged to know; but that, which
upon the Improvement of a Man's ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Power, he cannot know, he is not
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:107166:286"/>
obliged to know; for that otherwise he
would be obliged to an Impossibility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>,
since that which is out of the Compass
of any Man's Power, is to that Man
<hi>Impossible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He therefore who exerts all the Powers,
and Faculties of his Soul, and plies all
Means and Opportunities in the Search
of Truth, which God has vouchsafed
him, may rest upon the Judgment of
his Conscience so informed, as a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
Guide of those Actions, which
he must account to God for. And if
by following such a Guide, he falls into
the <hi>Ditch,</hi> the <hi>Ditch</hi> shall never drown
him, or if it should, the Man perishes
not by his <hi>Sin,</hi> but by his <hi>Misfortune.</hi>
In a word, he who endeavours to
know the utmost of his Duty, that
he can, and practises the utmost that
he knows, has the Equity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the great God to stand as
a mighty Wall, or Rampart between
him, and Damnation, for any Errours
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:107166:286"/>
or Infirmities, which the Frailty of his
Condition has invincibly, and therefore
<hi>inculpably</hi> exposed him to.</p>
            <p>And if a Conscience thus qualified,
and informed, be not the <hi>Measure,</hi> by
which a Man may take a true Estimate
of his Absolution, before the Tribunal
of God, all the Understanding of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, cannot find out any
Ground for the Sinner to pitch the Sole
of his Foot upon, or rest his Conscience
with any Assurance, but is left in the
Plunge of Infinite Doubts, and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
Suspicions, and Misgivings, both
as to the Measures of his present Duty,
and the final Issues of his future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>Let this <hi>Conclusion</hi> therefore stand as
the firm Result of the foregoing Discourse,
and the Foundation of what is to follow;
That such a Conscience, as has not been
wanting to it self, in endeavouring to
get the <hi>utmost,</hi> and clearest Information
about the Will of God, that its Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="560" facs="tcp:107166:287"/>
Advantages, and Opportunities could
afford it, is that great <hi>Internal Iudge,
whose Absolution is a Rational, and sure
Ground of Confidence towards God:</hi> And
so I pass to the second Thing proposed.
Which is to shew, <hi>How, and by what
Means, we may get our Heart or Conscience
thus informed, and afterwards preserve and
keep it so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to which amongst many
Things, that might be alleaged as highly
usefull, and conducing to this great
Work. I shall insist upon these Four:
As,</p>
            <p>1. Let a Man carefully attend to the
<hi>Voice</hi> of his <hi>Reason,</hi> and all the Dictates
of Natural Morality; so as by no means,
to doe any thing contrary to them. For
though <hi>Reason is not to be relied</hi> upon, as
a Guide universally sufficient to direct
us what to doe; yet it is generally <hi>to be
relied</hi> upon, and obeyed, where it tells
us, what we are <hi>not to doe.</hi> It is, indeed,
but a weak, and diminutive <hi>Light,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:107166:287"/>
to <hi>Revelation;</hi> but it ought to be
no disparagement to a <hi>Star,</hi> that it is
not a <hi>Sun.</hi> Nevertheless, as weak, and
as small as it is, it is a <hi>Light always</hi> at
hand, and though enclosed (as it were)
in a dark Lanthorn, may yet be of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
use to prevent many a <hi>foul Step,</hi>
and to keep us from many a <hi>dangerous
Fall.</hi> And every Man brings such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of this Light into the World with
him; that <hi>though it cannot bring him to
Heaven;</hi> yet, if he be true to it, it will
carry him a great way; indeed so far,
that if he follows it faithfully, I doubt
not, but he shall meet with <hi>another Light,</hi>
which shall carry him quite through.</p>
            <p>How far it may be improved, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from that high and refined Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which shined forth both in the <hi>Lives,</hi>
and <hi>Writings</hi> of some of the Ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
who yet had no other <hi>Light</hi> but
this, both to <hi>live,</hi> and to <hi>write</hi> by. For
how great a Man in vertue was <hi>Cato;</hi>
of whom the Historian gives this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:107166:288"/>
Character; <hi>Esse quàm videri bonus
malebat?</hi> And of what an impregnable
Integrity was <hi>Fabricius;</hi> of whom it was
said, that a Man might as well attempt <hi>to
turn the Sun out of his Course,</hi> as to bring
<hi>Fabricius</hi> to doe a base, or a dishonest
Action? And then for their Writings;
what admirable Things occur in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and the Books of
<hi>Plato,</hi> and of several other Philosophers?
short, I confess, of the Rules of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
but generally above the Lives of
Christians.</p>
            <p>Which being so, ought not the <hi>Light
of Reason</hi> to be look'd upon by us as a
Rich, and a Noble Talent, and such an
one as we must account to God for? For
it is certainly from him. It is a Ray of
Divinity darted into the Soul. <hi>It is the
Candle of the Lord</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it) and
God never lights us up a <hi>Candle</hi> either <hi>to
put out,</hi> or to <hi>sleep by.</hi> If it be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to a <hi>Work of Darkness,</hi> it will not
fail to discover, and reprove it; and
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:107166:288"/>
therefore the <hi>checks</hi> of it are to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as the Echo of a <hi>Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
for, <hi>whatsoever Conscience binds here
on Earth,</hi> will be certainly bound there
too; and it were a great Vanity, to
hope, or imagine, that either Law or
Gospel will absolve, what Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<hi>condemns.</hi> No Man ever yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
his own <hi>Conscience,</hi> but first, or last,
it was revenged upon him for it. So
that it will concern a Man, to treat this
great Principle awfully, and warily, by
still observing what it commands, but
especially what it <hi>forbids:</hi> And, if he
would have it always a faithfull, and
sincere Monitor to him, let him be sure
never to turn a <hi>deaf Ear to it;</hi> for <hi>not to
hear</hi> it, is the Way to <hi>silence</hi> it. Let him
strictly observe the first Stirrings, and
Intimations; the first hints, and Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers
of <hi>Good and Evil,</hi> that pass in his
Heart; and this will keep Conscience so
quick, and vigilant, and ready to give
a Man true Alarms, upon the least Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:107166:289"/>
of his spiritual Enemy, that he
shall be hardly capable of a great Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, if a Man accustoms
himself to Slight, or pass over these first
Motions to Good, or Shrinkings of his
Conscience from Evil, which Originally
are as Natural to the Heart of Man, as
the <hi>Appetites of Hunger, and Thirst</hi> are
to the <hi>Stomach;</hi> Conscience will by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
grow dull, and unconcerned; and,
from not <hi>spying out Motes,</hi> come at length
to over-look <hi>Beams;</hi> from Carelesness it
shall fall into a <hi>Slumber,</hi> and from a
Slumber, it shall settle into a deep, and
long <hi>Sleep;</hi> till, at last, perhaps it sleeps
it self into a Lethargy, and that such an
one, that nothing but <hi>Hell,</hi> and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall be able to awaken it. For
long <hi>disuse</hi> of any thing made for Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will in time take away the very <hi>use</hi>
of it. As I have read of one, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for a Disguise, kept one of his Eyes
a long time covered; when he took off
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:107166:289"/>
the Covering, found his Eye indeed
where it was, but his Sight was gone.
He who would keep his Conscience <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,</hi>
must be carefull to keep it stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p>2. Let a Man be very <hi>tender,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardfull
of every pious Motion, and
Suggestion made by <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> to
his Heart. I do not hereby go about to
establish <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> or such phantastick
Pretences of Intercourse with God, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and Fanaticks (who in most Things
copy <hi>from</hi> one another, as well as rail
<hi>at</hi> one another) do usually boast of. But
certainly, if <hi>the Evil Spirit</hi> may, and often
does suggest wicked, and vile Thoughts
to the Minds of Men; as all do, and must
grant, and is sufficiently proved from the
<hi>Devil's putting it into the Heart of Iudas, to
betray Christ,</hi> John 13. 2. And his <hi>filling
the Heart of Ananias, to lye to the Holy
Ghost,</hi> Acts 5. 3. It cannot after this,
with any Colour of Reason be doubted,
but that the <hi>Holy Spirit of God,</hi> whose
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:107166:290"/>
Power, and Influence to Good is much
greater, than that of the <hi>wicked Spirit</hi> to
Evil, does frequently inject into, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
upon the Soul many blessed Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Impulses to Duty, and many
powerfull Avocations from Sin. So that
a Man shall not only (as the Prophet
says) <hi>hear a Voice behind him,</hi> but also <hi>a
Voice within him,</hi> telling him which way
he ought to go.</p>
            <p>For doubtless, there is something more
in those Expressions of <hi>being led by the
Spirit, and being taught by the Spirit,</hi> and
the like, than meer <hi>Tropes,</hi> and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors;
and nothing less is, or can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by them, than that God sometimes
<hi>speaks</hi> to, and <hi>converses with</hi> the Hearts of
Men, <hi>immediately by himself:</hi> And, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
those, who by thus hearing him speak
in a <hi>still Voice,</hi> shall prevent his speaking
to them <hi>in Thunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will here ask, perhaps, how
we shall distinguish in such Motions,
which of them proceed immediately from
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:107166:290"/>
the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and which from the
Conscience? In answer to which, I must
confess, that I know no certain Mark of
Discrimination, to distinguish them by;
save only in general, that such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
immediately from God, use to
strike the Mind suddenly, and very
powerfully. But then I add also, that
as the Knowledge of this, in Point of
Speculation, is so <hi>nice and difficult,</hi> so
(thanks be to God) in Point of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
it is not <hi>necessary.</hi> But let a Man
universally observe, and obey every good
Motion rising in his Heart, knowing that
every such Motion proceeds from God,
either <hi>mediately,</hi> or <hi>immediately;</hi> and that,
whether God speaks <hi>immediately</hi> by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Conscience, or <hi>mediately</hi> by
the Conscience to the Soul, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is the same in both, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of either is Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Now the Thing which I drive at,
under this Head of Discourse, is to shew,
<hi>That as</hi> God is sometimes pleased to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:107166:291"/>
himself, in this Manner to the
Hearts of Men; so, if the <hi>Heart will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
and <hi>answer</hi> such Motions, by a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and obsequious Compliance with
them, there is no doubt, but they will
both return more frequently, and still
more and more powerfully, till at length
they produce such <hi>a Degree of Light</hi> in
the Conscience, as shall give a Man, both
a clear <hi>Sight</hi> of his Duty, and a certain
<hi>Iudgment</hi> of his Condition.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, as all Resistance
whatsoever of the Dictates of Conscience,
even in the Way of Natural <hi>Efficiency</hi>
brings a kind of Hardness, and <hi>Stupefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
upon it; So the <hi>Resistance</hi> of these
<hi>peculiar Suggestions of the Spirit,</hi> will cause
in it also a <hi>Iudicial Hardness,</hi> which is
yet worse than the other. So that God
shall withdraw from such an Heart, and
the <hi>Spirit</hi> being <hi>grieved</hi> shall depart, and
these <hi>blessed Motions</hi> shall cease, and affect,
and visit it no more. The Consequence
of which is very terrible; as rendring a
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:107166:291"/>
Man <hi>past feeling.</hi> And then the less he
feels in this World, the more he shall <hi>be
sure</hi> to feel in the next. But,</p>
            <p>3. Because the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
is in many Things defective, and
dimn, and the <hi>Internal Voice of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
not always distinguishable, above
all, let a Man attend to the Mind of
God, uttered in his <hi>Revealed Word.</hi> I
say, his <hi>Revealed Word.</hi> By which, I
do not mean, that Mysterious, Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
(and <hi>of late,</hi> so much studied)
Book called the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and which
perhaps the more it is studied, the less 'tis
understood, as generally either finding a
Man crack'd, or making him so; But
I mean those other Writings of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
and <hi>Apostles,</hi> which exhibit to us a
plain, <hi>sure,</hi> perfect, and intelligible Rule;
a Rule that will neither fail, nor distract
such as make use of it. A Rule to judge
of the two former Rules by: For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that contradicts the <hi>Revealed Word
of God,</hi> is either the Voice of <hi>Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
               <pb n="570" facs="tcp:107166:292"/>
or of the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> nor is it
possible, that it should be so, without
God's contradicting himself.</p>
            <p>And therefore we see, what high Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
are given to the <hi>Written Word,</hi> by
the inspired Pen-men of both <hi>Testaments.
It giveth Understanding to the simple,</hi> says
<hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Psalm</hi> 119. 130. And that, you
will say, is no such easie Matter to doe.</p>
            <p>It is able to <hi>make the Man of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
(says St. <hi>Paul</hi>) 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 17. It is
quick and powerfull, and sharper than any
Two-edged Sword, piercing even to the
dividing asunder of the Soul, and Spirit; and
is a Discerner of the Thoughts, and Intents of
the Heart,</hi> Heb. 4. 12. Now what a
Force and Fulness, what a Vigour and
Emphasis is there in all these Expressions!
Enough (one would think) to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
and endear the Scriptures, even to
the Papists themselves. For if (as the Text
says) <hi>They give understanding to the simple;</hi>
I know none more concerned to read,
and study them, than their Popes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="571" facs="tcp:107166:292"/>
Wherefore since the <hi>Light,</hi> and Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of the <hi>Written Word</hi> is so mighty, let
a Man bring and hold his Conscience to
this steady Rule: the unalterable Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of which, will infallibly discover the
<hi>Rectitude,</hi> or <hi>Obliquity,</hi> of whatsoever it is
applied to. We shall find it a <hi>Rule,</hi> both
to instruct us what <hi>to doe,</hi> and to assure
us in what <hi>we have done.</hi> For though
<hi>Natural Conscience</hi> ought to be listned to,
yet it is <hi>Revelation</hi> alone, that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
upon: <hi>As we</hi> may observe in the
Works of Art, a Judicious Artist will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>use</hi> his <hi>Eye,</hi> but he will <hi>trust</hi> only
to his Rule.</p>
            <p>There is not any one Action what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
which a Man <hi>ought to doe,</hi> or to
<hi>forbear,</hi> but the Scripture will give him a
clear Precept, or Prohibition for it.</p>
            <p>So that if a Man will commit such
Rules to his Memory, and stock his
Mind with Portions of Scripture answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to all the Heads of Duty and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
his Conscience can never be at a
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:107166:293"/>
Loss, either for a Direction of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or an Answer to a Temptation: It
was the very Course which our Saviour
himself took, when the Devil plied him
with Temptation upon Temptation.
Still he had a <hi>sutable Scripture</hi> ready to
repell, and baffle them all, one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
Every pertinent Text urged home,
being a direct Stabb to a Temptation.</p>
            <p>Let a Man therefore consider, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with himself the several Duties,
and Vertues of a Christian. Such as,
<hi>Temperance, Meekness, Charity, Purity of
Heart, Pardoning of Enemies, Patience.</hi>
(I had almost said, <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> too,
but that such old fashioned Christianity,
seems as much out of Date with some,
<hi>as Christ's Divinity, and Satisfaction.</hi>) I
say, let a Man consider these, and the
like <hi>Vertues,</hi> together with the <hi>contrary
Sins and Vices,</hi> that do oppose them;
and then, as out of a full Armory, or
Magazine, let him furnish his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with Texts of Scripture, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:107166:293"/>
enjoyning the one, and forbidding,
or threatning the other. And yet I do not
say, that he should stuff his Mind like the
<hi>Margent</hi> of some Authors, with <hi>Chapter</hi>
and <hi>Verse</hi> heaped together, at all Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but only that he should sortifie it
with some few Texts, which are home,
and apposite to his Case. And a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
thus supplied, will be like a Man
armed at all Points; and always ready
either to receive, or to attack his Enemy.
Otherwise it is not a Man's <hi>having Arms
in his house;</hi> no, nor yet his having Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and Skill to use them; but it is his
having them still about him, which must
both secure him from being set upon, and
defend him when he is.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, Men must know, that
without taking the forementioned Course,
all that they do in this Matter, is but
lost Labour; and that they <hi>read the
Scriptures</hi> to as little purpose, as <hi>some
use to quote them;</hi> Much <hi>Reading</hi> being
like much <hi>Eating,</hi> wholly useless without
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:107166:294"/>
Digestion; and it is impossible for a Man
to digest his Meat, without also retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
            <p>Till Men get what they read into
their <hi>Minds,</hi> and fix it in their <hi>Memories,</hi>
they keep their Religion as they use to
doe their Bibles, only in their Closet, or
carry it in their Pocket; and that, you
may imagine, must improve, and affect
the Soul, just as much as a Man's having
plenty of Provision only in his Stores,
will nourish, and support his Body.
When Men forget the Word heard, or
read by them, the <hi>Devil is said to steal it
out of their Hearts,</hi> Luke 8. 12. And
for this Cause, we do with as much <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
as <hi>Propriety of Speech,</hi> call the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of a Thing to memory, the <hi>get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it by heart.</hi> For it is the <hi>Memory,</hi> that
must transmit it to the <hi>Heart;</hi> and it is
in vain to expect, that the Heart should
keep its hold of any Truth, when the
Memory has let it go.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="575" facs="tcp:107166:294"/>
4. The <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> way, that I
shall mention, <hi>for the getting of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
rightly informed,</hi> and afterwards <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
it so, is frequently and impartially to
account with it. It is with a Man and
his Conscience, as with one Man, and
another; amongst whom we use to say,
that <hi>Even Reckoning makes lasting Friends;</hi>
and the way to make Reckonings <hi>even,</hi> I
am sure, is to make them <hi>often.</hi> Delays
in Accompts are always suspicious; and
bad enough in themselves, but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
much worse in their Cause. For, to
<hi>deferr</hi> an Accompt, is the ready way to
<hi>perplex</hi> it; and, when it comes to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
and intricate, no Man, either as
to his Temporal or Spiritual Estate, can
know of himself <hi>what he is, or what he
has,</hi> or upon what bottom he stands.
But the amazing Difficulty, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Account, will rather terrifie
than inform him; and keep him from
setting heartily about such a Task, as
he despairs ever to go through with. For,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:107166:295"/>
no Man willingly begins, what he has
no hope to finish.</p>
            <p>But, let a Man apply to this Work, by
frequent Returns, and short Intervals,
while the Heap is small, and the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
few, and he will find it easie, and
conquerable; And his Conscience, like
a faithfull Steward, shall give him in a
plain, open, and entire Account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and hide nothing from him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we know, if a Steward or Cashier be
suffered to run on from year to year
without bringing him to a Reckoning,
it is odds but such a sottish forbearance,
will, in time, teach him to shuffle; and
strongly tempt him to be a Cheat, if
not also make him so: For, as the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
<hi>runs on,</hi> generally the Accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<hi>goes backward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this Cause, some judge it
adviseable for a Man to account with
<hi>his Heart</hi> every day; and this, no doubt,
is the best, and surest Course; for still
the <hi>oftener,</hi> the <hi>better.</hi> And some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:107166:295"/>
Accompting once a Week; longer
than which it is, by no means, safe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
it: For, a Man shall find his Heart
deceitfull, and his Memory weak, and
Nature extremely averse from seeking
narrowly after That, which it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to find; and being found, will
assuredly disturb it.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole matter it is
infinitely absurd to think that <hi>Conscience</hi>
can be kept in order without frequent
Examination. If a man would have his
Conscience deal clearly with him, he
must deal severely with That. Often
<hi>scouring</hi> and cleansing it will make it
<hi>bright;</hi> and, when it is so, he may see
himself in it: And, if he sees any Thing
amiss, let this satisfie him, That no man
is, or can be, the <hi>worse</hi> for knowing the
very <hi>worst</hi> of himself.</p>
            <p>On the contrary; if <hi>Conscience</hi> by a
long neglect of, and dis-acquaintance
with it self, comes to contract an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Rust or Soil, a man may as well
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:107166:296"/>
expect to see his Face in a <hi>Mud-wall,</hi> as
that such a Conscience should give him
a true Report of his Condition; no, it
leaves him wholly in the Dark, as to
the greatest Concern he has in both
Worlds. He can neither tell, whether
God be his <hi>Friend,</hi> or his <hi>Enemy,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he has shrewd Cause to suspect him
his <hi>Enemy,</hi> and cannot possibly know
him to be his <hi>Friend.</hi> And this being
his Case, he must live in Ignorance, and
die in Ignorance; and it will be hard
for a man to die <hi>in it,</hi> without dying
<hi>for it</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And now, what a <hi>wretched</hi> Condition
must that man needs be in, whose Heart
is in such Confusion, such Darkness, and
such a settled Blindness, that it shall not
be able to tell him so much as one true
Word of himself? <hi>Flatter</hi> him it may
(I confess) (as those are generally good
at <hi>flattering,</hi> who are good for nothing
else) but, in the mean time, the poor
Man is left under the fatal Necessity of
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:107166:296"/>
a remediless Delusion: For, in judging
of a man's Self, if <hi>Conscience</hi> either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
or will not inform him, there is a
certain Thing called <hi>Self-love</hi> that will
be sure to deceive him. And thus I
have shewn, in four several Particulars,
<hi>what is to be done,</hi> both for the getting
and keeping of the Conscience, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
as that it may be able to give
us a Rational <hi>Confidence towards God.</hi>
As,</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Voice</hi> of Reason, in all
the Dictates of <hi>Natural Morality,</hi> ought
carefully to be attended to by a strict
Observance of what it <hi>commands,</hi> but
especially of what it <hi>forbids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That every Pious Motion from
<hi>the Spirit of God</hi> ought tenderly to be
cherished, and by no means checked
or <hi>quenched</hi> either by Resistance or Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
            <p>3. That <hi>Conscience</hi> is to be kept close
to the Rule of the written Word.</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> That it is frequently
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:107166:297"/>
to be examined, and severely accounted
with.</p>
            <p>And, I doubt not, but a <hi>Conscience</hi>
thus disciplined, shall give a man such
a faithfull Account of himself, as shall
never shame, nor lurch the <hi>Confidence,</hi>
which he shall take up from it.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, to prevent all mistakes
in so critical a Case, and so high a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.
I shall close up the foregoing
Particulars with this <hi>twofold Caution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Let no man <hi>think,</hi> that every
<hi>Doubting</hi> or <hi>Mis-giving</hi> about the Safety
of his Spiritual Estate, over-throws the
<hi>Confidence hitherto spoken of.</hi> For (as I
shew before) the <hi>Confidence</hi> mentioned
in the Text, is not properly <hi>Assurance,</hi>
but only a <hi>Rational, well-grounded Hope;</hi>
And therefore may very well consist
with some Returns of <hi>Doubting.</hi> For,
we know, in that Pious and Excellent
<hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> made by the poor
Man to our Saviour, in <hi>Mark 9. 24.
how,</hi> in the very same Breath, in which
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:107166:297"/>
he says, <hi>Lord, I believe;</hi> He says also,
<hi>Lord, help my unbelief.</hi> So that we see
here, that the Sincerity of our <hi>Faith</hi> or
<hi>Confidence</hi> will not secure us against all
Vicissitudes of Wavering or Distrust;
indeed, no more than a strong Athle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Constitution of Body will secure a
man always against Heats, and Colds,
and Rheums, and such-like <hi>Indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And one great Reason of this, is;
Because such a <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Confidence</hi> as we
have been treating of, resides in the Soul
or Conscience, as <hi>an Habit.</hi> And <hi>Habits,</hi>
we know, are by no means either incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with, or destroyed by every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<hi>Act.</hi> But, especially, in the Case
now before us, where the Truth and
Strength of <hi>our Confidence towards God</hi>
does not consist so much, <hi>in the present
Act,</hi> by which it exerts it self, no, nor
yet <hi>in the Habit</hi> producing this Act; as
it does in the <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Reason,</hi> which
this Confidence is <hi>built upon;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:107166:298"/>
the <hi>standing sincerity of a man's Heart,</hi>
though the present <hi>Act</hi> be interrupted,
(as, no doubt, through <hi>Infirmity,</hi> or
<hi>Temptation,</hi> it may be very often,) yet,
so long as <hi>that sincerity,</hi> upon which this
<hi>Confidence</hi> was first founded, does conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
as soon as the <hi>Temptation</hi> is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and gone, the fore-mentioned <hi>Faith,</hi>
or <hi>Affiance,</hi> will, by renewed, vigorous
and fresh Acts, recover and exert it self,
and with great comfort, and satisfaction
of mind, give a man <hi>confidence towards
God.</hi> Which, though it be, indeed, a
lower, and a lesser thing than <hi>Assurance,</hi>
yet, as to all the Purposes of a Pious
Life, may, for ought I see, prove much
more usefull; as both affording a man <hi>due
comfort,</hi> and yet leaving room for <hi>due cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
too; which are Two of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Uses that Religion serves for, in this
<hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The other <hi>Caution,</hi> with reference
to the foregoing Discourse, is this: <hi>Let
no man,</hi> from what has been said, reckon
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:107166:298"/>
a <hi>bare silence of Conscience</hi> in not <hi>accusing,</hi>
or <hi>disturbing</hi> him, a sufficient Argument
for <hi>Confidence towards God.</hi> For, such
a <hi>Silence</hi> is so far from being always
so, that it is usually worse than the
fiercest and loudest <hi>Accusations;</hi> since it
may, and for the most part does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
from a kind of <hi>numbness,</hi> or stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of <hi>Conscience;</hi> and an absolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
obtained by Sin over the Soul;
so that it shall not so much as <hi>dare to
complain, or make a stir.</hi> For, as our
Saviour says, <hi>Luke 11. 21. while the strong
Man armed keeps his Palace, his Goods are
in peace.</hi> So, while Sin rules and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
with a strong Hand, and has
wholly subdued the Conscience to a sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
Subjection to its Tyrannical Yoke,
the Soul <hi>shall be at Peace,</hi> such a false
<hi>Peace</hi> as it is; but for that very Cause
<hi>worse</hi> a great deal, and more destructive,
than, when, by continual Alarms and
Assaults, it gives a man neither Peace
nor Truce, Quiet nor Intermission. And
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:107166:299"/>
therefore it is very remarkable, that the
Text expresses the sound Estate of the
Heart or the Conscience, here spoken of,
not barely by its <hi>not accusing,</hi> but by its
<hi>not condemning</hi> us; which word imports
properly an Acquitment, or Discharge
of a man upon some precedent <hi>Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and <hi>a full Trial and Cognizance of his
Cause</hi> had thereupon. For as <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
being a <hi>Law Term,</hi> and so relating
to the Judicial Proceedings of <hi>Law Courts,</hi>
must still pre-suppose an Hearing of the
Cause, before any Sentence can pass;
so likewise in the <hi>Court of Conscience,</hi>
there must be a strict and impartial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into all a man's Actions, and a
through heaving of all that can be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for, and against him, before Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can rationally either <hi>condemn,</hi> or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
him:</hi> And if, indeed, upon such a
fair and full Trial he can come off, he
is then <hi>Rectus in curiâ,</hi> clear and <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi>
and consequently may reap all that
satisfaction from himself, which it is
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:107166:299"/>
Natural for <hi>Innocence</hi> to afford the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who has it. I do not here speak of
a <hi>Legal Innocence,</hi> (none but Sots and
Quakers dream of such things;) For,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Galat. 2. 16. By the
Works of the Law shall no flesh living be
justified:</hi> But I speak of an <hi>Evangelical
Innocence;</hi> such an one as the Oeconomy
of the Gospel accepts, whatsoever the
Law enjoyns; and though mingled with
several Infirmities, and Defects, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to such a pitch of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as we call <hi>Sincerity.</hi> And whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
has this, shall never be Damned
for want of the other.</p>
            <p>And now, how vastly does it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
all those, who shall think it worth
their while to be in earnest with their
Immortal Souls, not to abuse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
themselves with a false Confidence?
a thing so easily taken up, and so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid down. Let no man conclude,
because his Conscience <hi>says nothing to
him,</hi> that therefore it <hi>has nothing to say</hi>
               <pb n="586" facs="tcp:107166:300"/>
Possibly some never so much as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the safety of their Spiritual Estate,
in all their Lives; and if so, let them
not flatter themselves, but rest assured,
that they have so much the more reason
a great deal to doubt of it now. For
the Causes of such a profound <hi>stillness,</hi>
are generally gross Ignorance, or long
Custom of Sinning, or both; and these
are very dreadfull Symptoms indeed, to
such as are not <hi>Hell and Damnation-proof.</hi>
When a man's Wounds cease to <hi>smart,</hi>
only because he has lost his <hi>feeling,</hi> they
are never the less <hi>mortal</hi> for his not see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Need of a <hi>Chirurgeon.</hi> It is not
meer, actual, present Ease, but Ease after
Pain, which brings the most durable
and solid Comfort. Acquitment before
Trial can be no security. <hi>Great</hi> and
<hi>strange Calms</hi> usually portend, and go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the most violent <hi>Storms.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
since <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Calms</hi> (especially
with reference to the State of the Soul)
doe always follow one another; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:107166:300"/>
of the Two, it is much more Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
to have the <hi>Storm first,</hi> and the
<hi>Calm afterwards:</hi> Since a Calm before a
Storm is commonly a Peace of a man's
own making; <hi>but a Calm, after a Storm,</hi>
a Peace of God's.</p>
            <p>To which God, who only can speak such
Peace to us, as neither the World not
the Devil shall be able to take from us,
be rendred and ascribed, as is most due,
all Praise, Might, Majesty, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
both now, and for ever-more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

have Confidence towards God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Have discoursed once already upon
these Words in this place. In which
Discourse, after I had set down <hi>four se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
false Grounds,</hi> upon which, Men, in
judging of the safety of their Spiritual
Estate, were apt <hi>to found a wrong Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
towards God,</hi> and shewn the Falsity
of them all; and, that there was nothing
but <hi>a Man's own Heart or Conscience,</hi> which,
in this great Concern, he could with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
safety rely upon; I did, in the next
place, cast the further Prosecution of the
Words under these <hi>four following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To shew, <hi>How the Heart or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
ought to be Informed, in order
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:107166:303"/>
to its founding in us a Rational Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
towards God.</p>
            <p>2. To shew, <hi>How, and by what means</hi>
we may get our Conscience thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and afterwards preserve and
keep it so.</p>
            <p>3. To shew, <hi>Whence it is,</hi> that the
Testimony of Conscience, thus inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
comes to be so Authentick, and so
much to be relied upon. And,</p>
            <p>4ly. and Lastly, <hi>To assign some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Cases or Instances,</hi> in which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
suggested by it, does most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
shew, and exert it self.</p>
            <p>Upon the first of which Heads; to
wit, <hi>How the Heart or Conscience ought to
be Informed, in order to its founding in us
a Rational Confidence towards God,</hi> after I
had premised something about an <hi>Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Conscience,</hi> and shewn, both what
<hi>Influence</hi> that ought to have upon us,
and what <hi>Regard</hi> we ought to have to
that, in this matter, I gathered the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of all into this one Conclusion;
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:107166:303"/>
Namely, <hi>That such a Conscience, as has
not been wanting to it self, in endeavouring
the utmost Knowledge of its Duty, and the
clearest Information about the Will of God,
that its Power, Advantages, and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
could afford it, is that great Internal
Iudge, whose Absolution is a Rational, and
sure Ground of Confidence towards God.</hi>
This I then insisted upon at large, and
from thence proceeded to the</p>
            <p>2<hi>d.</hi> Particular; Which was to shew,
<hi>How, and by what means we might get our
Conscience thus Informed, and afterwards
preserve and keep it so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where, amongst those many Ways
and Methods, which might, no doubt,
have been assigned, as highly conducing
to this purpose, I singled out, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon, only these Four. As,</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> That <hi>the Voice of Reason, in all the
Dictates of Natural Morality,</hi> was still
carefully to be attended to by a strict
observance of what it commanded, but
especially, of what it forbad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="594" facs="tcp:107166:304"/>
2<hi>ly.</hi> That <hi>every Pious Motion from the
Spirit of God</hi> was tenderly to be cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and by no means quenched or check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either by Resistance or Neglect.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> That Conscience was still to be
<hi>kept close to the Rule of God's written
Word;</hi> And,</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly, That it was frequently
to be examined, and severely accounted with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things also, I then more fully
enlarged upon; and so closed up all
with a <hi>double Caution,</hi> and that of no
small Importance as to the Case then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us: As,</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That no man</hi> should reckon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>doubting or mis-giving of his Heart,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the safety of his Spiritual Estate,
inconsistent with that <hi>Confidence towards
God,</hi> which is here spoken of in the Text:
And, secondly, <hi>That no man</hi> should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
a <hi>bare silence of Conscience</hi> in not
<hi>accusing or disturbing him,</hi> a sufficient
ground for such a Confidence. Of both
which, I then shew the Fatal Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:107166:304"/>
And so, not to trouble you
with any more Repetitions than these,
which were just necessary to lay before
you the Coherence of one thing with
another, I shall now pass to the <hi>Third</hi>
of those Four Particulars first proposed:
Which was to shew, <hi>Whence it is, that the</hi>
Testimony of Conscience (concerning a man's
Spiritual Estate) comes to be so Authentick,
and so much to be relied upon.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>credit</hi> of its Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
stands upon this double Ground.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>High Office,</hi> which it holds
immediately from God himself, in the
Soul of Man; And,</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> Those <hi>Properties</hi> or <hi>Qualities</hi> which
peculiarly fit it for the discharge of this
<hi>High Office,</hi> in all Things relating to the
Soul.</p>
            <p>1. And first, for its <hi>Office.</hi> It is no
less than <hi>God's Vicegerent</hi> or <hi>Deputy,</hi> doing
all things by immediate Commission
from Him. It commands, and dictates
every thing in God's Name; and stamps
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:107166:305"/>
every <hi>word</hi> with an Almighty Authority.
So that it is (as it were) a kind of <hi>Copy</hi>
or <hi>Transcript</hi> of the Divine Sentence, and
an Interpreter of the Sense of Heaven.
And from hence it is, that <hi>Sins against
Conscience</hi> (as all <hi>Sins against Light and
Conviction</hi> are, by way of Eminence, so
called) are of so peculiar and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
a guilt. For, that every such Sin
is a daring and direct Defiance of the
Divine Authority, as it is signified and
reported to a man by his Conscience,
and thereby ultimately terminates in
God himself.</p>
            <p>Nay, and this <hi>Vicegerent of God</hi> has
one <hi>Prerogative</hi> above all God's other
Earthly Vicegerents; to wit, that <hi>it can
never be deposed.</hi> Such a strange, sacred,
and inviolable Majesty has God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
upon this Faculty; not, indeed,
as upon <hi>an Absolute, Independent Soveraign,</hi>
but yet with so great a Communication
of something next to Soveraignty, that
while it keeps within its proper compass,
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:107166:305"/>
it is controllable by no mortal Power
upon Earth. For, not the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
in the World can countermand
Conscience so far, as to make it <hi>condemn,</hi>
where it would otherwise <hi>acquit;</hi> or <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit,</hi>
where it would otherwise <hi>condemn;</hi>
No, neither <hi>Sword</hi> not <hi>Scepter</hi> can come
at it; but it is above, and beyond the
reach of both.</p>
            <p>And if it were not for this Awful
and Majestick Character which it bears,
whence could it be, that the stoutest and
bravest Hearts droop and sneak when
Conscience frowns; and the most abject
and afflicted Wretch feels an unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and even triumphant Joy, when
the <hi>Iudge within</hi> absolves and applauds
him. When a man has done any vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous
Act, though under Countenance
of the highest Place and Power, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Covert of the closest Secrecy, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
for all that, strikes him like a clap
of Thunder, and depresses him to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Trepidation, Horror, and Poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:107166:306"/>
of Spirit; So that like <hi>Nero,</hi> though
surrounded with his <hi>Roman</hi> Legions and
<hi>Pretorian</hi> Bands, he yet sculks and hides
himself, and is ready to fly <hi>to</hi> every thing
for Refuge, though he sees nothing to
fly <hi>from.</hi> And all this, because he has
heard a condemning Sentence from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which the secret fore-bodings of his
Mind tell him will be ratified by a sad
and certain Execution from above; on
the other side, what makes a man so
chearfull, so bright and confident in his
Comforts, but because he finds himself
acquitted by God's <hi>High Commissioner</hi> and
<hi>Deputy?</hi> Which is as much as a Pardon
under God's own Hand, under the <hi>Broad
Seal of Heaven</hi> (as I may so express it.)
For a King never Condemns any whom
his Judges have Absolved, nor Absolves
whom his Judges have Condemned,
whatsoever the People and Republicans
may.</p>
            <p>Now from this Principle; <hi>That the
Authority of Conscience stands founded upon
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:107166:306"/>
its Vicegerency and Deputation under God.</hi>
Several very important Inferences may,
or rather indeed unavoidably must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.
Two of which I shall single out,
and speak of: As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We collect from hence <hi>the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
and Impertinence;</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Impudence and Impiety</hi> of
most of those <hi>Pretences of Conscience,</hi>
which have born such a <hi>mighty</hi> sway all
the World over; and in these poor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
especially.</p>
            <p>1. And first, for the <hi>Absurdity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence
of them.</hi> What a rattle and a
noise has this word <hi>Conscience</hi> made? How
many Battles has it fought? how many
Churches has it robbed, ruined and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi>
to Ashes? how many Laws has
it <hi>trampled</hi> upon, <hi>dispenced</hi> with, and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed</hi>
against? And, in a word, how
many Governments has it over-turned?
Such is the mischievous force of a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Word, applied to a detestable
Thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="600" facs="tcp:107166:307"/>
The Allegation, or Plea of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
ought never to be admitted barely
for it self: For when a Thing obliges
only by a borrowed Authority, it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
to alledge it for its own. Take
a <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> a <hi>Commissioner</hi> or <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
of any Prince; and so far as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
his Prince, all that he does, or
declares under that capacity, has the same
force and validity, as if actually done,
or declared by the Prince himself in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
But then how far does this reach?
why, just so far as he keeps close to his
<hi>Instructions:</hi> But, when he once baulks
them, though what he does, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a <hi>Publick Crime,</hi> or a <hi>National Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,</hi>
yet it is but a <hi>Private Act;</hi> and
the Doer of it may chance to pay his
Head for his Presumption. For still, as
<hi>great</hi> as the Authority of such kind of
Persons is, it is not founded upon their
<hi>own Will,</hi> nor upon their <hi>own Iudgment,</hi>
but upon their <hi>Commission.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, every Dictate of this
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:107166:307"/>
               <hi>Vicegerent of God,</hi> where it has a <hi>Divine
Word or Precept</hi> to back it, carries a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Authority with it. But, if no such
<hi>Word</hi> can be produced, it may indeed
be a strong <hi>Opinion,</hi> or <hi>Perswasion,</hi> but
it is not <hi>Conscience:</hi> And no one Thing
in the World has done more Mischief,
and caused more Delusions amongst
Men, than their not distinguishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Conscience,</hi> and <hi>meer Opinion</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conscience</hi> is a Latin Word, (though
with an English Termination,) and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the very Notation of it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a <hi>double or joynt Knowledge;</hi> to wit,
One of a Divine Law or Rule, and the
Other of a man's own Action: And
so is properly <hi>the Application of a General
Law, to a Particular Instance of Practice.</hi>
The Law of God, for example, says,
<hi>Thou shalt not steal;</hi> and the Mind of
Man tells him, That the taking of such
or such a thing from a person lawfully
possessed of it, is <hi>Stealing.</hi> Whereupon,
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:107166:308"/>
the Conscience joyning the Knowledge
of both these together, pronounces in
the Name of God, <hi>That such a Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Action ought not to be done.</hi> And this
is the true procedure of Conscience, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
supposing <hi>a Law from God,</hi> before
it pretends to lay any Obligation upon
Man: For still I averr, that Conscience
neither is, nor ought to be its own
Rule.</p>
            <p>I question not, I confess, but meer
<hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>Perswasion</hi> may be every whit
as strong, and have as forcible an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon a man's Actions as <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
it self. But then (we know) <hi>Strength</hi>
or <hi>Force</hi> is one Thing, and <hi>Authority</hi>
quite another. As a Rogue upon the
High-way may have as strong an Arm,
and take off a man's Head as cleverly
as the <hi>Executioner.</hi> But then there is a
vast Disparity in the Two Actions, when
one of them is <hi>Murther,</hi> and the other
<hi>Iustice:</hi> Nay, and our Saviour himself
told his Disciples, <hi>That Men should both
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:107166:308"/>
kill them, and think that in so doing they
did God service.</hi> So that here (we see)
was a full <hi>Opinion and Perswasion,</hi> and a
very Zealous one too, of the high Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriousness
of what they did; but still
there was no <hi>Law,</hi> no <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Command</hi>
of God to ground it upon, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it was <hi>not Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Notion of Conscience</hi> thus sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if firmly kept to, and throughly
driven home, would effectually baffle
and confound all those senceless, though
clamorous Pretences, of the <hi>Schismatical
Opposers of the Constitutions of our Church.</hi>
In defence of which, I shall not speak so
much as one syllable against the <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and Toleration</hi> granted to these Men.
No; since they have it, let them (in
God's Name) enjoy it, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
make the best of it. But since I
cannot find that the <hi>Law which tolerates</hi>
them in their way of Worship (and it
does no more) does at all <hi>forbid</hi> us to
defend ours, it were earnestly to be
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:107166:309"/>
wished, that all hearty Lovers of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> would assert its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Constitution more vigorously
now than ever: And especially in such
Congregations as this; in which there
are so many young Persons, upon the
<hi>well,</hi> or <hi>ill principling</hi> of whom (next
under God) depends the happiness or
misery of this Church and State. For,
if such should be generally prevailed
upon by <hi>Hopes</hi> or <hi>Fears,</hi> by <hi>base Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
by <hi>Trimming</hi> and <hi>Time-serving,</hi>
(which are but Two Words for the
same Thing) to abandon, and betray
<hi>the Church of England,</hi> by nauseating her
pious, prudent, and wholsome Orders,
(of which I have seen some scurvy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,)
we may rest assured, That this
will certainly produce <hi>Confusion,</hi> and that
<hi>Confusion</hi> will as certainly end in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, since the <hi>Liturgy, Rites,</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of our Church, have been,
and still are, so much cavilled and struck
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:107166:309"/>
at; and all upon a Plea of <hi>Conscience,</hi> it
will concern us, as becomes Men of
Sense, seriously to examine the force of
this Plea; which our Adversaries are still
setting up against us as the Grand
Pillar and Buttress of <hi>the good Old Cause</hi>
of Non-conformity. For, come to any
Dissenting Brother, and ask him, Why
cannot you communicate with the
Church of <hi>England? Oh,</hi> (says he) <hi>it
is against my Conscience; my Conscience will
not suffer me to Pray by a Set-form, to
Kneel at the Sacrament, to hear Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
read by one in a Surplice; or to use the
Cross in Baptism;</hi> or the like.</p>
            <p>Very well; And is this the Case then,
that it is all <hi>pure Conscience</hi> that keeps
you from complying with the Rule and
Order of the Church in these matters?
If so, then produce me some <hi>Word</hi> or
<hi>Law of God</hi> forbidding these things. For
<hi>Conscience</hi> never commands or forbids
any thing Authentically, but there is
some <hi>Law of God,</hi> which commands or
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:107166:310"/>
forbids it first. <hi>Conscience</hi> (as might be
easily shewn) being no distinct Power or
Faculty from the Mind of Man, <hi>but the
Mind of Man it self applying the General
Rule of God's Law to particular Cases and
Actions.</hi> This is truly and properly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
And therefore shew me such a
<hi>Law;</hi> and that, either as a <hi>Necessary
Dictate of Right Reason, or a Positive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
in God's Revealed Word:</hi> (For
these Two are all the Ways, by which
God speaks to Men now-a-days;) I say,
shew me something from hence, which
<hi>countermands,</hi> or <hi>condemns</hi> all or any of
the fore-mentioned <hi>Ceremonies of our
Church,</hi> and then I will yield the Cause.
But if no such <hi>Reason,</hi> no such <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
can be brought to appear in their
behalf against us, but that with <hi>screwed
Face,</hi> and <hi>dolefull Whine,</hi> they only ply
you with senceless Harangues of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
against <hi>carnal Ordinances,</hi> the <hi>Dead
Letter,</hi> and <hi>human Inventions</hi> on the one
hand, and loud Out-cries for a <hi>further
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:107166:310"/>
Reformation</hi> on the other; then rest you
assured, that they have a design upon
your <hi>Pocket,</hi> and that the word <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
is used only as an Instrument to pick
it; and more particularly, as it calls it a <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reformation,</hi> signifies no more, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Church, than as if one man
should come to another and say, <hi>Sir, I have
already taken away your Cloak, and doe fully
intend (if I can) to take away your Coat also.</hi>
This is the true meaning of this word,
<hi>further Reformation;</hi> and so long as you
understand it in this sence, you cannot
be imposed upon by it.</p>
            <p>Well; but if these mighty Men at
<hi>Chapter</hi> and <hi>Verse</hi> can produce you no
Scripture to over-throw our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceremonies,
I will undertake to produce
Scripture enough to warrant them; even
all those places, which <hi>absolutely</hi> enjoyn
Obedience, and Submission to <hi>Lawfull</hi>
Governours in all <hi>not unlawfull Things;</hi>
particularly that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. and
that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. (of which two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:107166:311"/>
more again presently) together with
that other in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. last <hi>verse,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
<hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> in God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and in all things relating to it.
And consequently, till these Men can
prove the <hi>fore-mentioned</hi> Things, ordered
by our Church, to be either intrinsecally
unlawfull, or undecent, I doe here affirm
by the Authority of the foregoing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
That the use of them, as they
stand established amongst us, is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;
and that all Pretences, or Pleas
of Conscience, to the contrary, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Cant</hi> and <hi>Cheat, Flam</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion.</hi>
In a word, the Ceremonies of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> are as necessary,
as the Injunctions of an undoubtedly law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Authority, the Practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, and the General Rules
of Decency, determined to Particulars of
the greatest Decency, can make them
<hi>necessary.</hi> And I would not for all the
World be arraigned at the last and great
Day for disturbing the Church, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:107166:311"/>
Government, and have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Plea for so doing, than what those
of the Separation were ever yet able to
defend themselves by.</p>
            <p>But some will here say perhaps: If
this be all, that you require of us, we
both can, and doe bring you Scripture
against your Church-ceremonies; even
that, which condemns all <hi>Will-worship,
Col.</hi> 2. 23. and such other like places.
To which I answer, first; That the
<hi>Will-worship,</hi> forbidden in that Scripture,
is so termed, not from the <hi>Circumstance,</hi>
but from the <hi>Object</hi> of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
and we readily own, That it is
by no means in the Church's Power to
appoint, or chuse, <hi>whom,</hi> or <hi>what</hi> it will
Worship. But that does not inferr, That
it is not therefore in the Church's Power
to appoint <hi>how, and in what manner it</hi>
will Worship the true Object of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worship; provided, that in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it observes such Rules of Decency,
as are proper, and conducing to that
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:107166:312"/>
purpose. So that this Scripture is wholly
Irrelative to the case before us; and as
impertinently applied to it, as any poor
Text in the <hi>Revelation</hi> was ever applied
to the grave and profound Whimsies of
some Modern Interpreters. But, 2 <hi>dly.</hi>
to this Objection about <hi>Will-worship,</hi> I
answer yet further; That the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
are no <hi>Worship,</hi> nor <hi>part of God's
Worship</hi> at all, nor were ever pretended
so to be; and, if they are not so much
as <hi>Worship,</hi> I am sure, they cannot be
<hi>Will-worship.</hi> But we own them only
for <hi>Circumstances, Modes,</hi> and <hi>Solemn Usa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
by which God's Worship is orderly
and decently performed: I say, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
them not to be <hi>parts of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi>
but, for all that, to be such things
as the Divine Worship, in some Instance
or other, cannot be without: For that,
which neither does, nor can <hi>give vital
Heat,</hi> may yet be necessary to <hi>preserve
it:</hi> And he, who should strip himself
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:107166:312"/>
of all, that is <hi>no part of himself,</hi> would
quickly find, or rather <hi>feel</hi> the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of such a Practice; and have
cause to wish for a Body, as <hi>void of sense,</hi>
as such an Argument.</p>
            <p>Now the Consequence in both these
cases is perfectly Parallel; and if so, you
may rest satisfied; That, what is <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense</hi>
upon a Principle of Reason, will
never be <hi>sense</hi> upon a Principle of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
But as touching the Necessity of
the aforesaid <hi>Usages</hi> in the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
I shall lay down these <hi>four</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Circumstantials</hi> in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God (as well as in all other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Actions) are so necessary to it,
that it cannot possibly be <hi>performed</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them.</p>
            <p>2. That <hi>Decency</hi> in the <hi>Circumstantials</hi>
of God's Worship is absolutely necessary.</p>
            <p>3. That the <hi>General</hi> Rule and Precept
of <hi>Decency</hi> is not capable of being redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to Practice, but as it is exemplified in,
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:107166:313"/>
and determined to <hi>particular Instances.</hi>
And,</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> That there is more
of the <hi>General Nature of Decency</hi> in those
particular <hi>Usages</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which
the Church of <hi>England</hi> has pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than is, or can be shewn in any
other whatsoever.</p>
            <p>These things I affirm; and when you
have put them all together, let any one
give me a solid and sufficient Reason
for the giving up those few Ceremonies
of our Church, if he can. All the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that I could ever yet hear alleaged
by the chief Factors for a General Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of all Sorts, Sects, and Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
into our Communion, is, That those
who separate from us, are stiff and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate,
and will not submit to the Rules
and Orders of our Church, and that
therefore they ought to be taken away.
Which is a goodly <hi>Reason</hi> indeed, and
every way worthy of the Wisdom and
Integrity of those, who alleage it. And
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:107166:313"/>
to shew, that it is so, let it be but trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> to the <hi>Civil
Government,</hi> from <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>State;</hi> and
let all Laws be abrogated, which any
great or sturdy Multitude of Men have
no mind to submit to. That is, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
words, let Laws be made <hi>to obey,</hi>
and not <hi>to be obeyed;</hi> and, upon these
terms, I doubt not but you will find
that Kingdom (or rather that <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>)
finely governed in a short
time.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewn the <hi>Absurdity,
Folly</hi> and <hi>Impertinence</hi> of alleaging the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of Conscience,</hi> where there is no
Law or Command of God mediate or
immediate to found that Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And yet, as bad as this is, it were
well, if the bare <hi>Absurdity</hi> of these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
were the worst thing which we
had to charge them with. But it is not
so. For our second <hi>next Inference</hi> from
the foregoing Principle of the <hi>Vicegerency
of Conscience under God,</hi> will shew <hi>us also</hi>
               <pb n="614" facs="tcp:107166:314"/>
the <hi>daring Impudence,</hi> and <hi>down-right Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety</hi>
of many of those <hi>fulsome</hi> Pleas of
Conscience, which the World has been
too often, and too scandalously abused
by. For a man to sin against his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
is doubtless a great Wickedness.
But to make God himself a Party in the
Sin, is a much greater. For, this is to
plead God's Authority against God's
very Law; which doubles the Sin, and
adds <hi>Blasphemy</hi> to <hi>Rebellion.</hi> And yet
such things we have seen done amongst
us. An horrid, unnatural, Civil War
raised, and carried on; the purest, and
most primitively Reformed Church in
the World laid in the Dust, and one
of the best and most innocent Princes,
that ever sat upon a Throne, by a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
unheard-of Violence hurried to
his Grave in a bloudy Sheet, and not so
much as suffered to rest there to this
day; and all this by Men acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the most solemn Pretences of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
that Hypocrisie perhaps ever yet
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:107166:314"/>
presumed to out-face the World with.</p>
            <p>And are not the <hi>Principles</hi> of those
Wretches still owned, and their <hi>Persons</hi>
Sainted by a Race of Men of the same
stamp, risen up in their stead, the sworn
mortal Enemies of our Church? And
yet, for whose sake, some Projectors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us have been turning every Stone
to transform, mangle and degrade its
noble Constitution to the homely, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick
Model of those <hi>Republican, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Churches abroad.</hi> Which, instead of
being any Rule or Pattern to us, ought
in all Reason to receive one <hi>from</hi> us.
Nay, and so short-sighted are some in
their <hi>Politicks,</hi> as not to discern all this
while, that it is not the <hi>Service,</hi> but the
<hi>Revenue of our Church</hi> which is struck
at; and not any <hi>Passages</hi> of our <hi>Liturgy,</hi>
but the <hi>Property</hi> of our <hi>Lands</hi> which these
Reformers would have <hi>altered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, I am sure, no other <hi>Alteration</hi>
will satisfie <hi>Dissenting Consciences;</hi> no, nor
this neither, very long, without an utter
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:107166:315"/>
Abolition of all that looks like Order
or Government in the Church. And this
we may be sure of, if we doe but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
both the inveterate Malice of the
<hi>Romish Party,</hi> which sets these silly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
Tools a-work, and withall
that monstrous Principle, or Maxim,
which those who divide from us (at
least most of them) <hi>roundly</hi> profess, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow,
and govern their Consciences by.
Namely; <hi>That in all matters that concern
Religion, or the Church, though a Thing or
Action be never so indifferent or lawfull in
it self; yet if it be commanded or enjoyned
by the Government either Civil or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
it becomes</hi> ipso facto, <hi>by being so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
utterly unlawfull, and such as they
can, by no means, with good Conscience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which one detestable <hi>Tenet,</hi> or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
carrying in it the very <hi>Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi>
and <hi>vital Spirit</hi> of all Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
absolutely casheirs and cuts off all
Church Government at one stroke; and
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:107166:315"/>
is withall such an insolent, audacious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
of Almighty God, under the Mask
of <hi>Conscience;</hi> as perhaps none in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages, who so much as wore the
Name of Christians, ever arrived to, or
made profession of.</p>
            <p>For, to resume the Scriptures afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted
by us; and particularly that in
1 <hi>Pet. 2. 13. Submit your selves to every
Ordinance of Man,</hi> says the Spirit of God,
speaking by that Apostle. But say these
Men; If the <hi>Ordinance of Man</hi> enjoyns
you the Practice of any thing with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to <hi>Religion</hi> or the <hi>Church,</hi> (though
never so lawfull in it self,) you cannot
with <hi>a good Conscience submit to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Man in that case:</hi> That is, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
words, God says, <hi>they must submit;</hi>
and they say, <hi>they must not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, in the fore-mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi>
13. 17. The Apostle bids them (and
in them, all Christians whatsoever) <hi>to
obey those who have the Rule over them;</hi>
speaking there of Church-Rulers; for he
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:107166:316"/>
tells them, <hi>That they were such as watched
for their Souls.</hi> But, says the <hi>Separatist,</hi>
If those <hi>who have the Rule over you,</hi> should
command you any thing about <hi>Church
Affairs,</hi> you <hi>cannot,</hi> you <hi>ought</hi> not, in
<hi>Conscience,</hi> to obey them; For as much
as according to that <hi>grand Principle</hi> of
theirs, newly specified by us; Every
such Command makes Obedience to a
thing otherwise lawfull to become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull;
and consequently, upon the
same Principle, <hi>Rulers must not, cannot
be obeyed:</hi> Unless we could imagine, that
there <hi>may be</hi> such a thing as <hi>Obedience</hi> on
the one side, when there <hi>must be</hi> no such
thing as a <hi>Command</hi> on the other; which
would make pleasant sence of it indeed,
and fit for none but a <hi>Dissenting Reason,</hi>
as well as <hi>Conscience,</hi> to assert. For, though
these Men have given the World too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
terrible Proofs by their own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
That there may be <hi>Commands,</hi> and
no <hi>Obedience;</hi> yet, I believe, it will put
their <hi>little Logick</hi> hard to it, to prove,
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:107166:316"/>
That there can be any <hi>Obedience,</hi> where
<hi>there is no Command.</hi> And therefore, it
unanswerably follows, That the Abetters
of the fore-mentioned Principle plead
<hi>Conscience</hi> in a direct and bare-faced
contradiction to God's express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>And now (I beseech you) consider
with your selves (for it is no slight mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that I am treating of;) I say, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what you ought to judge of those
insolent, unaccountable Boasts of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
which, like so many <hi>Fire-balls</hi> or
<hi>Mouth-Granadoes</hi> (as I may so term
them) are every day thrown at our
Church. The Apostle bids us <hi>prove all
Things.</hi> And will you then take Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
at every turn, upon its own
word? upon the forlorn Credit of every
bold Impostor who pleads it? Will you
sell your <hi>Reason,</hi> your <hi>Church,</hi> and your
<hi>Religion,</hi> and both of them the best in
the World, for a <hi>Name?</hi> and that a wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
abused, mis-applied Name? <hi>Knaves,</hi>
               <pb n="620" facs="tcp:107166:317"/>
when they design some more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Villainy, never fail to make use
of this Plea; and it is, because they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
find <hi>fools</hi> ready to believe it.</p>
            <p>But you will say then; What course
must be taken to fence against this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture?
Why truly, the best that I
know of, I have told you before; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That whensoever you hear any of
these fly, sanctified Sycophants, with <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up Eye,</hi> and <hi>shrug of Shoulder,</hi> pleading
<hi>Conscience for</hi> or <hi>against</hi> any Thing, or
Practice, you would forthwith ask them,
<hi>What Word of God they have to bottom that
Iudgment of their Conscience upon?</hi> For-as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as <hi>Conscience,</hi> being <hi>God's Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi>
was never Commissioned by him
to govern us in its own Name; but
must still have some Divine <hi>Word</hi> or
<hi>Law</hi> to support and warrant it. And
therefore call for such a <hi>word;</hi> and that,
either from <hi>Scripture,</hi> or from <hi>manifest
Universal Reason,</hi> and insist upon it, so,
as not to be put off without it. And if
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:107166:317"/>
they can produce you no such thing
from either of them, (as they never
can;) then rest assured, that they are
errant <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> and that,
for all their big Words, the <hi>Conscience</hi> of
such Men is so far from being able to
give them any true <hi>Confidence towards God,</hi>
that it cannot so much as give them
Confidence towards a wise and good
Man, no, nor yet towards themselves,
who are far from being either.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewn you the <hi>First
ground</hi> upon <hi>which the Testimony of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(concerning a man's spiritual Estate)
comes to be so Authentick, and so much to be
relied upon;</hi> to wit, the high Office which
it holds, as <hi>the Vicegerent of God himself</hi>
in the Soul of Man: Together with the
<hi>Two grand Inferences</hi> drawn from thence.
The first of them shewing the <hi>Absurdity,
Folly,</hi> and <hi>Impertinence</hi> of pretending <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
against any Thing, when there is
no Law of God mediate or immediate
against it: And the other setting forth
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:107166:318"/>
the <hi>intolerable Blasphemy and Impiety of</hi>
pretending <hi>Conscience for any Thing,</hi> which
the <hi>known</hi> Law of God is directly <hi>against,</hi>
and stands in open defiance <hi>of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proceed we now to the <hi>second Ground,</hi>
from which <hi>Conscience</hi> derives the Credit
of its Testimony in judging of our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Estate; and that consists in those
<hi>Properties and Qualities which so peculiarly
fit it for the discharge of its fore-mentioned
Office, in all things relating to the Soul.</hi>
And these are Three.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Quickness of its Sight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Tenderness of its Sense:
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> Its Rigorous and
Impartial way of giving Sentence.</p>
            <p>Of each of which in their Order.
And first, For the <hi>Extraordinary quickness
and sagacity of its Sight,</hi> in spying out
every Thing, which can any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Estate of the Soul. As the <hi>Voice</hi>
of it (I shew) was as loud as <hi>Thunder;</hi>
so the <hi>Sight</hi> of it is as piercing and <hi>quick</hi>
               <pb n="623" facs="tcp:107166:318"/>
as Lightning. It presently sees the
Guilt, and looks through all the Flaws,
and Blemishes of a sinfull Action; and
on the other side, observes the Candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Man's very <hi>Principles,</hi> the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of his <hi>Intentions,</hi> and the whole
Carriage of every Circumstance in a
Vertuous performance. So strict, and
accurate is this spiritual Inquisition.</p>
            <p>Upon which Account it is; That
there is no such Thing, as perfect <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie,</hi>
to encourage a rational Mind to
the Perpetration of any base Action.
For a Man must first extinguish, and
put out the <hi>Great Light within him,</hi> his
<hi>Conscience,</hi> he must get away from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and shake off the <hi>Thousand Witnesses,</hi>
which he always carries about him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can be alone. And where there
is no Solitude, I am sure there can be
no Secresie.</p>
            <p>'Tis confessed indeed, that a <hi>Long,</hi> and
a <hi>Bold</hi> Course of Sinning may (as we have
shewn elsewhere) very much dimn, and
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:107166:319"/>
darken the discerning Faculty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
For so the Apostle assures, us, it did
with those in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. and the same no
doubt, it does every Day; but still so, as
to leave such Persons, both then, and now,
many notable <hi>lucid Intervals.</hi> Sufficient to
convince them of their Deviations from
<hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Natural Religion;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to render them <hi>inexcusable;</hi> and so, in
a word, to <hi>stop their Mouths,</hi> though not
<hi>save their Souls.</hi> In <hi>short,</hi> their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was not <hi>stark Dead,</hi> but under a
kind of Spiritual Apoplexy, or <hi>Deliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
The <hi>Operation</hi> was hindred, but the
<hi>Faculty</hi> not destroyed. And now, if
Conscience be naturally thus apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and sagacious; certainly, this ought
to be another great <hi>Ground,</hi> over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
its bare <hi>Authority,</hi> why we should
trust, and rely upon the Reports of it.
For <hi>Knowledge</hi> is still the Ground and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Trust;</hi> and so much as any one
has of Discernment, so far he is secured
from Error and Deception, and for that
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:107166:319"/>
Cause fit to be confided in. No Witness
so much to be credited, as an <hi>Eye-witness.</hi>
And Conscience is like the great Eye of
the World the <hi>Sun,</hi> always open, always
making Discoveries. Justly therefore,
may we by the Light of it take a View
of our <hi>Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> Another <hi>Property</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> of
Conscience, enabling it to judge so truly
of our spiritual Estate, is the <hi>Tenderness
of its Sense.</hi> For as by the <hi>Quickness of
its Sight,</hi> it directs us what <hi>to doe,</hi> or
<hi>not to</hi> doe; so by this <hi>Tenderness of its
Sense, it excuses or accuses us,</hi> as we have
done, or not done, according to those
<hi>Directions.</hi> And it is altogether as nice,
delicate, and tender in <hi>Feeling,</hi> as it can
be perspicacious, and quick <hi>in Seeing.</hi>
For Conscience (you know) is still
called, and accounted the <hi>Eye of the Soul:</hi>
and how troublesome is the least <hi>Mote,</hi>
or Dust falling into the Eye! and how
quickly does it <hi>weep,</hi> and <hi>water</hi> upon the
least Grievance that afflicts it!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="626" facs="tcp:107166:320"/>
And no less exact is the Sense which
Conscience, preserved in its Native Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
has of the least Sin. For, as <hi>great
Sins wast,</hi> so <hi>small ones</hi> are enough to
<hi>wound it;</hi> and every <hi>Wound</hi> (you know)
is painfull; till it festers beyond Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
As soon as ever Sin gives the
Blow, Conscience is the first Thing that
feels the Smart. No sooner does the
<hi>poysoned Arrow</hi> Enter, but that begins to
bleed inwardly. <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
of one, and the Anguish of the
other being Things inseparable.</p>
            <p>Conscience, if truly tender, never
complains without a Cause, though I
confess, there is a new fashioned Sort of
<hi>Tenderness of Conscience,</hi> which always
does so. But that is like the <hi>Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of a Bog or Quagmire, and it is
very dangerous coming near it, for fear
of being swallowed up by it. For
when Conscience has once acquired this
<hi>Artificial Tenderness,</hi> it will strangely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large,
or contract it Swallow as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:107166:320"/>
so that sometimes, a Camel shall
slide down with Ease, where, at other
times, even a Gnat may chance to
stick by the Way. It is, indeed, such a
Kind of <hi>Tenderness,</hi> as makes the Person,
who has it, generally very <hi>tender of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
the Laws,</hi> but never so, of <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</hi> And therefore, since it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
at such Variance with the <hi>Law,</hi>
I think the <hi>Law</hi> is the fittest Thing to
deal with it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let no Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
himself, or think, that <hi>true Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of Conscience</hi> is any Thing else,
but an awfull, and exact Sense of the
<hi>Rule,</hi> which should <hi>direct,</hi> and of the
<hi>Law,</hi> which should <hi>govern</hi> it. And
while it steers by this Compass, and is
sensible of every Declination from it, so
long it is truly and properly <hi>Tender,</hi>
and fit to be relied upon, whether it
checks, or approves a Man, for what he
does. For, from <hi>hence</hi> alone, springs
its <hi>excusing</hi> or <hi>accusing Power.</hi> All accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:107166:321"/>
in the very Nature of the Thing,
still supposing, and being founded upon
<hi>some Law:</hi> For where there is <hi>no Law,</hi>
there can be <hi>no Transgression;</hi> and where
there can be no <hi>Transgression,</hi> I am sure
there ought to be no <hi>Accusation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, when I speak of <hi>Law,</hi> I
mean, both the <hi>Law of God, and of Man</hi>
too. For where the Matter of a Law is
a <hi>Thing not Evil,</hi> every <hi>Law of Man</hi> is
vertually, and at a second Hand, <hi>the
Law of God</hi> also. For as much as it binds
in the strength of the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
Obedience to <hi>Every Ordinance of
Man;</hi> as we have already shewn. And
therefore, all Tenderness of Conscience
against such Laws, is Hypocrisie, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized
by none, but Men of Design,
who look upon it as the fittest Engine
to get into Power by; which, by the
way, when they are once possessed of;
they generally manage with as little <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi>
as they do with <hi>Conscience.</hi> Of
which we have had but too much Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:107166:321"/>
already, and it would be but ill
venturing upon more.</p>
            <p>In a word, <hi>Conscience</hi> not acting by,
and under a <hi>Law,</hi> is a boundless, daring,
and presumptuous thing: and, for any
one by vertue thereof, to challenge to
himself a Privilege of doing what he
will, and of being unaccountable for
what he does, is in all Reason too much,
<hi>either for Man or Angel</hi> to pretend to.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> The third and last <hi>Property of
Conscience</hi> which I shall mention, and
which makes the <hi>Verdict</hi> of it so Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
is its great and rigorous Impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
For, as its wonderfull Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness
made, that it could not easily <hi>be
deceived,</hi> so this makes, that it will by
no means <hi>deceive.</hi> A <hi>Iudge,</hi> you know,
may be skilfull in understanding a Cause,
and yet partial in giving Sentence. But
it is much otherwise with Conscience;
no Artifice can induce it to accuse the
Innocent, or to absolve the Guilty. No;
we may as well bribe the Light and the
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:107166:322"/>
Day to represent White things Black, or
Black White.</p>
            <p>What pitifull things are Power, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
or Riches, when they would <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie,
disswade,</hi> or <hi>buy off</hi> Conscience from
pronouncing Sentence according to the
Merit of a Man's Actions? For still
(as we have shewn) <hi>Conscience is a Copy
of the Divine Law;</hi> and though <hi>Iudges</hi> may
be bribed, or frightened, yet <hi>Laws</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.
The <hi>Law</hi> is Impartial and Inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
it has no Passions or Affections;
and consequently never <hi>accepts Persons,</hi>
nor <hi>dispenses with it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For let the most potent Sinner upon
Earth speak out, and tell us, whether he
can command down the Clamours and
Revilings of a guilty Conscience, and
impose silence upon that bold Reprover.
He may perhaps for a while put on an
high and a big Look; but can he, for
all that, look Conscience out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?
And he may also dissemble a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
forced Jollity, that is, he may Court
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:107166:322"/>
his Mistress, and quaff his Cups, and
perhaps sprinkle them now and then with
a few <hi>Dammees,</hi> but who in the mean
time besides his own wretched miserable
self, knows of those secret, bitter Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which that terrible thing, called
<hi>Conscience</hi> makes into all his Draughts?
Believe it, most of the appearing Mirth
in the World is not <hi>Mirth</hi> but <hi>Art.</hi> The
wounded Spirit is not seen, but walks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a disguise; and still the less you see
of it, the better it looks.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, if we consider the
vertuous Person, let him declare freely,
whether ever his Conscience checked him
for his Innocence, or upbraided him for
an Action of Duty; did it ever bestow
any of its hidden Lashes, or concealed
Bites on a mind severely Pure, Chaste,
and Religious?</p>
            <p>But when Conscience shall <hi>complain,
cry out,</hi> and <hi>recoyl,</hi> let a Man descend
into himself with too just a Suspicion,
that all is not right within. For surely
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:107166:323"/>
that <hi>Hue and cry</hi> was not raised upon him
for nothing. The spoils of a rifled In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
are born away, and the Man
has stoln something from his own Soul;
for which he ought to be pursued, and
will at last certainly be over-took.</p>
            <p>Let every one therefore attend the
Sentence of his Conscience: For he may
be sure, it will not dawb, nor flatter. It is
as severe <hi>as Law;</hi> as impartial <hi>as Truth.</hi>
It will neither conceal, nor pervert what
it knows.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the Third
of those four Particulars at first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and shewn <hi>whence, and upon what
account it is, that the Testimony of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
(concerning our spiritual Estate) comes
to be so Authentick, and so much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
upon:</hi> Namely, For that it is fully
empowered and <hi>commissioned</hi> to this
great Office by God himself; and withall,
that it is extremely <hi>Quick-sighted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and discern;</hi> and moreover very
<hi>Tender and Sensible,</hi> of every thing that
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:107166:323"/>
concerns the Soul. And lastly, That it
is most <hi>exactly and severely Impartial, in
judging</hi> of whatsoever comes before it.
Every one of which Qualifications just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contributes to the Credit and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Sentence which shall be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by it. And so, we are at length
arrived at the <hi>Fourth and last Thing</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
from the words: <hi>Which was to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
some particular Cases, or Instances, in
which this Confidence towards God, suggested
by a rightly informed Conscience, does most
eminently shew, and exert it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall mention Three.</p>
            <p>1. In our Addresses to God <hi>by Prayer.</hi>
When a Man shall presume to come and
place himself in the Presence of the
Great <hi>Searcher of Hearts,</hi> and to ask
something of him, while his Conscience
is all the while smiting him on the
Face, and telling him what a Rebel and
a Traitour he is to the Majesty which he
supplicates; surely such an one should
think with himself, that the God whom
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:107166:324"/>
he prays to, is <hi>greater than his Conscience,</hi>
and pierces into all the filth and baseness
of his Heart with a much clearer, and
more severe Inspection. And if so, will
he not likewise resent the Provocation
more deeply, and revenge it upon him
more terribly, if Repentance does not
divert the Blow? Every such Prayer is
big with Impiety and Contradiction,
and makes as odious a noise in the Ears
of God, as the Harangues of one of
those Rebel Fasts, or Humiliations in the
year <hi>Forty One;</hi> invoking the Blessings of
Heaven upon such Actions and Designs
as nothing but Hell could reward.</p>
            <p>One of the most peculiar Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of an Heart rightly disposed for
Prayer is a well grounded Confidence of
a Man's fitness for that Duty. In <hi>Heb. 10.
22. Let us draw near with a true Heart,
in full assurance of faith,</hi> says the Apostle.
But whence must this Assurance spring?
Why, we are told in the very next
Words of the same Verse: <hi>Having our
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:107166:324"/>
Hearts sprinkled from an evil Conscience:</hi>
Otherwise the voice of an impure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
will cry much louder than our
Prayers, and speak more effectually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, than these can intercede for
us.</p>
            <p>And now, if Prayer be the <hi>great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit
of mercy,</hi> by which the Blessings of
Heaven are derived upon the Creature,
and the noble Instrument of Converse
between God, and the Soul, then surely
that which renders it ineffectual and
loathsome to God, must needs be of the
most mischievous and destructive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to Mankind imaginable: and
consequently to be removed with all that
Earnestness and Concern, with which a
Man would rid himself of a Plague or
a moral Infection. For it taints and
pollutes every Prayer; it turns an <hi>Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
into an <hi>Affront;</hi> and the Odours of
a Sacrifice into the Exhalations of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cass.
And in a word makes the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
over us Brass,</hi> denying all Passage,
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:107166:325"/>
either to <hi>descending Mercies, or ascending Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other side, when a Man's
Breast is clear, and the same Heart
which endites, does also encourage his
Prayer, when his Innocence pushes on
the Attempt, and vouches the Success.
Such an one goes boldly to the Throne
of Grace, and his <hi>Boldness</hi> is not greater
than his <hi>Welcome.</hi> God recognizes the
voice of his own <hi>Spirit</hi> interceding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him; and his Prayers are not only
<hi>followed,</hi> but even <hi>prevented</hi> with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>2ly. <hi>A Second Instance,</hi> in which this
Confidence towards God does so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
shew it self, is at the <hi>Time of
some notable Tryal, or sharp Affliction.</hi>
When a Man's Friends shall desert him,
his Relations disown him, and all
Dependencies fail him, and in a word,
the whole World frown upon him, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it will then be of some moment
to <hi>have a Friend in the Court of Conscience,</hi>
               <pb n="637" facs="tcp:107166:325"/>
which shall (as it were) buoy up his
sinking Spirits, and speak greater Things
for him than all these together can De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
against him.</p>
            <p>For it is most certain, that no Height
of <hi>Honour,</hi> nor affluence of <hi>Fortune</hi> can
keep a Man from being Miserable, nor
indeed Contemptible, when an enraged
Conscience shall fly at him, and take
him by the Throat; so it is also as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that no Temporal Adversities can
cut off those inward, secret, invincible
Supplies of Comfort, which <hi>Conscience</hi>
shall pour in upon distressed Innocence,
in spight, and in defiance of all World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Calamities.</p>
            <p>Naturalists observe, that when the
Frost seizes upon Wine, they are onely
the slighter and more waterish parts of it
that are subject to be congealed; but
still there is a mighty <hi>Spirit,</hi> which can
retreat into <hi>it self,</hi> and there within its
own Compass lie secure from the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
impression of the Element round
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:107166:326"/>
about it. And just so it is with <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of a Man,</hi> while a <hi>good Conscience</hi>
makes it firm and impenetrable. An
outward Affliction can no more benumb
or quell it, than a blast of Wind can
freeze up the Bloud in a Man's Veins, or
a little Showr of Rain soak into his Heart,
and there quench the Principle of Life it
self.</p>
            <p>Take the two greatest Instances of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
which, I think, are incident to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature; to wit, <hi>Poverty,</hi> and
<hi>Shame,</hi> and I dare oppose <hi>Conscience</hi> to
them both.</p>
            <p>And first for <hi>Poverty.</hi> Suppose a
Man stripped of all, driven out of House
and Home, and perhaps out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
too (which having, within our
memory, happened to so many, may
too easily (God knows) be supposed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain)
yet if his Conscience shall tell
him, that it was not for any <hi>failure</hi> in his
own Duty, but from the <hi>success</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Villainy, that all this befell him,
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:107166:326"/>
why then, his Banishment becomes his
Preferment, his Rags his Trophies, his
Nakedness his Ornament; and so long as
his Innocence is his Repast, he feasts and
banquets upon Bread and Water. He
has disarmed his Afflictions, unstung his
Miseries; and though he has not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Happiness of the World, yet he has
the greatest that is to be enjoyed in it.</p>
            <p>And for this, we might appeal to the
Experience of those great, and good
Men, who, in the late Times of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and Confusion, were forced into
foreign Countries, for their unshaken
Firmness, and Fidelity, to the oppressed
Cause of Majesty, and Religion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Conscience did not like a <hi>Fidus
Achates,</hi> still bear them company, stick
close to them, and suggest Comfort, even
when the Causes of Comfort were invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and in a word, verify that great
saying of the Apostle in their Mouths;
<hi>We have nothing, and yet we possess all
Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="640" facs="tcp:107166:327"/>
For it is not barely a Man's Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his External Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which makes him miserable; but
when his Conscience shall hit him in
the Teeth, and tell him, that it was his
Sin, and his Folly, which brought him
under these Abridgements. That his
present scanty Meals are but the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Effects of his former over full ones.
That it was <hi>his Taylor,</hi> and <hi>his Cook,</hi>
his <hi>fine Fashions,</hi> and his <hi>French Ragou's,</hi>
which sequestred him; and, in a word,
that he came by his <hi>Poverty</hi> as sinfully,
as some usually do by their <hi>Riches;</hi>
and consequently, that Providence treats
him with all these Severities, not by
way of Trial, but by way of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Revenge. The Mind surely,
of it self, can feel none of the Burnings
of a Fever; but, if my Fever be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by a Surfeit, and that Surfeit cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by my Sin, it is that which adds Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
to the fiery <hi>Disease, and Rage</hi> to the
Distemper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="641" facs="tcp:107166:327"/>
2<hi>ly.</hi> Let us consider also the Case of
<hi>Calumny, and Disgrace;</hi> Doubtless, the
Sting of every reproachfull Speech, is
the Truth of it; and, <hi>to be conscious,</hi> is
that which gives an Edge, and Keenness
to the Invective. Otherwise, when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
shall <hi>plead not guilty to the Charge,</hi>
a Man entertains it not as an <hi>Endictment,</hi>
but as a <hi>Libel.</hi> He hears all such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
with a generous Unconcernment;
and receiving them at one Ear, gives
them a free and easie Passage through the
other: They fall upon him like Rain,
or Hail upon an oiled Garment; they
may make a Noise indeed, but can find
no Entrance. The very Whispers of an
acquitting Conscience will drown the
Voice of the loudest Slander.</p>
            <p>What a long Charge of Hypocrisie,
and many other base Things, did <hi>Iob's
Friends</hi> draw up against him? But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
it no more, than the <hi>Dunghill
which he sate upon,</hi> while his Conscience
enabled him to appeal, even to God
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:107166:328"/>
Himself; and in Spight of Calumny to
assert, and <hi>hold fast his Integrity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And did not <hi>Ioseph</hi> lie under as black
an Infamy, as the Charge of the highest
Ingratitude, and the lewdest Villainy could
fasten upon him? Yet his Conscience
raised him so much above it, that he
scorned so much as to clear himself, or
to recriminate the Strumpet by a true
Narrative of the Matter. For we read
nothing of that in the whole Story: Such
Confidence, such Greatness of Spirit, does
a <hi>clear Conscience</hi> give a Man; always ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him more solicitous to <hi>preserve
his Innocence,</hi> than concerned to <hi>prove it.</hi>
And so, we come now to the</p>
            <p>3<hi>d.</hi> and <hi>last Instance,</hi> in which above
all others, this <hi>Confidence towards God</hi> does
most eminently shew, and exert it self;
and that is at <hi>the Time of Death.</hi> Which
surely gives the grand Opportunity of
trying both the <hi>Strength,</hi> and <hi>Worth</hi> of
every Principle. When a Man shall be
just about to quit the Stage of this World,
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:107166:328"/>
to put off his Mortality, and to deliver
up his last Accounts to God; at which
sad Time, his Memory shall serve him
for little else, but to terrify him with a
frightfull Review of his past Life, and
his former Extravagances stripped of all
their <hi>Pleasure,</hi> but retaining their <hi>Guilt.</hi>
What is it then, that can promise him a
fair Passage into the other World, or a
comfortable Appearance before his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Judge, when he is there? Not all
the <hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>Interests,</hi> all the <hi>Riches</hi>
and <hi>Honours</hi> under Heaven, can speak
so much as a Word <hi>for him,</hi> or one
Word of Comfort <hi>to him</hi> in that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
they may possibly reproach, but
they cannot relieve him.</p>
            <p>No; at this disconsolate Time, when
the busie Tempter shall be more than
usually apt to vex, and trouble him, and
the Pains of a dying Body to hinder and
discompose him, and the Settlement of
worldly Affairs to disturb, and confound
him; and, in a word, all Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:107166:329"/>
to make his sick Bed grievous, and
uneasie. Nothing can then stand up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all these Ruines, and speak <hi>Life</hi>
in the midst of <hi>Death, but a clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Testimony of that, shall
make the Comforts of Heaven descend
upon his weary Head, like a refreshing
Dew, or Shower upon a parched Ground.
It shall give him some lively Earnests,
and secret Anticipations of his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Joy. It shall bid his Soul go out of
the Body undauntedly, and lift up its
Head with Confidence, before Saints and
Angels. Surely the Comfort, which it
conveys at this Season, is something big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the Capacities of Mortality;
mighty, and unspeakable; and not to
be understood, till it comes to be felt.</p>
            <p>And now, who would not quit all
the <hi>Pleasures,</hi> and <hi>Trash,</hi> and <hi>Trifles,</hi> which
are apt to captivate the Heart of Man,
and pursue the greatest Rigors of Piety,
and Austerities of a good Life to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:107166:329"/>
to himself such a Conscience, as at
the Hour of Death, when all the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
of the World shall bid him <hi>adieu;</hi>
and the whole Creation turn its Back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, shall dismiss his Soul, and close
his Eyes with that blessed Sentence; <hi>Well
done, thou good and faithfull Servant, enter
thou into the Ioy of thy Lord!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For he, whose Conscience enables him
to look God in the Face, <hi>with Confidence</hi>
here, shall be sure to see his Face also, <hi>with
Comfort</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>Which God of his Mercy grant to us all:
To whom be rendred, and ascribed, as
is most due, all Praise, Might, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and Dominion, both now, and
for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
