         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

unto in this buſineſſe, is, to receive
Chriſt into thy heart when he knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at the doore thereof (as he doth
many wayes, but principally by his Word and
Spirit.) For untill then all the ſervice thou offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
him is abominable. Thou mayſt take an
example from thy ſelfe: For when a Friend
whom thou dearly loveſt, knocketh at thy
doore, thou firſt openeſt unto him, and receiveſt
him into thy houſe, cauſeſt him to ſit down, and
then adminiſtreſt unto him: But if thou offer
him any thing at the doore, it is a ſigne he is a
Beggar, and one whom thou rather hireſt by
thy gifts to depart from thee, then inviteſt to
abide with thee. And when Chriſt hath once
poſſeſſion in thy heart, he will purge it of all
corruption and uncleanneſſe; This is that
which <hi>David</hi> ſo much deſired, <hi>Pſam</hi> 51. 10.
<hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God:</hi> And then all
other Chriſtian duties will follow, as the threed
followeth the needle, and Chriſt ſhall ſweetly
ſubject every part and faculty both of ſoul and
body, to a willing obedience of the Goſpel.
And as thou entertaineſt him into thy houſe of
clay; ſo will he entertain thee into his Fathers
Houſe, wherein are many glorious Manſions,
and there thou ſhalt remain with him and the
reſt of his bleſſed Saints and Angels in eternall
joy for ever and ever.</p>

(if thou be not already) a member of the
true Church of Chriſt, of his ſpirituall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which he hath choſen and purchaſed to
himſelfe with the price of his moſt pretious
blood, as his peculiar inheritance, unto whom,
and with whom he hath made his covenant &amp;
promiſe of love, preſence, protection, preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and bleſſing; and upon whom he wil mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
the graces of his holy Spirit abundantly.
This is his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> which his own right hand
hath planted in a fruitful land, with the choiſeſt
vine, and fenced it about for ſafety, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.) from
the wild Boares of the Forreſt, and from <hi>the
little Foxes which deſtroy, Cant.</hi> 2. 15. This is
his <hi>Walled Sheep fold,</hi> in which are incloſed his

of the great God, wherein he is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and his Name called upon, whereof thou
art a Citizen. This is Gods Houſe, of whoſe
Family thou art: which Houſe and City are
built upon a ſure foundation: Of this ſpirituall
Kingdom Chriſt is the only King, Governour,
and law-giver: Take heed therefore that thou
ſubmit not thy ſelfe unto any conſcience-bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
law of Antichriſt his enemy; beare not his
mark neither on thy fore-head, nor in thy hand;
if thou do, thou loſeſt all the former priviledges:
for Chriſt will admit no partner with him in
his govrnment; the <hi>Ark of God</hi> and <hi>Dagon</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand together, nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial.</hi> No
Kingdome ſo ſafe as this, becauſe the Keeper

thou muſt ardently endeavour it. For the holy
deſires of the Saints have alwayes been accepted
of God as the deed; if in the mean time thou

Spirit to mortify the deeds of the fleſh. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and the like, come unto him with that which
thou haſt, and offer it with good will and holy
deſires: For ſo much as thou deſireſt to offer
unto God, ſo great doth he eſteem thy Sacrifice
in his ſight; for he hath given thee no more,
and more then he hath given thee, he will not
require at thy hand: And Chriſt ſhall fulfill
thy lame and imperfect prayers and ſacrifices
with his moſt abſolute &amp; perfect ſacrifice. And
then it cannot be but God ſhall accept thine at
thy hands, as acceptably as he did his Sons: For
herein he doth, as it were, exchange Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rirs

               <p>Be not over-curious in prying into the faults
of others, nor too raſh in cenſuring them: for
though they have not proceeded ſo far as thy
ſelf in the performance of externall duties, yet
they may ſuddenly be converted, and exceed
thee. And though they live in groſſe ſins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
them not, but pitty them and pray for
them, and be thankfull to God who hath called
thee to ſome obedience, who might have left
thee in a worſe eſtate then they are in, if his
grace had not prevented thee. It is oftentimes
ſeen, no greater hypocrites, nor unſound and
hollow-hearted people, then theſe find-faults,
whom our Saviour calls hypocrites, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to caſt the beam out of their owne
eye firſt, that they may the clearer ſee the moat
in anothers. For while thy mind is wandring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to find fault with others, Satan in the
mean time builds a neſt at home in thy heart,
where he hatcheth theſe unclean birds of pride,
hypocriſie, ſelf-love, diſdain of others, &amp;c. which
devour the bleſſed fruits of the Spirit, as humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
meekneſſe, lowlineſſe, brotherly love &amp; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
much hindering the growth of grace in
thee, and diminiſhing ſpiritual comfort, and will
lie heavie upon thy conſcience, when God ſhall
diſcover it unto thee. As therefore thou lookeſt
unto others with one eye, look into thy ſelfe
with the other, leſt thou fall under the reproof of
our Saviour fore-mentioned, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 41. 42.</p>

               <p>If thou wouldſt enjoy the bleſſings of God
either ſpirituall or temporall with comfort, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for peace both in thy ſelf and with others.
For peace is unto all Gods bleſſings as ſalt is to
meat, which ſeaſoneth it in ſuch manner, that it
continueth long both profitable and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
without which it would ſoon become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury
and uſeleſſe. Wherefore the Apoſtles
frequently in their Epiſtles wiſhing all good to
the Churches of Chriſt, mention only <hi>grace and
peace,</hi> including all other bleſſings therein, (as
1 <hi>Pet. 1. 2. Phil. 1. 2. Gal.</hi> 1. 3.) yea, and ſomtimes
no more but the word <hi>peace</hi> alone, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 14.
The want of this bleſsing hath brought this
Kingdom almoſt unto utter ruine, and thouſands
of perſons and families altogether to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both of their bodies and eſtates. If therefore
thou wouldſt enjoy this bleſſing, thou muſt firſt
make account to undergoe much wrong at <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

hands of men, which although it be diſpleaſing
to thy nature, yet it is well-pleaſing to God, and
agreeable to the exhortation of Chriſt, and will
bring much comfort to thy ſoul. Secondly, give
not liberty to thy tongue to revile when thou
art reviled, nor ſcoffe when thou art ſcoffed; for
theſe two vices are commonly the fomenting
inſtruments of all miſchief amongſt friends and
neighbours, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 6. And
when thou ſeeſt two ſtriving to vanquiſh each
other in either of theſe, thou mayſt boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
they contend who ſhall run ſwifteſt to
Hell. Remember then that divine heavenly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat
of the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam. 1. 26. If any man among
you ſeem to bee religious, and bridleth not his
tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is in vain.</hi> And, <hi>Jam. 3. 2. If any man offend
not in word, he is a perfect man, and able to rule
the whole body.</hi>

               <p>The laſt exhortation which I give unto thee
at this time, is, that thou (through covetouſnes)
uſe no fraud, deceit, or guile in thy calling. This
is a ſin as dangerous as common; and becauſe it
brings with it ſome worldly profit, men are
content to live in it, though to the hazard of
their moſt pretious ſouls; yea, even many whom
God hath honored with rare and excellent gifts
of zeal and devotion; as, conſtant in hearing and
reading the word, in prayer and family duties,
and full of heavenly exhortations: yet are as
deeply guilty of this ſin, as thoſe who are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prophane, and never think of anſwering at
the laſt day. And this is lamentable to conſider.
I wiſh all men therefore to remember what
<hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pro. 13. verſ. 11. Wealth gotten
by vanity ſhall be diminiſhed.</hi> And, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 11.
<hi>He that gathereth riches, and not by right, ſhall
leave them in the midst of his dayes, and at his end
ſhall be a fool.</hi> And, <hi>what ſhall it profit thee to win
the whole world, and loſe thy own ſoul?</hi> I would
dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of thee, if thou be <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcientious,</hi> what thou
wilt do with mony falſly gotten? Wilt thou pray
to God to bleſſe it unto thee? Then thou makeſt
him (what in thee lies) partner with thee in thy
cheating &amp; thievery, according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 18.
Wilt thou buy meat or drink with it? Thou
mayſt fear it will either choke or poyſon thee.
Wilt thou buy raiment therwith? Thou mayſt
tremble in putting them on, fearing leſt they
ſhould infect thee with ſome loathſome diſeaſe.
Wilt thou buy houſe or land therewith? It will
never continue to the third generation. Wilt
thou give it the poor? It is no way acceptable to
God, becauſe it is not thine own. Wilt thou put
it among other mony lawfully gotten? It will
be but as a coal of fire in a peece of wax, to melt
and conſume it. Wilt thou caſt it into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
of the Church? It is but as the <hi>hire of a
Whore, or the price of a Dog,</hi> forbidden by <hi>Moſes</hi>
Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 18. Wilt thou caſt it away? That
were a ſin. What wilt thou then doe with it?
Surely <hi>Zacheus</hi> reſolution is the only way, <hi>viz.
(Luk<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

knoweſt not how, or to whom to reſtore it, then
(in my judgement) it properly belongs to the
poore. But, alas! thoſe who are once infected
with this diſeaſe of <hi>Covetouſneſſe,</hi> may fitly be
compared to cloath, which once died black, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
