            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Printer to the Reader.</head>
            <p>WHereas it hath pleased God to hide me (as he did <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Baruch)</hi> on this <note place="margin">Ierm 36. 26</note> side the seas, notwithstanding the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> sent over two men to seeke me (of whom I hard after they were gone hencee) and I doubt not, but the same God will hide me still, untill I haue done his heavenly Maiestie all that servicc which (in his counsell) he hath appoynted me to do here. I am resolved (through his grace) to be as helpfull as (I can) in pulling downe the tower of Babel. Which to do I am perswaded, every chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is as well bound in conscience as to build up the tower of <hi>Sion.</hi> Promising withall, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, to giue over this course, and humbly to submit my selfe to the censure of authority, for the manifesting of my repentance, when I shall learne, that <hi>Diocesan Bishopps</hi> are by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and (as heretofore, so hear after) with all diligence and humility, to informe my selfe, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that question most necessary to be knowne in these times, of all those that esteeme the kingdome of Christ.</p>
            <p>If I be demaunded, whither I haue not heard of, or sene <hi>D. Downams</hi> Sermon at <hi>Lambith: I</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, I heare that many sound divines doe greiue, that so learned a man should discover such weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb facs="tcp:7832:3"/>
But they thinke that the sermon, especially the Epistle was by the instructions of the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> whose chaplaine he is. And <hi>I</hi> see that he doth not answer <hi>M. Iacobs</hi> reasons, though he be carping at his booke: and one other thing of note, which was never yet heard of. viz. That not one Minister of such a perticular congregation, as may, and ought to come togither on the Sabbath, is once named, or specially mentioned, in all the New Testament, but onely <hi>Diocesan</hi> Bishops, from which Bishops those <note place="margin">1 Peter 2. 13 14.</note> Ministers are sent, as governours are sent from the King. So that Mimisters are but curates to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shops, as to those who onely hold their calling im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from <hi>Christ.</hi> Therefore (if this Doctrine be true) me thinkes one prayer in the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Booke should be put out: viz. <hi>Almighty God, who only workest great mervailes, send downe vpon our Bishops and curates the healthfull spirit of thy grace.</hi> For though heretofore it might seeme to us a mervaile, if God blessed Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Ministers as being their curates, because they were not (as yet) knowne to be by Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: yet now (if this doctrine be true, that all having charge of congregations, be either Diocesan Bishops, or their curates) we are not to mervaile if God blesse his owne ordinance. But <hi>I</hi> hope that this doctrine and the whole Sermon, and consequently the vsurpation of <hi>Papall Bishops</hi> will be implea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the barre of their conscience, who haue a
<pb facs="tcp:7832:3"/>
minde to reade: and understanding to iudge what shalbe written.</p>
            <p>In meane while <hi>I</hi> thought it convenient to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>these <hi>Informations,</hi> praying the brethren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> not to be offended, if their be any errors in the <hi>Protestation,</hi> or <hi>Treatise of Kirk governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> but to consider, that <hi>I</hi> received them from <hi>Englishmen,</hi> who haue not (belike) perfect intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Scottish</hi> affaires, but as thinges goe from hand to hand. As may appeare by naming <hi>Leith</hi> to be the place where the Sermon was preached, for which <hi>M. Murray</hi> is imprisoned, notwithstanding the Provinciall Synod, before which it was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched (as <hi>I</hi> heare) approved the same. But that it was preached by <hi>M. Murray</hi> and at <hi>Edinburgh: I</hi> heard not, till after the sermon was imprinted. As for the <hi>Letter,</hi> and <hi>Speach</hi> mentioned in the Title page of this booke, I ioyne them with the other, because they (likewise) informe the Church of the usurpation of Papal Bishops. And the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Letter</hi> doth not onely make good that (which towards the end of the second part of the <hi>Treatise)</hi> is sayd, to this effect: viz That the most learned defendours of the trueth against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Antichrist,</hi> condemne the said usurpation, but also it confuteth sondry pointes of <hi>D. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nams Lambith</hi> Sermon. And secondly. Because the <hi>Letter,</hi> togither with the <hi>Speach</hi> of so worthy a Counsailor of this State, should be some <hi>Incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:7832:4"/>
to his Maiesties most Honorable privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell now being, not to depend upon the mouthes of Bishops and their Chaplaines (who, in this case, are rather to be mistrusted of godly wise men, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabs 400. Prophets</hi> were of King <hi>Iehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi>

               <hi>A</hi> PROTESTATION OFFE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RED <hi>TO THE PARLIAMENT</hi> at <hi>S. Iohnstons</hi> 1. Iulij 1606.</head>
            <p>THe earnest desire of our hearts is to be faithfull, and in case we could haue been silent, and faithfull at this time when the undermined estate of Christ his Kirke craues a dutie at our handes; we should haue locked up our hearts with patience, and our mouthes with taciturnitie rather than to haue <hi>impeshed</hi> any with our admonition. But that quhilk Christ commandeth, necessitie urgeth, and duetie wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of us to be faithful office bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Kirke of God, no man can justly blame us to doe it; Providing we hold our selues within the bounds of that Christian moderation quhilk followeth God without injurie done to any man, specially those, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath lapped up within the skirts of his owne honorable stiles and names, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7832:5"/>
them Gods upon earth.</p>
            <p>Now therfore (my Lords convened in this present Parliament, under the most High &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Majestie of our dread Soveraigne) to your Honors is our exhortation, that yee would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dever with all singlenes of heart, loue, &amp; zeale, to adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the building of the house of God; reserving alwayes into the Lord his owne hands that glorie, quhilk he will communicate neither with man, nor Angell, to wit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe from his holy mountaine a liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <note place="margin">Exod. 25 Hebrew <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, 5</note> patterne according to which his owne Tabernacle, should be formed. Remembring alwayes, that there is no absolute, and unbounded authority in this world, except the Soveraigne authoritie of Christ the King, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it belongeth as properly to rule the <hi>Kirke,</hi> according to the good pleasure of his owne will, as it belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to him to saue his Kirke by the merit of his owne sufferings. All other authoritie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7832:5"/>
is so intre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched within the marches of divine commandement, that the least overpassing of the bounds set by God himselfe bringeth men vnder the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expectation of temporall, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">Heb, 12 25 28, 29.</note> judgmentes. For this cause my Lords, let that authority of your mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in this present Parliament be like the Ocean sea, quhilk as it is greatest of all other waters; so it conteyneth the selfe better within the coasts &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits appoynted by God, than any <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> of fresh ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning waters haue done.</p>
            <p>Next remember that God hath set you to be <hi>Nourish Fathers</hi> of his Kirke, <note place="margin">Isai 49. 23.</note> craving at your hands that you should maintayne and advance by your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie that Church which the Lord hath fashioned by the vncou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfaited worke of his owne newe creation (as the Prophet speaketh) <hi>He hath made us, and not we our selues,</hi> but not that yee <note place="margin">Psalm 100. 3</note> should presume to fashion, and shape a new protrature of a Kirk, and a new
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7832:6"/>
forme of divine service, quhilk Cod in his word hath not before allowed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that were to extend your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity further than the calling yee haue of God doth permit. As namely if ye should (as God forbid) authorize the authority of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and their prehemi nence aboue their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yee should bring into the Kirk of God the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man, and that thing which the experience of preceding ages hath testified to haue been the ground of great idlenes, palpable ignorance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable pride, pitiles tyrannie, and shameles ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the <hi>Kirk</hi> of God. And finally to haue been the ground of that <hi>Antichristian Hicrarchie</hi> which mounted up on the steps of prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of <hi>Bishops</hi> vntil that man of sinn came forth as the ripe fruite of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wisdome, <hi>whom God shall consume with the breath of his owne mouth.</hi> Let the <note place="margin">Thes, 2. 8,</note> sword of God pearce that belly which brought forth such a monster, and let
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7832:6"/>
the staff of God crush that <hi>Egge</hi> which hath hatched such a <hi>Cocatrice.</hi> And let not only that <hi>Roman Antichrist</hi> be thro wen downe from the high Bench of his usurped authoritie, but also let all the steps whereby he mounted up to that unlawfull preheminence be cut downe and utterly abolished in this land.</p>
            <p>Aboue all thinges (my Lords) beware to striue against God with an open &amp; displayed ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner by building vp againe the walles of <hi>Iericho,</hi> quhilk the Lord hath not onely cast downe, but also hath layd them under an horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction and execration: so that the building of them againe must needes stand to greater charges to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, than the reedifiyng of <hi>Iericho,</hi> to <hi>Hiel</hi> the <hi>Bethelit</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Achab.</hi> For he had nothing but the interdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">2.

We beseech your Honours to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this in the ballance of a godly, and prudent minde, and suffer not the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell</hi> to be slandered by the behaviour of a few number of Preachers; of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are bold to affirme, that, ifthey goe forward in this defection, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing and appropriating that name of <hi>Bishops</hi> to themselues only, which is common* to all the Pastors of God his <note place="margin">Act. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. 28.</note>

The matter is of greatest weight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the house of God, which is the <hi>Kirk of the living God.</hi> Therefore <hi>O Lord of light the author of every good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly this supreame Governor <hi>Isai: 9: 6: Christ Iesus;</hi> hath not left his <hi>Kirk</hi> which is his body, mained, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, destitute of right <hi>Covernement, Lawes, &amp; Offices,</hi> needfull for the same, but hath appoynted a certaine Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie heir on earth graced with giftes, an with an calling accordingly, with certaine lawes, limitting their functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and <hi>Gubernation,</hi> and therefore, let no

            <p>Thirdly, this <hi>Gubernation</hi> of the Kirke with <hi>Offices &amp; Functions,</hi> and allpoynts necessary, for accomplishment therof is set downe in the written word of God, the onely square &amp; rule of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine &amp; Discipline, within Christ his Kirke, apt and able to <hi>make the man of God perfect to every good worke.</hi> 2.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7832:14"/>
of the Constitution thereof, we weil say, that the estate of the Kirke of the <hi>New Testament</hi> is inferiour to the estate of the <hi>Kirk</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> quhilk receaved the whole <hi>Ordinancss,</hi> and <hi>Lawes,</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> from the mouth of God, quhilk <hi>Moses</hi> although he was great with God, yet he was but ane Minister. <hi>Num. 12. 7. Heb: 3. 5.</hi> and it was not lawfull to him to alter or change ane pin of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> be himselfe, but as it was sayd to him, <hi>Do althinges according to the forme that thou saw in the Mountaine.</hi> Exo: 25: 40.

            <p>Now let us descend more particularly to learne out of scripture, what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrived anent the Governement and ordering of the <hi>Kirk</hi> heir on earth; For Scripture is the only sure Canon and rule to be followed (as was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) against the which no prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nether of <hi>Angell,</hi> nor of <hi>man</hi> what soever, should prevaile. <hi>Gal. 1. 18.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Vnto these Office-bearers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Christ hath given also a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine limitate power to be exercised by them, according to the word in his <hi>Kirk.</hi> A power severally, <hi>Math: 16. 19. 20. Rom: 12. 3. 6. 7. 8.</hi> and a power joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Paritie</hi> and mutuall consent to be exercised for avoyding of <hi>Tyranny. Math: 18: 17: 18: 19: 20. 1.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Keyes</hi> of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are given joyntly to the Rulers of the Kirke, that whatsoever they bind on earth shalbe bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in heaven; <hi>Math: 18. 18.</hi> This power is not to be used ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7832:20"/>
to their arbitrement and will, but at the will &amp; according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament of him who hath given this power, and hath limited it in his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, presciving the order, usage, and end thereof, <hi>Math: 18. 15. 16. 17. 18. 20.</hi> The order and usage is this, If the offence of thy brother be private, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish him privately between him &amp; thee, with loving admonition with an brotherly care to woone the brother offender. If he refuse to harken unto thee, take two or three brethren with thee for the same purpose; if he weil not harken unto them, shew the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto the Kirke, The care of the Kirke in like manner, is to deale with him, as with ane brother, not to hold him as an enimy, <hi>2. Thes. 3. 15.</hi> but grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and lovingly to admonish, perswad him and to pray for him; to proue if at any time the Lord will giue unto him repentance. <hi>2.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7832:21"/>
can not be drowne unto repentance, then in the name of the Lord Iesus with consent of the Congregation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently and with prayer Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is to be used in casting him out of the Kirk, and giving him over <hi>to Satan for the destruction of the flesh &amp;c.</hi> and is to be holden as ane <hi>Heathen and Publican. &amp;c.</hi> Math: 19: 17. 1. Cor. 5. 4. 5. Thus farr touching private offence. If the fault be publike, the faulter is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likly to be rebooked, and admonished, <hi>1: Tim: 5: 10.</hi> The admonitions alwayes must be done circumspectly, seasoned with truth, gravitie, loue, and peace, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ayming for the safitie of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and notthe destruction. And a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care is to be had of every weake offender, with discretion of offences. <hi>Mat: 18: 15. Gal. 6: 1: 2. 2. Tim: 2. 24. Rom. 14. 13: 19. Iam: 5: 19. 20.</hi> If admonitions prevaile not to drawe him to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to proceid to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as sayd is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:7832:21"/>
If the offender be broght to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, let the repentance &amp; receaving againe to the <hi>Kirk</hi> be according to the proportion of the offence, if the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be publique, the repentance and recep tion publique; if private, private, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes let the repentance be in submis sion without hypocrisie, giving glory unto God. <hi>Math: 18. 15. Luk: 17. 4. 2. Cor. 2. 6. 7.</hi> Moreover, there is given liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power to the rulers of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> to exercise this Christian Discipline according to the necessity of the estate of the Kirke, and according to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currant dangers and diseases in Assem. blies convened together in the name of the Lord Iesus, consisting cheifely, of <hi>Ministers, Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Elders.</hi> Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are <hi>Particular</hi> or <hi>Generall. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> as <hi>Presbyteries</hi> or <hi>Provinciall</hi> Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. <hi>Generall</hi> consisting of on Nation convocat together, for the Common weil, peace, and quietnes of the Kirke. The warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of these Assemblies, with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7832:22"/>
the practise is evident by the word: <hi>Math. 18. 17. 18. 1. Tim. 4. 14. 1. Cor: 5: 4. &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>14: 32. Act: 15: 6: 12. 22. 25.</hi> and hath the practise of Kirkes at all times, and necessities, as sayd is before. This much shortly anent the power, offices and Ministeries in the Kirk Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the Institution of Christ expressed clearely in his word: And all for the edification and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Bodie</hi> of Christ, &amp; for the repayring of the <hi>Sanctes,</hi> to the honor of God by Christ Iesus through all generations for ever. <hi>Eph: 4. 12.</hi> I add hereunto two demonstrations need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full viz. That these offices, &amp; Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as they haue been set downe are perpetuall, and sufficient for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement of the Kirk of Christ.</p>
            <p>The first thus I proue. 1. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth <hi>Timothie</hi> to keep this Governeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and precepts given there anent, <hi>to that glorious comming of the Lord Iesus.</hi> 1. Tim. 3. 21. &amp; 6. 14. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:7832:22"/>
Secondly, all the offices within the Kirk mentioned. <hi>Rom. 12. 6: 7. 8.</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> ver. 4. 5. <hi>1. Cor. 12. 27. 28. 29.</hi> which is the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> of Christ Iesus. <hi>Eph: 1: 22: 23:</hi> et <hi>4: 12.</hi> whereupon followeth this proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the Kirk of Christ quhilk is his <hi>Body</hi> be perfect, and must continue vn to the comming of Christ, these Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; Ministeries must haue the same continuance, except we will say, that Christ his <hi>Body</hi> is imperfect, or mained or the Kirke of Christ shall cease here upon earth, before his comming, qu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilk both are absurd.</p>
            <p>Thridly, if Christ Iesus be only <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of his <hi>Kirk,</hi> which is his kingdome heir on earth, and seeing he must rule and Governe his kingdome unto his comming by his owne offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and by his lawes, by himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute &amp; prescrived in his word. <hi>Rom: 12. 3. 6. 7. 8. 1. Cor.</hi> 12. 28. &amp; <hi>14. 37. Eph.</hi> 4. 8. 11. 12. It followeth that these offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7832:23"/>
and lawes, continue unto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, except we will say, that Christ shall ceasse to be <hi>Governour</hi> of his <hi>Kirk,</hi> and those lawes to be imperfect.</p>
            <p>Ferdly, seeing the object and endes whair about these offices ar occupied, &amp; whairunto they are destinat (quhilk before hath been declared) must haue continuance, therefore, the offices and Ministeries appoynted for those uses &amp; ends must also continue to the end, quhilk necessities no man can avoyde or elude, as for example: There must be heresies, and offences &amp;c: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must be a correcting power in the Kirk <hi>1. Cor. 11. 19.</hi> with offices &amp; ministeries meete for preventing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayning, and expelling the foresayd, or like corruptions.</p>
            <p>As for the Second, to witt that the foresayd offices &amp; Ministeries are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Regiment of Christ his Kirk heir on earth, thus I proue it. 1. If they be not sufficient, then Christ can
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7832:23"/>
not be honored as perfite Governour of his Kirk, neither is his word perfect, but some thing may be added therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which is absurd, <hi>Deut. 4. 2. et 12. 32.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If these be imperfect then man may erect new offices, &amp; add new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries, and giue new giftes and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces accordingly: and if man may add he may also detract; which both are false and absurd. 111. These offices &amp; functions before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, haue gifts and graces needfull, and sufficient, for the discharge of the Ministerie of the word, of the Sacraments, and of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, for the <hi>Edification of the body of Christ &amp;c. Eph: 4: 11: 12.</hi> therefore they must be sufficient. IV. If these offices and Ministeries of the Governement of the Kirke under the Gospell be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient, &amp; imperfect, then the estate of Christ his <hi>Kirke</hi> under the Gospell must be inferior, unto the estate of the Kirke under the law, which had the accomplishment of all offices, ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7832:24"/>
and lawes needfull, and sufficient for the regiment therof, But none will graunt that the estate of the Kirke of Christ is inferior to the estate of the Kirk under the law. Therefore the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayd offices are sufficient, for the Governement of the Kirk of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> And therefore this forme, &amp; order of Government, by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd offices, and Ministeries, of <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> and assisting <hi>Elders,</hi> being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the written word of God, &amp; practise of the <hi>Apostles</hi> &amp; <hi>Kirkes</hi> in their time. <hi>Rom: 12. 6: 7: 8. Eph: 4. 11: 12. Act: 14: 23. et 20. 17. 28. 1. Tim: 5. 17. Tit: 1: 5: &amp;c.</hi> It can admit no prescription: or change by any mortall man, or by any humane tradition whatsoever.</p>

            <p>Atlast, after many overshadowing clouds, the effect and operation of this worke hath broken through the cloud with thunder flacks striking upon god ly, sincere, Teachers of this land. The end of all is: The <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Conformitie</hi> must be set up, and <hi>Kirke Governement</hi> must be turned over into the hands of <hi>Lord Bishops,</hi> supportters of the <hi>Altar</hi> etc: Which kind of <hi>Governement</hi> if it be lawfull, or can stand with the word of God, that we haue to examine in this part.

sufficient, and to haue continuance to the glorious comming of Christ Iesus.

                  <hi>Whatsoevir is contrarie to the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Christ &amp; his wrettin word, is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian, and is to be banished out of the</hi> Kirk <hi>of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Governement by</hi> Lord Bishopps <hi>with Episcopall domination is contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie to the Institution of Christ and his written word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore it is Antichristian, and is to be banishit out of the</hi> Kirk <hi>of God.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>The Proposition can not be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faithfull Christians: the word of God being of absolute perfection, both for substance and Ceremonies: against the which no exception can be made except by Atheists, or Papistes, holding the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> may dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7832:29"/>
with the word, or equalling his tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the word. The controversie therefore staudeth in the <hi>Assumption,</hi> whether the <hi>Governement</hi> of the Kirke apperteineth to <hi>Lord Bishops</hi> or not, &amp; whither to <hi>Lord Bishops</hi> apperteineth a <hi>Lordly Domination?</hi> Quhilk both to be contrary to the word of God, thus we proue.</p>
            <p>The first proufe doth arise from the Examination of the right use of the name <hi>Bishope,</hi> which against the minde of Scripture is abused, making it a na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of speciall office with a speciall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, prerogatiue &amp; Prelacie aboue the rest of the disposers, and Teachers of the word, appropriating unto Bishops Lordship, or <hi>Lordly domination,</hi> making <hi>Prelats</hi> of <hi>Pastors,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Prelats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The name of <hi>Bishop</hi> (EPISCOPOS) signifieth as touching this Argument, ane <hi>Inspector</hi> or <hi>Overseer,</hi> caring for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that are committed to his charge: Qu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilk name is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all <hi>Pastors, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:7832:29"/>
or <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> in the Kirk: As is evident by expresse Scripture in these places following. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> sending for the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Kirk of <hi>Ephesus Act. 20. ver: 17.</hi> And speaking to the same <hi>Elders</hi> he cales the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Bishops. Take heed thersore to your selues, and to all the flocke whairof the holy Ghost hath made you overseers</hi> (EPISCOPOVS) <hi>to feade the Kirke of God. Marke</hi> (faith Ierom) <hi>how calling the Elders of one Citie of</hi> Ephesus, <hi>he intituleth the same men Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner the Apostle <hi>Peter ca. 5. v.</hi> 1. <hi>2.</hi> useth the same word, speaking to the Teachers &amp; Rulers of the <hi>Kirk, Feed the flocke of God</hi> (saith he) <hi>quhilk de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon you caring for it,</hi> or (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the originall) Episcopountes, that is, doing the parte of ane Overseer, or Bishop being common to Pastors, As may further appeare by these places, <hi>Phil: 1. 1. Tit: 1. 5. 7. &amp; 1. Tim:</hi> 3. 1. 2. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quhilk places these conclusions are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily inferred. 1. The name of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chop</hi> being common to Pastors, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7832:30"/>
and Rulers, it is not to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to any one with title power, or prerogatiue aboue the rest.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Here is restrayned the function and charge of these <hi>Overseers</hi> to one flocke over quhilk the Holy Ghost hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them; Therefore presumption it is against the holy Ghost, to a <hi>Bishope</hi> for to claime the charge of many Kirkes, &amp; over many Bishops, or Pastors, and he not resident at one Kirke: as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable abuse and practise is begun in this Realme.</p>
            <p>The Second proufe: The Scripture hath disposed &amp; distributed by Christ his Institution, the Regiment of the Kirk, and offices, and Ministeries ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to Pastors, Doctors, and Elders, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no mention of speciall offices, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, or dignities, of <hi>Papal Bishops,</hi> (so cal led by his <hi>Maiestie Basil: dor: pag 44.)</hi> or <hi>Prelats &amp;c.</hi> Therfore the Regiment of the Kirk, cannot be claimed by <hi>Papal Bishopes</hi> or <hi>Prelates</hi> by Scripture, or by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7832:30"/>
Christ his Institution, and so the usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Papal Bishops and Prelats in the Kirk Governement must be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian. The first part is evident, and cleare deducit in the former parte of this Treatise out of scriptutes, wherein is expressed the Institution of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd offices and Ministeries of Pastors, Doctors, and Elders. Wherupon the other part touching <hi>Papal Bichops</hi> with their titles, dignities, and prerogatiues &amp;c. Hes this cleare inference, that they are not warranted by scripture, as sayd is. For if there were any sick Bishops, or Prelates with office, Titles, power, and dignities aboue the rest, then the scripture would haue set them downe more distinctly, and precisely, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the rest; for the hieer place that one occupieth in the kirk, of the more necessity he is vnto the Kirk, &amp; for this cause the more carefull would Christ (the Head of the <hi>Kirke)</hi> haue bene in poynting him out, and distinguishing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7832:31"/>
him from other.</p>
            <p>We see in the Old Testament, the <hi>High Preist,</hi> his Title, Office, Function, and speciall Administration, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris diction, is more particularly, and pre cisely set downe, than the Office of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the inferior Preists, and Levites.</p>
            <p>And so in the New Testament, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such had bene aboue the rest, their title, power, dignitie, and office more particularly &amp; precisly had ben poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, then of Pastors, Teachers, and Elders &amp;c: But the contrary we see in scripture; wherein the offices, Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and power of Pastors, Teachers, &amp; Elders is clerely set furth. But no sick thing of <hi>Papal, Bishops, Prelats,</hi> and the rest of that order. Therefore can these no wayes stand with scripture.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Quhilk forder is to be cleared by examinyng, and trying the <hi>Titles, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> and <hi>Domination</hi> of <hi>Papal Bischops, Prelates &amp;c:</hi> Who following the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e Antichrist,</hi> claime to themselues a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7832:31"/>
power, <hi>Civill,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall;</hi> quhilk are the <hi>two Hornes of the Secund Beast,</hi> Apoc: 13. 11. As some good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do expond. Quhilk both powers by the devise of Satan, as two swords, haue served the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi> to tread doun, the greatest po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers on earth of <hi>Emperors, Kings,</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> and dayly doth serue for the suppressing of the truth, and faithfull professors of the same. From that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> this mysterie of iniquitie hath flowed to <hi>Cardinals, Arch-bishops,</hi> and the rest of that disordered order &amp;c. Against this injquity, thus we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clud.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whosoever doth participat with the</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist <hi>in usurping a Civil power, and practising the same in the Kirk direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the word, and Institution of Christ, they are of that Antichrist, and there vsurpation Antichristian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Papal Bishops <hi>and</hi> Prelates <hi>in the Kirk vsurps Civil power, directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the word &amp; Institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:7832:32"/>
                  <hi>Therefore so doing they are of that</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, <hi>and their vsurpation</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The proofe of the <hi>Assumption</hi> (quhilk the adversaries deny) is playne be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Scripture, as followeth.</p>

            <head>SIR FRANCIS KNOLLIS <hi>HIS SPEACH IN PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> related by himselfe to the late <hi>worthy Lo: Treasurer Sir</hi> William Cicil.</head>
            <p>To <hi>the end I may informe your Lordship of my dealing in this Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time, a gai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st the undue clai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed superiority of the Bb. over their inferiour brethren. Thus it was:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Because I was in the Parliament, in the 25 yeare of</hi> King Henry <hi>the</hi> 8. <hi>In which time, First all the Cleargie, as well Bishops, as others, made an humble submission to King</hi> Henry 8. <hi>acknowledging his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, and detesting the vsurpation of the Bishop of Romes authority: Vpon which sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mission of the Cleargie the King gaue unto the sayd Bishops, the same ample rule that before they had under the Pope, over their inferiour brethren; saving that the same rule was abridged by statute by this paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis following, that is to say</hi> (without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the prerogatiue Royall of the Crowne of England, and the lawes, &amp;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7832:48"/>
customes of the Realme) <hi>In the latter end of the statute it was added,</hi> That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foever offendeth in any one parte of that statute, and their aiders, counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and abettours, they did all fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the penaltie of the Premunire. <hi>And after I had recited the statute in the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament house, I declared that in</hi> K. Henry 8. <hi>his dayes, after this, there was no Bishop that did practise superiority over their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour brethren. And in King</hi> Edwards <hi>dayes, the sayd Bishops obteyned a statute, whereby they were authorized to keep their Courtes in the Kings name. The which sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was repealed in</hi> Q. Maries <hi>dayes, and is not revived in her Maiesties time that now is: Wherupon it was doubtfull to me, by what authority the Bishops doe keep their Courtes now in their owne names Because it is against the prerogatiue of the Crowne of</hi> England, <hi>that any shou'd keep a Courte without a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t warrant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Crowne. Whereupon I was answered, that the Bishops doe keep their Courtes now by prescription;</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:7832:49"/>
               <hi>and it is true, that the Bishops may prescribe that K:</hi> Henry 8. <hi>gaue them authority, by the Statute of the 25 of his reigne, to haue authority &amp; rule over their inferiour bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as ample as they had in the Popes time: But this was no special warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keep their courts by &amp; that in their owne names. And yet they haue no other warrant to keep their courts (as they do now in their owne names) to my knowledge. And this was the cause that made them obteyne a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in King</hi> Edwards <hi>dayes, to keep their courtes by, in the Kings name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now it is a straunge allegation, that the Bishops should claime authority at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to keep Courtes in their owne names (as they doe) by prescription; Because the statute of 25.</hi> H. 8. <hi>doth restreigne them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally from offending of the prerogatiue royall of the Crowne of</hi> England, <hi>and the lawes and customes of the Realme. And no man may iustly keep a court without a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall warrant from the Crowne of</hi> Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, <hi>as is a foresayd. And the generall liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:7832:49"/>
               <hi>by King</hi> Hen. 8. <hi>to the Bishops to rule and governe, as they did in the Popes time, is no sufficient warrant to the Bishops to keep their Courtes in their owne names by prescription, as I take it. And therefore the Bishops had done wisely, if they had sought a warrant by statute to keep their Courtes in the</hi> Queenes <hi>name, as the Bishops did in king</hi> Edwardes <hi>dayes. In which time</hi> Cranmer <hi>did cause</hi> Peter Martyr, <hi>and</hi> Bucer, <hi>to come over into the Realme to be placed in the two Vniverfities, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instruction of the Vniversities in the word of God. And B:</hi> Cranmer <hi>did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prefer these learned men, without any challenge to himselfe of any superiour rule, in this behalfe over his inferiour brethren. And the time hath been; that no man Could cary away any graunt from the Crowne of</hi> England <hi>by generall wordes; but he must haue speciall wordes to cary the same by. Therefore how the Bishops are warranted to cary away the keeping of their Courts in their owne names by prescription, it passeth</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:7832:50"/>
               <hi>my understanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover, whereas your Lordship sayd vnto me, that the Bishops haue for saken their claime of superiority over their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour brethren (lately) to be by Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, &amp; that (now) they do only claime superioritie from Her Maiestie Supreame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement: if this be true, then it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, and necessary that my L: of</hi> Caunter bury <hi>that now is, do recant, and retract his saying in his booke of the great volume a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> M. Cartwright, <hi>where he saith in playne words (by the name of Doct.</hi> Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift) <hi>That the superiority of Bishopps is Gods owne institution. Which saying doth impugne Her Maiesties supreame government directly, and therefore it is to bere tracted and truely. For</hi> Christ <hi>plainely &amp; truely confesseth,</hi> Ioh: 18. 36. That his kingdom is not of this world. <hi>And ther fore he gaue no worldly rule, or preheminence to his Apostles, but the heavenly rule, which was to Preach the</hi> Gospell, <hi>saying,</hi> Ite, praedicate in omnem mundum;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7832:50"/>
quicunpue crediderit, et baptizatus fuerit, falvus erit: qui non crediderit, condemnabitur. Go, and Preach in all the world; whosoever shall beleiue, &amp; be baptized, shalbe saved: But he that will not beleiue, shall be condemned. Mark 16. 15. 16. <hi>But the Bishops doe crie out saying, That</hi> Cartwright, <hi>and his fel: lowes would haue no Governement, etc. So (belike) the Bishops care for no governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but for worldly, and forcible governement over their brethren, the which</hi> Christ <hi>ne: ver gaue to his Disciples, nor Apostles, but made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> subiect to the rule of Princes, who ought not to be resisted, saving that they might answer unto Princes,</hi> That they must rather obey God, than men. Act. 5. 29. <hi>and yet in no wise to resist the Prince, but to take up the crosse &amp; follow</hi> Christ.</p>

            <p>IF this Honorable man were now aliue, he would wonder more than ever he did, at the resolutenes of our Bishops. In holding their Courtes in their owne names. For bv <hi>M. Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertons</hi> speach; at a committee of both houses,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7832:51"/>
in the second Session of this Parliament it was made so playne, that the Bishops were in the Kings mercy, for having seales of jurisdiction bearing their owne, and not the Kings armes, and holding Courtes in their owne names, and not the Kings, that <hi>S. Iohn Popham</hi> then Lord cheife Iustice of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>S. Edward Cooke</hi> then the Kings Atturney generall, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the same to be true. The reason was this: In the first Session of this Parliament cap. <hi>25.</hi> that Statute of <hi>Q. Mary,</hi> which this worthy Counsailour of State mentioneth, is repealed. By which repeale the Statute of <hi>Edw. 6.</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by him mentioned is restored to life. But more hereof (perhappes) hereafter: In meane while, <hi>Quaere.</hi> Whether those subjectes which haue taken the oath of supremacy be not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworne: If being cited by a processe which hath the seale of a Bishop, &amp; not of the King, they appeare to the Ordinaries Court held in the Bishops name, and not the Kings. Seeing such a processe, and Court so held be (by that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Ed. 6.</hi> now in force) sayd to be against the Kings prerogatiue, &amp; therefore both must be by none other than forreigne power. If so, <hi>Quaere 2.</hi> VVhether his Majesties subiects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so cited to such a Court, be bound (in law) to make their appearance.</p>
