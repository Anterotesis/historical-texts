            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IAm embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by the singular Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worthy Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have been an Admirer of in You, to make choice of Your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be the Patron of the following Discourse.
<pb facs="tcp:93064:3"/>
And the Law of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude commands me like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, to take this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of making a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgment of the many Favours, which, as unworthy as I have been of them, I have received from you.</p>

Onely this I would sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, That since he had not prepared it for the Press, that Accuracy and Exactness ought not to be lookt for in it, which otherwise might be expected: But I doubt not, 'twill have the Approbation of all good men, as a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course well adapted to the Promoting and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of true Piety.

            <epigraph>
               <q>Therefore, my beloved Brethren, be ye Stedfast, Unmoveable, always Abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the work of the Lord, for asmuch as you know that your Labour is not in vain in the Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words are a most just Inference from that great Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truth of another State, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life after the Death of this Body, a reward and blessed Immortality after this present Life; which grand important Truth the Apostle doth assert, largely confirm, and illustrate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93064:5"/>
in this Chapter; and that in opposition to those that denyed the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> or of <hi>any other Life besides this present Life;</hi> as appeared by that wicked Speech of theirs, mentioned in <hi>Vers.</hi> 32. <hi>Let us Eat and Drink, for to Morrow we shall Die;</hi> that is, Let us live in pleasure, be merry and delight our Senses, let us take our fill of the good things of this World; <hi>for to Morrow we Die,</hi> for within a little while we shall be taken out of this World, Death will come 'ere long and seize on us, and then there will be an end of us. This is at large and in very lively expressions described in the <hi>Book of Wisdom,</hi> where wicked Men are brought in speaking out the inward Atheism of their Hearts, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Come on, let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us speedily</hi> (or <hi>earnestly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) use the Creatures like as in Youth. Let us fill our selves with costly Wine and Qyntments; and let no Flower of the Spring pass by us. Let us Crown our selves with Rose-buas before they be withered. Let none of us go without his part of our Voluptuousness</hi> (or <hi>jollity) let us leave Tokens of our joyfulness in every place.</hi> All this is a larger account of that, briefly exprest by the Apostle, <hi>Let us
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93064:5"/>
Eat and Drink.</hi> And as it follows, <hi>for to Morrow we Die;</hi> so upon the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration do these in <hi>Wisd.</hi> 2. encourage themselves to a Sensual Life, <hi>Vers. 1. Our Life is short;</hi> Vers. 5. <hi>Our time is a very shaddow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning.</hi> And the like in <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. 3, 4. But let the Sensual ones, those that are Atheistically dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, talk at this rate, and rejoyce in their Youth; let them walk in the ways of their Hearts, and in the sight of their Eyes; let them mock at the Righteous, and <hi>account his Life Madness, (Wisd.</hi> 5. 4.) They shall one day know, That <hi>verily there is a reward to the Righteous, and doubtless there is a God that judgeth in the Earth; The Righteous shall live for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, their reward is with the Lord, and the care of them is with the most High; they shall receive a Glorious Kingdom and a Beautiful Crown from the Lords Hand, (Wisd.</hi> 5. 15, 16.) or as the Apostle here, <hi>their Labour is not</hi> (shall not be) <hi>in vain in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Words may be easily resolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these Propositions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Christians must be Stedfast, well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93064:6"/>
and rooted in the Faith, Established in the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Christians must be Vnmoveable in the Profession of the Truth, particularly in the Profession of the Faith of the Resurrection and a Life to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Christians must always Abound in the work of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Christians have good ground to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that their Labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> They that abound most in God's work, in the Labours of Religion, may perswade themselves that they shall not lose their Reward, their Labour is not lost, is not fruitless; but shall certainly be rewarded.</p>
            <p>In speaking to which Propositions, we shall not need to seek for Proof else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where then in the Text: For the following Proposition doth fully and pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove the former, as thus. Christians must be <hi>Sted fast,</hi> for else they cannot be <hi>Vnmoveable.</hi> Christians must be both <hi>Stedfast</hi> and <hi>Vnmoveable,</hi> for else they will not, they cannot be <hi>Abounding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the work of the Lord.</hi> Christians must <hi>Abound in the work of the Lord,</hi> for their <hi>Labour will not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93064:8"/>
Structure of Religion was firm and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But the meer outward Profession of the other, the <hi>Foolish</hi> Builder's House, fell immediately when the Rain came, and the Winds blew, and the Floods beat vehemently upon it; <hi>and great was the fall of it;</hi> it made <hi>a great show</hi> while it stood, and it made <hi>as great a noise</hi> when it fell: The fall was the more notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by how much the former Profession was more specious.</p>
               <p>The same Truth [<hi>That we must be Stedfast and well grounded in the Faith, else we cannot be Vnmoveable</hi>] may be Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated from another Similitude, in the Parable of the <hi>Seed and Sower.

Some things he did, and not a small some, yet he was but partial in Obedience; his <hi>Herodias</hi> he would not part with, his <hi>peccata in delicijs;</hi> in some less beloved Sins he would Reform. So they in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31, 32. heard with <hi>gladness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But even these that with <hi>gladness,</hi> with some gust and affection, receive the Word <hi>immediately,</hi> when <hi>Affliction</hi> or

               <p>
                  <hi>They for a while believe,</hi> (saith <hi>Luke Chap.</hi> 8. 13.) <hi>and in time of Temptation fall away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What's the Reason of all? See it in Mark 4. 17. <hi>They have no Root in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so endure but for a time.</hi> They were not rooted, grounded and setled in the Faith; and being not <hi>Stedfast,</hi> they could not be <hi>Vnmoveable.</hi> There may be such <hi>Outward</hi> Christians as may receive the Word immediately with some kind of affection, yet such sudden flashes and motions and appearances of good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not to be trusted to; nor are they from thence to think highly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>See an Example in <hi>Luke 4.</hi> When Christ was Preaching in a Synagogue at <hi>Nazareth</hi> (the place of his Education) <hi>they all in the Synagogue did bear him Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and wondred at the Gracious Words which proceeded out of his Mouth,</hi> Vers. 22. and yet on a sudden, presently after, the same persons, <hi>all they in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, were filled with wrath, and rose up and thrust Christ out of the City, and led him to the brow of the Hill, that they might
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93064:9"/>
cast him Headlong,</hi> Vers. 29. Such an uncertain, slight and inconsiderable a thing is all that affection, that is begot by a slight, superficial and formal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude this, I shall only add, That to be <hi>unmoveable</hi> or <hi>unchangeable, fixed</hi> and <hi>setled,</hi> is not simply and necessarily a praise-worthy quality and disposition, but onely as the matter and object there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, as the things are wherein we are unmoveable. Gal. 4. 18. <hi>It is good to be Zealously affected in all good things.</hi> To turn from Errour to Truth, from Evil to Good, is Vertue and Praise; and an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py change. Whereas to persist, to be stiff and unmoveable in an Opinion and Tenet, after strong Reason to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and all because it has been their Opinion and way, is a fault, and that no small one; it argues a great self-love, self-seeking, and undue affection to their own praise or profit, and a greater regard to their Credit, then to Truth it self.</p>
               <p>Nor is it Vertue or Praise to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable as to all External indifferent things; for the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> himself, for the promoting a greater good, was not so strictly tyed up and confined in his own
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93064:10"/>
Spirit to these lesser things of an indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Nature, but he put himself into all shapes (yet so as to keep from what was sinful) and <hi>became</hi> (as far as lawfully he might) <hi>all things to all Men, that he might by all means' save some,</hi> and win them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Goodness. It was not out of Ambition or Love to the World, but out of a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous regard to the good of others, and that he might be in a capacity, and have the fairer advantages to promote the Interest of Christianity among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that he denyed himself the use of his Christian Liberty, and framed himself to the observance of certain <hi>Mosaical</hi> and <hi>Jewish</hi> Rites, as on the contrary he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himself otherwise among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20.</p>

               <p>Nay further, The sufferings and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships which the better sort of Men meet with in this World, should rather fortifie in them the belief and hope of a Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Glorious Reward, then any way abate it; for <hi>Verily there is a Reward to the Righteous:</hi> If <hi>Lazarus</hi> has evil things here, he shall have his <hi>good things</hi> hereafter, and infinitely better then those good things which <hi>Dives</hi> had here, as the evil things <hi>Lazarus</hi> had here were nothing to the evil (those worse) things that <hi>Dives</hi> was to feel hereafter.</p>

               <p>And therefore there is good Reason for the Apostles advice, That every serious Christian that minds the Salvation of his Soul, would take heed and <hi>flee</hi> such, keep at a distance from Men of such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds, and <hi>beware of the Leaven of the Sadducees.</hi> And if others go a Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after such Doctrines pleasing to Flesh and Blood, if others Apostatize and fall away from the Truth, yet (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks) <hi>do ye beware lest ye be led away with the Errour of the wicked, and fall from your own Stedfastness,</hi> 2 Ep. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>Reason. <hi>Christians must be Stedfast and Vnmoveable in the Belief and Profession of the Truth, those great things of the Christian Faith, the Resurrection and Life to come; Because else they cannot, they will not be always Abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:93064:16"/>
               <p>Clear and strong persuasions of <hi>the Resurrection of the Dead and of a future State,</hi> are a Root and Principle full of sap and lise, and Holiness is the kindly Fruit thereof. Whereas on the contrary, the denial of <hi>the Resurrection and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> is the principle of sin and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and opens the way to all manner of wickedness. They that banish out of their Minds all sense of a future State, will (instead of <hi>abounding in the work of the Lord</hi>) abound in every evil work; all that being taken away which onely is able to lay a powerful restraint upon the unbridled Lusts of Men.</p>
               <p>And here I may Appeal to the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and observation of discerning and serious persons; Let it be considered and observed whether those that can hardly imagine, or cannot conceive any thing but <hi>Body, Flesh</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> those that slight the Notion of <hi>Spirit, Immaterial</hi> and <hi>Immortal Substance;</hi> Whether the Commandments of God are not grievous, and Religion a burden something to them, whether it be not more desireable to them, to be <hi>Epicuri de grege porci,</hi> to wallow in the Mire of sensuality, then to be of Christ's little Flock, to follow Christ in innccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and purity of Life and universal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93064:16"/>
although perhaps some of the more crafty <hi>Epicureans</hi> may have some care to live inoffensively, that so they may keep out of danger of the Laws, and keep up a Reputation in the World for their advantage, and they may abstain from some sins for their Bodies sake, to keep themselves in Life and health.</p>
               <p>Both the Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> and other Apostles (saith S. <hi>Jude</hi> in <hi>Vers.</hi> 17.) did in their Epistles foretel, that <hi>in the last times should come Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, walking after their own Lusts,</hi> (2. Pet. 3. 3.) <hi>after their ungodly Lusts</hi> (so saith <hi>Jude, Vers.</hi> 18.) And what the Apostles did fear and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn of, is come to pass: Such <hi>Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> as these are even to this Day to be found, and where Christianity is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest: But observe the Character of these Men, they are such as have a mind to <hi>walk after their own ungodly Lusts,</hi> such as would not be restrain'd from the forbidden Fruit, such as would gratifie their self-will, and would live as they list; to these Men, the Doctrine of <hi>the Resurrection and Judgment to come,</hi> is very unpleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore they <hi>Scoff</hi> at it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93064:17"/>
and oppose it withal their might.</p>
               <p>But as we are to <hi>shun them, their Principles and their Practices,</hi> so let it be our care to <hi>shun the giving any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or advantage to them.</hi> For know that Men may condemn <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Sadducism</hi> in words, and yet by their Lives and Conversations give great advantage and countenance thereto: Both <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Sadducism</hi>

How are the Modern <hi>Sadducees</hi> and <hi>Epicureans</hi> the more hardned and confirmed in these their Notions, by considering that Men generally <hi>mind Earthly things, their Belly is their God,</hi> they mind and seriously take care for the things on Earth, and do but little relish and set their affections on things above. They see also that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Men (who Profess to believe a future Reward and Punishment) seem not much to be sensible of any Danger to the Soul by Sin, nor much to be affected with the Hellish Misery that is threatned: For most Men are very secure, and manifest but little watchsulness over themselves, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93064:18"/>
little care to break off from Sin, to subdue their Passions, to mortifie their Lusts and inordinate Affections: All which may seem to argue that they do not heartily Believe what they Profess, and that they have no such thoughts of the danger of Sin hereafter, as Men have of the danger to their Life by drinking a Cup of deadly Poyson.</p>
               <p>Nor do they seem to be much Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the future Reward and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities of Heaven, the happiness of another State: For they are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unwilling to leave this present World, and it is very unpleasing to them to think that they must Die. They do not seem to account Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their home and Country, and themselves to be but <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Strangers</hi> in this World: Their hopes of such a Glorious State do not seem so much to enravish and strongly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their Spirits as the hopes of some outward accommodation or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would do, which would tickle, and overjoy them and transport them to excess, when possest: And the hope of obtaining these outward things does engage them to far greater
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93064:18"/>
endeavours then the hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of Heaven, and the Reward to come, do usually put Men upon; which indeed are but slight, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and very cold, if compared with the other, and far from a worthy seeking of <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and as becomes those that believe there is a Glorious Reward there to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Thou therefore that sayst there is a God, dost thou in <hi>works deny him?</hi> Dost thou live <hi>without God in the World?</hi> Dost thou Mis-represent him, and so report of him as to make him like to sinful Men?

               <p>Thou that sayst there is a Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Life to come, a Reward and Punishment, Heaven and Hell: Dost thou so live as one that looks after no other Portion, Consolation and Reward then what is in this Life?

               <p>Nor do they think so worthily as they ought of that future Reward and Glory, that think it so easily attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as by a Death-bed Repentance.</p>
               <p>Nor do they who would seem bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, think so honourably of it, who from some Outward performances in Religion, or some partial obedience, would flatter themselves that they are the Heirs of that Kingdom; whereas their dispositions are wholly unsuiteable to that State, and unfit for converse with <hi>the Spirits of just Men made perfect.</hi> These make that Glorious Reward to come, all that great and rich Prize to be but a mean and cheap thing, who think they shall have it, and win the <hi>Crown,</hi> though they have not <hi>overcome,</hi> and though they do not earnestly <hi>strive for the mastery</hi> over their Lusts and corruptions, and are not <hi>temperate in all things,</hi> nor <hi>keep under their Body and bring it into subjection to the Law of their Mind.</hi> Certainly it would argue more Humility in them, and more Wisdom (as being the safest

course) to think more of Inward Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for that Heavenly State, that their Minds might be purified and wrought into a temper suiteable to it, that they might be made <hi>meet for the Inheritance in Light;</hi> then to flatter themselves into an hope and conceit that such great Glory and Happiness should be cast upon them for some lip-labour in Religion, for outward Sanctimonious shows, for External performances, while in the mean time they so little mind that which is the due and necessary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of their Souls for such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a main Fundamental Truth of the Gospel, and indeed, one of the First Principles of Religion.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Apostle speaks in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3. <hi>I have delivered to you first of all, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> principally,</hi> or as that which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93064:21"/>
is to be counted amongst the first and principle Articles of Christianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God is a Rewarder of those that seek him diligently,</hi> is one of the <hi>First</hi> things to be known and firmly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced (<hi>Heb. 11.</hi>) without which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief all the motions in Religion will be very weak and slow.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>the Joy</hi> be set besore a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, he will then <hi>run with patience</hi> and perseverance <hi>the Race that is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,</hi> and <hi>endure the Cross</hi> (as Christ did, <hi>Hebr. 12.</hi>) and <hi>despise the shame:</hi> As the Apostles <hi>reioyced that they were counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to suffer shame for the Name of Christ,</hi> Acts 5. 41. that is, <hi>for Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Preaching Jesus Christ,</hi> as it is in Vers. 42. <hi>sor Teaching the People, and Preaching through Jesus the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the Dead,</hi> at which the <hi>Sadducees</hi> (being then in Power) <hi>were grieved</hi> (Acts 4. 2.) <hi>and filled with indignation</hi> or <hi>envy,</hi> Chap. 5. 17.</p>
               <p>If there be a Prize to be received at the end of the Race; and this Prize <hi>a Crown of Life and Glory, incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, unfading</hi> (1 Cor. 9. 25. 1 Pet. 1. 4.) not like those corruptible and withering Crowns and Garlands made
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93064:21"/>
of Oaken leaves or Olive-branches, but this made of the leaves of <hi>the Tree of Life</hi> in the Paradise of God; there will then be wrestling and striving, and (the better to prepare and enable for the winning of it) <hi>a being temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in all things, a keeping under of the Body and bringing it into subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> as the Apostle tells the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> who well knew the sitness of those allusions, the <hi>Isthmian</hi> Games being Celebrated here, in that <hi>Isthmus</hi> or Neck of Land on which <hi>Corinth</hi> was Built.</p>
               <p>So great an Insluence and Power hath the due consideration of <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Reward</hi> to the raising and animating of a Christian to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Atcheivements!</p>
               <p>To conclude this particular, we may observe that the Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews (Chap. 6. 1.)</hi> in that short Institution consisting of Six Articles, which Christians were first to be acquainted with, mentions these Two, <hi>viz. The Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Judgment,</hi> when God the Righteous Judge of all the Earth shall dispence Eternal Rewards (<hi>undefiled Rewards,</hi> as the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93064:22"/>
phrase is, <hi>Wisdom. 4. 2.</hi>) to those that Believe and Obey, and Eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to every Soul that doth Evil <hi>Tribulation and Anguish, Indignation and Wrath to them that obey not the Truth, but obey Unrighteousness,</hi> Rom. 2.</p>
               <p>It may be fit also to observe, That this Truth of <hi>the Resurrection and a future State</hi> is called <hi>the Gospel,</hi> 1 Cor. 15 1. and <hi>the Truth,</hi> and <hi>the Faith,</hi> in 1 Tim. 1. where it is said of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> who denyed the Doctrine of <hi>the Resurrection and Life to come,</hi> that <hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, concerning the Faith, of</hi> or <hi>in the Faith, they have made Shipwrack;</hi> and in 2 Ep. chap. 2. it's said of <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> and <hi>Philaetus,</hi> that <hi>they have erred concerning the Truth, (the Faith</hi> and <hi>the Truth,</hi> by way of Eminency) and in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. they are said <hi>to Blaspheme;</hi> and therefore for these their Principles destructive to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to all honesty and godliness, and to a good Conscience the great Apostle <hi>delivered them up to Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing more we may observe, That the Doctrine of <hi>the Resurrection</hi> (as being a Truth of great Importance
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93064:22"/>
and Influence in Christianity) was from the first by Christ himself and his Apostles strongly asserted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest against the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> and against those false Christians that fell from this Truth: And the so early falling away and revolting from this Truth (one of the Truths of Christianity which was so soon and first of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from) was an ill <hi>Omen</hi> and Prognostick of that wickedness which followed after. The Apostles (after Christ was Ascended) took great care to preserve and promote this Truth: And therefore when <hi>Judas</hi> was fallen from his Apostleship, and one was to be chosen into his room; What's the work he was to be chosen to? It is thus described in Acts 1. 22. — <hi>Must one be Ordained to be with us a Witness of his</hi> (that is, of Christ's) <hi>Resurrection;</hi> and not onely of his, but of ours through him. S <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>John Preached through Jesus the Resurrestion from the Dead,</hi> Acts 4. 2. And both these are largely insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and no part of the Christian Faith more largely elsewhere) in 1 Cor. 15. <hi>If there be no Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> if we rise not, <hi>Christ is not Risen:</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:93064:23"/>
And if we Rise, Christ is Risen. <hi>If Christ be not Risen, we are yet in our Sins,</hi> Vers. 17. We may observe also that all the four Evangelists are very particular and full in the History of Christ's Resurrection, upon which ours doth depend.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This great Truth and Doctrine of the Resurrection and Life to come (an hope more then in this Life) is worthy to be embraced, and that we should be Stedfast and Vnmoveable in it, because it is a Truth and Doctrine of sweet and strong Consolation,</hi> full of strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy, the most Soveraign Cordial and Restorative, when our Flesh and Heart may begin to fail through either inward or outward griefs.</p>
               <p>And therefore not without great cause our Saviour Christ repeats this four times in one of his Sermons (John 6.) <hi>I will raise him up at the last Day,</hi> Vers. 39, 40, 44, 54. where it is repeated as being a Truth full of comfort and encouragement.</p>
               <p>And further it is observable, That <hi>the Resurrection,</hi> with the Appendant Glory and Reward in the World to come, is called in Scripture more
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93064:23"/>
then once <hi>The Hope.</hi> Acts 23. 6. saith S. <hi>Paul, Of the Hope and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead I am called in question:</hi> Which words [<hi>of the hope</hi> as being no new, no other thing, are omitted in <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. 21. where that former Speech of his is mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and refer'd to.</p>
               <p>See this also in <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15. and more fully in <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 6, 7. which will clear that in <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 20. <hi>For the hope of Israel</hi> (that is, for asserting the Resurrection) <hi>I am bound with this Chain.</hi> And hence it is, that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>who believe that Jesus died, and rose again,</hi> and that <hi>those who sleep in Jesus</hi> (die in the Lord) <hi>will God bring with him:</hi> they are <hi>not to sorrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them which are asleep, as others which have no hope,</hi> no such knowledge and assurance of a Glorious <hi>Resurrection and Reward to come;</hi> and therefore the Apostle having treated hereof, might well conclude, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Comfort ye one another with these words,</hi> 1 Thes. chap. 4.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 13. are mentioned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>the blessed hope and glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of our Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> which they may look for with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93064:24"/>
who are wrought upon by the Grace of the Gospel to <hi>live Godly, Righteously and Soberly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent World,</hi> as it is in the foregoing words.</p>
               <p>The Primitive Christians thought it the most welcome Morning-Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Lord is risen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> and the other Women that had the first notice by an Angel of <hi>Christ's Resurrection,</hi> it's said, that <hi>they went from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher with great Joy</hi> (Matth. 28. 8.) to tell it to his Disciples <hi>as they Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Wept,</hi> (Mark. 16. 10.)</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Die dayly, Fought with Beasts at Ephesus,</hi> was <hi>in Jeopardy every hour</hi> (as he speaks in 1 Cor. 15.) Now what did comfort and encourage him in all this? It was this, That <hi>the dead should rise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is one famous Instance for the further Illustrating of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which I may not omit; and it is, that of the <hi>Seven Brethren</hi> with their <hi>Mother,</hi> mentioned in 2 <hi>Maccab. Chap.</hi> 7. to which that passage in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 35. doth clearly refer, where it is said, <hi>Others were tortured</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>not accepting deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93064:24"/>
that they might obtain a better Resurrection.</hi> In the Story it is said, that <hi>they were Tormented with Scourges and Whips,</hi> Verse 1. Their Tortures are called <hi>Extreme Tortures,</hi> Vers. 42. (as appears by the description of some of them in <hi>Vers.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 13.) and all this they suffered unto Death at the hands of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> (that Monster of Cruelty) because they would not Transgress the Law in <hi>eating Svines Flesh, Vers.</hi> 1. They might have been delivered, if they had yielded to do it; Nay, <hi>Antiochus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted</hi> the Youngest Brother <hi>with words,</hi> and also <hi>assured him with Oaths,</hi> that if he would yield, <hi>he would make him both a rich and an happy Man, and also take him for his friend, and trust him with Affairs,</hi> Vers. 24. Now what was it that did make them <hi>Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast and Unmoveable</hi> unto the last, what was it that did comfort them in the midst of all their bitter pains, what was it that did animate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them against all the either allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or terrors which the King did try them with? It was clearly this, <hi>The hope and belief of a Resurrection to Everlasting Life after the Death of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93064:25"/>
Body.</hi> And this doth evidently appear by Six Passages in the Story.</p>
               <p>The first is, <hi>the Second Brother's</hi> Speech to <hi>Antiochus</hi> (in Vers. 9.) <hi>Thou like a Fury takest us out of this present Life, but the King of the World shall raise us up, who have died for his Laws, unto Everlasting Life.</hi> And this he is said to speak, <hi>when he was at the last gasp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A second Passage is that Speech of <hi>the Third Brother</hi> (in Vers. 11.) who said <hi>Courageously, These</hi> (meaning the Members of his Body, his <hi>Tongue</hi> and his <hi>Hands,</hi> which he held forth <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> Vers. 10.) <hi>These I had from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and for his Laws I despise them, and from him I hope to receive them again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third Passage is <hi>the Fourth Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's</hi> Speech, which is more full, (in <hi>Vers. 14) It is good, being put to Death by Men, to look for hope from God, to be raised up again: As for thee, thou shalt have no Resurrection to Lise.</hi> And this will explain the Speech of the <hi>Youngest,</hi> which is,</p>
               <p>The fourth Passage (in Vers. 36.) <hi>Our Brethren who now have suffered a short pain, are dead under
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93064:25"/>
God's Covenant of Everlasting Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fifth Passage is the Speech of <hi>the Mother, who was Marvellous above all, and worthy of Honourable Memory;</hi> for being <hi>filled with</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Courageous Spirits, she exhorted every one of her Seven Sons, and stirring up her Womanish Thoughts with a Manly Stomach,</hi> she said unto them (in Vers. 23.) <hi>Doubtless the Creatour of the World, will also of his own Mercy give you Breath and Life again, as you now regard not your own selves for his Laws sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A sixth Passage is her Speech to her <hi>Youngest</hi> Son, who was most of all Tempted by <hi>Antiochus</hi> to accept deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and it was this (in <hi>Vers. 29.) Fear not the Tormentour; but being Worthy of thy Brethren, take thy Death, that I may receive thee again with thy Brethren.</hi> This is part of her Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Speeches to her Sons, and an Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious proof of her great Faith and Hope as to the Life to come; <hi>For when she saw her Seven Sons Slain within the space of one Day,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>she bare it with a good Courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the hope that she had in the Lord;</hi> as it is exprest in <hi>Vers.</hi> 20. and <hi>last
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93064:26"/>
of all, aster the Sons, the Mother Died,</hi> Vers. 41.</p>
               <p>Thus we see by this admirable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance how this Noble Mother and her Sons, rather then Transgress one Commandment of God, forbidding to Tast Swines Flesh, suffer'd the most Exquisite Tortures with a Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Patience, <hi>despised their Bodies,</hi> (Vers. 11.) <hi>regarded not their own selves for his Laws sake,</hi> (Vers. 23.) <hi>offered up their Bodies and Lives for the Laws of their Fathers,</hi> (Vers. 37.) <hi>loved not their Lives to Death</hi> (as it is said of the faithful in <hi>Apocal. 12.) reproched,</hi> or <hi>disdained, disesteemed, their Lives unto Death,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it is said of <hi>Zibulon</hi> and <hi>Napthali,</hi> Judg. 5. 18.) or as it is in Hebr. 11. <hi>would not accept of deliverance,</hi> which was offered to them.</p>
               <p>And that which enabled them thus <hi>to choose rather to die gloriously</hi> was this, <hi>That they might obtain a better Resurrection,</hi> a Resurrection to Life, which <hi>the Fourth Brother</hi> plainly told <hi>Antiochus</hi> that he should not have (<hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 14.) a Resurrection far more acceptable to them then to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their present sufferings, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93064:26"/>
to have their Life prolonged and respited for a while upon Earth upon the terms offered, <hi>to live a little time and a moment longer,</hi> as the phrase is <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 25.</p>
               <p>And the same Spirit of Faith hath no less shined out in the faithful Martyrs of Jesus under the New Testament, who <hi>loved not their Lives unto Death,</hi> (Apocal. 12.) who did <hi>bear in their Bodies the dying of the Lord Jesus</hi> (2 Cor. 4.) <hi>in Weariness and Painfulness, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thirst, in Fastings of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in Cold and Nakedness, in Stripes and Imprisonments,</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) and were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto Death; not accepting of deliverance upon the terms of scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little Incense upon the Altar, or puting a little Incense into the Censors. And all this they suffer'd willingly, as being mindful of that of our Saviour's, <hi>I will raise</hi> thee <hi>up at the last Day</hi> (Jo. 6.) or that in Apocal. 2. 10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider therefore (O faithful Christian) and often consider the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93064:27"/>
great encouragement and <hi>strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,</hi> that it stored up in this Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Doctrine of <hi>the Resurrection and Life to come.</hi> If thy Body lie in a Dungeon, in cold Irons, and perish here; Yet it shall be raised up and sit upon a Throne. If it be Ioden with Chains; it shall hereafter put on Robes of Glory, and be Clothed with the Royal Apparel. What though thou be here (as Christ was) Crowned with Thorns, yet hereafter thou shalt have a better Crown then a Crown of Gold, then the Richest Crown that ever any King or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did wear. What though wicked Men <hi>Eat the Flesh of</hi> Gods <hi>People,</hi> as it is in <hi>Micah.</hi> 3. 3. yet their <hi>Flesh</hi> doth <hi>rest in hope,</hi> Psal. 16.</p>
               <p>To conclude this second Particular, I might observe, That the Doctrine of <hi>Christ's Resurrection</hi> (upon which ours doth depend) is full of the greatest comfort and encouragement: For as he was <hi>delivered</hi> (to death) <hi>for our Offences,</hi> so he <hi>rose again for our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> Rom. 4. 25. His Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did evidence his Death to be an acceptable Sacrifice to God, and availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the making of Atonement and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93064:27"/>
Expiation of our Sins. For had it been otherwise, had not Christ our Surety fully satisfied, had he not done and suffered all that God required at his hand to the making Atonement for our Sins; God would not have <hi>loosed the Bands,</hi> or <hi>Cords of Death,</hi> in raising him up again, but he should have been <hi>holden fast</hi> by Death (<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 24) and still detain'd in the dark Prison of the Grave; he had not been taken up into Heaven, and Seated at God's Right Hand: But his being raised from the Dead, and received up into Glory, and his Interceeding there in the Vertue of his Death, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting his Sacrifice in the behalf of all who truly believe and repent, are evident proofs of the acceptableness of his Sacrifice, and that God was well pleased, and fully satisfied, and that Christ had fulfilled all that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him <hi>to make Reconciliation for Iniquity</hi> (Dan. 9.) The Apostle therefore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. saith, that Christ was <hi>declared</hi> (or <hi>demonstrated</hi>) <hi>to be the Son of God, by the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Dead.</hi> And this (if duly consider'd) makes much for comfort and <hi>strong consolation</hi> unto all sincere
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93064:28"/>
Christians: Hence that of the Apostle (in Rom. 8. 34) <hi>Who is he that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is Risen again, who is even at the Right Hand of God, who also maketh Intercession for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This Doctrine of the Resurrection and Life to come is such as properly and powerfully tends to, and engages a Christian to the greatest Self-purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to all manner of Purity, inward and outward, in Soul and in Body, to <hi>the cleansing of himself from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit;</hi> which is <hi>to perfect Holiness in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. And because it makes so much for the Advancement of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Purity in Heart and Life, it is most worthy to be firmly <hi>Believed</hi> and <hi>Profest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly its said, in 1 John 3. 3. <hi>He that hath this hope</hi> (the hope of <hi>seeing God as he is,</hi> Vers. 2.) <hi>purifies himself even as he is pure:</hi> He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after the greatest <hi>Self-purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as knowing that onely <hi>the pure in Heart shall see God,</hi> who is Purity it self, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> as it is thrice repeated in <hi>Apocal.</hi> 4. 8. but in some Greek Copies Nine times These two
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93064:28"/>
are therefore joyned together [<hi>we shall be like him,</hi> and <hi>we shall see him as he is.</hi> The Soul must first become <hi>like unto God</hi> in Purity and Holiness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is capable of <hi>seeing God as he is,</hi> of enjoying him and having any near and blissful Communion with him. The onely means <hi>to behold the Face of God,</hi> is to behold it <hi>in Righteousness,</hi> and Purity, and Holiness; and such a Christian shall be <hi>satisfied,</hi> when he <hi>awakes</hi> from the sleep of Death, <hi>with God's likeness.</hi> It was to this purpose well observed by <hi>Plotinus,</hi> one of <hi>Origen's</hi> Schollars (in <hi>Ennead. 1. lib. 6.</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Let every one that would see God</hi> (who is Holy, and Pure, and Good, the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Fountain of all Beauty, and Excellency, and Goodness, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) <hi>make account first to become God-like;</hi> his Soul must first be purified as ever he would hope to seé and enjoy God.</p>
               <p>And now as the Soul sets it self in good earnest upon <hi>Self-purification,</hi> as that which is a necessary Preparation for the enjoyment of God; and as it prospers in its sincere and earnest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93064:29"/>
to purge and cleanse it self from all that within which is contrary unto God; by the same degrees and proportion, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (as <hi>Hierocles</hi> to. wards the end of his Comment upon <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Golden Verses, speaks of the great privileges of a Purified Soul) <hi>it revives,</hi> and becomes more lively, active and vivacious, <hi>is more collected within it self, and is filled with Divine Strength and Power:</hi> Now it is that the Locks of <hi>Samson</hi> are grown again (<hi>Judg.</hi> 16.) and the Strength which went and was gone from the Soul by its yielding to the Blandishments and Softnesses of the Sensual and Animal Life (that most dangerous and enveigling <hi>Delilah</hi>) is return'd again: Now it is that the Wings of the Soul grow again and better, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and it moves more freely, being delivered from what did hitherto clog and stop <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> its Heavenly slight and Journey upwards.</p>
               <p>There are some indeed (and they not a few) who seem to acknowledge this Belief and Hope of <hi>the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Life to come,</hi> who yet do only
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93064:29"/>
reach to a slight and superficial Purity, in outward appearance, answerable to their slight and superficial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Grand and Important Truth, such as was that knowledge of the <hi>Pharisees. The Power of Sin within is</hi> stronger and more operative then <hi>the Form of Godliness without;</hi> and be the Form never so Glorious to the Eyes of Men (as the <hi>Pharisaick</hi> Purity was very Specious and taking with the vulgar in our Saviour's time) yet there is little security, no confidence concerning such Men, but that they will shamefully prejudice the Truth and the Religion Professed by them: For they all this while under this disguise do Cherish, and Foment, and make much of <hi>diverse Lusts and Pleasures</hi> (which they <hi>serve, Titus</hi> 3. 3.) and such Sins as are most gainful: These are uncrucified, alive and strong, for they have all <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> made for them (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi>) and are ready to break out when there are Tempting occasions; and hereby <hi>the Name of God is Blasphemed</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24.) and by Christians of this Temper is the Holy Doctrine of the Gospel, <hi>the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93064:30"/>
way of Truth, evil spoken of,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.</p>
               <p>But where there is <hi>the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness within,</hi> there will also be <hi>the Form of Godliness without,</hi> and a better Form then that meer external Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness which the Spiritual <hi>Pharisees</hi> boast of, who would make a <hi>fair shew in the Flesh,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Galat. 6.</hi> When Christians <hi>have Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their Souls in obeying the Truth through the Spirit,</hi> (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks in <hi>1 Ep. Chap. 22.</hi>) there is no doubt but this inward Purity of the Soul will be emproved to the Purity of the Body, the Purity of outward conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. There is the greatest security concerning their ordering the outward conversation aright, whose Hearts are Purified, and where there is a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fountain and Principle of Holiness within: For as the Heart is, so will the words and actions be, <hi>Matth. 12. 35.</hi> It was therefore absolutely the best Counsel and the right Method for <hi>Self-purification,</hi> which our Saviour delivered, <hi>Matth. 23. 26. Cleanse first that which is within, that the out-side may be clean also.</hi> That the Streams be Pure and Chrystalline, it's necessary
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93064:30"/>
that the Spring and Well-head be clear. Purity in Heart is Purity in the Spring, Purity in Actions is Purity in the Streams.</p>
               <p>God requires <hi>Self-purification</hi> as to both; <hi>Clean Hands</hi> and a <hi>Pure Heart,</hi> Psal. 24. 4. The <hi>Cleansing of the Hands</hi> and the <hi>Purifying of the Heart,</hi> Isa. 4. 8. where the <hi>Hands,</hi> as being the most active parts of the Body, and the Instruments most used for action are put for all the Members of the Body, and denote all outward actions which are visible to others, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward visible Course of Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</p>
               <p>And as God requires both <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>Outward Purity,</hi> and the Doctrine of <hi>the Resurrection</hi> obliges a Christian to <hi>the Inward,</hi> so likewise to <hi>the Outward,</hi> that of the Body: He that longs and waites for <hi>the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body</hi> (Rom. 8. 23.) he that hopes for a Glorious and <hi>Spiritual Body,</hi> believing that it shall be raised in Power to such Purity and Glory, must needs infer from hence that it becomes him <hi>to possess his Vessel</hi> (his Body) <hi>in Sanctification and Honour,</hi> and <hi>not in the Lust of Concupiscence,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:93064:31"/>
or <hi>Passion of Lust,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Greek hath it: That so the Body may be in a fit and capable condition of being raised to Eternal Life, an Incorruptible and Heavenly State. And therefore the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> (in 1 Cor. 6.) where he hath many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to perswade to Chastity, and to discountenance Uncleanness, argues from Christs Resurrection and from ours, Vers. 14. <hi>God hath raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own Power.</hi> As we believe and expect that God will raise up our Bodies, and that to an Incorruptible, Spiritual, Pure and Undefiled State, as he rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Body of Christ to such a one, and so <hi>we shall bear the IMage of the Heavenly, the last Adam, the Lord from Heaven</hi> (for <hi>as is the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, such are they also that are Heavenly,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. They shall have such a Body as Christ now hath) it becomes us to keep our Bodies Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and in a State of Purity here on Earth. And in <hi>Vers. 15. Know ye not, that your Bodies are the Members of Christ? Shall I then take the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, and make them the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of an Harlot?

               <p n="4">4. The fourth and last Argument to perswade to a being <hi>Steadfast and Vnmoveable</hi> in the belief of <hi>the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Life to come,</hi> is taken from <hi>the excellent properties and effects of this Doctrine, so adequate to the several needs and exigencies of a Christian here,</hi> and furnishing him with such considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as may be greatly helpful to him in the several Tryals and Exigencies he may meet with in this World.

               <p>But the sober chearfulness and joy (we speak of) arising from the belief of <hi>the Resurrection,</hi> this together with a due Moderation and Equani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, is a safe repast, and is greatly availeable to the health and well being even of the Body in this State, as the Doctrine of <hi>the Resurrection</hi> assures of a better, an Heavenly and Spiritual Body hereafter.</p>

This <hi>Moses refused to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaoh's <hi>Daughter.

and Learning of the <hi>Egyptians, (Philo Jud.</hi> in his <hi>de vitâ Mosis,</hi> saith, she was at great Charges in procuring Men from Forreign Parts to Instruct him.) She <hi>took him for her Son</hi> (Exod. 2. 10. Acts 7. 21.) Intending him to Inherit her Father's Kingdom: She that took him (when an Infant) out of this Ark of Bull-Rushes, where he was laid, would have set him in the Throne, Adopting him for her Son. But <hi>he refused to be called her Son,</hi> and consequently to be the Heir of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; he rejected the offer of a Throne and Kingdom, the hopes of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Dignity upon Earth; and chose the Cross rather then Crown; or if a Crown, he would rather have a Crown of Thorns then a Crown of Gold, he <hi>chose rather to suffer affliction with the People of God, then to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin for a season,</hi> or (to render it more closely to the Greek) <hi>to have the Temporary enjoyment of Sin,</hi>

(as it is described, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 15.) He chose rather to endure the hardships of the Wilderness, then to enjoy the Delicacies and Pleasures of the Court, to live there in all ease and softness, to enjoy the Delights and Sensual sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions which Courts afford, to have Riches, and Honours, and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the great things and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Glory of this World, which others so much scramble for; to have these, and what he would (if <hi>Egypt</hi> could afford it) heaped upon him; all this would have flowed in upon him, if he would have been willing to be Adopted by <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for her Son. And besides his own Personal Worth and Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the unordinary Amiableness of his Person, the Excellency of his Parts emproved by the best Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the singular sweetness of his Spirit (<hi>Meek</hi> and gentle <hi>above all Men upon Earth,</hi> Numb. 12. 3.) would have won and gain'd him all Love and Respects and Venerations, and the good Words and Applause of all; and made him more capable of gratifying and pleasing himself, and emproving the advantages which the Court-life

might afford. But for all this, <hi>he chose rather to suffer affliction with the People of God,</hi> and as it follows in Vers. 26. <hi>He esteemed the reproach of Christ</hi> (for Christ is meant by the <hi>Angel</hi> that did <hi>lead</hi> them and <hi>keep them in the way,</hi> and brought them to <hi>Canaan</hi>) <hi>greater Riches then the Treasures in Egypt,</hi> of which Wealth and Power he had been Possest, had he been content to go for the Son of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daughter.</p>
               <p>But what was it that enabled him to do all this, to deny himself at such a rate as this, that he was worthy to be famed for <hi>the most Self-denying</hi> Man (as he was for the <hi>most Meek</hi> Man) upon Earth? It was his <hi>Faith:</hi> Heb. 11. 24. <hi>By Faith</hi> Moses <hi>when he was come to Tears, refused to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaoh's <hi>Daughter.</hi> He did it not out of Sullenness, or in a Pet or Humour, but deliberately, and upon choice, and upon the best reason and ground, <hi>the hope of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to come;</hi> and it was <hi>Faith</hi> that enabled him to Eye it.</p>
               <p>This is the Account given in Vers. 26. <hi>For he had respect unto the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Reward,</hi>

of better Treasures in Heaven, a better Crown then what <hi>Thermutis</hi> could have helpt him to, a better Kingdom then that in <hi>Egypt;</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of better pleasures, and a more happy condition hereafter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above the Temporary delights of Sin, the pleasures of Sin for a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for a little while in this World, which if he had given up himself to, he had lost those purer and permanent pleasures at Gods Right Hand; The belief of better things that he should be Heir of, if he approved himself as a Son of God, then he could ever be Heir of in <hi>Egypt,</hi> if he were called the Son of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daughter; This was it which enabled him to do all this, and to suffer all the hardships and difficulties he met with, which were not few nor small.</p>

they are ready to take it ill, and to challenge God for not taking due notice of the Honour and Service they do him; and he is not, as they think, so sensible and regardful thereof as he should be, when things go other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with them then they wish.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93064:43"/>
but short, (and as nothing to Eternity) if they be in the Morning of their Age, or in the Afternoon (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed such serious Thoughts as these do more commonly possess those that are in the Afternoon of their Life:) And therefore they rouse up and excite themselves to a greater diligence, Awake, awake, up and be doing, they say unto their Soul; Stir up the gift of God in thee, <hi>be strong in the Grace that is in Christ Jesus:</hi> And show forth that Strength in a Power to do more, and to <hi>endure</hi> more <hi>bard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> as becomes <hi>a good Souldier of Jesus Christ,</hi> (2 Tim. 2.)</p>

               <p>And indeed, the more excellent Christians, such as are more emprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Grace and Spiritual Wisdom, account themselves more obliged to this <hi>Abounding in the Work of the Lord,</hi> from the consideration of what the Apostle intimates in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11. that <hi>our Salvation is now nearer to us then when we believed,</hi> when we were first called and converted to the Faith of Christ; we are now nearer to <hi>the end,</hi> or <hi>reward</hi> of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls; we are nearer to the Coal and end of our Race, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nearer to the Prize of our high Calling in Christ Jesus.

our Neighbour, of doing all the good we can to others, (of which the Apostle speaks in the foregoing Verse) <hi>it is high time to awake out of Sleep,</hi> to shake off all drowsiness, to awake out of a Lazy Profession, to be up and be doing: For we have not long to live in the World, and e're long we shall lay hold on Eternal Life, and receive the Reward far beyond all our Services, infinitely above all our Labours here.</p>

to the good of others; they would Labour more in God's Vineyard, they would <hi>Abound</hi> more <hi>in the Work of the Lord.</hi> They are not over-hasty to receive their Wages, their <hi>Penny</hi> for Labouring in the <hi>Vineyard.</hi> They do not complain of their bearing the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Heat of the Day. They are willing with <hi>Jacob</hi> to serve Seven o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Years for <hi>Rachel.</hi> They are not impatient of the length of the way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor do they murmur that they are kept from tasting the Fruits thereof.

               <p>And now for the verifying of all this that hath been said, we have an evident proof in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> an Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Example of this kind of Self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, who though he was assured of a Better State after his Decease, yet he was content to stay longer for his Reward, he was willing to be absent from the Lord, to be out of Heaven, and to abide longer here; that he might do more Service in the World, and Minister to the good of others: He rather consider'd what was more Needful for Others, then what would be more Gainful for Himself.

World, it is worth the while, it will not be altogether unprofitable to me, nor to others, because thereby I may gain some to Christ; and as for you <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> and other Christians, I may be helpful to you and them, <hi>for your</hi> and their <hi>furtherance and joy of Faith,</hi> (Vers. 25.)</p>
               <p>It follows in the same Verse, <hi>Yet what I shall choose, I wot not</hi>]: There are weighty and pressing Reasons on both sides: so that I know not well whether I should choose and desire to Live or Die, if the choice of both were given me.</p>
               <p>Vers. 23. <hi>For I am in a streight betwixt two</hi>] Here are two different desires, each have their Reasons to move; on the one side,</p>

               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:93064:48"/>
               <p>It follows, <hi>and to be with Christ, which is far better</hi>] Our English Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation is not here so full, and leaves out a word; it is exactly thus, <hi>for this is much better by far,</hi> or <hi>this is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a great deal,</hi>

               <p>And here by the way may be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; That the Soul hath a Being and doth also act, and is capable of joy or pain, and sensible of the good or evil condition she is in, after the Death of the Body; and that therefore she doth not fall into a deep Sleep, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue (as the Body doth) in a sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less condition for many Hundreds, if not Thousands, of Years, till the sounding of the Shrill Trumpet of the Archangel at the great Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Otherwise it had not been <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly much better</hi> for S. <hi>Paul</hi> to depart this Life, but to have lived and continued in the Flesh till the coming of that great Day; S. <hi>Paul</hi> had not been in a strait between two, nor at a loss whether to choose, but he would easily have preferr'd it as more desireable to be awake and alive here to the Service of Christ, and to the endeavouring the good of others;

To act for God in the World, and to be sensible of that satisfaction, and to reap that joy and pleasure which would follow (and did flow into his Soul) upon such labouring and <hi>abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the work of the Lord,</hi> being plainly more eligible and a better State; And to fall asleep, which is to be in a condition of doing nothing for Christ, and of being uncapable of that joy and pleasure which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the doing of good, being as plainly a worse Estate. If to be with Christ, be to fall asleep, to do nothing, to feel nothing, not to be sensible of his being there, it were better for him to be from Christ; and to be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string to the good of others in the World; considering also that it was so needful for the <hi>Philippians</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that he should abide in the Flesh: To live and to act, and to enjoy the comfort of such acting being simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly better, then for the Soul to Sleep, that is, to do nothing, to perceive nothing, which is all one for the time as if the Soul were really Dead, or did Sleep the Sleep of Death.</p>
               <p>And whereas some (as <hi>Grotius</hi> and others) understand no more by this
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93064:49"/>
Phrase [<hi>To be with Christ</hi>] then this, to be <hi>in Christi custodiâ quoad parten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiorem,</hi> i. e. <hi>animam,</hi> to be received by Christ into safe custody, to be committed to his trust and keeping; I Answer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That so the Faithful were in this Life kept by him and by God, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. 11, 12. and <hi>Chap</hi> 10. 28, 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which implys a safe custody, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 19. which plainly is meant of this Life; and therefore if this be meant by <hi>being with Christ,</hi> they might be said <hi>to be with Christ</hi> here, in this Sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That though the Souls of the faithful be after Death received into Christ's custody and keeping, yet this doth not imply nor infer their falling into a senseless, unactive, dead Sleep. In <hi>Jo.</hi> 12. 26. Christ promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to every one that serves him and follows him, <hi>where I am, there shall also my Servant be;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>him will my Father Honour,</hi> that is reward, so the Greek word imports. So that <hi>the being where Christ is</hi> [or <hi>the being with him</hi>] and God's Rewarding, go together. When S. <hi>Stephen</hi> at his Death said, <hi>Lord Jesus rceive my
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93064:50"/>
Spirit,</hi> this doth no more prove that his Spirit fell asleep, as soon as it was received by Christ into his custody, then that the Spirit or Soul of Christ was asleep for three Days, after his Death, immediately before which he said, <hi>Father, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit,</hi> Luke 23. 46.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I add, That this Phrase [<hi>To be with Christ</hi>] doth in the Style of the Scripture imply a State of Life and Sense; not a senseless Sleep, but such a State wherein the Faithful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Christ, and perceive the good of being with him: As appears by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring several passages of Scripture. Thus in <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. 24. It is joyned with their <hi>beholding the Glory which God hath given him.</hi> And it is made use of by Christ as an, Argument to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his troubled Disciples, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14 3. and by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to comfort Christians when grieved for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease of friends, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 17. Where, <hi>to be for ever with the Lord,</hi> that is with Christ, is more then to be taken into his custody, and is far from signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>for ever to be asleep.</hi> In all these places it signifies a State of Activity and Sense, and Perception, and a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93064:50"/>
of that Joy and Happiness, which being considered should fortifie Christians against all trouble and Sorrow. And so <hi>to be with Christ,</hi> is the same with <hi>to live with Christ,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 11. and <hi>to reign with Christ,</hi> Vers. 12.</p>
               <p>And although their <hi>being with Christ,</hi> after they have received their <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Body</hi> at the Resurrection, doth signifie a greater degree of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and a fuller measure of Reward, of which they are now more capable by reason of their Spiritual Body: Yet their <hi>being with Christ</hi> in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate space, between their Death and the Resurrection or last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is far from signifying nothing at all, no lesser degree of Happiness, no enjoyment of Christ, no comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and joyous Perception of their being with him, nothing but a being kept safe or kept in being, nothing but being in a Dead Sleep in his Arms.</p>
               <p>But to return to the rest of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</p>
               <p>Vers. 24. <hi>Nevertheless,</hi> or <hi>but, to abide in the Flesh is more needful for you</hi>] Though it would be more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93064:51"/>
and gainful to me to Die, to go home and to be with Christ; Yet it is more for the advantage of you <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> and of others, that I should live and continue longer in this World.</p>
               <p>And thus we see how S. <hi>Paul</hi> was plainly divided between two desires; the one of his own happiness, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his Father's House and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Christ; the other of his doing good to others; and he inclines at last rather to this latter: Upon this score, of being in a capacity to do good to others, he is inclined to live; as appears by the following Verse, where he expresseth his hope (which argued his desire) that he should <hi>abide</hi> and <hi>continue</hi> with them, live a while longer, for their <hi>furtherance and joy of Faith.</hi> He is willing to stay for his reward, he is content to be absent from Christ, to have his more immediate and blissful enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him deser'd, he is willing to be out of Heaven, that he may do the more good upon Earth; content to be less happy for the present, that he may be the more serviceable in the World. He would not so soon be at
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93064:51"/>
rest from his labours; though his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the World was likely to bring him more suffering and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships: He was now at <hi>Rome,</hi> a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner for Christ, and in the days of <hi>Nero,</hi> that <hi>Lion</hi> (as he calls him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4) and he never stir'd out of his hired House there, but with a Souldier which held him fast to him by an Iron Chain (of which he speaks <hi>Acts</hi> 28.) and therefore it were far better for him, and especially in these Circumstances, to be with Christ, <hi>the Lamb,</hi> who is said (in <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 17.) to <hi>feed</hi> those that are his, and <hi>lead them unto Living Fountains of Water,</hi> so that they shall <hi>neither Hunger nor Thirst any more;</hi> Yet he is willing to stay at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to await the fury of <hi>the Lion,</hi> that Monster of Raging Cruelty, <hi>Nero;</hi> before whom he was brought once at least, and he was <hi>delivered out of the Mouth of the Lion,</hi> (2 Tim. 4. 17.) Good <hi>stood with him</hi> and <hi>strengthened him,</hi> when he stood at the Bar before the Emperour, and delivered him, and to this end (as it follows in that Verse) <hi>that by me the Preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:93064:52"/>
(might receive the Gospel) and there were even in <hi>Caesar's</hi> Houshold those that received the Gospel (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.) Christ had a Flock near the Lions Den, a Church in <hi>Nero's</hi> House. This was that which was most in S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Eye, for this he valued his deliverance, and the preservation and continuance of his Life (as we observed before) And that according to his hope and confidence mention'd to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> of his coming again to them, he was delivered and restored at his first being at <hi>Rome,</hi> is proved by some Writers.</p>
               <p>In a word, Though it were more for his ease to be freed from his <hi>Chain</hi> and his <hi>Bonds in</hi> (or <hi>for</hi>) <hi>Christ,</hi> which (he saith Phil. 1. 13.) <hi>were manifest in</hi> Caesar's <hi>Court;</hi> as well as to be freed from the Bonds and Fetters wherewith his Soul was encompast, while it was in the Prison of this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Body; Though it were more for his advantage to move in the free Air and spacious Regions of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Bliss; Yet he chooseth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wear these <hi>Chains</hi> and <hi>Bonds;</hi> and to wear this great Fetter of the Body, then to wear that Royal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93064:52"/>
with which the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will Invest those whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to Honour, and to partake of that. <hi>Glorious Liberty of the Children of God</hi> in Heaven (that I may borrow that Phrase in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.) He chooses rather to continue in the number of those who <hi>groan in this Earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternacle,</hi> being burdened, then to Sing joyful Hallelujahs in the <hi>Jerusalem which is above and is free</hi> (Gal. 4.) And it was his Love to the good of Souls, his Zeal for the being more Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the Service and Honour of Christ, that was a stronger Chain to hold him here: This was his great business while he was at <hi>Rome</hi> in Chains, <hi>to Preach the Kingdom of God, and to Teach those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> Acts 28. 31. He calls his <hi>Philippians</hi> (in Chap. 4. 1.) <hi>his Joy and Crown;</hi> and that he might for some time longer abide in the Flesh for their <hi>furtherance</hi> in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, he is willing to be without <hi>the Crown of Life</hi> reserved for him in God's Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And was not this a rare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable peice of <hi>Self-denyal</hi> in him? And it will appear the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93064:53"/>
if we consider that S. <hi>Paul</hi> had been rapt up into <hi>the Third Heaven,</hi> he had been caught up into <hi>Paradise,</hi> and there had <hi>heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawsul,</hi> or <hi>possible,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>for a Man to utter;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently he knew more of the Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites and Glories of that Place and State.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Second instance of the <hi>Self-denyal</hi> of the more excellent Christians is this. Though they are Sensible of the inward delights and sweetnesse<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which accompany a <hi>Contemplative Life,</hi> and are enjoy'd by a Soul with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing it self from the noise and cares of the World; Though they are sensible what an Heaven it is upon Earth to have more inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and in great still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and quietness of Spirit to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Divine Excellencies and Perfections, as also to Contemplate the Divine favours and kindnesses, which he hath already bestowed on them, with the much more that he reserves in Heaven, and designs there to bless them with; And though by such Contemplation of the Divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93064:53"/>
and Favours, though by such a seeing of God and tasting how good the Lord is, they are melted into Love, and ravisht into Holy Joys; And though in this deep silence of the Soul they hear the still Voice of the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, speaking Peace and Love unto them: Yet they are willing to abate of those Spiritual Satisfactions and Delights in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God (which are to them far better) that so they may bestow themselves upon Services and Labours for the good of Others (which are to those others more needful.) They are willing to abate of the sweetness of <hi>Contemplation,</hi> that they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves more to <hi>Action;</hi> they account it the greatest Charity to abound in the Works of the <hi>Active</hi> Life, and prefer the Advantages which thereby may come to Others, before the Contentments which might come to Themselves by a Life more <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When S <hi>Peter</hi> with the two other Disciples saw Christ Transfigured on the Mount, together with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who appeared in Glory; he was so Transported and Enravished with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93064:54"/>
this Glorious sight, (this Model os Heaven upon the Mount) that he said, <hi>Lord, it is good for us to be here, let us make Three Tabernacles, one for thee, one for</hi> Moses, <hi>and one for</hi> Elias: He wisht that he might always stay upon the Mount, and was loth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to converse with those below; though in saying this, <hi>he knew not what he said,</hi> Luke 9.</p>
               <p>But the more Excellent Christians though when they are retired and upon the Mount of <hi>Contemplation,</hi> they sometimes see Christ Transfigured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, though they see him in his Glory and Beauty, and are Enravished hereby with Love and Delight, and could ever dwell on the Mount: Yet they do not talk of Building Tabernacles there; They are willing to Descend to those in the Valley, to converse with the meanest and lowest in order to their Spiritual good. And though they gain a more Divine Splendor by such <hi>Contemplations,</hi> and are raised up to more Spiritual Heights and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments (as <hi>Moses</hi> his Face did shine by being with God on the Mount) yet they are ready to put a Vail over their Face, and <hi>to the Weak
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93064:54"/>
they will become as Weak, that they may gain the Weak;</hi> They are willing <hi>to make themselves Servants unto all, that they may gain the more,</hi> as the great Apostle speaks of himself in <hi>1 Cor. 9.</hi> They consider that they are not to please themselves, but <hi>to please their Neighbour</hi> (every other) <hi>for his good to Edification,</hi> Rom. 15.</p>
               <p>It's more pleasing to God that, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then spend most of thy time in silent affectionate <hi>Contemplation</hi> of him, thou shouldst earnestly apply thy self to the Works and Labours of Love for the good of others; which are proper to the <hi>Active</hi> Life: And that thou shouldst testifie and express thy Love to him in Loving thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who more needs the effects of thy Charity, then God doth thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sections and praises, and without loving of whom God doth not account that thou lovest him, as we read in <hi>1 John 4.</hi> where its also said, <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> That <hi>God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> And the more there is of this Hearty Good-will, and endeavours for the good of Others, the more of this enlarged Benignity and Love to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93064:55"/>
Mankind; the more is <hi>the Love of God perfected in us,</hi> Vers. 12. the more shall we have of Gods peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, his <hi>Shechinah</hi> is in such Souls, he <hi>dwells</hi> in them, he <hi>makes his abode</hi> with them, and will <hi>Manifest himself</hi> unto them.</p>
               <p>There is a Season for all things; The <hi>Contemplative</hi> Life is Beautiful in its Season, and so is the <hi>Active</hi> Life in its Season: And <hi>Contemplation</hi> should the more engage, and enable us to <hi>Action.</hi> The more we fix our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Eye upon the Divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, the more we Adore and Love him, the more we consider his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Benignity towards all his Works, and in particular his Mercies to us; the fitter we are to speak of his Glory, and the more should our Love of God awaken and excite us to endeavour the Spiritual good of others, that they also may Adore and Admire, and Love, and Praise Him <hi>who is Worthy to be Praised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is great need of observing fit Seasons for Religious Retirement, and withdrawing thy self from the noise and busie cares of this World: But this is more or less to be used, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93064:55"/>
as the State of thy Soul requires it, and as Christian Prudence shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. Thou art not to dwell upon the Mount, this is but one part of thy Duty; it must be done, but there are other Duties which must not be left undone; which though not so sweet to thee as the other, yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thee to mind them; and by minding them thou mayst do more good in the World, and consequently glorifie God more. Thou art not onely to consider what is comfortable to thy self, but what is profitable to others, to thy Family, to the Church or Common-wealth thou livest in.</p>
               <p>It was a fault in the <hi>Euchite</hi> (a sort of mistaken and unskilful Christians of Old) to account themselves obliged to Pray without ceasing: Whereas God would rather that they should have been up and doing; and instead of being so much on their Knees, their <hi>Feet</hi> should have been <hi>Swift</hi> to Charity, to procure the good of others, as its said of the <hi>Feet</hi> of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, <hi>they are Swift to shed Blood,</hi> (Rom. 3.)</p>
               <p>To conclude, The best Example for our direction in this kind is the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93064:56"/>
Life of Christ. He was for <hi>the mixt Life,</hi> the Life both <hi>Contemplative</hi> and <hi>Active.</hi> As S. <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>He went about doing good,</hi> and his Life was full of action, full of the effects and proofs of his good Will towards Men, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to their Souls and Bodies: So also at Seasons which seemed most fit to him, he would send away the Multitudes, and withdraw himself from his Disciples, and retire into <hi>the Wilderness,</hi> to Pray (<hi>Luke</hi> 5. 16.) or to <hi>a Mountain,</hi> Luke 6. 12. where it is said <hi>he continued all Night in Prayer to God;</hi> And that the <hi>Mount of Olives</hi> was a place he made Use of for the Ascending of his Heart in Prayer to God, as it was made choice of by him for the place whence he would Ascend to Heaven, appears by <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 37. where it is said, that <hi>in the Day-time he was Teaching in the Temple, and at Night he went out and abode in the Mount of Olives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much for the Second sort of <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> which is a lesser Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal then the other, in that this Foretast of Heaven, this Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, in Communion with God here, is less then the Enjoyment of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93064:56"/>
God hereafter, then those larger tastes of <hi>the River of Life, the River of Pleasures, the Fulness of Joy</hi> in that greater Heaven above.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third instance of their <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal</hi> is their disvaluing of their own Services and Labours (of which I spake before) and their looking up to God for the encrease and blessing. Though they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>God's fellow Labourers,</hi> (1 Cor. 3. 9.) yet they acknowledge with S. <hi>Paul</hi> (Vers. 7.) that <hi>neither is he that Planteth any thing, neither is he that Watereth:</hi> Nothing is to be attributed to either; but all the Praise is to be ascribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. So far are they from the the Vanity of <hi>Theudas,</hi> who <hi>boasted himself to be some body</hi> (Acts 5. 36.) or of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who <hi>gave out that himself was some great one</hi> (Acts 8. 9.) But rather are they the followers of the Humility of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted himself <hi>nothing,</hi> though he was <hi>in nothing behind the very Chiefest Apostles</hi> (2 Cor. 12. 11) They desire that all the Praise may run in the right Channel, may go the right way, that is to God: As for themselves,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93064:57"/>
they are nothing, and their Services are nothing in their esteem. Instead of applauding themselves in reflecting upon the much they have done, they rather complain of their little of the much they should have done. To Conclude,</p>
               <p>As a Christian grows in Grace and advances in Religion, there is in him more of a Godly Sorrow, more of an Holy Shame and Ingenuous Blushing at his little.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As Christians are to Excel themselves, and Abound more and more; so <hi>they are to Excel others, to Abound more then others in the Work of the Lord.</hi> If others are coldly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they are to be a People <hi>Zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of good Works:</hi> Else they will not Answer the full Intendment of Christ's Death and Sufferings, who <hi>gave himself</hi> for them, and <hi>Redeemed</hi> and <hi>Purified</hi> them to this end, as its said, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Let then Christ see of the Travail of his Soul, the Fruit and desired effect of his great Sorrows and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; let him see of the Travel of his Soul with joy and delight, and be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93064:57"/>
satisfied, taking full content, and being highly pleased in seeing the fruit of all his labours and pains. Shall a dull and dead, lazy and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Profession of Religion be all the fruit of Christs Sufferings? Will he be satisfied where he sees no better fruit then this? Did Christ Sweat in the Garden, that we should Freeze? Is there no Sap, no more Life in the Tree of the Cross, then to put forth onely Leaves or Blossoms? Assuredly the due consideration of <hi>Christ Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> is that which will make a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>fruitful in Holiness</hi> and in every good Work.</p>
               <p>Christians must be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Patterns of good Works,</hi> Titus 2. and Examples, they must <hi>shine as lights in the World,</hi> (Phil. 2.) If <hi>Others</hi> are lazy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves with doing a little; Yet <hi>They</hi> must be Exemplary in diligence, go early into the Vineyard, and work hard. They must do more then others, not onely more then <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> but more then the seemingly-strict <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> more then Formal Christians; for they are Men <hi>of another Spirit</hi> (as God said of <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93064:58"/>
must follow God fully. They have received from God other Helps and Advantages (Spiritual Light and Strength) God has made <hi>all Grace to Abound</hi> towards them; that so they may <hi>Abound to every good Work,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. They have other Hopes and Expectations, better grounded hopes of a Glorious Reward: They have received Mercies more peculiar then others: And therefore they should do more then others, they should not live as others; as they said (Wisdom 2. 15.) <hi>His Life is not like other Mens, his ways are of another fashion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea amongst Real Christians, one must strive to Excel another; A good strife this is (— <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">I. <hi>They may be assured from the Revelation of the Gospel,</hi> whereby <hi>Light and Immortality is brought to light</hi> (2 Tim. 2. 10.) <hi>Light and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> that is, Immortal Life, Eternal Blessedness both for Soul and Body, is now more clearly revealed and fully assured by the Gospel.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> had Preached at <hi>Corinth</hi> the Chief City of <hi>Achaia</hi> for a longer space of time then he used to do in other Cities, (for <hi>he continued there a Year and Six Months,</hi> Acts 18. 11.) and God encouraged him hereunto, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the many troubles and oppositions he met with from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who unanimously and <hi>with one accord set themselves against Paul,</hi> (Vers. 6. and 12.) God <hi>spake</hi> to him <hi>by Night in a Vision,</hi> that he should <hi>not be afraid nor hold his peace;</hi> for though some did oppose, yet (saith

That <hi>many of the</hi> Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>believed and were Baptized, yea</hi> Crispus, <hi>the Chief Ruler of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, believed on the Lord, with all his House.</hi> And in Obedience to this Heavenly Vision, S. <hi>Paul</hi> did for a long time (a Year and an half) Preach the Gospel to them of <hi>Corinth</hi> clearly, and freely, and with much affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateness to them; his whole Heart was set wide open to them, they had a great place in his affections; This he means, when he tells them in 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> 6. 11. 12. <hi>O ye</hi> Corinthians, <hi>our Mouth is opened to you, our Heart is enlarged, ye are not straitned in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what was it that S. <hi>Paul</hi> took such care to Preach amongst them, and which he did <hi>first of all deliver</hi> unto them (1 Cor. 15. 3.)? It was this, <hi>That Christ died for our sins accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures, and that he was Buried, and that he Rose again the Third Day according to the Scriptures:</hi> And this last-mentioned Article of <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ</hi> (on which Our Resurrection doth depend, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 14.) he particularly enlargeth upon,

Yea, they might assure themselves of this from S. <hi>Paul's</hi> own Testimony; who though he was no Disciple, not a Christian, nor an Apostle while Christ conversed upon Earth; yet he was afterwards at his Conversion an Eye-witness of Christs being alive again; <hi>last of all</hi> (saith he Vers. 8.) <hi>he was seen of me also;</hi> and by this appearing of Christ from Heaven was S. <hi>Paul</hi> Converted: The remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Story we have recorded by S. <hi>Luke</hi> in Acts 9. where Christ in

               </p>
               <p>But what is this to the <hi>Resurrection of Christians?</hi> Very much. For <hi>Our</hi> Resurrection depends on <hi>Christ's.</hi> If

Christ be Risen, then there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the Dead, <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. 16. and then shall We also Rise again. For we must know that Christ is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>the first Fruits of them that Slept</hi> or were Dead. He is twice in this Chapter called <hi>the First fruits</hi> (Vers. 20. 23.) and Col. 1. 15. <hi>The First born of every Creature,</hi> or more sully in Vers. 28. He is <hi>the Head of the Body the Church, He is the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the First born from the Dead,</hi> as he is also Styled <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 5. And these three Titles and peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of his (for <hi>in all things he was to have the Preeminence,</hi> saith the Apostle) evince the Doctrine in hand.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That of <hi>First-fruits</hi> [the <hi>First-fruits of them that Slept.</hi>] For as by the Consecrating and offering up to God the <hi>First-fruits,</hi> the whole Lump or Masse, the whole encrease was Sanctified and Consecrated (for <hi>if the first-fruits be Holy, the Lump,</hi> or <hi>Masse, is also Holy,</hi> Rom. 11.)

               <p>But not onely from the Resurrection of Christ doth the Apostle Labour to prove and clear to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the Resurrection of Christians, but from several other Arguments and Proofs, of which there are not a few in this Chapter; and he doth more largely insist upon this Doctrine here, then he doth elsewhere in his Epistles upon any other: He speaks also more particularly here about the Nature and Quality of the Body to be Raised, of its being <hi>Spiritualiz'd</hi> and <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliz'd,</hi> as also in his 2 Ep. to <hi>Cor.

[<hi>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord.</hi>]</p>
               <p>And there was great need that the Apostle should be so large and earnest in the confirming of this Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there were some at <hi>Corinth</hi> that having before received it, began to deny <hi>the Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> Vers. 12. And indeed this <hi>Leaven of the Sadducees,</hi> the denyal of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and Life to come,</hi> was likely to spread there, such a Doctrine there were many that were apt to receive in this place, and to wish it true (and generally Men from wishing such a thing to be true, in time think it to be true) because <hi>Corinth</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Achaia</hi> being grown a Wealthy City by Merchandise (for the which it was excellently fitted by its Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and as Luxurious and Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as Wealthy (Riches usually Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string to Luxury and Lust) so that it grew to a Proverb, <hi>Non est omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> Corinthum <hi>appellere;</hi> which <hi>Horace</hi> hath exprest in this Verse,<q>

There was a Temple in this City

               <p>To conclude therefore, from the Arguments used by the Apostle in this Epistle for the proof of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> and from what he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at other times (as he intimates in <hi>Vers.</hi> 1. 3) concerning it; the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> might well be assured that their <hi>Labour should not be in vain in the Lord;</hi> And therefore He might well say <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>in it,</hi> it had been firmly embraced by them; And he might well also exhort them <hi>to be Stedfast and Vnmoveable,</hi> to stand firm in the Profession of it (as he doth in the last Verse) and to the like purpose he tells them, in <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. Therefore, <hi>whether it were I or they, so we Preach, and so ye Believed:</hi> Where having before spoken of <hi>Cephas and the other Apostles,</hi> all which were Eye-witnesses of <hi>Christ's Resurrection</hi> (for to them he appeared more then once upon Earth) and having also spoken of himself, to whom Christ appeared from Heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he of his own knowledge could Testifie that Christ was Alive again; he adds <hi>whether it were I or they,</hi> whether ye look upon my own Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or upon the Testimony of his Apostles (of whom he speaks in the foregoing Verse) <hi>so we Preach</hi> (both I and they Preach the same thing) <hi>and so ye Believed;</hi> ye did receive this Truth, and held it without waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               <p>This Doctrine of <hi>the Resurrection and a Reward to come</hi> the <hi>Corinthians</hi> might also know from the Preaching of <hi>Cephas</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or of some of his Disciples: And from the Preaching of <hi>Apollos,</hi> Who was <hi>an Eloquent Man and Mighty in the Scripture,</hi> and <hi>being Fervent in Spirit,</hi> (an instance of which is that in Vers. 28. <gap reason="foreign">

this from the Preaching of <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> so some from Christ himself pretended to have been instructed in the Christian Doctrine: As appears by those divisions amongst them, in saying, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and I of</hi> Christ; as we read in 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And no wonder that <hi>S. Paul</hi> and the Apostles were so much upon this: For the Doctrine of the Resurrection, of <hi>Christs Resurrection</hi> first, is a Doctrine of greatest Importance, as it makes for the encouragement of our Faith and Hope in God (for <hi>he was raised for our Justification,</hi> Rom. 4.) and as it makes for the justifying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Gospel, the Doctrine that he taught; there being no greater proof or evidence that the most Doubting and Sceptical and Prejudiced could desire or expect to have, to prove one to be a true Prophet, <hi>a Teacher sent from God,</hi> and that his Doctrine was from God, then this, if the Prophet or Teacher should fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel and give it them for a Sign to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, That after his being put to Death by those that would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, he should arise and live
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93064:64"/>
again in the World, and within such a time; which was fulfill'd and verified in our Saviour; and this was his last Sign superadded to the other Signs, the Miracles which he wrought, and is called <hi>The Sign of the Prophet</hi> Jonas; <hi>For as</hi> Jonas <hi>was Three Days and Three Nights in the</hi> Whale's <hi>Belly, so shall the Son of Man be Three Days and Three Nights in the Heart of the Earth</hi> (Matth. 12. 40.) And indeed this Sign of the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> was was very fitly remarkeable, Briefly to gloss upon it.</p>
               <p>In this great Sea of the World its no wonder if the great Tempest of God's Anger doth arise by reason of Mens Sins, so that all are in danger to be cast away and Perish: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>it was expedient that one should Die</hi> (as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High-Priest spake, and more Prophetically then he was aware of, <hi>Jo. 11. 50</hi>) <hi>Jonas</hi> was cast into the Sea, that the rest might be saved, and the Sea calmed. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himself to them, to stav the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Sea, and to save them from perishing; And Christ offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to those that came with <hi>Judas</hi> to apprehend him and bring him to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93064:65"/>
his Suffering, which was designed and agreed on by the Chief of the <hi>Jews</hi> (Jo. 18. 8.) <hi>I have told you that I am he. If therefore ye seek me let these</hi> (his Disciples he means) <hi>go their way:</hi> I am the Man that must stay the Storm. <hi>Jonas</hi> was in the <hi>Belly of the</hi> Whale (Jon. 2. 1.) and <hi>in the Heart of the Seas,</hi> (Vers. 3.) and this <hi>Belly of the</hi> Whale he calls <hi>the Belly of Hell,</hi> so that he was as good as lost or dead, it was a wonder that he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, he was dead <hi>in a Figure</hi> (as tis said of <hi>Isaac,</hi> Heb. 11.) And <hi>Christ</hi> was in the Heart of the Earth, in the Belly of the Grave, he was dead not in a Figure onely, but really dead and buried. <hi>Jonas</hi> was restored the Third Day to the dry Land alive [<hi>Thou hast</hi> (saith he) <hi>brought up my Life from Corruption, O Lord my God</hi>] And so was <hi>Christ</hi> restored the Third Day to the Land of the Living. And to cast in and superadd one Resemblance more, though not of this kind, <hi>Jonas</hi> arose and went to <hi>Nineveh</hi> (a great and populous City) to Preach Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to them: And <hi>Christ</hi> being risen from the dead, <hi>Repentance and Remission of Sins was to be Preached

in his Name, among all Nations,</hi> not to one City or one Nation onely, though first it was to be Preacht at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Luke 24. 47.</p>
               <p>And as the Apostles Preached <hi>Jesus,</hi> and <hi>his Resurrection,</hi> and did it <hi>with great Power,</hi> as it is exprest in Acts 4.

it Gall'd the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> who were grieved that they Preached <hi>through Jesus the Resurrection from the Dead,</hi> Acts 4. 2.

               <p>But to return to our Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> (who <hi>by the Grace of God laboured more abundantly then they all</hi>) He very largely and freely, Preached <hi>Christs</hi> Resurrection, and <hi>Ours:</hi> That this was his constant Employment, He affirms it in his defence before King <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Festus</hi> the Roman Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, Acts 26.

was entertain'd with scorn, as idle talk and for which he was counted <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (and for such and no better it was esteemed by <hi>Pliny</hi> (in <hi>Hist.

This Court was the Supreme Court of Justice at <hi>Athens,</hi> the Judges were persons of great note, and renown'd for their Wisdom and Integrity, able and fit to Judge of the most weighty matters, and therefore were the most
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93064:67"/>
difficult causes wont to be refer'd to them; they sat in the Dark, that they might not be moved to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due affection and compassion upon Sight of the Malefactor; they would not permit him <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to use any Rhetorick to move their affections, but onely to make a plain and bare Narration: They were also very strict and severe in enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Lives and Manners of Men (for this was another End to which this Court was appointed) and taking an account hereof, <hi>ubi quid quisque Atheniensium ageret, diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimè inquiri soleb at, ut homines honesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem (vitae rationem memores reddendam esse) sequerentur</hi> (as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> describes it) <hi>they were strictly inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive what any one of the</hi> Athenians <hi>did, how he demean'd himself, that Men might see it to be their interest to live well, as considering that they were to give an account of their lives and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour;</hi> and therefore it was called <hi>Sanctissimum Consilium,</hi> the most Holy Council or Judicatory; and by this it seem'd a little Representation of the Great Tribunal of Christ and Solemn Day of Judgment, at what time <hi>the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93064:68"/>
Books shall be opened,</hi> the Rolls where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Mens Actions are Recorded; and when <hi>All must appear before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether good or evil,</hi> as the Apostle speaks in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. And upon this account and consideration (as a proper and powerful perswasive to a good Life) he would have Christians to make it their great design and Holy Ambition to live so as <hi>to be acceptable unto God,</hi> in the foregoing Verse, as he adds also in the following Verse, <hi>Knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord</hi> (this dreadful appearance of the Lord at the Last Day) <hi>we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we see how the Apostle made it his great care and business to Preach the <hi>Resurrection of Christ,</hi> as also the <hi>General Resurrection,</hi> or (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to as much) the <hi>Great Day of Judgment.</hi> What ever Doctrine, more smooth and flattering, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with Mens e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e and carnality, Others might Teach, yet this is that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> with all faithfullness Preacht unto the World, this was
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93064:68"/>
his Preaching of the Gospel, he made sure always to clear, and confirm, and inculcate this great Evangelical Truth, this Fundamental Article of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, <hi>The Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning which, I shall onely add this one Consideration more (and its worthy to be well consider'd by us) That though in this <hi>Fifteenth Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> he useth many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to evince and perswade the Belief of <hi>Our Resurrection,</hi> yet <hi>first of all,</hi> and <hi>principally,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) he makes use of <hi>the Resurrection of Christ</hi> for the proof of it, who rose as the <hi>Head of the Church</hi> (the Second <hi>Adam</hi> being a Common Head, as well as the First, in the Sense we have shewed) and as the <hi>First fruits of them that Slept,</hi> and the <hi>First-born from the Dead.</hi> And further consider. That the Argument drawn from Christs being Raised to Life, and to a Life of <hi>Immortal Blessedness</hi> (Rom. 6. 9) is a most plain and easie Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove that there is a Blessed Life and Immortality hereafter. There are other Arguments to evince this,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93064:69"/>
but some of them are too sublime for every capacity; but the meanest are capable of understanding this; For the Man Christ, one in our nature and flesh, Died, and Rose again, and is now Alive, and liveth for Ever; which is an evident proof of a future Life after the Death of the Body, and a fair pledge of a Blessed Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality hereafter, which God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the faithful with, those that have <hi>the Spirit of God dwelling in them,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11.</p>
               <p>And now having seen how Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians have good ground to hope for, and expect a Future Reward of Soul and Body from the Light of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, we shall shew (in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments) how they may hope for it from the Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. From the Justice of God, they may know their Labour is not in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Justice manifests it self in <hi>ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to every one according to his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93064:69"/>
works,</hi> and this <hi>without any respect of Persons:</hi> Both Maximes are much insisted upon in the Scriptures both of the Old and New Testament. The first is acknowledged by <hi>David</hi> the Royal Psalmist, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 62. 12. by that Royàl Oracle of Wisdom, <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 12. by the Prophets, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 32. 19. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 20. and by one greater then <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Prophets, even <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> the Judge himself, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 27. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 12. and by his Apostles, <hi>S. Paul, Rom.</hi> 2. 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. and <hi>S. Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
               <p>Now the ways or works of Men are either good or evil; and God who rewards, cannot be deceived or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken; (as not corrupted or wrought upon by fear or flattery) but he has a perfect knowledge, and just value of Mens works, knows the inward Springs and Principles of their actions: And <hi>he which is Lord over all, shall fear no Mans persons,</hi> nor shall he stand in awe of any Mans greatness, &amp;c. Wisdom 6. 7. <hi>He seeth not as Man seeth, for Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93064:70"/>
Heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 16. 7. <hi>The Righteous Lord tries the Reines and Heart,</hi> Psal. 7. 9. And this, <hi>That he may give every Man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings;</hi> which is mention'd with God's search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pondering the Heart, and trying the Reins, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 10. Prov. 24. 12.</p>
               <p>And that God renders to every one <hi>without respect of persons,</hi> is a Maxime frequently also asserted in Scripture, in the Old Testament, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>Job</hi> 34. 19 and in the New Testament, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 25. We read in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 1. that <hi>A false Ballance is Abomination to the Lord,</hi> surely then God will not Practise that himself, which he Abominates in Men; but he will weigh the actions of Men in a true Ballance. He will be far from all Partiality and respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which are false Weights and Measures, and Ballances of deceit. He will not accept or respect persons in Judgment. In the dispensation of Rewards and Punishment, he will not regard or look at any thing but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93064:70"/>
the temper of their Minds, and their Actions, whether good or evil.</p>
               <p>Now the Justice of God requires <hi>ut bonis bene, malis male sit.</hi> Isa. 3. 10, 11. <hi>Say ye to the Righteous, That</hi> it shall be <hi>well</hi> with him. <hi>Wo unto the wicked,</hi> it shall be <hi>ill</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>But we often experience it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be in this World, yea good Men in the Old Testament found it not seldome to be otherwise; and yet under that dispensation there is more abundant mention of Temporal good things in the Promises there recorded; and hence were those complaints in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 15. and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. from Verse 3. to 12. (as <hi>Job</hi> 12. 6.) and in <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 1. and Holy <hi>David</hi> observ'd the like of <hi>wicked Men, the Men of the World,</hi> Psal. 17. 14. and in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> the Calamities of the most Eminent in goodness are described, <hi>Vers.</hi> 36. 37, 38.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Israelites</hi> (God's People) gather Straw. make Brick, live a Life of bitter affliction, when as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> live at ease, and in pleasures. When <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Children were
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93064:71"/>
afflicted, partly as being in a Sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uncertain condition, and partly while they were Strangers and Servants in <hi>Egypt, Esau</hi> and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity flourished in Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lazarus</hi> (a Son of <hi>Abraham</hi>) had many <hi>evil things,</hi> was in hard Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, not onely poor, but <hi>full of Sores,</hi> a sick weak thing, unable to get his Bread with labour and sweat of his brows; desired but <hi>the Crumbs that fell from the Rich Mans Table. Dives</hi> the Rich Man, and wicked, had his <hi>good things;</hi> he was Richly Attired, and <hi>fared Deliciously every Day,</hi> (Luke 16. 19.) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Every Day</hi> he enjoy'd all that made for pleasure, and not onely at some great or Solemn times; He and his Five Brethren with other jolly Company: While others (as <hi>Lazarus</hi>) fared hardly.</p>
               <p>So that Sin is not alway punished in this Life, nor Holiness rewarded.</p>
               <p>God did not render unto <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and those <hi>of whom the World was not Worthy,</hi> he did not render unto them in this Life according to what they had done or suffered.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:93064:71"/>
               <p>God did not render unto <hi>Dives</hi> here according to the evil he did, his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulness, his Luxury and Riot, with the Sins attending thereon; He had the good things of this Life, lived in ease and pleasure, he received in full Measure <hi>his good things:</hi> Now this was not a Reward according to what he did; he Reaped what was better then he Sowed.</p>
               <p>And therefore if Divine Providence does not equally distribute Rewards and Punishments here; it follows, since God is Just, That in the World to come he will dispense Rewards and Punishments according as they have lived here; <hi>that every one may receive according to what they have done in the Body, whether good or evil.</hi> There is therefore a time, a Day to come, wherein the Judge of the World will make it appear that he did weigh and consider the Spirits and Lives of all Men, and now they shall be dealt with according as they have done <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> here, and therefore this time is called, Rom. 2. 5. <hi>The Day of the Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:93064:72"/>
               <p>This Argument taken from the Justice of God, is mention'd by the Apostle in 2 Thes. 1. 6, 7. <hi>It is a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing with God to recompense Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them that trouble you: And to you who are troubled, Rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In short thus, God the Wise and Righteous Law-giver and Ruler of the World, hath given us a Law and Rule to walk by and govern us, and he hath shewed us <hi>what is good, and what the Lord our God requires of us,</hi> (and his Will is Holy, and Wise and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) this Law he hath Written in Mans Conscience, and hath more fully declared it in his Word: Now he will not let the Transgression of his Righteous Law, the open and constant violation of it by wicked Men, go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished; tho' he may bear with them here for a while, he will not suffer them to devour and cruelly to treat his obedient Servants; <hi>the Rod of the wicked shall not</hi> always <hi>rest upon the Lot of the Righteous,</hi> (Psal. 125.) But they shall know that there is a God that Judgeth in the Earth, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93064:72"/>
shall find that <hi>Tribulation and Anguish, Indignation and Wrath,</hi> will be <hi>to every Soul that doth Evil,</hi> Rom. 2.</p>
               <p>Nor will God forget the faithful and sincere obedience of his Servants, but will <hi>render Eternal Life to them that by patient continuance in well-doing seek for Honour, and Glory, and Immortality.</hi> So in Hebr. 6. 10. <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of Love.</hi> He hath his <hi>Book of remembrance,</hi> Mal. 3. He hath promised and <hi>Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> a <hi>Crown of Life;</hi> and this Crown of Life and Glory is also <hi>a Crown of Righteousness,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. And God as he is <hi>the Righteous Judge</hi> (as well as a God of Mercy) will give it, because he hath promised to give it upon the Terms of Faith and sincere Obedience, or <hi>patient continuance</hi> in well doing: And he who hath promised, will be Just and Righteous to perform; as he is abundantly Merciful in Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Infirmities and Imperfections, and also in Rewarding us and doing for us exceeding abundantly above all that we have done. So Rich is his Mercy, and so Noble his Goodness: And so far are our works, our doings
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93064:73"/>
or sufferings from any Merit or any Worthiness, to be compared with the Reward and <hi>Glory to be revealed,</hi> Rom. 8. It is a Merciful Justice, and therefore its said in Psal. 62. 12. <hi>Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth Mercy: For thou rendrest to every Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Human Judicatories and Tribunals cannot take notice of all Sins and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; and where they do, they may be corrupted or bribed, or they may be deceived and mistaken. But the Judge of all the Earth, <hi>he regardeth not persons nor taketh reward,</hi> Deut. 10. 27. Nor can he be deceived by false pretensions; for <hi>the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. and <hi>before him all things are naked and open,</hi> Heb. 4.</p>
               <p>Humane Laws onely restrain <hi>Words</hi> and outward <hi>Actions;</hi> But the Divine Law reacheth the Spirit of Man, his inward <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Secrets of the Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are <hi>Spiritual</hi> Sins, as Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, Pride of Heart, Envy, Lusts of the Heart, Murder of the Heart; These, and the like, are not punished
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93064:73"/>
by Human Laws, but are greatly Criminal before God.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>Speculative</hi> Sins; Sins acted over in the Phansy, and there repeated and remember'd with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light (when the outward act is past) which are highly provoking to God, and shall be judged: For, for Men to do this, to recal in their thoughts with pleasure and delight such and such Sins, is to act over the same Sins in Phancy and Speculation, to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their Sins by new and fresh guilt, it is to stand to and make good their former Transgressions, instead of repenting of them; for then they would be remembred with Sorrow and Abhorrence.</p>
               <p>These Sins not falling under Mans Cognisance; as onely <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> do, but not <hi>Thoughts</hi> (which yet are the first contrivers of that Sin and evil in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi>) and these Sins escaping the Judgment and Punishments of Humane Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; yet shall not escape the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Day of Judgment</hi> is described by this, 1 Cor. 4. 5. <hi>Judge nothing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93064:74"/>
before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the Hidden things of Darkness, and will make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the Counsels of the Heart; and then shall every Man have praise of God;</hi> that is, every one that hath done well; as on the contrary, they shall have <hi>shame and everlasting contempt</hi> (Dan. 12. 2.) that have done evil, how cunning and close soever they were, and whatsoever fair pretences they might make before Men. The Day of Judgment is described here by <hi>the time when Christ shall bring to light the Hidden things of Darkness, and make manifest the Counsels of the Heart:</hi> And so in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. its call'd <hi>the Day when God shall judge the secrets of Men by Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. From the Testimony of Conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conscience is God's Deputy and Vice-gerent. The voice of Conscience is God's voice, and it does powerfully witness a Future State, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments to be dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therein, according to what we have done here, Good or Evil.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:93064:74"/>
               <p>Upon the Consciousness of doing their duty, there arises within Men a Peace, and Satisfaction, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable expectations from God who is the Father of Mercies. And there is no such satisfaction, no such joyous reflections as those; as 'twas said of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feast is a good Conscience; But this Feast is but an Antipast, a foretast of a better in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Now on the contrary, there follows upon Sin, inward Trouble, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, and Fear, a fearful expectation of a sad after-reckoning and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come. <hi>Hae sunt impijs assiduae domesticaeque furiae</hi> (saith <hi>Tully.</hi>) And these inward Fears and Troubles, Terrors of another World, are not imprest upon Men by Politians and Statesmen, for Secular ends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of State, to awe Men into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) They follow upon such sins as are not punishable by Human Laws, as Secret Sins, Sins of the Heart, Speculative Sins and Spiritual
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93064:75"/>
Wickednesses; which are such Sins as no Earthly Judges, no Magistrates can have Cognisance of, and no Human Laws can reach: It would be a vain thing for the Supreme Powers to make Laws about what its impossible for them to know, and consequently impossible for them to punish.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Yea, they follow upon such Sins as are hid from Men, if punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by Laws when discovered, such Sins as no Man can accuse the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor of, or not prove them against him.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Yea, they follow upon such sins, as being known by Man, yet are not punishable by the Laws of that Country, nay sometimes are applauded and esteem'd by Men. <hi>Judas</hi> his sin was so far from being punished by the <hi>Jewish</hi> Powers, that he was rewarded for it; But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he had, and all the applause and encouragement they could give him, could not ease and sree him from the Anguish in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93064:75"/>
and Fear of what was to come.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Yea these Fears and Terrors are found to be amongst them in whom is no Policy, Nations that are rude and barbarous, and not governed by Crafty Polititians; yet even in such appear'd <hi>Magna vis Conscientiae:</hi> So universally have they possest Men, and in all ages; whereas vain and causeless and <hi>Panick</hi> Fears are of a short and uncertain continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and not so universal, as these inward Fears and Troubles of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Nor are these Fears pleasing and grateful to Men (as is easie for any Man to judge and acknowledge) but contrary to the inclinations of Men, who are carried out to the love and practise of such Sins (as Revenge, Injustice, Lust, and the like) whence these inward Troubles arise.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) To what hath been said, I shall superadd this, That the Deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Polititians and Greatest States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Greatest Potentates of the Earth are not more free and secure
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93064:76"/>
from these inward Fears then the <hi>populus terrae,</hi> the mean Peasants and those of low degree (which yet these Grandees could not have been disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, had they known that these were but arts and a juggle invented by them for State-reasons) yea the Great Men of the Earth, Men of Policy and Power, have been rather more severely lasht <hi>caeco verbere,</hi> with these secret and unseen lashes: They have been more severely assaulted and haunted by these <hi>domesticae furiae</hi> and inward Horrors, though they would fain have been delivered from them, and have used all arts to be freed from this evil Spirit, a Self-corroding and tormenting Conscience, which troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4. From the Souls inward Sense in good Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are certain Instincts and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies and Propensions in the Soul of Man to Religion, to God and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him; and these are more especially enlivened, and vigorous, in Holy and renewed Souls. There
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93064:76"/>
is a vehement thirst and longing in such Souls after Union with God, the Father of Spirits: Their Souls pant after God, after the living God, that they may see and enjoy him whom their Souls love, whom they have chosen for their Portion, for whom they have forsaken all the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the World, and denyed All to enjoy Him; They have none in Heaven but Him, none in Earth in comparison of Him. As for this present Life and State, they groan being burdened, while they are in this Tabernacle; this is their State of Pilgrimage; while they are here, they are <hi>absent from the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.</p>
               <p>And hence it is that these Holy Souls perswade themselves that the Father of Spirits, God who is Love, that implanted these Instincts and Affections in them, that hath awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them by his Grace, that hath drawn out their Hearts after him, so that the Love of God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd them to count nothing that he commanded them grievous to do,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93064:77"/>
nothing hard to suffer for him, they perswade themselves that God will satisfie these Desires and Affections of his own begetting in them, <hi>I shall be satisfied when I awake, with thy likeness</hi> (as Holy <hi>David</hi> speaks <hi>Psal.</hi> 17.) and that their Souls who cleave to God in love, who desire and love him above all things, and do more thirst after a full Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him from the lesser tastes and relishes of his Goodness here, and hope to see him as he is, face to face hereafter, shall not be frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their desires and hopes; but God will satisfie these by the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of some better State and Enjoyment then of this World, which is not their Portion, nor did they mind Earthly things. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade themselves that God will not forsake them, nor thrust away the Soul that thirsts after him, and loves and desires him above all, and places her Felicity in him; and when it has most prepared her self, as a Bride adorned for her Husband, for the other State, and is more near to enjoy him, as it is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93064:77"/>
when the Death of the Body is near.</p>
               <p>That such a Soul should be cut off from God, and cast into the place of forgetfulness and be no more, so as she should never enjoy God (nor indeed any thing else) is not to be conceived, it being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly contrary to the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Hath God implanted in Brute Beasts such and such Propensions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts, Sympathies and Antipathies, the Passions of Fear and Aversation, the Affections of Hope, and Desire, and Joy, with real and proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for them to be respectively exercised upon; So that they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fear and avoid what is for their hurt, and they hope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and delight in what is for their welfare and pleasure? And is it to be imagined that the same Passions which are implanted by God in Better and Higher Beings, the Souls of Men, and in Holy and renewed Souls (the Best Souls) have not
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93064:78"/>
suiteable Objects for them also? Is the Hope of enjoying God, and a Blessed Immortality, and the Future State (and the Joy thence arising, or, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. the <hi>rejoycing in Hope of the Glory of God</hi>) a vain Hope, a vain Joy? Do the Best Men act like Fools, and unwisely, in denying themselves as to many advantages and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in this World, for an <hi>Vtopian</hi> Paradise, for a Nothing, for that which is not? Are all the Religious Instincts and Propensions towards God, which are rooted in the Souls of Men, and are most active in the Souls of Holy Men, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially towards the end of their Life, are they Frustraneous and Vain?</p>
               <p>But we cannot imagine things to be thus, without highly reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the God of Nature, God most Wise and most Good, who <hi>made all his Works in Wisdom,</hi> (Psal. 104. 24. which <hi>Wisdom reacheth from one end to another, and sweetly orders all things,</hi> Wisdom. 8. 1.) and who
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93064:78"/>
saw every thing that he had made, <hi>that it was good, very good</hi> (Genes. 1.) and accordingly fitted every Creature for its End, which it knows, and observes the proper means to attain it; this Wise and Good God did not surely do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in making of Man, but he hath excellently fitted him for the Highest and Best End; and Holy Souls are in the readiest capacity for it. Hence that in 2 Cor. 5. 5. <hi>He that hath wrought us for the self same thing, is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the light of Reason: Concerning which, if any shall object, That this last Argument (as also the former) seems not so much to prove the Resurrection of the Body, as a Life to come, or a Blessed Immortality of the Soul after the Death of the Body; I answer, Be it so, yet they are of force to prove that which was
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93064:79"/>
the matter in hand, viz. <hi>That those who Abound in the Work of the Lord, their Labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
