            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Ilandes of Balino, neere vnto the Citie of Dolno, there liued a great Duke named <hi>Firento Sanelli,</hi> a great Lord I saie, for that he was great both in honor and possessions: he was wise, and therfore much honored; honorable, and therefore much beloued; with his wealth he was full of charity, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enuied of none, but the courtous: hee was valiant, and therefore feared of the wicked: but couetous, and therfore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with the kinde: and vertuous, and therfore blessed by the highest. This Lord had to wife a swéete Ladie, called <hi>Merilla,</hi> a creature of much worth, in the best construction of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and if a woman might be like an Angell, she might be saincted for her vertues: her modestie with his grauity, her pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with his valour, her loue with his charity, her bountie with his wealth, and her zeale with his vertue, made such a coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in perfections, as that vnder the heauens, there were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie found such creatures on the earth.</p>
            <p>This blessed Lord and Ladie had issue male, onelie one sonne named <hi>Penillo,</hi> and female one onlie daughter named <hi>Merilla:</hi> the parents of these two children, liued till they sawe them both to followe their course in the best content of their affections: <hi>Penillo</hi> was of the age of foure and twentie yeares, of stature tall, ruddie of colour, well complexioned, but not too faire; his haire not blacke, but somewhat-inclining thereto, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10212:5"/>
milde, but not effeminate, his proportion in no part im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, &amp; for his minde, it was of an excellent temper: he was silent, but vpon good cause, and then not to learne what to speak; resolute, vpon good aduisement, but not rash vpon anie aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: he was well read in histories, and well qualified in manie points, but especiallie in the varietie of languages, wherin he exceeded maine of his fathers court: he was stated for his wit, gentle in nature, kinde with discretion, bountifull in rewards, not vaine in affection, and constant in friendship; in somme, he was amiable among Ladies, affable among Courtiers, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable among souldiers, and honorable among all: such a one, as was a ioie to his Parents, a spectable to his Court, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to his friendes, and an honour to his country.</p>
            <p>Now for his sister, as shee was excéeding faire, so was shée admirably wise, yet with such modest kindnesse, that she was so honored for the one, that she could not but bee loued for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For euerie part of her proportion, let it suffice, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shewed her Arte, in leauing nothing imperfect; for her stature not tall, nor verie low, but in a swéete meane; her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance sober with such a swéetnesse, as rauished the loue of much discretion; her spéech not much; but vttered with such go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, as amazed the hearers, that could iudge of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of commendation; her affection chiefely carried vnto vertue, and her loue knowne but vnto one, of whome depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a great part of my historie, as hereafter you shall heare. But I will leaue further to talke either of her, or her louer in this place: and onelie entreat of another Duke, who dwelt in the Ilandes of Cotasie, confining vpon the aforesaid Ilandes of Balino.</p>
            <p>This Duke had to name <hi>Ordillo,</hi> a man famous for much worth as well in wit as valour: who in all his warres against his enemies was neuer knowne to turne his backe, but with aduantage, vpon retire, gaue ouer no assault till he had entred the strengths, nor surceased his warres till he had the honour of the field: he was at home a Lambe, and abroad a Lyon, where wisedome with clemencie so gouerned the nature of his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that his subiectes no lesse loued him, then his enemies
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10212:5"/>
did honnor him: In particular, to laie downe his commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were but tedious, and therfore in somme let it suffice that he was a Prince of that worth, that made him held worthie of his gouernment.</p>
            <p>This Duke had to wife a gratious Ladie, whose goodnes was such in the worlde, as made her soone fit for the heauens: for such was her delight in diuine contemplations, and so little her foie in anie earthlie substance, that languishing in the worlde with longing after heauen, shee liued not manie yeares with her louing Lord on the earth, but the Lorde of all loue tooke her vp into the heauens: yet before her departure from this life, she had by her Lorde the Duke, two blessed children, a sonne and a daughter; her sonne, named <hi>Fantiro,</hi> and her daughter <hi>Sinilia.</hi> The young Lord, a man of excellent partes, both for bodie, and mind, whose particular perfections, would requre a volume to describe in their true kindes, but for that by a little light, mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The olde man loath to mooue griefe in his sonne, whose deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued loue he was fullie assured of, and yet willing to be satisfied of his true resolution, touching his humour of trauaile, with much adoe brake into this spéech with him. <hi>Penillo,</hi> I haue of late noted in thee, as well by thy studie in the languages, as by thy conuersation among strangers, and thy loue to souldiers, that the aduenture of thy fortune abroad will be more pleasing to thee, then thy best contentment at home: but if I might by the aduise of my experience, perswade thée to the care of my knowledge, I should easily make thée finde the sweete of the old prouerbe, that home is home, be it neuer so homely: The row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling stone gatheresh no mosse, &amp; that prospereth in one ground maie perish in another. Aduentures are dangerous, the seas boistrous, and the warres perilous, and great is the difference betweene strange companions, and home friendes: what canst thou sée abroad, that is not here?

            <p>The young Prince caried no lesse in obedience to the loue of his father, then willing to aduenture his fortune, to atchieue the honor of his hope, in as good tearmes as he coulde, vppon the sodaine made his father this answere.

Your maiestie would euer preferre a trotting courser, before an ambling lootecloth, a peale of ordinance, before a ring of belies, and a bloudie sword before a painted looking glasse: in somme, if in alsuch courses of your conceit, you followed the inclination of my Grandfather, will you think it strange in me to follow the steps of your affection? Haue you not allowed my reading of histories, and how many of any account are written onelie of home actions? Haue you not wisht me to make much of strangers? and shall I not studie languages where with to entertaine them? I must confesse there is no friend to a father, whose loue cannot be separated from the fruit of his own body. Home dwelling is full of ease, but not of honour, which is rather purchased by aduentures, then by nature inherited: friends are kind, so maie strangers be full of courtesse, and he that looketh not into the world, wanteth much wherein to glorifie the Lorde God.

            <p>This young Princesse the onlie daughter of <hi>Ordillo,</hi> not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affecting the outward person, &amp; inward vertue of this young Prince, who was nothing behinde with her in great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with her much worthines of his good liking, tooke occasion one morning, séeing him walking out of his lodging into a garden, right against her chamber windowe to take a priuate waie through a gallerie downe into the same garden, where in a close walke néere vnto the gréene alley where the Prince was walking vnséene of him a pretie while, fell into this talke with a gentlewoman an attendant of hers, whom she held in great account, and to whom she reuealed the secret of all her hart: Oh <hi>Delina</hi> quoth she (for so was her name) little doest thou know the cause of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ate melancholie, but I dare trust thée with my life, and for that I know thou hast past through the Labyrinth, that I am nowe in, I will hope the better of thy aduise for my comfort: Since the comming of the Prince <hi>Penillo,</hi> into my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Court, thou hast not séene me hartely merrie, for though I conceale much of my passion, yet will I somwhat ease my hart, with telling thée somewhat of my minde. Some foure or fiue daies before the newes came to our court of the arriuall of this worthy Prince, I had a dreame that held me all the time of my sléepe, the most part of a whole night: the remembrance whereof in the morning and euer since, hath troubled mee verie much: which as néere as I can remember I will tell thée.</p>
            <p>Me thought I was going thorough a thick wood, where were a number of nettes and snares, layde in euerie pathe where I shoulde passe, yet me thought I passed thorough them so easily, as if they had beene of no strength; till at last I came towarde a great water, where neere vnto the shore laie a great Boate, and from the Boate laie a long line, made all of golde &amp; pearle, within the compasse whereof, treading yer I was aware, mee thought some thing gaue a snatche, wherewith the line whip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

about my middle, and caried mee into the Boate, with the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine fright whereof I awaked. Now what saiest thou to this dreame? <hi>Delina,</hi> no lesse witty concetted of her dreame, then noting the cariage of her humor, made her this answere. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame if a blind body may catch a Hare, I may happen to come somewhat néere the expasition of this night fansie. The wood you went in, is the court, the nettes, the eies and tongues of your sutors, that had no power to take sure holde of your affection; now the great water maie be the Sea, and the golden line, the young Prince, that may cary you away from your father: for if I be not much deceiued, he hath you by the heart, whatsoeuer it was that helde you by the middle. Unhappie wench, quoth the Princesse, thou rouest too néere, that hittest the marke so right: but yet maiest thou bee deceiued in one point, thoughe not in some other; I haue past the nettes, that is true; and I am caught, it is not vntrue, but that he either wil, or shall carie me awaie, that I feare will not fall out: But God knoweth all, tò whose onelie will I leaue it, as farre may come as neere, foes maie be friends, and loue where he doth light doth more then all the world besides. His presence maie please the purest eie, and for his wit, I heard my father woonder at it, for his bountie, our court speaketh of it, and for his vertue, who doth not see it? but for his loue, happy is shee that shall enidie it: for princesse wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with honourable bountie, shewes a diuine spirite in an excellent nature, and of such a temper I hold him, and for such a one I loue him, and will euer honour him, though I neuer haue him.</p>
            <p>The young Prince hearing this pretty parly betwixt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of his loue, and her handmaid, with a voice lowde enoughe to be heard of them that were so neere, fell thus to talke to the aire: Oh heauens, who can withstand the force of the fates? was I going to the wars to gaine honor in the fielde, and am I dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to seeke a peace, by being vanquished in a chamber? Did I go to fight with the great Turke, and am I now afraide of a little Christian? Is this the fruit of a storme at Sea? to come into this kind of calme at lande? Well what shoulde I talke to the trees that heare mee not? or to the birdes that vnderstande

Oh <hi>Bilanta,</hi> blessed werte thou borne, if thy beautie haue beene the beginning of my happines; and happie, if thy vertue ioine issue with my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: for though our parentes be at iarre, we maie be at one, and what anger in them cannot yéeld vnto, loue maie effect in vs, an ende of heartburning in our patentes, and a beginning of quiet in our countries. But howe shall I hope of thy loue? my fathers displeasure maie brééde a doubt of my loue; besides she maie be affected otherwise then I know: where at the young Princesse in her close walk replied no. What quothe the young Prince, is there here such an eccho? The Ladie againe replied, oh. The young Prince amazed at this eccho, went on with this speech: Oh that I knew <hi>Bilanta</hi> indeede would regard my loue; she answeared loue: Loue quoth the Prince, but whome doeth she meane? I would I knewe his name; she answeared name: name quoth the Prince, but who maie it be? If it be one onelie, shee answeared onelie: Onelie quoshe hee, onelie happie in déede, would so were <hi>Pinello;</hi> she made answere <hi>Pinello:</hi> With that the Prince putting the wordes of the eccho together, made vp this speech: Oh loue, name onelie <hi>Pinello.</hi> And musing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vpon his conceit of this sound, looking aside, espied the young princesse, with her attendant walking out of the Arbour into the Garden, whome meeting with, at the ende of a crosse alley, he saluted with this gréeting.</p>
            <p>Sweete Princesse, when there bee two Suns shining at one instant, it cannot be but faire weather: one in the skie, and an other on the earth, both which meete so sweetelie in this blessed péece of ground, that let him die in his bed, that will not walke in such a morning. The Lady not fully perswaded of his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for al his playing with ecche, and yet hoping wel of his words, till his deedes fell out otherwise, with a modest smile made him this answeare. My Lord, if your spéeches were not so high in the cloudes, that poore soules on the earth know not how to gesse of your meaning, I shoulde bee the better able to frame an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare to your salutation; but howsoeuer the sun shine in the heauens, the shadow of your imagination, if it were a substance of that worth, that might answeare a far lesse figure, then your

fauour, would be loath that anie fowle weather shoulde hinder the happines of your faire walke: but I perceiue such mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Astronomers can plaie prettilie with their owne humors. Prettie Lady (quoth the prince) the best plaie that I know, is at, <hi>be you pleasde,</hi> where hee that lightes vppon a good carde were vnwise if he woulde change: the princesse rouing vnhappilie at his conceit replied againe, and yet my Lord, to be afraid of good fortune, is sometime cause of much losse: yea Madame answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Prince, but fortune is so fantasticall, that there is no trust to be had in her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therfore I hold my opinion; rather to kéepe a good choise, then to aduenture a bad change. I am no gamster answered the Princesse, and therfore can speake but i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlte of the sport, but they that are pleasde are happie, and they will not hold themselues so, are vnwise. The Prince playing vpon this word pleasde, went forwarde with this speech: Good Madam, mate it then please you to be pleasde, with the seruice of my affection? which no further then desart, will seeke the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of your fauour. The Ladie with a modest smile somewhat concealing her content, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> him this answere: My good Lord, I am glad it pleaseth your greatnesse to be so merry with your poore friends: but such seruice, as your fauour, must be graced with greater honour then my vnworthinesse can accomplish.</p>
            <p>The Prince not a little contented with her spéech, replied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in these words: Madam, to make a long haruest about a little corne, were but a weake piece of husbandrie; and therfore not to hold you with a tedious discourse in plaine tearmes, you are the card that I meane, my plaie is no iest, your loue is the stake, that I would be glad if I could to win, you are the choise, that I haue made, and that I would bee loath to change: and therfore if a souldiers eloquence, maie haue fauour in your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, let my heart and hand in your honour speake for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart in your affection. The Ladie not able to couer the fire, that was now past kindling, brake sodainlie into this answere. My Lorde, to reape the corne ere it be ripe, maie prooue more haste then good spéede, and yet to let it grow till it shedde, were great losse to the farmer; and therfore the taking of time is profitable to the prouident. I will not teach your honour what to doe, but

if my loue be the prize of your pleasure, you cannot loose the hope of your patience, assuring my selfe, that the reach of your conceit, excéedeth not the roialtie of your spirit; which in the regard of vertue deserueth nothing but honour: and for that the heart of a souldier, is frée from the tongue of a dissembler. I will rather beleeue the truth of valour, then giue eare to the falshood of a weaker spirit: But for that manie crosse fortunes, maie hinder the happinesse of the most honorable resolutions, let me intreat your patience to make triall of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Prince nothing disliking this good motion in her good minde, kissing her hande, made this kinde conclusion: Faire Princesse, the discretion of your good motion, I exceedingly like of; for your credit to my truth, I cannot but thanke you, for the honour wherewith you entitle me, I returne it fully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vpon you, for the nature of my loue, let your vertue discerne it, and for the faith of my affection, I vow you shall command it: but as you know I haue resolutely intended to attende the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in his warres against the Turke, where if I gaine honor, the garlandd shall bee graced in your wearing; if I die, let it suffice thy selfe to knowe the honour of my loue, with, whome howsoeuer be my fortune, I vow to leaue the faith of my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and so, thinking to procéede in their further conference, spying certaine Ladies, and Gentlewomen with their friends and attendants comming into the garden, they singled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues one from another, hee retiring himselfe to his lodging, and she to her close arbour, where I leaue them for a while to meditate vpon their muses, and I will returne vnto <hi>

began thus to salute her. Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The Ladie not making anie shewe of disdaine, with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest smile made him this answere. Truth néedeth no eloquence; for your kinde offer of your seruice, I wish you a better prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but if I should be so vaine as to trust you, wherein would you giue mee leaue to commande you? The gentleman with this sweet seeming speech halfe perswaded of nothing lesse then her fauour, with all humblenes fell into protestations so far of his affection, that if he disobeied her command, or not fulfilled her request, let him die with his ill fortune, or bee disgraced in her fauour: whereupon with great thankes she made him this answeare. Syr, for that finding the greatnes of your good wil, I would not bee thought vnkinde in my requit all, marke well what I saie vnto you. You shall neither drawe your purse for a penny, your sword against an enimy, nor your foote from this place, so that you shall be neither at cost, in feare, nor danger for me, and yet performe my request, and you shall bee assured of my fauour.</p>
            <p>The gentleman fearing that she had mocked him with some matter of small importance, made her this answere. Madame though by the slightnes of this seruice, I feare the weaknes of my fortune, yet expresse your commandement, and consider of my desert: for be it hard or easie, I will either die or do it. Then (quoth the Princesse) without further talke, you see yonder is a diall vpon the wall of my fathers window: you see the shadow vpon the diall, stand here till you see the shadow moue, and then call me to the sight of it, I desire no more for your seruice.</p>
            <p>The poore gentleman there bound by his oth to performe his protestation, fell to stare out his e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If I should thinke that you could not dissemble, I should thinke you lacked wit, and if I shoulde trust you without triall, you might
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10212:22"/>
condemne me of follie, but if in regard of your protestations I should make proofe of your affection, might I presume of your performance, in making proofe of your sufficiencie.</p>
            <p>The poore man as proude of his hope, as his vnhappy friend, would refuse nothing, make no exceptions, but command and it was doone, or let it cost him his life: whereupon to abridge the tediousnes of their discourse, the put him to this péece of seruice. Sir (quoth shee) you see this Apple-tree before you, I praie you watch the ripening of them, the heate of the Sun I heare will change their colour, and fill them full of redde streakes, I praie you when you see them begin to change coloure call me, that I maie see it, and I will require no more seruice for the assurance of my fauour.</p>
            <p>The poore gentleman sworne to his taske, tooke him to his worke; where losse of his labour could get him nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: but in that gazing maze he had not stood long, but the thirde followed his fellowes, whome after much néedles talke, shée put likewise to this seruice. Sir (quoth shée) I am easilie perswaded that vpon easie pointes you woulde performe an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie péece of seruice, but had I neede of your helpe in any matter of difficultie, I maie perhaps faile of your performaunce: hee poore man as well deceiued as the rest, in the pride of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, making the worlde but a walke, the seaes but a brooke, and wonders but trifles, in respect of that which he would do for her, receiued this commandement for his emploiment. Sir (quoth shée) you see here this tufte of grasse, watch the shooting of any one of them, and call me that I maie see the growing of them: and it is all the seruice, that I meane to put you to for all the fauour that I can afforde you.</p>

But while they were thus standing either in muses or mazes returned the Duke into the garden, where marueyling to beholde those gallantes in those tunes, hauing heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause told his daughter, it would be some disgrace to her greatnes to offer such discourtesies, as to charge her seruantes with impossibilities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet smiling at their follies,

desiring her to rolease them, which she soone granted: he called <hi>Rantifo</hi> vnto him not far off walking with a gentleman of his chamber; to whome being come before him, being disposed to be merrie with him, tolde him of his danghters handling of her sutors: but (quoth he) let me intreate thee not to make report of this qualitie in her, least it bee a hurt to her great happinesse, when such as maie be worthie her fauour, maie take dislike at her vnkindnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rantifo</hi> not a little pleased to sée her so put off her gallant sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and yet much discomforted in conceit of his departure, told the Duke, that such trials of her wit, would encrease the titles of her honour; and for himselfe, he would not wish to liue, but to honour the roialtie of his house: which the Duke séeming to take verie well at his handdes, after a fewe ordinarie Courte words, leauing his daughter with her friends and attendants, in the garden, retired himselfe into his chamber and so into his closet: where I will leaue him for a while, at his study, and his danghter in the garden faine into some talke with her seruant, wherof I will speake hereafter, and I will returne to tell you what followed of <hi>Penillo</hi> and his fortune.</p>
            <p>In this time of <hi>Penillo</hi> his being vpon the sea, comming from the Emperours Court, he met with a shippe going for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino</hi> the chiefe cittie of his countrey, and in the shippe found one <hi>Mario Doronte,</hi> the Merchant that first brought ouer <hi>Rantifo,</hi> the Duke <hi>Ordilloes</hi> sonne into that countrey, of whom, making the shippe a while to attend him, after that hee had enquired of him of the health of the Duke <hi>Ordillo,</hi> and his faire daughter the Princesse his mistris, writing a few humble lines to his father, with a token of kindnesse to his sister, giuing somewhat to the sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But ere I go anie further with the discourse of their fortunes, I will leaue them for a while, and returne to <hi>Penillo,</hi> the Duke <hi>Feronte</hi> his sonne.</p>
            <p>This gallant young Prince was no sooner landed at the coast of the Ilandes, but with great rosaltie hee was attended, and with great loie welcomed to the Court, where, how his nustris reiosced let the hearts of true louers conceius, for I can not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse: but let it suffice that, though both their contents met in one coniunction, yet fortune the sworne enemie to all felicitie, fell now to deuise crosses to their comforts: for not long had he béene there making merie with his faire mistris, but the Duke his father hauing by the decaied Merchant receiued a letter of his sonnes making toward those Ilands, whither he was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to send <hi>Rantifo</hi> vpon a discontentiue message, wrote a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

But I wil leaue him vpon his tourny homewards for a while, and returne againe to <hi>Rantifo,</hi> who was sent embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour to his owne father.</p>

               <hi>Rantifo</hi> being now come to the Ilandes, and so to the Court of <hi>Ordillo,</hi> at his first comming was honourably entertained, but after the deliuerie of his message, not so kindlie welcome, yet whether for feare of a further mischiefe, or hope of vnlooked for kindnes, all discontentment was concealed, and he brought vnto the Duke, who setting his eie well vpon him, began in himselfe to finde some what in his aspect that did so much content him, that his embassage did not so dislike him, but his presence did much more please him: wherupon he gaue commandement to haue him well lodged and to his place in all duties entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

Her vnknowne brother, not minding yet to be knowne, replied againe, Madame, your selfe is the grace of all the good that I speake of: and if you would let me flatter you with particulars I would tell you as much as you alreadie knowe; but if the worde of a stranger maie go currant in your Court, will you vouthsafe my seruice the fauour of your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment?

            <p>The Page with a great sigh at his brothers absence, but more agrieued at the discord of the two Dukes, with her eies readie to shedde teares, made her this humble answere: Good Madam, shall I humblie begge this fauour at your hands, that you will vouchsafe to keepe secret, what I will commit vnto the onelie care of your honourable kindnes, wherein you maie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saue my life, or procure my death?

Then good Madam, answered the Princesse, I will tell you a strange yet true tale: The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour that seemeth to bee your louer, is your brother, sonne to the Duke your father, his name is <hi>Fantiro,</hi> sought to be slaine by a murtherer hired there to by your vncle lately dead, but to saue his life sought by the malice of your vngodly vncle, was deliuered vnto the decated Merchant <hi>Mario,</hi> who brought him as a Page to our Court, I meane the Court of <hi>Feronte,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Balino</hi> my father; whose daughter I am brought ouer in this habit that you sée, onlie to come to the sight of your brother my onlie beloued Lord on this earth. Your brother for my loue, was by a wretch in our Court wrought hither to this embassage, but such was his cariage in our Court, as from his first setling foote into fauour, he dailie encreased it, by his much well deseruing; so that there was no man of good spirit, but lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

him, and were sorrie to part with him, and for my affection to him, let my trauaile witnesse my truth: Nowe for the loue that in nature you beare your brother, for the kindnes that you maie finde requited in my brother, for the honor that you beare vnto loue, and for the loue that you beare vnto honour; let me humblie beseech you to conceale my follie, and in what you may to be a friend to my affection.</p>
            <p>The Princesse with a modest blush smiling at her discourse, made her this kinde and gratious answere: Sister, for so will I loue thee and estéeme thee, as I cannot be happy in any thing vnder heauen, but in thy brothers loue, which I holde as déere as my life, so if my brother doe not in all honourable seruice ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requite or deserue this thy kindnesse, I protest to renounce him for my brother, and detest him as mine enemie: be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of good chéere, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And thus will I leaue them togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their kinde talke, and I will tell you a little of the Duke <hi>Feronte,</hi> and his sonne.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>Feronte,</hi> in no little rage to thinke of the losse of his daughter, notwithstanding that he had heard his sonnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his Roiall entertainment, followed on his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for his intended warre against the Duke <hi>Ordillo,</hi> where his embassadour was too well to returne, and his faire daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was taken loues prisoner, and therefore calling his sonne before him vsed these wordes vnto him: <hi>Penillo,</hi> I haue made thee acquainted with my resolution for my reuenge of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wrong, that I haue receiued of <hi>Ordillo;</hi> out of whose countrey, I will fetch my fond daughter thy vnhappie sister, either dead or aliue, and therefore prepare thy selfe to put off all conceit of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and gaine the encrease of my loue, by the honour that thou shalt get vpon mine enemie.</p>
            <p>The young Prince, sorie to haue such cause to carrie armes against the father of his faire mistris, and yet vnwilling to be disobedient to his father, though it were the aduenture of his death, did humblie frame him this answere: My Gratious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I would be loath to disswade you from your setled resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10212:28"/>
but yet let me tell you, that although loue hath in my sister wrought a follie, shall the malice of a wicked spirit so poison your eare, that such a furie possesse your heart, that no sparke of patience can haue place in your conceit? It will bee thought to the greatest part of your Court, yea and almost to your whole countrey, that <hi>Signor Sperto</hi> hath béene the kindler of all this fire, and the bréeder of all these warres: I wonder not a little that your Grace coulde endure to heare of his presumption, in making loue to my sister; who I thinke bee rather runne into another countrey to trie the fortune of her affection, then to liue at home to abide the vnfitting suite of so ilfauoured a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: whom, but that he hath the name of a man, if I did not the better know him, I should surelie take for a monster. But if I maie begge so much fauour of your Grace, as to grant me my humble suite, I beséech you beginne iustice at home, and I hope we shall prosper the better abroad: Let <hi>Sperto</hi> in regard of his malicious practise against a stranger, and presumption in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the patience of your daughter, be openlie called before you, reprehended for his follie, and banished your Court for his offence, and I doubt not but your maiestie shall sée the venome of his vile nature droppe out in his right kinde, my sister hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie returned to your good fauour, and your warres turne to such a peace, as all that loue you shall be glad of. I speake not this like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince of <hi>Pigmeies</hi> that should be affraid of Cranes, but that I will attend you in your warres, where I hope an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable triumph will be better then a bloudie conquest: but fall what will, I will not liue but to bee obedient to your loue: and therefore will be readie, when it shall please you to attende you.</p>
            <p>The Duke not a little noting the good counsaile of his discréet sonne, willing his son to be in readines, against a daie shortlie after appointed him, caused <hi>Sig. Sperto</hi> forthwith to be brought before him, to whome with a sterne countenance he vsed this spéech: <hi>Sperto,</hi> I haue long giuen eare to thine vnsuspected sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie, but of late hauing sounded the reach of thy conceit, I will laie open thy cunning: in the time of <hi>Rantifoes</hi> being in our Courte, thou couldest neuer cease to ring in mine eares some

couse of dislike in him, which I tooke well at thy handes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of thy imagined care of my good; but nowe I finde the ground of thy vngratious working grewe from the malicious feare in thee, of his fauour from my faire daughter, whom thy vnworthie selfe wouldst haue bewitched w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wicked eloquence, let me tell thée, for that I haue in some occasions of importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, made good vse of thy seruice, thou shall not be vnregarded, for I will make thee receiuer of my customes: but for thy saucines with my swéete daughter, driuen out of our countrey by thy dogged meanes, I will out of hande, haue thee made an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But leauing thus the wicked wretch to his wofull end, and the furious Duke in his inerorable anger, procéeding onwards with his warres: I will tell you a fewe wordes of the two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <hi>Merilla</hi> and <hi>Bilanta,</hi> the imagined page that I left tog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The Ladie <hi>Bilanta,</hi> after she had secretlie conferred with the Ladie <hi>Merilla,</hi> touching both their loues, minding to make her selfe merrie with a prettie conceit, after that they had past a night or two in priuat talke togither how to bring all matters about to their best contentment, sent for the embassadour her brother, in all kindnesse spéedelie to come to her; who no sooner receiued the message, but laying all businesse apart, came to his sister, whom he then called mistris, little thinking indeed to haue found his true beloued, and louing mistris so neere. But being come into her lodging and well entred into her chamber, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding apart all her attendantes, shee thus fell into talke with him.</p>
            <p>Seruant, though perhaps it maie séeme immodestie in a

Uirgin of my sort to giue such entertainment to a stranger of what sort soeuer he maie be, as I am perswaded your honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kindnesse will deserue; yet let me entreat you one fauour to tell me without dissembling, if I am the first obiect of your dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest affection, or whether you neuer haue had anie mistris that you haue helde anie especiall account of, and hath worthilie had the promise of your loue? Truely Madame answered her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as hee thought vnknowne to her, I must confesse I had a mistris whom I so deerely loued, and so duelie serued, that had I anie possible hope to enioie the fruit of her fauour, I shoulde hate my selfe in the loue of anie other, but shee being so farre from the comfort of all such conceit, I thinke it no dishonour to my loue, to doe seruice to the vertue that I finde in you: for if I coulde be so vile as to thinke you a base thought death bee the rewarde of my desire, and to presume further in the best na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of honour, then maie stande with your good fauour, might condemne mee of follie, and perhaps ouerthrowe my fortune, but in such good termes to doe you seruice as maie please you to accept, I thinke it a duetie in Chiualrie: but for my mistris I protest had you euer seene and knowne her, you would haue thought as much good of her as I do, and wish her as much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse as I want.</p>
            <p>The Ladie smiling at this answere, would néedes know her name, and whence she was: who tolde her that she was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie daughter of his master the Duke <hi>Feronte,</hi> her name was <hi>Merilla,</hi> and she was the likest vnto the Page that she lately had from the Merchant, that euer she sawe: Well (quoth the Lady) no longer my Lord embassadour, but déere brother, I am glad to sée thee heere, for thou art my brother, and that shall my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowe ere long: thy mistris is more worthie of honour, then our whole countrey and thy life can giue her: and with that worde, Page quoth she to the Ladie <hi>Merilla,</hi> I praie thée take thy lute and play and sing thy wish: which she being in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vnséene by meanes of a curtein of Crimsin damaske drawn betwixt them, tooke her lute and plaied a note to a dittie, which she sung as followeth.</p>

I must followe my father, to fall out with my friende: <hi>Ordillo</hi> vsed me like himselfe, and shall I be vngratefull, in the greatest vnkindnesse? but <hi>Bilanta</hi> my loue, what will she thinke of my faith, to she we such fruites of my affection?

Your fortune is like your quarrell, no better then I wish, and as it beginneth, so I hope will bee the ende: disgrace at the first, thinke what will bee the last. Well (quoth <hi>Penillo</hi>) I am nowe not my selfe, had not fortune thus throwne me into thy handes, thou wouldest neuer haue dared to haue vttered one of these wordes; and had I my libertie, I would make thee shake for this presumption.
