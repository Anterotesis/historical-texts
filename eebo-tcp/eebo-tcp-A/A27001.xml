            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Suppoſe thou wilt marvell that I trouble my ſelf with ſo wilde a Generation as the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> are; or that I trouble thee with a few haſty lines which I wrote on ſuch an Occaſion; I'le truly tell thee the cauſe of both: <hi>1.</hi> They ſent me five ſeverall Papers, one of them containing the Queries which I anſwer, and others of them almoſt nothing but abundle of filthy railing words, <hi>[Thou Serpent, thou Liar, thou deceiver, thou childe of the devil, thou curſed hypocrite, thou dumb dogge]</hi> with much more of the like. They choſe out one day, when it pleaſed God to confine me to my Chamber by ſickneſse, to come into our Aſsembly, and after Morning Sermon to fall a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning the Preacher, my aſſistant; and becauſe he avoided publike diſputing with them at that ſeaſon, as not taking it for a profitable ſpending of the Lords day, they call him <hi>the hireling that flieth,</hi> it ſeems referring <hi>to</hi> Joh. <hi>10. 12.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45242:3"/>
and ſo confeſsing themſelves to be the Wolves. I finde that they do ſo challenge, and brag, and triumph, if we ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them, and that too many ſimple people expect that we ſhould anſwer them, that (after an unprofitable verball diſcourſe with an unreaſonable railing fellow) I reſolved to ſend them this brief anſwer to their Questions: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they abhorre Syllogiſmes and diſputings, I was fain to deale further with them in their own questioning way: I had before offered to come and anſwer all their Queries in their Aſsembly, if they would conſent that I might do it without diſturbance; But inſtead of permitting that, they denied it, and ſent me a Letter of Reviling, calling me ever and over Serpent and Hypocrite, and the like Names, and commanding me in the Name of the moſt High God to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Questions in writing, that they might print them with their reply; ſo that if I ſay nothing they will inſult; If I write to them they will print it: Being therefore ſo far called to ſpeak, I choſe rather to print my own Papers, how mean ſoever, then let them do it.</p>
            <p>Two Objestions I foreſee will be raiſed againſt me; One is, that the Perſons are ſo contemptible and the errours ſo groſse, that it's a needleſse work to ſtrive againſt them; To which I ſay, Let ſad experience witneſse, whether it be needleſſe; when they ſo much multiply, and ſo many where they come are preſently infected. The ſalvation of the pooreſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is ſo far from being contemptible, that it is worth much more then our greateſt diligence. <hi>2.</hi> It will be ſaid, it is but the Churches of the Separatiſts and Anabaptiſts that are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied by theſe Seducers; and it's best even let them alone to keep their own Flocks, and ſecure their Churches, or if they fall off it may ſhew others the tendency of their waies, and ſo pervent their turning aſide; To which I anſwer: 1. Though the ſtream of Apostates be ſuch as firſt were Anabaptists or
<pb facs="tcp:45242:3"/>
Separatiſts, yet here and there one of the young unſetled ſort do fall into that ſtream that were not before of them, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps inclining to them, and ſo do ſome few that had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſneſs. 2. I had farre rather that men continued Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists and Anabaptiſts, then turned Quakers or plain A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates; And therefore would do all that I can to hinder ſuch an emptying of their Churches as tendeth to the more certain filling of Hell; It's better to ſtop them in a condition where we may have ſome hope of their ſalvation, then to let them run into certaine perdition; I did therefore take it to be my duty when theſe poor neighbours who had before been A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts, Separatiſts, and ſome Seekers, had turned Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, to offer them a verbal anſwer to all their vain Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that I might have had ſo much opportunity to undeceive them; When they refuſed that, and ſaid, they would not be drawn into a Serpents ſnare, I thought best to ſend them my Anſwer in writting, committing it to ſome of their Neighbours, that they might deſire leave to reade it in their Aſsembly; And when I heard that they would not grant that neither (for all their inſulting adjuring of us to anſwer them) but talkt of Printing ſomething against me, I choſe rather to tell the world of theſe Paſſages between us, then leave them to their reports; eſpecially hearing how they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in <hi>London</hi> and other parts, and that the ignorant have need of ſome plain Information to prevent their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy and perdition in this temptation.</p>

            <head>TO THE Separatiſts and Anabaptiſts IN England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough Gods minde be moſt plainly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in his written Word, yet are his Providences alſo teaching, and it is the duty of his Servants to reade and ſtudy them, eſpecially the Poenall withdrawing or withholding of his grace, and giving men up to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve lies, and to vile affections, to a reprobate ſence, and to an abominable converſation, theſe are ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the ſore diſpleaſure of the Moſt High, as ſhould make even the beholders to fear, and all that ſtand but near to this heavy judgement to fly away from it, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did at the cries of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious followers of <hi>Corah,</hi> Num. 16. leſt the earth ſhould have ſwallowed them up alſo: I am not of their minde that make light of the ſtrange Providences in our mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary affairs and changes of State, though I think every carnal admirer of them doth not underſtand them: But it's a matter of very ſad conſideration, that many of vhoſe ſame men that ſeem ſo much to magnifie theſe, do no more obſerve, underſtand, and lay to heart the more remarkable Providence of our heavy ſpirituall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments!
<pb facs="tcp:45242:4"/>
The overlooking of theſe Providences makes many fear leſt it be but their own intereſt which they ſtudy in the other, and leſt by reading themſelves and their own Names where they ſhould reade God, they turn this light into darkneſſe or ſeduction, and by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting on this Feaſt do contract thoſe diſeaſes that are like to be their bane; What is Gods Word for but to make himſelf and our duty known to us? And ſo he doth very much by his Works, where we may ſee his Nature, and ſomething of his Approbation or diſlike, eſpecially as they are read by the help of the Word. Certainly God is known by the judgement which he executeth: (ſpecially when) the <hi>wicked is ſnared in the work of his own hands,</hi> Pſa. 9. 16. The hand of God is apparently gone out againſt your waies of Separation and Anabaptiſm: It is your duty to obſerve it: You may ſee you do but prepare too many for a further progreſſe, Seekers, Ranters, Familiſts, and now Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and too many profeſſed Infidels, do ſpring up from among you, as if this were your Journeys end, and the perfection of your Revolt. And it is your Churches and thoſe that lean toward you that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive the Doctrines of the deceiver, and are the ſtream in which ſome others with them are carried away. You may ſee you cannot hold your followers when you have them; Your work is blaſted, You la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain, nay, worſe then in vain; You do but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men for flat Hereſie and Apoſtacy; I have heard yet from the ſeverall parts of the Land, but of very few that have drunk in this venome of the Ranters or Quakers, but ſuch as have firſt been of your opinions, and gone out at that door; The reſt are but here and there a young perſon that was not noted for any great
<pb facs="tcp:45242:5"/>
matter of Religiouſneſſe, or only liked it and inclined to your waies; And if any others be ſeduced, the evil ariſeth from among you, and from your Graduats do they receive their taint, as yours do from the Papiſts and the great Deceiver. Is it your Miniſtry or ours that they bend their force againſt? Is it not part of their preſent buſineſſe to do your work, and cry down In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm? One of the Queres which they here put to me is [What expreſſe Scripture I have for Infant Baptiſm? which I muſt ſhew without conſequences or elſe confeſſe my ſelf a falſe Prophet:] And another ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to prove us no true Churches: The Quakers then are Separatiſts and Antipaedobaptiſts, though more: I ſpeak not this to reproach you, but to minde you of the tendency of all your endeavours, that you may ſeriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly as before the Lord conſider, whether he do not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from Heaven againſt you and your waies, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up your followers to ſuch abominations as ſince the daies of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> the Sun hath not ſeen, at leaſt ſo openly and commonly owned. Have you well conſidered into what your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties were reſolved in <hi>Germany</hi> and other parts? And do you well conſider what fruits they here bring forth, and now likely they are to be ſhortly quite corrupted, if a ſpeedy ſtop be not made? and what it is that you have done to the Church of God, and how much it is beholden to you for the proſperity of truth and piety. Is it like to be Gods way which ſo ordinarily leadeth to end endeth in ſuch deſperate evils? I make not this my firſt or chief argument againſt you, but it's a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſecond, and ſhould make wiſe men at leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of ſuch a courſe: Nor would I thus argue from the Apoſtacy of a few, or upon ſome unuſuall accident;
<pb facs="tcp:45242:5"/>
but when ſuch hath been the Fate of the ſtream of your party, from the very firſt riſing of them in the world to this day, I think it not inconſiderable. Nor would I thus argue from any temporall judgement or oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a perſecuting Enemy; for I know that is no ſuch ſigne of Gods diſpleaſure: But if I ſuſpect whether thoſe perſons are in a way pleaſing to God, whom I ſee him ſo uſually deliver up to Satan, I hope I may be excuſed. Certainly Gods Churches are the places of his Bleſſing and his Delight: And certainly ſuch ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall plagues as our eyes now behold, are as evident Notes of Gods heavy diſpleaſure as men can expect to ſee on earth. And we have the more reaſon yet to be ſuſpicious that this is Gods diſowning of your way, and Teſtimony from heaven againſt it, in that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the firſt Hereticks, the Simonians and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, with the ſame kinde of judgements, and by ſuch fearful deſertions, did then witneſſe his deteſtation of thoſe that withdraw from the Unity of his Church.</p>
            <p>And it is very remarkable, that it is a pretence of our Impurity and of a greater purity with you, that is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe that firſt turn over to you, and that this height of all impieties ſhould be the uſuall iſſue of a way pretended ſo exact and clean: Doubtleſſe it is none of Gods minde by this to diſcourage any from Purity and true Reformation, but to ſhew his Deteſtation of that ſpirituall pride which makes men have too high thoughts of themſelves, and too much to contemn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to deſire to be further ſeparated from them then God in the Day of grace doth allow of; Where the Tares (of ungodly men) are ſuch as cannot be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up and caſt out of the Church, without danger of pulling up and caſting out ſome of the Wheat, even the
<pb facs="tcp:45242:6"/>
weakeſt true Believers with them, there God would; have us let both grow together till the time of harveſt But theſe proud men will ſtand at a further diſtance, and will diſlike Gods gracious cealings with ſinners, and their eye is evil becauſe he is good; and they will not grow in the ſame Field (or Church) where ſuch Tares do grow, but will tranſplant themſelves and remove from the field becauſe God will not pluck up the Tares, (eſpecially if any Miniſterial neglect of Diſcipline be conjoyned as too commonly it is:) and in ſtead of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their own pride, and miſunderſtanding of Gods merciful dealings with ſinners, they lay the blame on the corruption of the Church, and call it <hi>A Field of Tares</hi> and not of Wheat: In one word, it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that ſpiritual Pride doth turn moſt men from us to you, and that this is the very ſinne that undoes ſuch a multitude of Profeſſors of Religiouſneſs, and which hath let in all Gods Judgements upon us, and the ſinne which he is now witneſſing againſt from Heaven. As none more like to Chriſt then the humble that are mean in their own eyes and compaſſionate to others; ſo none are more like to the devil then the proud, that think highly of themſelves and contemptuouſly of others; And the better the thing is that they are proud of, the worſe is their pride in this reſpect, that it is the ſetting up of Gods pretious mercies againſt him, and the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Satans houſe with Chriſts materials: The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees Liturgy is of too frequent uſe in the Separated Congregations <hi>[I thank thee O God that I am not as other men are,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nor even as this Publicane.]</hi> He that maketh us to differ from other men, and expecteth thanks for his differencing grace, doth yet abhorre a proud oſtentaiton of it, and a diminutive eſteem of his
<pb facs="tcp:45242:6"/>
ſmalleſt mercies unto others, and all proud deſires that they ſhould be thruſt below us further then he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: It is the good of ſinners, and the honour of God that is the end of diſcipline, and not that we might perſonally be extolled and judged of above what is meet.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have peruſed your Requeſt, and am glad that you are not ſo confirmed in your miſery, but that you will yet ask advice of your Friend; I pray God you be ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and happy as to take it: It is a very ſad thing to me and ſhould be ſo much more to you, to think that after ſo much pains as you have taken in duty, and ſo much zeal as you have profeſsed for God, you ſhould yet be ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the will and Word of God, and Chriſt ſhould have ſo little intereſt in your heart, as that ſuch horrid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian doctrines and practices ſhould be ſo eaſily enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by you, and ſo far approved of: I marvell why you took it for ſo great a work of grace to convert you from
<pb facs="tcp:45242:7"/>
prophaneſse, and now will take it for a greater work to convert you to it again, or to much worſe? Was it not the ſame Ordinances that you deſpiſed before Converſion, which you now much more deſp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe? Was it not the ſame Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that thou you ſcorn'd whom ye now reproach with far greater bitterneſse (if you do as thoſe whom you pleade for do?) Is it not the ſame Christians whom you then derided, and now revile at, and condemn as Children of the devil: O miſerable man! Is all your hearing and praying come to this? Dare you meet the Meſsengers of Chriſt in the face, and tell them they are Liars and deceivers? Dare you caſt out the holy worſhip of Chriſt as falſe worſhip, and ſeek to draw people into the contempt of it? Dare you damn thoſe Churches and millions of Saints that Chriſt hath bought with his precious bloud? Dare you ſeek to draw men to hate their Teachers whom Chriſt hath ſet over them, and to hate his people as if they were the Children of the Devil, and to hate his worſhip and holy waies? Alas that ever a man in his wits ſhould look upon ſuch abominations as amiable, and much more that any man ſhould be ſo mad as to do this under the Name and profeſsion of a Chriſtian! That you can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the furious oppoſition to the whole Army of Christ, his Officers, Church and Ordinances, can yet be a work that Christ accepteth: That you ſhould no better know Chriſts work from Satans, nor know that it is the Dragon whoſe warfare theſe men do manage? I muſt needs profeſſe that it is a very grievous thing in mine eyes, that after all our pains with mens ſouls, and after the rejoycings which we had in their ſeeming converſion, and zealous lives, we ſhould yet ſee ſo much ignorance, levity, and giddineſse of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, as that they are ready to entertain the moſt horrid abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations! That the devil can no ſooner bait his hook, but they greedily catch at it, and ſwallow it without chewing;
<pb facs="tcp:45242:7"/>
yea, nothing ſeems too groſse for them, but ſo it ſeems Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty all goes down. I am afraid if they go a little further, they will beleeve him that ſhall ſay, The Devil is God, and to be worſhiped and obeyed. Shall I freely tell you whence all this comes? Even from h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lliſh pride of heart: You ſee it not (it's like) in your ſelf or in them, but I ſhall endeavour to make you ſee it both in your ſelves and them. For your ſelves you confeſse to me that you have long thought that Infant-Baptiſm was an errour, and that now you think the Quakers are in the right; and yet you neither did once reade any one of thoſe Books which we have written to prove Infant-Baptiſm to be a duty, nor did once ſcriouſly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially lay open your doubts to your Teacher, nor ask his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as if you were even then too good to enquire, and would venture your ſoul to ſave you a little labour, yet are you now confident that you are in the right, and he and all of his minde are in the wrong. You know you are a young man, and have had little opportunity to be acquainted with the Word of God, in compariſon of what your Teacher hath had: If you preſume that you are ſo much more beloved of God then he, that God will reveal that to you without ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtudy, which upon the greatest diligence he will not reveal to him; what can this conceit proveed from but pride? God commandeth study and meditating day and night in his Laws; Your Teacher hath ſpent twenty, if not an hundred hours in ſuch Meditation where you have ſpent one: He hath ſpent twenty if not an hundred hours in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God for his ſpirit of Truth and Grace, where you have ſpent one: His prayers are as earneſt as yours: His life is much more holy and heavenly then yours; His Office is to teach, and therefore God is as it were more engaged to be his Teacher, and to make known his Truth to him th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n to you; Is it not then apparent pride for you to be confident
<pb facs="tcp:45242:8"/>
that you are ſo much wiſer then he, and that you are ſo much more lovely in Gods eyes, that he will admit you more in to the knowledge of his Mysteries, then thoſe that have better uſed his own appointed means to know them? and for you, in ignorance to run about with the Shell on your head, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the world of the ignorance of your late Teachers? I ſay not that you do ſo; But the Quakers whom you approve of do ſo, and much more.</p>
            <p>I pray you tell me, Did you ever ſtudy well what <hi>Paul</hi> meant. <hi>

                  </gap> Tim. 3. 5.</hi> where he requireth that he that is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ſhould <hi>[not be a Novice, leſt being lifted up with pride he fall into the Condemnation of the devil;]</hi> The Word tranſlated a <hi>Novice</hi> ſignifieth a New Plant, a late Convert, or new or young Chriſtian; You ſee here that ſuch are in moſt danger of being lifted up with pride, and why ſo? but becauſe <hi>1.</hi> They have not yet knowledge enough to acquaint them with their ignorance and great weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>2.</hi> Nor have they yet grown to a juſt degree of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and other eſtabliſhing preſerving graces; You ſee alſo that to fall into Pride, is to fall into the condemnation of the devil. You know ſure that it is no wrong to you to ſay that you are but a Novice or raw Chriſtian, for it is but a few years ſince you came out of utter ignorance and carnality; and therefore that you have reaſon to be very watchfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ſin, yea, by the evidence that you give in againſt your ſelves, you might ſee that you are too farre enſnared in it already.</p>
            <p>And for the Quakers, you are blinde if you ſee not their horrible Pride; You'le perhaps think it strange that Pride ſhould be the very Maſter-ſinne in them that go in ſo poor a garb, and cry out against Pride ſo zealouſly as they do; and go up and down the world, as if they were ſent from Heaven to perſwade men to wear no Lace, or Cuffs, or Points,
<pb facs="tcp:45242:8"/>
and that down ſo many Ministers for being called <hi>Maſters.</hi> But alas do you not know that Pride of inward qualifications commonly called ſpiritual <hi>Pride,</hi> is the moſt killing and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable! the better the thing is that you are proud of, the worſe is your Pride. O what a brave thing doth it ſeem in theſe mens eyes, that they ſhould ſeem to be poſseſsed with ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpirit as can trample upon worldly glory, and can boiſterouſly contemn all that are not of their ſect, and that can deſpiſe Dignities, and be equall with the greateſt: yea, that only they ſhould have this admirable ſpirit, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others are the Children of the Devil, and under their feet: Though other men ſhould never ſo much ſl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eght them, yet do they wonderfully pleaſe themſelves with theſe high thoughts of themſelves; For Pride is firſt an overvaluing of a mans ſelf, and thinking of himſelf above what is meet, and then a deſire that others ſhould do ſo by him too.</p>
            <p>If yet you ſee not the pride of theſe men, I will ſhew it you in theſe four particular Evidences, and that ſo plainly, that if you know the difference between the language of heaven and of hell, you may eaſily perceive the devil ſpeaking by their mouths. <hi>1.</hi> They affirm themſelves to be perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin (yea, ſome of them ſay they are Chriſt and God.) And is it poſsible that any man in this life, that is not mad with ſpiritual pride, can indeed believe that he hath no ſin? what? that he tranſgreſseth no Law? That he doth love God in the highest degree that he is bound to do? That he never hath a thought or word that is ſinful, nor ſinfully loſeth one minute of his time? Yea, and this when in the eyes and ears of the wiſest, they foam out their own ſhame, as the raging Sea doth cast out the dirt. The devil himſelf hath either leſse pride or leſse ignorance, then to think himſelf to be perfect without ſin; If they have no ſin, what need they pray, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins,</hi> or what further need have they of the bloud
<pb facs="tcp:45242:9"/>
of Chriſt or his Interceſsion to procure them any further for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs? If you can ſee no pride in this, I fear you are blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them to destruction.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> And is it not apparent pride in them to ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo far above all the people of God on earth? yea, to vilifie the moſt holy and eminent Servants of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all the Churches in the world, as if heaven were made for them alone (if it were ſo well, that all of them did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve a heaven beſides that within them, which I ſuppoſe is but a ſorry heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> And yet more unmatchable pride and impious Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is it, to damn all the Church and people of God for this <hi>1600</hi> years at leaſt. Indeed God had never a people on earth of theſe mens way: But (to let paſse the Scripture ages which condemn them) tell me, Had Chriſt any Church ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles daies till now, or not? If he had not, then he was no head of the Church, and ſo no Christ: For there is no head without a body: If he had a Church tell us, where it was, and when? Do you not know (if you know any thing of the ſtate of the Church for <hi>1600</hi> Years) that Chriſt had no Church on earth of the Quakers minde, and that all his Miniſters have been ſuch as they condemn, and have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by as honourable Titles as they are now? And is not that man either an Infidel and enemy to Chriſt, or ſtark mad with pride, that can believe that Chriſt had no Church till now, and that all the Miniſters of the Goſpel for <hi>1600</hi> years were the Miniſters of the devil (as they ſay of us that tread in their ſteps) and that all the Chriſtians of that <hi>1600</hi> Years are damned (at now they dare denounce against thoſe that ſucceed them,) and that God made the world, and Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, with a purpoſe to ſave none but a few Quakers that the world never knew till a few Years agoe; or at leaſt a few Hereticks that were their Predeceſſors of old.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:45242:9"/>
               <hi>4.</hi> And I ſhould ſuppoſe that their proud, ſcornful, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing language ſhould put it out of doubt what ſpirit they are of, to any that are acquainted with the language of Chriſts Spirit, and of Satan, and are able to judge of ſpirits by the most palpable effects, and to know darkneſse from light.</p>
            <p>But you ſay, It is Scripture-Language which they ſpeak: I anſwer, the greater is their preſumptuous ſin in making ſo ill a uſe of Scripture-Language, as to ſerve Satan by it, and uſe it to reviling; What if Chriſt call <hi>Judas</hi> a devil? Is it therefore lawfull to call <hi>Perer</hi> ſo, or any faithfull Servants of Chriſt? But I perceive you think they justly condemn us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are called <hi>Maſters of men,</hi> contrary to <hi>Matth. 23.</hi> Alas that a Chriſtian ſhould be ſo ignorant, as not to know that even calling Maſter and Lord too, is commonly allowed of in Scripture, and that it is not the Title but <hi>1.</hi> The proud affecting of the Title. <hi>2.</hi> And the Lording it over mens faith as Maſters of that (as if others muſt be of their minde right or wrong) which Chriſt there condemneth; Even as in the ſame place he forbiddeth being called <hi>Fathers,</hi> in the very ſame ſenſe, when yet it is frequently allowed in a better ſenſe. But for the fuller anſwering of theſe ſcruples of yours, and the reſt about Tithes, and ſuch like: I ſend you herewith, an Anſwer to the Queſtions of ſome Quakers near us in the Pariſh of <hi>Bromſgrove,</hi> and refer you to my <hi>Defence of the Worceſter ſhire Petition</hi> Printed ſome Years agoe.</p>
            <p>To your Queſtion, What I think of theſe men? I will tell you what I think and am paſt all doubt of.</p>
            <p>There are in <hi>England</hi> a Company of young raw Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors that have more zeal then knowledge; And there are a companie of carnal hypocrites that place all their Religion in holding certain Opinions, and uſing certain externall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſiding with a Religious partie. It is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to miſleade all theſe if they be not better guided by others
<pb facs="tcp:45242:10"/>
then by themſelves: While they have due regard to the Judgements of their Teachers that know more then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo live in a learning way till they have attained to better underſtanding, they may eſcape Deceivers; But if they are once brought to be wiſe enough in their own eyes, and to deſpiſe their Teachers, then they are like a man that hath loſt his way in a dark night, or that hath loſt his Guide in an unknown Wilderneſſe, or like a Dog that hath loſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and therefore will be ready to follow any body that firſt whiſtleth to him. The Papiſts and the devil know this well enough, and therefore their first endeavour is to unſettle theſe people, by taking them off all dependance on their guides, and that must be by bringing the Ministers into contempt with them; For if they could once accompliſh this fully, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the people from their Paſtors, and ſo aſſault the people alone, or with weak, and unlearned Teachers only, they might then eaſily bear down all before them; and one Popiſh Friar or Jeſuite would non-plus five hundred of our moſt famous Sectmaſters; They remember yet that it was the diſgracing of the Popiſh Clergy, partly by their own notorious ignorance and vitiouſneſs, and partly by our perſwading men that the Pope is Antichriſt, which was the main advantage which the Reformers had for the ruining of the Papall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; And therefore they would, partly in Policy, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Revenge, attempt the deſtruction of our Churches by the ſame means. Theſe Papiſts ſeeing the temper of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid unſetled Profeſsors do creep in among them, and uſe their utmoſt skill to unſettle them more, and bring them into diſlike of their Teachers, without which they have no hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; Their firſt waies are by reproaching the ſetled go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, and by drawing men to ſeparation and Anabaptiſm; and then perſwading them that theſe are glorious Truths of God, which their former Teachers are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:45242:10"/>
to receive, and that they are but a blinde, ſelf-ſeeking, proud ſort of men that would enthrall all men to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when they are in utter darkneſs themſelves: When they have gotten them but thus farre once, to deſpiſe their guides, then do they proceed further with them, and perſwade them that they that were blinde in the points of Baptiſm and Church-order, are ſo in other things as well as that, and that this light which they have ſeen already, is but a ſpark, and that theſe being daies of glorious diſcoveries, there are yet more and greater matters to be revealed. Hereupon they put a handſome dreſse upon many of the groſſeſt points of Popery, and recommend theſe as the new and rare diſcoveries. But this they do not in the Name and garb of Papiſts, but (as the Popiſh Jew at <hi>New-caſtle)</hi> they turn Anabaptiſts, and then riſe a ſtep higher, and leade others after them; ſo that the ſilly people ſhall never know that it is Papiſts that are their Leaders; yea, they will cry out of the Pope, and call all that differs from them Antichriſtian purpoſly to divert ſuſpicions, and blinde mens eyes. Thus theſe Papiſts have begotten this preſent Sect of Quakers; firſt pretending to ſtrange Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Viſions and Trances, ſuch as are commonly mentioned in the lives of their Saints in the Legends: And ſo you have here and there a Papiſt lurking to be the chief Speaker among them, and theſe have faſhioned many others to their turns, to ſupplie their rooms, who yet know not their own Fathers.</p>
            <p>And ſo the Quakers among us are [The ignorant, proud, giddie ſort of Profeſſors, firſt made Separatiſts or Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and perhaps more (for the moſt part of them) and then drawn futher by Popiſh ſubtlety, and now headed with ſome ſecret diſſembling Friars, and by them, and by the devil, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged againſt the Miniſters of Christ, and ſet upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of the ſubſtance of Popery.</p>
            <p>If You ask me, how I know that it is Papiſts who thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb facs="tcp:45242:11"/>
them? I anſwer, <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe they do the Papiſts work, and maintain their cauſe, as far as yet they dare venture to bring it forth; I could tell you of abundance of Popery that the Quakers and Behmenists maintain; As that the Pope is not Antichrist (which is at least to their advantage whether Popery or not) and the diſgracing and ſecret under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the ſufficiency of the Scripture, the decrying of the Miniſtry, the unchurching of our Churches, the ſlieghting of Juſtification by Imputed Righteouſneſſe, and drawing men to the admiration of their inherent righteouſneſse, and of their works, the crying up the light within us, and the ſufficiency of common revelation, the ſetting up the ſtrength of mans free-will, the aſserting the neceſsity of a Judge of Controverſie above Scripture (which they are content ſhould be the Spirit of Revelations a while, till they can boldlier exchange that for the Pope) the extolling of Monaſticall Community and Virginity, and alienation from worldly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiments, the doctrine of Perfection without ſinne in this life, with many more of the like nature: All this the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have taught the Quakers. If You ſay, They might learn it without them; I would ask you whether in all theſe great Points you think the Papiſts are righter then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches? If you ſay they be, ſpeak out, and confeſs your ſelf a Papist; If You ſay they be not, then who think you ſhould reveal all this Poperie to the Quakers; Not the Spirit of God, for he is not the Authour of Poperie or any falſhood; If it were the devil, then it ſeems that Poperie and the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Faith is hatched by the Prince of darkneſſe; And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were Frias or Devils, or both, that make Quakers, it's not worth the while to diſpute, as long as we know that it is Poperie that they hold, and the devil befriendeth it.</p>
            <p>Perhaps You will ſay, That they hold many certain Truths, they cry down Pride and Drunkenneſſe, and worldlineſſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:45242:11"/>
cry up Mortification, and Charitie, and Humilitie. I anſwer. And do not we do ſo as well as they? Theſe are Points where we are agreed with the Papiſts: Do You think that God would extraordinarily ſend theſe men to preach down the very ſame ſinnes which are commonly preacht down alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, better then they can do it, by thoſe men whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? All that is good among them, is only that which is as common among us, and I hope a little better maintained and managed; And all that wherein they differ from us is their Popiſh and heretical errours.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> But to give you further ſatisfaction, it is known by certain proof, that it is the Papiſts that do ſeduce and head them: Many of themſelves have confeſt ſuch things, and their preſent induſtrie among us is well known (which that they may proceed in with leſse impediment, they are the Zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Defendors of Univerſall Toleration, or Libertie for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating ſoul-poyſoning Doctrines, for all the torments of the Inquiſition in other Countreys.)

            <p>IF you further ask me, Why the Papiſts are ſo diligent in theſe kinde of works? I anſwer, Their Tyranicall Faction and Schiſm is maintained by works of darkneſſe and unconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable deceits; And they know in ſuch works as theſe they are not like to loſe their labour, they have ſo many ſeverall ends which they hope to attain; Some they may bring directly to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery it ſelf, Some they bring to a great part of Popery before they know where they are; All of them they procure to do their work in diſgracing the Miniſtry, and many of them in disparaging the Scripture: At leſt they know when men are looſened from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grounds, they are readier to receive a new Impreſſion; Alſo by this meanes they think to make the multitudes of Sects, and the madneſſe of them to be a ſhame to our Religion; And by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument they turn many others to their ſide: They uſe from hence to aſſault our common ungrounded Proteſtants, and ſay, You may ſee now what it is to depart from the Unity of the Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church (for ſo they will needs call their trancendant ſchiſm.) And when they talk among their own followers in <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and other Countreys, they mightily frem hence confirm them in their errours, and do ſo aggravate the Hireſiies and Sects among us which themſelves have cheriſhed, that they make the world abroad believe that the Proteſtants or Reformers in <hi>England</hi> are almoſt all run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtark mad, and even given over to the devil to poſſeſs and move and ſhake their bodies, and that we are broken into ſo many ſhreds and pieces, that we are almoſt <hi>So many men ſo many mindes,</hi> and have now no face of a Church among us, eſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the advantage of the ſuffrages of ſome few over-angry Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines among our ſelves, who (on another ground) comply with the Separatiſts, affirming that we have no true Churches, where there is not the Epiſcopal preheminence; You ſee then what game the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts play in their fomenting of their Sects, and what uſe they make of them at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45242:13"/>
To conclude, I entreat you to conſider well of the ſenſe of theſe paſſages in the holy Scriptures, <hi>Eph 4. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</hi> where you may ſee that Christs Officers or Miniſters are ſetled by him in his Church for the edification, unity, and <hi>(at laſt)</hi> the perfecting of the body, and the preſerving of the poor people from the ſnares of ſuch Seducers <hi>[that we henceforth be no more Children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every winde of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by the ſleight of men, and cunning craftineſſe, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.]</hi> Young unſetled Novices and proud ſelf-conceited Profeſſors and Opinioniſts are like a bundle of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers toſt up and down, and carried that way as the winde of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation driveth them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1 Cor. 11. 18, 19. [When ye come together in the Church, I here that there be diviſions among you, and I partly beleeve it; For there muſt be alſo Hereſies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifeſt among you:]</hi> I pray you mark here what Gods end is in permitting theſe Diviſions and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies among us? They are the winde that muſt ſift us and ſhew us which was the wheat and which the chaff. This triall is to prove you and all of us, and ſee whether we are light or ſolid, approved and ſound in the faith, or hypocrites; If this triall turn you quite over to the diviſion of Separation and Anabaptiſm, and to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of the Quakers, we ſhall know that you were before a proud, giddy, unſetled Novice, not approved of God nor ſound at the heart. And it's an exellent work of God, thus to prepare for the great Iudgement, and make ſuch an open diſcovery of ſuperficial, proud, unſanctified men; For as it's ſaid <hi>1 Joh. 2. 19. [They went out from us but they were not of us; for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us, but they went out that they might be made manifeſt that they were not all of us.]</hi> The Lord open your eyes, and humble your heart, and acquaint you with your great darkneſſe and imperfections, and with the ſufficiency of holy Scriptures, and the neceſſity of his Order and Miniſtry, and the need that you have of thoſe Guides whom you deſpiſe, and the obedience and ſubmiſſion that you owe them, and the excellency of the Churches Unity, and the miſchief of all diviſions and hereſies, and recover you from their ſnares.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore the laſt I wrote to you, I had received three ſeverall Papers, with the Names of three ſeverall Perſons of you inſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> One <hi>Iane Hicks,</hi> one <hi>Thomas Chaundler,</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Neway.</hi> Theſe I have yet to ſhew, though the ſpirit that poſſeſſeth you did ſince prevail with you to call me falſe Lyar and Serpent in <hi>Folio,</hi> but for tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you that I had received them from you: Forſooth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I named not the woman before, and becauſe <hi>Neway</hi> wrote not: But might not I receive them as from them, and having their Names and only theirs inſcribed for all that? Since that time I have received two more, One ſubſcribed by <hi>Richard Farnworth</hi> and <hi>Thomas Goodier,</hi> and another without any ſubſcribed Name. I ſhewed <hi>Tho. Goodier</hi> that with his Name, and asked him whether he owned it, who told me, he neither read it nor mine which it replied to, and yet ſo farre belived thoſe that bad, that he owned his Name at it. Having received in your firſt Letters, almoſt nothing but ſome Sheets of [Thou Serpent, Viper, thou Childe of the Devil, thou Son of perdition, thou dumb dog, thou falſe hireling, thou falſe Liar Deceiver, greedy dog, thou ravening Wolf, thou curſed hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,]
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45242:14"/>
with much more of the like; I returned you no Reply, as confeſſing my ſelf not ſo well skilled in that language and learning as you are; And for the dunghil-heaps of falſe accuſations annexed, I paſſe them by, as being well known to be impudent ſlanders; Such as my [upholding acourſed, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Government, falſe worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> for which you dare ſay [the vengance of the Lord is againſt me,] while you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only one word of a Paper of mine, wherein I moved that men be reſtrained [from preaching againſt the Eſſentials or Foundamentals of Chriſtianity,] which one of you tels me is a reſtraining men from [ſpeaking any more in Chriſts name] and a perſecuting Chriſts Miniſters:] we may ſee what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity and Chriſts Miniſters are in your account, who take it for ſuch damnable enmity to Chriſt, for a man to be reſtrained from Preaching that there is no Chriſt, or from reproaching him: I doe not think if I had deſired that men ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from calling you damnable Hereticks, or the Baſtards of the Papiſts, that you would have been ſo froward as to have ſaid that herein I was your Enemy; Nor do I think you would have taken it for any dangerous reſtraint to the Liberty of their Conſciences; But Chriſt will deal juſtly with you though you deal unjuſtly with him and his.</p>
            <p>When your Praters were here, I deſired to know the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground of all theſe heavy accuſations; that muſt prove me a childe of the devil, a greedy dumb dog, a Son of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with all the reſt. And I could have no proof of all but this; That I was called Maſter, That I ſtood in a high place to preach, and that I ſtudied, and that I preached by an hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe, and ſo would limit the Spirit if I had it; and that I took money, for Tythes: Falſe doctrine and worſhip I was charged with in general, but not one word of inſtance in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that I can remember: To theſe charges I ſhall give you ſome account anon.</p>
            <p>When I had received your 24 Queries, I ſent you my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that if you would but ſubſcribe your conſent that I ſhould come to your meeting, and anſwer them all by word of mouth without diſturbance, and you would receive what was made plain to your ſelves to be the Truth; I was willing to come
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45242:14"/>
over to that end: This motion you deteſt and reject with a Sheet of further Revilings in the ſame-language as the firſt were: I hope you will not take it ill if I reply not in that grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or barking Rhetorick; For if I be a dumb dog, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect that I ſhould equal you in ſnarling, or barking, or howling.</p>
            <p>But have you not bewraied your deceitfulneſſe in refuſing to conſent that I ſhould come and anſwer your Queſtions? Do not you ſhew by this, that you are children of the Darkeneſſe, and the Works of darkneſſe you are carrying on? When you hate the Light becauſe your Deeds are Evil? Why would you ſend me Queries which you would not give me leave to anſwer by Speech? What was it that you feared?</p>
            <p>But in ſtead of this, you [charge and command me in the Name of the moſt high God to anſwer them in writing] that you may [publiſh them with your Reply if need be.] But when I deſired to ſee the Commiſſion by which you claim this Authority, you ſhew me none, but tell me, It is inviſible. And may not all the world command me on theſe terms as well as you? In ſtead of admitting me to anſwer in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, ſome of you came over (taking a time when the Lord had ſhut me up by ſickneſſe, and could not go to the publique meeting) to make a diſturbance in our Aſſembly, <hi>Mar.</hi> 25. and to try your Rhetorick on the mindes of People in this place: whereupon it pleaſed the Magiſtrate to binde one of you to the good behaviour, for the publique Diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and railing at the Magiſtrate: And upon this you ſend another paper with an outcry againſt us as perſecutors: when you might know, that I was not concerned in the buſineſſe; and when indeed no man did ſo much as once ask my advice in it. But as for them that did it, I dare no more accuſe them of perſecution, then I dare accuſe them for perſecution who ſhall burn a Thief in the hand. Alas, what impatient ſoules are you, to cry out ſo much of perſecution, when many a poor-ſcold is duck in the Gumble-ſtool for words more incomparably ſweet and Lamb-like then yours?</p>
            <p>I ſhall now come to ſay ſomewhat to your Papers; and firſt give you a word of my reaſon, why I may not anſwer them
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45242:15"/>
ſo punctually in order, and word by word, as you command me to do: 1. Becauſe I dare not be guilty of loſing ſo much precious time: 2. Becauſe I have much more profitable work to do, though you accuſe me for Idleneſſe, becauſe I do not dig or threſh: when yet your Praters when they were here, did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dig nor threſh any more then I: nor do I hear that they do elſewhere, as they follow their ſeducing imployment. 3. Becauſe you have heapt up <hi>non-</hi>ſence, vain repetitions and confuſions, ſo as to anſwer you accordingly would be of ſmall uſe to any, and would but prove me to be like your ſelves. Many more Reaſons I overpaſſe. There is not a ſcold in all the Countrey, but may as honeſtly and reaſonably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me in the Name of God to come and ſcold with them in the Market-place, as you may Command me thus to anſwer your ſcurrilous ſcolding Papers. Yet you ſhall have no Cauſe to complain that I have overpaſſed any thing that's worthy to be regarded.</p>
            <p>YOur firſt Query is, <hi>[What's the firſt Principle of the pure Religion?]</hi> To which I anſwer, 1. [That God is] and next [that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him] <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. 2. Do you ask this as Learners? No that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce. Or as Teachers? Why then do you not ſhew your Commiſſion to teach? And why do you not plainly Teach, but ask Queſtions? Or do you ask it for matter to feed your prating and ſlandring?</p>
            <p>Your ſecond Query is <hi>[Whether they are a Church of Chriſt that beat and perſecute them that witneſſe forth the Truth in his Name?</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doubtleſſe it's poſſible for a true Church to be guilty of injuries. But you have as little cauſe to put this Queſtion, as the <hi>Turk</hi> hath. What would you anſwer if a <hi>Iew</hi> or a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a Witch, ſhould put this Queſtion? [Is it a true Church that perſecuteth them that witneſſe the truth] Surely it's nothing to you, who witneſſe abominable falſhoods and dreames. 2. But I'll tell you what do. When you come home, go to ſome of your Goſſips, the Friers or other Papiſts, and ask them this Queſtion: Whether it be a true Church
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45242:15"/>
which ſet up the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Irquiſition? and Cauſed the <hi>French</hi> Maſſacre? and hath by flames and ſword drawn out the bloud of ſo many hundred thouſand true Chriſtians? Ask them, Whether the Butcheries of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were done by a true Church? It may be they will give you a moſt ſatisfactory Anſwer then I can, becauſe you will ſooner hear them.</p>
            <p>Your third Queſtion is about <hi>Infant-Baptiſm.</hi> Of that I have already written a whole Book, which in modeſty you ſhould peruſe, before you call to me for more. Have you ſoberly read what I have there wrote already? If not, to what purpoſe ſhould I write more to you of the ſame ſubject.</p>
            <p>Only to your Query, I will adde this Query to your Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Anabaptiſts: Whether by this time they do not feel Gods plagues upon their party? And whether God do not viſibly teſtifie againſt them from Heaven, in giving up their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples to all kinde of abominations? And whether the Plague of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> be not on thoſe hearts, and of the blinded <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> on their eyes, that in all this can ſee no reaſon at leaſt to be very ſuſpicious of their way? and whether they are yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to wink on to deſtruction, or to ſtay till all turn Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Ranters or infidels? And how much <hi>England</hi> yet feels it ſelf beholden to Separation and Anabaptiſtry? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not the Seperated and Anapaptiſts Churches that are emptied by the Quakers?</p>
            <p>Your fourth, fifth, ſixth, ſeventh, eight and ninth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are all about Tythes: The ſubſtance of which I had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered long ago to ſome of your leading Bretheren, in a Book called, <hi>The Worceſterſhier Petition Defended;</hi> to which Book I referre you, to ſpare the labour of ſpeaking one thing twice; and modeſtly ſhould have taught you to take notice of that which I have done already, before you call for the ſame things again. Only let me now adde theſe Queries alſo to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. Whether have you read any of thoſe Books that are written long ago, to prove that Tythes are ſtill of Divine Right? If you have not, were it not well beſeeming a tender
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45242:16"/>
Conſcience to hear all that can be ſaid, before men adventure to rail againſt that which they do not underſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Whether there be not ſufficient Scripture to warrant a man to Dedicate part of his Lands to God, for the ſervice of his Church, and promoting of his Worſhip? Yea, Whether they did not in the Primitive times, ſo Dedicate all? ſelling it, and laying down the Price at the Apoſtles feet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu</hi> 3. Is it not lawfull to take and uſe that which is ſo Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated? And if the Apoſtles and firſt Church Officers might take all, May not we take the Tenths, when they are thus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. If our Anceſtours, many an Age ago have given the Tenths to the Church for the Miniſtry, are not thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Church-robbers that ſhould now take them away, having nothing to do with them? And do not you counſel men to the ſin of <hi>Iudas</hi> or of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sephira?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 5. If one that bears the bag prove a <hi>Iudas</hi> and Thief, or one <hi>Nicolas</hi> a Deacon ſhould lead a Sect of <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> your Predeceſſours, Whether are all the Apoſtles therefore Thieves, or all the Churches and Paſtors greedy dogs, for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king much more then the Tenths, even mens whole Eſtates that gave them to that uſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 6. Whether I, or other Miniſters do ask the people ſo much for preaching as the Quakers receive themſelves? Do not you receive meat and drink, to ſuſtain your lives? But we ask not meat and drink of any, nor any thing elſe, that is theirs: The Tythes is none of theirs, nor ever was, nor their fathers before them; but they bought or took Leaſes of their Lands, with the Condition of paying the Tenths as none of their own. We ask them not for a peny, but only to divide between theirs and ours, and give us our own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 7. If it be not a wrong to the people more then to the Miniſters to have the ſtanding Church-maintenance taken away, Why then do people petition ſo hard for Augmentations where Means is wanting? Or elſe do worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 8. If the Supream Rulers of the Commonwealth may lay an Exciſe or Tax on the Nation, and pay Souldiers with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45242:16"/>
one part of it, what forbids but that they may pay Miniſters of the Goſpel with the other part? And if they may lay a Tax for them, Why may they not fix a ſetled Maintenance in Tenths for them, much more, why may they not let them poſſeſſe that which is theirs already by their fore-fathers gift?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 9. Where doth any Scripture forbid paying or taking Tythes? I have ſhewed you in my other Book, where it commandeth allowing ſufficient Maintenance? Shew where it condemneth the Tenth part any more then the ninth, or the eleventh, or twelfth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 10. When God hath commanded a ſufficient maintenance in general, and left it to humane prudence to judge what is ſufficient (before they give it;) If then a man ſhall ſay [Where doth the Scripture require the Tenths? and you are no true Miniſters who take the Tenths;] Is not this as wiſe as to ſay, [Though Chriſt and his Apoſtles did wear clothes, yet ſhew where any of them preacht in doublet, or breeches, or ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or elſe you are falſe Prophets for wearing theſe;] Is not this as wiſe arguing as the other, and to the ſame purpoſe?</p>
            <p>And where you ask us ſo oft whether the Apoſtles took the Tenths, I tell you again, they took more, that is, men ſold all and laid down the money at their feet. It's true that then the poor alſo were maintained out of it; And if you will ſhew a Commiſſion to examine us, we will give you an account how far we maintain the poor out of our meer tenth part. In the mean time it's unreaſonable, that you demand, that we ſhould <hi>ſo maintain them as to ſuffer no beggars;</hi> For if all that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath will not maintain twenty poor people if he give it them all, how ſhould he then maintain a hundred with it?</p>
            <p>Your 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Qu.</hi> is, <hi>[Whether Chriſt enlighteneth every one that cometh into the world?]</hi> To which I anſwer, Yea, he doth ſo; All that come into the world of nature, he enlighteneth with the light of Nature (ſo called becauſe that it is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge gotten by the Book of the Creatures and natural means, without ſupernatural Revelation though it be of grace alſo as it is freely given after a forfeiture;) And all that come into the world of grace he enlighteneth with the light of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45242:17"/>
Having ſaid as much to this Query as you require, I will <hi>gratis</hi> adde ſomething that I may pleaſe you by ſupererroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I lately ſaw another Paper of your Queries which you have diſperſt in other places, which ſpeaks almoſt only of <hi>This Inward Light;</hi> In which I perceived 1. That you falſly intimate that we deny the neceſſity of an inward light, when as we maintain that the external light of the Word alone is not ſufficient without the inward light of the Spirit. 2. You there intimate to us a ſuppoſed ſufficiency of the inward light that every man in the world hath. Concerning which I ſhall ſay more anon, and now only demand of you. 1. Whether you mean it is ſufficient to leave men without excuſe, (That we maintain as well as you) or is every mans light ſufficient to his ſalvation? If ſo Q. 2. Was it ſufficient before Chriſt preached the Goſpel and ſent his Apoſtles? Or is it now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to all that never heard the Goſpel; If ſo, Is not the Goſpel a vain and needleſſe thing? or are you Chriſtians that dare ſo affirm? Q. 3. If the world have ſufficient light, what need they your teaching, or diſcourſe, or conviction? Q. 4. If all have ſufficient light within them, what need there any converting grace? Q. 5. Then why did Chriſt ſend <hi>Paul</hi> to open mens eyes, and to turn them from darkneſſe to light, if they had ſufficient light before, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. Q 6. I pray you do not diſdain to tell me when you have rub'd your eyes, if all men have ſufficient light within them, Why you got up into the Judgement ſeat, and pronounced me ſo oft to be in darkneſſe, and to be void of the light, and to have none of the Spirit. If all have it, why may not I have it?</p>
            <p>But let me tell you further in your ear, that we that you ſo frantickly bawl againſt, have read <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſo oft, that we cannot be ignorant who are your Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, though your ſelves are ignorant; We know how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly the Jeſuites would perſwade us that there is a light in every mans conſcience, which if he improve and husband well, God is bound to give ſuch additions as ſhall make it become ſaving, and that by the good uſe of natural light men may certainly get ſupernatural; and that it is in mens own power, what light ſoever they have to improve it to ſalvation.</p>

Your 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Query is, <hi>[Whether we have ſeen Gods face?] Anſ.</hi> Whether theſe be Learning, or Teaching, or quarrelling, or doting Queſtions, I leave to your conſideration: but what Call you had to propound them to ſuch Serpents, Dogs, and Children of the devil, as you call us, I know not: But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I'le anſwer you truly. 1. By the eye of reaſon I have ſeen that there is a God, and that he is infinite, incomprehenſible, moſt great and moſt good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. The ſame I have ſeen more cleerly by the eyes of faith. 3. But I never ſaw God by the eye of fleſh, for none can ſo ſee God and live, <hi>Nor hath any man ſeen God at any time, ſaving the only begotten Son who is in the boſome of his Father, he hath declared him.</hi> 4. Nor have I ſeen him in glory intuitively, or as the glorified in heaven do. If you ſay you have ſeen more, I ſhall not be very forward to beleeve you, till I ſee better fruits of it. I alſo therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you, Whether he that hath ſeen God do not abhor himſelf (as <hi>Iob</hi> did) in duſt and aſhes? and whether the true knowledge of God do not ever abaſe the ſoul, and make a man very mean in his own eyes? And then is it likely that ever thoſe men had the true knowledge of God, who make it their buſineſſe to exalt themſelves as having the Spirit, and beign perfect without ſin, and to revile and bedung other men with their reproaches, as being all the Children of the devil, and of darkneſſe, that be not of their ſtrain, and rave not as they do? The Phariſee that thanked God he was not as other men, nor as the Publicane, ſpoke humbly and modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in compariſon of you, and yet was he counted a proud ſelf-juſtifier: If ever you come to the leaſt ſaving ſight of God, it will mightily change the proud ſtrain of your ſpirits, and make you abhor the thoughts of your preſent evil waies.</p>

of them, would fain perſwade us that we ſubvert Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and are little better then Infidels, becauſe we are not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible: But I will anſwer you and your Maſters together in a word. 1. The Prophets and Apoſtles had infallible Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of new matters of divine verity, not before revealed, becauſe they were to be Gods penmen and Meſſengers of ſuch New Revelations, I have none ſuch that I know of. 2. The Prophets and Apoſtles were guided infallibly in the manner as well as the matter, ſo that every word that they wrote to the Churches was infallibly true; I have no ſuch Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, nor your Grandfather the Pope neither: He may erre while he pretendeth to the greateſt Infallibility in deciding Controverſies. 3. What man ſoever he be in the world that beleeves any Truth, he doth infallibly believe it; For he that is in the right is not deceived ſo far, and he that is not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is ſo farre infallible, which is no more then <hi>non fallitur.</hi> 4. But if by [Infallibility] you ſhould mean the clearneſſe and ſubjective <hi>Certainty,</hi> as diſtinct from the objective and the bare truth of our conceptions, then I ſay, that's another thing then Infallibility, and not to be ſo called, and of that <hi>Certainty</hi> men have different degrees: All true Chriſtians are certain of their Fundamentals, yet ſometime with ſome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that they may finde cauſe to ſay with the Apoſtles, <hi>Lord, Increaſe our Faith;</hi> or, <hi>We beleeve, help thou our unbelief;</hi> But in leſſer controverted Points which Salvation dependeth not on, the beſt man on earth may erre, much more be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; So that in a word, Every Church <hi>in ſenſu compoſite,</hi> while a Church is infallible in the eſſentials of Chriſtianity; and ſo is every true Chriſtian: And alſo they know infallibly every other truth that indeed they know; becauſe Truth is Truth whether they know it or not, and when they do know it they are not deceived; But in many things we all erre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know but in part, and ſo farre are deceived.</p>
            <p>Well, I ſay ſtill, Fair fall the honeſt humble Chriſtian that will confeſſe with <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>we know but in part;</hi> For I ſhall never like pretenders to un-erring Infallibility more; I know but two ſuch pretenders, and they are both the moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable deceivers and deceived, One is the Pope and his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and who more erroneous? The other is your ſelves, even
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45242:18"/>
diſtracted with errour. The Pope venteth abundance of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods in doctrine, and corruptions in diſcipline and worſhip, and with all theſe errors in his hands, proteſteth he is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Quakers (all that yet have wrote to me or ſpoke to me) pour out the greateſt abundance of moſt impudent Lies, and ſpue their filthy railings in the faces of almoſt all they come near, ſo that I know not whether ever the Sun ſaw a more hardened, ſhameleſſe, abominable Generation then they (with their brethren the Ranters) are; and yet with all this filth upon their lips, they confidently profeſſe that they are infallible and without ſin; You may well excuſe us that we be not haſty in beleeving you till we ſee more reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>Your 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Qu.</hi> is, <hi>[What is Hels month that the wicked go in at,</hi> &amp;c.] I anſwer. 1. You are liker to know ere long then I; If a miracle of grace ſave you not, you'le be better able to anſwer this Query then yet your unbelief will give you leave. 2. It ſufficeth me to know that Hell is a ſtate of endleſſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, where ſuch as you ſhall everlaſtingly bear the effects of Gods wrath and juſtice with the devils and his Angels that now ſeduce you, if timely recovery prevent it not.</p>
            <p>Your 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Qu.</hi> is, <hi>[Whether the Bible be the Word of God? and</hi> Matthew, Mark, Luke <hi>and</hi> John <hi>be the Goſpel, and whether there were any Goſpel before them, and whether they be the light?]</hi> To which I anſwer, 1. Only Jeſus Chriſt is the co-eſſentiall, co-eternal Word of the Father, being one with the Father. 2. But the holy Scriptures are the temporal expreſſed Word, that is, the ſigns of Gods minde to man, ſo that Chriſt and the Scriptures are nor called the Word in the ſame ſenſe, no more then is the Word of a mans minde, and the word of his mouth or pen. This ſignifying word was preached before it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and then was the Goſpel, but it was written after it was ſo preached at firſt, that it might be a ſtanding Rule, and might be kept intire and ſure to the Church to the worlds end; For the bare memories of men would not have kept them for us with ſuch certainty as they have been kept in Scripture and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto us, This Word therefore is the light, but not as Chriſt is the light, or as the Spirit is the light, for there are many lights that muſt concurre to give us light. It is a wiſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45242:19"/>
Queſtion of him that ſhall ask, Whether the light by which a man ſees be the viſive faculty of his eyes, or the light of a Candle, or the light in the air, or the Sun? Why it may be all theſe, There muſt be 1. A Sun. 2. A light from that Sun in the air. 3. An inward light in the eyes. 4. And that outward received by the inward, before you can ſee; So God in Chriſt is the Sun, Mans Reaſon is the Eye, The Goſpel or Word of God is the external Light flowing to us from the Sun, The Spirit cloſeth theſe two together, even the Goſpel and our Reaſon, and by its powerful work in that cloſure, breedeth a ſpecial illumination in the ſoul which the Word alone could not produce.</p>
            <p>I ſhall adde ſome Queries to you. 1. Do you beleeve the Scriptures to be true or not? If you do, then you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve what they ſay of themſelves; But they call themſelves the Word of God, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. &amp; 4. 2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 25. And often they are called <hi>the Laws of God, his Teſtimonies, his Statutes, his Precepts, his Promiſes, Goſpel, Covenants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All Scripture is written by divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>The word of Prophecy is a ſure Word,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Will you give us leave to ſmell the Pope in your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to diſgrace the Scriptures, though your own Noſes be ſtopt? For we have been uſed to deal with him at this wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and know that this is the main point of his New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</p>
            <p>Your 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Qu.</hi> is, <hi>[Whether we own Revelations or no?] Anſ.</hi> I own all divine Revelations, and diſown all diabolicall ones, ſo farre as I know them. I own all thoſe bleſſed Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions contained in the holy Scriptures; for they were infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly ſealed by multitudes of uncontrolled miracles and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of holineſſe; I believe that the Scriptures or Laws of Chriſt being finiſhed and ſealed, we muſt hold theſe till the coming of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13, 14. and that Chriſt will be with the Preachers of this ſame doctrine to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20, 21. and that theſe are able to make men wiſe to ſalvation without any more additions, and therefore no more is to be expected. But yet I beleeve 1. That God hath not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45242:19"/>
tied himſelf from revealing particular matters in ſubſervierty to Scripture extraordinarily, as divers murders have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and the like matters of fact. 2. And I beleeve that all true Chriſtians have the illuminating, ſanctifying Spirit of Chriſt to help them to know all the meaning of the Scripture which is of flat neceſſity to ſalvation, and more, according to their ſeveral meaſures of the Spirit with other helps.</p>

Q</hi> 5.

            <p>Your 19. <hi>Qu.</hi> is, <hi>[Whether they that ſtand praying in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues or Idols Temples, and love greetings in the markets, and bindes heavy burthens on the people, and are called of men Maſter, be not out of Chriſts Doctrine?] Anſ.</hi> Becauſe this is all that you go about to prove me a falſe Prophet by, I ſhall ſay the more to your ſatisfaction. 1. If our Temples be Chriſts Temples, do they not blaſphemouſly make Chriſt an Idoll, that call them Idols Temples. 2. If you are not wilfully blinde, you may perceive that it is not all the external actions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. that Chriſt condemneth, but the pride and hypocriſie which the Phariſees manifeſted in them.

that he bids men even hear the hypocriticall Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and obſerve and do what they bid men obſerve and do, becauſe they ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair. It is not therefore all the faults there charged on them that will acquit men from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their doctrine. Is this agreeable to your practiſe who damn men that deſpiſe not and reject not Chriſts moſt upright and faithful Miniſters? Their ſin is laid down in the 5<hi rend="sup">ht</hi> verſe] <hi>All their works they do to be ſeen of men.]</hi> Prove this of us if you can?

Greetings in the market-place when did I deſire? Or to be called <hi>Rabbi?</hi> But I pray you mark that it is not <hi>[uſing]</hi> but <hi>[loving</hi> the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt rooms that Chriſt condemneth, elſe no man muſt ſit uppermoſt, and then we muſt have none but round Tables or not fit at all: So conſequently it is not being called Rabbi or Maſter that Chriſt intendeth, but a proud deſire of and love to thoſe Titles: As a man may accept of the higheſt room for <hi>Order,</hi> that <hi>loveth</hi> it not in <hi>Pride;</hi> ſo may he accept of the Title of Maſter from thoſe that owe him reſpect, though he love it not in pride.</p>
            <p>Beſides I pray you note, that Chriſt forbiddeth the Name of Maſter no further then he forbiddeth the Name of <hi>[Father]</hi> verſ 9. <hi>[Call no man your Father upon earth;]</hi> And yet do you not know how oft the word <hi>[Father]</hi> is owned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and children <hi>commanded to love and obey their Fathers,</hi> and honour them: I know the higheſt of your Sect do forbid the owning of any ſuch Relations, or Names, as Fathers, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Husband, Wife, Maſter, Servant, Magiſtrate, Subject; and they forbid all affections to ſuch Relations, or honour or reſpect: But if you were not hypocrites, you would plainly ſpeak this out, and then people would better underſtand you when you tail as Miniſters for-being called Maſters.</p>
            <p>But for the ſake of thoſe among you that are not paſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45242:21"/>
I will tell you that which it ſeemeth you know not; The Phariſees had their ſeverall Schools, Sects, as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſohpers had, and every one gloried in his Diſciples, and thoſe Diſciples in their own Sect-maſters; One cried up ſuch a man, and another ſuch a man, inſomuch as ſometimes the followers of theſe ſeveral Sect-maſters would fall together by the ears and kill each other in the Temple, and in the ſtreets, while they contended for their Maſters honours; And look what faith the Maſter was of, the Scholars muſt all be of his faith; They muſt take their belief on truſt from him; Theſe leading men that were the Maſters of their Schools and ſects, whom none muſt contradict, were called by the Jews Rabbi's and Fathers, as the Papiſts now call their Biſhop <hi>The Pope,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>A Father,</hi> becauſe as children muſt be wholly ruled by the Fathers, ſo would the Phariſees have their Diſciples to be by them, be the matter right or wrong. Juſt thus do the Papiſts require, that the people beleeve as the Church beleeves, that is, the Pope and his Conſiſtory whatever it be, and tell us, that they are infallible, as being guided by the infallible Spirit, and therefore we muſt believe them by an implicit faith. Now the Lord Jeſus meeteth with theſe Phariſees, and commandeth his diſciples; That they call no man on earth Father, or Rabbi, or Maſter, as the Phariſees were called, that is, To have no ſuch abſolute Maſter of your Religion, or Lord of your faith, becauſe we have all one ſuch Abſolute Father which is God, and one ſuch abſolute Maſter which is Chriſt; This is the very ſame thing that <hi>Paul</hi> meant when he chides them for ſaying, <hi>I am of Paul, and I am of Apollo,</hi> as if Chriſt were divided, or <hi>Paul</hi> had been crucified for them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. And it's the ſame thing that <hi>Peter</hi> means, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. where he giveth Miniſters the honourable Title of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Overſeers,</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and bids them <hi>overſee and feed the flock of God;</hi> but yet forbids them doing it as <hi>Lords over Gods heritage,</hi> becauſe the heritage is Gods, and Chriſt is the chief Shepherd. <hi>Paul</hi> cals a Biſhop the <hi>Steward of God,</hi> Tit. 1. 7. <hi>One that muſt rule the Church</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 4, 5. and 5. 17. and ſaith, <hi>He that deſires the Office of a Biſhop deſires a good work,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 1.

               </gap> is tranſlated <hi>[Maſter]</hi> too, and ſometime [a Teacher.] I pray you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider here your moſt ignorant and ſottiſh dealing; The Goſpel was not written by the Apoſtles in Engliſh but in Greek: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one word ſignifieth a Teacher and a Maſter (ſuch as a Schoolmaſter is) and our Tranſlators ſometime tranſlate it a Teacher and ſometime a Maſter, you impudently cry out that one of them is not Scripture, and yet yield that the other is; When in the Greek they are the ſame word, as you may ſee it uſed in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 46. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 7. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 40. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 1.

And <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 25. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Feſtus, Moſt Noble Feſtus,</hi> and calleth <hi>Agrippa, King Agrippa, Act.</hi> 26. 2, 26, 27. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 10. We are commanded <hi>[In honour to prefer one another,]</hi> So that it's one mans duty to give thoſe Titles which another may not ambitiouſly ſeek. For my part I will gladly make this agreement with you, I will never wiſh any man to call me Maſter, nor be diſpleaſed with any that doth not (on that account) if this will ſatisfie you. But then I confeſſe I dare not condemn them that uſe ſo much ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility or reſpect, becauſe Gods Word is of more eſteem with me then your moſt confident fancies and reproaches.</p>
            <p>By this time me thinks I may well take leave to ſalute you with this Query, <hi>Whether that man be not void of the fear of God, and given over to a ſeared Conſcience, that dare go up and down to rail againſt the moſt faithfull and painfull Miniſters of Chriſt, whom they are not able to charge with any crime but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailties, and that becauſe they are called Maſters? and all this upon meer ſottiſh ignorance of the Scripture that ſo commonly uſeth and alloweth the Title.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that I could get to all this from your Prater <hi>Tho. Goodier</hi> that was here, was but this, <hi>[I deny thy Greek and Hebrew if the Scripture be truly tranſlated;]</hi> which is but to ſay, I deny the words of Chriſt and the Apoſtles: For <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e tranſlating, there are many words in the Original Language which have not ſo many and apt in Engliſh to expreſſe them by? Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting excludeth not the neceſſity of explicating; And who knows not that one Engliſh word hath many ſignifications? There is a Beaſt called a Wolf, and a Fiſh called a Wolf, and an eating diſeaſe called a Wolf; Are theſe therefore all one, becauſe they have one Name; So a Sect-maſter is called a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, One that would be the Lord of mens faith is called a Maſter, and a Teacher of the Church of Chriſt is called a Maſter: Doth it follow that all theſe are forbidden becauſe one is?</p>
            <p>Your Prater alſo made a ſtirre with me for calling the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Languages <hi>the Originall,</hi> becauſe forſooth the Spirit of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45242:23"/>
God is the Original. And is not that a wiſe man to go cry down the Miniſtry, that cannot diſcern the difference between <hi>the Original cauſe</hi> and <hi>the Original Language.</hi>

            <p>He charged me alſo to be empty of the Spirit becauſe I ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, and told me, he did not ſtudy, no not in ſpeaking what to ſay, I the leſſe marvell at his non-ſence: But I pray God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me that I Study no more; Do you think we cannot talk without ſtudy as well as you, and I hope a little better; and when the lazy fit overtaketh Miniſters, they are ready to preach without ſtudy as well as you do: I can bring you a woman fit for the gumbleſtool, that ſhall without any ſtudy talk it out with the beſt of you: We do not ſo deſpiſe God, his Word or our hearers, as to ſpeak before we conſider what to ſay.

And whereas you call us to threſh and dig, I profeſſe if God would give me leave, I ſhould take it for a great recreation and refreſhment to my body; and ſhould think it incomparably a more eaſie life then that which I endure; <hi>Solomon</hi> knew, and I know to my ſorrow, that much ſtudy is a wearineſſe to the fleſh; and might I but plough and dig I ſhould yet hope to live in ſome competent health, who now ſpend my daies in continuall pain and languiſhing. But then how ſhall I fulfill Gods command, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>[Meditate on theſe things; Give thy ſelf wholly to them</hi> (mark <hi>wholly) that thy profiting may appear to all.]</hi> How ſhould I <hi>[watch over the Church day and night]</hi> Act. 20. 31. yet whereas your Prater fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not before God to affirm, that if I had no pay I would not preach: I do here profeſſe before the ſame God that he is a Liar, and I prove it, becauſe I have long preached already with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pay, and been glad of Liberty, and I would labour with my hands, as far as my languiſhing body would bear, to ſupply my neceſſities, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to ſtop the mouths of your Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors rather then I would give over preaching the Goſpel. Judge therefore whether your Lying Spirit be the Spirit of God or the meet authour of Reformation, or whether indeed you are perfect without ſin?</p>
            <p>Your 20. <hi>Qu.</hi> is, <hi>[Did ever the Lord of Heaven and Earth,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I offered your Prater here to ſhew him my Comiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, if he would ſhew me his, and he told me that it was inviſible; and why may not you take the anſwer that you give? 2. The Lord called his firſt Apoſtles by his own voice, and appointed them to call others, and to eſtabliſh an Order for the ſucceeding of others in that Office of the Miniſtry to the end of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 21. and till the Saints be one perfect man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 14. that they that ſhould ever after be called, might not expect a voice from Heaven to their ears, but might be called in Chriſts appointed way? And in this way I have been called by Chriſt. The Signs of his Call are, 1. My comperent qualifications. 2. My thirſt after the good of ſouls and the building of that houſe of God. 3. The Ordination of authorized Church-Officers. 4. The Call and conſent of the people of Chriſt, over whom he hath ſet me. 5. And afterwards the ſucceſſe of my labours. 6. And ſome daily aſſiſtance of the Spirit in thoſe labours. 7. And ſome Teſtimony of the Spirit to my conſcience of Gods Acceptance. Theſe ſeven ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are my evidence of miſſion, ſhew you the like if you can.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither <hi>Paul</hi> not any true Miniſter is called by the meer will of man, nor are we the Servants of men; Nor were the Apoſtles called by men at all, but immediatly by Chriſt. But all afterwards were to be called by Chriſt, through the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>For this end left I thee in Crete, that thou ſhouldeſt ordain Elders in every City:]</hi> Act 14. 23. <hi>[When they had ordained them Elders in every Church,</hi> &amp;c.] The gift was given <hi>Timothy</hi> by prophecy <hi>with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,]</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 14. <hi>Paul</hi> directeth him whom to make Biſhops, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.

            <p>Your 21. <hi>Qu.</hi> is, <hi>[Whether had any Miniſters of Chriſtan hour-glaſſe to preach by, or took a Text, and raiſed Doctrines, Reaſons, Uſes, Motives, or a carnall Bell to call people together by, prove theſe things by Scripture, or elſe be ſilent, and never profeſſe your ſelves to be Ministers of Christ more]</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> By your patience, I muſt tell you, that the Concluſion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45242:24"/>
is but your Lordly ignorant command (ſuch as is joyned to many of the other Queries;) Scripture is Gods Laws, and fa ſufficient Rule for Doctrines, and worſhip it ſelf: But was never intended to name to you every circumſtance that is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ull about that worſhip. Hath Scripture told you at what place you ſhall meet, or at what hour? I tell you again, you ſpeak with no more wiſedom then if you ſhould ſay thus [Prove that ever man read the Bible with a pair of Spectacles, or that ever Chriſt or his Apoſtles uſed a printed Bible (when printing was invented but a while ago) or that ever they uſed an Engliſh Bible (when they wrote in Greek) or that ever they preached in doublet, breeches, or ſtockings, or elſe call your ſelves Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt no more?] And why ſo? Becauſe you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us, and yet tell us your Commiſſion is inviſible. Theſe Circumſtances are purpoſely left by Chriſt to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane prudence, as occaſions ſhall require; and therefore he bids us do all things to edification, and decently, and in order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. 4. And therefore ſure we muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what is edifying, decent and orderly; This is plain to them that will ſee: What, came the Word of God out from you, or came it unto you only? If any man think himſelf to be a Prophet or ſpiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write are the Commandments of the Lord; But if any be ignorant let him be ignorant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 36, 37, 38.</p>
            <p>But I pray you if an hourglaſſe be unlawful, tell us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Clock be lawful, or a Diall, or a Watch? or whether it be lawful to obſerve by the Sun how the time paſſeth? and why one is more unlawful then another?</p>
            <p>But your Prater told me, it was a limiting of the Spirit of God; As if I cannot limit my ſelf and not limit the Spirit? Or as if the Spirit excluded Reaſon and Prudence, and ſet a mans tongue a going, ſo that he cannot ſtop it. Did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſtint the Spirit becauſe they appointed their meetings on the Lords Day, and did not ſtay two or three daies together? why then may not we reſolve upon an hour as well as they did on a day, For one is limiting as well as the other. I think if I had your Spirit to liquor my tongue, I ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at the hourglaſſe, and preach the people of out the place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45242:24"/>
And for a Text: 1. Know you not that Chriſt himſelf took a Text, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. and applied it? Know you not that it was then the common practice of the Church to reade, expound, and apply the Scriptures, as <hi>Ezra</hi> did? Know you not that there is Doctrine, Reaſon, and Uſe in all the Sermons and Epiſtles of the Apoſtles? Know you not that we are commanded rightly to divide the Word of Truth, as workmen that need not be aſhamed, and to ſtudy thereto, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. Ah wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſouls that dare ſo blindely cavill with the work of God.</p>
            <p>For what you ſay of <hi>[a carnall Bell]</hi> it is like the reſt which I before anſwered, not fit for the mouth of a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to have mentioned. But I muſt tell you that our Bels are not carnall, if they were, they would ſcarce ſound ſo well or laſt ſo long. If your meaning be, that you would have us ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize our Bels to make them ſpirituall as your ghoſtly Fathers of <hi>Rome</hi> do, we will keep our carnall Bels till we know more reaſon for that practice.</p>
            <p>The 23. <hi>Qu.</hi> is this, <hi>[Whether are not they that bear rule by their means, and ſeeks for their gain from their quarter, and ſeeks for the ſleece, and makes a prey upon the people, and are hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, be not falſe Prophets, yea or nay, and whether ſuch be not to be cried out againſt now as they were then?]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I have ſufficiently anſwered already to your Brethren in my other book. Only let me tell you, 1. It is a moſt certain thing that God allowed the Prieſts the Tythes, and much more, when he thus cried out againſt them, Dare you deny that? If you dare not, confeſſe then that it was not the meer taking of Tyches that cauſed God ſo to rebuke them. Reade but <hi>Mal.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> &amp; the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> without Spectacles and then judge. It's moſt evident then that the thing that God condemneth was not taking Tythes, but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous greedy deſires after gain, and neglecting the good of ſouls and the work of God: And are not we as willing to caſt ſuch out as you are to reproach them? Whether we ſeek theirs or them, and whether we are not willing to ſpend and be ſpent for the ſalvation of our people, we muſt be tried by a more righteous Judge then you.</p>
            <p>Your 23. <hi>Qu.</hi> is, <hi>[Whether do you own trembling and quaking</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:45242:25"/>
               <hi>which the Scripture witneſſeth?] Anſ.</hi> I own the fear of the Lord which is the beginning of wiſedom, and think him bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that feareth alwaies, and that he that hardeneth his heart ſhall fall into miſchief; But I think that the great Quaking that was in the Army of the Philiſtines was no vertue or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to them, nor any ſign of God among them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 15. And I think that <hi>Perfect love coſteth out fear,</hi> and that thoſe ſhakings and quakings that come not from the humble ſence of ſin or Judgement, or the like, but in violent motions of the body affectedly, are either Papiſticall tricks of deceit, or effects of Phantaſtical conceit, or the motions of the great deceiver within you. I read of it as one of Gods curſes, that <hi>[The Lord ſhould give them a trembling heart,]</hi> Deut. 28. 65. And I am of opinion that the curſe is fallen upon you which is written, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 69. 23. <hi>[Let their eyes be darkened that they ſee not, and make their loins continually to ſhake.]</hi> Gods Kingdom is Righteouſneſſe, Peace, and Joy in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Your 24. and laſt <hi>Qu.</hi> is, <hi>[Whether do you ſay you ſhall be free from the body of ſin while you are on the earth, and whether ſhall any be perfect yea or nay?]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I beleeve that all true Converts are free from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſinne, but not from the remnants of it; And that our grace is of a perfect kinde, as a ſmall Candle is of a perfect kinde of fire, which yet will not enlighten all the Town or Houſe, nor ſcatter away all the darkneſſe as the Sun will do; I beleeve alſo that in the inſtant of death when we part with the fleſh, we part with all the remnants of ſinne. And for the Doctrine of perſonal ſinleſſe perfection here, I beleeve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the greateſt ſinner bred it; the Phariſee received the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtes and preparatives to it, the Hereticks and Papiſts firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and cheriſhed it, Chriſt deteſteth it, and never man that knew himſelf, or had one ſpark of true grace and Chriſtian experience, did to this day heartily believe it of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And I think that it is a part of the Papiſts dung which they have taught you to feed upon. Chriſts Kingdom is an Hoſpitall, he hath no Subjects in it but diſeaſed ones. The Fathers Kingdom before had perfect Subjects, and ſo ſhall it have again when Chriſt hath perfected us: For when he hath
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45242:25"/>
perfected us by healing all our diſeaſes and ſubduing all our enemies, even the laſt Enemy Death (at the Reſurrection) then will he give up the Kingdom to the Father. But now, <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> Jam. 3. 2. and there is no man on earth that doth good and ſinneth not; And if we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves and the truth is not in us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the truth is not in you Quakers.</p>
            <p>I conclude my Anſwer with this Queſtion to you; If you think you are perfect without ſin, whether do you alſo think that you are already in Heaven or perfect glory? For what can keep the ſoul from the perfect enjoyment of God, but ſinne. And to enjoy God perfectly is to be glorified perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But I forgot that your Brethren think Heaven and hell is only within men. Perhaps you look for no more Heaven then you have: And I wonder not at it: For if you did, in the way you are in, you are no more likely ever to finde it then Darkneſſe is to have communion with light, or <hi>Belial</hi> with Chriſt. The Lord give Repentance unto life, to thoſe of you that have not ſinned unto death, and ſhew you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heaven before you are out of reach of it, and a further Hell before you are in it. Though I look for no thanks from you for my charitable deſires, yet you ſhall have them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will or not.</p>
            <p>HAving been at this labour at your command to anſwer your Queries, may I not in reaſon expect that you ſhould anſwer ſome of mine, which I do but requeſt and not command: But I deſire of you that you will not put me by with Gumbleſtool Rhetorick in ſtead of Anſwers, but ſpeak conſiderately, truly, and to the Point in queſtion. I mean firſt that you will anſwer all thoſe Queries which I have before put to you among my Anſwers to yours, and then that you will anſwer alſo theſe twenty Queries following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. Are they not the very ſame Miniſters which you rail at, and which all the Drunkards, Swearers, Whoremongers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45242:26"/>
and ſenſuall wretches in the Countrey do hate and rail at as well as you? Are you not then on their ſide and poſſeſt with the ſame Spirit? They deſpiſe the Preachers of the Goſpel, and would have them down, and ſo would you, even the very fame men as they would; When they had opportunity they raged againſt them with Swords, and ſo do you with filthy tongues: Would not all the covetous, malignant, ungodly Enemies of Piety, have Tythes down as well as you? What think you? I can witneſſe it of moſt of my acquaintance that are ſuch? Moreover, were they not the ſame ſort of Miniſters which the late Biſhops ſilenced, ſuſpended, and otherwiſe troubled, and which you revile at? Is it not then the ſame Spirit by which you and all theſe were or are acted? Conſider and judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Whether it be not the ſame Spirit which moveth in you and in the Papiſts? When the Papiſts ſay, that we are no true Miniſters of Chriſt but deceivers, and teach the Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own brain, and delude ſouls, and ſo ſay you; The Papiſts ſay, Our Congregations are no true Churches, who own us as their Paſtors, and ſo ſay the Quakers; The Papiſts know that the great thing that muſt be done before they can feduce the people among us, is firſt to make them deſpiſe and reject their Teachers, and therefore they bend all their wits and endeavours to vilifie them and draw the hearts of the people from them; And ſo do the Quakers. The Papiſts main errour lieth in the contempt of the Scriptures; They ſay, they will not take it for the Word of God but on the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, and that it is but part of his word; The Quakers ſay, It is not the Word of God. The Papiſts ſay, It is but a dead Letter, and ſo do the Quakers: The Papiſts ſay, It is not fit to be the Judge of Controverſies, and ſo ſay the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers: The Papiſts preferre the Vulgar Tranſlation before the ſame words in Hebrew and Greek which the Spirit did indite the Scriptures in and ſo do the Quakers in Engliſh. Could the Papiſts but get down the Regulating Authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they would think they had won the Field; For they will not endure that all Spirits ſhould be tried by the written word, no more will the Quakers. The Papiſts maintain mans
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45242:26"/>
Free-will hath power before converſion to repent and believe, and turn to God, and that it is not only the fruit of the Spirit in the Elect, and ſo do the Quakers. The Papiſts tell men of the ſufficiency of the common-light that is within them, and ſo do the Quakers. The Papiſts ſay that a man may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without ſin in this life, and may fulfill all Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo do the Quakers. The Papiſts make this their perfection to lie in caſting off worldly callings, Emploiments, Relations after the fleſh, and propriety, as their Nuns, Monks, and Hermites do; yea, and in caſting off their old names, as their Pope doth when he is made Pope: And ſo do many of the Quakers, and much worſe, as I have ſeen in Papers under their own hands. The Papiſts place their Righteouſneſſe in their own works and perfection, while they ſlieght the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and ſo do the Quakers. The Papiſts place this Righteouſneſſe of their own Phariſaically in externals, and things that have a ſhew of wiſedom, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and neglecting of the body, not in any honour to the ſatisfying of the fleſh, as <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not,</hi> which all are to periſh with the uſing, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18, 20, 23. ſo do the Quakers in ſtead of preaching the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, call out for a formal Righteouſneſſe and perfection of our own, conſiſting in ſuch things as theſe following, to wit that we wear no Points, nor Cuffs, nor Lace nor any ſuch like, that we preach on the lower places and not (as <hi>Ezra</hi> did) in a Pulpit; that we uſe not an hourglaſſe to diſcern how the time paſſeth (whether a Clock or Watch be as dangerous I know not:) That we ſay <hi>[Thou]</hi> and not <hi>[You]</hi> to him we ſpeak to (when the word that Chriſt uſed ſignifieth <hi>You</hi> as well as <hi>Thou:</hi> That we call not men <hi>Maſters</hi> or women <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes,</hi> when the Scripture frequently uſeth and alloweth it, and much more: (though Chriſt forbid us to have any Sect-Maſters or Maſters of our Faiths;) In ſuch like as theſe doth the Quakers Righteouſneſſe lie, while they are ignorant of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe; And juſt is it with God that they who ſet up their own righteouſneſſe againſt Chriſts ſhould be given up to that helliſh deluſion, as to take the moſt Satani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſlanders, lies, hereſies, and railings, to be their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45242:27"/>
Were it not tedious and not much neceſſary, I could ſhew in many more particulars how the Papiſts and Quakets do ſo conſpire that we may well know whence their doctrines and deluſions came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. Whether there were ever greater Monſters of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude upon the face of the earth then theſe are, who ſet their hearts and tongues againſt thoſe Miniſters of Chriſt that lay out themſelves for the ſaving of ſouls, through all the ſcorns and oppoſition of all ſorts of wicked men, with whom theſe wretches joyn againſt them? Yea, and make their very ſtudy and labour their crime, when it were much eaſier for us to preach without ſtudy, and that I hope with ſomewhat more truth, ſenſe, and order then they that ſo boaſt of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Were not thoſe faithful Servants of God that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Martyrdom under Heathen and <hi>Arian</hi> Perſecutors, juſt ſuch Miniſters as theſe men do now vilifie; or wherein was the difference? And do not theſe wretches juſtifie their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 5. Are not the Miniſters whom theſe men deſpiſe, of the ſame calling and practice as thoſe were that ſuffered death in the Flames in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> daies? Such as <hi>Bradford, Hooper, Latimer, Ridly, Cranmer, Saunders, Philpot,</hi> and the reſt; Were not theſe called Maſters? Did they not preach in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and take Tythes or money for preaching as their due maintenance, and the other things that the Quakers accuſe us for? And do not theſe men juſtifie the bloudy oppoſers of them, and condemn Gods Saints afreſh?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 6. Whether ever the earth bore men that did more proudly deſpiſe others in compariſon of themſelves? and whether their language ſavour of the Spirit of the Lamb of God? Or can he have any taſte of that Spirit of Chriſt in himſelf that doth not even feel that their proud and railing language is of the devil?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 7. Was there ever a generation known on the earth, that did more arrogantly ſtep up into the Throne of God, and cenſure his Servants, whoſe faces they never ſaw, and whom they can charge with nothing but being Preachers of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45242:27"/>
the Goſpel, and that in a Pulpit, having an hourglaſſe, taking Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be Miniſters of the devil, ſons of perdition, with much of the like. Though Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Iudge not that ye be not judged, and who art thou that judgeſt another mans Servant?</hi> To his own Maſter he ſtands or fals.</p>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> 8. Was there ever a Generation of men on whom the Image of the devil was more viſible then on theſe? He is the Prince of darkneſſe, pride and malice; And the depth of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and height of pride and malice breaks out ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in their carriage and diſcourſe, that all not utterly blinded may ſee it. It is the work of the devil to be the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer of the Brethren;</hi> and ſo it is the very Religion and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of theſe wretches to accuſe Miniſters and godly people to be hypocrites, Liars, children of the devil, Serpents, Vipers, with much the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 9 Is it no kin to the blaſpheming of the holy Ghoſt for ſuch wretches, when they have powred out the moſt horrid lies, ſlanders, Railings, and falſe doctrines, to profeſſe ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that all this is from the Spirit of Chriſt within them, and make God and his holy Spirit the Author and Patron of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 10. Can that man that hath one ſpark of grace believe that he hath no ſin? Can he have ſo little knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? And conſequently of the need he hath of the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? Dare you ſay to Chriſt, we will not be beholden to thee for thy bloud to waſh us any more, or to thy Interceſſion to pard on us any more? Do you not believe that <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> Jam. 3. 2. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſinne we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us? If we confeſſe our ſinnes, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes, and to clenſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe: If we ſay that we have not ſinned, we make hem a lyar, and his Word is not in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 8, 9. 10. Are not all Chriſts Diſciples taught daily to pray <hi>[Forgive us our treſpaſſes.]</hi> For my part, I am one that is ſick and have need of the Phyſician, and dare not tell God that I will ask him pardon for no more ſins, nor be beholden to him for any more. But O what a power hath the deceiver with theſe wretches, that in the midſt of their horrid railing, flandring,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45242:28"/>
and other wickedneſſe, will ſtand to it that they have no ſin; Juſt like the Swearer that will ſwear he never ſwore an Oath; Or the Drunkard that will ſwear he was never drunk, when he lieth drunk in the Channell. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, There is not a juſt man upon earth that doth good and ſinneth not, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 20. and theſe Quakers that Phariſaically and Papiſtically juſtifie themſelves do give him the Lie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 11. Whether thoſe that deny Scripture to be Gods Word as theſe Quakers do, and deny that there is any ſuch Perſon as Jeſus Chriſt who ſuffered at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in heaven in the humane nature, and only call ſomewhat within themſelves by the Name of Chriſt, I ſay, whether theſe are not abominable Infidels, having nothing to do with the name of Chriſtians?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 12. Is it not damnable Hypocriſie in theſe wretches, to prate ſo much of Scripture, and call for Scripture, while they thus deny it to be Gods Word?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 13. Is it not damnable hypocriſie in them to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, when they are Infidels, and deny the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt crucified to be in heaven?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 14. Is not he a Pagan and no Chriſtian that thinks that the light which is in all the Indians, Americans, and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans on earth, is ſufficient without Scripture?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 15. Was that light in <hi>Paul</hi> which perſwaded him that he ought to do many things againſt the name of Jeſus, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convert him to the Faith of Jeſus? Or did Chriſt give him needleſly a light from heaven, and by <hi>Ananias</hi> his doctrine? O<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Or had all the world ſufficient light within them before Chriſt ſent abroad his Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel to them? Or did Chriſt ſend them a needleſſe light by his Apoſtles? Have thoſe Perſecutors ſufficient light within them to cauſe them to believe in Chriſt, who think they do God ſervice in killing or reproaching his Miniſters and people?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 16. If all have ſufficient light within them, what need you go up and down to teach or perſwade them? Is it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs light that you bring then, or is i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Qu.</hi> 17. Is it not a moſt ſottiſh trick of you to go up and down prating and commanding, and yet refuſe to ſhew your Commiſſion from God? And to call Miniſters to ſhew theirs, and refuſe to ſhew your own, but ſay it is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble within you: are you ſo mad as to expect any ſhould belive an inviſible and indemonſtrable Commſſion. And might not we as well tell you ours is inviſible (but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeed it is not;) Or ſhould we beleeve every one that prates of a Commiſſion within him or no; If not, why ſhould we belive you more then others that ſay the like?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 18. Seeing you cry down our Miniſtry and Churches, tell us which is the true Miniſtry and Church, and when yours begun, and where it hath been ſince Chriſts abode on earth till now? Speak plainly and let us know whether you are indeed Papiſts or Pagans?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 19. Is not that man an Infidell and a Scorner of Chriſt, that date ſay, he came into the world and ſhed his bloud, to gather onely a few raging Quakers in <hi>England</hi> 1652 years after his Incarnation? If Chriſt have no Subjects but theſe he is a poor King; If Chriſt have been till now without Subjects, he was no King; If without a Body, he was no Head; If without a ſpouſe, he was no Husband; Therefore ſhew us what Church Chriſt hath had, or confeſſe your ſelves Infidels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 20. Did not the Spirit of the Quakers ſpeak in <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 3. juſt as you do now againſt Magiſtrates and Miniſters? And is not God very patient that cauſeth not the earth to open and ſwallow you up quick as it did them? Do you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the <hi>Simonians</hi> (or Diſciples of <hi>Simon Magus)</hi> and the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> whoſe doctrine and deeds Chriſt hateth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and other Gnoſtick Hereticks in the Apoſtles daies, did deal by them, and the Church then as you do by us now? and that the ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the Epiſtle of <hi>Iude,</hi> much of 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> and 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> were written purpoſly againſt them; beſides many other Scriptures? And have you well conſidered thoſe Scriptures, and applied them to your ſelves.</p>
