         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the Saying of St. <hi>Gregory</hi>
ſurnamed the Great, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture was nothing elſe but
an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> ſent from Almighty
God to his Creature man, by which he might
be rightly informed in all thoſe points which
were fit or neceſſary to be known and train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in the practiſe of all thoſe duties which
were fit and neceſſary to be done: <hi>Quid enim
eſt Scriptura ſacra, niſi epiſtola Omnipotentis Dei
ad creaturam ſuam,</hi> as that Father hath it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which great example (though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
not in reference and relation to it) it
hath been the cuſtom of men in all times and
nations not extremely barbarous, when they
<pb facs="tcp:168623:3"/>
could not perſonally expreſſe their minds to
one another, to mannage intelligence in
the way of Letters of Epiſtles; in which they
comprehend all ſuch particulars as were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to be known to either party. <hi>Inventae
erant epiſtolae</hi> (as <hi>Tully</hi> tels us) <hi>ut certiores faceremus
abſentes, ſi quid eſſet quod eos ſcire, aut noſtrum, aut
ipſorum intereſſet.</hi> And to ſay truth they are our
ordinary Meſſengers of love and friendſhip,

               </gap>.
By them we commonly receive advice &amp;
counſel in our affairs of greateſt moment, and
to them we commit the cloſe conveyance of
ſuch ſecrets, as cannot with like confidence
be truſted to friends or ſervants, <hi>His arcana
notis terra pelagoque feruntur,</hi> as <hi>Ovid</hi>'s paſſionate
Lady writeth to her dear <hi>Hippolitus.</hi> In which
reſpect, conſidering that God hath placed us
at a diſtance, ſo that I cannot perſonally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with ſome particulars touching
the publiſhing of theſe Sermons, which I
think fit for you to know, that you may
make them known to others, I am compelled
(in a manner) to expreſſe them in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Epiſtle. In which I ſhall firſt preſent you
with thoſe <hi>impulſives</hi> which have induced me
(contrary to my former cuſtom and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:168623:3"/>
to commit theſe Sermons to the Preſs, and
then to let you know the reaſon why I have
made choice of your name in this Dedication.</p>
            <p>And firſt I muſt needs ſay (and I may ſay
it very truly) that I never did any thing in this
kind, of which I found my ſelf more obliged
to render a juſt account, then of the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the enſuing Sermons; which ſeems like
the adding of freſh leavs to a well grown tree
in the midſt of Sommer, of ſtars to a cleer fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
in a Winter night, or finally, of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to a full and unfathomed Ocean: and you
may juſtly ſay to me in the Poets words,
<q>
                  <l>Quid folia Arboribus, quid pleno ſidera Coelo,</l>
                  <l>In Freta collectas alta quid addis aquas?</l>
               </q>
That is to ſay,
<q>
                  <l>Why doſt thou adde freſh leaves unto the Trees,</l>
                  <l>Stars to the Heavens, or Water to the Seas?</l>
               </q>
In anſwer to which objection, I can neither
plead the importunity of friends, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of ſuperiors, nor the preventing of falſe
Copies from being brought unto the Preſs,
which I obſerve to be the common <hi>pretences</hi>
for printing Sermon upon Sermon; moſt of
the which, without any ſenſible loſſe to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or diſadvantage to the Church, might
have been buried in the Studies of them that
<pb facs="tcp:168623:4"/>
made them. And yet I would not have it
thought but that I have ſome reaſon for what
I do, more then the vulgar deſire of being in
print, there having been ſo much of mine on
the Preſs already, as might have ſatisfied the
folly of that deſire, were I guilty of it: and
therefore I ſhall let you know (and in you all
others who ſhall read them) thas theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
are now publiſhed on the ſame occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on which they were firſt penned and
preached, which was briefly this.</p>
            <p>It was about the Year 1636. in which the
Preſs began to ſwarm with libellous and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Pamphlets, deſtructive of the publick
peace, and tending to a manifeſt deſertion
of the received Government and Formes of
Worſhip by Law eſtabliſhed in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
In moſt of which the Biſhops gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
were accuſed for having a deſign to
bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> the regular <hi>Clergie</hi> of this
Church (my ſelf more frequently then any of
my ranck and quality) traduced and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for ſubſervient <hi>inſtruments:</hi> I had before,
and ſometimes after, been caſt upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of ſome of the <hi>puritan</hi> Controverſies,
(as they then called them) particularly in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Hiſtory of the Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>Anſwer to the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:168623:4"/>
               <hi>ſeditious Sermon and Apologie of Mr.</hi> H. B. <hi>of Friday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi>
the book entituled <hi>A Coal from the Altar,</hi> &amp;
the defence thereof called <hi>Antidotum Lincolnienſe,</hi>
touching the ancient &amp; moſt convenient ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the <hi>holy Table,</hi> which ſo exaſperated the
ſpirits of thoſe bitter men, who then diſturbed
both <hi>Ch.</hi> and <hi>State</hi> with their venemous libels,
that hardly any of that numerous litter had
crept into the world in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I was not openly
accuſed of <hi>Popery,</hi> or at the leaſt of being an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-factor</hi>
unto thoſe who had the chief mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of that deſign. For the decrying of which
ſcandal ſo unjuſtly raiſed (for <hi>actu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt de homine,
ubi actum eſt de nomine,</hi> as the old rule was) I fell
upon a reſolution of preaching theſe enſuing
Sermons before the King, (whoſe <hi>Chaplain for
Ordinary</hi> I then was, and had been many years
before) upon the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Tares;</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in them ſuch an aſſurance of my <hi>Orthodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xie</hi>
in Religion and averſeneſs from <hi>Popery,</hi> as
might declare me for a true ſon of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi> And this I did at ſuch a time
when the <hi>inclinations</hi> unto <hi>Popery</hi> were thought
(but falſly thought) to be moſt predominant
both in Court and Clergy: a courſe which
gave ſuch ſatisfaction unto a great part of the
auditors, who before did ſeem to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:168623:5"/>
perſwaded of me, that ſome of the more
moderate ſort did not ſtick to ſay (not to
touch here on ſome comparative expreſſions
which were uſed by others) that in the third
and fourth of theſe Sermons <hi>I had pulled up Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
by the very roots, and ſubverted the foundations
of it.</hi> Not much unlike to which was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of a great Peer of the Realm, who
being preſent at the ſixth Sermon, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſay, that it was generally affirmed in the
Country, that no Sermons were preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King, but ſuch as might be preached
in the <hi>Popes Chapel,</hi> but that if the Doctor had
preached the ſaid <hi>Sermon</hi> before the Pope,
what breakfaſt ſoever he had made for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he would have found but a ſorry dinner.</p>
            <p>This, as it was the occaſion which moved
me at that time to make choice of this <hi>parable</hi>
for the conſtant argument of my Sermons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King, ſo on the like occaſion I am
now induced (I may not unfitly ſay compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
to make them publick unto others. For,
notwithſtanding that I have ſo fully declared
my ſelf againſt the errors and corruptions of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in my late <hi>Comment</hi> on the
<hi>Creed,</hi> yet on a ſudden (whither I will or no)
I muſt be a Papiſt, a Jeſuit, or ſome Agent for
<pb facs="tcp:168623:5"/>
the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuſpected at the leaſt for ſuch by Dr.
<hi>Bernard,</hi> and (as he tells us) by others, for which conſult
the book entituled <hi>The Judgement of the late Lord</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<hi>&amp;c. pa.</hi> 115. The author of the Hiſtory of the
Life and Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> ecchoeth the words of
Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> which, like an <hi>Eccho,</hi> he reiterateth (<hi>voceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>què
refert, iteratque quod audit,</hi> as it is in <hi>ovid</hi>) in his ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
<hi>pamphlet</hi> called the <hi>Poſt-Haſt Reply,</hi> &amp;c. It was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for a prudent part in <hi>Sophocles</hi> (as indeed it was)
when he was once accuſed of madneſs, to produce one
of his <hi>Tragedies</hi> then newly written, to read the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the people of <hi>Athens,</hi> and then to ask his Judges,
<hi>Num illud carmen videretur eſſe hominis delirantis,</hi> whether
they thought it like to be the work of a man diſtracted?
And I hope it will be counted no imprudence in me,
being again accuſed of <hi>popery,</hi> or at the leaſt <hi>ſuſpected</hi> of
it to commit theſe Sermons to the Preſs, to offer them to
the reading of the people of <hi>Engl.</hi> &amp; then to put this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
to them, Whether they think ſuch Sermons could
proceed from the pen of a Papiſt, ſom Jeſuit, or Agent for
the See of <hi>Rom?</hi> Adde hereunto, that finding it wondred
at in print, <hi>that ſo many of my books do ſo little concern my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion</hi>
(though I know none that do ſo little concern the
ſame as the Pamphlets hath it) I hope the printing of
theſe Sermons will take off the wonder, &amp; that they will
be looked upon as in which my <hi>profeſsion</hi> is <hi>concerned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such being the reaſon of bringing theſe Sermons to
<pb facs="tcp:168623:6"/>
the publick view, I ſhall obſerve in the next place with
what injuſtice the <hi>Court-Chaplains</hi> have been accuſed for
<hi>flatterie</hi> and <hi>time ſerving,</hi> for preaching up the Kings <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,</hi>
and <hi>derogating</hi> from the <hi>property</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubject; in which if one or two were faulty, it
ſtands not with the rules of Juſtice, and much leſs of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
that for the fault of one or two (<hi>unius ob culpam
&amp; furias</hi> in the Poets words) a general blemiſh ſhould
be laid on all the reſt. Certain I am, no <hi>flatterie</hi> or <hi>time-ſerving,</hi>
no preaching up the Kings <hi>prerogative,</hi> or <hi>deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
from the <hi>propertie</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubjects will be
found in theſe Sermons, nor could be found in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of mine, had they been ſifted to the <hi>bran.</hi> In confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
whereof, when ſome exceptions had been made
againſt ſome paſſages in one of my Sermons preached
at <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> by a miſtake of ſome that heard it, I offered
the Committee for the Courts of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> before whom
that exception had been ſtarted, to put into their hands
all the Sermons, which I had either preached at <hi>Court</hi> or
in <hi>Weſtminſter Abbie,</hi> to the end that they might ſee how
free and innocent I was from broching any ſuch new
Doctrines as might not be good <hi>Parliament</hi>-proof when
ſoever they ſhould come to be examined: and had they
took me at my offer, certain I am, it might have redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
very much to the clearing of my reputation in the
ſight of thoſe Gentlemen, and nothing to my hurt or
diſadvantage at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:168623:6"/>
In the digeſtion of theſe Sermons I made it my
chief care, rather to inform the underſtanding then to
work on the affections of them that heard me. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for ſeven or eight years before felt the <hi>pulſe</hi> of the
<hi>Court,</hi> and finding that many about the King were not
well principled in the conſtitution of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and thereby gave occaſion to others to think as
ſiniſterly of it as they did themſelves, I thought that
courſe moſt fit to be followed in my preaching, which
was like to be moſt profitable to them that heard me;
for the Underſtanding being well informed, and the
Judgement of men well ſetled on ſo ſure a bottom, I
doubted not but that their affections would be guided
by the light of their Underſtanding, and bring them to
be all of one mind and of one ſoul, like the Chriſtians
in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 32. <hi>Voluntas ſequitur intellectum,</hi> is a <hi>maxime</hi> of
undoubted truth in the ſchools of <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> and holds
good in all the <hi>practical</hi> duties which concern Religion.
Which way of preaching, had it been more generally
followed, (as it might have been) I think it probable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that we might better have kept <hi>the unity of the
ſpirit in the bond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f peace,</hi> then by ſtriving to ſtir up the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
with little or no improvement to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
Knowledg without Zeal may be reſembled
to a candle carried in a Dark-lanthorn or <hi>hid under a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel,</hi>
which waſts it ſelf without giving light to others,
and is uuprofitably conſumed without any benefit to
<pb facs="tcp:168623:7"/>
the publick; but on the other ſide, <hi>zeal</hi> without knowledg
or not <hi>according to knowledg,</hi> may be compared unto the
<hi>meteor</hi> which the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> call an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> which
for the moſt part leads men out of the way, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
draws them on to dangerous <hi>precipices,</hi> or to a
bruſh-Bavine-faggot in a Country Cottage, more apt
to fire the houſe then to warm the chimney.</p>
            <p>So much being ſaid as to the <hi>Motives</hi> which induc'd
me to print theſe Sermons upon the <hi>parable</hi> of the <hi>Tares,</hi>
and to my handling and accomodating that Parable to
the uſe of the Church, as then it ſtood eſtabliſhed by the
Laws of the Land, I am in the next place to let you
know the reaſon why I have made choice of you name
in this <hi>Dedication.</hi> And herein I can make as little uſe of
thoſe common aims, which are ſo frequent in Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of this nature, that is to ſay, <hi>protection, profit</hi> or
<hi>preferment,</hi> as I did before of thoſe common <hi>pretences</hi>
which are ſo frequently alledged for publiſhing many
of thoſe books, which, without any loſs to Learning or
diſadvantage to the Ch. (as before was ſaid) might have
been reprieved from the Preſs. <hi>Protection</hi> I expect none
from you in theſe <hi>perilous times,</hi> in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>, without a prudent
care of your life and actions, you will be hardly able to
protect your ſelf: nor is this dedication made in the way
of gratitude for any <hi>benefit</hi> or profit formerly received
from you, (in which reſpect I dedicated my book called
<hi>Eccleſia Vindicata</hi> to my kind and honoured Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb facs="tcp:168623:7"/>
Mr. <hi>Edward Davies</hi>) or out of any covetous hopes of
being gratified by you with any profit or preferment in
the Church for time to come: of which if I were capable,
I might by the ſame capability return again unto my
own, and being made uncapable, can receive none from
you or from any other; &amp; though, my preſent condition
be not ſuch as to make me the ſubject of any mans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
ſo neither is it ſo mean &amp; deſpicable as to make me
the object of any mans charity. And yet I would not
have it thought but that I have ſome reaſon for this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
and if I had no other reaſon then to give a
publick teſtimony of that dear affection which I
have to your perſon, it neither were without example,
for ſuch as might not juſtifie and endear the action.</p>
            <p>But beſides this I have another reaſon for it that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
my ſelf, which is the leaving of my <hi>picture</hi> with
you, or rather the picture of my nobler part, my
mind; if whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to gather me
unto my Fathers, you may be able to preſerve ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of me. <hi>Patricius</hi> telleth us that the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Diaburranes</hi> the <hi>Scitionian,</hi> being to take leave of her
husband then going to war, drew the chief linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his face with a coal on the wall, and this ſhe
did <hi>ne taedio deſiderii ejus contabeſceret,</hi> for fear leſt ſhe
might otherwiſe languiſh for the want of his company
during his neceſſary abſence. In imitation of which art
it was an ancient cuſtom of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:168623:8"/>
preſerve the <hi>Images</hi> of their Anceſtors and neereſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and ſometimes to advance them in the publick
places of their Cities with an <hi>inſcription</hi> of their nobleſt
actions, of their moſt memorable atchievments, giving
thereby the rewards of vertue to the dead, and brave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
to the living, <hi>ſic et defunctis praemiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, et poſteris dabatur
exemplum,</hi> as <hi>Minutius</hi> hath it Upon the like reaſon I have
ſent you theſe lineaments of my ſoul, not drawn with a
<hi>coal upon the wall,</hi> but (which hath ſom reſemblance to it)
with inke on paper: a portraiture not cut in braſs or
<hi>Parian Marble,</hi> but caſt into a mould of another mettal,
which poſſibly may be as laſting as either of them; and
I have ſent them unto you as (next to your Father) to
my neareſt and beſt beloved Kinſman by my Mothers
ſide, to the end that if any queſtion ſhall be made in your
hearing concerning my ſincerity in the true <hi>Proteſtant
Religion</hi> here by Law eſtabliſht, when I ſhall not be in a
capacity of advocating for my ſelf, you need but bring
them to the ſight of this <hi>picture,</hi> which will ſufficiently
ſerve to ſcatter any of thoſe falſe <hi>reports</hi> which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs
of ſome and the credulity of others may
have faſtened on me.</p>
            <p>It was my happineſs to be bred under ſuch a father as
very well underſtood the conſtitution of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and was a diligent <hi>obſerver</hi> of all publick duties
which were required of him in his place and ſtation.
And though my <hi>Tutor</hi> in <hi>Hart-Hall</hi> (of which Houſe I
<pb facs="tcp:168623:8"/>
was before I went to <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi>) was <hi>biaſt</hi> on the
other ſide, and that I was then very young and capable
of any impreſsion which he might think fit to ſtamp
upon me, yet I carried thence the ſame principles I
brought thither with me, &amp; which I had ſuckt in as it
were with my mothers milk. Nor found I any thing in
all the courſe of my following ſtudies w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> might invite
me to a change of thoſe firſt principles, but very much
which did incourage and confirme me in adhering to
them; according to the which, ſeconded by the beſt light
of my underſtanding, I have acted ever ſince, and on all
occaſions, as eaſily will appear to thoſe who have heard
any of my preachings and conſulted any of my writings
from the firſt to the laſt. In all which I have really done
my beſt eudeavours to ſhow my ſelf a true ſon of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> not looking with one eye toward
<hi>Rome,</hi> or ſquinting with the othr toward <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

keeping both upon the <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>dictates</hi> of the Church
alone, in which I have been bred &amp; have lived ſo long,
and by the grace of God am reſolved to die. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I muſt needs think my ſelf in a ſorry condition in
being forced upon thoſe <hi>helps</hi> for preſerving a fair me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
in the eyes of poſterity; which neither the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of friends (when the publiſhing of theſe Sermons
might have been more ſeaſonable) nor any other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
conſiderations could have wreſted from me.</p>
            <p>I might here end, but that I am to give you an account
of a great <hi>hiatus</hi> which you will find betwixt the 6. &amp; 7.

my former <hi>auditory</hi> which was not, and as it pleaſed God
could not be till his Majeſty and the Court had been ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for ſome time at <hi>Oxon.</hi> There I reſumed my former
argument, becauſe I found there a great part of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>auditors,</hi> &amp; brought theſe Sermons to an end; which
have lain by me ever ſince (without the leaſt alteration in
words or matter) as they then were preached, and as they
then were preached ſo they now are publiſh'd. Which

But to the captious and the curious, to the wiſe and

ſpeech and Parables, to ſet an edge upon their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
and keep them from a loathing of that Manna

            <p>Here then we have a Parable, and another Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and we have reaſon alſo why our Saviour ſpake
at this time in Parables, in matters which concerned
the Kingdom of Heaven: Some other reaſons there
are of it, which we ſhall meete withall hereafter. The
next thing here to be conſidered, is that very King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which in my Text, and other places of this
Chapter, is in ſo dark a way pointed out unto us.
Which Kingdom, whether that it be the preaching
of Chriſts Goſpel, or the imparting of his graces to
the ſoul of man, it is reſembled very fitly unto the
work and travels of the Husband-man, who having
laboured and manured his field with his utmoſt care,
and ſowed it with his choyceſt ſeede, betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
unto his reſt, in expectation of a plentiful and
joyful Harveſt: yet ſo it hapneth many times, that
notwithſtanding all his coſt and travel, it brings forth
tares inſtead of Wheat, weedes inſtead of flowers:
<hi>Longique perit labor irritus Anni.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ovid. met. lib. 1.</note> Gods field is many
times too like his Vineyard; when he had digged it,
and dreſſed it, and that there could be nothing done
unto it which he had not done, yet when he came
and looked for grapes, it brought forth wilde grapes,
ſuch as were only fitted for the Wine-preſſe of his
indignation. So that at laſt the meaning of the Text
will be briefly this, That it ſo falls out with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in the adminiſtration of his heavenly Kingdom,
as with a man that ſowed, and ſowed good ſeed, and
ſowed it in a field of his own poſſeſſion; but at the
comming on of harveſt, found it full of tares. <hi>And he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168623:13"/>
put forth another Parable unto them, ſaying, The
Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hitherto have we gone in the way of preparation,
and ſpake as much as was convenient touching the
ſubject of and in this Parable, the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And in the Predicate thereof, wherein the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Text doth conſiſt eſpecially, we have
theſe parts to be conſidered; <hi>The Huſband-man, the
Seede, the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he was a man of action, for we finde him ſowing; and
next a man of <hi>quality,</hi> as one that did not all his work
by himſelf immediately, but uſed ſometimes the
<hi>ministery</hi> of his ſervants, as may appeare out of the
25. and the 27. Verſe compared together. Then
for the Seed, that is to be conſidered alſo; firſt, in
the ſubſtance, it was Wheat, the beſt kinde of grain,
for the Text tells us of the Tares, that they were
ſowen <hi>in medio tritici,</hi> in the middle of the Wheat;
and ſecondly, it was <hi>bonum ſemen,</hi> a good ſort of
Wheat. Laſt of all for the field, we will look on
that, firſt in it ſelfe, as it is <hi>ager,</hi> a place fit for til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage;
and then in the <hi>Proprietarie,</hi> it was <hi>Ager ſuus,</hi>
his own field, a field not hired nor rented, but his
own poſſeſſion. Of theſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The art of Husbandry is of ſuch antiquity, that it is
attributed by the Poets to the Gods themſelves,
That and the calling of the Shepheard coeval in a
ſort with the very world.<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 2.</note> We read it of the Sonnes
of <hi>Adam,</hi> that <hi>Abel</hi> was a keeper of Sheep, and <hi>Cain</hi>
a tiller of the ground. Both Offices united in the
firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> till his Sonnes came to age to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
them for him: and both united alſo in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168623:14"/>
ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> till he intruſted them to his Apoſtles,
&amp; their ſucceſſors in the Evangelical Preſthood. <hi>Philo</hi>
hath noted to our hands, that the name of Shepheard
was antiently applyed unto Kings and Law-givers,
yet not to Kings and Stateſmen only,<note place="margin">Lib. de Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultura.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

but that it is as juſtly
attributed to the Lord Almighty. But behold, a
greater then <hi>Philo</hi> is here. For Chriſt hath told us
of himſelf that he is a Shepheard, <hi>Ego ſum paſtor
bonus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 11.</note> I am the good Shepheard, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. And his

the chief Shepheard; and <hi>Pastor animarum,</hi> the
Shepheard of our ſouls,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 4. 2. 25.</note> Even that good Shepheard
which did once lay down his life for his Sheep, and
doth ſtill feede them in the paſtures of eternall
life.</p>
            <p>But queſtionleſs, the Husband-man is of the two
the better Gentleman, deſcended, as we uſe to ſay,
of the Elder houſe. And therefore <hi>Philo</hi> in his Book
<hi>de ſacrificiis Cain &amp; Abel,</hi> conceives, that in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution

For Chriſt himſelf hath told us of his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

not that I muſt go about my Fathers buſineſs; and
that what ever thing he doth, he doth it in and by the

word of God. <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſaid his Apoſtle to him, <hi>whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall we go? Thou only hast the words of eternall

a kinde of ſowing, hath been the care and labour of
the heavenly Husband-man from the firſt fall of
<hi>Adam</hi> to this very day, and will ſtill be his care and
labour, from this day forwards to the end of all
things.</p>
            <p>For, the firſt man being fallen almoſt as ſoon as
made, became the moſt calamitous ruine of a goodly
fortune; His underſtanding darkened with the clouds
either of ignorance or error; his will corrupted, and
the affections of the ſame depraved, and his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hardned. So that the Earth and he were both
of the like condition: [Both pure and perfect in
themſelves at the firſt creation; the one being fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
according to the Image of Almighty God, in
Juſtice and Integrity; the other bringing forth of
its own accord whatever thing could pleaſe the eye,
or delight the palate. But preſently upon the curſe,
the Earth was fruitful only in thorns and thiſtles;
and ſo was man upon the fall: thoſe thorny cares
and troubles which afflict the minde, thoſe thiſtles
of corruption which invaded his will and paſſions.]
That ſtood in need of tillage, and ſo did he: the
Plough to work and break the one, that ſo it might
be fit to receive that ſeed which by the careful Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man
is deſigned unto it; the preaching of the
word to prepare the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the reception of the
graces and gifts of God: That required ſowing at
due ſeaſons, and ſo did he; the Earth not bringing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168623:15"/>
forth good fruit without pains and labour, yet yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
good Increaſe of the ſeed allotted; nor man
producing any thing that is juſt and righteous, out of
his own corrupted nature, yet ſometimes bringing
forth the fruits of plety, according to the ſeed ſowne
in him, [<hi>Si modò culturae patientem commodet aurem,</hi>
as the Poet hath it.] Nay, as it ſeemes, theſe ſeveral
kindes of ſowing are of equal date; For when it firſt
was laid as a curſe on <hi>Adam, that in the ſweat of his
browes he ſhould eat his bread,</hi> it alſo was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
as a bleſſing to him, that he ſhould finde relief
in the promiſed ſeed.<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> That the firſt ſeed of faith and
comfort that was ſown in <hi>Adam,</hi> a ſeed of ſo divine
a nature, that it did quicken without dying, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
did give life to all men; a ſeed that ſowed it ſelf
in the Virgins womb, and ſo became the Sonne of
man, that by his meanes poor man might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
from ſin and Satan, and ſo become the
Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>Nor did he only ſowe in the heart of <hi>Adam</hi> the
comfort and aſſurance of the promiſed ſeed; but he
inſtructed him to typifie and prefigurate his death
and paſſion, for the redemption of the world, in the
way of ſacrifice: For howſoever the firſt bloody ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
we read of in the holy Scripture was that of
<hi>Abel,</hi> and that it generally is conceived that he was
taught it by his Father; yet there's no queſtion to
be made, but that <hi>Adam</hi> learnt it of the Lord. <hi>Deus
ſolus docere potuit ut ſe vellet orari,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
hath it. And for thoſe other ſeeds of faith and piety,
by which, or they, or <hi>Seth</hi> or <hi>Enoch,</hi> or any of the
Patriarchs before the Flood, were quickned and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to the works of righteouſneſs, they were all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168623:16"/>
of them ſowne by the Lord our God, ſometimes
by Dreams and Viſions, as the Prophets tell us,
and ſometimes alſo <hi>viva voce,</hi> by a more evident and
perſonal manner of diſcourſe. Many and frequent
were the viſits that God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> after that
he had called him from his own Country, and his
Fathers houſe; and there was none in which he did
not manifeſt ſomething to him of his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
Not to ſay any thing of <hi>Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and thoſe
other good and godly men, to whom the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
and ſpake face to face, thereby implanting in
their ſouls the ſeeds of piety and vertue. But when
the houſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> was grown great and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and had withall degenerated from the example
and integrity of their common Parent, then did the
Lord begin to commit this part of heavenly Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
to his menial Servants, Prophets, and Seers,
Prieſts and Levites.<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 1.</note> For it was he that ſaid to <hi>Moſes,
Theſe are the judgements which thou ſhalt ſet before the

and give them warning from me.</hi> Where we may ſee,
that howſoever God makes uſe of men to diſpatch
this buſineſs, yet they are ſtill Gods words, Gods
judgements, the words of his moſt ſacred mouth,
which they impart unto the people. God ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of this imployment unto his Servants and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that ſtill he kept unto himſelf the power and
reputation of the principal Workman.</p>
            <p>Thus in theſe ſeveral wayes,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note>

made the Worlds.</hi> Himſelf hath told us of himſelf,
in the Expoſition of this Parable,<note place="margin">v. 37.</note> 
               <hi>that he that ſoweth
the good Seed is the Sonne of man.</hi> And indeed, what
was all his life, but a continual ſowing of the word of
God, at <hi>Nazareth, Hieruſalem, Capernaum,</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi>
in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> in the fields and Cities?
Hardly one ſtep in all <hi>Judaea</hi> which he had not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
and in the which he did not punctually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Office of a faithful Seedſ-man. He ſowed
his Word amongſt them, and it brought forth faith;
he ſowed his Grace among them, and it brought
forth godlineſs; he ſowed miracles among them, and
they brought forth followers. And which is yet more
marvellous then all the reſt, he ſowed Himſelf, the
Chriſt among them, and forthwith all the World,
<hi>ab ortu Solis ad occaſum,</hi> as <hi>Lactantius</hi> hath it, did in a
manner become Chriſtians: [he ſowed the very King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

Diſciples did preſently grow greater with Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Kingdom; <hi>Behold, the Kingdom of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

parallel to this, that he that was the Sower ſhould
become the Seed; and the ſame perſon, at and in
the ſelf-ſame inſtant, ſhould be the Preacher and the

unto his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. v. 20. <hi>In locum.</hi>
               </note> yet did he promiſe <hi>to be with them

it with the dew of Heaven, and ſowed it with

wild grapes; if when he ſowes amongſt you his moſt

looks for Wheat; it cannot poſſibly be ſaid, that
God is wanting unto us, but we are wanting unto
God. Nor can it be replyed, (were a man minded to
diſpute with Almighty God) that every man is as
the Lord hath made him, and that the fault is rather
in the ſeed then in the ſoyle: For whatſoever God

Expoſition, [the Children of the Kingdom

ſowed tares, and that the tares are the children of the

wicked men, <hi>quà men,</hi> are the Devils children, ſeeds
of his ſowing, and people of his own creating. And
that might ſerve to uſher in the damnable impiety of
the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who had deviſed two ſeveral Gods, the

that God was not the Authour of ſinne: And he gave

though he were we do not finde that he became the

if he had any, ever attained unto the height
of their Maſters impudence. Some therefore of the
enſuing Hereticks, who in their hearts had entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame opinions, did in their writings recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them to the world in a different habit; for
they had cloaked and clothed this blaſphemy with
the more plauſible and ſpecious titles of deſtiny, and
of the Starres; the moſt inevitable decrees of the

thoſe foul tranſgreſſions which they ſo frequently
committed, it were all one in the true ſenſe and

that they had been as free from the ſuſpicion as the

as not worth the looking after; not in his Vineyard
only, or in his Garden, his Church, the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>The World then is this field, not the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
and in this field, the Sonne of man, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

of Religion, <hi>Deum eſſe,</hi> that a God there is. This
the Apoſtle hath obſerved, that the inviſible things
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168623:23"/>
of God from the Creation of the World, have been
plainly ſeen, <hi>i. e.</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth expound it, <hi>Per viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia

of this, that God was to be worſhipped by
them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and that too in

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Iſocrates</hi> hath it:
nor did they know this only in the general notion,
which might be a remaining ſpark of the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but ſome of them, as <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Tully,</hi> have
written ſo divinely touching the nature, attributes,
and works of God, that they may ſeem to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with the Scriptures: and yet God did not
leave them ſo, as if he had done bountifully for
them in giving them this knowledge that there is
a God, and that this God is to be worſhipped; but
he revealed ſo much of his will unto them, as might
enable them to live in a vertuous manner, or leave
them utterly inexcuſable before God and man. <hi>The
Gentiles</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>which know not the Law, do by
nature the things contained in the Law, which ſhewe the
Law written in their hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing
witneſſe.</hi> Hence it is, that the ancient <hi>Heroes</hi> attained
to ſuch a height in all moral vertues, that for boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
valour, magnanimity, chaſtity, juſtice, and the reſt,
they ſtand ennobled on record unto all poſterity: ſo
that God did his part among them, and ſowed good
ſeed, his ſeeds of knowledge and Religion over all
his field. It was no want in him that they went no
further, that they proceeded not from morall to
ſpirituall graces; the fault was only in themſelves,
who when they had received as much as might make
way for their ambition, or vain-glory, or eſteem with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168623:23"/>
men, caſt off all further progreſſe in the works of
piety, as an unneceſſary burden, of no uſe at all: by
meanes whereof, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth it upon them,
they held the truth of God in unrighteouſneſs, and ſo
became without excuſe.</p>
            <p>Others there were who made no benefit at all of
the ſeed ſown in them, whoſe hearts were waxed
groſſe, their eares dull of hearing, ſuch as had cloſed
their eyes, as it were of purpoſe, that ſo they might
not ſee the great works of God: whence, I beſeech
you, came this backwardneſs, this moſt ſtupid dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
not from the Lord, who is <hi>natura naturans;</hi>
nor from the faulty error and defect of nature, which
is <hi>natura naturata;</hi> but it came meerly from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
from their own evil wills, and corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
their wilfulneſs, or negligence, or both together.
The Lord hath ſo made man, that he hath naturally
in himſelf a power of ſeeing: How comes it then to
paſſe that ſome do not ſee? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſo
ſaith <hi>Theophylact;</hi> there's none ſo blinde as they
that will not ſee, ſo ſaith the Proverb. God gives
men eares, that they may hear; and hearing, may
conceive his moſt holy will: How comes it then to
paſſe that they do not heare, or hearing do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand?
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſaith mine Author, it
was their own fault only that they are ſo wilful: And
being ſo wilful as they were, and ſo regardleſs of the
mercies and grace of God, no marvel if the Lord
withdrew from them his moſt heavenly ſeed, or
ſowed it with a ſparing and leſſe liberal hand. The
careleſſe ſervant in the Goſpel, that hid his talent in
a napkin, and neither did employ it to his own or his
Maſters benefit, not only was rebuked for ſo great a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168623:24"/>
negligence, but had his talent taken from him, and
it was given to one that knew how to uſe it. Gods
field is large, and like a large field it conſiſts of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
parts; ſome places full of ſtones, and ſome full
of thorns, and many times a foot-path, or high-way,
that croſſeth over it: God ſoweth his good ſeed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where over all his Field; but more in ſome parts
then in others; more in the good ſoyle, then in the
ſtony or the thorny-ground, or the high-way ſide;
more in the Church, then in the Synagogue; more
in the Synagogue of the Jewes, then amongſt the
Gentiles, according as it gives increaſe.</p>
            <p>Of this we have a pregnant inſtance in the Jewes
themſelves: the Word of God had been long preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto them, and hearing they did hear, but would
not perceive: the Sonne of God had been long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
among them, and they had ſeen thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that he had performed; which ſeeing they did
ſee, but would not believe. They had aſcribed the
one to <hi>Belzebub; he caſts out Devils by the help of
Belzebub the Prince of Devils:</hi> the other t as Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
and impure a ſpirit; <hi>Said we not that thou art a
Samaritan and haſt a Devil?</hi> both of them ſlighted
and contemned in that ſcornful queſtion, <hi>whence hath
this man this wiſdom, and theſe mighty things?</hi> Such
men as theſe, that had ſo vilified and abuſed the grace
of God, could not but make themſelves unworthy of
a clearer light, then that which might ſhine forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, from a Cloud of darkneſs: <hi>therefore he
ſpake unto them in a Parable, and without Parables ſpake
he not unto them:</hi> not that the Lord envied them a
more perfect ray of his Divinity, he being that light
which lighteth every man that comes into the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168623:24"/>
World: or that he was not willing to impart unto
them ſufficient meanes for their ſalvation, who would
that all men ſhould be ſaved: not ſo, but that he
found by their former actions, how his Goſpel
would be entertained, if it came among them; how
ſtrong a reſolution they had made, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted:
he that had leſſoned his Diſciples, <hi>not to
caſt Pearles before the Swine,</hi> had very ill obſerved his
own direction, had he layed open all the treaſures of
ſalvation to ſuch obſtinate Chapmen, as were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to buy neither milk nor honey, though they
might buy them without money: yet that he might
not leave them deſtitute of all outward meanes, by
which they might attain to the eternal life: he ſpeaks
unto them, though farre off, openeth his mouth to
them, though obſcurely, in dark ſpeech and Parables.
This ſerved to intimate that he was not yet departed
from them, that he had ſtill a care of their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that he would yet be found, if they pleaſed to
ſeek; that even they alſo ſhould finde favour, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the Word of God, if they, as his Diſciples
were, would be ſollicitious to enquire the meaning,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath it: and he himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>They that ſeek
ſhall finde, and unto them that aske, to them it ſhall be
given, to know the Myſterie of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
Thus alſo is it with the Gentiles, with Gods Field in
general, God ſowes it only with good ſeed; but ſo
diſpoſeth that good ſeed, as may be moſt unto his
Glory.</p>
            <p>God ſowes his good ſeed in his Field, over all the
World, although not over all in an equall meaſure;
but the Church only brings forth fruit agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:168623:25"/>
the ſeed ſowne in her; and God rewards this
fruitfulneſs with a further favour, in ſpeaking to her
after a more evident and ſignificant manner, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe that are without. In which regard, the holy
Prophet having ſaid, <hi>that God had ſhewn his word to</hi>
Jacob, <hi>his Statutes and his Ordinances unto</hi> Iſrael,
exults with a <hi>non taliter,</hi> that ſo he had not done unto
other Nations, nor had the Heathen ſo exact a
knowledge of his holy Laws. God ſowes his good
ſeed in his Church, his beſt ſeed in that, <hi>as being
not his Field only, but his Garden too,</hi> (for ſo the Spirit
calls it in the Book of <hi>Canticles:</hi>) and men, we know,
are farre more curious in their Gardens, then about
their Fields: But in this Church, this Garden dreſſ'd
with Gods own hand, there are ſome Plants that
thrive and proſper more then others; and thoſe the
Lord hath choſen to inoculate in the Tree of Life;
<hi>for every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
hath told us, <hi>that it may bring forth more fruit,
John</hi> 15. Let us all therefore have a care in our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
places, that we amend our lives, and yield fruits
worthy of Repentance, that being fruitful of good
works in this preſent Nurſery, we may be all of us
tranſplanted into the glorious <hi>Eden</hi> of eternal life.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now ſpeak of Gods propriety in this Field,
and ſhew that it is <hi>ager ſuus,</hi> Gods own Field alone;
but I have ſpoken of it <hi>ſparſim,</hi> through and in each
part of this diſcourſe, and cannot but perſwade my
ſelfe, that you all know the Earth is his, becauſe he
made it; and the World his, becauſe he governeth
and directs it. And therefore here I will conclude,
beſeeching God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

was there any way to repair thoſe ruines, but by the
preaching of the word, which he hath laboured ever

with little profit. Three parts of that good ſeed

(though in the object miſapplied, and in the

and moſt choyce reveſtries of his Temples. After,
when as the Lord vouchſafed to uſe the Miniſtery
of his Prophets in the compoſing of the Scriptures,
and had ordained that they ſhould openly be read in
the Congregation, his enemy alſo did the like: For

which he procured by his ſuggeſtions to be read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:168623:28"/>
he ſet on work too lewd and ſhameleſs
wretches, <hi>Hierocles</hi> and <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> to write the life
of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi> the Magician. This the moſt

               <hi>inventum

which the enemy went beyond himſelf; for unto
this the project tended, <hi>ut oſtenderent Apollonium vel
paria vel majora feciſſe,</hi> that <hi>Apollonius</hi> had done more
and greater miracles then the <hi>Meſsiah.</hi> When this
ſucceeded not aright, and that Gods holy truth did
notwithſtanding mightily prevail in every place, he
then took order to divulge a Goſpel, as I ſo may
ſay, of his own enditing. This he entituled The true
Hiſtory of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euſeb. hiſt. l. 9. c. 4.</note> though full indeed of
dangerous, falſe, and fooliſh fancies; and wonne ſo
farre upon the Emperors then being, (men fit enough

Schoolmaſters throughout the Empire,

               </gap>, that they ſhould
catechiſe their Scholars according to the Story ſo ſet
out and falſified. So careful is the enemy not to be
wanting to his hopes, but ſtill to be in action, ſtill to
purſue thoſe Arts and Counſels which may advance
him to his greatneſs. If God advance his Chriſt, the
enemy will have his Antichriſt; if God raiſe up his
Jeſus, the enemy will have his Jeſuites; if God be
as a man that ſoweth, or a <hi>Seminator,</hi> will not the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy

            </p>
            <p>I have purſued this Argument, the rather in this
manner, becauſe I would not have the enemy eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
either by his diligence, or by his cunning: not
by his diligence, his conſtant following of the Plough,
his frequent ſcattering of his ſeed; for all his pains,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:168623:29"/>
his ſowing in our Saviours field, and mingling with
the Sonnes of God, tends to this alone, to make
them <hi>filii nequam,</hi> the Children of the wicked one,
fit only for the fiery Furnace: nor by his cunning,
his ſubtile imitation of the wayes and paths of God;
for God himſelf hath told us of him, <hi>that Satan can

No queſtion but it is a Trade more full of
gain then godlineſs, to be continually ſowing in the
fields of other men, to build upon anothers ground,
to range abroad and graze, and fat our ſelves upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

done? only that we would try the ſpirits, whether

expoſition of the Gloſſe confirmed by <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>
where he informs us of a miſery of no mean quality,
like to befall thoſe ſleepy ſouls to whom the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
had left his field; yet not the Prieſt or
Prelate only, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but the people
alſo: otherwiſe, as the Apoſtle ſaid, that if there were
no Reſurrection, then were the Chriſtians of all men
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:168623:35"/>
moſt miſerable; ſo were the Prieſt and Prelate the
moſt miſerable of all other Chriſtians, if all mens
ſins were rated only on their ſcores; and they to
give up an account of every ſoul in their ſeveral char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.<note place="margin">In locum.</note>
Its true indeed, that both <hi>Euthymius</hi> and St.
<hi>Hierome</hi> underſtand here only <hi>magiſtros &amp; praecepto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
eccleſiarum,</hi> the teachers and overſeers of the
Church. And ſo far we may yeeld unto them, that it
is meant of them principally, and as publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
which are to have a care of the common ſafety;
but ſo, that every private man is included alſo in
the Parable. The Devil firſt makes his advantage
of the negligence of private perſons, and whiles
they ſleep ſecure and careleſs, he ſcattereth in their
hearts the ſeeds of Hereſie and error, that ſo they
may be able to infect their brethren. The enemy
never ſends out any of his Foxes to deſtroy Gods
Harveſt, till he put fire-brands in their tails. This
done, he ſeeks occaſion to employ them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the wheat, in the infection of the
Church; and therein alſo makes advantage of the
ſecurity and negligence of their Superiours, of their
Rulers. Theſe the Lords Bayliffs, as it were, to
whom he hath intruſted his holy Husbandry: and if
they ſleep, if once they grow remiſſe and careleſs,
what elſe can we expect, but that theſe tares take
root, and outgrow the Wheat, and in concluſion
overcome it?</p>
            <p>Now in the Church we may obſerve three ſeverall
kindes of ſleepineſs, all of them in their courſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant,
and of ill effect; the ſleep of negligence,
the ſleep of ignorance, and the ſleep of ſenſuality.
The firſt, the ſleep of negligence; and ſo St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:168623:36"/>
doth expound it, <hi>but while men ſlept, i. e.</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>Cùm negligentiùs agerent praepoſiti Eccleſiae,</hi> when as the
Rulers of Gods Houſe grew dull and careleſs of their
Watch, and were not mindful of their duties. This
the diſeaſe, even of the beſt and pureſt Ages; for
which is there almoſt of the Angels of the ſeven
Churches, which is not branded with this mark, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the lives of the Apoſtles, the falling from the
love of Chriſt, the tolerating of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> the
ſuffering of the Woman <hi>Jeſebel</hi> to ſeduce Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
the want of piety in one, zeal in another, and
that poor little ſtrength of faith which was remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the third, what were they but the ſad effects
of dull and negligent ſecurity in the ſeverall Paſtors?
But the Apoſtles being gone, thoſe which did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
the overſeers, there followed by degrees an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious
drowſineſs over all the Church, ſtill more
inclining to this ſleep the more they were accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it.</p>
            <p>The times of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> how watchful were they
in reſpect of thoſe ſucceeding? yet he complains, in
his Epiſtle to <hi>Nectarius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Orat. 46.</note> as if the providence of God
had been quite wanting to his Church. The <hi>Arians</hi>
grown ſo inſolent, that they made open profeſſion of
their Hereſie, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as if they had been

preſumptuous, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they
were formed into a Church, and had a titulary Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

               </gap>, with as much

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168623:36"/>
general connivence, that at laſt nothing would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
him but to have all men elſe to be his Diſciples.
Of all which ſcandalls and diſorders, the ſaid <hi>Necta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

Prelate of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> is there affirmed to be the

that choſe rather, as it ſeemes, to give free way to all
mens fancies, and ſuffer every mans proceedings,
then draw upon himſelf the envy of a ſtubborn Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and a factious multitude. A pregnant evidence,
that poſſibly there cannot be a greater miſchief in a
Chriſtian Church then a popular Prelate: If ſo, if
by the negligence &amp; connivence of one man alone ſo
great a ſpoil was made in the Church of God, how
buſie think we was the enemy in ſowing tares, when
as this negligence was epidemical, and in a manner
univerſal over the people?</p>
            <p>The ſecond kind of ſleep which did invade the
Church of God, was the ſleep of ignorance; a ſleep
of ſuch a generall latitude, that neither Prieſt nor
people were able to hold up, or to look abroad. The
Prieſts lips deſtitute of knowledge, the people ſo
regardleſs, that they did not ſeek it; both ſo defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in their duties, that at the laſt the Prieſt, like
thoſe in <hi>Irenaeus, veritatis ignorantiam cognitionem
vocant,</hi> taught, that the ſafeſt knowledge was to know
nothing; and, as they preached, even ſo the people
did believe: if not, tell me who can what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

ſealed up for many Ages? and had not worldly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy

Devils Harveſt. The Paſtors, careleſs of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
aimed at this eſpecially, that they themſelves
might live in peace, and die, if poſſible, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
love and good opinion of their people. Here
were the tares firſt ſowen, and neither noted in the
ſeed, nor in the blade; for either the opinion taken
up was but the fancy of ſome few, eminent like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in point of learning; or ſome ſuch innovation
in the Churches orders, as ſeemed not in it ſelf to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate
the ſacred truth, or threaten any preſent danger
to the common quiet. And then what was it but a
vain and faulty curioſity, either to quarrel with a
man ſo much renowned in point of knowledge, or to
enquire into their meaning and intentions who loved
the Lord too well to diſturb his Church? By which
connivence, this plauſible and popular beheaviour of
the Watchmen, the enemy firſt entred upon Gods
inheritance; and having ſowen his tares, departed,
went away in good aſſurance of ſucceſs. Afterwards,
when this negligence was lulled into an ignorance,
the tares were grown into a ſtalk, and began to
ſprout; but who was able to diſcern them? <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
counts it an eſpecial happineſs in thoſe dayes of
darkneſs, <hi>ut nullae novae ſurgerent haereſes,</hi> that there
aroſe not in the Church any upſtart Hereſie.<note place="margin">Chronol.</note> And
why ſo great an happineſs, but becauſe that wretched
Age neither afforded learned Scholar to confute
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168623:38"/>
them, nor publick Councel to condemn them? How
much more happy had it been had not thoſe ſeeds of
error which were ſowen before, then took advantage
to ſpring up? had not the darkneſs been ſo great,
like that of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that one ſcarce ſaw another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
roſe any from his ſeat, to look unto the publick
ſafety? But in the end, when as the Prieſt and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
became luxurious and wanton, ſtretched on their
beds of caſe, and lulled aſleep with too much plenty,
then came the tares to bring forth fruit, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in their own likeneſs; yet was there then leſſe
hope then ever. Did thoſe that dwelt upon the
<hi>Nile,</hi> and were accuſtomed to the noiſe, ever obſerve
the fall and roaring of the waters? Or grant we,
that they ſaw theſe tares, and took notice of them,
ſhall we conceive that men ſo drowned in eaſe and
pleaſure would undertake a reſtitution of the ancient
Diſcipline? Was any thing more odious to the Court
of <hi>Rome,</hi> then the attempts that ſome of the more
pious Popes had made of a Reformation? rather like
the <hi>Amyclae,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> people, they paſſed a Law, <hi>Ne
quis de hoſtium adventu famam ſpargeret,</hi> that no man
ſhould preſume from that time forwards to give
them notice of theſe tares, or of the neer approach
of the common enemy. Nay, at the laſt this Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards
Reign ſhall be legitimated by the Common-Councel,
proclaimed to be good ſeed of the Lords
own ſowing; and then what man is he that dare call
them tares?</p>
            <p>In which ſo long a night of ſeveral and diſtracted
ſleepes, in what a wretched ſtate had the Church
been think we, had not the Lord awakened ſome to
have a care unto his field, and to take notice of theſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:168623:39"/>
tares? Once the affaires of <hi>Rome</hi> were brought unto

of the enemy, and ſo awakened all the
World out of that dull ſecurity in the which it was,
how eaſie had it been for Satan to have gained the
Capitoll; yea, to have rooted all the Wheat out of
the field of our Redeemer? But at the laſt the World
awakened, and being throughly awakened, ſome
diſcerned thoſe tares which had ſo long been ſowen
by this ſubtile enemy; and having once diſcerned
them, took a ſpeedy order in many places of Gods
field to weed them out: a thing of great offence to
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which took it very ill to be ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
and ſtartled from their pleaſant ſlumbers.
Marvel it is, that like unto the ſenſual <hi>Sibarites,</hi>
their <hi>Italian</hi> Neighbours too, they baniſhed not all

            <p>For our parts, as we are a parcel of this common
field, it cannot be denied by our greateſt adverſaries,
that from the ſleep of ignorance and ſenſuality we
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:168623:39"/>
have been very well awakened; and we begin to be
awakened alſo from the ſleep of negligence. And
certainly it is high time that it ſhould be ſo, ſtanding
beſieged as we do by two ſeveral enemies; both la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to ſubvert our Church, and to advance their
own in the ruines of it: For, to ſpeak truth, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
quality of our Church may with moſt fitneſs be
reſembled unto that of the Primitive times,
when both the powerful <hi>Arians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the popular <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi>
were both at once in Arms againſt it: or if we
will, we may compare it no leſſe fitly to the State of
<hi>Rome,</hi> during the ſecond Punick Warre. We have
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> upon all the skirts and quarters of
our Empire, calling to minde the Reputation of
their Anceſtors, the great Dominion they have loſt;
and watching all advantages to enlarge their border.
And there is <hi>Annibal ad portas,</hi> a neerer enemy at
hand, at our very Gates, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as
the Father called <hi>Eunomius,</hi> a boſom Traytor, which
grindeth upon our very entrails like <hi>Prometheus
vulture.</hi> One ſide aſſailes openly, and profeſs their
enmity; and by a ſigne diſtinctive, as they pleaſe to
call it, give us to underſtand that they are but tares:
Theſe, like the wild Bore in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> endeavour in
a publick way to deſtroy our Vineyard. <hi>Secretior Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius
Caeſare, non melior;</hi> The other, a more cloſe and
ſecret enemy, doth not ſo much aſſault the Church,
as undermine it; but they aim both of them at the
ſame mark, the ſubjugating of the Church, and
the chief Soveraignty of the State, and have the ſame
end of their journey, although they travel diverſe
wayes. Is this a time think we to ſleep and ſlumber,
and ſtretch our hands in negligence and a careleſſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:168623:40"/>
ſloth? Did ever any Mariner permit his eyes to
ſleep, or eye-lids to ſlumber, ſailing betwixt <hi>Sylla</hi>
and <hi>Charibdis?</hi> Or can we think the <hi>Romans</hi> looked
not then about them, aſſailed at once by <hi>Greece</hi> and
<hi>Carthage?</hi> or that the primitive Chriſtians ſtood not
on their Guard, when both the ſubtile <hi>Arian</hi> and
Saint-ſeeming <hi>Donatiſt</hi> did oppoſe her Doctrine? Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
when men are compaſſed round with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and that they have not only forraign, but dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
enemies, they have good reaſon to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Thus, as we ſee, our dangers are alike on both ſides,
though we perhaps are not alike or equally affected
in apprehenſion of thoſe dangers. On the one ſide, we
think there never can be watch enough, that all thoſe
Lawes and Proclamations which are out againſt
them are not ſufficient to ſecure us, and diſpoſſeſs
us of our feares: And now that his moſt ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
hath given new life unto thoſe Lawes, and by
his royall Edict declared his pleaſure, that no man
ſhall preſume hereafter to practiſe on his weak and
unſetled ſubjects, for the reduction of them unto the
ſuperſtition of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> we think, as
true indeed it is, that he hath ſhewn his zeal to the
Houſe of God, and that we cannot magnifie him as
we ought to do. But on the other ſide, we think
there needs no watch at all, that thoſe few Lawes
and Canons which are now in force for preſervation
of the Churches peace and ſafety, may very well be
ſpared, and layed by for ever. And if his Majeſty
vouchſafe to give command unto his Prelates, to
have an eye unto the unity and uniformity of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Churches, and to reduce them to her primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

luſtre: he is not only ſure to hear of it in thoſe
ſcandalous Pamphlets which every day are offered
to the publick view, but ſhall have many cloſe ill-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
that ſecretly repine &amp; murmur at ſo brave a pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
I wil not ſay from what bad humour this proceeds,
but ſure I am, to ſay the beſt, that it proceeds from
a miſapprehenſion of the Churches danger; and that
we would perſwade our ſelves, that the intentions of
theſe men are harmleſs, and themſelves contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible;
and that their wheat is pure and clean, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dangerous tare amongſt it; but I could tell you,
had I time, and may perhaps take time to do it in
proſecution of this Parable, that they have introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into the Church the ancient Hereſies of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,
Donatiſts, Aerians, Priſcillianiſts,</hi> and the
<hi>Apoſtolici;</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Bardeſanes</hi> and <hi>Florinus;</hi>
which I ſpake of lately: not to ſay any thing of thoſe
dangerous principles which they are known to hold
among them againſt peace and government. High
time aſſuredly both for Prince and Prelate to have

Succesfull miſchief is oft crowned
with the name of vertue; and he is
counted fortunate, whoſe deſignes
do proſper, how wretched and unjuſt
ſoever. The wicked man is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of doing ill, but of being detected; nor doth
he fear the ſin but the diſcovery: this makes them,
as they love to ſin, ſo to ſin in ſecret, as if the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
would conceal their naughtineſs; or if it could
be hid from God, becauſe committed in a corner.
But God from Heaven looks down upon them, and
derides their follies, and brings them at the laſt to
the open light, that howſoever they have ſinned in
ſecret, they may receive the wages and reward of
ſinne in publick. And thus it was with Satan in the
preſent Parable, whoſe foot-ſteps and example his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:168623:41"/>
Diſciples follow. When he intended to deſtroy Gods
Harveſt, he did it in a time of darkneſs, <hi>Cùm dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirent
homines,</hi> when all the ſervants were aſleep.
And that he might be ſure to avoid diſcovery, he
did the feat alone, in private, without any company;
<hi>Venit &amp; abiit,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith the Text, his comming was in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
his departure ſudden, ſo that no notice could
be taken of him when the deed was doing, and not
much neither being done: for he made choice of
ſuch a ſeed to ſow and ſcatter in Gods field, which
was ſo like the wheat in an outward ſhew, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
ſuch a rich increaſe to the heavenly Harveſt,
that it was no ſmall difficulty to diſtinguiſh which
was Gods, which his. And all this while who could
have otherwiſe conceived but that he had been very
fortunate in his undertaking, and his tares good
wheat? but yet at laſt it fell out contrary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
God making a diſcovery of his ſubtile
practices, and manifeſting to his Church the danger
in the which it ſtood. And howſoever that men ſlept
when the ſeed was ſowen, and that they looked not
after it when the blade ſprung up; yet when it came
to bring forth fruit, then their eyes were opened,
and they were able to diſtinguiſh between wheat and
tares. <hi>But when the blade ſprung up, and had brought
forth fruit, Cùm autem creviſset herba, &amp; fructum
feciſset, then appeared the tares alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In handling of theſe words, I ſhall conſider theſe
things following. Firſt, Of what kinde thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
were which were ſowen by Satan, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher'd
here by the name of tares. Secondly, That
there was no way to diſcern thoſe Doctrines, the
falſhood and ill nature of them in the ſeed or ſtalks,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:168623:42"/>
until they came to bring forth fruit. Thirdly, That
every Doctrine of what ſort ſoever doth produce
ſome fruit, by which it may be known whether true
or falſe: and Fourthly, That when the fruits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
then it was eaſie to diſcover of what ſort
they were. Of theſe, or of as many of them as the
time will ſuffer, beginning with the nature of theſe
Doctrines which are here intended.</p>

               <note place="margin">Lactan. <hi>l.</hi> 3. 17.</note> It
was a maxime with the <hi>Epicures,</hi> that no wiſe man
forbears to purſue his moſt wicked counſels, in caſe
they might conduce to profit, and be done with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
A dangerous and moſt miſchievous principle, if
once put in practice; and ſuch as could proceed from
no other Fountain, then the firſt Father of all
falſhood. He indeed had been verſed therein from
the firſt beginnings, even from the firſt attempt that
he made on man; in which he took upon himſelf
the ſhape and title of a Serpent, the moſt ſubtile
beaſt, to work upon the weakneſs of a woman, the
moſt feeble ſex. The profit that he aimed at in that
grand impoſture, was to attain that Empire on the
earth over wretched man which he had failed of in
the Heavens, and amongſt the Angels. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
himſelf ſecure in the undertaking, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of this diſguiſe, and the condition of the party
that he was to deal with. Thus was it then, and thus
it hath been ever ſince. For the old Serpent is no
changeling,<note place="margin">Horace.</note> but ſtill keeps his own, <hi>qualis ab incoepto
proceſſerit,</hi> the ſame Serpent ſtill. God had no ſooner
ſowen his field with celeſtiall ſeed, but ſtraight the
Devil was at hand to diſperſe his tares: by doing
which he might not only ſpoyl Gods Harveſt, but
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:168623:42"/>
increaſe his own. This was the profit that he aimed
at: which that he might be ſure to procure with
ſafety, and not incurre the leaſt ſuſpicion of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
till his croppe was ripe, he did not only watch
his opportunity whiles the ſervants ſlept; but ſowed
the field with ſuch a grain that could not eaſily be
diſcerned when they were awake.</p>
            <p>For tares, <hi>zizania,</hi> if we conſider them according
to the firſt appearance, and in the manner of their
growth, are not much different from the wheat.
<hi>Folio oblongo ſunt, &amp; culmo tritici graciliore,</hi> ſo ſayes

               <hi>Zizania tritico ſimilia eſſe in arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,

the blade or ſtalk, but the fruit alone: So ſaith <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymius
Zigabenus.</hi> Between the tares and wheat,
whileſt they are yet in <hi>herba,</hi> in the blade or ſtalk,
<hi>grandis ſimilitudo eſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Matth. 13.</note> there is no ſmall ſimilitude: So
<hi>Hierome.</hi> Laſtly, To add no more, we are told by
<hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that it was Satans cunning to diſguiſe
his errors under the mask and veil of truth, that ſo
he might more eaſily ſeduce the ſimple, and beguile
the ignorant. And for that very cauſe (ſaith he) he
made choice of theſe tares, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
being ſo like unto the wheat in the firſt
appearing, that it was very hard to know which was
right. [<hi>Tostatus</hi> hath affirmed as much in his work
on <hi>Matthew; Nam herba tritici &amp; zizaniorum ſimilis
est, ſed grana diſsimilia,</hi> the fruit, ſaith he, is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
though the blades be like.] Lay theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
together, and they come to this, that the falſe
Doctrines noted and intended in the preſent Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:168623:43"/>
were ſuch as had a ſhew of truth, and might be
eaſily miſtook for ſound Orthodox Tenets; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterwards diſcovered and examined, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
as dangerous.</p>
            <p>So then the errors and falſe Doctrines which are
noted here, and ſaid to have been ſowen by Satan,
<hi>in medio tritici,</hi> even in the middle of the Church,
were not like thoſe of <hi>Arius,</hi> who denied the Deity,
or of the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> who denied the Manhood of
our Lord and Saviour; or of the <hi>Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niches,</hi>
which blaſphemed the very Majeſty of God
the Father; or of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who quarrelled
the Divinity of the holy Ghoſt: Nor were they, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
like thoſe which had been ſet on foot in the
primitive times by thoſe deſperate writers, who in
their ſeverall turns and courſes had impiouſly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and quarelled every, or any Article of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
faith. Theſe we may rather liken unto briers &amp;
brambles, diſcerned as ſoon as in the blade, or in the
very firſt appearance. The Church ſoon ſpied thoſe
Hereſies, and as ſoon condemned them; nor ever
were the ſervants eyes ſo heavy, as not to note the
time, and obſerve the Authors of thoſe wicked Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
leaving to us upon record the knowledge
and relation of the whole proceedings: ſo that thoſe
wretched and blaſphemous Hereſies wherewith the
Church was exerciſed in the Primitive times, were
generally but like <hi>Jonahs</hi> gourd,<note place="margin">In Pſeudo lo.</note> of a dayes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
or the <hi>Solſtitial Herbe</hi> in <hi>Plautus, quae repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino
ortae ſunt, repentino occidunt,</hi> almoſt as ſoon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
as riſen. Few of them, though they had been
ſowen with all care and cunning, came to take deep
root; fewer to <hi>cùm creviſſet herba,</hi> to the blade or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:168623:43"/>
bloſſom; but none unto <hi>feciſſent fructum,</hi> to bring
forth their fruit, before they were deſcried and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured.
And however ſome of them, as that of <hi>Arius,</hi>
became of univerſall latitude and long continuance,
ſo that <hi>ingemuit orbis,</hi> as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> hath it, the
whole world groaned under the weight and burden
of ſo foule an hereſie: yet did it never paſſe for
Wheat, or was counted <hi>Orthodox,</hi> but ſtill purſued
and execrated as a wicked blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>But for theſe tares, the Doctrines and erroneous
tenets of the preſent Parable, the caſe was otherwiſe.
either the ſervants were not able to diſcern them at
firſt peeping forth; or elſe conceived there was not
ſo much danger in them as in truth there was; or
elſe were willing to believe that poſſibly they might
prove wheat, and ſo become a plentiful addition to
Gods holy Harveſt. For either the opinion taken
up was but the fancy of few, however had in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for their parts and learning, and ſo not
likely to prevail; or ſome ſuch diviſion from the
Churches tenets, as did not ſeem to threaten any
preſent danger to the common quiet, and ſo the
leſſe to be regarded. And this is that which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by <hi>Lirinenſis,</hi> that many errors and falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctriens
had ſecretly been introduced into the
Church,<note place="margin">Cap. 15.</note> 
               <hi>quos nec cito deprehendere valeas, nec facil
damnare fas ducis;</hi> which neither could be ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
nor were thought fit to be condemned on the
firſt diſcovery. By meanes whereof it came to paſſe,
that the ſaid new, but falſe opinions, as they were
ſcattered and diſperſed when no man ſaw them, ſo
they took root when no man marked them. And
when they came to <hi>cùm creviſſet herba,</hi> when it came
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168623:44"/>
to that, and that <hi>the blade ſprung up</hi> and had ſhewn
it ſelf, yet were they ſtill ſo like the wheat, both
in ſhape and colour, that few there were of ſuch a
ſearching and diſcerning eye, as to pronounce aright
from what ſeed they ſprung: nay when they came
unto the triall to <hi>feciſſent fructum,</hi> and that their
fruit diſcovered them to be but tares, yet then
they ſhewed themſelves to the publick view with
ſuch a Copy of old age, and reputation of Antiquity,
that they contended for priority with the wheat it
ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Such are the errors and falſe Doctrines whereof
we challenge and accuſe the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſuch
as a long time paſſed for truth, and were not noted
either in the ſeed or blade. Errors which being ſet on
foot by ſome private men, and having gotten credit
by continuance and long tract of time, were firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
in the Schools as probable; afterwards enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Church as true; and laſt of all, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on mens ſouls as neceſſary. Errors which at
their firſt appearing did not directly, <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
oppoſe the Churches Doctrine, or diſturb her
peace; but ſuch as ſeemed to have upon them the
character and ſuperſcription of ſacred verity, and
grew up <hi>ſenſim ſine ſenſu</hi> with Gods holy truth: we
charge them not with any of thoſe impious blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or wicked hereſies, derogatory to the honour
of our Lord and Saviour, or any other perſon of the
glorious Trinity, or any other common principle of
the Catholick faith, which <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and the
reſt of that damned crew have oppoſed and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
In that they have done bravely for the Church
of Chriſt, and publickly oppoſed thoſe wretched
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:168623:44"/>
hereſies which the <hi>Socinians</hi> have revived in theſe
latter dayes, <hi>Utinam ſic ſemper erraſſent,</hi> would they
had erred thus alwayes, had they erred no otherwiſe,
as once the Cardinal ſaid of <hi>Calvin.</hi> That which we
have to ſay againſt them is, that they have forſaken
their firſt love, like the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and caſt
a ſtumbling-block before the people, like to that of
<hi>Pergamus;</hi> and ſuffered the woman <hi>Jezebel,</hi> which
calleth her ſelf a Propheteſs, to ſeduce Gods ſervants
from the right way of his Commandements, like the
<hi>Thyatirians.</hi> So that the aberration from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
which we charge upon them, is not from the
profeſſion, but the purity of the Chriſtian faith;
not from the outward ſignes and Sacraments, but the
ſincerity and ſoundneſs of Religion; not from the
Church of Chriſt, but in it.</p>
            <p>And yet I would not be miſtaken, as if I thought
there were no Hereſie to be found in the Church of
<hi>Rome:</hi> or that their errors which they teach, were
neither poſitively dangerous in themſelves, nor poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
pernicious and deſtructive to them that hold
them, without true repentance. That which was firſt
an error only, when firſt taken up, in them that taught
it, may by an obſtinate pertinacy become an Hereſie
in them that hold it. Its true, that every deviation
from the truth, or oppoſition made againſt it, doth
not denominate an Heretick: nor doth the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
taking up of a falſe opinion, create ſuch miſchief
to the Church, as the unwillingneſs to lay it down.
Were it not for <hi>pertinaciter defenſa, ſponte electa</hi>
would beare no great ſtroke in the definition of an
Hereſie. This was the caſe between St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and
the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and ſome other holy Biſhops
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:168623:45"/>
of the <hi>African</hi> Churches, conceived rebaptization
to be neceſſary in ſome certain caſes; but modeſtly,
and with ſubmiſſion to the Church of God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
according to his word in Scripture. The <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi>
maintained the ſame opinion, but they did it
obſtinately, refuſed to hearken to the Church, or
to admit of any Judges but themſelves, to decide
the controverſie. The error was the ſame in both,
the Doctrine falſe alike in both; and yet the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi>
ſtand branded for it by the name of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
whereas St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his Aſſociates are
accounted Catholicks. Why ſo? becauſe of <hi>perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciter
defenſa,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> maintained it
with ſo great perverſeneſs, that there was no reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him to the ſound Doctrines of the Church.
And this is that which <hi>Lerinenſis</hi> ſpeaks of with ſuch
admiration,<note place="margin">Cap.</note> 
               <hi>O mira rerum converſio! Authores opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis

            </p>
            <p>This alſo is the caſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the
enemy had ſowen his tares <hi>in agro domini,</hi> and they
ſprung up <hi>in medio tritici.</hi> When they were ſowen
they were not noted; and having taken root, and
put forth the blade, they looked ſo like the wheat,
with ſo fair a ſhew, that very few, if at all any, did
ſuſpect them. And ſo long theſe of <hi>Rome</hi> were in the
ſame condition and eſtate with the <hi>African</hi> Prelates:
either their ignorance or inadvertency might have
ſalv'd the ſore; but when the fruit diſcover'd them to
be tares indeed, and that they notwithſtanding would
defend and countenance them, proclaim them
to be wheat of the Lords own ſowing, ſell them for
ſuch to ſimple people in the open markets, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:168623:45"/>
make them eat (as one may ſay) their own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then fell they into the condition of the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Donatiſt,</hi> and that which was an error only in the
firſt broachers of the Doctrine, is in them made He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.
And here I may repeat that of <hi>Lirinenſis, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thores
opinionis Catholici, ſectatores haeretici.</hi> They
which firſt ſet on foot the opinion, whatſoever they
were, might have no ill intention in it, conceiving
that which they delivered not to be contrary to the
Churches tendries, though perhaps beſides them.
And ſo it might be with them alſo which took
them upon truſt, and aſſented to them, not having
meanes or opportunity to come unto the knowledge
of the truth in thoſe particulars. But ſo it is not
with our Maſters in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have
not only means to know them, and opportunity to
conſider of the fruit they bear; but having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of that long miſtake in which their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
lived, and of the dangers which thoſe tares
do threaten to the Church of God, do obſtinately
ſhut their eyes againſt the ſacred light of truth, and
will not ſee the beames thereof, ſhine they never ſo
brightly: In which eſtate, if they continue wilful
without true repentance, let them take heed leſt
that befall them which my Authour ſpeaks of, <hi>Abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vuntur

them to Gods mercy, &amp; with them the firſt point of
this Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the kind or nature of the Doctr.
which are here intended, proceeding hence unto the
2d, the difficulty to diſcern them in the <hi>ſeed or blade,
until they came to bring forth fruit,</hi> to <hi>feciſsent fructum.</hi>

               <hi>Tertullian</hi> notes it of the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> that they did
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:168623:46"/>
uſe to hide their tenets, and conceal their Doctrines.
A Leſſon taught them by their ſire the Devil, who
when he had a purpoſe to deſtroy Gods Harveſt,
not only did it at a time when the ſervants ſlept, and
in ſo quick a manner that he was not noted, but
ſowed Gods field with ſuch a ſeed, as could not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be diſcerned from the wheat it ſelf, until the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fruits proclaimed it. In all his other projects to
ſubvert the Goſpel, the Watchmen of the Church
ſo traced him, and kept ſo vigilant an eye upon him,
that all his machinations were detected, and his hopes
made fruſtrate: he is reſolved to cheat the very
Watchmen, and therefore ſets on foot ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
in which was no apparent danger, and much
leſſe any viſible impiety; that whileſt the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
let them paſſe, neither examining from whence
they came, nor to what they tended; he might by
them effect his purpoſe with the greater ſafety, and
by degrees endanger and ſubvert Religion.</p>
            <p>And certainly it is no marvel that they ſhould
paſſe without diſcovery, and prevail ſo farre, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
how cloſely the deſign was carried, how little

it did gather ſtrength. For howſoever it be

alteration of Religion, a man may eaſily diſcern both
the change it ſelf, and all the circumſtances that
pertain unto it; yet in the ſowing of theſe tares it
was not ſo. We neither know the Authors, time
or place, by whom, when, where, the ſaid falſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
were firſt broached: nor finde we any that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
them at their riſing up, or whether any did
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168623:46"/>
take notice of them when the blade ſprung up. And
yet it is moſt manifeſt, that ſuch tares there were,
and that they had almoſt corrupted and deſtroyed
the wheat, before the ſervants had eſpied them.
The Cardinalls Rule holds good in all ſudden chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which are made publickly and profeſſedly, and
all at once, in publick and notorious Hereſies, which
come in with violence, and aim at the foundation of
the Houſe of God. And any man of common

and where, the <hi>Macedonian, Arian, Valentinian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
or any of the reſt of ſo high a nature did at firſt

but growes upon us, in us, with us, inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and by degrees. And ſo it is alſo in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in the beginning, working and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
thereof: which with the whole abominations
of it, was to be introduced into the Church, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
and <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> ſo that all might ſee it; but
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168623:47"/>
myſtically, covertly and ſilently, without noyſe or
clamour, ſo that it might deceive even the very
Watch-men. They who advanced this buſineſs,
were ſuch men as thoſe,<note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in
the firſt of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that they ſhould ſpeak all fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood
in hypocriſie. The meaning is, that they
ſhould ſo diſperſe their Doctrines with ſuch a ſhew of
godlineſs, and pretence of piety, that no man ſhould
have cauſe to ſuſpect their doings, untill the very
fruits bewrayed them; and ſo it proved in the event.
That generall aberration from the power and purity
of Chriſts glorious Goſpel, the ſeeds whereof were
ſowen by Satan, even in the lives of the Apoſtles,
was not diſcovered fully till theſe latter dayes: St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> who diligently traced his foot-ſteps, and found
by good conjecture, that he had been ſowing, calls
it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a very myſtery of iniquity.
A myſtery in the ſeed, and in the blade; but in the
fruit thereof a plain iniquity. Had it not brought
forth wickedneſs, <hi>iniquitatem,</hi> it had not been of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
ſowing; and had the working of it been noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and ſenſible to every eye, it had been no my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery;
but it was both, and both together made up
the true nature of it, <hi>myſterium iniquitatis.</hi> That
wicked one in the Apoſtles time did already work,
although he was not then revealed; but in our dayes,
myſtery, which before was written upon the forehead
of the woman, is quite vaniſhed; and there is nothing
to be ſeen at all, but <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great, the Mother
of abominations.</p>
            <p>And I ſaid well, that myſtery was writ upon the
forehead, and not only in a myſtical, but a literal
ſenſe; for <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his notes on the <hi>Revelation</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:168623:47"/>
that in the former times the word <hi>myſterium</hi>
was ingraven in Capitall Letters upon the front, or
fore-part of the Triple Crown; and that it ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
till the Reign of <hi>Julius,</hi> who cauſed the old
one to be broken, and a new one made, and his own
titles, <hi>Julius Pont. Max.</hi> to be inchaſed with Pearls
where the old word ſtood. This he delivereth from
the mouth of D. <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who learnt the ſame
at <hi>Rome</hi> from men of good repute and quality who
had ſeen the ſame, upon whoſe faith we muſt relie
for the truth hereof. But to proceed:</p>
            <p>They therefore much miſtake themſelves, and
the condition of the tares here ſowen by Satan, who
either think they may be eaſily diſcerned as ſoon as
ſowed, or that they will diſcloſe their malignant
nature upon the firſt Eſſay and Triall. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
tells us of theſe tares, that they appeared not
to be tares, till the fruits proclaimed them. And <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
notes,<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> facultate al. mon. <hi>l.</hi> 4.</note> that when ſome covetous and careleſs
Husbandmen, not winnowing their Corn as they
ought to do, had ſold both tares and wheat together,
thoſe which did feed thereon found no diſeaſe, nor
ill effect thereof, at the very inſtant; but that on
the approch of Summer, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
they broke out all of them into biles and ſores.
When therefore he preſcribes this courſe in the way
of diet, that we ſhould carefully caſt away the tares,
and ſift them from our heaps of Wheat, he gives
this reaſon of his counſel; for though (ſaith he)
the inconvenience be at firſt ſo ſmall, that we ſcarce
feel it for the preſent, yet at the laſt, when the ill
humors and corruptions which do thence ariſe, are
grown full and pregnant, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168623:48"/>
then the malignity of their nature doth at large ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
So is it with the juyce of tares, if we drink
thereof, (as ſometimes it is mingled with the Cup
of Life,) it doth not work upon the ſudden: that
poyſoned Cup wherewith the Princes of the Earth,
and the Inhabiters thereof have been made drunk ſo
long together, was of a ſoft and gentle nature, not of
quick diſpatch; tempered according to the neat <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
faſhion: The venom of the ſame being inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
pernicious, brings on death at laſt, and yet we
never feel it working; which briefly we return for a
general Anſwer unto thoſe Cavils of the <hi>Cardinall,</hi>
who therefore will allow no tares to have been ſowen
at all in the Church of <hi>Rome, Eò quòd tempus cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
deſignare non poſſumus,</hi> becauſe we cannot tell
the circumſtances of time, place and perſons, when,
and by whom, and where the Devil ſowed them.
A more particular Anſwer thereunto is neither poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
nor neceſſary in the preſent caſe.</p>
            <p>And firſt it is not poſſible as unto the Author,
which is the firſt and greateſt circumſtance by him
required. All that the Text informs us is, <hi>inimicus
ſevit,</hi> that the enemy ſowed them; and that this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
is the Devil; but by whoſe hands the Devil
did it, what inſtruments he uſed to effect his purpoſe,
as Chriſt our Saviour hath not told us, ſo are we
ſtill ignorant: we finde no further light here then a
<hi>venit, abiit,</hi> that he came ſecretly, and departed ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
he ſtaid not long upon the place; and for
the little time he ſtayed, he took his opportunity,
<hi>cùm dormirent homines,</hi> when all the ſervants were
aſleep, and did not ſee him; and if they did not ſee
him, as tis plain they did not, I would fain know
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168623:48"/>
how they could poſſibly produce him. Beſides, it is
moſt likely that he came diſguiſed in the apparel of
ſome Houſhold-ſervant belonging to the heavenly
Husbandman, having a form of godlineſs, and a
ſhew of zeal; ſo that in caſe the other ſervants had
not ſlept, he might have paſt away without diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The Devil when he came to <hi>Eve,</hi> came not like
the Devil, but in the ſhape of a <hi>Domeſtick,</hi> one of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
Family; and of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> in whoſe ſhape he
came, <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, <hi>abſcondit ſe ſerpens quantum

that he conceales himſelf as much as poſſibly
he can, and ſhews his wit in nothing more then in
finding lurking-holes: nay, ſometimes when he
hath a purpoſe to abuſe poor man, he doth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himſelf into an Angel of Light, his Miniſters
into the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs: and who could
poſſibly ſuſpect any hurt or danger from thoſe who
are accounted Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, or celeſtial
Angels? Nor is the Rule of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſo generally
true in this particular of the Author, but that it will
admit of ſome exceptions; for there were very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Hereſies in the primitive times, acknowledged
and avowed for ſuch in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi>
of the <hi>Gnoſticks, Nazarenes, Ophites, Cainites, Sethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
cum multis aliis,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Epiphanius, Auſtin,</hi>
and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and many other antient Writers, of
which it would extremely puzzle <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and all
his followers in that Church, to produce the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
            <p>So is it alſo with the circumſtances of time and
place in which thoſe hereſies began, which neither he
nor any of the beſt <hi>Philologers</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:168623:49"/>
can aſſigne preciſely, but wander up and down in the
ſearch thereof, as their blinde fancies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
lead them; and ſo the wonder is the more,
that not being able to aſſigne the certainty of time
and place, in publick and notorious Hereſies, which
came in with clamor, they ſhould expect the ſame
from us, in the detecting of thoſe errors which came
in by ſtealth. In their authentick vulgar Latine, there
are many errors, corruptions, tranſpoſitions, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes,
which are by <hi>Cajetan, Senenſis, Oleaſter,</hi> and
the <hi>Engliſh Rhemiſts,</hi> ingenuouſly confeſſed &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.
<hi>Iſidore Clarius,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh Monke,</hi> profeſſeth that
he found no fewer then 8000 errors, ſome of them
very groſſe and palpable. And ſhould we turn the
ſcale, and demand of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> when, in whoſe
time, by whoſe neglect, all the ſaid errors and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
crept into the Text: I trow he would be
fain to anſwer, <hi>cum dormirent homines,</hi> that it was
done when as the Watchmen were aſleep, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to the publick ſafety of the Church of
God.</p>
            <p>So for the circumſtance of place, all that we know,
or poſſibly can know, at ſo farre a diſtance is, that
theſe tares were ſowen <hi>in agro domini,</hi> not in this part
alone, or that; but <hi>in medio tritici,</hi> even in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Wheat, as well in one place as another.
<hi>Dic quibus in terris,</hi> were too hard a taſte for the
beſt <hi>Apollo</hi> in the <hi>Conclave;</hi> and we may ſay, <hi>Qua
terra patet,</hi> when they ask that queſtion. A more
particular deſignation of theſe two laſt circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in all the points debated between them and us,
is a thing impoſſible. The Text informs us, that
theſe tares were ſowen, <hi>cùm dormirent homines,</hi> when
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168623:49"/>
all the ſervants were aſleep; and would you have
them give accompt of time and place, in matters
which were done when they were aſleep? Such an
accompt indeed they might ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e given, as did the
Souldiers in the Goſpel of our Saviours body, who
gave it out, and ſtood to it, like brave men of arms,
that his Diſciples came by night, and ſtole it whilſt
they were aſleep. A very likely tale I promiſe you;
for if they were aſleep, as they ſaid they were, how
could they tell, that either any body came to
ſteal him, or that the Lords Diſciples were
the men that did it? <hi>Adeo mendaci rum natura
eſt, ut cohaerere non poſsunt,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lactantius</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>Beſides, thoſe errors which we note in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they came in privily, ſo they grew up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly.
And firſt of all they came in privily, there
being not only many errors, but even damnable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,
which came in privily and by ſtealth, as St.
<hi>Peter</hi> tells us. <hi>There ſhall ariſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in thoſe dayes, that privily ſhall bring in damnable
Hereſies, ſectas perditionis,</hi> as the <hi>Latine</hi> reads it. The
Devil in this point is like the <hi>Peacock;</hi> as he is <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus
in penna,</hi> and can transform himſelf into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of light, when he thinks it neceſſary: ſo is he
<hi>pede latro</hi> too, a creature of a ſilent and a theeviſh
gate, when he ſees occaſion. It is no eaſie tracing of
him in his private paths. Secondly, thoſe errors as
they came in privily, ſo they grew inſenſibly, like to
the finger of a Diall, which we finde varied from the
place where before it was, and yet we do not ſee it
vary; for ſo do private mens opinions, if they be but
probable, gain by degrees we know not how, on the

affection and good liking of particular perſons, and
after on the approbation of the Church it ſelf, till
in the end of <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> they became to be counted
<hi>School-points,</hi> then taken, or miſtaken rather, for the
traditions of the Church; and finally received as
Articles of the Chriſtian faith. The holy Ghoſt
hath ſaid of Chriſt, that he is a Rock, <hi>Petra autem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
Chriſtus,</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles; and Chriſt hath
told us of the Confeſſion of his faith, that it is a
Rock, <hi>ſuper hanc petram,</hi> in St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel.
Now one of thoſe four things which ſeemed ſo
wonderful and unſearchable in the eyes of <hi>Solomon,</hi> is
<hi>via ſerpentis ſuper petram,</hi> that of a Serpent on a
Rock; or, if you like the Application, that of the
Devil, in ſubverting the faith of Chriſt: nor is it
thus only in the points of faith, but in that of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
which by degrees, inſenſibly, and without
obſervation, have very much declined and varied in
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from what they were in their
original inſtitution, there being many things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of a good intent, as one amongſt themſelves
complaineth, <hi>quae nunc videmus partim in abuſum,
partim in ſuperſtitionem verti,</hi> which are now
changed into abuſe, and altered into ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But yet the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſtayes not here, we muſt
enquire, <hi>quis eam oppugnaverit,</hi> what men oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
theſe new opinions, and made head againſt them
at their firſt appearance, or elſe all is loſt. A Quere
not more capable of reſolution than the others
were; for if the Authors were not known, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
private, and that there is no <hi>Conſtat</hi> of the
time or place, when, and wherein the ſeeds were
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:168623:50"/>

were an excellent folly. And it is plain, that in the

the Wheat; but when they came to fructifie, to
<hi>feciſſent fructum,</hi> and that the fruits did yield the
leaſt ſuſpicion to the vigilant ſervants of an enſuing
miſchief to the Church of God, then did God ſtir
up ſome to take notice of them, and to give warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the reſt of the common danger: if not, tell
me what <hi>Caveats</hi> had been entred in the Churches
name, by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, againſt the Doctrine of
the <hi>Popes</hi> ſupremacy; by <hi>Berengarius,</hi> againſt that of
the carnall preſence; by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and all
his <hi>Clergy</hi> in the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Frankford,</hi> againſt the

grant their own perſonal errors) againſt the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> both in
faith &amp; manners? Nay, if we thought that that would
pleaſe him, we could tell the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> out of <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerius,</hi>
one of the <hi>Popes</hi> Inquiſitors, that there have
never wanted ſome ſince the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
that have oppoſed the errors of the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> the names of whom who liſt to ſee, may
finde them in <hi>Catalogus teſtium veritatis,</hi> with their
times and qualities: ſo that the <hi>Cardinall</hi> might
well have ſpared this bold expreſſion, <hi>non ſolum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores

men alone, had been faſt aſleep, had he not in ſo
many ages ſtirred up one or other to make reſiſtance

We are all ſinners from the womb, but are then
moſt ſinful, when we are ſeaſoned with ill Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
and that the poyſon of our education is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added

which others did upon compulſion, and for fear of
law. How much more operation think we have thoſe
Doctrines on us, which come apparalled in the habit
of Religion, and the Cloak of piety? on a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the which we are perſwaded, that all our
comforts do depend for the preſent life, and all our
hopes for that to come. Aſſuredly theſe precepts
and inſtructions which we take from them, whoſe
words and dictates we imbrace as celeſtial Oracles,
are of power incredible, either to make us fit for
miſchief, or to inable and prepare us for the works
of goodneſs: ſo that in caſe there were no other
way to know what leaders we have followed, and
what inſtructions have been given us, the fruits of
our affections would at full declare it.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is, becauſe of that dependence which
the affections have on the underſtanding, that which
the underſtanding apprehends as true, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to the will as good, and forthwith by
the will deſired and followed: ſo that as often as
the underſtanding is deceived in its proper object,
and entertaineth falſhood inſtead of truth, ſo often is
the will miſguided, in courting thoſe things which
indeed are wicked, but yet are clothed in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of diſſembled vertue: upon this ground St. <hi>Paul</hi>
hath told us of the Gentiles, that having their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
darkned through the ignorance which was
in them, <hi>they gave themſelves over unto laſciviouſneſs,
to work all manner of uncleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 19.</note> If ſo,
if that ſo ſad effects did follow upon the darkneſs of
the underſtanding, no queſtion but the miſperſwaſion
wherewith ſometimes it is effected, produce more
wretched conſequents in our outward actions; for if
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:168623:52"/>
the underſtanding be depraved with falſe opinions,
the will moſt commonly is led aſide by vain affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the errors of the ſame being farre more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
becauſe more active. Now there is nothing
entertained in the underſtanding which is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to it by the outward ſenſes, <hi>Nil eſt
in intellectu quod non priùs fuit in ſenſibus,</hi> ſay
the old <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> And of all outward ſenſes,
there is none more ſerviceable to the underſtanding
then the ſenſe of hearing; for <hi>Fides ex auditu,
Faith is by hearing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. By meanes
whereof it comes to paſſe, that as we preach, even
ſo the people do believe; and as they do believe,
even ſo they practiſe. Take we heed therefore what
we preach, and that we ſowe not tares among
ſimple men, who cannot know them from the
Wheat.</p>
            <p>Now of the tares I told you in my laſt Diſcourſe
from <hi>Galen, Plinie, Theophraſtus,</hi> and many of the
beſt of our modern <hi>Herbalists,</hi> that they affect the
ſight with dimneſs, and the head with giddineſs, and
the whole body with Diſeaſes: And ſo it is alſo
with the falſe opinions, thoſe dangerous and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Tenets intended in the preſent Parable; for in
our eyes, (conceive we of our underſtanding) they do
occaſion ſuch a dimneſs, that either we cannot ſee
the way that leads to happineſs, or ſeeing, ſee the
ſame, but will not perceive it. And in our heads it
doth produce ſo great a giddineſs, that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
unto nothing, halting, as once the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
between two opinions, divided betwixt God and
Mammon, in great diſtraction with our ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we ſhall adhere to Chriſt, or follow Antichriſt;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:168623:53"/>
continue in old <hi>England,</hi> or hoyſt ſail for <hi>New.</hi>
And for the ſores upon the body, the blemiſhes of
our behaviour, the ſtains and ſcandalls of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
by which we grieve the Spirit, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
Religion, what are they but the frequent,
though moſt lewd effects of a perverted underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and a poyſoned will?</p>
            <p>The Hereſies of the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> and the <hi>Carpocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
what vile and wretched things they were! A
man might eaſily conjecture what fine points they
held, by the condition of their lives, which were ſo
filthy and obſcene, that for their ſakes the name of
Chriſtian firſt grew odious to the ſober Gentile. <hi>Vide
Chriſtianos quid agunt, In illis patitur lex Chriſtiana
maledictum,</hi> as devout <hi>Salvian</hi> oft complained. The
errors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in point of judgement
have they not bred as grievous errors in the points of
practice? Whence elſe proceeds it that the Prieſts
are debarred from Marriage, and permitted Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines;
that open Stewes are ſuffered and allowed of,
ſo they pay rent unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſupply his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers;
that Princes may have diſpenſation to forſwear
themſelves, and break thoſe Covenants which they
have ſolemnly contracted with their confederates;
that ſubjects may take arms againſt, and depoſe
their Princes, if the <hi>Pope</hi> do but ſay the word, and
free them from the Oath of their Allegeance? And
on the other ſide, when we behold men factiouſly
bent to oppoſe the Church, ſeditiouſly inclined to
diſturb the State, diſloyally reſolved to reſiſt their
Soveraign, rebelliouſly diſpoſed to excite the people;
when men refuſe to pay the King his lawful tributes,
and yet conſume them on their luſts; when they let
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:168623:53"/>
looſe ſuch rogues as <hi>Barrabas,</hi> that they may crucifie
their Lord and Maſter; may we not certainly affirm,
that they have hearkened to the Doctrines of <hi>Knox</hi>
and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and their ſucceſſors in the cauſe? Such
as the Doctrines are which the eare takes in, ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
are the lives which are framed thereafter. <hi>Cavete
itaque quid auditis,</hi> take you heed therefore what
ye hear, leſt whileſt you lend an eare to thoſe
falſe Apoſtles, you partake with them of their
ſins.</p>
            <p>And certainly there is good reaſon why we ſhould
take heed. The Devil never was more buſied in
ſowing of his tares, then now; nor ever had he bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opportunity to effect his purpoſe. So dull and
ſleepy are men grown <hi>circa cuſtodiam propriae perſonae
ſuae,</hi> in reference to themſelves and their private ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that they are angry with the <hi>Prelates</hi> for being
ſo vigilant and careful <hi>circa cuſtodiam gregis ſui,</hi> and
having more care of them then they have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
ſo that if Satan be but diligent, as no doubt
he is, and ſend his inſtruments abroad, as no doubt
he doth, he may diſperſe his tares ſecurely, and bring
them to <hi>feciſſent fructum,</hi> ere they be diſcovered.
And how comes this to paſſe, but for want of heed,
for want of taking heed what it is we hear, and unto
whom it is we hearken, Falſe? factious and ſchſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Doctrines are the ſeeds of Satan; and many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
he hath, both in the Pulpit and the Parlor,
to diſperſe thoſe ſeeds: ſome ſpeaking evil of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and deſpiſing Dignities; others perverting
of the people, and forbidding to pay tribute unto
<hi>Caeſar:</hi> ſome taking up proviſion of the choiceſt
wits, and perſons of moſt power and quality for the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:168623:54"/>
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and others leading out whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
to ſeek the Goſpel in the Deſert. He that
doth look for better fruit from ſuch dangerous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
then diſcontent and murmuring againſt their
Rulers, aſſociations and conſpiracies againſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Government, and finally, a flat Apoſtaſie from
the ſincerity of that Religion which is here profeſt,
may as well look for Grapes from Thorns, or Figs
from thiſtles. <hi>A good Tree bringeth forth good fruit;</hi> but
for theſe evil Trees which bear evil fruit, what are
they profitable for but for the fire? that as they are
the cauſe of combuſtions here, they may adde fuel
to the fire hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thus have I brought you at the length to that
which did occaſion the diſcovery of the Devills
practiſe. The ſowing of theſe Tares, the <hi>Sevit</hi> we
had ſeen before: We have now took a brief view of
them in <hi>creviſset herba,</hi> and brought them to <hi>feciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
fructum.</hi> There remains nothing further but
<hi>apparuerunt,</hi> that they appeared, and how they were
diſcovered; but that muſt be the work of another

a Serpent in the graſſe, <hi>anguis in herba,</hi> in the tares,

him for ſome certain ſpace to let the enemy rejoyce,
and admire himſelf in the ſucceſs of his deſignes, yet
it held not long; for when his hopes were higheſt,
and his tares well grown, ſo that they ſeemed to
have preeminence of the wheat it ſelf, then did
the Heavenly Husbandman awake his ſervants, and
let them look upon the tares in <hi>feciſsent fructum,</hi>
when they appeared to be what indeed they were,
<hi>infelix ſolium, frugum peſtis,</hi> and whatſoever other

            <p>The words you ſee are very few, and ſo the parts

theſe two particulars. 1. That the tares appeared
at laſt, <hi>apparuerunt &amp; zizania;</hi> when, or how they
were diſcovered, and that we finde in the word <hi>tunc,</hi>
then when the blade had brought forth fruit. Of
theſe in order, begining what the <hi>Quod ſit</hi> firſt, and ſo
proceeding to the <hi>Quando.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Veritas non quaerit angulos,</hi> Truth ſeeks no corners,
ſaith the Proverb: And therefore Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

which ſhewes it ſelf unto the eye of each beholder.
We may affirm thereof, as doth St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> of the

                  </gap>t</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,</hi>
we ſhall ſee hereafter, when we ſhall come to
ſcan thoſe motives which might induce the Lord to
permit theſe tares; <hi>Sinite utraque creſcere, uſque ad
meſſem,</hi> v. 30. Mean while it doth concern us to take
ſpecial notice, that as it pleaſed the Lord to give
way to error, and ſuffer ſometimes hereſies of an
higher nature, and ſometimes falſe opinions of an
inferior quality to take faſt footing in his Church;
yet he did never ſuffer them to deſtroy his harveſt,
but brought them at the laſt to <hi>apparuerunt.</hi> The
comfortable beams of truth diſperſed and ſcoured
away thoſe Clouds of error wherewith the Church
before was darkened, and by the light thereof the
foulneſs and deformity of falſhood was made more
notorious: ſo that from hence two ſpecial Queres
may be raiſed, firſt, why theſe tares or errors were
ſo long concealed; and ſecondly, how they were at
laſt revealed.</p>
            <p>And firſt they were concealed as it were of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to let the Church take notice of her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
how careleſs and how blinde ſhe is in the
things of God, did not the eye of God watch over
her, and direct her goings. Her careleſneſs we had
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:168623:56"/>
before in <hi>dormirent homines,</hi> when as we found her
ſleeping, and regardleſs of the common enemy; that
time the tares were in their <hi>Sevit,</hi> and no man would
hold up his head to look unto the publick ſafety.
Her blindneſs we may note in this, that being left
unto her ſelf, ſhe could not ſee them in <hi>creviſſet,</hi>
when they put forth the leaf, and the blade ſprung
up, and that they did begin to ſpread abroad, and
juſtle with the truth for the preeminence. If either
no falſe Doctrines had been ſowen at all, or had they
all been noted at the firſt peeping forth, the Church
might poſſibly impute it to her own great watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
pleaded ſome ſpecial priviledge of infallibility,
and ſo in time have fallen into preſumption. God
therefore left her to her ſelf, that falling into ſin and
error, and ſuffering both to grow upon her by her
own remiſſeneſs, ſhe might aſcribe her ſafety unto
God alone, whoſe eyes do neither ſleep nor ſlumber.

our Fathers might be ſafe in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and may be now triumphant in the Church of
Heaven, though they believed thoſe Doctrines
which were therein taught, or poſſibly maintained
them with their beſt affections. The errors of that
Church were not then diſcovered, nor brought to
their <hi>apparuerunt;</hi> and being taken or miſtaken for
ſound Orthodox Tenets, were by them followed
and defended in their ſeveral ſtations. So that we
may affirm of them as once St. <hi>Peter</hi> of the Jewes,
<hi>novimus quia per ignorantiam fecerint,</hi> we know that
through ignorance they did it: or if we know it not
ſo clearly as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did, yet we may charitably
hope that it was no otherwiſe, in thoſe particular
points and paſſages wherein we know not any thing
unto the contrary. He that makes any doubt of this,
what faith ſoever he pretends to, ſhewes but little
charity, and makes no difference between an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
and a wilful blindneſs. There are ſome errors
in the Church, like ſome Diſeaſes in the body; when
they are eaſie to be cured, they are hard to be known;
&amp; when they are eaſie to be known, they are hard to
cured; but every error &amp; diſeaſe is of that condition
that it muſt firſt be known, &amp; the true quality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:168623:57"/>
But ſo it is not now with us, nor any of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was anciently with
our fore-fathers in and of that Church. Thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
which in former times were accounted truths, or

them with Scripture, the true rule of faith, are
able to demonſtrate the obliquity of thoſe opinions
and falſe Doctrines which they have thruſt upon the
Church in theſe latter ages. And we may ſay of

in the new Creed of Pope <hi>Pius quartus,</hi> and
thoſe which were delivered once unto the Saints in

they neither came from the Apoſtles, nor any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Spirit: ſo that in caſe we ſhut our eyes againſt
the ſacred beames of truth which now ſhine upon us;
or if they ſo long after the <hi>apparuerunt</hi> will not ſee
thoſe tares which are diſcovered to their hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both
we and they are all <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, utterly uncapable
of excuſe in the ſight of God. If any man will be
ſo obſtinately wedded to his own opinion, as to take
up his Lodging in a Peſt-houſe, after he hath been
made acquainted with the preſent danger, however
we in charity may ſay, Lord have mercy upon him;
yet he hath reaſon to believe, that God in juſtice will
inflict that judgement on him which uſually doth
befall thoſe men which do wilfully and perverſly
tempt the Lord their God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:168623:57"/>
Nor was it only neceſſary in regard of us, of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and particular men, that the tares ſhould come
to their <hi>Epiphanie,</hi> their <hi>apparuerunt;</hi> God did it
moſt eſpecially for his Churches ſake, whom he had
promiſed to conduct in the wayes of truth, and to be
with her alwayes to the end of the world. The tare
is in it ſelf, as the Poet calls it, <hi>infelix lolium,</hi> a
wretched and unlucky weed, and <hi>frugum peſtis,</hi>
the bane and plague of other grains, as the
learned <hi>Herbaliſt.</hi> And of the miſchief which it brings
to Gods holy Husbandry, either by eating up the
wheat, the Lords own good ſeed, or over-running
all the field in the which it growes, I have at large
diſcourſed already. Suffice it that the Devil ſowed
them with a devilliſh purpoſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that ſo he might deſtroy the labour of the
Heavenly Husbandman. And doubt we not but that
he had in fine effected his malicious ends, had not
God brought them in due time to <hi>apparuerunt;</hi> had
he not made a plain diſcovery of their noxious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and called upon his ſervants to take notice of
them. We may conceive what reputation they had
gained by a longer ſufferance, how ill it would have
gone with the Church of God in the attempt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
in that being ſo long ſince detected, and
brought to their <hi>apparuerunt,</hi> ſo many in the world
are not yet perſwaded that there was any thing in
point of Doctrine fit to be reformed. It is with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
now, as with temples anciently; the more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
they have the greater ſanctity, <hi>Tantumque
ſanctitatis tribuerunt quantum vetuſtatis,</hi> as <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Felix.</hi> God therefore took his time to detect
theſe errors, and to give notice to the world, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:168623:58"/>
they were but tares, before they could preſcribe to
truth, or challenge ſuch an intereſt in antiquity, as
was not poſſible to be diſproved.</p>
            <p>And this the Lord did partly for his own ſake too,
that ſo he might acquit himſelf of thoſe gracious
promiſes which he had made unto his Churches,
and by that meanes became her debtor. He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be with her alwayes, and therefore could not
poſſibly forſake her in her greateſt need: He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to conduct her in the wayes of truth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not leave her as a prey to error. He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that the gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt
her, and therefore could not give her over to the
ſnares of Satan. God never doth forſake his Church,
though he ſometimes leaves her to her ſelf for her
further trial; nor turn away his face, though he look
aſide, for her correction and chaſtiſement; for
ſhould he utterly deſert it, and leave it as a prey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſin and error, the Church indeed were in a very
ſory taking; but in the mean time, where were all
Gods promiſes? Might not the enemy rejoyce, and
advance his head, and ſay that either God did not
ſee his practiſes, or was not able to prevent them?
that he was only rich in promiſes, <hi>promiſsis dives,</hi>
but when it came to the performance, then <hi>Quid dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
tanto?</hi> And might not his moſt truſty ſervants
have complained with <hi>David, Ut quid Deus repuliſti
in finem. O God wherefore art thou abſent from us ſo
long? we ſee not our tokens, there is not one Prophet
more, no not one is there among us that understandeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more.</hi> This the Lord heard, but would not ſuffer.
And therefore when he had made trial of his
Church, and let her ſee her own infirmities, he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:168623:58"/>
brought thoſe errors and falſe Doctrines which did
ſeem to threaten it, to their <hi>apparuerunt,</hi> to the open
light. And of falſe Doctrines, many are of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that being once diſcovered, they are ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
<hi>majorque aliquanto labor eſt invenire quàm vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi>
How this was done, and when, we muſt next
conſider, which for the time thereof was <hi>tunc,</hi> and
for the manner of it, in <hi>feciſſent fructum;</hi> my next
particular, and next in order to be handled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rectum eſt ſui index &amp; obliqui.</hi> There is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way to diſcern any thing thats crooked then by
laying it to a right line; or to diſcover errors and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Tenets, then to compare them with the
truth. Truth doth not only juſtifie it ſelf, but by the
light thereof we are made more able then before to
judge of falſhood. And howſoever many falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
have paſſed, and ſtill may paſſe for currant, in
the conceit of thoſe which have took them up; yet
by comparing them with Scripture, which is truth it
ſelf, or with the Catholique tendries of Gods holy
Church, the beſt Expoſitor of Scripture, their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and their falſhood will at once appear. Thus was
it with the tares in the preſent Parable; They ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo lovely to the eye in the blade or ſtalk, that
few were able to diſcern them. Moſt took them to
be Wheat of the Lords own ſowing, a very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
piece of Wheat, and ſuch as might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced
the labour of the heavenly Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
but when they came unto <hi>feciſſent fructum,</hi>
when both the Wheat and tares came to bring forth
fruit, and that the fruits of each were balanced in the
ſcale of the holy Sanctuary, then was it no great
difficulty to determine of them, to ſay that this was
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:168623:59"/>
Wheat, and that theſe were tares; that this was
truth, and that was error; that this was ſeed of Gods
own ſowing, the <hi>bonum ſemen</hi> mentioned in the 24.
and for the others, <hi>unde haec?</hi> they could proceed
from none but <hi>ab inimico.</hi> So true is that which
Chriſt our Saviour tells us in another caſe, <hi>igitur ex
fructibus eorum cognoſcetis eos,</hi> by their fruits you
ſhall know them. As for example;</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of the Popes ſupremacy, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to us in the faireſt colours, how ſpecious
ſeemes it to the eye, how neceſſary for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of peace and unity in the Church of God?
how excellent a piece of Wheat would a man ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it at firſt looking on? Nature pleads for it, in
regard that all living Creatures, as Bees and Birds,
and Sheep and all other Cattel love to have ſome

Church, and other learned men may refer their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies:
unity muſt begin from one; and who
more fit to be this one, then he that can derive unto
himſelf ſo faire a title?</p>
            <p>And a faire title tis indeed, and hath been ſo well
pleaded by the Advocates of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that
for long time together there was no ſuſpicion that
it would ever come in queſtion whether true or
falſe. So fair a field could bring forth nothing but
the pureſt Wheat, the bread of life, even manchet
for the Lords own Table. He that had thought or
given it out that there was any tare amongſt it, much
leſſe, tares all over, might poſſibly have had ſome
hearers, but few believers. The reaſon was, becauſe
that all this while the Doctrine was but in <hi>creviſſet
herba,</hi> in the blade or ſtalk; not come unto the
height, to <hi>feciſſent fructum.</hi> But when it came to
that, and that the fruits thereof appeared in their
proper likeneſs, it proved to be ſo groſſe a tare, ſuch
an <hi>infelix lolium,</hi> ſuch a <hi>frugum pestis,</hi> that a more
dangerous was never ſowen by Satan in the Church
of God. For then it was diſcovered plainly, that the
Popes in a manner had forſook the claim of being
ſucceſſors to <hi>Peter,</hi> and would be Vicars unto Chriſt;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:168623:60"/>
that they had changed <hi>Quodcunque ligaveris in terra,</hi>

and Prophetical power into the Kingly; and built
their riſe not on the priviledges which Chriſt gave

or <hi>Vice-Deus?</hi> as in the Inſcription of <hi>Paulo
Quarto Vice-Deo:</hi> others with that of <hi>Dominus noſter

as did <hi>Card. Bellarmine;</hi>
               <note place="margin">De R. P. l. 4. c. 5.</note> others, to make a new
Creed, and coin new Articles of Faith, as did <hi>Thomas
Aquinas:</hi> and finally ſome of them having gone ſo

<hi>niſi unum post ſe talem vicarium reliquiſſet,</hi>
had he not left behind him ſuch a Vicar, ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endowed with all manner of power, as did <hi>Peter

            </p>
            <p>So for the Popes themſelves,<note place="margin">De Jurisd. Eccl. c. 7.</note> when they had lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the foundation of their Grandeur on thoſe words
of Chriſt, <hi>Omnis poteſtas data eſt mihi,</hi> how quickly
did they turn that primacy which before they had in
point of order, into a ſoveraignty or ſupremacy in
point of power? with what ſubtile blaſphemy did
they ſhift the Scriptures, to make them ſerviceable
to their wicked and ambitious ends? Inſtead of <hi>Tibi
dabo claves,</hi> one findes out <hi>ecce duos gladios,</hi> behold
here two ſwords, the one ſpiritual, the other tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
And thereupon Pope <hi>Julius</hi> paſſing over <hi>Tiber,</hi>
drew out his ſword, and threw his keyes into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
affirming openly, that ſince St. <hi>Peters</hi> keyes

for an Authority that he might kill, aſſaſſinate, and
murder diſobedient Princes; and by the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
for ought I can ſee, he may eat them too.
And finally to mend the matter, the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
thus founded and promoted by ſuch wretched
ſhifts, mnſt be reputed as an Article of the Chriſtian
Faith; and that too <hi>primus &amp; praecipus Romanenſium

Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> certain I am, that ſo it was defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the time of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, &amp; hath
been ſince ſo ranked and marſhalled in the new
Creed of <hi>Pius Quartus.</hi> Add unto theſe their practiſe
in the points aforeſaid, proclaiming errors to be truth,
and publickly condemning truth for errors; making
new Articles of Faith, and miſinterpreting the old;
depoſing Kings, diſpoſing of their Kingdoms, and
bringing them to be at their devotion; and tell me
if the ordinary fruits of the Supremacy do not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it moſt manifeſtly for a dangerous tare.</p>
            <p>Next for the ſingle life of Prieſts, when it firſt
ſprung up, how lovely ſeemed it to the eye? how
few had reaſon to ſuſpect that it was a tare? <hi>Paul</hi>
ſeemes to advocate the cauſe, wiſhing that all men
were as he; affirming alſo, that for the preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
it were good for all men ſo to be;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 7.</note> that the
unmarried cares more for the things belonging to
the Lord, how he may pleaſe the Lord, then the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:168623:61"/>
married doth. The Fathers many of them are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
copious, if not hyperbolicall, in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Virginity; eſpecially after that <hi>Jovinian</hi>
ſeemed to undervalue it, <hi>fideliumque matrimoniorum
meritis adaequabat,</hi> and made it of no greater merit
then a vertuous Wedlock. Which general Rules of
the Apoſtle became appropriated to the Clergy,
firſt, by conforming thereunto of their own accord,
as a matter voluntary: next, by the Authority of
the Fathers, who recommended it unto them for a
more perfect ſtate of life then that of marriage;
but left it howſoever as a matter arbitrary. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ages
finding out further motives to endure the
buſineſs, as <hi>viz.</hi> that being freed from domeſtick
cares they might more readily attend Gods ſervice,
more conſtantly purſue their ſtudies, more bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
cheriſh and relieve the poor, but ſpecially that
they might more chearfully infeoffe the Church
with their poſſeſſions, it came at laſt, inſenſibly and
by degrees, to be impoſed upon them as a matter
neceſſary. By meanes whereof the ſingle life being
generally imbraced by Clergymen in theſe Weſtern
parts, it grew in time to be diſputed whether ever it
had been otherwiſe in the Church of God. And in
concluſion it was determined, that however in ſome
caſes the Clergy were permitted to retain thoſe
Wives which they had taken before Orders, yet that
the Examples of men married after Orders were
exceeding few, if at all any could be found.</p>
            <p>Thus was it in the blade or ſtalk, &amp; no fault found
with it. But when it came to bring forth fruit, to <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſent
ſructum,</hi> then the caſe was otherwiſe; and it
appeared, that howſoever continency and virginity
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:168623:62"/>
were the gifts of God, yet the reſtraint of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
was a tare of Satans; for what did follow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
but that the Clergy grew infamous by their
frequent luſts? <hi>Panormitan</hi> complaining, <hi>pleroſque coitu
illi cito commaculari; Caſſander</hi> publickly affirming,
<hi>ut vix centeſimum invenias,</hi> that hardly one amongſt
a hundred did contain himſelf within the limits of
his Vow: the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> withall maintaining, that
Clerks were not to be deprived for their inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
<hi>cùm pauci ſine illo vitio inveniantur,</hi> the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
being grown ſo univerſal that it was thought
uncapable of any remedy. I willingly paſſe by their
unnatural luſts, for which they ſtand accuſed in the
Poet <hi>Mantuan; venerabilis ara cynaedis ſervit,</hi> and
that which followeth after; nor will I tell you of
the Fiſh-pond in Pope <hi>Gregories</hi> time, wherein were
found the skulls of 6000 Infants, <hi>ex occultis fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus
&amp; adulteriis ſacerdotum,</hi> conceived to be the
tragical effects of their looſe affections. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that theſe things were known, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
complained of by ſuch devout and conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men as obſerved the ſame, yet to ſo high an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie
did they come at laſt, that <hi>John</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
of <hi>Cova</hi> preaching at noon againſt the marriage
of Prieſts, was the night following taken in adultery;
and Cardinal <hi>Campegius</hi> in the Diet of <hi>Norimberg</hi> did
not ſhame to ſay, that it was more lawful for a Prieſt
to have many Concubines, <hi>quàm vel uxorem unam
ducere,</hi> then one lawful Wife. And why was all this
ſuffered think you? upon grounds of piety? no, but
in point of policy, to uphold the Popedom. For
when this matter was debated in the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ncel of
<hi>Trent,</hi> and that the Prelates there did not ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:168623:62"/>
to eaſe the Clergy of that heavy, but more
ſcandalous yoke; the Pope returned his abſolute
Negative, and was much offended that they had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it to come in queſtion. Why ſo? becauſe
that Church-men having Wives and Children, to be
as Hoſtages or pledges for their good beheaviour,
would become more obnoxious to the ſecular pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and more obedient to the pleaſure and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of their natural Princes; <hi>adeoque Pontificem
redigere ad ſolius Romae Epiſcopatum,</hi> which would
in fine prove prejudicial to the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
and limit his Authority to the Walls of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fruits thus palpably diſcovering the true
condition of the Doctrine, begat withall a ſhrewd
ſuſpicion that poſſibly the reaſons commonly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
in defence thereof might be weak and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And upon ſearch it did appear that the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of St. <hi>Paul</hi> were general, and did no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Clergy then all people elſe; ſome of them
being only fitted to the preſent time, and therefore
not to make a rule for all future Ages: that though
the Fathers magnified and extolled the ſingle life,
they impoſed it not; or if they did, it was not more
upon the Clergy then upon the Laicks: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that Pope <hi>Siricius,</hi> who impoſed it firſt, could
find no Text in Scripture whereupon to ground it,
and therefore moſt prophanely wreſted and abuſed
that place, <hi>Qui in carne ſunt non poſſunt placere Deo,</hi>
to make it ſerviceable to his wretched ends. And it
was alſo found on further ſearch into antiquity, that
this reſtraint of marriage being propoſed unto the
Fathers of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> was by <hi>Paphnutius</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:168623:63"/>
and the ſounder part of that great Synod openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected;
that it was neither new nor ſtrange to marry
after holy Orders, <hi>Eupſychius</hi> a Biſhop of the <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docians,</hi>
whom <hi>Althanaſius</hi> highly praiſeth, taking a
Wife after he was advanced unto a Biſhoprick; and
of a Bridegroom inſtantly become a Martyr, <hi>dum
adhuc quaſi ſponſus eſſe videretur,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Tripar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite</hi>
Hiſtory. The like, as to the point of marrying
after holy orders, <hi>Vincentius</hi> tells us of one <hi>Phileus,</hi> an
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Prelate. The ſame may alſo be made good
not only in the Eaſtern Church, where the Prieſts
are not yet debarred from marriage after Orders
taken, as it is noted on the Gloſſe on <hi>Gratian;</hi> but
for 1000 years together in theſe Weſtern parts. So
lately it was before the Clergy were generally min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to yield to that ſlaviſh tyranny: nor was it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
on more mature deliberation, that marriage in
and of it ſelf did any way diſable men from Gods
publick ſervice, the ſtudying of the holy Scriptures,

               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they
were every way as eminent in all acts of godlineſs
as thoſe that did profeſſe virginity.</p>
            <p>Which, with the wretched conſequents before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
being taken into conſideration by our
firſt Reformers; and being it was obſerved withall
that the reſtraint depended upon poſitive Lawes, no
Divine Commandement; the wiſdom of this State
thought fit to take away thoſe poſitive lawes on the
which it ſtood, and leave it arbitrary as at firſt. And
this they were the rather induced to do, by reaſon
that the rigorous neceſſity of a ſingle life had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:168623:63"/>
affrighted many a man of parts and learning
from entring into holy Orders, and filled the Church
with ignorant and infamous perſons. By meanes
of which indulgence granted as before, the gift of
continency is become more eminent in them that
have it, &amp; without reproch to them that want it. The
freedom which the Church hath given in the uſe of
chaſtity, makes the vertue greater; no vertuous action
being commendable if it be not voluntary. And
ſince the granting of this liberty in the point of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
how many of each order hath this Church
produced, <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> that have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the ſingle life out of choyce, not force? with
far more honour to themſelves, and greater luſtre to
the Church, and a more gracious acceptance with
Almighty God, then if it were impoſed upon them
by a poſitive Law. Of whom we may affirm with

Schools entituled <hi>hyperdulia,</hi> being a kind of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
inferior unto that of God, but greater then
may be communicated to the other Saints. The
Church in the beginning had been exerciſed with
many Hereſies touching the incarnation of our Lord
and Saviour: The <hi>Valentinians</hi> hold that he took
not from her his humane nature, but brought it with
him from the Heavens; with whom concurred <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollinaris,</hi>
and the <hi>Secundiani. Neſtorius</hi> on the other
ſide affirmed, that he who was born of her was the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:168623:64"/>
Sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> but by no meanes the Sonne of
God: and therefore he allowed not that ſhe ſhould
be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Mother of God, but only
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the Mother of Chriſt. <hi>Helvidius</hi> and
the <hi>Antidico-Maritan</hi> had a further reach, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
her the glorious title of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
with like impudence and ignorance, <hi>eam poſt
Chriſtum natum viro ſuo fuiſse commixtam,</hi> that
after our Redeemers birth ſhe was known by <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
In which reſpects, both to reſtore her to her rights,
and to depreſs thoſe Hereticks that had ſo debaſed
her, the Fathers have conferred upon her many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
attributes; but yet no more then ſhe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Hence is it that we finde the Titles of
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Mother of God, perpetual
Virgin. Hence is it that St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> a moſt zealous
perſecutor of the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> faction, calls her <hi>preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſum
totius orbis theſaurum, &amp;c.</hi> the moſt rich Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the World, a Lamp that cannot be put
out, the Crown of Chaſtity, and very Scepter of true
Doctrine; <hi>ſceptrum rectae Doctrinae,</hi> and not the
Scepter of the Catholick Faith, as our <hi>Rhemists</hi>
render it. Which honorarie attributes not being
given, (nor poſſibly appliable) to any of the other
Saints in true antiquity, as they proceeded then
from a juſt neceſſity, ſo were they afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
without juſt offence. For who could reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive but that a greater reverence muſt be
due to her then any other of the Saints, whom God
had ſanctified and ſet apart for ſo great a bleſſing,
as to be the Mother of her Saviour?</p>
            <p>Hitherto <hi>omnia bene,</hi> for what hurt in this? what
ſoul ſo dull in her devotions, ſo cold in her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:168623:64"/>
to our Lord and Saviour, as not to magnifie the
Womb which bare him, and bleſſe thoſe papps that
gave him ſuck? Who could ſuſpect that poſſibly
there ſhould be any tare in ſo fair a Field? who could
ſuppoſe that any warrantable honor done or tendred
unto the Mother of our Lord (as <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſtyled
her) did not redound unto the Sonne? And certainly,
as long as thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> contained themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the limits of the ancient Fathers, and that <hi>O quàm
te memorem virgo!</hi> their pious flouriſhes, Rhetorical
Apoſtrophes, and devout Meditations went no
higher then a Religious commemoration of her life
and piety, they did not more then what had warrant
from the Scripture and the Angel <hi>Gabriel; Benedicta
tu mulieribus</hi> would have born all that: nor had it
done much hurt, had they ventured further, even
to <hi>nec vox hominem ſonat,</hi> and made her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more then mortal, had they tarried there. But
when they could not ſtop in the full careire, and
would needs hold it out to the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her Queen of Heaven, and call her by the name

            <p>This that we may the better ſee, and ſo diſcern

<hi>Bernardin Senenſis,</hi> one of her eſpecial votaries, doth

Chriſt in being his Mother, then Chriſt hath done
to all Mankind in being their Saviour: That <hi>Gabriel
Biel,</hi> a School-man of good note and credit, hath
ſhared the Government of the World betwixt God
and her, God keeping juſtice to himſelf, <hi>miſcricordia
matri virgini conceſſa,</hi> and left to her the free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing
of his mercies. That <hi>Petrus Damian</hi> tells us,
that when ſhe mediates for any of her Supplicants
with our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>non rogat ut ancilla, ſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat
ut domina,</hi> ſhe begs not of him as an Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,
but commands as a Miſtreſs: that <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
in compoſing of our Ladies <hi>Pſalter,</hi> hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to her what ever was intended by the Holy
Ghoſt for the advancement of the honour of our
Lord and Saviour: and finally, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath
made no difference between the veneration due to
her, and that which doth of right belong unto Chriſt
as man. Add unto theſe their uſage of the vulgar
ſort in point of practiſe, ſaying ſo many <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
for one ſingle <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> hearing ſo many
Maſſes of our Lady, and not one of Chriſts; deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Images with all coſt and cunning that mans
wit can reach, when his poor Statues ſtand neglected,
as not worth the looking after. Theſe, and the reſt
if we ſhould add, what could be imagined but that
the Apoſtles were miſtaken when they made the
<hi>Creed;</hi> and that it was not <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but the Virgin-Mother
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:168623:65"/>
that ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
dead and buried for the ſin of man?</p>
            <p>You ſee then what moſt monſtrous tares have
grown up in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> under the new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
of <hi>Hyperdulia.</hi> Let us next ſee what their
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> carrieth with it, what a ſtrange multitude of
tares that one word doth carry. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> makes
this difference between the termes, <hi>hanc ſanctis cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris,</hi>
that that belongs indifferently to all the
Saints, <hi>illam humanitati Chriſti &amp; matri ejus;</hi> but
this alone to Chriſts humane nature only, and his
bleſſed Mother. The ground of the diſtinction, and
how they differ from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or indeed rather how
they differ not, we ſhall not canvaſſe for the preſent.
Suffice it that in this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they comprehend both
prayers to Saints, and adoration of their Images. And
firſt for prayers unto the Saints, the Fathers taught,
according to the word of God, that the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
pray for us, as fellow-members with them of
that myſtical body whereof Chriſt Jeſus is the head.
Which as it is unqueſtionably true of the Saints in
general, ſo was it thought by <hi>Maximus Taurinenſis,</hi>
and that not improbably, that of the Saints none
were more conſtant in it then the holy Martyrs, <hi>qui
&amp; ſupplicia pro nobis pertulere,</hi> who ſuffered death for
our incouragement and confirmation. In this regard
the faithful of the primitive times uſed to repair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Tombs, and did there offer up their ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to the Lord their God; next, ventured to
implore the Lord to grant them their deſires and
prayers, even for the bleſſed ſake of thoſe Saints
and Martyrs at whoſe Tombs they kneeled; and
in the end began to implore the Martyrs to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:168623:66"/>
their prayers to the Lord Almighty, for their
more quick diſpatch in the Court of Heaven. By
which degrees came in the invocation of the Saints,
and ther with that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that Religious worſhip of
them which the Schools maintain, and is defended
for good Doctrine in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Doctrine, of what ſort it is, whether wheat
or tare, muſt be determined by the fruits: and if we
bring it once to <hi>feciſſent fructum,</hi> the true condition
of this Doctrine will at full appear. For what did
follow hereupon, but that the Saints were made our
Mediators at the Throne of Grace? every man
chooſing ſome or other of thoſe bleſſed Spirits to
be his Advocate and Interceſſor with Almighty
God; our Saviour Chriſt meanwhile neglected, or
but little thought of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay, they went ſo far at the
laſt, that Chriſt was fain to mediate with the Saints,
as if their paſſions, and not his, had been the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
cauſes of Redemption: as in that prayer of the
Portuice touching <hi>Thomas Becket, Chriſte Jeſu per
Thomae vulnera quae nos ligant relaxa ſcelera.</hi> Nor
ſtayed they there, but as they made their prayers
unto them, ſo did they come at laſt to make their
vowes, not by but to the Saints departed; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
to dedicate unto their proper and immediate
ſervice, Temples, and Feſtivalls, and Altars, and ſet
forms of worſhip; which being all materiall parts and
circumſtances of religious adoration, and ſo confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be even by thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath ſo plunged
poor ignorant people into groſſe and palpable Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
it having been the conſtant Doctrine of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
that all religious worſhip, of what ſort ſoever,
is ſo peculiar unto God, that without manifeſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168623:66"/>
it cannot be communicated unto any creature.
And howſoever thoſe of wit and learning have
found a mentall reſervation to deceive themſelves,
yet that will prove no plaſter for the general ſore, nor
ſave the common people from the down<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> right ſins.
The <hi>Cardinall</hi> indeed thus reſolves the caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Licet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
S. Petre miſerere mei, &amp;c.</hi> that it is lawful for
us men to pray unto S. <hi>Peter</hi> to have mercy upon
us, to ſave us, and ſet open to us the Gates of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to grant us health and patience, and what elſe
we want, <hi>modò intelligamus his precibus &amp; meritis,</hi> if
ſo we underſtand it thus, Do all theſe things that I
requeſt by thy prayers and merits. But this I would
fain know of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> with all his wit, how many
of the vulgar ſort have ever learnt or practiſed ſuch
a reſervation; or if they have, how farre it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
and excuſe the ſin.</p>
            <p>So it is alſo in the point of Images, firſt introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into the Church for Ornament, hiſtory and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
<hi>Sic &amp; defunctis praemium, &amp; poſteris dabatur
exemplum,</hi> as <hi>Minutius</hi> hath it. Had they ſtayed
there, it had been well, and no fault found with
them. They might have uſed them ſo <hi>ſans queſtion,</hi>
and therewithall have given them that reſpect and
reverence which properly belongs to the ſimilitude
and repreſentations of celeſtiall things. Poſterity
had never queſtioned them or their proceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngs in
the point, had they gone no further. But when the
Schools began to ſtate it, that <hi>idem honor debetur
imagini &amp; exemplari,</hi> that the ſame veneration
was to be afforded to the Type and Prototype,
then came the Doctrine to the growth, to <hi>feciſſet
fructum.</hi> When, and by whom, and where it was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:168623:67"/>
firſt ſo ſtated, it is not eaſie to determine, and indeed
not neceſſary. It is enough that we behold it in the
fruits. And what fruits think you could it beare, but
moſt groſſe Idolatry, greater then which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
known amongſt the Gentiles? witneſs their
praying, not before, but to the Crucifix, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on the very Croſſe, the wooden and materiall
Croſſe, both to increaſe their righteouſneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their ſins. <hi>Auge piis juſtitiam, &amp; reis dona ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam,</hi>
as the <hi>Porteſst</hi> had it. Nor could we look for
better fruit from ſo lewd a Tenet, it being defended
in the Schools, that the Image of Chriſt is to be
worſhipped with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the higheſt kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
in their own opinion, <hi>cum Chriſtus adoretur ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione
latriae,</hi> becauſe that kind of Adoration doth
properly belong to Chriſt our Lord. And for the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
of the Saints, they that obſerve with what
laborious Pilgrimages, magnificent proceſſions, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
offerings; and in a word, with what affections,
prayers, and humble bendings of the body, they have
been &amp; are worſhipped in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> might
very eaſily conceive that ſhe was once again relapſed
to her ancient Paganiſme.</p>
            <p>Its true, the better to relieve themſelves in this
deſperate plunge, they have excogitated many fine

The holding back of Scripture from the common
people, and celebrating Gods divine ſervice in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Tongue, what fruits do they afford but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Gods holy pleaſure, and blind obedience to
the precepts of ſinful men, and coldneſs in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of devotion; and finally, contempt of
Gods word, and whole Commandements? The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualizing
of their own Traditions with Gods holy
word, according to the Canon of the late <hi>Trent</hi>-Councel,
what fruits doth it afford but contempt of
Scripture? The Doctrine of that Church in the
point of merit, what fruits doth it produce but high
preſumption? or that of tranſubſtantiation, but moſt
groſſe Idolatry? or that of half Communion, but
moſt horrible Sacriledge? Such fruits, if all meanes
elſe ſhould fail us, would ſerve ſufficiently to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
and declare their noxious nature, and thereby
make us able to determine of them, though none at
all obſerved them when they were in <hi>ſemine,</hi> and
few were able to diſtinguiſh them, when they were
in <hi>herba: Nam quod latebat in herba manifeſtatur
in ſpica, &amp; quod celatur in germine aperitur in
fructu,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> on the Text.</p>
            <p>You ſee by this that hath been ſpoken that there
are other meanes ſtill left us by Gods infinite mercy,
to know Gods Seed from Satans, the good Wheat
from tares; beſides the obſervation of time, place
and perſons, <hi>Ex ſructibus corum cognoſcetis eos,</hi> by
their fruits ye ſhall know them, ſaith our Saviour.
And yet the triall of theſe tares is not made only
by the fruits; the fruits firſt brought them to <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruerunt,</hi>
made them plain and viſible, and brought
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:168623:68"/>
them to appear in the open Court. But having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
their appearance, they were to be examined,
tried and judged by the word of God. The Lord
hath given it for a Rule, <hi>ad legem &amp; teſtimonium</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
in all doubtful controverſies, we ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

Saviour being asked his judgement touching the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of Divorce, refers himſelf to the firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſaying, <hi>Ab initio non fuit ſic,</hi> it was not ſo in the
beginning. So that whoever can demonſtrate from
the Book of God, that either the Doctrine or the
practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> differeth from that
which was firſt preached and publiſhed by our bleſſed
Saviour, and the holy Apoſtles, doth manifeſtly
prove a change therein; nay prove as forcibly
that they have departed from the rule of Faith,
which was once given to the Saints, as if he could,
or did demonſtrate all the circumſtances, when, and
by whom, and in what Country, every particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation

            <p>This they object; and what ſhall we return for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer?
We will be more ingenious, then they are to

the needleſs trouble of looking after the particulars
of time, place and perſons. Too true it is, that ſome
amongſt us, though not of us, have ſet on foot thoſe
Doctrines, and purſued thoſe practiſes, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a ſcandal to our Reformation and further will
diſhonour it, and in time ſubvert it, if care and order
be not taken to prevent the miſchief. We ſee them
in their fruits already, and that hath brought them

The firſt degree of happineſs is not to
ſin: The ſecond, to be ſenſible of a
fault committed. It had been well done
of the ſervants in the preſent Parable,
to have been careful in their Maſters buſineſs, and
not have given the enemy advantage by their dull
ſecurity, for the diſperſing of his tares. And it was
well done, although not ſo well, that they diſcerned
them in good time, before they had deſtroyed Gods
Harveſt, and devoured his Wheat. A fault had been
committed by their ſloth and drowſineſs, that they
ſaw too well; but every man was willing to excuſe
himſelf,<note place="margin">Vill. Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culque.</note> and caſt the blame upon his fellow. <hi>Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um

ſaid <hi>Velleius</hi> rightly. And tares they ſaw ſprung up
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:168623:70"/>
which they had not ſowen; but how they came
there, that they could not tell: certain they were,
that they had ſowen good ſeed in their Maſters
Field, and that the Field was well manured, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for ſo great a bleſſing. To ſee this Field ſo dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and cultivated, overgrown with tares, and to be
ignorant withall what malicious hand had plotted
and performed ſo great a miſchief, muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
both wonder and amazement in their doubtful
mindes: therefore as well to ſatisfie their Maſter,
that they had ſowen good ſeed in his bleſſed Field,
according unto his appointment; and to be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves, whence thoſe tares ſhould come, they
came unto the Houſholder, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,

            <p>In our diſcourſe upon this Text, I ſhall preſent
you with an Explication, and an Application: an
Explication for the Text, an Application for the
time. In the firſt general, the Explication, we ſhall
behold the ſervants of this Parable in their addreſſe
unto their Maſter, and their conference with him. In
the next general, the Application, we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
a diſcovery of thoſe tares and errors which have
been ſowen by Satan in this Field of God. And firſt,
we muſt begin with the Explication, and therein
with the matter of addreſs. <hi>Sic accedentes ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how they came there,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who it was that ſowed them,

Himſelf, our bleſſed Saviour, gives them more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to have recourſe to him in their doubts
and difficulties. <hi>Ego ſum via, veritas &amp; vita, I am
the way, the truth, and the life,</hi> John 14. The ſervants
of my Text need not make a queſtion, either of
finding out the truth, which they were in ſearch of,
or gaining life eternal, which they ſought by truth:
when he which was the Journies end, was the way
alſo. And therefore in my minde St. <hi>Bernard</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcants
very pretily on that Text of Scripture; <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

quia eſt via; ad Chriſtum, quia eſt vita.</hi> Let us walk
after Chriſt, becauſe he is the truth; by Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is the way; to Chriſt, becauſe he is life.
St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> alſo gives us a good hint for our direction
in this journey, both for truth and life; <hi>Non eſt quò
eamus niſi ad te, non eſt quà eamus niſi per te; Whither
O Lord ſhall we repair but to thee? and which way ſhall
we come unto thee, if we come not by thee?</hi> The Servants
here were well acquainted with this way, they knew
none better, that howſoever God inhabits <hi>in luce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſsibili,</hi>
in light inacceſſible, yet he was eaſie of
acceſs unto them that fear him; and therefore <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedentes,</hi>
they came unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accedentes autem ſervi,</hi> So the Servants came.
The ſervants in the plural number, they came not
one by one to make their own excuſe apart, they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:168623:72"/>
came all together. They had been faulty all alike,
and therefore if a check were feared, good reaſon
they ſhould be all partakers of it. The <hi>Heathen Orator</hi>
thought it an equitable point,<note place="margin">Tull. pro Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cello.</note> 
               <hi>ut qui in eadem cauſa

had been intereſſed in the ſelf-ſame buſineſs, ſhould
beare their equal ſhares in the ſelf ſame fortune; but
this was not the buſineſs that they were in queſt of.
Their errand was, not only to be ſatisfied upon the
<hi>unde haec zizania,</hi> whence the tares ſhould come; but
to enquire their Maſters pleaſure, what he thought
ſitting to be done on the diſcovery, <hi>vis i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; colligimus ea?</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 28.</note> as it follows after: this
was indeed a weighty buſineſs, ſuch as required a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
unanimity, and a joynt aſſiſtance. The refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Church is no eaſie work, nor to be
undertaken by a ſingle man. It is a buſineſs that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
much help, and many hands, and all thoſe
hands to work together to one end, God bleſſing
their endeavours by his Grace and Spirit. <hi>Tacitus</hi>

                  </gap>bant,</hi> becauſe
they never held together, never communicating for
the common ſafety either their counſels or their
purſes. I hope we never ſhall again commit that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
though there be dangerous Symptoms of it,
the ſervants of my Text may inſtruct us better: who
howſoever they had done amiſſe by their former
drowſineſs, in giving Satan opportunity to ſowe his
tares, yet now they are reſolved to combine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the preventing of all further miſchief. <hi>Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes

            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:168623:72"/>
Well, they are come, and well come, what comes
after next? <hi>Dixerunt ei,</hi> they ſay unto him, it

            <lg>

               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>looking on one another who ſhould firſt begin. They
ſaw the Church in no ſmall danger of approching
ruine, by the quick ſpreading of thoſe tares; and
conſequently, thought it fit to know truly how the
matter ſtood: not that he needed to be told, but
that he looked that they ſhould tell him. The Lord
knowes our neceſſities before we ask, yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
that we ſhould call upon him in our ſervent
prayers. He knowes more of our ſins and frailties
then we do our ſelves, and yet he hath enjoyned us
to confeſſion. And this he doth, to keep on foot an
intercourſe between Heaven and Earth, to rouze
our ſpirits, and inflame our zeal, and quicken our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.
<hi>Dixerunt ei,</hi> they ſaid unto him, and that
too in the plural number; What, ſpake they all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as they came together? I believe not ſo:
God is the God of order, not of confuſion. They
therefore which repair unto him, muſt come unto
him in an orderly and decent way: ſo that it is moſt
likely that they had ſome Speaker, who had in
charge the repreſenting of the common buſineſſe;
or that they ſpake by turns, as occaſion ſerved. And
yet they are all joyned <hi>in dixerunt</hi> here, to ſhew that
howſoever they had many tongues, they had all one
voyce; or that whoever ſpake, ſpake the mindes of
all. Such unity of hearts and tongues is to God moſt
grateful, being the beſt expreſſion of the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace.</p>
            <p>We muſt not reſt upon the <hi>quod ſit,</hi> that they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168623:73"/>
came and ſaid, we muſt examine next what it was
they ſaid. They craved acceſs upon no other ground
and motive, but to come to conference. That was
the thing moſt aimed at in the <hi>accedentes,</hi> in their
coming to him. Now in the Proeme to this confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
they propoſe two queſtions: firſt, <hi>Domine, nonne
ſeminaſti bonum ſemen? Sir, didſt not thou ſowe good
Seed in thy Field?</hi> next, <hi>unde haec zizania? whence
then hath it tares?</hi> In one of theſe there was no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
needful; for none knew better then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that God had ſowen it with his choyſeſt Seed,
ſo picked and cleanſed, and fit for his ſacred Field,
that there was neither weed nor tare amongſt it.
Themſelves had laboured and manured it, and ſowed
and harrowed it, according to the rules of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Husbandry. In which reſpect, St. <hi>Paul</hi> not only

with God. God looking on, bleſſing the
piety of their endeavours, and giving his increaſe

ſtand with our Saviours Comment, who in his
Comment on this Parable hath made the
reaping of the Corn, not the ſowing of it, for the
work of Angels. This queſtion therefore being
asked by thoſe that knew how to anſwer it, may
paſſe amongſt thoſe <hi>data,</hi> matters of conceſſion,
which are required in many Sciences. Queſtions or
Interrogatories in the Book of God are oftentimes
equivalent to affirmations, not propoſed as
doubts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:168623:73"/>
But for the other queſtion, <hi>unde haec Zizani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> that
was indeed a true <hi>quaeſitum,</hi> a doubt conſiderately
propoſed, in hope of ſatisfaction or ſolution. And
in this queſtion there are two things to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the ſubſtance of it, and the circumſtances. The
ſubſtance or the matter of it doth concern the tares,
what kind of grain they were, who ſowed them, and
from whence they came. Theſe have been touched
upon before, in our Diſcourſes upon the 25. verſe,
upon the <hi>Sevit,</hi> and ſhall be yet more throughly
canvaſſed in the following Anſwer, when we are
come to the <hi>ſive fecit inimicus.</hi> But for the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the queſtion, who asked it, and of whom
they asked it, thoſe come in fitly here to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.
And firſt, the men that asked it were the
ſervants of the Heavenly Husbandman, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſowen no other ſeeds then the ſeeds of piety
and true Religion, could not but wonder at the tares.
Next, being full of doubt and wonder, they made
repair for reſolution to their Lord and Maſter, whoſe
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and fellow-Labourers they were. They
knew not of the Enemy, nor his ſubtile practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and therefore took the ſpeedieſt courſe that
could be for the removing of their doubts; and put
the queſtion unto him who knew how to ſalve it.
Not one amongſt them but he might have ſaid, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus
ſum, non Oedipus.</hi> We have more need to be
reſolved of you, and come you to us?</p>
            <p>The ſtating of this point might make the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of our <hi>Romiſh</hi> Adverſaries the more inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
We challenge them of ſeveral errors and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> we tell them what
they are, how many, wherein they differ from Gods
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:168623:74"/>
word, and from the tendries of the Church in the
pureſt Ages. They make reply unto us with an <hi>unde
haec,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellar.</hi> l. 4. c. 5.</note> 
               <hi>quo tempore, quo loco, quo autore?</hi> Shew us, ſay they,
when, and by whom, and where your ſaid tares were
ſowen, or elſe they ſhall not paſſe for tares. We have
replyed to all theſe Queries in a former Sermon; not
on conſtraint, as forced unto it by the equity of the
demand, but <hi>gratis,</hi> to demonſtrate the abſurdities
and the follies of it. But now we anſwer more reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly,
that this is not to make, but miſtake the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
to change at once both ſcene and Actors.
The ſervants of the Houſholder askt the queſtion
here; there they that askt it are the ſervants of the
very enemy. He who is asked the queſtion here is
the heavenly Husbandman, whoſe eyes are alwayes
open for his Churches ſafety, and who beheld the
enemy through all his vizards, even whileſt he was
about this deed of darkneſs. By them a queſtion is
demanded of poor ignorant ſervants, who either
weary of their labour, or inclined to eaſe, or careleſs
of their Maſters buſineſs, had been faſt aſleep, and
knew not what was done till they were well waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
If they muſt needs be further ſatisfied in theſe
curious cavills, let them repair to their own Maſter,
and enquire of him, who being conſcious to himſelf
of his own lewd acts, can give them a more punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
anſwer. We are no ſervants of the enemy, nor
ever were imployed in ſins dark deſigns, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unacquainted with his plots and counſels. To us,
according to this Parable, the asking of the queſtion
appertains, not to the anſwer of it.</p>
            <p>But put the caſe the worſt that may be, and let it
paſſe for granted, that our adverſaries may pervert
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:168623:74"/>
and change the queſtion as they liſt themſelves; yet
why ſhould we return them any other Anſwer then
the Lord made unto his ſervants? Why may not we
make this reply to all their Queries, <hi>inimicus homo
hoc fecit,</hi> that the enemy did it? The Lord out of his
infinite wiſdom thought it not improper to give a
general anſwer to a particular demand. And why
ſhould we be wiſer then our Maſter? The ſervants
ask in ſpecial, <hi>unde haec zizania?</hi> the Lord returns in
generall, <hi>inimicus fecit.</hi> But as for the particulars of
time, place and perſons, wherewith our Adverſaries
preſſe and charge us againſt right and reaſon, thoſe he
reſerves unto himſelf, and conceales from us. And
'tis a learned ignorance not to know thoſe things
which God endeavours to keep ſecret. <hi>Ea neſcire quae
magiſter optimus non vult docere, erudita eſt inſcitia,</hi> as
mine Authour hath it. Some things the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
to the day of judgement, when all hearts ſhall
be open, all deſires made known, and no ſecrets hid:
And then we ſhall be ſure to know, what times the
enemy made choyce of to ſowe his tares; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
he uſed in the doing of it; what place or
Country he ſelected for their firſt appearance; with
all the other curious circumſtances which are ſo
much inſiſted on by the common Adverſary. If this
ſuffice not, we muſt finally return that Anſwer
which once <hi>Arnobius</hi> made to ſome fooliſh queſtions

the points having bin treated of before in our former

I muſt give you notice, that it relates not to the

to the Text it ſelf; in which it is ſuppoſed as
granted, that there was good feed ſowen by the
Heavenly Husbandman, however afterwards the
field became full of tares. According unto which
Propoſall, I ſhall firſt ſhew you in the Theſis, what
ſpeciall care was taken in our Reformation, that all
things might be fitted to the word of God, and the
beſt ages of the Church. Next, I ſhall make a true
diſcovery of thoſe ſeveral tares wherewith this
Field is over-grown, and Gods ſeed indangered. So

do ariſe about the ſenſe and meaning of ſome Law or

no leſſe profitable in Divinity, then it is in Law. The
State Eccleſiaſtical hath her doubts and changes, as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:168623:75"/>
great and frequent as the civill: the body myſtical
as ſubject to corruptions as the body politick. In
which condition, either of diſtractions or of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
no better way to ſet her right, to bring her to
her perfect conſtitution, then to look back upon her
primitive and ancient principles. <hi>Ad legem &amp; teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>

been her rule and Canon in ſuch deſperate

            </p>
            <p>For in that great buſineſs of the Reformation, thoſe
Worthies here, whom God had raiſed and fitted for
the undertaking, were not poſſeſſed, for ought we
finde, with any ſpirit of contradiction, or humour of
affecting contrarieties. That which they found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
eſtabliſhed, which either was agreeable to the

of the primitive Church, in point of order and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:168623:76"/>
they retained as formerly: ſo farre endeavouring
a conformity with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that where
ſhe left not Chriſt and the Primitive Church, there
they left not her. <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> however ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
and admired in the World abroad, were here
no otherwiſe conſidered then as learned men, whoſe
works and writings poſſibly might be counted uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but not thought Authentick. Our Prelates
here that were engaged in this great buſineſs, <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and <hi>Ridley,</hi> and the reſt of theſe brave <hi>Heroes,</hi>
were of as able parts as they, but more moderate
ſpirits. They knew the Church had firſt been foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Prophets and Apoſtles, our Saviour
Chriſt being the Corner-ſtone; and therefore would
not build their reformation on the names of men.
<hi>Chriſtianus mihi nomen eſt, Catholicus cognomen,</hi> was
<hi>Pacianus</hi>'s Speech of old;<note place="margin">Pacian.</note> but they made it theirs,
and ſtill we keep it as our own. But what need more?
The fair ſucceſſion of the Biſhops, and the vocation
of the Miniſtry, according to the ancient Canons;
the dignity of the Clergy in ſome ſort preſerved; the
honour and ſolemnity of Gods publick worſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored

manifeſtly that they kept themſelves to that ſacred

            <p>Two things there are eſpecially conſiderable in
the Church of Chriſt; matters of Doctrine, and of
worſhip. The firſt of theſe we find comprized in

in the points of Doctrine: ſo neither did it
<hi>Calvinize</hi> in matter of exterior order, and Gods
publick Worſhip. The Liturgy of this Church was
ſo framed and fitted, out of thoſe common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Religion, wherein all parties did agree, that
it was generally applauded and approved by thoſe,
who ſince have laboured to oppoſe it. <hi>Alexander A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſius</hi>

and that, as he himſelf affirms, both for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

<hi>Scots</hi> in their firſt Reformation divers years together
uſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy: the fancy of extemporary
prayers not being then took up not cheriſhed, as
<hi>Knox</hi> himſelf confeſſeth in his own dear Hiſtory.
And howſoever now of late they have divulged a
factious and prohibited Pamphlet againſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Popiſh Ceremonies, as they pleaſe to call them;
yet in the ſtructure of their Reformation, they bound

            <p>Thus have we ſeen a Church reformed, according
to the preſcript of the Word of God, by the Law
and Teſtimony. A Church that ſeemes to have
been cultivated by the Lords own hand, planted by
<hi>Paul,</hi> and watred by <hi>Apollos,</hi> God himſelf giving the
increaſe. A Church that grew up in the middle of
two contrary factions, as did the Primitive Church
between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and was the better ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
and conſolidated by the oppoſition. Gods
Field was no where better husbanded, the good
ſeed no where ſowen with a clearer hand, then it was
in this. <hi>O faciles dare ſumma Deos!</hi> But as it fared
at firſt with the Primitive Church,<note place="margin">Lucan:</note> ſo it hapned here.
We muſt not ſo far flatter and abuſe our ſelves, as
to conceive there are no tares at all in our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becauſe it was firſt ſowen with the Lords good
Seed. The Devil as he ſtayed his time, <hi>donec dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirent

uſe of ſuch a grain, and uſed ſuch ſubtile inſtruments
to effect his purpoſe, that many will not think them
to be tares of the enemies ſowing now they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake.
But being they are come at leſt to <hi>feciſſent

but that this tare hath taken a deep root a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us. The Biſhop is not only in theſe dayes
put below the Prieſt, but thought to be at all no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the Church of God. <hi>Aerius</hi> was too gentle
to aſcribe them any thing; nor was he ſo well ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
in the controverſie as we have been ſince. And
here methinks we may reſume, as well the wonder
as the words of <hi>Lyrinenſis:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cont. haer: cap. 9.</note> Here we have <hi>miram re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

is finely brought about; It is the Biſhop in our times,
and not the Heretick, that is turned out of Houſe
and home, pronounced to be an <hi>Alien</hi> to the Tribes
of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and curſed are they that give them room
or entertainment. It was ſo ordered in <hi>Geneva,</hi> when
in their Reformation, if I ſo may call it, they expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
their Biſhop: and they that ſince that time have
imbraced their principles, have ever ſince purſued
their practiſes. Nor is this Doctrine thus diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
a deviation only from Antiquity, no hereticall
Tenet; or made to be an Hereſie by the Biſhops
only, <hi>ab epiſcopis,</hi> as <hi>Danaeus</hi> hath it, ſuch as were
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> and St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who do ſo define it: The
learned <hi>Cracanthorp,</hi>
               <note place="margin">cap. 41. num. 3.</note> who if he did decline in any

            </p>
            <p>But yet <hi>Aerius</hi> ſtayed not here. He had before
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:168623:79"/>
blown down the Biſhops, as he thought himſelf, and
muſt now have a blow at the civil State. He could
by no meanes like of faſting, eſpecially of faſting
on ſet dayes and times; but would by all meanes have
it left to mens Chriſtian liberty, to be omitted or
performed as men liſt themſelves. <hi>Non celebranda

in thoſe moſt bleſſed times did uſe to ſpend the
week which preceded <hi>Easter,</hi> the holy week, as
pure antiquity did call it, in watching, faſting, prayer,
and other exerciſes of humiliation; on no day more
then on good <hi>Fryday. Aerius</hi> on the contrary and his

that carefully and religiouſly obſerved the ſame,

Certain I am, that many a pious man amongſt

a root this dangerous tare hath gotten in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
for he knowes not any thing who knowes

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:168623:81"/>
and Profeſſors; that they beſtow no better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
on ſuch as are conformable to the publick
Government, both in their Pamphlets and their
prattles, then ſuch as are not fit for the eares of
Chriſtians; that out of an opinion of their own dear
ſanctity, they will have no commerce, and much
leſſe humanity, with ſuch as they conceive not to like
their courſes. Theſe things are <hi>notiora quàm ut ſtylo

my buſineſs. All I ſhall ſay is briefly this, that men
are principally led into theſe extremities, on this
miſperſwaſion, that Kings have no Authority in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

ſort ſoever, in matters which concern Religion
may be a King unto himſelf. Which if it once be

<hi>quid imperatori cum Eccleſia?</hi> aſſuredly in little,

what right have Kings to Lord it over Gods Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</p>

<hi>Bardeſanes,</hi> who aſcribed all things unto <hi>Fate;</hi> by

            <p>For Popery, that is grown amongſt us to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
height; and in the points and parts thereof, in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:168623:82"/>
which the life and eſſence of Popedom doth conſiſt
eſpecially. The time was, when as Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
had the ſole power of calling Councils, of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
or preſiding in them by themſelves or Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and finally, of confirming their Acts and Canons.
This power the Popes have long uſurped, and think
it a great favour unto ſecular Princes, if they vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to give them notice of their purpoſes, or truſt
them with the execution of their Lawes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
The time was too when Princes thought
themſelves ſupreme in their own Dominions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable
to none but God. But now the Popes
have challenged a diſpoſing power, both of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Eſtates: as being the Vice-gerents of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, the Vicars general of Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
To produce Authors for the proof of ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
truths, eſpecially in ſuch a knowing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
audience, were a foul impertinency, and
indeed <hi>ſenſibile ſuper ſenſorium ponere,</hi> to light a
Candle to the Sun.</p>
            <p>In theſe two points, which are the very life and
eſſence of the Popedom, as before I ſaid, the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
is no leſſe Popiſh then the Pope himſelf. The
power of calling the Aſſembly, that appertains no
longer unto Kings and Princes; it belongs only to
the Church, that is, themſelves. God was miſtaken
ſure when he ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 10. 1, 2.</note>

that he ſhould make to, or for, himſelf two
ſilver Trumpets; tis well if <hi>Dathan, Corah</hi> and

to command that one, according to the Doctrine
now, it is originally in the people too, and in the

There is much talk indeed of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and all his

this Doctrine, <hi>per me Reges regnant,</hi> by me

               <hi>Buchanan</hi> was a learned man too, but ſpeaks

it to <hi>Geneva;</hi> The Kings and Princes of the Earth
muſt change their ſtyles and tenures, if this Doctrine

This is indeed the Doctrine proper to the Sect,

for which they have no precedent nor pattern in the

            <p>I could now to theſe points of Popery add a
point of Judaiſme, in the impoſing of a Sabbath on
the Church of Chriſt; and that to be obſerved with
ſo great ſeverity, that they have gone beyond the
Jewes, and ſhewed themſelves more Phariſaical then
the very Phariſees. But hereof I have ſpoken more
at large elſewhere, and cannot now contract it in a

thoſe Phariſees, both for their Doctrine and their
practiſe: their Doctrine, in maintaining Fate and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny

he ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Haec omnia tibi dabo,</hi> all theſe will

Princes of the World, even the <hi>Mahometan</hi> and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
hold their Crowns of God, though they do
ſervice for them to the Devil. The enemy is ſo far
from being Lord in chief of all the Univerſe, that he
hath no propriety in the ſmalleſt part: No Field, no
not the corner of a Field, which he can challenge to

own, go plough, and fallow, and manure it, and
then ſowe my ſeed. If he be ſo inclined at any time
as to be ſowing of his tares, it muſt be done in <hi>agro
Domini,</hi> ſome part or other of the Lords Field. And
then he comes but on the <hi>post fact</hi> neither, after
the Field was ſowen with good ſeed before. For
howſoever Hereſies may be <hi>antiqua,</hi> yet they are

in my Text: and what did he? <hi>Et ait illis;</hi>
He ſaid unto them. And it was no ſmall grace to his
poor ſervants that he vouchſafed to look ſo low as
to hold conference with them, and admit of parlies
in matters which himſelf alone knew how to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:168623:87"/>
But being it was a matter which concerned his
Church, and in the which the ſervants did addreſs
themſelves unto him with ſo great affection, he
thought it no diſparagement to hearken to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and return an anſwer. Nor ſtops he here,
as if he had done too much for them; but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them alſo to propoſe their counſels, <hi>vis imus &amp;
colligimus ea?</hi> in the words next following: and to
that alſo he replies: Such conferences between the
heavenly Husbandman and his Houſhold-ſervants,
God and the Prophets, Chriſt and his Diſciples, are
no rare matters in the Scripture. Not that God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtood in need of their intelligence, or was made
wiſer by their counſels; but leaving thereby an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
unto Kings and Princes, and ſuch as are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from and under them, not to deſpiſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
or undervalue the advice, of the meaneſt
perſon, how much ſoever ranked below them both
in place and power. Such men as are inquiſitive in
asking queſtions, or prompt in giving their adviſe in
emergent difficulties, however they may ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable,
yet if they do it on good grounds, as the
ſervants here, are not to be rejected as unſerviceable.
Certain I am my Houſholder conceived it ſo; He
neither blames his ſervants for their curioſity, with
<hi>nolo nimiùm curioſos;</hi> nor taxeth them of indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the delivering of their opinions, with <hi>nolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimiùm
diligentes.</hi> For howſoever to their counſel
he returns a <hi>non,</hi> yet he acquaints them fully with
thoſe weighty reaſons which did incline him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
And as unto the <hi>unde,</hi> to the point propoſed,

<hi>et ero ſimilis Altiſsimo,</hi> ſaid the proud Aſpirer; He
muſt be equall to the Almighty, both in place and

This is the enemy which I am to ſpeak of, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
that took ſuch pains to deſtroy Gods Harveſt.
We met with him before in the 25. but there we
found him with his clogge. There he is ſtyled
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>inimicus ejus,</hi> his enemy; the enemy
of God alone, and there we did conſider him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
To God an enemy <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> on the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

               </gap>rel, upon the ſentence paſſed againſt him for
his firſt aſpirings. To man an enemy no further then
he weares Gods Livery, and retains unto him: and
therefore in that place, <hi>inimicus ejus,</hi> Gods enemy.
But here we finde him more at large, an enemy; or
<hi>inimicus quiſpiam,</hi> ſome enemy, as <hi>Beza</hi> reads it. An
enemy to God, and to Man, Gods Image, and the
Church, Gods Spouſe: to each of theſe an enemy in
their ſeveral places. In the firſt, to God; to God
indeed an enemy, but an harmleſs enemy. His ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
unto God doth conſiſt much more in a continual
purpoſe to reſiſt his will, then a power to hurt him:
<hi>non poteſtate laedendi,</hi>

               <hi>ſed voluntate reſiſtendi,</hi> as the
Father hath it. The miſchiefs which he meanes to
God, are but like Arrowes ſhot againſt a Rock of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant,
which rebound back on him that ſhot them,
<hi>nihil illi valentes nocere, ſed ſibi.</hi> The hurt he
doth is to himſelf, in filling up the meaſure of his
own iniquities, and thereby adding to the weight of
his juſt damnation.</p>
            <p>Things not ſucceeding to his wiſh with Almighty
God, his next deſign is upon man. With him he had
a quarrel too at his firſt Creation: It grieved him at
the very heart to ſee poor man, compoſed of ſuch
vile matter as duſt and aſhes, adopted unto thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall
glories,<note place="margin">Gen. 3:</note> whence himſelf was fallen: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:168623:89"/>
he reſolves to work him to the like Apoſtaſie.
This onſet he then gave, and hath ſince continued,
endeavouring nothing more then the fall of man,
that he might triumph on his ruines. For being alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from the love of God, he hath been labouring
ever ſince the World began to fill mens mindes
with falſe opinions touching God, and to bring in
ſtrange forms of worſhip, which the Lord abhors.

               </note> If <hi>Job,</hi> or any pious and religious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

God himſelf; that getting him into his hands,
to ſpoyl and plague him to the utmoſt, he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
him in the end to curſe God and die. So then
we ſee the difference of the Devils enmity unto God
and man. To God he is an enemy <hi>affectu</hi> only, in
his minde and purpoſe; to man an enemy <hi>affectu</hi> and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:168623:89"/>
               <hi>effectu</hi> too; not only ſeeking whom he may devoure,
but devouring many.</p>
            <p>Thus deales he alſo with the Church, with the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
body of Gods choſen ſervants. Chriſt had no
ſooner raiſed himſelf from the bonds of death, and
placed himſelf at the right hand of God in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
places,<note place="margin">Apocal. c. 12. 1: <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> but preſently the Woman, the Church
of God, however cloathed with the Sunne, and
crowned with Starres, was by the Great Dragon
brought into diſtreſs, and forced to flie into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.
Nor was it long before there was a Warre
in Heaven, <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

had the better then, and that the Dragon was caſt
out and vanquiſhed, to the great comfort of the
Saints, yet hath he never left to perſecute and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
the Church. The caſe ſtands ſo between the
Devil and the Church of God, as it was once 'twixt
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage.</hi>

hath it. Either they were in open Warre, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for it; or if at any time in peace, it was a
peace more dangerous then the Warre it ſelf. For
in the infancy of the Church, what perſecutions did
he raiſe againſt her? what monſtrous Hereſies did
he raiſe within her? what havock did he make of the
Saints of God? what a red Sea did he create of the
blood of Martyrs? If that at any time his wretched
Inſtruments grew weary of their own tyranny, as
ſometimes they did, he then prepares the way unto
new afflictions, by charging thoſe poor innocent
ſouls with inceſtuous mixtures, and drinking the
warm blood of a new ſlain Infant: which were

when the Church was ſetled in a perfect peace by

a peace but ill obſerved by the treacherous enemie,
intent on all occaſions, watching all advantages, if
not to cut it down at once by open violence, yet to

            <p>This to perform, he was to deal in other manner,
and by other inſtruments then before he did; more
like a cunning practiſer then an open enemy. Before
we finde him ſtyled <hi>inimicus</hi> ſimply, or <hi>inimicus quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piam,</hi>
as <hi>Beza</hi> here. But in this place he comes in with

               </gap>, as in the <hi>Greek,</hi>

agree <hi>Caſtellio</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> in their tranſlations of

not to be God, but like him. It was not <hi>ero

to ſhew that correſpondence and affinity which
is between the Devil and the wicked man: the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
in this place being called a man, and <hi>Judas</hi> in
the ſixth of <hi>John</hi> being called a Devil; but theſe,
as I conceive it, are but tricks of fancy, and come not
home unto the point.</p>
            <p>For my part, I ſhould rather think that Satan is
here called <hi>inimicus homo,</hi> becauſe in ſowing of his
tares he uſed the help of envious and malicious men,
whom he had fitted for that purpoſe. When he
firſt ſet upon the Church by violent and bloody
perſecutions, he made uſe of Beaſts. The Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants

uſe of Serpents, that by the poyſon of their impious
Doctrine, ſhe might be brought unto deſtruction.
Certain I am that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reſembleth every
ſeverall Hereticks unto ſome ſpeciall ſort of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.<note place="margin">Epiphan.</note>
But in the ſowing of theſe tares, in bringing
in that deviation from the true Religion which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:168623:91"/>
in this Parable; he then thought it his beſt
way to make uſe of men, men who knew how to

all occaſions; and ſo with more aſſurance might ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

never went beyond himſelf but in this invention, in
putting on the ſhape of man when he did this feat,
that he might paſſe unſeen by the houſhold-ſervants.
This is the true cauſe as I conceive it, why Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
is here called <hi>inimicus homo,</hi> the envious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
man; or if you will, the enemy-man, as the
<hi>Rhemiſts</hi> read it. What kinde of men the enemy
made uſe of to effect his purpoſe, and how he makes

               <note place="margin">Horar: de arte.</note> He that
deſires to be eſteemed a Maſter in the Art of man,
muſt be well skilled in all the humors and affections,
which are peculiar to his nature, and incident unto

and weakneſſes, their imperfections and defects:
which if applied with cunning, and employed with
care, may prove exceeding ſerviceable to the aims
and projects of the cunning practiſer. And as the
thrifty man that deſires to proſper, turns every thing
unto his profit, and makes no ſmall commodity
out of toyes and trifles; ſo he that trades in men, and
hath the art of diving into their affections, may huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and improve the meaneſt paſſion to his great
advantage. The Devil, the old enemy, is a cunning
man, a ſubtle practiſer, and is not now to learn
this leſſon. When he was once reſolved on the <hi>fecit

hoc,</hi> to ſowe his tares, his dangerous and hereticall
Doctrines in the Church of God, he was not to be
taught how to deal with men, how to make uſe of
their affections, of their luſts and paſſions, for the
promoting of his purpoſe; or how to uſe their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and deficiencies, as an help unto it. Whether
men be voluptuous, arrogant, or vain-glorious, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they pine with envy, or are ſtirred with choler;
or be they raſh, or head-ſtrong, tis all one to him.
He knowes full well his opportunities, how to apply
himſelf unto them, as the humour takes: and by
their meanes to do that buſineſſe, which he durſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Not that the Devil hath a
power, as the Father notes it, to thruſt men into his
employments whether they will or not; but that
he makes ſuch uſe of their luſts and paſſions as may

As for example;</p>
            <p>The Church was uſed, according to the rigor of
the primitive times, to enjoyne ſtrict and tedious
penance on the party criminall: why might not this
be turned to money? Hence came the preaching,
and the prizing too, of Indulgences and the year of
<hi>Jubile;</hi> no ſmall Revenue of the Popedom. Chriſt
had left power unto his Miniſters to abſolve the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
and to remit the ſins of a contrite perſon:
may not ſome gain be made of that? may not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
be obtained for money, as a thing of courſe? yes

               <hi>non pro praeteritis tantùm, ſed &amp; pro futuris;</hi>
not for ſins paſt only, but for thoſe to come: the gates
of Heaven are never opened with more ſpeed to the
formall penitent, then by ſilver keyes. Some of
the Fathers ſpeak of a fire of Purgatory, though
doubtingly, and as a matter not agreed on: might
not that fire be made to warm their Kitchins, and
prepare all them in a readineſs for the common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectory?
The Paſſion of our Lord and Saviour was
a ſufficient ſacrifice both for quick and dead: Might
not the Maſſe, or the commemoration of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:168623:94"/>
be taught to be of equall value? And having
taught the people ſo, might they not ſell their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
at a dearer rate then the falſe traytor ſold his
Maſter, whom the Maſſe commemorates? The times
began to be exceedingly inclined to ſuperſtition:
Wer't not an excellent piece of cunning to feed that
humour, and put the people to the charge of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment?
From hence came ſhrines, and vowes
to Saints, and Pilgrimages; and, which was worſt of
all, falſe and feigned miracles, only to gain greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to their ſhrines and temples, and the more
profit to themſelves. I could hunt further on this

What fitter time then this, to captivate mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
to the Churches dictates, and to advance
their own traditions into the Chair and Throne of
the Word of God, when men were taught, to the
great obloquy and contempt of learning, that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was the mother of devotion? And in a word,
what fitter time then this, to open and bring forth
the tares of Image-worſhip, and invocation of the

them to attend their duties, or in default thereof did
not proceed againſt them, as he ſhould have done,
according to the ancient Diſcipline. But more to
blame no doubt was the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Syn. Trid. Seſſ. 22. Can. 8.</note> who on

of late. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who lived about 300
years ago, no more, hath delivered plainly, <hi>calicem in

not then adminiſtred unto the people in ſome certain

            <p>Now, as the Prophet once complained, as was the
People then, ſuch was the Prieſt; and as the Prieſt was
then, ſuch were the People; both ignorant alike, and
both alike negligent: The negligence incumbent on
the Prieſts was of two ſorts alſo; firſt, in not teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the People as they ought to do; and 2dly, in
not applying ſpeedy and peculiar remedies to emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
miſchiefs. The Prieſts lips, by the Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
were to preſerve knowledge, and at their

they fed the People with dumb ſhewes and Images,

Gentiles. By meanes whereof the rites and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of the Church were grown ſo numerous,
that they became a burden to the Church of God;
and being firſt ordained as helps and acceſſories to
Gods publick worſhip, came in the end to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the meritorious and eſſential parts thereof:
and having in their Inſtitution firſt no more then
<hi>uſum ſignificandi,</hi> a power to ſignifie, attained at

of the works and effects of Grace.</p>
            <p>As for the fault in not applying ſpeedy remedies
to emergent miſchiefs, that relates chiefly to the
Prelates, as thoſe who are intruſted by our Saviour
with the powers of Government. For if at firſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the broching of ſome new opinions which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to tend to any alteration in the things of God,
the Prelates had beſtirred themſelves, tryed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
it by the holy Scriptures, or by the tendries
and expreſſions of the Primitive Church, we had not
now been troubled to decry thoſe Doctrines which
are obtruded on the Church for Catholick: Or if
they had compelled the People to obſerve thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
which had been recommended to them
from moſt pure Antiquity, and not have ſuffered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be thruſt upon them, either by practiſe or
connivence we had not been troubled to diſcard
thoſe uſages, which had defiled, if not prophaned
the whole Worſhip of God. So when the Latine
Tongue in theſe Weſtern parts, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture
of <hi>Gohes, Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Vandalls,</hi> and other
Nations of the North, began to alter and degenerate
from its ancient purity, if then the Prelates of the
Church had alſo changed the Language of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:168623:97"/>
Liturgy, and fitted it to the underſtanding of the
common people, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had never
been accuſed of ſo foul a crime, as to inforce poor
people to a Latine Service, to which they cannot ſay
Amen.</p>
            <p>For ſure it is an excellent rule of him in <hi>Gellius,</hi>

the advancing of the Popes ſupremacy; what of St.
<hi>Briget</hi> and St. <hi>Clare,</hi> (if I may ſo call them) in laying
the burden of profeſſed virginity upon the necks of

as knowing what fit Inſtruments they are to advance
a party. Not that he doth employ them often in the
ſetting, but in the ſelling of his tares; their buſineſs
lies not in the Field, but in the Market, to paſſe them
up and down, and from hand to hand, and raiſe the
price of the Commodity. St. <hi>Paul</hi> foretells us of a

            <p>Thus have I repreſented to you a diſcovery of the

paſſions and deficiencies of his ſeverall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
to bring about the <hi>fecit hoc</hi> which my
Text here ſpeaks of. And though it be a matter of
no ſmall difficulty to trace the Prince of darkneſs in
his deeds of darkneſs, yet I have done the beſt I
could, directed by the light of Scripture, and by the
Candle of antiquity, to obſerve his goings. The uſe
we make of all is this, that we avoid thoſe humors
and deficiencies in our ſeverall ſtations which Satan
is ſo apt to work on; that we be neither puffed up
with ambition, nor tickled with vain-glory, nor filled
with covetous deſires, nor pined with diſcontent
and envy, nor dulled with ignorance, nor finally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted
with a lazie negligence. Theſe paſſions and
defects if we yield not to, we need not fear the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

It is affirmed by the Hiſtorian of
<hi>Caius Caeſar,</hi> how he behaved
himſelf in ſuch different manner,
that there wanted not forcible
reaſons to condemn, yet excuſe ſufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him. The like may we affirm of our Servants
here; he that doth look upon them in their ſleep and
negligence, and findes them <hi>ut dormirent homines,</hi>
cannot but think them acceſſary to ſo great a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
as Satan brought upon the Church in ſowing
Tares. The opportunity they gave him by their dull
ſecurity, or at the leaſt their ſupine careleſneſs,
makes them parcel-guilty. And he that undertakes
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:168623:99"/>
to defend them in it, will queſtionleſs as much betray
his Client, as they their Cauſe. But look upon them
when they were awakened, when they had ſeen their
own error, and the Churches danger, and then how
many things are there worthy at once of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
and imitation? <hi>In ſervis habemus tam quod
laudemus quàm quod imitemur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gorran: in locum.</note> as my Author hath
it. Firſt, their fidelity, <hi>quòd acceſſerunt,</hi> in that they
came unto their Maſter,<note place="margin">v. 27.</note> made him acquainted with
the accident, and ſo prepared him for the Remedy.
Their coming was an Argument of their good
intentions, and that they had not willingly betrayed
the truſt repoſed in them; they did not fly on the
diſcovery. And next we have their care, <hi>quòd quaeſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi>
that they could never be at quiet till they were
ſatisfied in the Original and Inſtrument of ſo great a
miſchief, till they had learnt the <hi>unde,</hi> whence the
tares ſhould come. And when their Maſter had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
them in the <hi>fecit hoc,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 28.</note> and told them that the
Enemy had done it, yet they ſtayed not here, as if
the queſtion had been made out of curioſity, more to
inform their underſtandings, then reform the matter.
They thought it did concern them to redeem the
time, becauſe their former fact was evill. And as the
enemy had entred by their ſloth and negligence, and
thereby took occaſion to deſtroy Gods Harveſt; ſo
they conceived it did belong to them eſpecially to
labour in the Reformation, and to reduce Gods
Field to its primitive luſtre by their zeal and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
This was the thing moſt aimed at in the <hi>Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerunt,</hi>
this the chief reaſon of their coming. No
ſooner had they heard that the enemy did it,<note place="margin">Lyran. in locum.</note> and
that this enemy was the Devil, (<hi>Diaboli calliditate
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:168623:100"/>
factum eſſe,</hi> as it is in <hi>Lyra;</hi>) but preſently they make
an offer of their ſervice to redreſs the miſchief, and
by their joynt endeavours to root out thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ares by
which Gods Field was ſo indangered. The ſervants
ſaid unto him, <hi>Vis imus &amp; colligimus ea, Wilt thou
that we go and gather them up?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the laſt part which the Servants have to act
in this preſent Dialogue; and in this part they give
a fair expreſſion of their zeal and wiſdom. He that
will take their Picture right, ſhall finde that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
of theſe five Lineaments: For firſt, we have
a noble courage, <hi>vis imus?</hi> Sir, <hi>Wilt thou that we go
and give the onſet?</hi> Tis not the Devil whom we fear,
nor any of his wretched Inſtruments, how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may be, both in power and malice. <hi>Vis
imus?</hi> Say but the word only, and thy ſervants go.
And next, we finde an honeſt zeal to rectifie what
was amiſſe in the Field of God. <hi>Vis imus &amp; colligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
ea?</hi> Is it your pleaſure that thoſe Tares ſhall be
rooted up? Tis not the Tares we are in love with,
how fair ſoever to the eye, how plauſible ſoever they
may ſeem in the opinion and eſteem of ſeduced
people. Say thou but <hi>faciat is hoc,</hi> and thy ſervants
will do it. In each we have their readineſs and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
Firſt, <hi>imus &amp; colligimus,</hi> we go and gather, in
the plural number; then <hi>imus &amp; colligimus,</hi> we go
and gather, in the preſent tenſe; and laſt of all, we
have their temper and obedience, guiding their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
by their Maſters will, and governing their zeal
by his direction, <hi>Vis imus &amp; colligimus ea?</hi> This we
are ready to perform, if you pleaſe to have it ſo; if
otherwiſe, we neither are ſo in love with danger, nor
ſo ambitious of imployment, as not to take your
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:168623:100"/>
Warrant and Commiſſion with us for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therefore <hi>fiat voluntas tua,</hi> not our will,
but thy will be done; <hi>Vis imus &amp; colligimus ea?</hi> Wilt
thou that we go and gather them up? Theſe are the
features which I am to draw, though I confeſs with
an ignorant and unskilful pencil; leaving them to
be better limmed and poliſhed by your more ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
meditations. And firſt I am to lay before you
their heroick courage; <hi>vis imus?</hi> wilt thou that
we go?</p>

is little worth when it comes alone, when it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
joyned nor ſeconded with vertuous purpoſes.
Some deſire knowledge only that they may be
known, and this is vanity: ſome only for the thing it
ſelf, to know, and this is curioſity: others, that they
may edifie therewith, and this is charity. This laſt
kinde was the deſire of knowledge which theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
brought, when they repaired unto their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
with an <hi>unde haec?</hi> They only laboured to diſcern
whence the Tares ſhould come, that ſo they might
bethink themſelves of ſome preſent Remedy. And
having found out what they ſought for, a man would
eaſily have thought they had found enough to ſave
them any further trouble: To tell them that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
was abroad, and that by his falſe Arts and
Practiſes he had ſowen thoſe Tares, might well have
been a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to all further care; for who would
willingly provoke an enemy, eſpecially in matters
which concern the publick, when by declining of
the buſineſs, &amp; quitting an employment of ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
nature, he may preſerve himſelf both in peace
and quietneſs? But when this Enemy is diſcovered
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:168623:101"/>
further, to be an enemy of no common rank, but even
the very Prince of darkneſs, <hi>qui tot Legionibus impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritat,</hi>
one that commands ſo many Legions; I trow
it were no part of wiſdom to incur his anger, when by
a plauſible and diſcreet connivence we may hold
fair with him.</p>
            <p>To go againſt an enemy of ſuch power and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were a deſperate madneſs, ſuch as no man of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
brains would be guilty of, when he may ſafely
ſit at home, and take ſuch fortune as the ſucceſs and
iſſue of affaires ſhould offer: yet ſuch was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
courage of the ſervants here, that none of all
theſe cautions or conſiderations could preponderate
with them, or hinder them from venturing in
their Maſters cauſe; <hi>vis imus? Wilt thou that we
go?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'twas no mean note of a noble courage that
they would be going: It ſeemes they thought it not
becomming to ſit ſtill at home, and ſpend their time
in conſultations, how, and by what cloſe meanes,
without the open hazard of their lives and fortunes,
ſo great a buſineſs as that was might be beſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
The miſchief which they feared was imminent,
not capable of long debates, of ſlow and lingring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations.

               <note place="margin">Martial.</note>

And whileſt they ſpent the time in Diſputes and
Queſtions, caſting of doubts, and raiſing caſuall or
emergent ſcruples, the miſchief which they feared
might have fallen upon them. 'Tis true, the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
was great, and full of danger; and therefore
was to be encountred with an equall courage, both
in the onſet and purſuit. The greater the attempt
was conceived to be, the braver reſolutions were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:168623:101"/>
in them that durſt undertake it. Poor are the
ſpirits of thoſe men who in a time of common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
when the whole Church is threatned, and the
State oppreſſed, dare not go forth to meet an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching
miſchief. To ſink under the burden of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous
fortune, and not to ſtruggle with adverſity,
is the next way to tempt and invite it to us. When
troubles are at hand go forth to meet them;<note place="margin">Ovid:</note>

            <p>But <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhall not go alone; the Church of

When <hi>Moſes</hi> was imployed by God on ſo ſowre a

Meſſage, as to ſolicit <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tyrant

And when he was reſolved upon it, what diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
did he meet with? how many times was he
repulſed with threats and terrors? yet God no oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> though he ſaid it often, <hi>Ingredere

of my Children, that mercileſs oppreſſor of my
people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and tell him that he ſhall no longer
keep them in that houſe of bondage; but <hi>Moſes</hi>
went immediatly upon the errand. It was no need
to bid him haſt, when the afflictions of his people, and
the neceſſities of that poor Church did require his
going. <hi>Moſes,</hi> though celebrated in the Scripture for
a man of meekneſs,<note place="margin">Numb. 12. 3.</note> 
               <hi>mitiſsimus ſuper omnes homines,</hi>
as the Vulgar reads it, wanted not courage to go on
when the Lord commanded. But this perhaps
ſhewed more of his obedience then his reſolution;
and <hi>Moſes</hi> did no more in this then the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
none of which ſtayed behind, or put off the
ſervice (excepting once the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi>) when
God bad them go.</p>
            <p>Let us next therefore look on the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi>
who when God wanted one to reform his Church,
and ſeemed thus to proclaim his wants, <hi>Quem mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,

               <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend? who will

made offer on his own accord to undertake it, <hi>Ecce
ego! mitte me;</hi> Here am I, (ſaith the Prophet) let
me be ſent, and ſee if I decline the buſineſs, or dare
not put my ſelf on the undertaking. The Prophet

the Churches dangers. He ſtayed but for his

            </p>
            <p>And yet we are not come to the beſt examples
which the Church yields us in this caſe. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
though they were imployed by the Lord their
God, in matters of this thankleſs and invidious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet were they ſeldom ſent abroad beyond the
bounds and limits of their native Countrey, where
they were countenanced and backed with their
friends and kindred. It was not ſo with the Apoſtles,
their <hi>Ite</hi> was of a more large, almoſt an infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
<hi>Ite in omnes gentes, Go into all the World and
preach the Goſpel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note> And they were told before they
undertook the buſineſs, <hi>Ecce mitto vos, Behold I

               <note place="margin">Id. cap. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and needs

ye ſhall be buffeted and reviled, condemned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted.</hi>
More then ſo yet; <hi>Satanas expetivit,</hi> Satan
himſelf deſires to ſift and winnow you. And though
I give you power to caſt out Devils,<note place="margin">Luk. 22:</note> yet do not think
that Satan will ſo eaſily forgo his hold, or loſe the
Kingdom which he hath ſo long poſſeſſed in the
ſouls of men. Tis neither againſt Principalities and
Powers, nor only againſt fleſh and blood that you
are to wreſtle; but againſt the Devil and his Angels,
againſt the Rulers of the darkneſs of this preſent
world: yet finde we not that any of thoſe bleſſed
Spirits was therewith diſcouraged, or did not think
themſelves obliged the rather to fulfill their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
becauſe it ſeemed ſo full of danger. Which of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:168623:103"/>
them did not travel both Lands and Seas, when once
the <hi>Ite</hi> was pronounced? Which of them might not
well have ſaid in the Poets Language, <hi>Quae regio
in terris noſtri non plena laboris?</hi> What corner was
there of the Earth which they went not to, in which
they did not cultivate the Field of God; and in
ſo doing bid defiance to the powers of darkneſſe?</p>
            <p>We muſt not look to finde a Parallel to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
in the Ages following. And yet the ſervants
of my Text, in point of courage, came not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind;
whom neither the report of ſo great an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as had been practiſing of late in the Field of
God, could terrifie from going forth to ſecure the
Harveſt; nor the complexion of the Tares, which
was fair and ſpecious, could hinder or divert from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
their endeavours to root them out. He that
had ſeen the Fathers of the Primitive times grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with Hereticks, pleading the Churches cauſe in
their Apologeticks, refuſing to comply with thoſe
impieties which were obtruded on them by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
powers; and ſinally, in going to the Scaffold
with no leſſe a bravery then if ſome Actor had been

ſeed they came, but they were vehemently zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to root them out. They knew full well what
miſchief would enſue, if it were not looked to, both
in relation to the Field, in danger to be overgrown
and maſtered by them; and to the Children of the
Church, who when they truſted to be fed with the
bread of life, might unawares be poyſoned with
the bread of wickedneſs. In both reſpects, no courſe
more proper as they thought, than <hi>ire &amp; colligere,</hi> to
go and gather them, before they had deſtroyed the
Wheat, or by that Gods people. This they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to do, there's no doubt of that. Their <hi>imus &amp;

            <p>To which of theſe two courſes their zeal might
bend them, is in the next place to be conſidered; I
conceive the laſt. And this I am induced to think by
the Maſters Anſwer; who on the hearing of the

that they ſhould ſerve for nothing but a dumb

a gapp to all impurity both of life and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There was a time once in the Church of</hi> England,
(<hi>I do not ſay it is ſo now) wherein the cenſures of
the Church, under pretence or colour of ſome civill
ſanctions, were either quite aboliſhed, or of no effect;
to the no ſmall increaſe of vice, becauſe it nouriſhed
a preſumption of impunity in vicious perſons. Of this
old Father</hi> Latimer <hi>doth thus complain in a Sermon
preached before King</hi> Edward:<note place="margin">Serm. 2.</note> Lechery (ſaith he)
is uſed in <hi>England,</hi> and ſuch lechery as is uſed in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place of the World. And yet it is made a matter of
ſport, a matter of nothing, a laughing matter, a trifle, not
to be paſſed on nor reformed. Well, I truſt it will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
one day, and I hope to live to ſee it mended as
old as I am. And here I will make a ſuit to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
to reſtore unto the Church the Diſcipline of
Chriſt, in excommunicating ſuch as be notable offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Nor never deviſe any other way; for no man is
able to deviſe any better then that God hath done, with
excommunication to put them from the Congregation,
till they be confounded. Therefore reſtore Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
for Excommunication, and that ſhall be a meane,
both to pacifie Gods wrath and indignation; and alſo
that leſſe abomination ſhall be uſed then in times paſt
hath been, and is at this day. I ſpeak this of a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and I mean to move it of a will to your Grace, and
your Realm. Bring into the Church of <hi>England</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Diſcipline of Excommunication, that open ſinners
may be ſtricken withall. <hi>So farre the very words of
Father</hi> Latimer. <hi>Let every one conſider of them
as he thinks moſt neceſſary: perhaps the Sermon
may be more effectuall with ſome kinde of men,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:168623:106"/>
when one is raiſed up from the dead to preach unto
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, this could not be the way which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by thoſe ſervants, if either we conſider their
<hi>Colligimus,</hi> or the <hi>eradicetis</hi> of their Maſter in the
following words. The ſervants, or the Church in them
might have gone on to excommunication of the
Heretick, and the condemning of the Hereſie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt fear or imagination, that by ſo doing,
<hi>eradicetur ſimul cum eis triticum,</hi> the wheat, the Lords
good ſeed would be pulled up with them. The cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of an Heretick doth rather ſtrengthen then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the truth of Doctrine, and he that doth correct
a ſtubborn and impenitent ſinner, hindreth not, but
confirms the vertuous perſon in the way of godlineſs.
And for <hi>Colligimus,</hi> that is we know a compound
word, as is <gap reason="foreign">

it may be done ſometimes <hi>in ore gladii,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voures

theſe tares to be arraigned and tryed at the Churches

            <p>And being their meaning was not ſo, their zeal
though more remarkable, was yet leſſe warrantable.
A zeal like that of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the two Sonnes

No dealing with ſome zelots of both ſides,
but by fire and faggot, by the ſword at leaſt; for
which they have no warrant I am ſure from either
Text. Neither indeed do they which ſtand moſt on
it fetch their grounds from hence; or if they did, how
wretchedly would thoſe grounds deceive them? nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Brethren there, nor the ſervants here, had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
calling from the Lord, to be the inſtruments of
his vengeance. The Apoſtles were ordained by
Chriſt, amongſt other things, to offer unto God the
ſacrifice of prayer for the ſins of the people; but not
to ſacrifice the people for their ſins to God. No ſuch
burnt-offering to be found (Iam ſure of that) in all
the Goſpels. And 'twas the duty of theſe ſervants,
not to confound the Heretick, but to confute the
Hereſie; rather to pray for the converſion, then
practiſe the ſubverſion of the wicked man. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Chriſt rebuked the two Brethren for their fiery
zeal,<note place="margin">v. 55:</note> 
               <hi>neſcitis cujus ſpiritus eſtis, Ye know not of what
ſpirit you are.</hi> Nor fared it otherwiſe in effect with
the ſervants here, although the reaſon of their indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was more juſt and viſible. For though we do
not finde that this zeal of theirs was openly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by their Lord and Maſter; yet it was tacitly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:168623:107"/>
becauſe not ſuffered to proceed unto execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The goodneſs of our God winks at the
errors of an honeſt zeal, and doth ſo love the ſtrength
of our good affections, that it paſſeth over their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
If it tranſport us, as it doth ſometimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
our limits and due bounds, he rather pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the exiliencies of our heat and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ervency, then the
indifferences of our lukewarmneſs. How highly
would the Lord eſteem a well-governed zeal, when
as his mercy crowns it many times even with all its
faults?</p>
            <p>And yet this zeal of theirs, if conſidered rightly,
was neither faulty nor ill-governed, although miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the meanes and inſtruments which God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to make uſe of in ſo great a work as the eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of theſe tares, the finall condemnation of
them. God purpoſed to bring them to deſtruction,
but not by their hands, not by their endeavours; and
thoroughly to purge his field of a ſeed ſo dangerous,
though not ſo ſoon as they expected, not till the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
coming on of Harveſt. The error of their zeal was
but in the circumſtances, not in the ſubſtance of the
work. The work was to be done, but not by them;
and at another time, not then when they made the
offer: but this was more then God had formerly
revealed unto them. So as the worſt which can be
ſaid of this act of theirs, was, that they had a zeal to
the glory of God, but not according unto know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
I mean the knowledge of all points and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
which God did purpoſe to obſerve in ſo
great a buſineſs. Which zeal of theirs, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
may it condemn the coldneſs and ſtupidity of
this preſent Age, in which there are ſo few, if any,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:168623:108"/>
that are affected zealouſly in the cauſe of God? How
few made offer of their ſervice, when occaſion was;
I ſay not to root out, but ſuppreſs thoſe tares which
threatned then ſuch imminent dangers, and have ſince
brought ſo ſad a deſolation on this Church of Chriſt?
And now that they are come ſo fully to <hi>feciſſent fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi>
how few preſent themſelves to their Lord and
Maſter, ſaying, <hi>vis imus &amp; colligimus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pleaſure that we go and gather? <hi>Hujuſmodi ſi zelus

Author hath it. Were there more zeal amongſt the
ſervants of the Houſhold, there would not be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tares in the field of God. There's no doubt of
that; eſpecially if this zeal be armed with courage,
and both theſe ſeconded with readineſs and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in the promoting of the work, according as we
finde it in the ſervants here.</p>
            <p>For, as was formerly obſerved, they did not only
come before their Maſter with zeal and courage, but
ſhewed in both their readineſs and unanimity. Firſt,

The ſervants had done all things well ſince
they were awakened, both in their coming and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
the reſolute expreſſions of their zeal and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
their readineſs and unanimity in the promoting
of their Maſters buſineſs: There wanted nothing
now to diſpatch the work but a Commiſſion from
their Maſter. And certainly it ſtood with reaſon, that
in a buſineſs wherein their Maſter was concerned in
ſo high a manner, they ſhould do nothing raſhly
without his conſent. Had they gone otherwiſe to
work, they had not merited ſo much for their zeal
and courage, as they had forfeited and loſt for want
of wiſdom. <hi>Saepe honeſtas rerum cauſas, ni judicium

the Story, when as his hair was grown, and his eyes
put out; and ſeldom ſerves to other purpoſe then

yielded to obedience, and courage thought it no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement

made them firſt conſult their Maſter, before they

with them: the bit of reſpect being oftentimes as

guide to zeal, and only that which keeps it that it
breaks not out into open fury. If good directions do
not hold the reins, our good intentions many times
may chance to break their own neck, and the Riders
too: and which is yet moſt ſtrange of all, without
ſuch guidance and inſtruction our zeal to God may
lead us from him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the buſineſs which they came about, was
their Maſters chiefly: the field of which they were
ſo zealous, did belong to him, as the ſole owner and
Proprietary; and therefore <hi>Ager ſuus,</hi> his field, <hi>v.</hi> 24.
The enemy againſt whom they reſolved to go was
not theirs, but his; or theirs no otherwiſe then as
they did retain to him, and weare his Livery: and
therefore <hi>inimicus ejus,</hi> his enemy, <hi>v.</hi> 25. Men might
have ſaid they had bin deſperately bold, and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
zealous, if they had entred on his field, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his enemies, without his liking and conſent. It
had been little to the prayſe of their diſcretion, of

And though they had returned with ſucceſs

their affections to their Maſters judgement. They
fell not preſently on the affront to their imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor called for fire from Heaven to conſume
them utterly, as on the blaſting of the breath of
their diſpleaſure: As vehement as their zeal and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
was, yet they propoſed the buſineſs to their

that they who were in any publick place or Miniſtry

and to the guidance of ſuch perſons, who under him,

matters, before he had both Miſſion and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:168623:112"/>
too. God had firſt ſaid, <hi>Vade &amp; dices huic populo,</hi>
Go and tell this people, before he undertook the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
or put himſelf upon the work of reformation.
And which is there of all the Prophets that went up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Gods errands without his conſent, and ſtood not
more on <hi>dixit Dominus,</hi> then on <hi>dicam populo?</hi> I trow,
the times were then corrupt, and the people ſinful.
The whole contexture of their ſeveral Prophecies
make that plain enough: yet finde we none of them
ſo haſty in rebuking either, as not to take a ſpeciall
Warrant and Commiſſion from the hand of God. No
<hi>imus &amp; colligimus</hi> in the dayes of old, in point of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
miſſion and employment; but ſtill there
was a <hi>vis</hi> expreſſed, ſome warrant looked for from
the Lord, to make way unto it.</p>
            <p>So for the way of ordinary Reformation, when the
fabrick of the Church was out of order, &amp; the whole
worſhip of the Lord either defiled with ſuperſtitions,
or intermingled with Idolatries, as it was too often;
did not Gods ſervants tarry and await his leiſure, till
thoſe who were ſupreme both in place and power,
were by him prompted and inflamed to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
How many years had that whole people made
an Idol of the Brazen Serpent, and burnt incenſe to
it, before it was defaced by King <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> How
many more might it have longer ſtood undefaced,
untouched by any of the common people, had not
the King given order to demoliſh it? How many
Ages had the ſeduced <hi>Iſraelites</hi> adored before the
Altar of <hi>Bethel,</hi> before it was hewen down and cut in
pieces by the good King <hi>Joſiah?</hi> Where can we finde
that any of Gods faithful Servants, any of thoſe 7000
ſouls which had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> did
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:168623:112"/>
ever go about to deſtroy the ſame? or that <hi>Elijah</hi> or
<hi>Eliſha,</hi> two men as extraordinary for their Calling as
their zeal and courage, did excite them to it, or told
them it was lawful for them ſo to do, without the
<hi>Fiat</hi> of Authority to make good the work? Where
ſhall we read in the whole courſe and current of the
Book of God, that the common people in and by
their own authority removed the high places, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
the Images, or cut down the Groves, thoſe
excellent Inſtruments of ſuperſtition and Idolatry;
that they appointed Faſts, and ordained Feſtivals;
or that they did ſo much as attempt ſuch matters,
without this <hi>vis,</hi> the power and approbation of the
ſupreme Magiſtrate?</p>
            <p>This was the Doctrine and practiſe both of the
former times, ſo far forth as Gods Book directs us
in the ſearch thereof: nor ever was it preached or
printed till now of late that it ſhould be otherwiſe;
or that the work of Reformation belonged unto the
common people, in what capacity ſoever they were
clothed and veſted. Of late indeed I finde it to be
ſo determined, it being affirmed by <hi>Gleſſelius,</hi> one of
the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants</hi> of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> that if the
Prince and Clergy did neglect their duties in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of the Church, <hi>neceſſe eſſe tum id facere ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beios
Iſraelitas,</hi> that then it did belong to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people. And tis with a <hi>neceſſe,</hi> if you mark it
well; they might not only do it, but they muſt be
doing. Do it, but how? what? in the way of treaty,
by mediation and petition, and ſuch humble meanes
by which the dignity of the ſupreme Magiſtrate may
be kept indemnified? not ſo, but even by force and
violence, <hi>licèt ad ſanguinem uſque pro eo pugnent,</hi> even
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:168623:113"/>
to the ſhedding of their own and their Brethrens
blood. In which it is moſt ſtrange to ſee how ſoon
this deſperate Doctrine found as lewd an uſe; how
ſoon the people put in practiſe what the Preacher
taught them; but farre more ſtrange to ſee, (and who
can chuſe but ſee it, if he be not blinde?) how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
their Scholars in this Iſland, both for the theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and the practiſe, have out-gone their Maſters. And
wonder tis in all this time they made it not an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of their Chriſtian Faith, and put it not into the
place of ſome one or other of the twelve which they
think leſſe neceſſary. Here is a <hi>vis</hi> indeed, they ſay
true in that; but no ſuch <hi>vis</hi> as is intended in the
Text. The ſervants of my Parable knew no other
<hi>vis,</hi> then that of Propoſition only, it being not their
intent nor cuſtom, either to run before or againſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
And having made the Propoſition, they
did with patience and humility attend the Anſwer of
their Maſter, which they were faithfully reſolved to
conform unto, however it might croſſe their own
dear deſignes; but what that anſwer was you may
ſee hereafter. For though the Maſter took no time
to conſider of it, who comprehendeth all things in
one generall view; yet being it is a buſineſs of ſuch
weight and moment, and that your patience hath
been tired too much already, I ſhall defer the ſame
till another time. And therefore here I will conclude,

their accuſtomed duty, or went beyond the modeſty

            <p>Theſe words contain the Maſters anſwer to the
Propoſition which by the ſervants was preſented in
the former verſe. We may behold therein theſe two
general parts, His Power, His Providence. His Power
firſt, that he was not bound to give obedience to
their counſels, or to ſubmit his judgement unto their
opinions: His Providence, in having ſuch a tender
care of his own good ſeed, as not to yield unto the
gathering of the Tares in the way propoſed, for fear
the Wheat might have incurred ſome danger by it.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:168623:114"/>
His Power we finde no otherwiſe ſet forth unto us
then in a bare diſſent, a plain negative voice, <hi>&amp; ait
non,</hi> but he ſaid nay: he did not like of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and therefore was not bound to aſſent unto
it. His Providence, firſt that he left them not unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but layd them down a reaſon of his Reſolution;
and then in giving ſuch a reaſon as counterballanced
their deſires of a quick diſpatch, and made them ſee
the error of their former haſt; <hi>Ne fortè colligentes
Zizania,</hi> leſt while ye gather up the Tares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which
reaſon, though but one in ſhew, that is to ſay, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Wheat, the good Seed it ſelf, doth
yet contain as many reaſons as there are ſeverall
wayes and meanes, by which in gathering the Tares
they might have rooted up the Wheat alſo. For go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the way by themſelves intended, which was in
<hi>ere gladii,</hi> as before was told you, either in the
violence of their proceedings they might have
rooted up the Tares and the Wheat together; or
elſe by prejudice or inadvertency have taken that
for Tares which indeed was Wheat; or finally, by
too much haſt and precipitation have deſtroyed
ſome Tares which might in time have proved good
Wheat, and ſo become a plentiful addition to the
Lords Harveſt. And therefore <hi>non,</hi> he did not like
of their intention, nor would give way unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
which they brought unto him, <hi>ne fortè,</hi> leſt
under colour and pretence of gathering the Tares in
the way propounded, <hi>eradicetur ſimul cum eis triticum,</hi>
the Wheat, the Lords own Seed, might be rooted
up. Theſe are the points to be obſerved, and theſe I

That were to alter and invert the whole courſe

high degree of Arrogance in the ableſt ſervant, to
think that his adviſe muſt needs be followed; and as
great weakneſs in the Maſter, ſhould he ſubmit to
every propoſition which is tendered him by
thoſe whoſe Counſel he requires in his great
affaires.</p>
            <p>The Maſter in my Text did better underſtand
himſelf and his place then ſo: And therefore though
the propoſition which was made unto him was both
fair and ſpecious, and ſeemed moſt clearly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the advancement of his ſervice, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good; yet he rejects it with a <hi>non,</hi> he refuſed it
utterly. He neither liked their <hi>imus,</hi> though they
came with courage; nor their <hi>Colligimus,</hi> although it
were accompanied with zeal and chearfulneſs; nor
indeed any thing at all in the Propoſition, but that
they cloſed it with a <hi>vis,</hi> and did refer it wholly unto
his diſcretion. And he accordingly made uſe of that
power and priviledge which properly and naturally
was inherent in him; not putting out his own eyes,
in hope to ſee the better by their Spectacles; much
leſſe denying the uſe of his own reaſon, that they
might the more abound in their own ſenſe. But as a
negative voyce had been veſted in him, both by the
Lawes of nature, and the rules of <hi>Occonomy,</hi> ſo he is
reſolved to let them ſee, that as well now when he
was compaſſed round with dangers, and his field in
ſuch a way to ruine, as formerly in the beſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureſt
times, he knew how to uſe it, and when 'twas
fit to ſtand upon it. Nay though the Propoſition
was of no leſſe moment then the preſervation of the
Church, and they that moved it to him of no lower
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:168623:116"/>
rank then <hi>Magiſtri &amp; praeceptores Eccleſiae,</hi> the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and inſtructers of the Church, as St. <hi>Hierome</hi>
tells us, yet he ſtill kept himſelf to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,
<hi>Et ait non,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hieron.</hi> in Matth:</note> 
               <hi>But he ſaid nay.</hi> He would not
put the Sword into their hands when they went a

they thought no way to be ſo effectual for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

            <p>Nor was this any new Authority which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
had uſurped againſt former precedents, but ſuch
as he had uſed and practiſed upon all occaſions. For
if our Saviour be the Maſter in the preſent Parable,
(as no doubt he was) it was no newes in him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
this way, and ſtand upon his own Prerogative,
when either his own Honour, or the Churches ſafety
did depend upon it. St. <hi>Peter</hi> doubtleſs did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that it concerned his Maſter in point of ſafety
not to go down unto <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16. v. 21.</note> where he was like
to be deſpitefully intreated by the Prieſts and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees;
and therefore laboured to diſſwade him from
that dangerous journey. And this moſt probably he
did, with the conſent, and on the motion of all the
reſt of the Apoſtles, whoſe mouth he was, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as the Father calls him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> in Matth.</note> But whether it
were ſo or no, no queſtion but the counſel did
proceed from that true affection which the Apoſtle
carried towards his Lord and Maſter, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
he had to the little Flock, whoſe preſervation
and ſupport depended, as he thought, on the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
ſafety. And yet our Saviour did not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve
the counſel,<note place="margin">v. 23.</note> but told him plainly to his face,
<hi>quia non ſapis ca quae Dei ſunt,</hi> that it did too much
ſavor of the World, and of God too little. And the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:168623:116"/>
two Sonnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> did believe as ſtrongly, that
it as much concerned him in point of honour not to
put up that foul affront which had been offered him
by the <hi>Samaritans;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> v. 54.</note> and therefore made this motion
to him, <hi>vis dicamus ut deſcendat ignis?</hi> ſhall we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that fire come down from Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
theſe wretches? Which motion, though it
aroſe from a juſt reſentment of that indignity and
wrong which had been done unto their Maſter, yet
did their Maſter abſolutely reject the ſame,<note place="margin">v. 55.</note> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome diſlike of their fervor in it; <hi>Neſcitis cujus
ſpiritus eſtis,</hi> in the words next after. In both it is to
be obſerved, that the Lord did not put them off with
any dilatory Anſwer, as if he either wanted time to
conſider of it, or were afraid to ſtand upon his juſt
prerogative; but gave them a refuſal in plain termes,
and gave it with a check to boot, to let them ſee
how ſenſible he was of his own Authority.</p>
            <p>Nor was it otherwiſe in this caſe with the Sonne
of <hi>David,</hi> then with <hi>David</hi> formerly; who though
he had a patient ear, and was content to heare
his Servants, (and in matters of the higheſt points,
both of life and Soveraignty,) yet he conceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be left at liberty either to diſſent or aſſent,
as he thought moſt fit. Upon which principle of
power,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. v. 4.</note> and point of liberty, he abſolutely refuſed
to hearken to the counſel of his Men of Warre, when
they adviſed him to make uſe of the opportunity
which the Lord had given him in delivering <hi>Saul</hi>
into his hands. And though he found by many clear
ſignes and apparent circumſtances,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> that the Sonnes

yet he conceived himſelf not bound to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
their counſels, or to aſſent to every propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they made unto him. And therefore when
they preſſed him for the death of <hi>Shimei,</hi> who had
ſo utterly reviled him in the day of his tribulation,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. v. 21, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note>
that nothing more could have been acceptable to the
common people then ſuch a gratefull piece of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
he had reſort unto his negative, &amp; refuſed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to give way unto it. The reaſons which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to diſſent, I regard not here: Tis plain, he
thought himſelf at liberty to aſſent, or not; and tis
as plain, that he made uſe thereof when he ſaw occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and yet was never quarrelled for it, or thought
to have uſurped a power which belonged not to him.
<hi>David</hi> had bin in a worſe condition then the meaneſt
Subject, if he had been nothing but a State-Eccho,
neceſſitated to repeat thoſe words which his ſervants
did preſcribe and dictate to him; if <hi>ait, aio, negat,
nego,</hi> which was the <hi>Paraſites</hi> part in the Roman
Theatre, had been all the part he was to act on the
Stage of Government.</p>
            <p>But to return unto my Parable; It ſeemes the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
were as well perſwaded of their Maſters Power
in this particular, as the Maſter was; and thereupon
ſubmitted without more diſpute to his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
They came not to him out of Complement, or
<hi>tentandi cauſâ,</hi> to try what metall he was made of,
whether he would give way or not unto their deſires;
and if not, then to carve themſelves, and to proceed
in their own way, to the contempt and ſcorn of his
Authority. Tis true, that ſome of the Diſciples had
ſo ſerved him once, in the great caſe of the Militia:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:168623:117"/>
They came unto him with a Queſtion, <hi>Domine, ſi per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutimus

               <note place="margin">Luk. 22. v. 49:</note>

of them puts himſelf into a poſture of Warre, and
drawes his Sword, and gives the onſet, as if they had
ſufficiently complied with the Obligation wherein
they ſtood bound to their Lord and Maſter, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him before hand what they meant to do. But ſo
it was not with the Servants of my preſent Text; all
which they did, and all they thought they had to do
was to make the motion; and having made the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to expect his Anſwer: which as in duty they
were bound to conform unto, ſo in compliance with
that duty, they deſiſted preſently from proſecuting
their own projects. No ſooner had they found by
their Maſters Anſwer, that they had been miſtaken
in the time and inſtruments in and by which ſo great
a buſineſs was to be effected, but they gave over the
purſuit, and left the work to be performed by the
Heavenly Angel, to whom their Maſter had reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it. No further ſpeech of <hi>imus &amp; colligimus,</hi> after
their Lord and Maſter had returned a <hi>non.</hi>

            <p>And certainly this moderation and ſubmiſſion of
themſelves to their Maſters pleaſure ſhewed excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
lowly, and tends not more unto the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of their modeſty, then of their piety. In vain

that he was <hi>liber agens,</hi> not bound to tell them any
more of his reſolutions then he had a minde to; and
that it was a ſpeciall favour, if he told them any thing
which he might lawfully have kept within the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of his own boſom. The Maſter of a Family is a
Petit-Prince, eſpecially as the paternal power ſtood
fortified in our Saviours time, the Father having
then <hi>poteſtatem vitae &amp; necis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Minſiner. in Inſtitut. lib. 1. tit. 9.</note> the power of life and
death over all the Houſhold. And for the exerciſe
thereof, <hi>He ſaith to this man, Go, he goeth; and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 8. v. 9.</note> 
               <hi>he cometh; and to a third, Do this, he doth it:</hi>
In no caſe bound to give a reaſon for any of thoſe
ſeverall Commands he layes upon them, or to ſet
out a Declaration of thoſe grounds and motives
which might induce him to diſſent in opinion from
them. But if he pleaſe to let them ſee ſo farre into
him of his own accord, it is to be interpreted for an
act of Grace, as it relates unto themſelves; though
poſſibly it be an act of eſpecial providence, is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
upon the ſervice. The ſervant is then moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to the Maſters pleaſure, and takes moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
the refuſal of his profered ſervice, when it
is ſweetned by ſome plauſible prevailing reaſons.</p>
            <pb n="216" facs="tcp:168623:120"/>
            <p>And ſo we finde it in this caſe; The Servants of the
Text had performed their duty, in making a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Tares, and in the offer which they made to
go and gather them before they had deſtroyed the
Harveſt. An offer not to have been ſlighted, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
lightly over, but that the Maſter ſaw more in it
then the ſervants did, and found it could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
without greater danger to his field then the
Tares did threaten. Which being viſible to him,
though unſeen by them, he thought it not amiſſe to
acquaint them with it, and let them ſee the error
they were fallen upon, in offering ſuch a remedy to
remove the miſchief as would have been more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
then the Tares themſelves which they
made offer to remove. A miſchief which the ſervants
did not think of when they came before him, being
tranſported then by their zeal and courage; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
might not have diſcerned it upon ſecond
thoughts. Though they were men of excellent and
diſcerning Spirits, yet they were but men, and could
not look ſo farre into the iſſue and ſucceſs of things
as the more penetrating eye of Almighty God. <hi>Nil

clearly how infinitely ſhort they were of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

that ſo they might perceive the danger of their

            <p>A reaſon then was given, but what reaſon was it?
A reaſon certainly which counterbalanced their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of a quick diſpatch, and made them ſee the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of their former haſte. The way in which they
meant to go was <hi>in ore gladii,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to cut them off not only from the

hath it; to raiſe an holy Warre (if I may ſo call
it) which ſhould have had ſome influence <gap reason="foreign">

over all the Quarters of the World, as
we finde in <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> And had they gone this way
to work, as they meant to do, no doubt but in the
violence of their proceedings, they would have root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up the Wheat and the Tares together. The
Sword, though never ſo well ſharpned, is but an ill
diſtinguiſher between Tares and Wheat: and Warre
the moſt improper Judge that was ever thought of
to determine Controverſies in Religion. Where the
Sword ſtrikes, it ſtrikes on both ſides; it is <hi>gladius
Delphicus,</hi> and makes as little difference between
the Doctrines, as between the Teachers. And when
Warre rageth in a Nation, it beares all before it:
Hallowed places and prophane, the innocent perſon
and the guilty are all alike involved in the ſame ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.
We may affirm of them, as the good Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth of the dreadful Thunder-bolts, <hi>Sine delectu
tangunt loca ſacra &amp; profana; homines noxios feriunt,
ſaepe &amp; religioſos.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Minut. Fel. Apol.</note> But <hi>ſaepe</hi> will not ſerve our turn, it
muſt be <hi>Saepius,</hi> or elſe nothing; and ſo indeed it
proves moſt commonly. For when the Sword and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:168623:121"/>
Warre are to act their Tragedies, the beſt and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
men ſpeed worſt, as they who leaſt know how to
time it, and to comply with the iniquities of the
place they live in. And therefore <hi>ſaeviente ardore
belli meliores potius occumbere,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> ſaith mine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
rightly. But never is the Sword more fatally,
nor more unhappily imployed, then when tis mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by thoſe men who ought to know no other
Weapons then the Sword of the Spirit: no Warre
more cruel and unnatural, then when the bellows of
ſedition which inflames the State, are blown by thoſe
who ſhould be Miniſters of peace. <hi>Ne fortè</hi> is good
counſel here: No <hi>imus &amp; colligimus</hi> in the way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
for fear of rooting up more Wheat then
Tares in the proſecution.</p>
            <p>The dangerouſneſs of this deſign we ſhall further
ſee, if we look firſt upon the Tares, what is meant
by them; and then upon the Servants, of what rank
they were, who were ſo hot upon the ſervice, upon
the <hi>imus &amp; colligimus</hi> of the former verſe. Firſt,
for the Tares,<note place="margin">V. the 2d Sermon on this Parable.</note> beſides that many, if not moſt of the
ancient Fathers interpret them of falſe opinions, of
<hi>haereſes &amp; mala dogmata;</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and others
do expound them of the Hereticks, of the men
themſelves. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſeemes to make a queſtion,
whether the Schiſmatick be not alſo comprehended
in them; and <hi>Cyprian</hi> conceives it of the wicked ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
as do alſo others. But be it which it will, it
comes all to one. Warre and the Sword are but of
little uſe God knowes in the confuting of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
or the converting of the ſinner, or the reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Schiſmatick to the Fold of Chriſt. <hi>Non
tali auxilio:</hi> the Lord hath choſen other meanes, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:168623:121"/>
other Miniſters for the performance of theſe ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and needs no ſuch helps. How farre, and in whoſe
hands they may be ſerviceable for the correction of
the wicked, we ſhall ſee anon. In the mean time we
muſt take notice, that by the Servants in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
are meant the Rulers of Chriſts Church, <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri
&amp; Praeceptores Eccleſiae,</hi> as before I told you
out of <hi>Hierome;</hi> to whom our Saviour gave the
keyes, and the Church afterwards the <hi>Crozier,</hi> or
the Paſtoralls Staffe, the badge and emblem of their
Office. But neither our Saviour nor the Church gave
them any power to take the Sword into their hands,
or to proceed <hi>in ore gladii,</hi> when they found any
thing amiſſe in life or Doctrine which ſtood in need
of Reformation.</p>
            <p>Look upon which of theſe you will, either upon
the Servants or upon the Tares, and we ſhall quickly
finde that the Sword and Warre are never more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly
uſed, then by ſuch men, and in ſuch caſes. For
the Tares being ſowen <hi>in medio tritici,</hi> amongſt the
Wheat, <hi>v.</hi> 25. and growing intermingled with it
in the blade or ſtalk, <hi>v.</hi> 26. if the Sword chance to
mow them down, down go both alike. And ſhould
the Field be weeded by the hand of Warre, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it is but that in gathering up the Tares <hi>eradice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
ſimul cum eis triticum,</hi> the Wheat muſt needes
be rooted up at the ſelf-ſame time. <hi>Bonorum malo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque

               <note place="margin">Min. Fel.</note> 
               <hi>merita confuſa.</hi> The wicked and

are all alike ſubject unto thoſe calamities which the
Warre brings upon a Nation; their Perſons, their
Eſtates, their Families, all comprehended in the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:168623:122"/>
maſſe of the ſame perdition: which as they are the
ordinary conſequents of the Sword and Warre, ſo do
they fall moſt heavily on the Church of Chriſt;
when the Sword is put into unskilful hands, who
neither have a right unto it, nor the Art to uſe it; or
when the Warre is undertaken and purſued under the
mask and colour of Religion. When once the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as they claim to be, laid aſide the
keyes, and betook themſelves unto the Sword, what
havock did they make in the Chriſtian Church? how
often have they died their Robes in the blood of the
Saints? And when the Warre begun by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Princes on the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hiſtor. Albigenſ.</note> was turned
upon the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> by the Popes of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that
the <hi>Cruciata</hi> was proclaimed againſt thoſe poor ſouls,
only becauſe they differed in ſome points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

hundred thouſands of well-meaning men, who made
a conſcience of their wayes, and erred not, (if they
erred at all) out of pride, but ignorance, were rooted
up, and made a ſacrifice to the offended Deities of
the Roman Conclave?</p>
            <p>The miſeries of thoſe Warres, and the nature of
them, are but a Glaſſe, wherein we may behold the

God, ſaith he, would not let the Hereticks be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Warres, for fear the righteous perſon and the
true believer ſhould alſo ſuffer with them in the ſame
deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But what will ſome men ſay? Is there no uſe of
the Sword at all in the confounding of the Heretick,
or the reclaiming of the Schiſmatick, or the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the wicked and flagitious perſon? I ſay not
ſo; the Sword may have its uſe in all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
and Warres be ſerviceable in ſome of them: But
then the Sword muſt be committed to the hands of
the proper Miniſter, not to the Servants of my Text,
or any Miniſter of the Goſpel of what rank ſoever;
and Warres muſt be denounced and purſued by thoſe
in whom the ſupreme Government of the State is

them hath their ſeveral way, and their ſeverall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
in the effecting of this work; but each of them
muſt ſtay the time. The Heretick is firſt to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by the power of the word, by which <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi>

Doctrine, but reproof. It is the faithful word, as he
elſewhere tells us, by which the Prelate is inabled not
only to exhort,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 9.</note> but convince gainſayers. The ſame
courſe muſt be alſo taken in the recovery of the
Schiſmatick, in reduction of the ſtray-ſheep to the
Fold of Chriſt: it being the duty of the diligent and
careful Shepherd to ſeek out that which was loſt,<note place="margin">Ezech. 34.</note>
and bring back that which was driven away. Which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:168623:123"/>
meanes, if they ſhould prove to be ineffectual, and that
the word and Doctrine will not work the cure, it then
pertains unto the Paſtor to have recourſe unto the

were it ſo, in caſe the Magiſtrate might not uſe
the Sword when he ſaw occaſion, or will not uſe
the ſame when he may and ought, God needed
not have put the Sword into his hands. A Scabbard
and a pair of Hilts would have ſerved the turn. And
as for Warre, it is the laſt remedy which a Prince
can uſe for the correction of a ſtubborn and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
people; not to be thought on, nor imbraced, but
in great extremities. Warre is then only juſt when it
is neceſſary, and can no longer be avoided; and then
too to be uſed with alloyes and temperaments, as
Poyſons are ſometimes in a Courſe of Phyſick. That

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:168623:125"/>
men may be condemned for lewd and reprobate;
ſome Orthodox and true opinions rejected as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound
and dangerous.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the men themſelves, let us look on them,
and we ſhall finde that tis not only probable, as before
tis ſaid, but even of ordinary courſe for the beſt men
to be traduced, and to be branded with ſome Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of reproach and infamy. Our Saviour Chriſt
himſelf did not ſcape ſo well but that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a Samaritan, a Wine bibber and a glutton, a
friend of Publicans and ſinners. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſtands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
by the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> for a forward fellow, a
raſh and inconſiderate perſon:<note place="margin">Cent. 1.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> by the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
for an idle prater, a ſetter forth of ſtrange
Gods,<note place="margin">Acts 17. 18.</note> a babler. And who is he of all the gallant
Spirits in the Primitive times, who is not branded on
record for inceſtuous mixtures, thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
remembred and confuted in
the works of our Chriſtian Advocates?<note place="margin">Juſtin M.</note> Prejudice
blindes the eyes as much as malice, and inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
betrayes the judgement to an error with as great
facility as either. If we be biaſſed with the one, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
will be accounted vice, obedience treaſon, loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
rebellion; and upon thoſe whom we finde guilty
of thoſe crimes an <hi>imus &amp; colligimus</hi> ſhall be paſſed
immediately. If we are governed by the other, and
judge of men according to the Character which the
World gives of them, each light report or fooliſh
fear, or ſlight ſuſpicion, ſhall ſerve for a ſufficient
ground to condemn the innocent; and though he be
right Wheat indeed of the Lords own ſowing, vote
him to be a Tare, and the work is done, the <hi>imus &amp;
colligimus</hi> will come after as a thing of courſe. Good
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:168623:125"/>
reaſon therefore had the Maſter to reſtrain his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
to check them in the midſt of their hot purſuit,
and not to let them go and gather, <hi>quòd multi falſo
deferuntur qui ſanctimoniam &amp; pietatem in occulto co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt,</hi>
conſidering how eaſie a thing it is for the beſt
men to be miſreported, and ſo accordingly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And what he ſaid to them he ſaies to us and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
on the like occaſions; there's no ſuch need of
<hi>imus &amp; colligimus</hi> as we think there is.</p>
            <p>So is it alſo with opinions, with ſome points of
Doctrine, which if beheld with prejudice, or inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently
looked over, will be counted Tares, though
in themſelves of that good ſeed wherewith Gods
Field was ſowed from the firſt beginning. There is
ſo ſpecious a reſemblance, ſuch a fair ſimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the merit of good works, and the reward that's
due unto them according to the will and pleaſure of
Almighty God; between the efficacy of good life
in the point of juſtification, and the neceſſity thereof
in the way of ſalvation; between the influence of <hi>Gods</hi>
grace on the will of man, &amp; the cooperation of mans
will with the grace of God; between the conſcientious
confeſſion of our ſins to thoſe from whom we may
receive the benefit of abſolution, and that auricular
Confeſſion which hath been ſo abuſed of late by
ſome Prieſts and Jeſuites; between the reverence
required at the receiving of the Sacrament in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that unjuſtifiable Adoration
of it which is obtruded on the people in the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> between the dedicating of ſome dayes to
the honour of God, with a relation to the creature,
and a devoting of them to the creature with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
unto God; that the true Tenet in thoſe points,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:168623:126"/>
as in many others, commended to us in the writings
of the ancient Fathers, if eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> looked upon with
the eye of prejudice, or through the falſe lights of
inadvertence, may be took for Tares. And what can
follow thereupon but an eradication of the Tenet
and the Teachers too, if every man may go and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when and where he liſteth, and that <hi>ne fortè</hi> be
not laid as a barre before them by their Lord and
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſter? Indeed there is no reaſon we ſhould look for
other, or that the Doctrines of the Fathers may not
paſſe for Tares, when the Apoſtles Creed it ſelf is
ſubject to the ſame miſpriſion; one of the Articles
whereof hath been already noted with a <hi>Deleatur,</hi> and
all the reſt obnoxious to the like calamity, on the
next <hi>imus &amp; colligimus,</hi> upon the ſetting out of the
<hi>Expurgatorius Index</hi> which is now in hand.</p>
            <p>Therefore to ſet the matter right, that neither zeal
may be diſheartned, nor the edge of courage taken
off, and yet that <hi>imus &amp; colligimus</hi> may both be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and reſtrained to its proper bounds; there's a
<hi>ne fortè</hi> in the way, which ſhewes how farre it is fit
to go, and when fit to ſtop. We muſt ſo cheriſh zeal,
and give way to courage, that the Lords work may
be promoted, and his Field preſerved; and yet ſo
curb and keep them in when they grow irregular,
that they tranſport us not beyond our limits, or
make us run upon miſtakes. Zeal many times is full
of prejudice, and an exceſs of courage makes us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate.
In both theſe caſes, (and they are ſuch
caſes as do happen often) we are not governed by
truth, but by appearances; and he that is good
Wheat indeed is looked upon as a Tare, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
accordingly. He that beholds his Brother
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:168623:126"/>
with the eye of prejudice, either looks on him
through a Multiplying Glaſſe, which makes his faults
ſeem greater then indeed they be; or by ſome new
invented Optick, which repreſents things contrary
to what they are.<note place="margin">Acts 12. 2, 3.</note> And he that doth condemn a man
on no other grounds then the opinion and eſteem
which the world hath of him, is but like <hi>Herod</hi> in the

as in moſt things elſe; which had it been regarded
as it ſhould have been, ſo many points of Proteſtant
Doctrine had not been rooted up for Tares, under

other good Authors do agree, ſo is it further verified
and confirmed by thoſe who are habituated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
in the Arts of Husbandry.</p>
            <p>Which being ſo, conſidering that the Wheat, the
good ſeed it ſelf degenerates ſometimes into Tares,
there is no queſtion to be made but that the Tares
by care and husbandry may be reſtored in time to
their firſt perfection, and prove Wheat again. The
Fathers do reſolve it ſo, eſpecially as they behold it
in the Morall, and look on the condition of ſuch
mortall men as in the Tares are repreſented. For if
by Tares we mean the Heretick, <hi>Fieri poteſt ut ille
qui noxio dogmate depravatus eſt, cras reſipiſcat, &amp;
defendere incipiat veritatem:</hi> Tis not impoſſible,
ſaith St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> but that the man who is infected

reaſon of the Maſters Negative; for had the Servants
gone the way which themſelves propounded, they
had wronged the Harveſt. How ſo? in rooting up
the Wheat:<note place="margin">Gorran.</note> what Wheat? <hi>futurum triticum,</hi> that
which in fine would have proved Wheat, as one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath it, <hi>quod pia praeſumptione,</hi> which we may
charitably preſume would prove Wheat in time; <hi>quod
fieri poteſt triticum,</hi> which by the diligence and care
of the ſpiritual Husbandman, may be made Wheat
at laſt, though it now be none, as ſome others tell us.
The Fathers generally do incline this way: <hi>Monemur

ſo great or greater was the difference between his

then in the proceſs of this Parable, comparing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

thought there was no ſafer way to ſecure the

which had been ſowen during their negligence and
ſecurity by the crafty enemy. To this end they made
offer of their help and ſervice, <hi>vis imus &amp; colligimus

and they expected thanks at leaſt for the propoſition,
if not an approbation of their courſe and Counſel.
But contrary, their Maſter ſeeing further then the
ſervants could, and being apprehenſive of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which might follow on it, had their advice been

abſolute Negative,<note place="margin">v. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Et ait Non, but he ſaid Nay,</hi> he did

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:168623:131"/>
to the Field of God, then the tares themſelves
did ſeem to threaten. And more then ſo, he lets them
ſee, (which all the wiſdom of the world would have
never thought of) that the beſt way to ſave the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,
and preſerve the Wheat, was to permit the tares
and wheat to grow up together till they were ready
for the Reapers; and then to gather them and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them in their proper places, according to the
will and pleaſure of the Lord their God. This the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
of the Text with the former paſſages, this
the Text it ſelf, <hi>Sinite utraque, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe words we have theſe two general parts to
be conſidered; the ſufferance of Almighty God, and
the ſeaſon of it: 2ly. the condition of the Church, and
the cauſes of it: the ſufferance of Almighty God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſinful man, in the firſt word <hi>Sinite,</hi> ſuffer them
both to grow together; the ſeaſon of it in the laſt,
<hi>uſque ad meſſem,</hi> till the Harveſt. The condition of the
Church repreſented to us in the intermixture of the
Wheat and Tares, both which are here permitted
<hi>ſimul creſcere,</hi> to grow up together till the Harveſt:
the cauſes of this intermixture not expreſſed <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi>
but to be found, if ſought for, without much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe.
In the firſt generall we ſhall examine theſe
three points; 1. What is meant by <hi>meſsis,</hi> the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching
Harveſt, and the uſe thereof. 2. What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
the Heavenly Husbandman to give ſo long a
<hi>ſinite</hi> to the Tares, when meanes and opportunity was
offered for their extirpation. And 3. Whether the
<hi>ſinite</hi> of the Text delivered in the Imperative mood,
be ſo ſtrong and binding, that in no caſe the tares are
to be rooted out till the Harveſt come. In the next
generall we ſhall ſhew you, 1. That the Church here
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:168623:132"/>
militant is of ſuch condition, that good and bad, the
Orthodox Profeſſor and the Heretick, are ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled,
that there is no perfection to be looked for
here: and 2. That there want not great and weighty
reaſons why it ſhould ſo be; of which ſome relate
unto the Tares, ſome unto the Wheat, ſome to God
himſelf, whoſe glory is moſt chiefly aimed at. Theſe
are the points to be conſidered: and of theſe I ſhall
diſcourſe in order, beginning with Gods ſufferance,
and the ſeaſon of it, and therein with the firſt enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
What is here meant by <hi>meſsis,</hi> the approching
Harveſt; and what uſe we may make thereof for our
own advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Priùs dividendum quàm definiendum;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tull.</note> It was the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
Rule of old, Firſt to diſtinguiſh of the termes,
before we take upon us to ſtate the queſtion. A Rule
exceeding neceſſary in the preſent buſineſs, and
much conducing to the Explication of the points in
hand. For the word <hi>meſsis</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a word of
various ſignifications, according to the ſcope of the
ſeverall places where it doth occur. And firſt, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of it in the literall ſenſe in the 9th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 7.</note> it ſignifieth the times and ſeaſons
fit for the preaching of the Goſpel. There read we
<hi>meſſem eſſe multam,</hi> that the Harveſt was great, <hi>i. e.</hi>
that there were many people whoſe mindes were
cheerfully prepared to receive the word. And there's
another Harveſt which the Baptiſt ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> the
bringing forth of fruits meet for repentance, fruits
worthy of the Preachers pains, and the hearers dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Harveſt of good
works which we finde in <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In locum.</note> But we have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Corn to threſh, and therefore muſt look out for
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:168623:132"/>
another Harveſt; an Harveſt not of hearing, nor of
fructifying, but of receiving the reward of our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
labours; an Harveſt in the which each workman
ſhall receive his wages, according to the works which
he hath wrought in the fleſh, whether good or evill.
And this again is either taken for the day of Gods
temporall judgements upon particular Men, or Sects,
or Collective bodies; or for the day of generall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when all fleſh ſhall appear before the Lord to
receive its ſentence. In this laſt ſenſe the word is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the 14 of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where the Angel
ſaid to him that ſate upon the Throne, <hi>mitte falcem
&amp; mete, Thruſt in thy ſickle and reap, for the time is
come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and the Harveſt of the Earth is ripe, i. e.</hi> all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were now ready to receive that judgement
which God in his juſt anger ſhould pronounce againſt
them. And in the other ſenſe it is ſaid by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Jeremy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 51. v. 30.</note> 
               <hi>The Daughter of</hi> Babylon <hi>is a threſhing-floore,
the time of her threſhing is come, yet a little while
and the time of her Harveſt will come. Tempus meſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
ejus veniet;</hi> and what time was that? even that
wherein ſhe had made up the meaſure of her iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and abominations, and was to be given up for a
prey to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know that moſt Interpreters, as well old as new,
do take the Harveſt in my Text for the generall
judgement, that which our Saviour doth deſcribe in
the 25. of this Goſpel: And they expound it thus for
this reaſon chiefly, becauſe our Saviour gives this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcant
on his own plain ſong, v. 39. <hi>Meſsis eſt conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio
ſeculi,</hi> the Harveſt is the end of the World.
A man would think the ſenſe muſt be very obvious,
even to the vulgar wits, when he that writ the Text
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:168623:133"/>
made the comment alſo. But then a queſtion may be
made what our Redeemer meanes by <hi>conſummatio
ſeculi,</hi> or the end of the World, or the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as the Greek Text hath it. Aſſuredly not
alwayes the laſt day preciſely, but the laſt times ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
or the particular time appointed by Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God for the effecting of ſome ſpeciall and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
purpoſe. For in the 9 Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
the ſame words occur, where the Apoſtle treating of
the paſſion of our Lord and Saviour, ſaith it was
done <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in conſummatione ſeculi,</hi>
in the end of the World.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Beza</hi> in Heb. 9.</note> Ask <hi>Beza</hi> what is meant
there by the end of the World, by the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and he will tell you that it is the ſame which
the Apoſtle calls in another place <hi>plenitudinem tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris,</hi>
or the fulneſs of time, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſaith he, and ſo
both <hi>Caietan</hi> and <hi>Ribera</hi> do expound the Text, <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum
perfectionem &amp; complementum,</hi> the full perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and accompliſhment of ſome time appointed.</p>
            <p>So then upon this diſquiſition we have gained thus
much, that though the Harveſt in my Text be for
the moſt part underſtood of the general judgement,
of which hereafter in the next; yet may it alſo mean
the time of Gods temporal puniſhments upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men, or Sects, or Collective bodies: Whom
though God ſuffereth for a while till their ſins be
ripe, and lets them flouriſh and grow mighty both in
power and wickedneſs, yet have they all their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Harveſts, in which they ſhall be mowed, and
threſhed, and winnowed, to his greater glory. The
ſickle of the Lord is alwayes ready,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> and his van al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in his hand. And when his Harveſt-time is
come, and the fruits of wicked men be ripe, he ſhall
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:168623:133"/>
not only mowe them down,<note place="margin">Eſay 17. 5.</note> 
               <hi>as when the Harveſt-man
gathereth the corn, and reapeth down the eares with his
arme,</hi> in the Prophets language; but he will
throughly purge his floore, and make them like the
chaffe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.</note> in the Pſalmiſts words, which the wind drives
away before it. But for the juſt and righteous perſon,
he either ſhall be ſaved from the day of trouble, or
preſerved in it: Or if he fall, as fall he may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into the hand of the Reapers, like a good eare
of corn well grown, or Grapes fully ripe, he ſhall be
<hi>congregatus in horreum,</hi> gathered into the barn of the
heavenly Husbandman. In execution of which acts
of his will and juſtice he many times makes uſe of
Angels, literally and properly ſo called, which are the
Reapers of this verſe and the 39, and many times
of other Miniſters who do ſupply the place of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and may be called ſo in a borrowed, meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall
ſenſe; as <hi>Attila</hi> the <hi>Hun,</hi> the ſcourge of the
impenitent Weſtern Chriſtians, was in the Stories
of thoſe times called <hi>Flagellum Dei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there have been ſuch Harveſts in former
times, and that ſuch Harveſts are in the compaſs of
our Saviours meaning, the Stories of Gods Book,
and all the Monuments of the Church do moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evidence. And to ſay truth, did not the Text ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſuch Harveſts, all the ſeditious aggregations of
unquiet men; all the Idolatries of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, and
ſuperſtitions of <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſtian; the Pride of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
and the filths of <hi>Sodom,</hi> with all the rabblement
of pernicious Hereticks, and factious Sectaries, which
have diſturbed the Church in foregoing Ages, muſt
be ſtill extant and unpuniſhed to this very day. But
they have had their ſeverall Harveſts, and the Lord
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:168623:134"/>
hath reaped them, reſerving them with the Apoſtate
Angels,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. v. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> in eternall chains, to the judgement of the
great and terrible day. And though this be a truth ſo
clear that it needes no proofs, yet we will inſtance in
ſome few, the better to ſet forth the neceſſary truth
of this, together with the longanimity and juſtice
of Almighty God. In the old World, the ſinnes
of men were very great,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. v. 2, 5.</note> all the imaginations of
their hearts corrupt and evill, ſo that the very Sonnes
of God were tempted to go in to the Daughters of
men; and yet God ſpared them a long time, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
120 yeeres unto the dayes of their repentance.
But when their ſins were grown ſo ripe that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
him at laſt of Mans creation, he brought the
flood upon them, and deſtroyed them all; but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
righteous <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Houſhold with him. The
Citizens of <hi>Sodom</hi> had long ſwelled in pride,<note place="margin">Gen. 7.</note> and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
on fulneſs of bread, and abundance of idleneſs,
as the Prophet tells us;<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.</note> and yet God ſuffered them
to live, and fulfill their luſts. But when the voyce of
their ſins became ſo loud, as to cry unto the Heavens
for vengeance, and to occaſion God himſelf to come
down and ſee <hi>majorne infamia vero,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ovid.</note> whether their ſins
were anſwerable to the cry which was come unto
him,<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 21.</note> then were they ready for the ſickle, 'twas high
Harveſt then; and the Lord ſent his Angels to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
their City,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> and rained down fire from Heaven
upon them; but delivered <hi>Lot</hi> and his ſmall Family,
like a fire-brand ſnatched out of the flames.</p>
            <p>Paſſe we on forwards into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and we ſhall finde
how patiently the Lord expected that the proud <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi>
would at the laſt diſmiſſe his people with
peace and ſafety;<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> but when that did no good upon
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:168623:134"/>
them, when they had added tyranny unto oppreſſion,
and unto both a proud contempt of his Word and
Meſſengers, he brought his people out with a mighty
hand; the Angel of the Lord going before the Camp
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but overwhelming <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt in
a ſecond deluge. And if God did not preſently inveſt
his people in the poſſeſſion of the Land ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
it was not only for their diſobedience, or their
unbelief, nor for their murmuring againſt God, and
groundleſs exclamations againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi>
though theſe did all concur to retard their entrance:
The Scriptures give another reaſon, and queſtionleſs
the true reaſon of that long ſuſpenſion;<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 16.</note> 
               <hi>nondum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleta
eſt iniquitas Amorrhaeorum,</hi> the wickedneſs
of the <hi>Amorites</hi> was not yet full, 'twas not Harveſt
yet, and therefore God had not given order to the
Land to ſpew out her Inhabitants. Thus do we read
in holy Scripture of the Harveſt of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 17. 5. &amp; 51. 33.</note> and of the
Harveſt of <hi>Damaſcus, i. e.</hi> of thoſe appointed times,
in which for their Idolatries and abominations they
were to be delivered over to the hands of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
enemies. And for thoſe very Jewes themſelves,
though God ſpared them long, notwithſtanding all
their provocations, and only viſited them ſometimes
with Warre or thraldom, yet he ſtayed not there; for
when they had made up the meaſure of their Fathers
ſins, and added to the ſame the blood of the Sonne
of God, more precious then the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> and
of all the Prophets, then did the Lord deſtroy their
City, and diſperſe their people, making them that
they were no longer to be called a Nation, but a
poor ſcattered remnant of what once they were. But
for the perſecuted Saints of Chriſt which lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:168623:135"/>
them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Euſeb.</hi> hiſt. l. 3. c. 5.</note> the Lord withdrew them from that

               </gap>, by a Dream

of <hi>Syria,</hi> before the firſt approch of the Roman
Armies.</p>
            <p>Thus was it alſo with the Church ſince the time
of the Goſpel; The Princes of the Earth ſometimes
raged againſt it, and harried it with fire and ſword,
and all kinde of torments: And though the ſouls of
them which were ſlain for the word of the Lord had
cryed unto their God for vengeance,<note place="margin">Apoc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 9, 10, 11.</note> yet was it ſaid
to them from above, <hi>ut requieſcerent adhuc modicum
tempus,</hi> that they ſhould reſt yet for a ſeaſon, and
tarry till their Brethrens blood was caſt into the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
alſo to make up the weight. Which time being
come, the Lord did plague the perſecutors with ſuch
grievous plagues, that in the anguiſh of their ſouls,
and guilt of conſcience, they cryed unto the Rocks
to fall upon them, &amp; on the hills to hide them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

So for thoſe vile and wretched miſcreants which did
afflict the Church of Chriſt with Schiſmes and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,
they did exalt their horns a while, and bare all

almoſt all the parts of the body myſticall: yet when
their pride was greateſt, and their power moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable;
when their impieties and blaſphemies were
ſo ſtrongly backed, that theſe few Orthodox Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
which were left untainted did tremble at the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:168623:135"/>
apprehenſion of the preſent danger, God then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them fit for vengeance, and put in his ſickle,
the time being come for him to reap, and the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
ready; ſo that of all thoſe Sects and Hereſies
which did afflict the Church in her pureſt Ages, there
is ſcarce any thing remaining but the name and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
And though the Chriſtians of thoſe times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delivered from the fear of their deadly enemies,
had ſurfeited on peace and prohibited pleaſures, yet
God reprieved them a long time from the hand of
puniſhment; but when their ſins were grown ſo
publick, and ſo full of ſcandall, <hi>ut pateretur lex Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiana

            <p>Now by this Standard we may take the meaſure
both of Gods patience and his juſtice, in all parallel
Caſes: If we ſee Sects and Hereſies riſe up to diſturb
the Church, and not to riſe up only, but grow ſtrong
and prevalent, and in a way like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſeven lean
Kine to devoure the fat; if we ſee wickedneſs grow
ſucceſsful, and rebellion proſperous, and the beſt men
become a prey to the cruel ſpoylers, we muſt not
think that God is all this while aſleep, and regards it
not;<note place="margin">Pſal. 122.</note> not ſo, <hi>the Lord that keepeth</hi> Iſrael <hi>neither
ſleepes nor ſlumbereth.</hi> But when the ſins of men

ſome of them have the hap, or the ſeeming happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to go down into the grave in peace, yet God
will finde them at the laſt, and meet with theſe ſowre
grapes in his general vintage, and tread them in the
wine-preſſe of his indignation. And to ſay truth,
there are as great and weighty reaſons why ſome
mens puniſhments ſhould follow after them, as that
the reſt ſhould have a trial and eſſay of their future
miſeries by thoſe which they endure in this preſent

Tares to grow up together with the Wheat, it is to
ſhew his patience and longanimity in expectation of
their converſion and amendment; but that he brings
them to the Harveſt, and moweth them down at laſt,
is to ſhew his juſtice. And doubt we not, but that the
Lord in his juſt judgement will deſtroy thoſe Tares
which at this preſent threaten ruine to his bleſſed
Field, when they once be ripe, and that we are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
awakened out of that dull ſecurity which

that is due unto them. But I ſee little hopes
of ſo great a change; or indeed any hopes at all,
either great or little, except it be unto the worſe, in
the corrupting of thoſe meanes which ſhould work
our peace. For tell me I beſeech you, is not our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting

ſo much hypocriſie, that we are ſicker of repentance
then before of ſin? Is not our common talk ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
with oaths and prodigious curſings, as if we
meant to bid defiance to the Hoſt of Heaven? and
our devotions in Gods Houſe ſo cold and careleſs, as
if we thought as poorly of the Lord himſelf, as of the
Preacher, or the Prayers? And can we look for bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
from the hands of God, when we ſend curſes to
his eares? or that the Lord ſhould work a double
miracle upon us, whether we will or not; one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving

forgiving unrepented ſins? Aſſuredly, unleſs we make
our peace with God, and wreſt deliverance from him
by our prayers and penitence, the Lord in his juſt
anger will afflict us further, and give us over for a
prey unto thoſe that hate us. God is not bound to
bring upon the wicked and ſeditious perſon, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick

and Schiſmatical man, the Harveſt of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
judgements, though ſometimes he do it: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he lets them paſſe till the general Harveſt, and
calls them not unto account untill he bring them at

that have been long afflicted with a wounded body,

darkneſs is in the Aire or Firmament, and wounds

How many excellent tractates, grave diſcourſes,
learned and pious writings had theſe Ages wanted,
had not the Primitive Church been exerciſed with ſo

learned men on work to confute and cruſh them? And
doubt we not but that Poſterity will fare the better
for thoſe monſtrous Paradoxes in Divinity which
have been vented ſince the meeting of this new Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,

no otherwiſe with truth then it is with ſaith, beſt

There muſt be hereſies,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, ut qui probati

to curb the Heretick, or ſilence him, or ſuppreſs
his inſolencies, or to prohibit their Aſſemblies, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe

his Church, as to lay it open to the aſſaults and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of malicious enemies, and left her with no
other weapons then defenſive only. In the ſpirituall
Armorie which St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> there is as well the
ſword of the ſpirit, as the ſhield of faith; and truth
appointed for a Girdle, as well as righteouſneſs for a

to convince gainſayers, as well as to exhort, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
the ſinner; and may employ the pen, though
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:168623:139"/>
not toſſe the Pike. Elſe not the Heretick, but the
true Profeſſor would be put to ſilence, and God
ſhould ſend out men to fight, and yet binde their
hands. And more then ſo, the Lord hath given his
Church Authority to deal with obſtinate Hereticks,
and with perverſe Schiſmaticks, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did with

he may uſe the ſame in cutting off the obſtinate He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,
and the perverſe Schiſmatick, after the
Church hath done her part, and that Certificate be
returned of her whole proceedings, is a point worthy
of a further and more punctuall ſearch. At this we
only touched before, referring the full diſquiſition of
it to the preſent <hi>Sinite,</hi> as a place more proper for
that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And firſt perhaps it will be thought but an eaſie
Controverſie, and of no great difficulty to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
in which the diſagreeing parties are ſo well
agreed. The practiſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes it
clear enough what they do hold in point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
although they have not yet improved it (for
ought I can tell) into an Article of the faith, as many

Scripture, and conſent of Fathers, though he bring
ſome ſory proof from either. Our Saviour tells us of

that whoever comes not into the fold by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

and a Robber. <hi>At Lupi rapaces optimo jure occiduntur;</hi>
But Wolves, ſaith he, are juſtly killed, and tis well

thereupon concludes without more adoe, that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
are to be puniſhed like Wolves and Robbers.
Would any man believe that ſo great a Clerk could

becauſe the Scripture likeneth them to a dogg which
returneth to the vomit?<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 22</note> and yet ſuch doggs are oft
times cheriſhed by their Maſters. The Cardinall
had never ſet ſo light a price on the life of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
had he conſidered at how great a price it was
bought by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So alſo for the Proteſtant Doctors, though at the
firſt they did unanimouſly deteſt both the opinion
and the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:168623:141"/>
(and certainly they had good reaſon ſo to do,
as the caſe then ſtood) yet they ſoon altered their
opinion; for after that <hi>Servetus</hi> had been burnt at
<hi>Geneva</hi> by the inſtigation of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Valentine
Gentilis</hi> executed at <hi>Braſil</hi> by the Command of the
<hi>Switzers,</hi> the <hi>Allobrogian</hi> party ſet their wits on work
to defend the action, and after drew in many others
of the Proteſtant Churches to concur with them in
that point. <hi>Calvin</hi> firſt ſets it down <hi>in theſi, haereticos
jure gladii coercendos,</hi> that Hereticks were to be
reſtrained by the Sword of the temporal Magiſtrate;
which though it was in generalls only, yet did he
make it ſerve the turn for the preſent ſhift. But <hi>Beza,</hi>
building a large Tract upon his foundation, entituled,
<hi>De haereticis à Magiſtratu puniendis,</hi> ſets up this Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
almoſt the ſame in termes with that of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
viz. haereticos interdum capitali etiam ſupplicio
à magiſtratu coercendos,</hi> that Hereticks ſometimes
are to be puniſhed by death. For which, though he
produce no evidence from the Evangeliſts or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
which are the beſt Judges in this caſe, but
that of <hi>Ananias</hi> and his Wife <hi>Saphira,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> both whom
St. <hi>Peter</hi> moſt miraculouſly condemned and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a word of his mouth; yet he confeſſeth of
this inſtance, <hi>non poſſe in exemplum trahi,</hi> that it is not
to be drawn into example.<note place="margin">Bez. ibid.</note> And if not to be drawn
into example, as he ſaith it is not, then certainly no
ſuch proof to confirm the point as he thinks it is: yet
that we might not think him ſingular, or to ſtand
alone, he brings in <hi>Bullinger, Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gangus
Capito,</hi> as being of the ſame judgement with
him; to whom <hi>Aretius</hi> might be added, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the proceedings againſt <hi>Valentine Gentile,</hi> and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:168623:141"/>
ſome others ſince: ſo incident it is to our humane
frailty to ſquare our judgement by the rule of our
private intereſts; and not ſo much to ponder what we
ought to do, as to finde Pleas and Arguments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
our doings.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this agreement of the adverſe
parties, we may reſolve upon the queſtion, as our
Redeemer did in another caſe, <hi>quòd ab initio non fuit
ſic,</hi> it was not ſo from the beginning. The Primitive
Fathers knew of no ſuch meanes for the confuting of
an Heretick, or the ſuppreſſing of an Hereſie, as the
fire and faggot. St. <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> judgement in the
point you have heard already, take St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> now;
who tells us of himſelf, that he was once perſwaded,
<hi>neminem ad unitatem Chriſti cogendum eſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auguſt. in Ep. <hi>l.</hi> 48.</note> that no
man was to be compelled by force and puniſhments
to joyn himſelf unto the Church. But afterwards,
upon experience of the peace and benefit which did
moſt commonly redound to the Church thereby, he
ſo farre altered his opinion, as to allow of baniſhment,
or fine and ranſom, in caſe of obſtinate perverſeneſs;
but by no meanes of death in what caſe ſoever. And
this the Cardinall confeſſeth,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Laic. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 21.</note> though againſt himſelf,
ingeniouſly affirming of that holy Father, <hi>ſemper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepero

death as too ſharp a remedy, and inconſiſtent with

it, by whom <hi>Ithacius</hi> was deprived of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
for no other reaſon, then that he had been a

lewd enough of conſcience, if their Opinions
have been tranſmitted to us by ingenious hands) the

what need further ſearch be made in this particular,
when we have <hi>confitentem reum?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Annal. Eccl.</note> For even <hi>Baronius</hi>
doth acknowledge, though otherwiſe a profeſſed
Champion both of the cuſtoms and corruptions of

of the Chriſtian Biſhops, when they addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the ſecular powers in matters of this preſent
nature, ſo to inſiſt on the correction of the Heretick,
<hi>ut tamen à capitali ſupplicio inferendo dehortati ſunt,</hi>
that they diſſwaded them by all meanes imaginable
not to ſhed their bloods. From which ſweet modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Primitive Prelates, how miſerably the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:168623:142"/>
Church hath deviated in theſe latter dayes, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Martyrologies of both ſides do declare too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently.</p>
            <p>What then, may ſome men chance to ſay, ſhall
Theeves and Murderers die the death, which onely
rob us of our goods, or deſtroy our bodies, and ſhall
the Heretick which robs us of our precious faith, and
damn both ſoul and body to the pit of hell, either
eſcape unpuniſhed, or be puniſhed onely with ſome
light pecuniary mulct, or ſhort impriſonment? Is
there no caſe in which the deſperate Heretick may
be rooted up, and ſuch vile tares be liable to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation?
I ſay not ſo. The Lord himſelf decreed
in his holy Law, (and cauſed execution to be done
upon it) <hi>That whoſoever did blaſpheme the name of
the Lord ſhould be ſtoned to death;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 24. v. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and that if a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
did ariſe which did entice the people after other
Gods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 13. v. 1. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>they ſhould alſo ſlay him, without either pity or delay.</hi>
The Jewes, though they tranſgreſſed in the ſecond
caſe, were alwayes zealous in the firſt; and howſoever
they connived at ſome groſſe Idolatries, would not
ſpare a blaſphemy. This made them when they ſate
in judgement on our Saviour Chriſt, to balk all other
Accuſations, and lay hold on this; interpreting ſome
words of his,<note place="margin">Matth. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6. v. 65, 66.</note> in which he called himſelf moſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Sonne of God, for blaſphemous paſſages. And
then the high Prieſt ſaid (with great joy no queſtion)
<hi>what need we any further witneſſes? we have heard
his blaſphemy:</hi> and thereupon they all concluded he
is guilty of death. In which the ground was true and
juſtifiable, it was Gods own Rule; but the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wicked and erroneous, as being utterly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
in the Application. Now though theſe Lawes
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:168623:143"/>
were given particularly to the Jewes for their ſquare
and meaſure, by which they were to puniſh malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of that odious nature; yet in the equity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they relate to us, to whom the honour of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God ought to be as precious as ever it was
among the Jewes, and all blaſphemers of his name
to be held as execrable as in the Commonwealth of
<hi>Iſrael.</hi> If therefore there ariſe an Heretick which
belcheth his blaſphemous follies againſt the Majeſty
of God, or any perſon of the holy undivided Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
or ſeeks to draw the people after other Gods, or
add the Jewiſh Ceremonies, or the heatheniſh ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to the pure worſhip of the Lord, as did the

as ſins, which if unretracted, are neither pardoned in
this World, nor in that to come. Such wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>Next to the Majeſty of God is that of Kings and
Soveraign Princes; to whom God hath not onely
pleaſed to impart his name, but delegated a great
part of his royall power: And therefore if an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
ſet on foot ſuch Doctrines as tend to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Princes perſon, or the ſeducing of his
Subjects from their due allegiance; or otherwiſe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:168623:143"/>
grow practical, and embroyl the State, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of their dreams and dotages, though of
lower quality, let them receive the wages due to
their lewd attempts. There are as well ſeditious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
as ſeditious practiſes, both dangerous alike,
and therefore to be puniſhed with the like ſeverity:
and this have the chief Prieſts of the Jewes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
full well, when having brought our Saviour
to the Judgement-hall, and fearing <hi>Pilate</hi> would be
little moved with the noyſe of blaſphemy, they caſt
their accuſation in another mould; We found (ſay
they) this fellow perverting our Nation, forbidding
to pay tribute unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and calling himſelf Chriſt
a King: &amp; then if <hi>Pilate</hi> will not haſten to his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
he ſhall be inſtantly proclaimed for no friend
of <hi>Caeſars.</hi> In which, although they ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be falſe accuſers, yet they declared ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
that in their opinion, and in the opinion of
a vigilant and careful Magiſtrate, all Doctrines which
may tend to perturb the State, or rather that all
ſuch, whoever, which have raiſed factions in the
State to promote their Doctrines, were worthy of a
<hi>Crucifige.</hi> And ſo farre we may take St. <hi>Paul</hi> along
for Company, who tells us of <hi>coitiones in Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogis,</hi>
ſeditions raiſed in the Synagogues as well
as in the ſtreets or Citie, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. Of either of the
which if his malicious enemies could have proved
him guilty, he had deſerved to die, as himſelf doth
intimate, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. v. 11. And this no queſtion was
the reaſon why ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors proceeded
more ſeverely againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> then againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Hereſies of an higher nature; becauſe they
were an active ſect, and cared not to diſtract or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:168623:144"/>
a Province, ſo they might ſettle their opinions,
and increaſe their Proſelytes: though, to ſay truth
in this and all ſuch parallel caſes, it was their faction
not their faith, not their Religion, but rebellion
which was puniſhed in them. In theſe two caſes, and
theſe onely, dare I ſet any edge on the temporal
Sword, though even in theſe it be a remedy to be
laſt applied; and more to be commended where
it may not, then where it may poſſibly be
ſpared.</p>
            <p>In other caſes where the error lieth in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
although moſt commonly backed with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy
and perverſeneſs in the will and affections,
the adverſe parties in the Church have been too farre
tranſported beyond their bounds, and drawn too
much blood from one another, though both pretend
the Lawes for their juſtification. For who ſeeth not
how little it doth ſavour of the ſpirit of Chriſt, to
hale young boyes, and ſilly women, and poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Tradeſmen to the Funeral-Pile, becauſe they
could not fathom the deep Myſtery of tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
or thought it not an acceptable ſacrifice to
devoure their God; or found not Purgatory in the
Scriptures; or did not think it fit to invocate the
Saints their Brethren, when as the way lay open unto
God their Father; or durſt not give that honour to
a painted Crucifix, which properly belonged to their
crucified Saviour? And on the other ſide, it wants
not reprehenſion amongſt moderate men, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ſhould be dragged unto the Scaffold for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon, then taking ſacred Orders from a forreign
hand, or treading on prohibited ground; not being
otherwiſe convicted by ſufficient evidence, either
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:168623:144"/>
of practiſing againſt the State, or labouring to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Subjects from their natural duties. The
Chriſtians of the Primitive Ages had loſt the moſt
effectual part of their Apologies, if difference in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
only had been a crime ſufficient, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
guilt, to draw thoſe fiery ſtorms upon them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they ſuffered. And though I ſay not of

their juſtification,<note place="margin">Plutarch. in Solo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unto <hi>Draco</hi>'s Lawes of old, which were written in

offence, that they were neither made nor executed
within theſe Dominions, but either when the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon

elſe on thoſe unfortunate wretches, who have ſince
fallen <hi>in regionem Draconum,</hi> into the place of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
as the Pſalmiſt calls it. Certain it is, that by
thoſe bloody executions both ſides have rather been
confirmed then weakned, and both have given ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the growth of Hereſies. Juſt as <hi>Sulpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

that the two Cities which he was to write of, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Lord, and the City of Satan, were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled,
that there was little hope to ſee them
ſeparated till the day of Judgement: The ſame may
we affirm of the Church of Chriſt; it is of ſuch a
mixt condition, compounded ſo proportionably of
the good and evil, the Heretick and true Profeſſor,
that neither of the two is likely to ſuppreſs the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till God take up the controverſie in the day of
doom. And therefore not without good reaſon is
the Church compared to a threſhing-floore,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 12.</note> on
which there is both wheat and chaffe; and to a Fold,
wherein there are both Sheep and Goats;<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 33.</note> and to a
caſting-net, which being thrown into the Sea, drew
up all kind of Fiſhes,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 47.</note> whether good or bad; and to

wherein beſides the good ſeed which the Lord had
ſowen, <hi>Infelix lolium &amp; ſteriles dominantur ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi>
the enemy had ſowed his tares. And this is
thought by ſome of good note and learning to be
the chief intention of our Saviours Parable, who
tells us, that he meant not by the <hi>Sinite</hi> ſo farre to
patronize the Heretick, or protect the wicked, as to
reſpit either of them from the cenſure of the Church
or State, under pretence of calling them to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
at the general Audit; but to ſet forth the true
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:168623:145"/>
condition of the Church here militant, in which the
wicked perſon and the righteous man are ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled,
that there is no perfection to be looked
for in this preſent World:<note place="margin">Beauxamis in locum.</note> and therefore very well

here inform the Miniſter, or the Civil Magiſtrate, or
any private perſon, what they are to do, but onely
repreſents unto his Diſciples the true condition of
his Church till the end of the World; which can be
never ſo reformed and purified, but that ſome errors
and corruptions will continue in it.</p>
            <p>But whether it be ſo or not, certain it is, that ſuch
is the condition of the Church in this preſent World,
that it is ſubject to corruptions, and never abſolutely
free from ſin and error. There is much droſſe amongſt
her gold;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12.</note> and although that her foundations be of
precious ſtones, yet there is wood and hay, and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the ſuperſtructure; which are ſo intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
&amp; made up together, that nothing but a general
fire can exactly part them, I mean the fire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration,
not of Popiſh Purgatory. Were it not
thus, we need not pray for the Church militant, but
glory as in the triumphant. And yet the Church
is counted holy, and called Catholick ſtill, this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
notwithſtanding; Catholick in regard of
time, place and perſons, in and by which the Goſpel
of our Saviour is profeſſed and propagated: Holy,

make a rupture for poor trifles in the Body myſtical.

            <p>Therefore for further ſatisfaction to the ſtubborn

types and fortunes of it, to ſee if we can ſinde ſuch
a ſpotleſs Church as they vainly dream of. In <hi>Adams</hi>
Family, which was the firſt, both type and Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

in the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when more large and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
how many were mad upon the worſhip of the

to the Idol <hi>Moloch;</hi> thouſands that bowed the knee
to <hi>Baal;</hi> ten thouſands which did ſacrifice in the
Groves and prohibited places? yet all this while a
Church, a true viſible Church, with which the Saints
and Prophets joyned in Gods publick worſhip. Let
us next look upon the Goſpel, and we ſhall find that
when the bounds thereof were ſo ſtrait and narrow,
that there were few more viſible members of it then
the twelve Apoſtles, yet amongſt them there was
a <hi>Judas</hi> which betrayed his Maſter. When it began
to ſpread and inlarge it ſelf to the number of one
hundred and twenty, there were among them ſome

and reſpites them ſometimes from the hand of

perſons ſake amongſt whom they dwell. The
Lord,<note place="margin">Gen. 30. 27.</note> we know, bleſſed <hi>Laban</hi> for the ſake of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
and proſpered the whole houſe of <hi>Potiphar,</hi> out of the

               <note place="margin">39. 5.</note> If <hi>Sodom</hi> ſtood ſo long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed,

ſtood to this very day, but certainly have ſcaped that

Lord our God to ſlay the righteous with the wicked,
the Judge of all the World is more juſt then ſo.
When God rains vengeance from above on the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of the common miſeries which do befall the

they do, it is becauſe that even the beſt men have

foul ſins which God thinks fit to expiate with a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Purgatory.</p>
            <pb n="273" facs="tcp:168623:148"/>
            <p>Now as the righteous do this ſervice to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, in reference unto his temporal conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
ſo he receives in lieu thereof a farre greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
in reference to his own ſpiritual converſation:
For firſt, the filthy lives of ungodly perſons are as a

               <hi>Permixti bonis mali ſunt, ut eorum compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione

Juſt ſo the <hi>Spartans</hi> uſed to ſhew their drunken
ſlaves to their Sonnes and Nephews, that they might
bring them to a loathing of that beaſtly vice. And
then they make them farre more careful of their
lives and actions, yea of their words and ſpeeches
alſo: <hi>David</hi> reſolved, and 'twas a neceſſary reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
if you mark it well, to ſet a bridle on his
mouth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.</note> for fear of offending with his Tongue; but
it was only for <hi>quamdiu, quamdiu impius in conſpectu,</hi>
as long as the ungodly was in his ſight, who hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto his diſcourſes, as the Jewes did unto our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours,
only of purpoſe to betray him. And this
was it which made the Primitive Chriſtians ſo ſevere

               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:168623:149"/>
by which the Saints have opportunity to manifeſt
their faith in Gods gracious promiſes, and to ſet
forth their patience in the time of trouble. The <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
had never cryed ſo fervently to the Lord

<hi>Eſt aliquod bonum propter vicinum malum,</hi>
There comes much good aſſuredly from an evill
neighbour. In each of theſe reſpects, or in all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the Lord permits the wicked man to live and

            <p>Theſe words contain the full and finall reſolution
of the heavenly Husbandman, in the diſpoſing of the
Tares, ſo much, ſo earneſtly complained of. In which
we muſt behold him in the quality of a Judge or
Magiſtrate, pronouncing his determinate ſentence
in an open Court, upon the pleadings and debate of
the point before him. And here we have two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
parts to be conſidered, the Judgement and the
Executioners: The Executioners, the Miniſters ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Court, are the Heavenly Angels (though
here repreſented to us by the name of Reapers) to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:168623:151"/>
whom it appertaineth to bring forth the Priſoners,
and to ſee juſtice done upon them in the form pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.

<hi>Colligite, colligate, comburite:</hi> Gather them
firſt, for they ſhall be no longer ſuffered in the field
of God. 2. Binde them, and binde them in the
chains of eternal darkneſs, to let them know there
is no hope, no poſſibility to eſcape their puniſhment.
3. And having bound, then caſt them preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the everlaſting flames, to fire unquenchable. This
is the Judgement of the Tares, of the wicked man.
In that which doth concern the Wheat, we have

of the Court, the Angels: <hi>And in the time of

that's the firſt.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">Patercul. hiſt. <hi>l.</hi> 2.</note> The

whether it is in point of Counſel or of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
And he that is well ſtudied in the art of men,
will ſo imploy his Miniſters and their abilities, as
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:168623:152"/>
may be fitteſt to advance the buſineſs which he hath
in hand. Every mans Talent lieth not in the Camp
or Senate; ſome are for the Miniſterial or more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
Offices, but yet as uſeful to the publick in
their ſeveral places, though not ſo honourable in
themſelves; and theſe too have their proper and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Activities, beyond the bounds whereof if
they be commanded, they become dull and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh,
and unprofitable, and rather do incumber then
promote the ſervice. Thus it is alſo in the Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the Heavenly Husbandman; The Lord hath
ſeveral ſorts of Miniſters, ſome for cultivating and
manuring of his holy Field, others for bringing in
the harveſt: That the imployment of the Prelates and
inferior Clergy; this of the holy Angels, of the Hoſts
of Heaven; <hi>Meſſores autem Angeli ſunt,</hi> the Reapers
are the Angels, <hi>v.</hi> 39. And 'tis an excellent Rule
which St. <hi>Hierome</hi> gives us in this buſineſs, <hi>Quae expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſita
ſunt à Domino his debeo accommodare fidem,</hi>
That in thoſe things which are expounded by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>in</hi> Mat. c. 13.</note>
it were abſurd to look for any clearer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary.
Which makes me wonder by the
way, that <hi>Hierome</hi> ſhould ſo eaſily forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his own good rule, as to expound the
Servants of the 27. of the Angels alſo. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
the Servants of the 27. with whom
the Maſter doth diſcourſe throughout this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
muſt needs be different from the Reapers of
this preſent Text, of whom he ſpeaks unto thoſe
Servants, as diſtinct Miniſters deſigned to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Offices.</p>
            <p>So then the Reapers are the Angels, there's no
doubt of that. And they we know are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:168623:152"/>
miniſtring ſpirits, ſaith the Scripture,
imployed by God, as often as he ſees occaſion, in
his affaires of greateſt moment; in none more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
then ſuch as do relate to the Sonnes of men,
either in point of puniſhment or preſervation. We
told you not long ſince of a double Harveſt, within
the compaſſe and intention of the preſent verſe; an
Harveſt of Gods temporal judgements upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
men and Nations, and collective bodies: an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
of Gods general judgement, when all fleſh ſhall
appear before him to receive their ſentence. And in
both theſe the Angels are the Miniſters of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Court; the ordinary Officers or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of
the Almighty Judge, and bound to execute the
mandates which are iſſued thence, whether mens
ſins be ripe for vengeance, or that affliction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
make them fit for mercy. Firſt, in the
wayes of temporal puniſhment, it is moſt clear and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
in holy Scripture,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. v. 13.</note> that God ſent down his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
with a full Commiſſion to deſtroy <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrah,</hi> two rich populous Cities, after they had ſo
long abuſed his patience, and their own proſperities;
and that he ſent his evil Angels amongſt the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 78. 49, 50.</note>
when neither ſignes nor wonders could prevail
upon them; by whom he gave their life over to the
Peſtilence, ſlew the firſt-born in all their dwellings,
and finally overwhelmed them in the red Sea. Where
note,<note place="margin">Bellar. &amp; Lorin: <hi>in Pſ.</hi> 77.</note> that they are there called <hi>mali angeli,</hi> or evill
Angels, not that they were ſo in themſelves, but <hi>ab
effectu,</hi> by reaſon of the ſeveral evils which they did
inflict on that periſhing and wretched people, by the
Lords appointment. Thus do we alſo read of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
Angel, by whom, according to the Word
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:168623:153"/>
and Command of God, no fewer then 7000. of the
Jewes were conſumed in an inſtant, when once they
boaſted in their numbers, and did preſume too farre
in the arm of fleſh:<note place="margin">2 King. 19. v. 35.</note> and of another which went out
and ſmote in the Camp of the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> no leſſe then
185000. men, after they had blaſphemed the Lord,
and put a ſcorn upon the holy one of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> not to
ſay any thing of <hi>Herod,</hi> who when he had beheaded
<hi>James,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 12. 2, 3. 23.</note> impriſoned <hi>Peter,</hi> and troubled certain of the
Church, was miſerably ſmitten by an Angel, and
conſumed by worms. It pleaſed God to imploy them
in theſe acts of vengeance, though well affected in
themſelves to the good of mankind; and a neceſſity
was layd upon them to obey his pleaſure. <hi>Nec quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
est in Angelis niſi parendi neceſsitas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">l. 2. c. 17.</note> ſaid
<hi>Lactantius</hi> truly.</p>
            <p>So farre the point is clear from the Book of God;
and if we will believe the Learned (as I think we
may) there is no ſignall puniſhment of ungodly
people aſcribed to God in holy Scripture but what
was executed by the Miniſtry of theſe bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
except ſome other meanes and Miniſters be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
named. That great and univerſall deluge in
the time of <hi>Noah</hi> was queſtionleſs the work of God;
<hi>Behold I,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6. v. 17.</note> 
               <hi>even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
Earth:</hi> But this was done <hi>Miniſterio Angelorum,</hi>
by the Miniſtry and ſervice of the holy Angels, whom
God employed in breaking up the Fountain of the
great deep, and opening the Cataracts of Heaven,
for the deſtruction of that wicked unrepenting
people.<note place="margin">v. 24, 27.</note> Thus when it is affirmed in the 14. of <hi>Exod.
That the Lord looked into the Hoſt of the Egyptians

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Toſtat.</hi> in Exod. 14.</note> we muſt not underſtand it of
the Lord himſelf, but only of the Angel, or that
miniſtring ſpirit, of whoſe being in the Cloud we had
heard before. And when we read, that in the Battel
of the five Kings againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the Lord caſt
down great ſtones from Heaven upon them, in the
10. of <hi>Joſuah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id.</hi> in Joſ. 10. qu. 8.</note> it is not to be thought, as <hi>Tostatus</hi>
notes it, <hi>quòd Deus mitteret, ſed Angeli jubente Deo,</hi>
that this was done by Gods own hand, but by the
holy Angels at the Lords appointment. The like
may be obſerved of thoſe other acts of power and
puniſhment, whereof we find ſuch frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the holy Scripture, that though they be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to God as the principal agent, yet were they
generally effected by his heavenly Angels, as the
meanes and inſtrument.</p>
            <p>But the moſt proper office of the holy Angels is
not for puniſhment, but preſervation; not for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the wicked, but for the protection of the
juſt and righteous; not for the rooting up of the
Tares, but for the ſafety of the Wheat; <hi>for they
are miniſtring Spirits</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>ſent out to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
unto them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">H. b. 1. v. 14.</note> That's
the chief part of their imployment, the buſineſſe
which they moſt delight in; and God accordingly
both hath and doth employ them from time to time.
For, by the Miniſtry of his Angels did he deliver
<hi>Iſhmael</hi> from the extremities of thirſt, and <hi>Daniel</hi>

            <p>This was Gods way of preſervation in the times
before us; and for his way of preſervation in all Ages
ſince, God is the ſame God now as then, his holy
Angels no leſſe diligent in their attendance on our
perſons, then they have been formerly. Let us but
make our ſelves by our faith and piety worthy to be
accounted the Sonnes of God, and the Heires of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and doubt we not of the aſſiſtance of thoſe
miniſtring Spirits in all the times of perſonal or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
dangers. It's true, the apparition of the
Angels in theſe latter times hath been very rare, and
God dealt very graciouſly with the ſonnes of men,
that they come ſo ſeldom; for, being too many are
ſo prone to give divine honours to the Images of the
Saints departed, how eaſily might they deceive
themſelves of their reward in a voluntary humility
and worſhipping of Angels (which was the fault of
the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi>

though theſe temporal judgements and deliverances
may come within the compaſs of the Harveſt which

of the general Judgement, when all fleſh ſhall be

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of that
dreadful Court. For proof whereof, we need but look
into the proceſs of St. <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpel,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. v. 30.</note> in which we
find, <hi>That the Lord ſhall come to judgement, riding on
the Clouds with great power and glory,</hi> accompanied
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:168623:155"/>
with Angels and Archangels, and the ſound of the
Trumpet. So great a Judge coming to hold his grand
Aſſiſes, cannot be uſhered in with leſſe Pomp and
Majeſty. And to what purpoſe ſerve thoſe Angels?
Aſſuredly, not only to fill up the Train, to make the
manner of his coming the more brave and glorious,
but for ſome other ſpecial and more weighty uſe. And
therefore when our Saviour hath informed us this,
<hi>That the Sonne of man ſhall come in his glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15. v. 30.</note> 
               <hi>and all
the holy Angels with him;</hi> he tells us in the following
words, <hi>That before him ſhall all the Nations of the
World be gathered.</hi> Gathered together, but by whom?
by theſe very Angels. <hi>Then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall he ſend

ſhall gather together the Elect from the four winds, from
one end of Heaven unto the other.</hi> What the Elect, and
none but they? Not ſo. Theſe Reapers muſt root
up the Tares as well as gather in the Wheat. Our
Saviours Expoſition of the Text makes that clear
enough, where we ſhall find, that at the end of the
world, <hi>the Sonne of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels,
and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdom all things that
offend,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 40. &amp;c.</note>

Husbandman, as he is repreſented to us in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Parable, worthy of our applauſe and imitation:
His goodneſs firſt, <hi>Seminando bona,</hi> in that he ſowed
his field with the good ſeed only; his patience next,
<hi>tolerando mala,</hi> in ſuffering the Tares, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a corrupt and adulterate ſeed, to remain unga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
till the Harveſt came. In the next place, we
have his wiſdom, <hi>praecavendo pericula,</hi> in taking ſuch
eſpecial care to preſerve his Wheat, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
had been ſubject to ſome notable miſchief, had
he imbraced the other which his Servants made, the
<hi>imus &amp; colligimus</hi> of the 28. And laſt of all, we have
his juſtice, <hi>reddendo ſecundum merita,</hi> in giving unto
every one as he had deſerved, according to the works
which he hath wrought in the fleſh, whether good or
bad. <hi>Praemium &amp; Poena,</hi> Reward and puniſhment
have in all Ages been eſteemed the Rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
not only of all Earthly Governments, but the
Heavenly alſo. Who would endeavour piety and the
works of vertue, were there not ſome reward to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
him to it? or rob his Genius of the dalliances of
this preſent life, and not give way unto the ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his luſts and Appetite, were there not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in ſtore to affright him from it; were not the
puniſhments ſo grievous, and of ſuch eternity, as farre
ſurmount the ſweetneſs of theſe ſinful pleaſures,
which in themſelves are ſhort and momentany, and
enjoyed only for a ſeaſon? The fear of puniſhment
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:168623:156"/>
and Hell are of greateſt efficacy to affright many a
man from ſin, (whom the love of God and godlineſſe
will hardly work on;) and well it were if the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of it would prevail ſo farre.</p>
            <p>Of this, the condemnation of the wicked, I am firſt
to ſpeak, the method of my Text doth invite me to
it; and the firſt word we meet with is <hi>Colligite, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye together,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Greek Text hath
it; and that doth ſignifie ſuch a kind of gathering
as intimates a plucking up by the roots withall.
We had it in this ſenſe in the former verſe, where
the Servants having made an offer to go and gather
up the Tares, were abſolutely refuſed, on this reaſon
chiefly,<note place="margin">ver. 29.</note> 
               <hi>ne fortè colligentes zizania, leſt while ye ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up the Tares, ye root up the Wheat.</hi> Certainly, had
the Tares been gathered, either by pulling off the
eares, as the Apoſtles did the Corn on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;
or breaking off the ſtalk in the very midſt (each
of which wayes they might have gone) they might
have gathered in the Tares, and not hurt the Wheat,
at leaſt as to the rooting up, the totall eradication of
it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> then is not to gather only, but to gather
up; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to gather up the Tares by
the very roots; which ſhewes the deſperate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs
condition of the wicked man, if once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over unto condemnation; for where there is
a gathering or a rooting up, there is no hope that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it ſhall grow again: weeds which are only mowed
may ſpring up again; and Tares that have their eares
pulled off, and no more then ſo, cumber the ground
at leaſt, if they do not worſe; they have ſtill place
and footing in the Field of God, and take up ſo much
room therein, that they permit not Gods Seed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:168623:157"/>
large and ſpread it ſelf, and yield ſuch fair increaſe
to the Heavenly Husbandman as it would do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
but if they once be gathered up, or pulled up
by the Roots, which comes all to one, they are then
paſt growing any more; they ſhall be able from
thenceforth to do no more hurt, or work unto the
Wheat any further dammage.</p>
            <p>But then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is withall a compound word, and
doth not only ſignifie a gathering up, but a gathering
up of all together: <hi>Gather ye the Tares together,</hi> ſo
the Engliſh. All of them, not a Tare excepted; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Heretick nor the Schiſmatick, the formall,
nor the falſe Profeſſor; neither the counterfeit not
the falſe-faced Proteſtant, the open nor the ſecret
ſinner, ſhall eſcape the gathering. Though they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Rocks to fall upon them, and the hills to
hide them, yet ſhall theſe Reapers find them out, and
gather them from every corner of the Earth, be they
where they will. And we may ſay of them, as <hi>Moſes</hi>
of the Herds and Cattel of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael, ne
ungulam eſſe relinquendam,</hi> that not an hoof of all
theſe unclean beaſts ſhall be left behind. Though
they have flattered their poor ſouls, and ſaid, Tuſh,
God will not ſee it; or have diſguiſed themſelves
with fig leaves, out of a ſilly hope to conceal their
nakedneſs; or wiped their lips ſo cunningly, with the
Harlot in the Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> that no men can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
a ſtolen kiſſe upon them, yet all this will not
ſerve the turn: God for all this will bring them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one to judgement, and apprehend them by his
Angels, the Miniſters of the mighty Judge, when
they go a gathering. There ſhall not one of them
eſcape the hands of theſe diligent Serjeants, <hi>ne u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:168623:157"/>
quidem,</hi> not ſo much as one. It is <hi>colligite</hi> in the
Text, a gathering up of all together. And yet this
is not all contained in this gathering neither; it is a
gathering in which implies a ſevering, or a ſeparation,
and then it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, gather them
up, that is to ſay, ſever them, ſet them by themſelves
to receive their ſentence.<note place="margin">v. 49.</note> For in the following Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of the caſting-Net, the gathering of every kind
of fiſh had a ſevering with it. The Angels ſhall come
forth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and ſhall ſever the wicked from
the juſt. And in that of the Sheep and of the Goats,
in the 25.<note place="margin">v. 31.</note> the gathering of all Nations before the
Lord, brings in a ſeparation, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of the one
from the other.</p>
            <p>So then <hi>Colligite</hi> in this place muſt be <hi>ſeparate,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them from the Wheat, from the Lords good
grain, that their impieties and iniquities may appear
more evidently; and ſeparate them from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Lord their God, of whoſe moſt bleſſed
viſion they deſerve not to be made partakers. Firſt,
ſever, or part them from the Wheat, let them ſtand
alone. Though in this World the Lord doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſpare the wicked and ungodly man,<note place="margin">Stapleton.</note> 
               <hi>propter prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiam
juſtorum,</hi> as my Authour hath it, out of his
love to the Elect; or in <hi>profectum humanae ſalutis,</hi> for
the ſalvation of his Saints,<note place="margin">Hilarius.</note> to whom they ſerve for an
increaſe both of faith and patience, as we read in
<hi>Hilary;</hi> yet in the day of judgement they ſhall find
it otherwiſe. In that day they ſhall neither be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of Gods bleſſings with them, nor receive any
benefit or protection by them; and much leſſe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
any of their Oyl to trim their Lamps, or enter
with the Bridegroom by that borrowed light. The
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:168623:158"/>
ungodly ſhall not then ſtand in the judgement with
them,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 5.</note> nor ſinners in that Congregation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
as the Pſalmiſt hath it. And next, they ſhall
be ſeparated from the preſence of the Lord their
God, of whoſe moſt bleſſed and beatifical viſion they
deſerve not to be made partakers; for being ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the juſt, and ſtanding before God in their
own uncleanneſs, without the light of faith, and the
robes of charity, there followeth a <hi>Diſcedite à me,
Depart from me ye curſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gorran. in locum.</note> 
               <hi>get you farre from hence.</hi>
And this is <hi>dira &amp; infelix diſceſsio,</hi> a miſerable and
moſt wretched caſe, in caſe it went no further then a
<hi>poena damni,</hi> a loſſe of thoſe inſeparable comforts
which do ariſe unto the Saints upon the ſight of God.
<hi>Diſcedite à me, Depart from me:</hi> O the moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſentence of a moſt juſt Judge, which neither the
guilty can eſcape, nor the condemned man withſtand;
againſt which no ſinner can except, &amp; from which the
damned cannot appeal! Depart from thee! why, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall we go, O God, being driven from thee?
whither, but from the Paradiſe of glories to a
world of ſhame, from the Father of lights unto ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
darkneſs, from the fulneſs of joy to howling
and perpetual lamentation, from pleaſures unto
weeping and gnaſhing of teeth?</p>
            <p>The gathering being finiſhed, next comes in the
binding: It is <hi>Colligite</hi> firſt, and <hi>Colligite primùm,</hi>
before we come to <hi>alligate;</hi> Firſt gather, and then
binde them faſt. I know that ſome Interpreters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
this <hi>primum</hi> to the order of the ſeveral judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
firſt, gather up the Tares, then bring in the
Wheat. But this doth ill agree with our Saviours
method uſed in other places; for in the Parable of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:168623:158"/>
the Net caſt into the Sea, the good fiſh were firſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
into Veſſels,<note place="margin">v. 48.</note> before the bad were thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:

               <hi>Venite</hi> hath precedence of <hi>diſcedite;</hi> the

Texts of Scripture, where it is ſaid, not only in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
of the twelve Apoſtles, <hi>that they ſhall ſit on twelve
Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael;</hi> but alſo
of the Saints in generall,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. v. 2: <hi>Eſtius in</hi> 1 Cor. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Do ye not know that the
Saints ſhall judge the World?</hi> and that not only <hi>ſola
comparatione,</hi> by upbraiding their impieties and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencies,
in which reſpect the <hi>Ninevites</hi> and the
Queen of the South are in the Goſpel ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Jewes; but <hi>approbatione divinae ſententiae,</hi>
by approving and applauding that moſt righteous
judgement which Chriſt the ſupreme Judge ſhall
pronounce againſt them: which could not be, in caſe
the wicked did receive their finall ſentence before
the righteous were admitted into ſome participation
of the heavenly glories. The gathering of the Tares
is here firſt propounded, not becauſe firſt in order of
the ſeveral judgements, but becauſe they gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
unto this diſcourſe betwixt the heavenly Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
and his houſhold-Servants, for no other
reaſon. <hi>Colligite primum,</hi> firſt gather, in that ſenſe, but
in no ſenſe elſe; <hi>alligate</hi> next.</p>
            <pb n="294" facs="tcp:168623:159"/>
            <p>Firſt gather, and then bind. And binding is a
terme derived or borrowed from the Courts of
ſecular Judges, according to the courſe whereof the
condemned Priſoners are led bound to their executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſo to prevent all hope and poſſibility of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,
and make them yield unto their puniſhment
with the leſſe reſiſtance. <hi>I Lictor, liga manus, verberato,
infeliciarbori ſuſpendito:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Livius paſsim.</note> Here <hi>Lictor,</hi> binde the
Priſoner, ſcourge him, or hang him on the Gallow-Tree,
as the ſentence varied. But whether <hi>verberato,</hi>
or <hi>ſuſpendito,</hi> there was ſtill <hi>Liga manus,</hi> as a part of
the puniſhment. Thus when the great Tyrant <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>
had condemned the three Hebrew
Children to the fiery Furnace,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> he firſt commanded
them to be bound, and then to be caſt in the midſt
of the flames. And when the Prieſts and Phariſees
had voted our Redeemer to be guilty of death, they
led him bound to <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> (<hi>vinctum adduxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi>
ſaith the Text) to have their bloody ſentence
put in execution. This binding of the wicked after
condemnation is the firſt <hi>poena ſenſus,</hi> the firſt part
of the ſenſible torments which they are damned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by the righteous Judge: and a great aggravation
of their torments 'tis, if you mark it well; it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all hope and poſſibility of eſcape, as before was
ſaid; letting them ſee, that how intolerable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
ſoever their damnation be, they muſt endure
it to the utmoſt, there's no after-remedy. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>alligate ut non poſsint evadere,</hi> ſaith my Author
well.<note place="margin">Gorran.</note> The Chains in which they are here bound are
everlaſting Chains, <hi>aeterna vincula,</hi> as St. <hi>Jude</hi> calls
them: and therefore they which are thus bound, are
bound for aye and everlaſtingly, without expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:168623:159"/>
on of releaſe. There is no ſaying in this caſe, <hi>rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pamus
vincula,</hi> let us break their bonds in ſunder,
and caſt their cords from us;<note place="margin">Pſal. 2, 3.</note> they are <hi>aeterna vincula,</hi>
everlaſting theſe.</p>
            <p>Next, it deprives them of all eaſe, of all meanes
and help, of leſſening any part of thoſe terrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which the moſt righteous Judge hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on them. It is a great refreſhing unto one that
languiſheth under the rage and tyranny of a burning
Feaver, that he can ſometimes ſhift his ſide, and
tumble from one part of the bed to another; no
ſmall comfort to a Priſoner, if he have liberty to walk
or ſtir up and down, in the midſt of all the torments
which are laid upon them: But they which are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
in the flames of Hell, and laid up in that
dreadful Dungeon, have not the liberty to move, and
to change their places, further then as it ſhall ſeem
good unto their tormentors, for the multiplication
and increaſe of their pains and miſeries. And this
we may be ſure of alſo, that the greater Libertines we
are here, the more licentiouſly we live in this preſent
world, the greater ſhall our thraldom be, the more
ſtrict our bonds, in the eſtate of condemnation in the
world to come. Too many which profeſs the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
have been looſly given, addicted unto all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs
and laſciviouſneſs; and therefore <hi>alligate,</hi>
binde them, make them faſt enough. A binding to
the good behaviour to the purpoſe this: others have
had their feet ſwift to ſhed innocent blood,
and lifted up rebellious hands againſt Gods anointed.
<hi>I Lictor, lig a manus,</hi> Hold Satan, take him hence,
binde him hands and feet, in the eternal chains of
darkneſs, never to ſtir a foot in the way of peace, or
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:168623:160"/>
lift up a repenting hand to the God of mercy; never
to be reſtored to liberty, nor releaſed from miſery:
the Fable of <hi>Prometheus</hi> being bound in the mountain
<hi>Caucaſus</hi> for a perpetual prey to devouring Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
hath ſome reſemblance unto this: but that
was but a Fable, this a moſt ſad truth; never
were known ſuch bonds as theſe, ſuch a binding
never.</p>
            <p>And yet the binding is the worſe, and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
greater, in regard they are not ſeverally bound,
every one by himſelf in his own Irons, but <hi>in faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciculos,</hi>
in bundles, every man with his fellows and
Aſſociates which were guilty of the ſame ſin with
him; that ſin I mean which either was moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
in the ſight of God, or moſt predominant in
the heart of the ſinful man. It is not <hi>alligate</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
but <hi>alligate in faſciculos,</hi> binde them in bundles,
ſo the Engliſh; or into Fagots rather, as the words
do ſignifie; and Fagots are the fitteſt fewel for the
fire of Hell. This ſhewes that God doth puniſh ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in the world to come, <hi>non ſecundum ſtatum

according to the nature of their ſeveral crimes,<note place="margin">Stapleton.</note> not of

               <note place="margin">Lucan.</note> ſaid the Poet rightly:
The Murderers, and ſuch as kill without the Sword
of Authority, ſhall make one Fagot, the ſecret and
the open Traytors another; the Adulterers and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſes
ſhall make one Fagot, and the Fornicators
another; the Hereticks ſhall make up one Fagot,
the Schiſmaticks and Sectaries ſhall be bound up in
another; the Idolaters ſhall make one Fagot, they
that commit ſacriledge to pull down Idolatry, ſhall
make up another; the Glutton, whoſe belly is his
God, ſhall make one Fagot, the Drunkard whoſe
glory is his ſhame, another: The Thief, that knowes
no other Trade to maintain himſelf but by undoing
of his Neighbour; the cunning Hypocrite, who
makes a gain of godlineſs, and puts his Religion unto
uſury; and they who baſely and perfidiouſly invert
the publick money to their private profit, ſhall each
make up their ſeveral Fagots. <hi>Pares cum paribus,</hi>
ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> every man ſhall be puniſhed in the
world to come, according to the ſin which he hath
committed, and in the company of thoſe with whom
he hath moſt offended. And though it be an old ſaid
Saw, <hi>Solamen miſeris,</hi> that it is a comfort to thoſe in
miſery to have others bear a ſhare in their griefs and
ſorrows, (a miſerable comfort at the beſt, there's
no doubt of that;) yet it is nothing ſo in the preſent
caſe; for of that nature are the puniſhments which
attend this binding, that the pains thereof are nothing
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:168623:161"/>
leſſened by being communicated, but are then mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied

comes after next? <hi>Ad comburendum,</hi> ſaith the Text,
binde them in bundles for to burn them. And here
the caſe is ſomewhat altered, as it relates unto the

And yet unto this miſerable and calamitous

            <p>
               <hi>Congregate,</hi> that's the action here, and the firſt
word to be conſidered, which though our Engliſh
rendreth <hi>Gather,</hi> yet is it a farre different gathering
from that which did occur before. Before it was
<hi>colligite, congregate</hi> here, gather them into a Church
or a Congregation; Before it was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, pluck

               </gap>, draw
them into a Synagogue, a place of general Aſſembly.
This is the old word by which the Fathers uſed to
denote the Church of God amongſt the Jews, before
the coming of our Saviour; and that the new, by
which they many times expreſs the Church of God
amongſt us Chriſtians ſince our Saviours paſſion.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:168623:164"/>
Both of them words of Eccleſiaſtical uſe and notion,
and both do ſignifie the ſame, though in diverſe Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.
They which be true and faithful members of
the Church of God, whether it be under the Law,
or under the Goſpel, ſhall all be drawn into one Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
or Congregation in the day of the Lord; and
all, together with the holy Patriarchs before <hi>Moſes</hi>
time, ſhall make up that one glorious Church which
is entituled in the Scriptures <hi>Univerſalem Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem,</hi>
the general Aſſembly, <hi>the Church of the
first-born whoſe names are written in the Heavens.</hi>
We have the word thus uſed,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> as in other places, ſo in
the 24. of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, where it is told us of
theſe Angels, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>congregabunt

corner of the world, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they ſhall gather them
<hi>in ſacram Synaxin, in ſanctam congregationem,</hi> into an
holy Congregation, a religious Aſſembly. So that
the gathering of the Saints together in the day of
Judgement is but a Tranſlation of them from one
Church to another; or rather from that part of the
ſame one Church which is here militant on the
Earth, to that which is triumphant in the Heaven of
glories. The Saints both here and there make but
one Communion; we praiſing God for manifeſting
his great power and Grace on them, they praying
unto God to ſend his choyceſt bleſſings of grace and
mercy upon us. The difference is no more then this,
that here it is expoſed to diſgrace and ignominy; ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
&amp; age have ploughed deep wrinkles on her face;
too many ſpots there are in her feaſts of charity; and
ſometimes ſhe takes cold in her affections, like the
Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſtarting aſide from her Redeemer
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:168623:165"/>
like a broken bow;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> but there ſhall Chriſt preſent her
to himſelf a moſt <hi>glorious Church without ſpot or

we have Tares amongſt the Wheat, more Tares per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
then Wheat in too many places; but there
ſhall be no place in Heaven but for Wheat alone; no
unclean thing ſhall enter into the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> no
Tares into the Barn of the heavenly Husbandman;
that was provided for the Wheat only, and for none
but that.</p>
            <p>For ſo it followeth in the Text, <hi>Congregate triticum
in horreum meum,</hi> Gather the Wheat into my Barn,
the place deſigned by all good Husbands for the
diſpoſing of the Wheat, their beſt ſort of grain. Not
in a Barn, according to the literal ſenſe, (we ſhall have
too many Congregations held in Barns, if this world
go on) but according to the myſtical meaning. In

by thoſe Husbandmen to whom the Lord

Here is a joy, a perfect everlaſting joy, made ready

of our ſelves that riſe up continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whoſe lips ſpeak proud words, and pervert good
meanings, that ſo they may be followed and cryed
up, and draw away much people after them. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
foreſaw this miſchief, and forewarns us of it; and of

the ſame with a <hi>vigilate, Watch therefore, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

Wolves, grievous Wolves were entring in, and ſuch
as would not ſpare the Flock; that follows cloſe on

a rupture in the Church, <hi>and draw away Diſciples after
them;</hi> that goes immediately before the <hi>Vigilate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Attendite &amp; vigilate</hi> are two good Caveats, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
here by the Apoſtle in the name of Chriſt, that
ſo he might preſerve that intereſt in the Church of
God, which he had purchaſed to himſelf with his
own dear blood. In one of theſe he arms his Prelates
<hi>contra ſaevitiam perſecutorum,</hi> againſt the fury of the
perſecutors, which aſſault without; and in the other
he prepares them <hi>contra fraudulentiam deceptorum,</hi>
againſt the fraud of the perverters; and other ſecret
ſickneſſes which infect within. In both he layes before
them the Churches dangers, that ſo they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
themſelves of convenient remedies.</p>
            <p>As for the words now read unto you we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
in them theſe two generals; the ſickneſs of the
Church, and the cure thereof. The ſickneſs is a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or a riſing up of certain ill-affected humours in
the body myſtical: which we ſhall firſt conſider in
the thing it ſelf, <hi>Exurgent viri,</hi> then ſhall men ariſe.
Secondly, in the <hi>unde,</hi> from what part or place, <hi>Ex
vobis ipſis,</hi> from our ſelves. Thirdly, in the effect,
what they do being riſen; <hi>loquuntur perverſa,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perverſe things: And laſtly, what it is they aim
at; <hi>ut abducant diſcipulos poſt ſe,</hi> to draw away Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
after them. In the next general, the Cure, we
have theſe particulars: 1. The Phyſician, that's the
Prelate, to whom the charge promiſed is given.
And 2. The Medicine here preſcribed, which is the
care and vigilancy of the Prelates, <hi>Vigilate igitur,
Watch therefore.</hi> Of theſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="313" facs="tcp:168623:168"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Exurgent viri,</hi> that's the firſt. And ſure it might
be well ſuppoſed, comparing theſe two dangers with
one another, that the poor Church were in no mean
degree of ſafety, having eſcaped thoſe grievous
Wolves, to fall into the hands of men; for <hi>homo
homini fit Deus,</hi> as the Proverb hath it. But, if conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as it ought, the danger is no leſſe then before it
was; for <hi>homo homini fit lupus,</hi> is a Proverb too. There
we had men who for their rage and cruelty were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
Wolves; here Wolves, who for their ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
gentleneſs and humanity are entituled men.
But here and there their purpoſe is the ſame to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Church; there openly by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
here ſecretly by fraud and cunning: and
therefore here the danger greater, becauſe leſſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
as undermining is more dangerous to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguered
Cities then an open battery. As long as
Satan had no other inſtruments to ſubvert the
Church then thoſe grievous Wolves, he took great
pains to loſe his labour: The Tyrants all from
<hi>Nero</hi> down to <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> when they made havock
of the faithful, what did they but confirm them in
their reſolutions, and increaſe their numbers? <hi>Nec
quicquam proficit exquiſitior crudelitas veſtra, illecebra
ſectae eſt,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath it. The Hereticks all
from <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to <hi>Priſcillian,</hi> the laſt that ſtands
upon the Regiſter in St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Catalogue, when
they did openly aſſault the faith it ſelf, and ſtruck at
the foundations of it, what did they but occaſion
only that the faith became the better ſetled, and that
all thoſe which were approved were made more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt?
In which regard that of <hi>Euagrius</hi> is moſt true,
that from thoſe very men and matters which made
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:168623:169"/>
ſo many ruptures in the Church of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
by thoſe the Doctrine of the
Church was confirmed and ſetled.</p>
            <p>This when the Devil had perceived, he called in
his Wolves, and exerciſed the Church no more with
Hereſies and perſecutions: He found it more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to make uſe of men, who knew how to time it,
to watch their opportunities, and eſpy advantages;
and ſo with more aſſurance might effect his purpoſe,
becauſe leſſe ſuſpected. The Serpent never had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled

nor had the <hi>Syren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> captivated and bewitched ſo many
paſſengers, had they not had the face of Women;
<hi>Virginei vultus, &amp; vox humana remanſit,</hi> as the Poet
hath it. Of all the inſtruments of miſchief which
the world hath bred, there's none like man, the
Maſter workman, whoſe winding wit, and ſubtile
reaches make him moſt fit for all imployments.
<hi>Xerxes,</hi> when as with all his forces, his moſt numerous
forces, he could not force an entry through the walls
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> met with a man, <hi>Zopyrus,</hi> by whoſe craft
and cunning he found the gates ſet open to him;
which made him oftentimes affirm, <hi>malle ſe Zopyrum
integrum quàm viginti Babylonas,</hi> that he preferred
<hi>Zopyrus</hi> before twenty <hi>Babylons.</hi> No battery doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
ſo forcibly, nor mine work ſo ſurely, as the wit
of man; which if it be once ſet on miſchief, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
moſt miſchievous. Our Saviour Chriſt, when he
was led by Satan into the Wilderneſs, found neither
Bear nor Wolf, nor Lion, that durſt ſet upon him;
but when he came into the open Country, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
with men, then was he aſſaulted on the one
ſide by the Scribes and Phariſees, and on the other
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:168623:169"/>
ſide by the <hi>Herodians,</hi> all of them lying in wait how
they might betray him. And therefore when he ſent
out his Diſciples, he arms them with this wholſom
Caveat, <hi>Cavete ita<expan>

<hi>Ab ipſis potiùs hominibus quam à feris timendum,</hi> as
<hi>Beza</hi> gloſſeth on the place.</p>
            <p>And yet there is no fear of men, if they would be
quiet; the danger is not in the men, but in their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
it is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that works all the trouble.
And indeed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in this place is an active word,
or <hi>verbum operativum,</hi> as the Lawyers call it. This
aggravates the Churches dangers; for when the
Wolves came in, they came in with <hi>intrabunt,</hi> at the
common entrance: The whole Church ſaw it, and
obſerved it, and knew how to trace them; but for
theſe riſings, it is hard to ſay whence they take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
or to what they tend, or who it is that doth
ſupport them. When <hi>Jupiter</hi> had transformed his
<hi>Io</hi> into an Heifer, and was demanded whence ſhe
came; the crafty God returned this anſwer, that ſhe
did riſe immediately from the very earth; <hi>ut autor
deſinat inquiri,</hi> that ſo there might no further ſearch
be made of what herd ſhe was. And ſo it is in all
theſe riſings, <hi>Jupiter è terra genitam mentitur;</hi> there's
no man will confeſs from what root they came, or
own them till they grow into a body, and are made
ready for an head. And when tis come to that, tis a
riſing ſtill; a popular, ſeditious, and tumultuous ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
The word ſo uſed twice for failing in the 5th
Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

In the next verſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
After this man roſe up <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi>

               </gap>, that's the word again, in the dayes of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and drew away much people after him. Here
have we riſings, popular and ſeditious riſings; the
one againſt the civil Magiſtrate, in the point of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the other againſt the peace and polity of the
Church in matters which concern Religion; both
of them layd before us in that very word which my
Text makes uſe of; which ſhewes us that the riſing
mentioned in my Text is like that of <hi>Theudas,</hi> or of
<hi>Judas,</hi> a ſudden &amp; tumultuous riſing of unquiet men.</p>
            <p>Yet were this but a riſing ſimply, and no more
then ſo, the danger were not great, if any; for men
may ſometimes riſe and ſit down again, riſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
them of their riſing upon better thoughts; and
having ſo repented, ſet them down without more
hurt done. Such was the riſing of the holy Pilgrims
in King <hi>Henries</hi> time, who bound themſelves by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Covenant to defend Religion, although then
changing to the better; but on the firſt report of the
Kings approch disbanded and went home again; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

not look for alwayes. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of my Text, as
it doth ſignifie to riſe, ſo it doth intimate unto us
ſuch a riſing as brings deſtruction with it, and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
after it. The word ſo uſed oftentimes in the
beſt Greek Authours; as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>everſa eſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas,</hi>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to raiſe a City. Such ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
as thoſe are which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here mentioneth,
however they may hap to ſpeed, aim at the utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of that State againſt which they riſe; nor do the
riſers think themſelves in ſafety whileſt there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:168623:170"/>
to reſiſt: They never uſe to talk of peace till a
deſolation, <hi>Et ubi ſolitudinem faciunt pacem appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,</hi>
as he in <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet we do not ſee the bottom of our danger
neither; Some riſings have been eaſily ſuppreſſed by
art and wiſdom, and other ſome diſſolved by force
and power: But this is ſuch a kind of riſing, that
though it be ſuppreſt a while it will up again; and,
like <hi>Antaeus</hi> in the Poet, riſe up with greater ſtrength
then before it had, <hi>majorque accepto robore ſurgit,</hi> as
it is in <hi>Lucan.</hi> The word in the Original doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<hi>reſurgere</hi> as well as <hi>ſurgere;</hi> and then we have
an inſurrection with a reſurrection, a riſing that will
ſtill be riſing, if compoſed only for a while, or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
only for the preſent. The Church is never
ſafe in ſuch ſtorms as theſe, until it happen to theſe
riſers as unto <hi>Theudas</hi> and his followers, of whom
the Story ſaith, that both himſelf and as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

ſcattered and confounded, and brought to nothing;
<hi>Redacti ſunt ad nihilum,</hi> as the Latine hath it. And
when we once come to annihilation there's no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
            <p>You ſee here's ground enough for a <hi>Vigilate,</hi> and
that as well <hi>à parte ante,</hi> to prevent theſe riſings, as
afterwards <hi>à parte poſt,</hi> to quiet and appeaſe them
when they once are up: Both neceſſary, though the
firſt more ſafe; as commonly preventing Phyſick
ſtirs the humors leſſe, then when the ſickneſs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by ſome long delay. And yet though this be

Churches deſtiny, in that general ſpeech, <hi>inimici ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis

thoſe of his own houſe. That this hath alwayes been

thoſe who had been joyned together in the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
ſhould betray each other. So that as well
in this regard, as in that of ſin, we may take up the
ſaying and complaint of the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Perditio

of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ex vobis ipſis,</hi> from your ſelves. What, from the
Elders of the Church, the Overſeers of the flock,
ſhould men ariſe from them to pervert the people?
No queſtion but it was ſo meant by the Apoſtle; For
to the Elders, to the Overſeers, did St. <hi>Paul</hi> give
this charge, and direct this Caveat, <hi>Attendite vobis
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:168623:172"/>
ipſis &amp; univerſo gregi,</hi> Take heed unto your ſelves
and to all the flock. There have we <hi>vobis ipſis, vobis
ipſis</hi> here; which makes it manifeſt and apparent
that even from them <hi>ſhould men ariſe ſpeaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
things, to draw away much people after them.</hi> The
Elders here were Prieſts, there's no doubt of that;
Paſtors and Teachers of the people: Nor is it any
miracle that ſuch men as thoſe ſhould have their
hands or heads in thoſe publick quarrels wherewith
the Church hath been diſtracted. The firſt diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
which befel the Church was by certain men
which came down from <hi>Judaea,</hi> and taught the
people; And what did ſollow thereupon but diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and diſſentions, as the Text informs us; and
thoſe ſo great, and followed with ſuch heat and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that the Apoſtles had no ſmall adoe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the buſineſs? Our Saviour Chriſt foreſaw this
miſchief, and therefore hath repeated no one caution
more then, <hi>Cavete à Pſeudoprophetis, Beware of falſe
Prophets and of falſe Apoſtles:</hi> For they, and ſuch as
they, as they teach falſe Doctrines, ſo are they too
indulgent to their own affections, too eaſily incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to foment a party, and contribute their utmoſt
to thoſe frequent quarrels which have afflicted and
diſquieted the Church of God. Examples of which
I could ſhew you many, both in our dayes, and in the
dayes which were before us, did I conceive the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
mentioned here were but ſimply Prieſts.</p>
            <p>But ſure, (as I ſhall ſhew anon) the Elders which
aſſembled here were of an higher rank, a ſuperior
order; Biſhops, or Overſeers, call them which you
will. And ſhall we think that any of the holy Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy
could take ſo little heed unto themſelves and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:168623:172"/>
to the flock, as either openly or covertly to foment
a faction, and to hunt counter to the Church, and her
publick Ordinances; I would be very loth they
ſhould. And yet I cannot chuſe but tell you, that I
have met in my ſmall reading with ſome of them:
<hi>Meletius</hi> had his name from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Greek word
ſignifying care: but he was not <hi>Epiſcopus ſui nominis,</hi>
not a true <hi>Meletius;</hi> for he ſhewed little care of
the Churches peace, but his whole deſignes were to
increaſe his party, to draw Diſciples after him; as
dangerous for the time, but not of ſuch a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
as that of the <hi>Novatians</hi> before remembred:
<hi>Novatus</hi> had no ſooner received the <hi>Epiſcopal Order,</hi>
but preſently he ſet himſelf upon <hi>Cornelius,</hi> his chief
Biſhop, the Patriarch at the leaſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecture;
profeſſing a more rigid kind of piety then the
Church allowed of, making himſelf the head of a
<hi>Schiſmatical</hi> faction, <hi>and drawing many Diſciples after
him,</hi> not only in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf, but in <hi>Greece</hi> and
<hi>Aſia.</hi> But as <hi>Novatus</hi> was his name, ſo <hi>Innovation</hi>
was to be his buſineſs; and he plyed it well, being
the founder of the <hi>Cathari,</hi> as they (in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects)
of our Engliſh Puritans. The like may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
of <hi>Meletius</hi> alſo, an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Biſhop, raiſing a
long and tedious Schiſme againſt the Patriarch of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>
to whom the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church had
made him ſubject. The like of many of the <hi>African,</hi>
or Southern Prelates, ſo wedded to the cauſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the ancient <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> that they confined the
whole Church <hi>intra partem Donati,</hi> within the pale
and limits of the faction of theſe <hi>Donatiſts</hi> only; and
in ſome points were not unlike the Anabaptiſts of
theſe latter times, <hi>drawing ſo many Diſciples after</hi>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:168623:173"/>
them, that in the end they grew a terror to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
party. Aſſuredly the Church was moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
in theſe <hi>popular Prelates,</hi> how fortunate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they conceived themſelves in the multitude of
their Diſciples, in being countenanced and abetted
by the common people. And ſo ſhe is in thoſe who
purſue their courſes; who being placed as Overſeers
in the Church of God, do not alone neglect their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the <hi>attendite</hi> and the <hi>vigilate</hi> which are here
preſcribed, but have their part in the <hi>exurgunt,</hi> a
principal and leading part in the riſing up. Great pity
'tis that either they, or any other of the flock of
Chriſt, that ought to ſpeak peace to the Church,
ſhould riſe up againſt it; and being riſen up in ſo ſoul
a manner, ſhould ſpend their tongues and talents to
ſo lewd a purpoſe as ſpeaking perverſe things,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to draw away much people after
them, and be the leaders of a party. Yet this the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> complains of a vexatious people in his
dayes, which uſed to ſay that with their tongues they
would prevail, and that they were the men which
ought to ſpeak, without regard to any power that was
above them; <hi>Quis noſter dominus eſt?</hi> Who is Lord
over us, ſay they, or ſhall command us not to ſpeak
when opportunity is given us to advance our ſelves,
and draw away Diſciples after us? Such lawleſs
Tongues as theſe doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeak of, who
that they might be ſure to poſſeſs the people, cared
not what they ſaid, whoſe actions they traduced,
whoſe good name they ſlandered, or whoſe good
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:168623:173"/>
meaning they perverted. The word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> uſed
in the Original, doth ſignifie perverſe or froward, as

               </gap>,
<hi>in the middle of a froward and perverſe Generation.</hi>
This ſhewes us that theſe <hi>exurgentes</hi> are a perverſe
and froward people, very hard to pleaſe, and ſuch as
will take nothing in good part, how real and ſincere
ſoever: A ſullen and unſociable race of men, <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

and will not yield to reaſon, although vanquiſht

            <p>And yet this ſad and froward humour would not
hurt any but themſelves, did they keep it in; but
here is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that brings all to nought: This fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
humour muſt be vented and break wind in
ſpeech, and having broken out in ſpeech, is as full of
frowardneſs as was the ſtomach whence it came.
The perverſe humour which affects them would elſe
eat them up, and gnaw upon their entralls like <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi>
vulture. This makes them ſeek out ſuch as
are like themſelves, or eaſily inclined to give eare
unto them; to whom they powre out their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and bemoan the times, as if the Church were
like to fall, did not they ſupport it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> and they
ſo equal in their jurisdiction, that it is very hard to
ſay which of them hath the greateſt care of all the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:168623:174"/>
Churches; Hence is it that they fill the heads of
poor ignorant people with moſt groundleſs feares of
innovation in Religion, and changes in Gods publick
worſhip; the Church continually traduced, as if ſhe
were unſound in her intentions towards Chriſt; the
Prelates generally accuſed as Factors for the myſtical
ſtrumpet; and the inferior Clergy which ſubmit
themſelves to the Commands of their ſuperiors in
the Lord, what are they counted but the wretched
inſtruments to uſher in thoſe innovations which are
ſo much feared?</p>
            <p>And certainly this is <hi>perverſa loqui,</hi> in the proper
ſenſe, in the true meaning of the word; when men
are grown to ſuch a meaſure of perverſeneſs, that we
pervert the words and purpoſes of all publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and wreſt them to a meaning which they never
dreamt of. For <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to wreſt a matter from the truth, in the famous Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
A thing not ſeldom uſed by theſe perverſe
ſpeakers, who, to ſet off their projects, and promote
their cauſe, not only wreſt the words and actions of
their innocent Brethren beyond their true intent
and meaning, but too too often wreſt the Scripture,
even the moſt bleſſed Word of God, to make it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to their factious and ſeditious ends. The
Scribes and Phariſees of old, when they watched our
Saviour, ſeeking occaſion to betray him, what did
they elſe but wreſt and pervert his actions? report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he caſt out Devils by the help of Devils, that
all his miracles were forged, and his Doctrine falſe,
tending to introduce a new Religion, and annul the
old. And what, conceit you, was their aim, but to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:168623:174"/>
the people by thoſe perverſe ſpeeches, that in
a zeal unto the preſervation of Religion they might
combine together with them, unite themſelves in
ſome ſtrict Covenant againſt the Lord and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
and cry out <hi>nolumus hunc regnare</hi> with the

            <p>This is indeed the utmoſt miſchief which <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

carries with it; the word not onely ſignifying to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtort

and ſeditious artifices they augment their
numbers, and increaſe their followers, and draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Diſciples after them; which is the only thing
they aim at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To draw away Diſciples after them.</hi> This is ſtrange
indeed: Hath there been any age ſo happy in which
the people need be drawn to imbrace new fancies, to
hearken after factious riſers, and lend too credulous
an ear to their perverſe ſpeeches? I cannot tell, I
would be loth to brand all preceding times; though
in my ſlender reading I have met with none of ſo
compoſed and fine a temper, no Age wherein men
were not prone enough to hearken to perverſe and
ſeditious talkers: <hi>Sponte ſua properant,</hi> the people
commonly are too hot of their own accord to follow
after ſuch purſuits, and need little drawing. But
drawing in this place is no word of force, unleſs it be
of forcible and ſtrong perſwaſions; as when it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in Scripture, <hi>That no man commeth unto the
Sonne, except the Father pleaſe to draw: Except the
Father draw him;</hi> how? not by compelling of the
will, or forcing men to Heaven whether they will or
not; or drawing them <hi>velut inanimatum quoddam,</hi>

<hi>Luther</hi> pleaſed to phraſe it: Not ſo, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting

none but ſuch, is the preſent drawing, the drawing of
weak men by more ſubtile wits, to hearken to their

            <p>Nor do they only <hi>ducere,</hi> but they do <hi>abducere,</hi>

Texts of holy Scripture. <hi>Drawes them away?</hi>
from whence? from the main body of the Church,
the Congregation of Gods choſen. The Church is
often called in Scripture the body of Chriſt, of
which each faithful Chriſtian is a ſpeciall member.
Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
as ſaid St. <hi>Paul</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Corinth.</hi> They
therefore which withdraw a Chriſtian from the
Church of Chriſt, not only pierce his ſide, as the
Souldiers did, but teare a member from his body,
which the Souldiers durſt not. And therefore <hi>Beza</hi>
reads the word, <hi>ut abſtrahant;</hi> and gives this reaſon
why he doth ſo read it, <hi>Loquitur Luca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

profit theſe perverſe ſpeakers to draw poor people
from the Church, to make them diſaffected to the
preſent Government, and ſo give them off; what
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:168623:176"/>
ſhould they get, if any, or if every man were ſo
miſperſwaded? There's a <hi>poſt eos</hi> in the Text which
they chiefly aim at, to make men ſo leave the
Church as to follow them. Not one amongſt them
but will be a leader, and muſt have followers of his
own, ſome fair retinue to come after him, for the
greater ſtate. Such men as theſe ſtand more upon
<hi>post eos,</hi> then upon <hi>abducunt;</hi> and be their Proſelytes
what they will, noble, ignoble, rich or poor, they
muſt come behind. <hi>Post nos bonus mos,</hi> is the beſt
rule in all their Ethicks; and, <hi>primus ibi ante omnes
magna comitante caterva,</hi> accounted by them the
moſt heroick verſe in all <hi>Virgils</hi> works. The Scholar
muſt not be above his Maſter; there's no ſenſe in
that: And therefore that they may be ſure not to
loſe <hi>poſt eos,</hi> their Scholars ſhall be Scholars ſtill, ſtill
learning, like St. <hi>Paul</hi>s old women, but never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
unto the knowledge of the truth.</p>
            <p>And certainly there is good reaſon why the holy
Spirit doth not entitle thoſe which are drawn away by
the name of followers, or dependents, but by that
of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Diſciples. Men commonly reward their
followers, but they take pay of their Diſciples; and
ſomething hath ſome favour, as the ſaying is. <hi>Dignus

Apoſtle; <hi>omnia bona ſua,</hi> even all his goods, ſay theſe

while you live; A matter out of which the Phariſees
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:168623:176"/>
ſucked no ſmall advantage, becoming ſo much

and payd the fine down for them
without more adoe. Beſides, the Diſciple is obliged
to believe his Maſter; <hi>oportet diſcentem credere,</hi> as the
old rule is, and if he yield up his belief to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
dictates, his Maſter may diſpoſe of him as his
own creation. Hence is it that theſe <hi>exurgentes</hi> have
attained ſuch credit, that their words paſſe for Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
with their credulous followers: And when they
once have miſperſwaded them of their ſuperiors in
the Lord, whether Prince or Prelate, it is not in the
power of men or Angels to bring them to a right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
<hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us of the Phariſees,<note place="margin">

            <p>And now I am fallen upon the Phariſees, I ſhall
add this further, that the great pains they took in
compaſſing both Sea and Land to increaſe their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes,
and add unto the number of their dear Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
ſhewed plainly that they aimed at more then
obedient greatneſs. The power and ſway they had
with the common people had ſo farre inabled them,

and promote their friends; that happy was the

this, they would have Kings and Princes ſtand at

their devotion, and be directed by them in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
both of Church and State, or elſe controll and
terrifie them with their numerous followers, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of their Diſciples. Which leſt I may be
thought to report without book, we need but look
into <hi>Joſephus,</hi> where we ſhall finde that <hi>Alexandra</hi>

and promiſed to do nothing without their directions.
What was the reaſon, think ye, why that excellent
Lady humbled her ſelf ſo lowly to ſo proud a Sect?
marry ſhe did it by advice of her dying Husband,
whoſe Government proved not ſo ſucceſsful as the

               </gap>, in that
he had offended that prevailing faction. We need
not doubt but that all ſuch as have purſued the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of theſe Phariſees do propoſe their aims, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the foundation of their greatneſs upon the backs
of their Diſciples; whom if they have infected with
their dangerous principles, there is no man ſo ſafe,
whom they may not miſchief, nor any eſtate ſo ſure
which they may not ruine. Examples of the which,
in the Prieſts of <hi>Meroe,</hi> and that command they held
on the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> I could tell you ſome, but deſire
rather to refer you to <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> for your ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
So true is that of <hi>Quintus Curtius, Multitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
vana religione captam meliùs vatibus ſuis quàm

with a falſe Religion are more obedient to their

the Churches ſickneſs to the pitch or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:168623:177"/>

I make haſt, all the haſt I can, to call in the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
and attend the cure, <hi>Vigilate igitur, Watch
therefore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a great ſimilitude between the body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and the body myſtical, the bodies of us men,
and the Church of Chriſt: each of them hath their
infancy, their youth, their age; each of them their
peculiar maladies, and their proper cures. And as in
bodily Diſeaſes, no ſooner we begin to be ill-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but preſently we look out for the Phyſician; ſo
in theſe griefs and ſickneſſes which befall the
Church, it is not ſafe to trifle or delay the time, but
have recourſe to the Phyſician with all ſpeed that
may be. Now the Phyſicians in this caſe, the Churches
Doctors, are thoſe to whom this charge was given by
the Apoſtle, and they are ſaid to be the Elders of the
Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> What the Lay-Elders of the
City, men of ſhops and Trades; this day a bencher
in the Conſiſtory, the next a botcher on the ſtall?
Not ſo, though ſome have ſo delivered; but ſuch as
were at leaſt <hi>in ſacris ordinibus conſtituti,</hi> men in holy
orders, ſuch as had parts to feed the flock, and power
to rule it. The word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:168623:178"/>
Presbyters, the name and Office here muſt needs go
together. And though in our Tranſlation both here
and elſewhere, we render the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> by that
of <hi>Elder,</hi> yet when we finde it ſo tranſlated, we muſt
take it thus, that howſoever for their age they were
called Elders, yet by their Office they were Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Gods Word and Sacraments, ſuch as had
<hi>ſenectutem cordis,</hi> though not <hi>corporis,</hi> in St. <hi>Gregories</hi>
language. Prieſts they were then that here aſſembled,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Church-conſtruction; and yet not
ſimply Prieſts, and no more then ſo, but ſuch as
were above the reſt both in place and power, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and chief Rulers both of that and the neighbor-Churches.
The Text is plain, <hi>in quo vos Sp. S. poſuit
Epiſcopos,</hi> that the holy Ghoſt had made them Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
or Overſeers, as we read in the laſt Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And I ſaid well, that ſo we read it in the laſt; for
<hi>ab initio non fuit ſic,</hi> it was not ſo in the beginning. An
ancient M. S. Tranſlation, which by the Character
and Language I gueſſe to be as old as <hi>Wiclif,</hi> reads
it plainly <hi>Biſhops.</hi> So doth that alſo of <hi>Miles Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
a fervent Proteſtant in King <hi>Henries</hi> dayes, and
no great friend unto the calling, although one him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<hi>Beza,</hi> though he diſlike the Hierarchy, and
makes it a device of man, if not of Satan, yet
renders it <hi>Epiſcopos,</hi> as the vulgar doth. And ſo do the
Divines of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, though generally
in common ſpeech they rather do affect the Title of
a Superintendent; and ſo <hi>ex Graecis bonis Latinas fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
non bonas,</hi> as the Poet hath it. Only our laſt
Tranſlators, of all people elſe, when as they might
have kept themſelves with ſafety to the Greek Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals,
have brought us in an Overſeer for a Biſhop.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:168623:178"/>
Which if it were not done <hi>ut placerent populo,</hi> to
pleaſe the people, yet poſſibly it might be done <hi>quia
timebant ſibi à populo,</hi> becauſe they were afraid to
offend the people. A vein of which timidity one may
eaſily finde in many places of the Acts and Writings
of the holy Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But Overſeers let them be, the Overſeers, if you
pleaſe, of Chriſts Will &amp; Teſtament, the overſeers of
the Clergy, which are the Executors of that Will &amp;
Teſtament, appointed to adminiſter the Word and
Sacraments, which are the Legacies Chriſt left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him unto all the people. And Overſeers let
them be in name and dignity as well as Office; For
being that the Prieſt may be called a Seer, according
to that meaning of that notion, in the firſt of <hi>Samuel,
(He that is now called a Prophet was before called a
Seer,)</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. cap. 9. v. 9.</note> then certainly, the Biſhop being over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Prieſt may well be called an Overſeer. And
ſo all circumſtances pondered and compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we have gained thus much; that thoſe to whom
this charge was given were Biſhops, or Overſeers if
you will, ſuch unto whom the overſight of the flock
was truſted; ſuch unto whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks in his
firſt Epiſtle, <hi>Paſcite gregem Dei qui in vobis eſt,</hi> Feed

then certainly it is no abſurdity or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
to ſay, that the Presbytery in the 17th verſe,
whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> called from <hi>Epheſus</hi> and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Cities,
(<hi>ab Epheſo &amp; à reliquis proximis civitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
as in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>) were not ſimply Presbyters, but
ſuch as had preeminence above the reſt, whom the
Text honoured in the 28. with the name of Biſhops.
The Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was anciently a Metropolitan,
and had many Suffragans; which poſſibly may be the
reaſon why <hi>Epheſus</hi> is only named in the relation of
this Story.</p>
            <p>Having thus found out the Phyſician, I need not
dwell upon the remedy, but leave that to them;
<hi>credendum eſt artifici in arte ſua.</hi> We have had many

their betters, and teach the Biſhops how to govern.
All that I have to ſay is but <hi>vigilate,</hi> that it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Prelate to be very watchful; and that not
only in regard of Wolves, Hereticks, and all ſuch as
are counted Hereticks, as ſome men would have
them; but in relation unto ſubtile practiſers, and
ſuch as would fain riſe in the Churches fall. Not
only heterodox and heretical teachers, but facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and perverſe Preachers are brought within the
compaſs of this <hi>vigilate;</hi> and that by the direction of
St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who had his Warrant from above,
and knew how to uſe it. And indeed <hi>vigilate</hi> is the
ſafeſt Phyſick in the preſent caſe, not only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
but remove the ſickneſs. If <hi>vigilate</hi> be well fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:168623:179"/>
either men will not riſe at all, or being riſen,
dare not talk perverſly; or if they do, it muſt be
cloſly and in corners; and that will draw away but
few Diſciples to follow after and admire them. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Miniſters of God and his holy Church are
Watchmen in their ſeveral places over the little
flocks committed to them, the Biſhop is <hi>Praefectus
vigilum,</hi> the Captain of the Watch, the common
Centinel, who by his Office is to walk the round,
and ſee that the inferior Watchmen do diſcharge
their duties. The tidings of our Saviours birth was
firſt proclaimed unto a company of Shepherds keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
watch over their flocks by night; their care and
vigilance deſerved that comfort which the Angels
gave them, <hi>Nolite timere,</hi> Fear not, I bring you ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of great joy. The Watchmen which expect
the like grace and favour muſt not be ſhort of them
in their pains and travell; if they expect from God

            <p>
               <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells us of the living Creatures which he
beheld as in a viſion, <hi>totum corpus plenum oculis in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitu,</hi>
that they were full of eyes round about them:
the perfect Emblem of a vigilant and careful Prelate,
who muſt not only ſee before him, but have his eyes
in every corner of his Dioceſs, in every member of
his body: Eyes in his head, to underſtand his place and
function, that he be able to perform what belongs
unto him: Eyes in his feet, to have a care unto his
goings, that he give no offence or ſcandall in ſo high
a calling: Eyes in his hand, or <hi>Oculatus manus,</hi> as he
in <hi>Plautus,</hi> that he ordain no man unworthily: Nay,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:168623:180"/>
even his Crozier he muſt have eyes, he muſt have <hi>ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum

none but thoſe that deſerve correction. In a word,
as the good Father <hi>Iraeneus</hi> ſaid of God Almighty,
that he is <hi>totus oculus, &amp; totum lumen;</hi> ſo ſhould it
be reported of a careful Prelate, that he is eye all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and ſees round about him. Which if he do, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he may wink at ſome things out of humane fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilty,
and poſſibly connive at others out of juſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
yet will he ſtill have one eye open to have a
care upon the main.</p>
            <p>The Tale of <hi>Argus</hi> with his hundred eyes, how they
did watch and ſleep by turns when the guarded <hi>lo,</hi>
how he was <hi>voce nova captus,</hi> and <hi>virga medicata
tactus,</hi> won with a ſong, and blinded with a touch of
a charmed rod, is a pretty fable, but very uſeful in the
morall: And it doth plainly ſhew the Prelate this,
that if fine words can win him, and corruption blind
him, he will become a prey to every <hi>Mercury,</hi> and in
concluſion, loſe himſelf and the Church together.
<hi>Vigilate igitur,</hi> watch therefore, you that are this day
advanced to ſo high a dignity: And what I ſay to you

eſpecially if we reflect upon the hireling and the
Thief, which here he ſpeaks of; for if we mark the
ſituation of the Text, we finde it crucified in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
between two Malefactors, the Thief upon the
one hand, and the hireling on the other. The Thief
we finde in the 10th verſe, who comes into the Fold
to no other end, <hi>niſi ut furetur, &amp; mactet &amp; perdat,</hi>

that ſo we might be made the Sonnes of God. He for
a time did bow down the Heavens, and remained
with us on the Earth for a certain ſeaſon, that man
created of the Earth, might be taken with him up to
Heaven, and there live for ever. His incorruptible
did put on our corruption, that ſo our mortall might
be clothed with his immortality. And this in the

            <p>So then this <hi>Ego</hi> of my Text relates to Jeſus,
<hi>v.</hi> 1. and that unto the firſt of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where he
had his name, and where he was proclaimed by the

by the Virgin <hi>Mary. Ego</hi> here, <hi>Jeſus</hi> there; in both

to relieve us in them as our God, as God and

which are inherent in our fleſh, we may
hereafter reign with him in his endleſs glories. We
read in <hi>Livie,</hi> that when the <hi>Romans</hi> had violently

till both the Armies were made friends, and an
eternall League was ſworn between them. The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
is ſo eaſie and familiar that I need not preſs
it: Only I note, that this great work of our Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
could not be wrought by any but a Saviour,
and ſuch as had relation to both parties, both to God
and man; that being jealous of the honour of the
one, and zealous for the preſervation of the other,
he might make up that peace betwixt us which all
the powers of Hell ſhould not interrupt. Which work
of reconciliation, being a ſpecial part of that Paſtorall
charge which he hath taken to himſelf, leads me on
fairly to my ſecond generall, which is the Office of
our Saviour; <hi>Ego ſum ille Paſtor,</hi> I am that Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</p>
            <p>And here perhaps it may be ſaid, that we have
took great pains to a little purpoſe: Have we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
all this while to prove our Saviour to be the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:168623:184"/>
Sonne of the eternall ever-living God, and do we
now ſo much debaſe him as to make him a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd?
Have we advanced him up on high, and ſet
him at the right hand of God in the heavenly places,
<hi>ut lapſu graviore ruat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Claudian.</note> only to make his fall the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
Or with the Tempter in the Goſpel, have we
advanced him to the top of the higheſt Pinacle, and
told him that he was the Sonne of God, and then
come out with <hi>mitte te deorſum,</hi> caſt thy ſelf down
as farre as poverty and contempt can make thee?
This were a cunning peece of malice, if it were ſo
meant, in caſe the office of a Shepherd were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
and inconſiderable as ſome men have
made it. But if we look upon it well, we ſhall finde
the contrary; there being no inferior place of charge
or Government, more like unto the Kingly Office
then the Shepherds is: Upon which ground <hi>Homer</hi>

               </gap>, but the whole Tribe
of Poets alſo have honoured good Princes with
the ſame Attribute. Nay, in his Book of the life of
<hi>Joſeph</hi> he gives this note, that the beſt Shepherd
makes the beſt King: and in his Tract <hi>de vita Moſis</hi>
doth affirm expreſly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that the beſt preparation to the Kingly
Office is to be a Shepherd. In which regard St. <hi>Baſil</hi>
tells us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral

               </gap>, or preparation to the other.
But behold a greater then <hi>Philo</hi> or St. <hi>Baſil</hi> here: For
God himſelf hath ſaid of <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 44. v. 28:</note> that he was his

               </gap>, but to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

and he did lead them and conduct them as now
Princes do; whom therefore we are bound to honour
in the next degree to the Gods immortal. A Speech
ſo excellent and divine, that nothing but the written
word can go beyond it. But behold a greater then
<hi>Plato</hi> is here alſo; for God hath told us by the mouth
of his Servant <hi>David,</hi> that he is a Shepherd; <hi>Dominus
Paſtor meus, the Lord is my Shepherd,</hi> Pſal. 23. and
<hi>hear O thou Shepherd of Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 1. v. 1.</note> Pſal. 80.</p>
            <p>If therefore God may, without diminution of his
power and greatneſs, aſſume unto himſelf the name
of a Shepherd, aſſuredly the Sonne of God will think
it no diſparagement to be called ſo too. Or if it were,
what poor and low condition would not he gladly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:168623:185"/>
And certainly, if we conſult the Scriptures, we

Birth to be proclaimed to a company of ſhepherds; &amp;
choſe a ſtable, or a ſheep-coat rather, (as moſt Fathers

here amongſt us men, he took unto himſelf the name
of a Shepherd,<note place="margin">v. 11. 14.</note> being ſtyled ſo in this Chapter twice,
and talking of his Sheep throughout the whole. After
all this, being to take his farewel of us, (for as much
as did concern his bodily preſence) he left no greater
charge unto his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Joh. 21. v. 16, 17.</note> then, <hi>Paſcite oves meas,</hi> to
feed his ſheep. One further evidence to this purpoſe
we will make bold to borrow out of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> works,
who tells a Story of one <hi>Thames,</hi> that as he ſailed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Greece,</hi> was by a ſtrange voyce, but from whence
he knew not, commanded to make known when he
came on Land, that <hi>Pan</hi> the Shepherds God was dead.
This <hi>Pan</hi> the Authour takes to be the ſonne of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
and <hi>Penelope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plutarch de Oracul. ceſſat.</note> when the Gentiles worſhipped: But
they which looked with more advice into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
conceive it rather to be meant of the Sonne of
God, and the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> who much about the
time which that Authour ſpeaks of, did ſuffer death
upon the Croſſe for our redemption, and was indeed
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:168623:186"/>
the true God <hi>Pan,</hi> chief Shepherd of the ſoul of
man.</p>
            <p>A Shepherd then our Saviour was, there's no
doubt of that; we might have took it abſolutely on
his <hi>Ipſe dixit.</hi> But how he doth diſcharge the office,
is in the next place to be conſidered. And this we
ſhall the better ſee, by looking for a while on the
Country-ſhepherd, whoſe duty doth conſiſt in three
points eſpecially; 1. In the feeding, 2. In the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
And 3. In the guarding of the ſheep committed
to him. For feeding firſt, there is no queſtion to be
made but that it is a part of the ſhepherds office. The
very name doth intimate ſo much unto us; for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
à paſcendo,</hi> a ſhepherd is ſo called from feeding,
and that not in the Language of the Latines only, but
in Greek and Hebrew. This duty mentioned in the
<hi>Georgicks, Luciferi primo cum ſydere frigida rura carpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi>
in which he doth adviſe his ſhepherd, that at the
dawning of the day he unfold his ſheep, and drive
them out into their Paſture. And this exemplified in
<hi>Jacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 30, 31.</note> and the ſonnes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> honeſt ſhepherds all;
it being ſaid of <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Book of God,<note place="margin">37. 12.</note> 
               <hi>that he did
feed the Sheep of Laban;</hi> of <hi>Jacob's</hi> ſonnes, <hi>that they
did feed their Fathers flocks in Sichem.</hi> And finally,

is paſt all controverſie: The Prophet hath foreſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
that he ſhould ſo do; <hi>I will ſet up one Shepherd
over them:</hi> and the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> declare that he did ſo
do, For what were all thoſe heavenly Sermons, thoſe
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:168623:186"/>
frequent exhortations unto faith and piety which he
ſo often made unto them, but a ſpirituall feeding of
the inward man, a ſweet refection of the ſoul, a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall
nouriſhment? His feeding of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
by a few Loaves of Bread, and two ſmall fiſhes,
what was it, though a ſignall miracle, compared with
thoſe many millions which he doth feed continually
with the bread of life? We need not doubt of the
ſucceſs, when he that fed them with the Word was
the Word it ſelf; or of the ſpreading of the Goſpel,
when he that was the Preacher was the Goſpel too;

According to the good old verſe,</p>
            <p>—<hi>Attrahe per primum, medio rege punge per imum;</hi>

that the good Shepherd ſhould oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

Sheep become unruly, and will not hear the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds-pipe,
pipe he never ſo ſweetly; he muſt needs
take his ſtaffe in hand, there's no other remedy. But
I touch onely on theſe Controverſies, and ſo paſſe
them by.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt duty which pertains unto the
Shepherd is, that he guard his ſheep, and keep them
ſafe, from the devouring malice of the enemy. In
which regard, it is the Cuſtom of thoſe Countries
which are plagued with Wolves, to lodge their ſheep
at night in <hi>defoſsis ſpecubus,</hi> in ſome ſtrong Caverns
under ground, and free from violence. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
the Poet <hi>Virgil</hi> doth adviſe his ſhepherd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
himſelf of ſome fierce Maſtives, <hi>acres moloſſos,</hi>
as he calls them, by whom the flock may be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
during his own neceſſary abſence. And finally,
in this regard the faithful Shepherd doth expoſe his
perſon unto much peril, many inconveniences, and
ſeveral aſſaults of enemies. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> tells us of
himſelf, that when he kept the ſheep of <hi>Laban, the
drought conſumed him by day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 31. v. 40.</note> 
               <hi>and the Froſt by night, and
that ſleep departed from his eyes.</hi> And in the Story of
Gods Book we are told of <hi>David,</hi> that when he kept
his Fathers ſheep, and that a Bear and a Lion had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
a Lamb,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30, 35.</note> he ſet himſelf againſt the fury of
thoſe ravenous Beaſts, and delivered the poor Lamb
out of their pawes, and in a ſingle combat ſlew them
both.</p>
            <p>So is it with our Saviour Chriſt in the protection
of his Church, in the defence of thoſe who are the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:168623:190"/>
ſheep of his Paſture. It was his glory, as it was his
comfort,<note place="margin">John.</note> that of all thoſe whom God had given him,
he had loſt not one. And 'twas his comfort as it was
his care, that he had lodged them in a place of ſuch
ſtrength and ſafety, even in his ſtrongeſt hold, his
holy Tabernacle; againſt the which the Gates of
Hell ſhall never be able to prevail. A place in which
if we continue, we need not fear the violence of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
that roaring Lion,<note place="margin">1 Pet.</note> who walks about the Fold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
<hi>ſeeking out whom he may devoure.</hi> And it is
well ſaid that he walks about; for get into the Fold
he cannot: and therefore doth he walk about it, that
ſo if any of the flock do forſake the Fold, him he

them round about his Church, in each corner of

and continual barking, they may keep farre aloof
the common enemy, by whom the ſtraglers are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered.

doth concern this buſineſs, is his ſpecial goodneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained

manifeſted &amp; declared in delivering them from evil,
the evil both of ſin and puniſhment; and in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating
on them his moſt ſacred bleſſings both of
grace and glory. For if an earthly Father, (as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
urgeth) though full of evil in himſelf,<note place="margin">Matth.</note> knoweth
how to provide good things for his natural Children:
how much more ſhall our Father which is in Heaven,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:168623:192"/>
beſtow good things on thoſe whom he hath adopted.
This is enough to make us ſenſible of Gods goodneſs
to us. And yet the way by which this goodneſs is
procured for us is far more admirable:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> the Lord not
ſparing his own Sonne, but delivering him up for us
all, that with him he might alſo freely give us all
things, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructs us.</p>
            <p>This is indeed the higheſt point of heavenly good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And very hard it is to ſay, whether deſerve
more of our admiration, either that God the Father
ſhould appoint it ſo, or God the Sonne conſidered in
our fleſh, ſhould act the Tragedy. I ſhall no longer
wonder at the ſtrange Command which God once
layd upon our Father <hi>Abraham. Abraham take now

in the former times, by many of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
that their very fleſh was rarified into ſpirit; and

A matter not ſo gracious I confeſs unto fleſh and

difficulty, in any heart that is truly Chriſtian; by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one who ſeriouſly conſiders how much the moſt
that he can ſuffer for the ſake of Chriſt, comes ſhort
of that which Chriſt hath ſuffered for the ſake of
man: he being immortal, and not ſubject unto death,
unleſs he would; we mortal, &amp; of neceſſity to die, how

firſt or laſt muſt bind up all our ſenſes; and in the
bottom of the Grave we ſhall all be lodged. This all
the difference, that ſome of us may be ſooner had to
bed, and not laid down ſo eaſily as the others are. Add
unto this the comfortable words of Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
in St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, <hi>qui perdiderit animam

to die, be not the readieſt way to live for ever: if
thus to venture all for the ſake of Chriſt, be not the
ſureſt way to keep all from hazard, and to receive
our own with uſury. Thus muſt we be reſolved, if
ever, as God knowes how ſoon, there ſhould be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion:
and though there never be occaſion, (as God
grant there be not) yet muſt we all be thus affected,

of relatives, and there are mutual and
reciprocal Offices to be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. The Sheepherd calls the
Sheep by name, and they hear his
voice; he leads them in the way, and they follow
him. This Sheepherd who it is we have ſeen already;
it is Chriſt our Saviour, the great Sheepherd of the
Sheep as St. <hi>Paul;</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

ſaid of this, then what our Saviour hath affirmed in
that kind before, who did not only take upon himſelf
the name and office of a Sheepherd, but chalenged to

            <p>How farre our bleſſed Saviour hath diſcharged his
Office, not only as a Sheepherd, but the good Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
too, we have ſhewn already. <hi>Superat pars altera
curae lanigeros agitare greges;</hi> That which remains
behind, doth concern our ſelves, the duties wherein
we ſtand bound by the Lord our Sheepherd. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
it is to be expected, that if he ſpeak unto us,
we ſhould alſo hearken; if he preach to us, we ſhould
practiſe. More then this he requires not of us; and
leſſe then this we could not do, did he not require it.
The hearing of his voyce when he ſpeaks unto us, is
an eaſie piety: and we ſhould ill deſerve the benefit
even of outward ſenſe, did we not hearken unto him
who made the eare; or lend an eare to him, who
firſt gave it us. The following of his ſteps in the way
of godlineſs, may perhaps ſeem an harder duty; and
yet of no ſuch difficulty, if conſidered rightly, when
he which leads the way doth ſupport us in it. We
ſhall ill finde the way to immortality, if we were left
unto our ſelves; who caſt ſuch doubts, and make ſuch
poor excuſes to delay the journey, having ſo ſure a
Guide, ſuch a brave Conductor, not only to direct us
that we do not erre, but to ſuſtain us alſo that we do
not fall. Theſe the chief duties which he looks for
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:168623:196"/>
from us; and theſe he gives us in the words now read
unto you. <hi>Oves meae vocem meam audiunt, My Sheep
hear my voyce, and follow me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words, as they relate unto our ſelves, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto us theſe three things to be conſidered.
1. The condition of Gods people, as they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to us in the name of ſheep: firſt <hi>Oves,</hi> and
then <hi>Oves meae,</hi> Chriſts Sheep, the ſheep of his moſt
bleſſed Paſtures. 2. The duties here expected from
them, which are <hi>audire &amp; ſequi,</hi> to hear and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
or rather ſo to hear that we may follow the
better. 3. We have the object of this duty, which is
twofold alſo, <hi>vocem meam, me;</hi> not my voice only,
but my foot-ſteps too. Theſe are the points to be
conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beginning firſt with the condition of Gods
people, as they are repreſented to us in the name of
ſheep: firſt ſingle in themſelves as <hi>Oves,</hi> then as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in one fold, under one chief Shepherd, <hi>oves meae,</hi>
my ſheep, the whole flock together. Firſt then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ovis eſt molle pecus, corpore inerme, animo placidum.</hi>
The ſheep is ſaid by <hi>Iſidore,</hi> to be a creature of a very
meek and quiet nature, of great, both innocency and
ſimplicity: diſarmed, and ſo by conſequence diſabled
from doing the leaſt hurt or injury to any other. In
this regard, our Saviour Chriſt was likened by the
Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> unto a ſheep before the Shearer. Who
though he was not only ſhorn,<note place="margin">53. 7.</note> but fleeced; nay both
oppreſſed and afflicted, as the Text informs us: yet
he indured it all with patience. He opened not his
mouth, but was dumb before them; reviling not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
when he was reviled, nor uſing threatning words
when he ſuffered wrongfully; but withall, meekneſs
and humility committed his whole cauſe to him who<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 23.</note>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:168623:197"/>
judgeth righteouſly. In this regard, our Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to warn his followers of thoſe falſe Prophets,
which the Devil did intend to ſend amongſt them, he
lets them know that they ſhould come in Sheeps
cloathing, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they ſhould be apparelled with
all ſhewes of meekneſs, innocency and humility, and
ſuch like amiable qualities, ſuch as win moſt on the
affections of miſguided men. Nay it is noted by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,
in nomine Ovis innocentiam &amp; ſimplicitatem
per totam ſcripturam deſignari;</hi> that through the whole
body of the Scripture, innocency and ſimplicity are
expreſſed unto us under the notion of the ſheep.
Which though perhaps it be not univerſally true (as
perhaps it may be) yet doth it very well agree with
the condition of the ſheep, which is not only <hi>molle
pecus,</hi> a creature of a mild and tender nature; but for
the moſt part white of color, <hi>quam dives nivei pecoris,</hi>
as he in <hi>Virgil,</hi> which is the ſign or robe of innocence.</p>
            <p>Such alſo are the ſheep of our Saviours Paſture,
walking in their vocation, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth, with
all lowlineſs and meekneſs; waſhing their hands in
innocence with the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prophet <hi>David;</hi> putting away
high mindedneſs and pride, and arrogance, as things
which are not competible with their Chriſtian Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Our Saviour Chriſt hath not only taught us to
be <hi>wiſe as Serpents, but to be innocent as Doves alſo.</hi>
Nor hath he called upon us only that we be <hi>holy as he
is holy,</hi> and per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect, <hi>as our Father in Heaven is perfect:</hi>
but he would have us learn of him, how to be meek
and lowly of heart, <hi>ut requiem inveniamus animabus
nostris,</hi> that we may finde reſt unto our ſouls. Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is the firſt ſtep in that ſacred ladder which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up from Earth to Heaven; and there we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:168623:197"/>
our riſe, if ever we intend to attain the top. And
for the Gates of Heaven, they are ſtrait and narrow,
and can be entred only by the <hi>meek in heart, by the poor
in ſpirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> It was the lowlineſs of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> that
the Lord regarded; <hi>the humble and the meek that he
exalteth.</hi> The wiſe man <hi>Chilo,</hi> though an Heathen,
could have taught us this. Who being asked what
<hi>Jupiter</hi> did uſe to do,<note place="margin">Laert in chil.</note> returned this anſwer, <gap reason="foreign">

down the mighty from their Seat, and doth exalt the
humble and meek.</hi> Exalt them then he will, for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

their Brethren, but in the world to come amongſt
the Angels.<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bleſſed are the meek in heart, for they ſhall inherit the
Earth;</hi> he alſo hath affirmed, <hi>that bleſſed are the poor
in ſpirit, quoniam ipſorum eſt Regnum coelorum, for theirs
is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe qualities of lowlineſs, meekneſs and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as they are at all times very neceſſary; ſo
moſt eſpecially at that time, when we come to hear,
to exerciſe that Office, and perform that duty which
is here required. The proud man hates to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the impatient will not brook a reprehenſion.
The one thinks no man good enough to be his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer;
the other ſtorms and flies out into fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the leaſt reproof. The one thinks ſcorn to come
to Chriſt, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſuch publick places; They expect rather, and King
<hi>Herod</hi> did in the holy Goſpel,<note place="margin">Luke 23.</note> till he be brought unto
their Houſes: and then too, if they be not ſatisfied
in their curioſities, they ſet him at naught, laugh at
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:168623:198"/>
him to his very face, <hi>&amp; veſte alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> indutum illudunt,</hi>
put the fools coat upon him, and ſo ſend him going.
The other come about him like the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note>
and hearken greedily to his words. But if he
touch upon their vices, if he denounce a woe againſt
them for their pride and arrogance, their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs,
hypocriſie, and deſire of glory, they then take
counſel preſently, how they may deſtroy him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe are in a fit condition to repair to Chriſt;
or if they do, are like to get but little by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him. <hi>Dirigit manſuetos in judicio;</hi> they are the
meek only whom God guides in judgement, the
meek whom he inſtructeth in his holy wayes. In vain
do they reſort unto him to hear his voyce, who uſe to
come with hardned, not with humbled hearts.</p>
            <p>But there's another quality of the ſheep, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to the work of hearing on the <hi>Poſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fact,</hi> as meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and humility in the preparation, or <hi>a parte ante:</hi>
which is the chewing of the Cud, as we uſe to call it.
The <hi>Latines</hi> call it rumination. <hi>Illice ſub nigra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
ruminat herb as,</hi> as the Poet hath it. And they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
that terme from the old word <hi>rumen,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
that little bag or ventricle, into the which it is
conveyed before the ſecond chewing of it; or elſe
as <hi>Servius</hi> hath it in his notes on <hi>Virgil,</hi> from the moſt
prominent part of the throat, called <hi>Ruma, per quam
demiſſus cibus revocatur,</hi> by which they do recall that
food into their mouthes, which they had lodged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their ſtomacks. The reaſon of this rumination I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
not here, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It properly
belongs to the Philoſopher, and to him we leave it.
All I ſhall note from hence is this, that <hi>ruminare</hi> by a
Metaphor, is ſometimes taken for <hi>in memoriam revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care,</hi>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:168623:198"/>
to call again to our remembrance: the recalling
of ſuch things into our memories, which either have
been loſt out of them, or miſlaid in them, being much
of the ſame nature in a man, as is the other in a Beaſt.
The ſheep comes haſtily to feed, and in that haſt, doth
not ſo thorowly chew and prepare their food, and fit
it for digeſtion, as do other creatures: but when the
fury of their Appetite is a little ſlackned, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
upon it as it were a ſecond eating, that it may be
more perfectly concocted, and made fit for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Atque iterum paſto paſcitur ante cibo,</hi> as it is in
<hi>Ovid.</hi> And this no queſtion is required in every one
who doth deſire to be accounted for a ſheep of our
Saviours Paſture, and comes with haſt and hunger to
hear his voyce. It was the Precept given by <hi>David</hi>
to the great Kings Daughter, not to hear only, but
to conſider: <hi>hearken O Daughter and conſider,</hi> Pſal. 45.
And '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>was the greateſt commendation of the Virgin

keep the ſayings of her Lord and Saviour, <hi>conferens in
corde ſuo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 2. 19.</note> and pondered them duly in her heart. This is
that commanded by the Lord to his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that
they ſhould lay up his words in their hearts,<note place="margin">Deut. 11. 18.</note> and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
on the ſame both day and night; commended
by St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the <hi>Beroeans,</hi> who did not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Word with all readineſs of mind, but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
compared it with the holy Scriptures:<note place="margin">Acts 17. 11.</note> and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
an excellent chewing of the cud, a profitable art
of benefiting by the word revealed. For they who
thus do chew the cud, are of all others the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not only to preſerve the word in their hearts and
memories, but to obſerve it alſo in their words and
actions.</p>
            <pb n="374" facs="tcp:168623:199"/>
            <p>This is indeed the principal end both of our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

were it with us all, did we imploy our memories to ſo
good a purpoſe; could we take counſel of the ſheep,
and learn this excellent art of chewing the cud as we
ought to do; for as it hapneth too too often, the ſoul
hath never leſſe command upon the memory, then in
thoſe things which appertain to its own ſalvation.
Trifles and toyes, conceits and pleaſant paſſages of
wit float on the top thereof, and are ſtill at hand.
<hi>Poſco &amp; adſunt illico,</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath it. But ſuch
things as concern Chriſts Kingdom and his holy
words,<note place="margin">Confeſſ.</note> theſe either are quite loſt, and we look not
after them, or ſo miſlaid, we cannot find them. Such
is the common frailty of us mortal men, that the beſt
things are laſt learnt, and firſt forgotten. A frailty no
way to be rectified, but by a frequent pondering of
the word of God, a due revolving of it in our thoughts
and memories: whether we read it in the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ures,
or hear it publiſhed in our Churches. By doing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
we ſhall not only hear Gods Word, nor peruſe it
onely, nor onely keep it in our memories, as a tale or
Story; but turn the words thereof to works: and
thereby verifie that good note of <hi>Bernard,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This if we do, we ſhall come nearer to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſheep then before we were: which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
profitable creature and exceeding fruitful of good
works. For whereas it was either profit or pleaſure
which firſt brought Beaſts into the ſervice and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
of man; the ſheep hath the preheminence
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:168623:199"/>
of them all in the point of profit. <hi>Quadrupedum qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

creature, we have not only all things neceſſary for the
life of man, but many things which are for pleaſure
and convenience. Thus have we Cloaths of courſer
wearing from their Skins, of finer from their Wooll;
meat from their fleſh, medicine from their blood, and
Muſick from their Bowels. And when the Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes
his comfortable beames from the ſight of
man, we make our ſelves an artificial day by their
fat and Tallow. Nay, they afford us an increaſe alſo,
both of Bread and Beere; and in ſome parts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial

as it doth expreſs moſt fully the bountiful condition

the great Shepherd of our ſouls,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> as St. <hi>Peter</hi>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:168623:200"/>
calls him. He dwells not near us, that we ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
him to our Feaſts or Banquets; nor can we ſee
him face to face, to make him partaker of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
But this, although it be a common, is a falſe
pretence. God dwells amongſt us in his poor, and in
his Prophets; and he expects that we be bountiful to
them whom he hath ſubſtituted in his place, either
as inſtruments of our edification, or objects of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality.
The Prophet or the Prieſt, call him which
you will, is in the Scriptures called a Sheepherd; and
all that are committed to his charge and care are his
Sheep, his Flock. And doth not equity require and
the Scriptures dictate,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> 
               <hi>that he which feedèth the Flock,
ſhould alſo feed himſelf with the milk of the Flock,</hi> and
ſometimes cloath himſelf with the Fleece thereof?
The Law of nature and of Nations have reſolved this
caſe. And he muſt needs rebel againſt both of them,
who grudgeth the poor Prieſt that maintenance
which the Law allowes him; or ſhall compel him to
make up his full tale of bricks, and take away the
ſtraw and ſtubble which before he had. So for the
poor, they alſo have a warrant <hi>dormant;</hi> or if you will,
a general Letter of Atturney, to receive our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and to receive them alſo in the name of God.

from the fury and the heats thereof. Which if it be
ſo, as I have no reaſon to ſuſpect the Authours, it is a
ſympathy full of ſcandal to the ſonnes of men; who
for the moſt part, are ſo farre from making ſhade to
the afflicted and oppreſſed, that if their ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
will any way conduce unto our advantage,
we uſe to lay them in the Sun. Such miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters
were the friends of <hi>Job,</hi> who when they ſhould
have laboured to revive his ſpirits, endeavoured to
afflict his conſcience: and ſuch the <hi>Ziphites</hi> unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
inſtead of being a comfort to him in the time of
his exile, they practiſe to deliver him into the hands
of <hi>Saul.</hi> We are all of us apt enough to comply with
one part of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> injunction, which is <hi>gaudere cum
gaudentibus,</hi> to rejoyce with them that do rejoyce, to
ſhare with men in their proſperities, and be partakers
of their glories; and do it, though we be not bidden.
But for the other part thereof, which is <hi>dolere cum
dolentibus,</hi> to weep with them that weep, and bear a
part in their affliction; we will by no means yield to
that, though we be intreated. In that quite contrary
to the counſel of the wiſe Philoſopher, who would
have no man come uncalled to a friend or neighbour,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but in the times of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
and his adverſity.</p>
            <p>Next, let us look upon the ſheep, as they are a
flock; as they are <hi>Oves</hi> firſt in the plural number, and
ſecondly, as <hi>Oves meae,</hi> my ſheep, the ſheep of Chriſt,
a multitude, or number, under the command of one
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:168623:201"/>
ſupreme Sheepherd. Firſt, <hi>Oves</hi> in the plural number,
otherwiſe Chriſt could have no Church, and the great
Sheepherd would have never a Flock. One ſheep can
no more properly be called a Flock, then one Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
may be ſaid to make a Summer; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, a multitude of ſheep without rule or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
is no more a flock, then ſeveral ſhreds of
Cloth may be called a Garment. So is it alſo with
the Church, one man though never ſo repleniſhed
with celeſtial Graces, cannot ſo properly be called a
Church, as a Chappel of Eaſe: and multitudes of
men that live not under one Lord, one Faith, one
Baptiſme, cannot with ſuch propriety be termed a
Church, as a confuſion of opinions. To the making
therefore of a Church, a Flock; there is a number
firſt required, and next an union or conſolidation
of thoſe numbers. Its true, this number hath not been
at all times eminent, nor equally conſpicuous in all
places; and yet there have been ſtill a number. Seven
thouſand knees there were in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which <hi>Elijah</hi>
knew not, that had not bowed themſelves to <hi>Baal,</hi>
and infinite numbers in the Realm of <hi>Judah,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
offered ſacrifice to that wretched Idol; viſible
Profeſſors of Gods ſaving truths and devout wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
of his holy name. Nor ever was the Church
ſo deſtitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of the grace of God, as not to hold thoſe
neceſſary fundamental Doctrines which are required
unto ſalvation: and thoſe profeſſed and taught in
ſome place or other according to the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Almighty God. Since God firſt had a Church,
there have ſtill been numbers of Profeſſors; though
more or leſſe, according unto times and ſeaſons, more
in ſome places then in others, although not alwayes
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:168623:201"/>
in ſuch whole and ſound condition, ſo free from erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and corruptions as it ought to be.</p>
            <p>But number ſimply, is not ſo great a ſtrength to
the Church of God, as is the unity thereof. For as
the holy Ghoſt in the Book of Pſalms,<note place="margin">Pſal. 122.</note> compares the
Church not unto men,<note place="margin">c. 6. v. 4.</note> but to a City, <hi>a City at unity
in it ſelf,</hi> and in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> not unto Souldiers, but
an Army,<note place="margin">v. 6.</note> 
               <hi>an Army terrible with banners;</hi> ſo doth he
liken it not unto ſheep, but to a flock, a flock new
come from waſhing, in the ſame Song of <hi>Solomon;</hi> a
little flock,<note place="margin">c. 12.</note> as himſelf calls it in St. <hi>Luke.</hi> And if a
flock, it muſt be then united and collected into one
Fold, under the leading and command of the ſame
one Sheepherd: <hi>unum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vile,</hi> and <hi>unus Paſtor,</hi> being
joyned together in this Chapter, v. 16. To finde this
one Sheepherd who it is, we need ſeek no further then
my Text, it is Chriſt our Saviour; who therefore
calleth them <hi>oves meas,</hi> his own ſheep; his as the chief
ſheepherd and proprietary, the Lord and owner of the
flock. And this ſupreme and univerſal ſheepherd we
acknowledge gladly, and ſhould account our ſelves in
an ill condition were we not under his command, fed
by his bleſſed Word and Sacraments, and ſafely ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
under the wings of his protection. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
another who pretends to this, this univerſal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
over all the Flock: one who cries out with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyphemus</hi>

one Faith, one Baptiſme: our Maſters in the Church

patch ſubjoyned to the old definition of a Church,
much like the piece of new Cloth put to an old Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which our Saviour ſpeaketh of. That which is
added to it to make up the rent,<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 17.</note> takes from the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Garment; <hi>Et ſciſſura fit pejor,</hi> ſaith the
Text, the Schiſme or rupture is made worſe then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was. For by this patch, this new addition, the
Churches of the Eaſt which are large and numerous;
thoſe of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thiopians,</hi> which are
farre more entire, though not ſo populous; and all
the Churches alſo of the Reformation are cut off for
ever from having any part in <hi>David,</hi> or hope of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
in the ſonne of <hi>Jeſſe.</hi> But with this new
Divinity we have nought to do. We know but one
chief Sheepherd onely, even the Lord Chriſt Jeſus,
whoſe voyce we are to hear, whom we ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>If it be asked, whether the number or the unity of
the flock, be the more conſiderable; no queſtion but
we muſt determine it in behalf of unity. A ſmall
flock if it hold together, are leſſe obnoxious to the
Wolf, then multitudes of ſheep diſperſed and ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without rule and order. <hi>Luporum inſidiis oves mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
patent, quod ita catervatim incedant, &amp; à reliquis
non aberrent,</hi> as mine Authour hath it. When the
ſheep keep together in a flock, a Body, the Wolf dare
hardly meddle with them; for it were madneſs in
him to attempt a flock. But if he meet them ſingle,
or in ſcattered Companies, divided from the main
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:168623:202"/>
Body of their fellows; or otherwiſe ſtragling from
the Fold: then takes he his advantage of them, and
deſtroyes them utterly. As long as <hi>Dinah</hi> kept her
ſelf within the Sanctuary of her Fathers Houſe, fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the valour of her Brethren, and guided by the
counſels of a careful Parent; it went well with her,
ſhe preſerved her honour.<note place="margin">Gen. 34.</note> But when the gadding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
took her, and ſhe muſt needs abroad to ſee the
Daughters of the Land; ſhe forthwith met with <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi>
the Sonne of <hi>Hamor,</hi> who ſeized upon her and
defiled her. And ſo it alſo is with the ſtragling Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
ſuch as do peeviſhly divide themſelves from the
Communion of the Church, and wander from the
reſt of that ſacred Body; <hi>They either fall into the jawes
of the roaring Lion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet.</note> who walkes about in expectation
of his prey, <hi>ſeeking out whom he may devoure;</hi> or elſe
by hearkening to the voice of ſtrangers,<note place="margin">John 10.</note> whom they
ſhould not follow, they make themſelves a ſpoyl
unto <hi>Theeves and Robbers.</hi> Keep we then all together
in one Fold, one Flock; and ſo we need not fear the
violence of Satan, nor the power of Hell, nor any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
deſign of malicious men. And if we would
preſerve the ſpirit of unity in the bond of peace, we
cannot do it with leſſe hazard, nor with more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
then if we hearken diligently to the voyce of
Chriſt, and tread with patience in his ſteps, which are
the duties to be done, and come next in order to be
handled.</p>

Now no man brings this knowledge of, or this faith

and ſo prepared to entertain it. Beſides, it

               </gap>, the ſpirituall

Which as it naturally doth ariſe from the moyſt and
flegmatick conſtitution of their bodies; ſo is it then
moſt frequent and predominant in them, when to the
natural moyſture of their bodies is added alſo the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
moyſture of their Paſtures. No way to help it
or prevent it, but to change their Paſtures, to lead
them up unto the Mountains, to places of a ſweet,
but more wholſom Herbage. So is it alſo with us
men, with our Saviours ſheep. We are all rotten
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:168623:203"/>
from the womb: in ſin our Mothers have conceived
us, ſaith the Royal Pſalmiſt: but then moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
affected with it, when to the natural corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our diſpoſition are added alſo the diſeaſes of
our education:<note place="margin">Tully in Phil. 2</note> 
               <hi>Crederes nos naturâ non tam improbos

diſeaſed and ill-affected, what means is left us for the
cure? ſurely there is no other way to remedy the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
of our converſation, but by the phyſick of the
Word; nor other way to make that phyſick effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
but by applying it to the ear, That is the
mouth wherewith we muſt take down thoſe potions
which the Phyſitians of our ſouls have preſcribed

            <p>Next let us look upon the Word as it is our food,
<hi>man living not by bread alone, but by every word procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from the mouth of God;</hi> food fitted for all Ages
and for all conditions. Are we but Novices in the
things of God, but Babes of yeſterday? then it goes
for milk. <hi>As new-born babes deſire ye the ſincere milk
of the Word, that ye may grow thereby,</hi> ſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath

               <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note> ſo St. <hi>Paul hath told us.</hi>
Are ye of curious taſts and affected palates? then it

there are both Sweet-meats to delight the Taſt, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſado's
to revive the Palate, Tart ſtuff to ſet an edge
upon the Appetite, Lenitives to open and unknit
Obſtructions, Cordials to heighten and advance our
Spirits. And by what means do we become partakers
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:168623:204"/>
of thoſe heavenly Viands, but onely by the mouth
of our Underſtanding;<note place="margin">de reſur. carnis.</note> 
               <hi>auditu devorandus eſt hic pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,

and celeſtial food muſt be firſt ſwallowed with

and finally digeſted by our Faith, as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
hath it: ſo that in each of thoſe reſpects and in all

ears to hear let him hear:</hi> and yet that's not all.</p>
            <p>Not all aſſuredly, there's no thought of that; the
way to Heaven were very eaſie if it ſhould be ſo.
There's not a Scribe or Phariſee in all the Goſpel but
had been Sainted long before this time, if hearing
onely in it ſelf, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> as the Schoolmen
phraſe it, could have brought them thither. They
heard the voice of Chriſt, none oftner, but they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heard it; and in this place <hi>audire</hi> goes a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The hearing,<note place="margin">Servius in Aeneid. 3.</note> as it is the ſenſe of diſcipline, ſo
was the ear (the inſtrument of hearing) of old times
conſecrated to the memory. <hi>Phyſici dicunt ſingulas

We muſt ſo hear then that we do remember,
not make our ears a thorough-fare, and no more then
ſo: and yet this is not all we muſt look to neither.
<hi>Audire eſt credere &amp; obedire,</hi> as mine author tells me.
To hear is to believe and practiſe; firſt to believe
that what we heare delivered in the Word is true, and
then to practiſe it as fit and neceſſary to be done: this
is the hearing we muſt truſt too if we look for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
'Tis not the ſhutting of our eyes, and turning
all the body into an ear that will ſave our ſoules;
there's ſomewhat elſe which muſt be thought of. Firſt
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:168623:204"/>
to commit to memory thoſe ſaving Doctrines which
we have heard delivered from the Word of God,
and next to expreſs the power thereof in our lives and

the Apoſtle to the Romans.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſtrange that hearing in the Book of God
ſhould be interpreted Obedience. It was the firſt
quarrel which God had with <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
               <hi>quia audiiſti vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem

of his wife. What, had God given her to him for a
comfort, and doth he now find fault that he heard her
ſpeak? what comfort can there be in a ſullen wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?
in a dumb woman none at all. Not ſo: 'twas
not the hearing of <hi>Eves</hi> voice that the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
but his obeying of the ſame, his yielding to
her wanton motions, and attributing more unto her
deſires then to Gods Commandements. <hi>Audiſti,</hi> i. e.

to obey is better then ſacrifice, and to hearken then the
fat of Rams.</hi> Where <hi>auſcultare &amp; obedire</hi> to hearken

ears: That had been to invite his followers to that
very fault which he blamed in others, which was <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientes
non audiunt,</hi> the people heard his word, and
yet heard it not: <hi>i. e.</hi> they heard the Word but did
not do it. They onely hear his Word aright, which
do hear with profit: which if we do, we ſhall not
onely hear his word as is here commanded, but ſhall
ſo hear his voice as to follow him, which is moſt
chiefly here intended; but of this we ſhall ſpeak
more anon.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we muſt take notice of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
which we are to hear. <hi>Audite ipſum, hear ye him,</hi> ſo

ſo ſaith God the Son, and both theſe are one. <hi>Ipſe</hi>
there, which is God the word, is here <hi>vox mea,</hi> or
the word of God, both moſt apparently the ſame.
Indeed it is not to be thought, that he which is the
Word ſhould more conveniently expreſs himſelf in
any other way then by his voice: for howſoever
that of the Apoſtle be moſt unqueſtionably true,
that God at ſundry times and in divers manners

yet ſtill we are at <hi>locutus eſt Deus,</hi> that God
ſpake unto them, &amp; ſpeak he could not properly but
by a voice; nay, if we look upon it well, we ſhall
ſurely find that the firſt external action aſcribed to
God in holy Scripture is <hi>dixit Dominus,</hi> the Lord
ſpake;<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> and that was a miraculous kind of ſpeech in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,

all things. This is that He, and his that Voice which
we are to hear; and well it is, and moſt agreeable to
our infirmities that he ſhould ſpeak to us by a voice.
For ſhould he ſpeak unto us now as at the giving of
the Law in <hi>Sinai,</hi>

               <hi>Speak thou unto us</hi> (ſaid the Jews to <hi>Moſes</hi>)
<hi>and we will hear, but let not God ſpeak to us leſt we die,

               <note place="margin">4 v. 16.</note> a ſmall ſlender voice; ſuch as <hi>Job</hi> calleth
<hi>vocem aurae lenis,</hi> a ſtill ſilent voice; ſuch as may
charme but not aſtoniſh, and which is fitter to invite
attention then to excite our fears.</p>
            <p>Now of this truth we find a very pregnant inſtance
in the hiſtory of <hi>Elijah,</hi> as it is repreſented to us in the
Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> God called upon him to go forth and
ſtand upon the Mount before him, &amp; then it follows,
<hi>And behold the Lord paſſed by, and a great ſtrong wind
rent the Mountains,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 19. 11, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>and broke in peeces the Rocks before
the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind, and after
the wind an Earthquake, but the Lord was not in the
Earthquake; and after the Earthquake a Fire, but the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:168623:206"/>
Lord was not in the Fire; and after the Fire a ſtill ſmall
Voice, ſibilus aurae tenuis,</hi> as the vulgar hath it, and
in that voice the Lord appeared unto the Prophet,
and ſignified his will unto him. Which, as it doth
moſt excellently expreſſe the manner of Gods ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his people in the former times, ſo is it, as it
were, as hiſtory of thoſe wayes and means by which
the Lord hath ſpoke to us (to us particularly of this
Nation) in theſe latter dayes. The time was when
the Lord paſſed by us in a mighty wind, a wind that
blew down violently before it thoſe majeſtick ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
which had been conſecrated anciently to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
uſes and the ſervice of God, but ſure God was
not in that wind; next he paſſed by us in an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, an Earthquake or
Commotion as the vulgar reads it, by which the very
foundations of the State were almoſt utterly ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by rebellions, and the whole fabrick of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
diſſolved by potent factions, <hi>At non in
Commotione Dominus,</hi> but the Lord was not in that
Earthquake. <hi>Poſt commotionem Ignis,</hi> after the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
came a Fire, a cruel and devouring Fire, a Fire
more raging then the Babylonian Furnace, not heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for three onely but for thrice three hundred; a
Fire intended for the utter ruine of Gods Saints and
Servants, though it proved rather in the event a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Chariot, ſuch as was that provided for <hi>Elijah,</hi> for
their conveyance into Heaven, <hi>At non in igne Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
I am ſure God was not in that Fire. At laſt he
ſhewed himſelf unto us <hi>in ſibilo aurae tenuis,</hi> in a ſtill
ſmall voice; a voice of comfort and of conſolation,
a voice which for theſe eighty years hath ſpoken far
better things unto us then the blood of <hi>Abel:</hi> a voice
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:168623:206"/>
which we muſt hearken to with fear and reverence,
as did <hi>Elijah</hi> to that ſtill ſmall voice which appeared
unto him, as being <hi>vox Dei</hi> there, and <hi>vox mea</hi> here,
no difference at all between them.</p>
            <p>But what may ſome men chance to ſay, How ſhall
we know whether the voice that ſpeaks unto us, and
which we go ſo greedily to hear, be the <hi>vox mea</hi> of
the Text, ſince every one pretends to the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and hath a <hi>dixit Dominus</hi> in his mouth, be
he who he will? The readieſt way to ſatisfie this
doubt, is to look back upon the ſtory of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and
reſolve our ſelves: for if the Preacher ſpeak unto you
in a ſtill ſmall voice, if he deliver nothing to you but
the truth with ſoberneſs,<note place="margin">Acts 26.</note> 
               <hi>verba veritatis &amp; ſobrietatis</hi>
as the Apoſtle calls them, then doubt you not but
God is preſent in that voice, and tis your Chriſtian
duty to give ear unto it: but if he ſpeak unto you in
Fires and Earthquakes, in Storms and Tempeſts, or
like the ſons of <hi>Boanerges</hi> call for fire from Heaven,
it is a ſhrewd conjecture that God is not there. Thoſe
voices ſavour of a different ſpirit from the Lord our
Sheepherd, whoſe lips dropped Myrrhe, who ſpake
unto his people in ſo mild a way, that his reproofs
were gentle, his corrections ſweet. No Fire, nor
Storm, nor Earthquake in that ſacred voice wherein
he ſpeaks unto his Flocks, nor can it ſtand indeed with
his paſtoral Office, or with the ſafety of his ſheep that
it ſhould be otherwiſe. The ſheep is naturally of a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
and weak condition, eaſily frighted from
their food ſhould they be terrified with the cries of
Wolves, though falſe and counterfeit; or the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
barking of the dogs, though perhaps their own.
In which regard the Poets often repreſent the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:168623:207"/>
Sheepherd with his pipe and ſongs, and his flocks
feeding round about him, <hi>Stant &amp; oves circum, &amp;c.</hi>
Such is the voice we are to hear, a ſtill ſilent voice,
<hi>vox aurae lenis,</hi> or <hi>ſib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lus aurae tenuis,</hi> a ſtill ſmall
voice, a voice proceeding from a meek and humble
ſpirit: and yet it is not <hi>vox &amp; preterea nihil,</hi> not a
bare voice onely which we are to hear, but there's a
guide alſo whom we are to follow; <hi>audire vocem ejus</hi>
will not ſerve the turn, if we do not <hi>ſequi.</hi> The voice
but leads us on to him whom we ought to follow,
and we are bound to hear his voice for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but that we may the better know how to follow
him, my next particular and very briefly to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oves meae vocem meam audiunt, &amp; ſequuntur me,
my ſheep hear my voice and they follow me, i. e.</hi> they do
ſo hear his voice as to follow him. They ſtand not
gazing after him like men aſtoniſhed, as did the men
of <hi>Galilee</hi> at his aſcention, or as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did upon <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>
at his aſſumption, but are ſtill going and in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if they follow him. And if we follow him as we
ought to do, in all the paths of piety and vertue
which he hath pleaſed to lead before us, we ſhall be
hearers of his voice, there's no doubt of that, and
hearers of it to the purpoſe. And I ſaid well, if we do
follow him through all the paths of piety and vertue
which he hath pleaſed to lead before us: for many
things our Saviour did, in which it is impoſſible we
ſhould follow him; or elſe not neceſſary if we could.
Miracles, and ſuch works of wonder as he wrought
daily by the power of his Divinity, are objects of our
Faith onely and our admiration; and in theſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
follow him. Particular actions, whether of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:168623:207"/>
as his ſitting whilſt he taught the people; or
Circumſtance, as his adminiſtring the Sacrament in
an upper Chamber, are left arbitrary; and in theſe
we need not follow him. But in all Morall duties
whatſoever, as Prayer, and Faſting, and Alms-deeds,
in pardoning ſuch offences as are done unto us, and
humbling our ſelves under the mighty hand of God;
in theſe he hath commanded an obedient imitation,
and in all thoſe we ought to follow him.</p>
            <p>If therefore Chriſt hath taken up his Croſſe, and
is gone before us, it is no ſmall part of our obedience
to take up our Croſſes alſo,<note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> and to follow after. <hi>Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet
primum haec pati, we must firſt ſuffer all theſe things,
Afflictions, Perſecutions, Buffetings, Revilings, yea and
Death it ſelf before we enter into glory.</hi> As he hath led
the way before us in all the works of Godlineſs and
the fruits of Mercy, what better can become us then
to do ſo too? to tread in his moſt ſacred ſteps as he
makes us able: Himſelf hath ſo commanded, and we
muſt obey,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Be ye followers of God as dear children,</hi>
ſaith the great Apoſtle, <hi>i. e.</hi> as children love to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the geſtures, ſpeech, and other actions of their
Parents, ſo muſt we follow the example of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father,<note place="margin">Virgil.</note> 
               <hi>ſequimurque patrem non paſsibus aequis.</hi>
St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the ſelf ſame purpoſe, that Chriſt hath
left us an example,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 21.</note> 
               <hi>ut ſequamur veſtigia ejus,</hi> that we
ſhould follow his ſteps. And though St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth
in another place exhort thoſe of <hi>Corinth</hi> that they
ſhould be followers of him,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 1.</note> yet he ſubjoyned this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
<hi>ſicut ego Chriſti, as I am of Chriſt.</hi> Were it
not for this tie, <hi>ſicut ego Christi,</hi> we might be Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
in our youth, and Perſecutors in our age, (as too
many have been) and juſtifie our ſelves in both by
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:168623:208"/>
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> example. So that however that of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
be exceeding true,<note place="margin">Claudum.</note> 
               <hi>vivitur exemplo melius,</hi> that
men are guided eaſier by example then they are by
precept, yet it concerns us all to be very careful in
chooſing of the patterns which we mean to imitate;
and not to follow any man how great ſoever, further
then he doth follow Chriſt the chief Lord of all.</p>
            <p>And certainly our Saviour did not limit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
this duty, and tie it to himſelf alone without
ſpecial reaſon. He knew, none better, the faulty hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the ſheep; how apt they are (out of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
inclination) to run that way which ſome of their
unruly fellows have firſt led before them, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the direction of their Sheepherd, and many
times to their own ruine and deſtruction. <hi>Ubi mares

               <hi>reliquus grex facilè ſequetur. Ariſtotle</hi>
long ago did obſerve this in them, in his <hi>Hiſtoria Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malium,</hi>
and it holds good ſtill in our own obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thus is it alſo with us men, we are all apt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
bad example, eſpecially the example of ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Bell-wether; and few there are which are not
very much in love with the faults and errors of their
betters: which as it may adviſe all thoſe of more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
ranck, to have a ſpecial care of their wayes
and actions, becauſe their actions many times are
made exemplary, ſo may it leſſen thoſe of the lower
ſort, that to be governed by the example of frail ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
men, is at the beſt a ſimple and ſheepiſh quality.
<hi>O Imitatores ſtultum pecus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Horat.</note> ſaid the Poet truely, the
reaſon is becauſe the beſt men have been guilty of
notorious crimes, and therefore ſhould we make their
lives a general pattern unto ours, we may be drunk
with <hi>Noah,</hi> and inceſtuous with <hi>Lot,</hi> ſwearers with
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:168623:208"/>
               <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Murderers with <hi>David,</hi> Idolaters with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
Perſecutors with <hi>Paul,</hi> Deniers of the Lord
with <hi>Peter,</hi> and indeed what not. 'Tis not <hi>ſequuntur</hi>
then which is here commanded, an art of Imitation
onely which is here required, for then our Saviour
had not told us in their commendation, <hi>Alienum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
non ſequuntur,</hi> that they would not follow after
ſtrangers. 'Tis the word <hi>me</hi> that makes all ſure, the
following of the Lord our Sheepherd, and of none
but him, which in the end will bring us unto life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.
He is the carkaſe which is gone before us, and
we the Eagles that muſt follow after him, and follow
after him to that place where our reward is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and provided for us: For doubt we not but if we
follow our moſt gracious Sheepherd in all thoſe paths
of grace and godlineſs which he hath gone before us
in this preſent world, but we ſhall alſo follow the
Lamb whether ſoever he ſhall go in the world to
come.</p>
            <p>And yet I muſt not leave my Text: there is one
word more to be conſidered, and ſuch a word as is of
ſpecial uſe and efficacy to move vs to the following
of our Saviour, and of none but him, and this is <hi>Et
cognoſco eas,</hi> and I know the ſheep. A knowledge
not in general onely, how many and how fat they
are, of what ſize and colour, which every one may
quickly know as well as he, but a particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their ſeveral ſtates, of their ſtrength or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe,
how they have proſpered in his paſtures, to
what infirmities they are ſubject, and the way to
cure them. A knowledge ſo exact and punctual, as
to know them every one by name, <hi>&amp; proprias oves
vocat nominatim,</hi> he calls them every one by name,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:168623:209"/>
in the third of this Chapter; ſuch as aſcertains
them of his favour here and his glories hereafter.
For <hi>Dominus novit qui ſunt ſui, The Lord knows who

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as the Greek text hath it, the ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the ſeal of our Chriſtian hope; the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
if I may ſo call it, of the heavenly ſheepherd:
more then this yet: It is a knowledg which begets a
mutual confidence and acquaintance in and with one
another: <hi>I am the good ſheepherd and know my ſheep,
and am known of mine,</hi> ver. 14. He knows them ſo
as to take ſpecial notice of them, and to obſerve
whether they follow him or not, as they ought to
do. Not one of them can go aſtray but his eye is
on him, nor hide himſelf ſo cloſely that he cannot
find him; and having found him at the laſt, will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bring him back to the fold in triumph, or leave
him if he find no hope of his reduction, with
ſome brand or other that all the reſt may be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
to forbear his company. And they ſo
know him on the other ſide as to reſt aſſur'd that he
will lead them in no other paths then the <hi>paths of
righteouſneſſe,</hi> nor conduct them unto any other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
then the green <hi>paſtures of the Word,</hi> or drive
them to any other waters then the <hi>waters of comfort,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalme 24.</note>
whereof <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks. No Vallie of the ſhadow of
Death, no dreadful Precipice, no dangerous or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
walk to be feared at all, if we take care
to follow him: they are all ſure enough of that,
and this aſſurance doth proceed from <hi>cognoſco eas,</hi>
that knowledg which he is pleaſed to take of his
ſheep particularly, and to vouchſafe them of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:168623:209"/>
and his favours towards them. Follow him then
we may with ſafety, for he will lead us onely in the
way to Heaven; and follow him we muſt with
care, for he takes notice of our wandrings, of going
aſtray; and follow him we muſt both with hope and
confidence, for he knows our frailty, and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
us of all neceſſaries for ſo long a journey. And
then we may be ſure of this, that as we do our beſt
to follow him in the paths of righteouſneſs, ſo he
will do his part (for he knows our hearts) that Grace
and Mercy ſhall attend us in the courſe of this life,

had not that eſteem for <hi>quotations</hi> to the contrary,
which he had for theſe: not that he is much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed
through <hi>prejudice,</hi> but upon an <hi>old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
conſideration,</hi> that <hi>records</hi> and <hi>preſidents</hi>
differing from the <hi>received ways</hi> and <hi>intereſts</hi> of
men, are more to be regarded from any that make
for them; ſince the <hi>forgeryes</hi> and <hi>falſifications</hi> of
precedent Ages make it propable, that <hi>ſuch paſſages</hi>

might be <hi>inſerted and foyſted in,</hi> but <hi>why</hi> or <hi>how</hi>
theſe ſhould be <hi>adulterated</hi> he did not ſee. Even in
matters of common tranſaction, in our <hi>Engliſh
Courts</hi> of judicature, he thought he had been told,
that one <hi>precedent</hi> or <hi>verdict</hi> againſt the <hi>juri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of a <hi>Court</hi> is of more <hi>validity</hi> than a <hi>thouſand</hi>
for it: becauſe it is ſuppoſed that none will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to right and equity, infringe their own power.
Further; if any ſhould oppoſe the <hi>ſayings</hi> of others
in the behalf of <hi>humane learning,</hi> to what he had
<hi>vouched,</hi> he hoped they would produce them out
of Authors <hi>contemporaries</hi> with his, or elſe they
ſhould not imagine that he would think any ſuch
<hi>averrements</hi> to be <hi>contradictory</hi> to what his <hi>query</hi>
may <hi>ſeemingly aſſert,</hi> nor yet <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> to the
<hi>queſtion,</hi> nor doth he think (and. <hi>Heraldus, Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelius</hi>
and others concurr with him herein) that
out of <hi>Antiquty</hi> they can alledg any ſuch quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
If they <hi>oppoſe</hi> his <hi>query</hi> with the practiſe
and uſe of <hi>humane learning</hi> which is found in
<hi>Clem. Alexandr. Orig. Tertullian, Lactantius,
Arnobius, Minucius Felix, &amp;c.</hi> He ſhall not
think ſuch dealing to be fair: ſince the queſtion is
<hi>what was their judgment?</hi> not <hi>what they did
practiſe?</hi> Of the latter no man will ſuppoſe the
<hi>queriſt</hi> to be ignorant; and if any ſhould, yet
<pb facs="tcp:168623:212"/>
would the <hi>Objection</hi> be of no value, untill they
ſhall evince that every man did in thoſe times
<hi>live up to the light he had;</hi> and <hi>acted as he ſpake.</hi>
He thinks it may have been with the <hi>Ancients</hi> as
with [<hi>Vega</hi>] that excellent <hi>methodeſt in Phyſick,</hi>
who being ſick of a feavour, a friend viſited him, &amp;
found him drinking <hi>wine;</hi> whereupon he charged
him with having formerly prohibited the uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in feavours by his writings: The <hi>infirme</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>in my books you ſee the practiſe of Phyſick,
but in me the practiſe of Phyſicians.</hi> He ſuppoſes
that after perſons have been brought over from
<hi>Paganiſme</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſomething may ſtick by
them, as an ill ſcent may when one comes out of a
<hi>jakes,</hi> yet that is their <hi>failing,</hi> not their <hi>juſtification.</hi>
If <hi>Moſes</hi> learnt the <hi>Egyptian skill,</hi> it was whilſt
he remained in <hi>Pharaoh's Court:</hi> And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> was
learned in <hi>Heathen Authors,</hi> but it was before he
came to the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he hath uſed them
but <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> times in his works, whereas now
they are more frequent than <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi>
againſt the Gentiles, ſaith <hi>the Scriptures
are ſufficient to declare the truth of themſelves;</hi>
and that if his friend <hi>Macarius</hi> did read other <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi>
writers, It was but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>as a lover

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>legance,</hi> not <hi>as a lover of Chriſt.</hi> Other
<pb facs="tcp:168623:212"/>
things there were which he ſaw might be objected,
which he will not now inſiſt upon, having weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in the ballances and found them light. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>call of the Miniſtry</hi> and the <hi>firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi>
he hopes not to be oppoſed with the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgment
of <hi>Luther,</hi> or the reſt. He is not of their
<hi>Opinion,</hi> who thinke the firſt <hi>reformers</hi> did uſe
that <hi>Artifice</hi> of bending a crooked ſtick, as much
the other way, that ſo it may at leaſt become <hi>ſtraight.</hi>
Such dealings are not to be admitted in the ſervice
of our <hi>God,</hi> who is a <hi>conſuming fire:</hi> It is to
charge them with a great <hi>hypocriſie</hi> (ſince they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
owned any <hi>ſuch actions,</hi> but delivered all as
precious and glorious Truths) and to make them
guilty of the ruine of thoſe <hi>poor ſouls,</hi> who dyed
in the profeſſion of a belief their teachers did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
them. In fine, it is to make the <hi>firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
as bad (or not much better) a way as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
of Popery, and all that embraces it, and adhere
thereunto, to be in a different only, and <hi>ſinfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</hi>
It is a ſlur to the greateſt wonder God hath
produced after the <hi>Churches</hi> being 1200. years in
the <hi>Wilderneſs:</hi> How much more ought we to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
all <hi>ſucceeding times</hi> from their Doctrines?
and having ſuch pregnant motives to believe they
were <hi>ſpirited</hi> by God, let us impute their after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
<pb facs="tcp:168623:213"/>
to failings upon carnall conſiderations,
when <hi>Luther</hi> went to ſettle himſelf <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and his <hi>writings</hi> were advanced as the
<hi>teſt</hi> of <hi>truth;</hi> and an <hi>Oligarchy</hi> of <hi>Miniſters</hi>
ſetled elſewhere. Let us owe our <hi>Reformation</hi> to
God and not <hi>Belial</hi> or Antichriſt, to the <hi>call</hi> and
<hi>excitement</hi> of the <hi>former,</hi> not <hi>conſecration</hi> of the
<hi>latter.</hi> Let us acknowledge their <hi>zeal,</hi> their <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi>
&amp; thoſe more glorious principles of <hi>ſpirituall
graces,</hi> rather than <hi>prudentiall contrivements.</hi> Are
not thoſe there <hi>firſt works</hi> which are here <hi>quoted?</hi>
are not thoſe the works by which <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid he
would have men and Angels tryed? If you ſay, that
there is a difference betwixt a <hi>Church</hi> ſetled and
unſetled: a queſtion will ariſe (if that can be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned)
<hi>whether the Papiſts did not ſay their</hi> church
<hi>was then ſetled?</hi> and whether any ſettlement poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
will ſuffice to debarr thoſe actings? for then
the firſt Reformers, yea, firſt Chriſtians, and Chriſt
himſelf, all are caſt. If only what is a ſettlement of
<hi>truth,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel</hi>-ſettlement be intended, doth not
this reſolve all into a tryall of doctrines? &amp; a proof
that the preſent way is the ſole Goſpel-way? Which
whoſoever ſhall avow, he need not want employment
for his thoughts from the ſeverall writings of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
Epiſcoparians, Presbyterians, Independents,</hi>
&amp;c. however the <hi>Queſtioniſt ſhould reſt.</hi>
