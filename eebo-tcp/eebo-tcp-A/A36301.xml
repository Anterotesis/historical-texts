            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93653:5"/>
will take most dyes: so in Men, they that have the most reason are the most inalterable in their designes, and the darkest or most ignorant, do seldomest change; therfore Women changing more than Men, have also more <hi>Reason.</hi> They cannot be immutable like stocks, like stones, like the Earths dull Center; Gold that lyeth still, rusteth; Water, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; Aire that moveth not, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth; then why should that which is the perfection of other things, be imputed to Women as greatest imperfection? Because thereby they deceive Men. Are not your wits pleased with those jests, which cozen your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? You can cal it pleasure to be beguil'd in troubles, and in the most excellent toy in the world, you call it Treachery: I would you had your <hi>Mistresses</hi> so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, that they would never change, no not so much as their <hi>smocks,</hi> then should you see what sluttish vertue, <hi>Constancy</hi> were. <hi>Inconstancy</hi> is a most commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93653:5"/>
and cleanly quality, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in this quality are far more absolute than the Heavens, than the Stars, Moon, or any thing beneath it; for long observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath pickt certainty out of their mutability. The Learned are so well acquainted with the Stars, Signes and Planets, that they make them but Characters, to read the meaning of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in his own forehead. Every simple fellow can bespeak the change of the <hi>Moon</hi> a great while beforehand: but I would fain have the learnedst man so skilfull, as to tell when the simplest Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man meaneth to vary. Learning affords no rules to know, much less knowledge to rule the minde of a Woman. For as <hi>Philosophy</hi> teacheth us, that <hi>Light things do always tend upwards,</hi> and <hi>heavy things decline downward;</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth us otherwise, that the disposition of a <hi>Light</hi> Woman, is to fall down, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of women being contrary to all Art and Nature. Women


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93653:6"/>
are like <hi>Flies,</hi> which feed among us at our Table, or <hi>Fleas</hi> sucking our very blood, who leave not our most retired places free from their familiarity, yet for all their fellowship will they never be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nor commanded by us. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are like the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently carried one way, yet hath a proper course contrary: so though they, by the mastery of some over-ruling churlish hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, are forced to his Byas, yet have they a motion of their own, which their husbands never know of: It is the nature of nice and fastidious mindes to know things only to be wary of them: Women by their slye <hi>changeableness,</hi> and pleasing dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness, prevent even the mislike of those, for they can never be so well known, but that there is still more unknown. Every woman is a <hi>Science;</hi> for he that plods upon a woman all his life long, shall at length finde himself short of the knowledge of her: they are born to take down the pride


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93653:6"/>
of wit, and ambition of wisdom, making <hi>fools</hi> wise in the adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to win them, <hi>wisemen</hi> fools in conceit of losing their labours; witty men stark mad, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with their uncertainties. <hi>Philosophers</hi> write against them for spight, not desert, that having attained to some knowledge in all other things, in them only they know nothing, but are meerly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant: <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Experienced</hi> men rail against them, because they love in their liveless and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit age, when all goodness leaves them. These envious <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers</hi> ballad against them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause having nothing in themselvs able to deserve their love, they maliciously discommend all they cannot obtain, thinking to make men believe they know much, because they are able to dispraise much, and rage against <hi>Inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> when they were never admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into so much favour as to be forsaken. In mine opinion such men are happie that women are <hi>Inconstant,</hi> for so may they chance


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93653:7"/>
to be beloved of some excellent woman when it comes to their turn out of their <hi>Inconstancy</hi> and mutability, though not out of their own desert. And what reason is there to clog any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with one man, be he never so singular? Women had rather, and it is far better and more Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to enjoy all the vertues in several men, than but some of them in one, for otherwise they lose their taste, like divers sorts of meat minced together in one dish: and to have all excellencies in one man (if it were possible) is <hi>Confusion</hi> and <hi>Diversity.</hi> Now who can deny, but such as are obstinately bent to undervalue their worth, are those that have not soul enough to comprehend their excellency, women being the most excellent Creatures, in that man is able to subject all things else, and to grow wise in every thing, but still persists a fool in woman? The greatest <hi>Scholler,</hi> if he once take a wife, is found so unlearned, that he


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93653:7"/>
must begin his <hi>Horn-book,</hi> and all is by <hi>Inconstancy.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore; this name of <hi>Inconstancy,</hi> which hath so much been poysoned with slanders, ought to be changed into <hi>variety,</hi> for the which the world is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, <hi>and a woman for that the most delightfull thing in this world.</hi>

Nor doth it only draw the busie Eyes, but it is subject to the divinest touch of all, to <hi>kissing,</hi> the strange and mystical union of souls. If she should prostitute her self to a more unworthy man than thy self, how earnestly and justly wouldst thou exclaim? that for want of this easier and ready way of repairing, tobetray her body to ruine and deformity (the tyrannous <hi>Ravishers,</hi> and sodain <hi>Deflourers</hi> of all women) what a hainous adultery is it? What thou lovest in her <hi>face</hi> is <hi>colour,</hi> and <hi>painting</hi> gives that, but thou hatest it, not because it is, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou knowest it. Fool, whom ignorance makes happy, the Stars, the Sun, the Skye whom thou admirest, alas, have no <hi>colour,</hi> but are fair, because they seem to be coloured: If this seeming will not satisfie thee in her, thou hast good assurance of


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93653:8"/>
her <hi>colour,</hi> when thou seest her lay it on. If her <hi>face</hi> be <hi>painted</hi> on a Board or Wall, thou wilt love it, and the Board, and the Wall: Canst thou loath it then when it speaks, smiles, and kisses, because it is <hi>painted?</hi> Are we not more delighted with seeing Birds, Fruits, and Beasts <hi>painted</hi> then we are with Naturals? And do we not with pleasure behold the <hi>painted</hi> shape of Monsters and Devils, whom true, we durst not regard? We repair the ruines of our houses, but first cold tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests warns us of it, and bites us through it; we mend the wrack and stains of our apparel, but first our eyes, and other bodies are offended; but by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Women, this is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. If in <hi>Kissing</hi> or <hi>breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> upon her, the <hi>painting</hi> fall off, thou art angry, wilt thou be so, if it stick on? Thou didst love her, if thou beginnest to hate her, then 'tis because she is not <hi>painted.</hi> If thou wilt say now, thou didst hate her before, thou

be <hi>more common then Evil,</hi> because it hath this for nature and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to be common. It makes <hi>Love</hi> to all <hi>Natures,</hi> all, all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. So that in the worlds early Infancy, there was a time when nothing was evil, but if this world shall suffer dotage in the extreamest crookedness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there shall be no time when nothing shall be good. It dares appear and spread, and glister in the world, but evil buries it self in night and darkness, and is chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised and suppressed when good is cherished and rewarded And as <hi>Imbroderers, Lapidaries,</hi> and other <hi>Artisans,</hi> can by all things adorn their works; for by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding better things, the better they shew in Lush and in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency; so good doth not only prostrate her amiableness to all, but refuses no end, no not of her utter contrary evil, that she may be the more common to us. For evil manners are parents of good Laws; and in every evil there is an excellency, which (in common


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93653:11"/>
speech) we call good. For the fashions of habits, for our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in gestures, for phrases in our speech, we say they were good as long as they were used, that is as long as they were common; and we eat, we walk, only when it is, or seems good to do so. All <hi>fair,</hi> all <hi>profitable,</hi> all <hi>vertuous,</hi> is, <hi>good,</hi> and these three things I think imbrace all things, but their utter contraries; of which also <hi>fair</hi> may be <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; poor</hi> may be <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>fair; vitious</hi> may be <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>rich;</hi> so that <hi>good</hi> hath this good means to be <hi>common,</hi> that some subjects she can possess intirely; and in subjects poysoned with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, she can humbly stoop to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the evil. And of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things many things are become perfectly good by being common, as <hi>customs</hi> by use are made binding Laws.

alas! how unable a guide is that which follows the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of our slimie bodies? for we cannot say that we derive our inclinations, our minds, or souls from our Parents by any way: to say that it is all from all, is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in reason, for then with the first nothing remains, or is a part from all, is error in experience, for then this part equally impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to many children, would like Gavel-kind lands, in few genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions become nothing: or to say it by communication, is error in <hi>Divinity,</hi> for to communicate the <hi>ability</hi> of communicating <hi>whole essence</hi> with any but God, is utter <hi>blasphemy.</hi> And if thou hit thy <hi>Fathers nature</hi> and <hi>inclination,</hi> he also had his <hi>Fathers,</hi> and so climbing up, all comes of one man, and have one <hi>nature,</hi> all shall imbrace one course; but that cannot be, therefore our <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions</hi> and whole <hi>bodies,</hi> we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit from <hi>Parents;</hi> our <hi>inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and minds follow that: For our minde is heavy in our <hi>bodies

                        <hi>PAracelsus</hi> perchance saith true, That every Disease hath his Exaltation in some part cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. But why this in the Nose? Is there so much mercy in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, that it provides that one should not smell his own stinck? Or hath it but the common for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that being begot and bred in obscurest and secretest places, because therefore his serpentine crawling and insinuation should not be suspected, nor seen, he comes soonest into great place, and is more able to destroy the worthiest member, then a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease better born? Perchance as mice defeat Elephants by knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Proboscis,</hi> which is their Nose, this wretched Indian Vermine practiseth to doe the same upon us. Or as the ancient furious Custome and Connivency of some Lawes, that one might cut off their Nose whome he depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93653:32"/>
in Adulterie, was but a Tipe of this; And that now more charitable lawes having taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all Revenge from particular hands, this common Magistrate and Executioner is come to doe the same Office invisibly? Or by withdrawing this conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part, the Nose, it warnes us from all adventuring upon that Coast; for it is as good a marke to take in a flag as to hang one out. Possibly heate, which is more potent and active then cold, thought her selfe injured, and the Harmony of the world out of tune, when cold was able to shew the high-way to Noses in <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> except she found the meanes to doe the same in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Or because by the consent of all, there is an Analogy, Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and affection between the Nose and that part where this disease is first contracted, and therefore <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabalus</hi> chose not his Minions in the Bath but by the Nose; And <hi>Albertus</hi> had a knavish meaning when he preferd great Noses;


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93653:33"/>
And the licentious Poet was <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Poeta.</hi> I think this reason is nearest truth, That the Nose is most compassionate with this part: Except this be nearer, that it is reasonable that this Disease in particular should affect the most eminent and perspicuous part, which in general doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to take hold of the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and conspicuous men.</p>

The Ape brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth her young, for the most part by twins; that which she loves best, she killeth by pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it too hard: so foolish maids soothing themselves with a false conceit of <hi>vertue,</hi> in fond obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie, live and die maids; and so not onely kill in themselves the <hi>vertue</hi> of <hi>Virginity,</hi> and of a <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> make it a <hi>Vice,</hi> but they also accuse their parents in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning marriage.

From this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of an Ape &amp; an old Maid did the foresaid proverb first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise. But alas, there are some old Maids that are <hi>Virgins</hi> much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their wills, and fain would change their <hi>Virgin-life</hi> for a <hi>Married:</hi> such if they never have had any offer of fit Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, are in some sort excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and their willingnesse, their desire to marry, and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance from all dishonest, and unlawfull copulation, may be a kind of inclination to <hi>vertue,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not <hi>Vertue</hi> it selfe.

Avarice is the greatest deadly sin next Pride: it takes more pleasure in hoording Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure then in making use of it, and will neither let the possessor nor others take benefit by it during the Misers life; yet it remains intire, and when the Miser dies most come to som body. <hi>Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> ever kept, is a vice far wors then Avarice, it will neither let the possessor nor others take benefit by it, nor can it be bequeathed to any: with long keeping it decayes and withers, and becomes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and nothing worth.

In the twinckling of an eye, I saw all the roomes in Hell open to my sight. And by the benefit of certain spectacles, I know not of what making, but I thinke, of the same, by which <hi>Gregory</hi> the great and <hi>Beda</hi> did discerne so distinctly the soules of their friends, when they were discharged from their


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93653:59"/>
bodies and sometimes the soules of such men as they knew not by sight, and of some that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the world, and yet they could distinguish them flying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, or conversing with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men. I saw all the channels in the bowels of the Earth; and all the inhabitants of all nations, and of all ages were suddenly made familiar to mee. I thinke truly, <hi>Robert Aquinas</hi> when he <note place="margin">Paleotus de Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done cap. 6.</note> took <hi>Christ's</hi> long Oration, as he hung upon the Crosse, did use some such Instrument as this, but applyed to the eare: And so I <note place="margin">Iosephina di Gieron Gratian.</note> thinke did he, which dedicated to <hi>Adrian</hi> 6. that Sermon which <hi>Christ</hi> made in praise of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ioseph:</hi> for else how did they heare that, which none but they ever heard? As for the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of Hel (I mean both <hi>Limbo</hi> and <hi>Purgatory)</hi> I must confess I pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them over so negligently, that I saw them not: and I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly carried, to finde new places, never discovered before. For <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> did not seem worthy to


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93653:59"/>
me of much diligence, because it may seem already to have been beleeved by some persons, in some corners of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> for about 50 yeares; that is ever since the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> had a minde to fulfill the prophecies of <hi>Homer, Virgil,</hi> and the other <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks</hi> of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and being not satisfied with making one <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> purposed to bring in another: which is, to change <hi>Fables</hi> into <hi>Articles</hi> of Faith. Proceeding therefore to more inward places, I saw a secret place, where there were not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, beside <hi>Lucifer</hi> himselfe; to which, onely they had title, which had so attempted any innovation in this life, that they gave an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to all Antiquity, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced doubts, and anxieties, and scruples, and after a libertie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving what they would, at length established opinions, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to all established before. Of which place in <hi>Hell,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Theod: Ni em: nemus unio, Tra. 6. cap. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Lucifer</hi> afforded us hertofore some little knowledge, when more

then 200. yeares since, in an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle</hi> written to the <hi>Cardinall S. Sexti,</hi> he promised him a roome <hi>in his palace, in the remotest part of his eternall Chaos,</hi> which I take to be this place. And here Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> seemed to contend about the highest room. He gloried of having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled an old Religion, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> of having brought in a new; each of them a great deluge to the world. But it is to be feared, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> will fail therein, both because he attributed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the old <hi>Testament,</hi> and because he used <hi>Sergius</hi> as his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Bishop, in making the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran;</hi> whereas it was evident to the supreme Judge <hi>Lucifer,</hi> (for how could he be ignorant of that which himselfe had put into the Popes minde?) that <hi>Boniface</hi> had not only neglected, but destroyed the policy of the State of <hi>Israel,</hi> established in the old <hi>Testament,</hi> when he prepared <hi>Popes</hi> a way, to tread upon the necks of <hi>Princes,</hi> but that he also abstained from al


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93653:60"/>
Example and Coadjutor, when he took upon him that new name, which <hi>Gregory</hi> himselfe (a Pope neither very foolish, nor overmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest) ever abhord. Besides that every day affords new Advocates to <hi>Boniface</hi> his side. For since the <hi>Franciscans</hi> were almost worne out (of whom their General <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sedulius Apolog. pro libro Con form. l. 2. cap. 2.</note> had seen 6000, Souldiers in one army, that is, in one Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) which, because they were then but fresh Souldiers, he saw assisted with 18000 <hi>Devils;</hi> the <hi>Iesuits</hi> have much recompenced those decaies and damages, who sometimes have maintained in <note place="margin">Harlay defence des Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites.</note> their Tents, 200000 Schollers. For though the Order of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> have ever been so fruitful, that they say of it, <hi>That all the new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vollader: deCanoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za Fran cis Ro. in Epist.</note> 
                     <hi>which in latter times have broken out, are but little springs, or drops, and that Order the Ocean, which hath sent out 52 Popes, 200 Cardinals, 1600 Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, 4000 Bishops, and 5000 Saints, approved by the Church,</hi> and therefore it cannot be denied,


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93653:61"/>
but that <hi>Boniface</hi> his part is much relieved by that Order; yet if they be compared to the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> or to the weak and unperfect types of them, the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> it is no great matter that they have done. Though therefore they esteem <hi>Mahomet</hi> worthy of the name of an <hi>Innovator,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in perchance not much inferior to <hi>Boniface,</hi> yet since his time, to ours, almost all which have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Though therefore it may religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and piously be beleeved, that <hi>Turks</hi> as well as <hi>Papists,</hi> come daily in Troops to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and common places of <hi>Hell;</hi> yet certainly to this more honorable room reserved for especiall <hi>Innovators,</hi> the <hi>Papists</hi>


                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:93653:61"/>
have more frequent accesse; and therefore <hi>Mahomet</hi> is out of hope to prevail, and must imitate the <hi>Christian Emperours,</hi> and bee content to sit (as yet he doth) at the <hi>Popes</hi> feet. Now to this place not onely such endeavour to come, as have <hi>Innovated</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters directly concerning the soul, but they also which have done so, either in the Arts, or in conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in any thing which exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth the faculties of the Soule, and may so provoke to quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and brawling controversies, for so the truth be lost, it is no no matter how.

it to one of so great ambitions, and undertakings: Nor did he think that himself had attempted greater matters before his fall. Somthing he had which he might have conveniently opposed, but he was loath to utter it, lest he should confesse his fear. But <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius Loyola</hi> which was got neer his chaire, a subtile fellow, and so indued with the Devill, that he was able to tempt, and not onely that, but (as they say) even to possesse the Devill, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended this perplexity in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer.</hi> And making himselfe sure of his own entrance, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, that many thousands of his family aspired to that place, he opposeth himself against all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He was content they should be damned, but not that they should govern. And though when he died he was utterly ignorant in all great learning, and knew not so much as <hi>Ptolomeys</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus</hi> name, but might have been perswaded that the words <hi>Almagest, Zenith,</hi> and <hi>Nadir,</hi>

Or do they out of this motion of the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is no hell, or deny the punishment of sin? Do not men believe? do they not live just as they did before? Besides, this detracts from the

dignity of your learning, and derogates from your right and title of coming to this place, that those opinions of yours, may very well be true. If therefore any man have honour or title to this place in this matter, it belongs wholly to our <hi>Clavins,</hi> who opposed himself opportunely against you, and the truth, which at that time was creeping into every mans minde.

                     <hi>Lucifer</hi> signified his assent: and <hi>Copernicus</hi> without muttering a word, was as quiet as he thinks the Sunne: when he which stood next him, entred into his place. To whom <hi>Lucifer</hi> said: And who are you? He answered, <q>Philippus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olus Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast of Hohenheim.</q> At this <hi>Lucifer</hi> trembled, as if it were a new <hi>Exorcîsme,</hi> and he thought it might well be the first verse of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> which is always imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelsus</hi> replyed, <q>It were an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to thee, O glorious <hi>Emperor,</hi> if I should deliver before thee what I have done, as though all those things had not proceeded from thee, which seemed to have bin done by me, thy organ and conduit; yet since I shal rather be thy trumpet herein then mine own, some things may be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me. Besides therefore that I brought all <hi>Methodicall Physicians</hi> and the Art it self into so much contempt, that that kinde of Physick is almost lost; this also was ever my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal purpose, that no certain new Art, nor fixed rules might be established, but that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies might be dangerously

And falling upon those times which did abound with paradox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icall and unusual diseases, of all which, the pox, which then began to rage, was almost the center and sink: I ever profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an assured and an easie cure thereof, lest I should deterr any from their licentiousness. And whereas almost all poysons are so disposed and conditioned by nature, that they offend some of the senses, and so are easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned and avoided, I brought it to pass, that that treacherous quality of theirs might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and so they might safely be given without suspicion, and yet perform their office as strongly. All this I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I wrought by thy minerals and by thy fires, but yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not despair of my reward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I was thy first minister and instrument in these innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>

By this time <hi>Ignatius</hi> had observed a tempest risen in <hi>Lucifers</hi> countenance: for he was just of the same temper as <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and therefore suffered with him in every thing, and felt all his alterations. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might deliver him from <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> he said; <q>You must not think sir, that you may here draw out an Oration to the proportion of your name. It must be confessed that you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted great matters, and well becoming a great officer of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer,</hi> when you undertook not only to make a man in your <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limbecks,</hi> but also to preserve him immortal.

                  <p>Content with this sentence, <hi>Paracelsus</hi> departed; and <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avel</hi> succeeded, who having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <hi>Ignatius</hi> his forwardness, and sauciness, and how, uncald,


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93653:69"/>
he had thrust himself into the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Kings-Attorney,</hi> thought this stupid patience of <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> and <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> (men which tasted too much of their <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)</hi> unfit for a <hi>Florentine:</hi> and therefore had provided some ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous darts, out of his <hi>Italian Arsenal,</hi> to cast against this worn souldier of <hi>Pampelune,</hi> this <hi>French-Spanish</hi> mungrell, <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius.</hi> But when he thought better upon it, and observed that <hi>Lucifer</hi> ever approved whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Ignatius</hi> said, he suddenly changed his purpose; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on another resolution, he determined to direct his speech to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as to the principall person next to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> as well by this means to sweeten and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie him, as to make <hi>Lucifer</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, that by these honours and specious titles offered to <hi>Ignatius</hi> and entertained by him, his own dignity might be eclipsed or clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and that <hi>Ignatius</hi> by win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his side politique men, exercised in civil businesses, might

attempt some innovation in that Kingdom. Thus therefore he began to speak. <q>Dread <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> and you, his watchfull and diligent <hi>Genius,</hi> father <hi>Ignatius, Arch-Chancellor</hi> of this <hi>Court,</hi> and highest <hi>Priest</hi> of this high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Synagogue</hi> (except the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> reach also unto this place) let me before I descend to myself, a little consider, speak, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire your stupendious wisdom, and the Government of this state. You may vouchsafe to remember great <hi>Emperor)</hi> how long after the <hi>Nazarens</hi> death, you were forced to live a solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a barren, and an Eremiticall life, till at last, as it was ever your fashion to imitate Heaven) out of your aboundant love, you begot this dearly beloved son of yours, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which stands at your right hand. And from both of you proceeds a spirit, whom you have sent into the world, who triumphing both with <hi>Mitre</hi> and <hi>Crown,</hi> governs


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93653:70"/>
your Militant Church there. As for those sons of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whom either he left alive, or were born after his death, and your spirit, the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> how justly and properly may they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led equivocall men? And not only equivocall in that sense, in which the <hi>Popes Legates,</hi> at your <hi>Nicene Councel</hi> were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Equivocal,</hi> because <hi>they did agree in all their opinions, and in all their words:</hi> but especially because they have brought into the world a new art of <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> O wonderfull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible <hi>Hypercritiques,</hi> who not out of marble fragments, but out of the secretest Records of Hell it self, that is, out of the minds of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> (persons truely equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocall) have raised to life again the language of the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> so long concealed, and brought us again from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing one another. For my part (O noble pair of <hi>Emperors)</hi> that I may freely confess the


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93653:70"/>
truth, all which I have done, wheresoever there shall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the Jesuits, can be reputed but childish, for this honour I hope will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me, that I brought in an <hi>Alphabet,</hi> and provided cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain elements, and was some kind of Schoolmaster in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them a way to higher undertakings; yet it grieves me and makes me ashamed that I should be ranked with this idle and Chymaericall <hi>Copernicus,</hi> or this cadaverous vulture, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelsus.</hi> I scorn that those gates into which such men could conceive any hope of entrance, should not voluntarily flye open to me: yet I can better endure the rashness and fellowship of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> then the other: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he having been conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently practised in the butcheries and mangling of men, he had the reason to hope for favour of the Jesuits: For I my self went always that way of blood, and therefore I did ever prefer the


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93653:71"/>
sacrifices of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and of the <hi>Iews,</hi> which were perfor med with effusion of bloud (whereby not only the people but the Priests also were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to bold enterprises) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the soft and wanton sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of <hi>Christians.</hi> If I might have had my choice, I should rather have wished that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> had taken the <hi>Bread</hi> than the <hi>Wine</hi> from the people, since in the wine there is some colour to imagin and represent blood. Neither did you (most reverend Bishop of this diocess <hi>Ignatius)</hi> abhor from this way of blood. For having conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated your first age to the wars, and grown, somewhat unable to follow that course by reason of a wound; you did present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begin to think seriously of a spiritual war against the <hi>Church</hi> and found means to open waies even into Kings chambers, for your executioners. Which dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity you did not reserve only to your own Order, but (though


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93653:71"/>
I must confes, that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the nourishment of this doctrine remains with you, and is peculiar to you, out of your infinite liberalitie,) you have vouchsafed sometime, to use the hands of other men in these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. And therefore as well they, who have so often in vain attempted it in <hi>England,</hi> as they which have brought their great purposes to effect in <hi>France,</hi> are indebted only to you for their courage and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. But yet although the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into this place may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to none, but to Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and to only such of them as have dealt in <hi>Christian</hi> busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and of them also, to those only which have had the fortune to doe much harme; I cannot see but that next to the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> I must be invited to enter, since I did not only teach those wayes by which, thorough <hi>perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and <hi>dissembling of Religion,</hi> a man might possesse and usurpe upon the liberty of free <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths;</hi>


                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:93653:72"/>
but also did arme and furnish the people with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, how when they were under this oppression, they might safeliest conspire, and remove a <hi>tyrant,</hi> or revenge themselves of their <hi>Prince</hi> and redeem their former losses; so that from both sides, both from <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> I brought an abundant har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, and a noble encrease to this kingdome.</q> By this time I perceived <hi>Lucifer</hi> to be much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with this Oration, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline much towards <hi>Machiavel;</hi> For he did acknowledge him to be a kind of <hi>Patriarke,</hi> of those whom they call <hi>Laymen.</hi> And he had long observed, that the <hi>Clergie</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> tumbled down to <hi>Hell</hi> daily, easily, voluntarily, and by troupes, because they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to sinn against their conscience, and knowledge; but that the <hi>Laitie</hi> sinning out of a sloathfulnesse, and negligence of finding the truth, did rather of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend by ignorance and omission. And therefore he thought himself


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93653:72"/>
bound to reward <hi>Machiavel,</hi> which had awakened this drowsie and implicite <hi>Laitie</hi> to greater, and more bloudie Vndertakings. Besides this, since <hi>Ignatius</hi> could not be denied the place, whose ambitions and turbulencies <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> understood very well, he thought <hi>Machiavel</hi> a fit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie Instrument to oppose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; that so the skales be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept even by their factions, he might govern in peace, and two poysons mingled might doe no harme. But he could not hide this intention from <hi>Ignatius,</hi> more subtil than the <hi>Devil</hi> and the verier <hi>Lucifer</hi> of the two: Therefore <hi>Ignatius</hi> rushed out, threw himselfe down at <hi>Lucifers</hi> feet, and groveling on the ground adored him. Yet certainly, <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> would not call this <hi>idolatry,</hi> because in the shape of the <hi>Devill</hi> he worshipped him, whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the true <hi>God.</hi> Here <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> cryed, and thundred out,
<q>
                        <l>With so great noise and horror,</l>
                        <l>That had that powder taken fire, by which</l>

All the Isle of Britain had flowne to the Moon,</l>
                        <l>It had not equalled this noyse and horror.</l>
                     </q>
And when he was able to speake distinctly, thus he spoke; <q>It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said (unspeakable <hi>Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our)</hi> how much this obscure <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> hath transgressed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, and against the <hi>Pope</hi> thy <hi>image-bearer,</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the word be accepted, as <note place="margin">Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</note>

farr from invoking you, or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to you, that he did not so much as acknowledge your kingdome nor beleeve that there was any such thing in Nature as you.

would have only lawfull for our <hi>Order</hi> to whom it is given to know times and secrets of state: for we see the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (which may seem to have an <hi>Aristocratical papacy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves) though they laboured to destroy the doctrin of <hi>Mariana,</hi> did yet wisely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to name him or any other <hi>Iesuit,</hi> which was a modesty that I did not hope for at their hands; since before I died they made one <hi>Decree</hi> against me: <note place="margin">Gretzer: Examen: speculi fol: 139.</note> but yet therein I think some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what may be attributed to my patience and providence; who knowing their strength and our own infancy, forbad all of my <hi>Order</hi> to make any answer to that <hi>Decree</hi> of theirs: neither were we so <hi>Herculean</hi> as to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to strangle Serpents in our cradle.

But we who have received the <hi>Church</hi> to be as a ship, do free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sail in the deep sea; we have


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93653:86"/>
an <hi>Ancor,</hi> but we have not cast it yet, but keep it ever in our power to cast it and weigh it at our pleasure. And we know well enough that as to sailing ships, so to our sailing Church, all rocks, all promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, all firm and fast places are dangerous, and threaten shipwrack, and therefore to be avoided; and liberty and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room to be affected; yet I do not obstinately say that there is nothing in <hi>Machiavels Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary</hi> which may be of use to this Church. Certainly there is very much; but we are not men of that poverty that we need beg from others, nor dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie those things with our praises which proceed not from our selves. The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> gave us heretofore a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of this temperance and abstinence, which therefore refused to place <hi>Christ</hi> amongst their <hi>gods,</hi> because the matter was proposed by the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and begun not in themselves.


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93653:86"/>
As for that Particular wherein <hi>Machiavel</hi> useth especially to glory; which is that he brought in the liberty of dissembling and lying, it hath neither foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation nor colour: For not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Plato</hi> and other fashioners of <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> allowed the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of lying to Magistrates <note place="margin">Observat: in Cassia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, fol: 736. ex collat: 19.</note> and to Physitians; but we also considering the Fathers of the Church, <hi>Origen, Chrysostome, Hierome,</hi> have not only found that Doctrin in them, but we have also delivered them from al imputation and reprehension by this evasion, <hi>That it was lawfull for them to maintain that opinion till some definition of the Church had established the contrary:</hi> Which certainly (though this should not be so openly spoken of) as yet was never done. But yet we have departed from this doctrin of free lying, though it were received in practice, excused by the Fathers, strengthened by examples of Prophets and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in the Scriptures, and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

Truly I thought this Oration of <hi>Ignatius</hi> very long: and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of my body which I had so long abandoned, lest it should putrifie, or grow mouldy, or be buried; yet I was loath to leave the Stage till I saw the Play ended. And I was in hope that if any such thing should befall my body, the Jesuits, who work <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> so familiarly, and whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation I was so carefull of in this matter, would take compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon me, and restore me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

                  <p>So I saw <hi>Machiavel</hi> often put forward, and often thrust back, and at last vanish.

This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he said to him: <q>I am sorry my <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that I can neither find in others, deserts worthy of this place, nor any room in this place worthy of your deserts.

                        <hi>Heaven,</hi> and thereby got this Empire, this may excuse you, that no man hath been able to tell you what it was: For if any of the <hi>Ancients</hi> say true when they call it <hi>Pride,</hi> or <hi>Licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> or <hi>Lying;</hi> or if it be in any of the <hi>Casuists,</hi> which professe the Art of sinning, you cannot be accused of having omitted it. But since I may neither forsake this <hi>kingdome,</hi> nor divide it, this only remedy is left: I will write to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he shall call <hi>Galilaeo</hi> the <hi>Florentine</hi> to him, who by this time bath throughly instructed himselfe of all the Hills, Woods, and Cities in the new world, the <hi>Moone.</hi> And since he effected so much with his first <hi>Glasses,</hi> that he saw the <hi>Moon</hi> in so neer a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that he gave himselfe sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all, and the least parts in her, when now being <note place="margin">Nuncius Sydereus.</note> grown to more perfection in his Art, he shall have made new <hi>Glasses</hi> and they received a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing from the <hi>Pope,</hi> he may

And with the same ease as you passe from the earth to the <hi>Moon,</hi> you may passe from the <hi>Moon</hi> to the other <hi>stars,</hi> which are also thought to be worlds, and so you may beget and propagate many <hi>Hels,</hi> and enlarge your <hi>Empire,</hi> and come neerer unto that high seate, which I left at first.</q> 
                     <hi>Ignatius</hi> had not the patience to stay till <hi>Lucifer</hi> had made an end; but as soon as he saw him pause, and


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93653:103"/>
take breath, and look, first upon his face, to observe what changes were there, and after to cast his eye to another place in <hi>Hell,</hi> where a great noyse was suddenly raysed: he apprehended this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission, and as though <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> had ended, he said: <q>That of <hi>Lucifers</hi> affection to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and to their <hi>Order,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day produced new Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and that this last was to be accounted as one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. That he knew well with how great devotion the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> did ever embrace and execute all councels proceding from him: And that therefore he hoped, that he would reserve that imployment for the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and that <hi>Empire</hi> for him their founder: and that he beleeved the <hi>Pope</hi> had thought of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and at that time when he put <hi>Parsons</hi> the <hi>English Iesuite</hi> in hope of a <hi>Cardinalship,</hi> he had certainely a reference to this place, and to this <hi>Church:</hi> That it would fall out shortly, that

all the dammages, which the <hi>Roman Church</hi> hath lately suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the earth, shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced only there. And that now this refuge was opened if she should be reduced into greater streights, or if she should be utterly exterminated, the world would not much lament and mourne for it. And for the entertainment of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> there, there can be no doubt made at this time, when, (although their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession be to enter whether Princes will or no) all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the World will not only graciously afford them leave to go, but willingly and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompany them with Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, and Demissory letters. nor would they much resist it, if the Pope himself would vouchsafe to go with them, and so fulfill in some small measure, that Prophecie of his <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, De Auferibilitate Papae.</hi> Besides this, a woman governs there; of which sex they have

though they themselves did not believe them, we have since found many truths, and many deep mysteries: nor can I call to minde any woman which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceived our hope, or esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped our cunning, but <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> who might the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be pardoned that, because she had put off all affections of women.

it was fit he should try what he could doe in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Now the <hi>Pope</hi> would fain have satisfied them with the Title of <hi>Beatus,</hi> which formerly upon the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Princes of that <hi>Family</hi> he had afforded to <hi>Aloisius Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga</hi>

For now he thought he might no longer doubt nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his admission, who, besides his former preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had now gotten a new right and Title to the place by his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization;</hi> and he feared that the <hi>Pope</hi> would take all delay ill at his hands, because <hi>Canonization</hi> is now grown a kind of <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by which all men may take knowledge, that such a one to whom the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is much beholden, is now made partaker of the principall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and places in <hi>Hell:</hi> For these men ever make as though they would follow <hi>Augustine</hi> in all things, and therfore they provide that that also shall be true which he said in this point, <hi>That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of many are honoured upon earth, whose souls are tormented in Hell.</hi> Therefore he took <hi>Ignatius</hi> by the hand, and led him to the Gate. In the mean time, I, which doubted of the truth of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his Canonizing, went a little out for further instruction:


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93653:110"/>
for I thought it scarce credible, that <hi>Paulus Quintus,</hi> who had but lately burdened both the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> with so great expences, when he canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed <hi>Francisca Romana,</hi> would so easily proceed to canonize <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> now, when neither any Prince offered to bear the charge, nor so much as sollicited it: for so he must be focred to wast both the <hi>Treasures of the Church</hi> at once. And from <hi>Leo</hi> 3. who 800 years after Christ, is the first <hi>Pope</hi> which canonized any, I had not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that this had ever been done: Neither doe I think that <hi>Paulus Quintus</hi> was drawn to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonizing of this woman by any other respect, then because that <hi>Rule</hi> which she appointed to her <hi>Order, was dictated and written by</hi>

glad to apprehend any thing of his new writing which might be for them, that so this new work of his might bear witness of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond conversion to <hi>Papistry,</hi> since by his first conversion to <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> they got nothing: for to say that in this business <hi>Paulus Quintus could not chuse but be God, God himselfe</hi> to say <hi>that he must needs have lived familiarly with the Godhead: and must have heard Predestination it self whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him: and must have had a place to sit in Councell with the most Divine Trinity,</hi> (all which <note place="margin">Fol. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Valaderius</hi> sayes of him, is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in this matter, wherein the Popes for the most part proceed, as humane affections lead them.

received it by his implicit faith, and published it. I laughed at <hi>Lucifers</hi> easinesse to beleeve, and I saw no reason ever after, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him of infidelity. Upon this I came back again, to spy (if the gates were still open) with what affection <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and they who were in ancient possession of that place, behaved themselves towards one another. And I found him yet in the porch, and there beginning a new contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for having presently cast his eyes to the principal place, next to <hi>Lucifers</hi> owne <hi>Throne;</hi> and finding it possest he stopt <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> and asked him who it was that sate there.

use that name? and that <hi>Gregory</hi> did not reprehend the <hi>Patriarch Iohn</hi> for taking to himself an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian name, but for usurping a name which was due to none but the <hi>Pope.</hi> And could it be fit for you, <hi>Lucifer</hi> (who in this were either unmindfull of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> or else too weak and incapable of her secrets and mysteries) to give way to any fentence in <hi>Hell,</hi> which (though it were according to truth) yet differed from the <hi>Iesuits Oracles?</hi> With this <hi>Ignatius</hi> flyes upwards, and rushes upon <hi>Boniface,</hi> and throwes him out of his Seat: and <hi>Lucifer</hi> went up with him as fast, and gave him assistance, lest, if he should forsake him, his own Seat might be indangered.
