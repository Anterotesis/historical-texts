            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now there bee two things more which must concurre to fit and enable a strong man to <hi>Sauls</hi> seruice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hee must be in relation to <hi>Saul.</hi> 2. Hee must bee disciplined to him. His relation to <note place="margin">1. <hi>Relation.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Saul,</hi> and tye, must be in. 1. Ciuill, 2. Diuine bands. The former requires him to be of the same countrey. The latter necessitateth him to be of the same true Religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Saul</hi> taketh in to him his owne natiues, and spyeth out fit men in his owne countrey and kingdome. And it is the wisedome of a Generall, if it be possible, to presse his souldiers out of the same countrey. For, 1. Natiues are absolutely subiect to the soueraigne power, and so by all lawes of God and nations vnder
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15280:8"/>
command; bee the seruice neuer so dangerous or vnpleasing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A domesticall souldier is in a nearer tye and bond to his countrey, his King, his kinred, and his owne fortunes. He is in the same boate which is tossed and threatned with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, and is someway interessed in the common cause, and quarrell; whereas a stranger may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <note place="margin">Mihi istic <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

And hence it is that from a curious or dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall souldier, his Commander may expect both fortitude and faith; in strangers it hath beene often obseruable, that though they <note place="margin">Etiamsi iis pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritia <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

            <p n="3">3. It cannot but make him more carefull and faithfull abroad, when he is lyable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or punishment, returning home. In one word antiquity hath obserued it fatal to States, and a prognosticate of ruine, when they haue beene forced to call in forraigne forces for their aide and support. As that house is neere ruine whose owne timber cannot vphold it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they bring from else-where studs, and postes to vndershore it.</p>
            <p>But especially <hi>Saul</hi> will haue his souldier of the same, and not of a contrary Religion. He
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15280:8"/>
must be a friend and fauorite of Gods cause, and quarell wherein the Army standeth. And indeed nothing maketh a man so <hi>meete for the</hi> Warre as true Religion. For, 1. Onely Religion maketh a man truely valiant; it alone maketh him sell his life cheape, and be prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall of his blood for the cause of God and his Truth. A man truely religious, can (for his Religion) and will giue his body to the fire in time of peace; and to the sword in time of Warre.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Religion only maketh him truly obedient, and ordered out of conscience. That as the Centurions seruant if hee bee bidden come, or goe, or doe this or that, he doth so, yea this man will readily obey his Commander, though he die for it.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3.

Now good choyce hath onely found out such as may proue good souldiers; but it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good discipline that makes them so: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before they are meete for the warre they must be trained, and disciplined in armes, to become faithfull, expert, and exercised in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall affaires. For it is not multitudes of men, nor numbers of armes or names: nor an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannaged power, nor vnskilfull strength that carries honour and victory out of the field: but art and exercise; vse and experience: which are the best mistresse and teacher to make them prompt and actiue vnto any seruice; and a few such trained <hi>souldiers</hi> shal do much more seruice then many <hi>men.</hi> The ancient Romans deriued the issue of all their victories and triumphs (next to their gods) to this; and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that they climbed to that celebritie, height and transcendency of glory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, because they were no lesse carefull, or rather curious in disciplining their souldiers; then in trayning and instituting their children. And hence it was that the <hi>Parthians</hi> taught <note place="margin">In pace decus, in bello prasidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> euen their children the vse of the bow; as the <hi>Scythians</hi> theirs, the vse of the dart; and the <hi>Germans</hi> theirs, the vse of the speare.

            <p n="2">2. The God of heauen will not haue the faithfull seruice of men in any kind forgotten. Nay, himselfe hath recorded in his owne booke; the valour, acts, and faithfulnesse of many worthies of ancient ages; neuer to bee blotted out from the eyes and memorie of posteritie. And by the same most oculate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, the names, memorie, and vndying fame of infinite numbers more, liue in other ciuill Records and Chronicles of particular and seuerall ages, and nations; and so are likely to doe till time shall bee no more. Whereby what else can more fitly bee inferred then that inferiour and earthly gods (the Princes and Potentates of the world) should not digresse from so wise and vnerring a patterne: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther study and set themselues some way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerate and promote euery noble <hi>seruice,</hi> and <hi>seruant,</hi> according to his worth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Experience of all ages ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, witnesseth that it neuer fares so well with Church or Common wealth: as when
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15280:11"/>
true valour is aduanced by the State; and men of desert are aduanced, and graced according to their worth. Whereas all things decay; and the politicke body is in an apparant consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when honours are cheape, and places of command are carried according to fauour, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, affection; yea, or Nobility it selfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out merit or desert.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It were an vnthankefull neglect of men of worth, who vnder God are the safest guard both of King, and Kingdome: whose fortitude and faithfulnesse putteth them vpon any noble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice neuer so difficult at the becke of their Prince. Such as those three hundred Romans whom <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> shewed to a friend of his; <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> exercising their Armes, neare an high steepe Tower leaning ouer the Sea. There is neuer a one of all these three hundred (saith he) but if I bid him climbe vp that steepe Tower; and from the top of it cast himselfe downe into the Sea, but he will readily doe it.</p>
            <p>Adde hereto onely this, that no wise or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall <note place="margin">Non caret ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus civit as qua viris cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta est. Lytur.</note> Prince can neglect his walles and fortres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; he will not suffer them to moulder or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay; but will seasonably strengthen and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them for his, and his peoples safety. But men of valour and seruice are the strongest wals and rampart of the Kingdome. Of whom we may say as <hi>Abigails</hi> seruant of <hi>Dauids</hi> soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. <hi>These men are a wall vnto vs by night and by</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 16</note> 
               <hi>day.</hi> So as the neglect of a valiant man, is as the neglect of a breach in the wal of the kingdome,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15280:11"/>
or to passe carelesly a breach in the sea; either of which is an inlet to destruction.</p>
            <p>Now hauing opened the words, and shewed the iust reasons of <hi>Sauls</hi> triall and choyce of his military men; I will propound and prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <note place="margin">

Here, in that he hath deputed no other to oder it then his own chiefe vicegerent vpon earth. For it is <hi>Saul</hi> that by Gods appointment ordereth all the designes and matters of warre. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>I will send thee a man out of</hi> Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, <hi>to be the gouernour of my people, and to saue my</hi>

               <hi>people.</hi> Plainely implying that the indicting and proclayming of warre; the choyce of men; and the designing them to their seuerall places and offices, belongeth onely to the supreame Prince or Magistrate. And thus were the wars of Israel euer at the command of <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>Ioshua,</hi> or of the chiefe Iudge, or of the King for the time <note place="margin">Numb. 31. 5.</note> being. So <hi>Moses</hi> as King in Israel commanded <hi>Ioshuah</hi> his Generall to presse and chuse out of euery tribe a thousand men, to make vp an hoste of twelue thousand against <hi>Midian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And great reason. For, 1. This is the most ancient order, and most naturall. The first bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell that euer we read of was ordered by the Kings: as the phrase, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. implyeth.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The care of the Kingdome is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to the supreame Magistrate, to defend his people against the disturbers of peace: either within, by the sword of Iustice: or without, by the sword of warre. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. 11. 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It belongs not to priuate persons to <note place="margin">Non cuilibe fas aperire belli portas.</note> mooue warre: for they may prosecute their priuate right, at the publicke tribunall of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. Neither is it in their power to denounce a publicke enemy; and none is to bee reputed a publicke enemy, till hee bee publickely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by publicke authority. Neither is it in their power to gather assemblies and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes together; which must be done in warre. Much lesse to kill, and spoyle, euen an enemy without publicke warrant: for that is theft, and murder: except in sudden, and reserued cases, where the supreame Magistrate cannot be consulted; or where the law of God and nature maketh a man a Magistrate in his owne case. It is obseruable that <hi>Abishai</hi> might not by priuate reuenge defend the publicke and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Magistrate, nor the publicke weale in him.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15280:12"/>
out of his paine; <hi>Dauid</hi> slew him. And the same iustice hee executed on them that slew <hi>Ishbosheth, Sauls</hi> sonne, who raigned in Israel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">2 Sam. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Dauid:</hi> though by the fact the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was peaceably settled vpon <hi>Dauid:</hi> yet because it was by their priuate spirit: their pretence of loue, and respect to <hi>Dauid</hi> in it, <note place="margin">2 Sam. 4. 10. 11</note> secured them not, but they must die for it.

I haue heard that your worthy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der left you but two speciall rules and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the aduancing of the honour of your company. The former for the encrease, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15280:16"/>
vpholding of your Band and society, by your weekely diligent appearance, without fayling in your set exercises. The latter for the vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the band of loue, and vnity among your selues: auoyding carefully such jarres, and quarrels as might disioynt you, or make you fall off one from another. I haue heard also that both these rules haue beene forgotten amongst many of you: and especially by fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Non ut conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium faciam, sed medicinam.</hi> Lipsius.</note> in the latter; you haue almost ouer thrown the former. Yea my selfe haue beene an eye witnesse of your slender appearance, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry others to their griefe, and the dishonour, I had almost said the <hi>disbanding,</hi> of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: which made me thinke of the complaint of <hi>Vegetius,</hi> concerning the neglected military discipline of his time. But now amongst vs, <note place="margin">Disciplina ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Now therefore worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen repaire your selues, your reputation, your company, and the honour and estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: both by ioyning together, and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in mutuall and louing affections; which will tye your persons together one to another: as also by ioyning your selues in seemely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance vpon your exercise dayes. Christ hath laid a straite law vpon you for the one: and you may lay a law by your ioynt consent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15280:17"/>
vpon your selues for the other. That whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer will be of the company; hee may appeare so to be on the appointed dayes of appearance: or (without an approued reason to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) make vp his presence by his purse. It were, I confesse, more praise-worthy to bee volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in such noble actions; then necessitated by compalsion: but it were pitty that that which should be the glory of our action, (I meane the freenesse of it) should become the ouerthrow of it. Let therefore conscience to God, the seruice of your countrey, the honour of your King, the loue of Religion, and true noblenes of minde bee a stronger tye vpon you; then if you were pressed, and held by force vnto the action. Looke vpon the state of this part of Christendome; tyrannized on by Antichrists forces: behold the fury of the enemies against the Churches euery where: take to heart the inundation and floods of misery and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on let in vpon our neighbour Churches; so as the Doue of Christ can find no rest for the sole of her foote. Call to minde what hath beene, and is the lot of our neighbour countreys: what the hopes, and the aymes of the enemy against our selues: and should not now euery able man fitted with conueniency, euen out of conscience, hold himselfe called by the face, and necessity of the times; to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with skill in armes for the repulsing of such furious enemies: and for the defence of his countrey, his King; and especially of the

            <p n="2">2. The longer I haue beene in this first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, the shorter I shall bee in the rest. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond principle I would tender vnto you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the honour of your company, is: that you be carefull both to feare God your selues; and to draw in others among you that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and fearing God. The former, because all true valour and fortitude floweth from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the feare of God. By faith the <note place="margin">Hebr. 11</note> Iudges of Israel were <hi>valiant in battell, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away the forces of aliants.</hi> This alone made <hi>Eliah, the horsemen, and Chariots of Israel;</hi> all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prouision, power and policy, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is vaine. And all valour, and courage, without grace and Religion, is as a shadow without a body: or as a body without a soule. Promote therefore by all your power, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15280:18"/>
power of the Gospel first in your owne hearts, and then in your families, and then in your countreys. Get grace, and be in grace with God: and then more are they, and more powerfull that are with you; then any, or all that come against you.</p>
            <p>And next to this, get into your company men that feare God; the more of them you can draw in; the more happy and flourishing will your company be. Such as these will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the publicke, and not their priuate ends: their vertuous life will cast a lnstre vpon your meetings, their religious speeches and godly counsels will tend to edification. In a word, their holy example, course, and discourses will make your meetings fruitfull. Cast but your eyes vpon your other fraternity, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble societie of the Artillery yard; and obserue how God hath encreased their numbers, their renowne, and true honour: how they prosper in outward meanes, how louely, comely, and gracefull they are in their meetings, how dex trous and able for great seruices.
