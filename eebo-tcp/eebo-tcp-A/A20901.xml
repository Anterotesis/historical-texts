            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Chymicall Phyſicke, Halchymie, and the Spagericke
Art, as too curious, dangerous, and deſperate to bee dealt
withall. Alleaging alſo (which is too true) that many <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſts</hi>
are notable Sophyſticators and deceiuers.</p>
            <p>The meaning of ſome, by theſe and ſuch like preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
is nothing elſe, but like bad and vnskilfull <hi>Herboriſts,</hi>
to ſowe <hi>Rocket,</hi> and to weede <hi>Endiue.</hi> Yet let ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
know, that the abuſe of Art doth not abrogate the right
vſe thereof. For as if the tree be blaſted that bloſſomes, the
fault is in the winde, &amp; not in the roote: ſo the fault is not to
be aſcribed to Arte, which is not in Arte, but the Artificer
which is vnworthy the name. And in very deed, it were to be
wiſhed, for common vtillities ſake, that all ſuch cozoners and
deceiuers, might be baniſhed out of Cittie and Countrey, and
from all ſocietie of honeſt men, which without lawfull allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
take vpon them ſuch profeſsing and practiſe: or at the
leaſt, that they might be reſtrayned, that through their leaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that art be not diſgraced, which the ancients did not let to
<pb facs="tcp:10505:5"/>
call <hi>Holy.</hi> And for my part, I doubt not, but that one <hi>Aomus</hi>
or other, wil recompence me with Balme, and ſay that I am
out of my element, in that I being a profeſſed Diuine, ſhould
take vpon me to meddle with Phyſicke, &amp; to publiſh that in
the vulgar tongue, which was more fit to be in the Latine, as
I found it.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that a generalitie in humane learning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemeth
a Diuine: and of all Sciences none more ſutable to
profeſsion than Phyſick, as I could eaſily proue by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
And therfore the wiſedom of Chriſt appointed the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
wrought by himſelf &amp; his Apoſtles, to conſiſt chiefly
in healing corporal infirmities. S. <hi>Luke</hi> was both a profeſſed
Phyſitian, &amp; an Euangeliſt. It cannot be but a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

I haue theſe Inducements. Firſt, the common good of all

high reputation (as is fitting) that which before they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not, &amp; ſo wil the more readily in time of need haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the learned Phyſitian. Moreouer, if the knowledge
of holy writ be conuenient for al ſorts of men, as the Phyſick
proper for the ſoule, why ſhould not natural <hi>Phyloſophy,</hi> and
Phyſick ſpeculatiue, be common likewiſe to al for the health
of the body?<note place="margin">Num. 11. 29.</note> Therfore herein, I ſay as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid: <hi>Enuieſt thou
for me? I would al the Lords people were Prophets.</hi> So <hi>I</hi> wiſh, that
all which are capable, had the true ſpeculatiue knowledge of
Phyſick. Then ſhould <hi>Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Phyloſophy,</hi> not only haue
a more great and general eſteeme, but alſo euery meane Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarie,
the Phyſitians left hand, ſhould wel vnderſtand how
to Elixerate, which is greatly to be wiſhed.</p>
            <p>As for the time which <hi>I</hi> haue ſpent herein, it is my gaine:

a moſt ſingular knowledge of Aſtronomy
and of the celeſtial courſes, together with
the vniuerſal Science of the Mathematickes, and of ſuch like

that the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> were the firſt inuentors of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
taking their originall and infallible grounds from the
ſame <hi>Hermes,</hi> or <hi>Mercury:</hi> whoſe diuine monuments are to be
ſéene at this day.</p>
               <p>From this ancient Author <hi>Hermes,</hi> which liued in the firſt
worldes, haue ſprung vp all our Hermetical Philoſophers and
Phyſitions, whoſe traditions, haue bene receiued and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
not onely of all ſorts of learned men in all countries, but
alſo by the moſt noble and famous Princes and Kings, both
Gréekes, Arabians, and Latines.</p>
               <p>Yet it muſt be confeſſed that the moſt ancient learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
neither haue nor could deliuer ſuch a general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

               <p>

For (to vſe the words of learned <hi>Guido)</hi> we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
carried vpon the ſhoulders of thoſe great and lofty Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſe eminence we do behold, not onely thoſe things
which they ſaw, but many other miſteries alſo, which they ſaw
not. For no man is ſo ſottiſh as to imagin that thoſe firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Phyſicke had attained to the exact &amp; perfect knowledge
of Medicine, or of any other Science: which <hi>Hypocrates</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
acknowledged in his Epiſtle to <hi>Democritus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> howſoeuer otherwiſe ſingularly
learned, and of all learned men for his monuments of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
to be had in great reputation and reuerence; yet hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed
his ignorance in mineralls, and metalline miſteries: as
appeareth in his booke of <hi>Simp.</hi> where he intreating of Quick-ſiluer,
affirmeth that he neuer made tryail thereof, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
taken, nor outwardly applyed: bewraying his error in
thinking that <hi>Hydrargyre,</hi> &amp; Quick-ſiluer, were two ſeueral
things: ſuppoſing that it was a medicine of Siluer diſſolued
into water, like vnto potable golde.</p>
               <p>Hereby (I ſay) he hath bewrayed his ignorance in metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
ſubſtance, in that he knew not <hi>Hydrargyre,</hi> and Quick-ſiluer
to be all one. Whereof neuer any man doubted, except he
were ſo addicted to his teacher, that he wold ſay black is white,
becauſe his maſter ſaith ſo, which none of meane wit will do.</p>
               <p>For as we thinke them worthy of blame, which with newe
found phantaſies &amp; toyes, do go about to burne &amp; couer the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the reuerend fathers &amp; ancients, as do many Empiricks
and deceiuers, vnder the name and profeſſion of <hi>Paracelſians:</hi>
who alſo, do too ſtiffely and falſely aſcribe to <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> as to
the onely author, the knowledge of hidden things &amp; cauſes, the
finding out of myſteries, &amp; the true preparation of al remedies
and medicines: ſo in like manner they are to be reprehended
which holde it ſufficient, ſo as they talke of <hi>Galen</hi> without all
reaſon, and affirme that he was ignorant of nothing, and that
he came to the full knowledge of Medicine.</p>
               <p>It is therefore well ſaid of a learned &amp; wel experienced law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
that it is a token of great raſhnes, for wiſe men, either at
the firſt to ſubſcribe error, or to ſubuert that which might
<pb facs="tcp:10505:7"/>
pleaſe, moderated with a temperate reſolution. And yet lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men againſt all truth, do oftentimes barke againſt aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
writers, thinking it great honour and praiſe vnto them, if
they be able in any ſort to contend with their greatneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Phyloſophers which haue written of <hi>Chymiſtrie,</hi>
haue to maintaine their Science, Nature, Arte, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
by auncient practiſe deriued from the <hi>Hebrues, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deis,
Aegiptians, Perſians, Greekes, Latines,</hi> and <hi>Arabians.</hi>
This Science therefore is not grounded (as ſome ſuppoſe) vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a vaine an imaginarie ſpeculation, but is found moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and infallible to the procuring of health, and length of
dayes to many, by the goodneſſe of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>Neither doth this Science onely affoord, common extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of oyles and waters, by ordinary Diſtillations, (as many
Emperis doe imagine) but alſo moſt precious <hi>Elipirs</hi> &amp; Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſences,
much laboured, circulated, and wrought, by digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
concoctions, and fermentations, by the meanes whereof
all impure and corrupt matter is defeked and ſeparated, the
euil quality corrected &amp; amended, &amp; that which is bitter, is made
ſwéet. Without the which operations, our bread, béere, &amp; wine,
the ordinary and moſt principal meanes of our nouriſhment,
become hurtful &amp; pernicious vnto vs. For if we ſhould eat raw
wheate, or hoyled onely in water: what &amp; how many diſeaſes
would grow in vs? For this cauſe we ſeparate the pure from
the impure, that they may be profitable for vs, as the meale
from the bran, the which meale or flower, we mixe with water,
we leauen and bake, whereof ariſeth a great magiſtery, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bread fit for nouriſhment: and by his artifice, apt to paſſe and
turne into our fleſh: in the working whereof, if there be but a
little error, it wil not be ſo pleaſing to the taſt, nor ſo fitting to
nouriſhment, as is to be ſéene in bread, either ill ſeaſoned, or
not wel baked: the which we reiect through theſe defaults.</p>
               <p>The like practiſe &amp; worke is to be vſed in wines, if we deſire
to haue them fitte for our vſe. For the pure muſt be ſeparated
from the impure, by boylings, digeſtions, and firmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſeparating from the kernells and ſkinnes, the liquor of the
grapes, that it may be brought into pure wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:8"/>
This done, and being put into veſſels, it worketh newe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
fermentations, diſgeſtions, and purgations, ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the dregges and lées, from the pure ſubſtance of the wine;
the which ſo ſeperated, it becommeth fine and cleare, and is fit
to be dranke for nouriſhment: Whereas otherwiſe taken
with the lees &amp; not fined, it bréedeth diſſenterie, fluxes, the ſtone,
paine in the head, and procureth ſuch like diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chymiſts</hi> therfore immitating nature in theſe kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
and haue learned them in her ſchoole: finding by effect in
natures worke, that if common &amp; ordinary meates &amp; drinkes
vnprepared, vnſeaſoned, &amp; rude, cannot be taken into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
without perill, then Phyſitians, and Apothecaries, ought
to prepare, ſeperate &amp; purge thoſe ſimples which they ſhal vſe
for medicine, by arte ſeperating the croſſe impurity, that they
may not be more hurtful to the weake and ſick, then profitable.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Hypocrates</hi> or <hi>Galen</hi> himſelfe, were now againe aliue,
they would excéedingly reioyce to ſée art ſo inlarged &amp; augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by ſo great and noble addition, and would patronize and
vpholde with their owne hands, that which was hidden from
the old fathers in former ages: and reiecting many of theſe
things, which before pleaſed them, yéelding to reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
would gladly imbrace the new. For it is euident by
their writings, how vncertaine and doubtful they be in many
things, by reaſon of the weakeneſſe of the foundation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they haue builded. Whoſe buldings notwithſtanding, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to ouerthrow, no wiſe and modeſt Phhloſopher wil goe
about, but will rather endeuour to vphold them, that poſterity
may well and aſſuredly knowe that we were not barren, but
endued with the ſame wit that they had, and that our mindes
were ſeaſoned with that more noble ſalt. The which ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
it not reiecting the writings of our elders, we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
and adorne them with newe inuentions.</p>
               <p>For artes come by tradition, and are deliuered as it were
from hand to hand, and euery one adorneth his arte with new
inuentions, according as he excelleth others in dexteritie of
wit. And albeit, it may be ſaid, that it is an eaſie matter to adde
<pb facs="tcp:10505:8"/>
to that which is inuented, yet both the Inuentors, and alſo the
augmentors, are to be thankfully imbraced.</p>

of a liuing Creature, all the members doe agrée) that there
<pb facs="tcp:10505:9"/>
is no one part of the parties, of that great body, which is not
inlyned, quickened, and ſuſteined, by the benefite of that vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
ſoule, which they haue called the ſoule of the worlde:
affirming alſo, that if the bodyes of liuing creatures doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue
life and beeing from the ſoule which is in them; the
ſame is much more done and effected in the farre more noble
and more excellent body of the whole world, by the meanes
of the more potent and farre more excellent ſoule, with the
which this body of the vniuerſall world is indued, and by
which it ſubſiſteth. For it all the parts of the world haue life,
(as manifeſtly appearing it hath) then muſt it needes follow,
that wholely it liueth, for that the parts drawe and deriue
their life from the whole, from the which they being ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
cannot but periſh and die. And héereupon they inferre,
that the <hi>Heauen</hi> compaſſing all things, is that <hi>Soule,</hi>
which nouriſheth and ſuſteineth all things. Alſo, further they
affirme, that all the formes, virtues, and faculties of things,
by which all things are neuriſhed, ſuſteined, and haue their
being doe come from the worlds <hi>Soule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the body and ſoule are gathered and ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one, through the benefite of the Spirits bond, for that
it is partaker of both Natures: ſo the ſoule and body of the
world are knit together by the meanes of the <hi>Aethereall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
going betwéene, ioyning each part of the whole into one
ſubſiſtence. And yet hereof we muſt not conclude as did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodiſaeus</hi>
and <hi>Philoponas,</hi> which were <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> that
the worlde is a moſt huge liuing creature, indued with ſenſe
and vnderſtanding, wiſe and happie: the which is a moſt
abſurde and falſe opinion. But the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> by the ſoule of
the world, gaue vs rather to vnderſtand a certaine ſpirit,
which cheriſheth, quickeneth, conſerueth, and ſuſteineth all
things,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> as it were a certaine ſpirit of that <hi>Elohym,</hi> or great
God, which mooued vpon the waters: which <hi>Plato</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
as one not ignorant of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thereupon frame
his ſoule of the worlde. Whereupon alſo it muſt needes come
to paſſe, that all theſe inferior things, otherwiſe tranſitorie and
infirme, ſhould ſoone come to deſtruction, without they were
<pb facs="tcp:10505:10"/>
conſerued and continued in theyr being by that diuine power,
perpetually maintaining and ſuſpecting them: the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſſeuered, a great confuſion &amp; perturbation of the whole
worlde ariſe therof. Which ruine and deſtruction, God of his
great goodnes would preuent, creating that vniuerſall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which ſhould defende all this great worke, and kéepe it
ſafe and ſounde, by his vertue and moderation: and that by
the yearely and continual rotation and reuolution of the right
Heauen, and by the Influences and vertues of the Starres,
Planets, and Celeſtiall powers, all things might be well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned,
and might conſtantly remaine and abide in full faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

               <p>To this <hi>Aethereall</hi> ſpirit, or rather Diuine power, euery
effectuall and Omnipotent, <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeo</hi> giueth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie,
when hée ſpeaketh thus: <hi>When the ſempiternall
GOD had created this Vniuerſal, hee put into it certaine
ſeedes of reaſon, &amp; brought in the beginning Life, that he
might beget with the world the procreating force.</hi> Wherein
our explication which I brought before concerning the <hi>Soule</hi>
of the worlde is confirmed. Which alſo agreeth with that
which the Prophet <hi>Moſes</hi> hath written, and which King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
hath in his Pſalme, in theſe wordes: <hi>By the worde of
the Lorde were the Heauens made, and all the vertue of
them by the ſpirit of his mouth.</hi> By which vertue of the
quickning ſpirit, that great <hi>Trimegiſtus</hi> more conuerſant
and exerciſed in <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, then all other Philoſophers,
vttered theſe diuine wordes in his ſecond booke, which is called
<hi>Aſclepias: All ſpirit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the world, is acted and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
by the ſpirit. The ſpirit telleth all things: the
worlde nouriſheth bodies, the ſpirit giueth them ſoule. By
the ſpirit all things in the world are miniſtred, &amp; are made
to growe and increaſe.</hi> And after that he ſaith againe: <hi>All
things haue neede of this ſpirit. For it carryeth all things,
and it quickneth &amp; nouriſheth all things, according to the
dignitie of eache thing in it ſelfe. Life and the ſpirit is</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:10"/>
brought forth out of the holy fountaine. By which diuine
words it appeareth plainely, that this eternal and quickening
ſpirit is infuſed and put into all things: ſo that it is not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to deduce and deriue the actions, forces, and powers: alſo
all naturall things, from the ſpirits, as from the cauſes.</p>

it reſteth that ſomewhat be ſpoken
of nature natured, that is to ſay, of that

do thinke, that whatſoeuer is the beginning of generation,
ought to be called nature by a certaine peculiar right. And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
ſaith, that the ſame, from whence any thing is made
at the firſt, and whereof it hath the firſt motion, mutation is
the very beginning.<note place="margin">Metaph. 5.</note> I ſay the beginning, from whence the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of all natural things ariſeth. The which nature <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
in another place defineth to be the beginning ſubſtantiall
and the cauſe of motion, and of the reſt thereof,<note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> in the which
it is at the firſt, and not by <hi>Accidents:</hi> the explication of which
definition he hath comprehended in eight bookes. And <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
doth rightly call Nature, the cauſe and the beginning
of internall motion. For thoſe things which are made by
Nature, and are therefore called naturall, haue a certaine
beginning of motion, whereby they are moued of their owne
accord, not by force. Whereby plainly appeareth the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene thoſe things which are naturall, and which
<pb facs="tcp:10505:11"/>
are endued with an effectuall ſpirit; and with power to worke
by it ſelfe: and thoſe things which are made by Arte, which
haue no force nor power of doing, but are dead, and deuoided
of all ſenſe and motion.</p>
               <p>By theſe things it appeareth, that things natural are called
properly naturall exiſtences or beings, and ſuch as haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And they are ſaide to haue nature, which poſſeſſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
the beginning of their motion, and of their reſt: the
which beginning of motion of euery thing, is either the forme
or the matter, wherof we haue ſpoken. <hi>Forme,</hi> which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpiritual, hath all her motion likewiſe ſpiritual. So the ſoule
is of this ſame nature in a liuing creature, the motions and
ſences plainely celeſtiall, ſpirituall, and a light beginning.
Whereas the <hi>Matter</hi> is terreſtriall, ponderous, and corporal,
the other beginning of naturall motion. By whoſe waight
and groſſeneſſe, the body tendeth downeward, ſo as this kind
of motion procéedeth not from the ſoule, or ſpirituall forme, but
from the corporall matter, which is terreſtriall and heauy by
his owne nature. Hereof it commeth, that the name of nature,
is giuen as well to <hi>Matter</hi> as to <hi>Forme:</hi> but more aptly and
conueniently to <hi>Forme:</hi> becauſe <hi>Forme</hi> doth manifeſtly
giue to a thing his being, actually: whereas <hi>Matter</hi> alone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
performe that.</p>
               <p>For not euery liuing creature, hath ſenſe and motion
from that body which is ſolid, terreſtriall and ponderous: but
onely from the ſpiritual forme: that is to ſay, the ſoule mouing
the body, and informing it with the vitall vertues. As for
example.</p>
               <p>A horſe is in act, and in truth a horſe, when he neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
leapeth, nor runneth: but theſe motions which are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
are the effects &amp; operations of the ſoule or forme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
otherwiſe the body hauing nothing but the lineaments,
and viſible forme, whereby it ſéemeth a horſe is meere
terreſtriall, heauie and deade. Howbeit, neither the ſoule
alone of the horſe, can bée ſaide to bée a horſe, except it be
coupled with the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:11"/>
For both being ioyned and coupled together make a horſe.</p>
               <p>Knowe therefore that the <hi>Forme</hi> is far more noble and

and perfiteth all things. Therefore the ſecond cauſe, is
called <hi>Nature,</hi> becauſe by the ſame, as by a vital inſtrument,
God, who is the firſt cauſe worketh all things. For thus God
féedeth men with bread, the which he hath indued with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

are the Milt, the bladder of the Gaule, and the Reines. So
there are thrée principall veſſels which doe ſerue the whole
body, namely, the Arteries, the Sinewes, and the Veines.
Further if we conſider the head againe, it hath thrée ſkinnes.
The braine hath thrée bellyes, two ſoft before, and one hard

               <p>Therefore theſe thrée formall beginnings, which we haue
deſcribed by their offices and propertions, albeit they are more
ſpirituall than corporall, yet being ioyned with ſimple Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they make a materiall body mixt and compound, they

And ſéeing the properties, Impreſſions, and faculties are

materiall ſoeuer thoſe ſéedes be: yet notwithſtanding they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the Elements doe more cleaue and inclyne to <hi>Matter</hi> than to

ſimple beginnings formall, becauſe they are more principall,
adorned and inriched with the firſt and chiefe faculties of
aſtral ſéedes. But the Elements, they call beginnings, mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall

we ſhall finde that which is ſaid to be true: namely, that
ſome ſimple beginnings are formall and ſpirituall: others
materiall, corporall, and viſible. And that the Inuiſibles are
the Elements ſimple, formall, the aſtral ſéedes, and ſpirituall
beginnings. Alſo that the viſibles are all one and the ſame,
but yet couered with a materiall body. The which two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,

and yet is within it.</p>

               <p>Among Salts, ſome are earthie, ſome watery, and ſome

               <p>And al <hi>Salt,</hi> whether it be flying, or fixed, is no otherwiſe
diſſolued and commixed in waters, than with the water of
<hi>Water,</hi> and if one be a dry water, the other is moyſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe thrée kindes of <hi>Saltes,</hi> which lye hydden in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
parts of things, whether they be metalline, vegitable, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal,
and which are principally ſeated in that element, which
produceth his generations out of the earth, they do participat
of the nature of the thrée beginnings. For the common ſalte,
and that which is of the ſea, paſſing through the philter of the
earth, and boyled and digeſted with the heates of the bowels
of the ſame earth, doth participate of the nature of fixed and
firme ſalt, the father and original of all others. But <hi>Niter,</hi>
being partly fixed, and in part volatile, doth participate of the
ſulphurus beginning of things: euen as <hi>Sal Amoniac</hi> doth
participate of the <hi>Mercuriall</hi> beginning ſpirituall and ayrie:
whoſe extreames, to wit, fixed and volatile, of the ſulphurus

coagulated or congealed: and the <hi>Armoniac</hi> volatile &amp; ayrie,
flying in part out of the Lye, and partly contained in both the
<hi>Saltes</hi> and therefore hydden from the ſences. This may bée

Which thrée diſtinct differences of <hi>Saltes,</hi> as they are to be

the marine and fixed, and the <hi>Niterus</hi> volatile, they may be

together, or apart by themſelues, with a receiuer, firſt by the
force of fire ſtilleth forth a Volatile <hi>Salt,</hi> ſower, ſharpe and
Mercurial: then, with a greater heate, commeth forth a <hi>Salt
Sulphurus</hi> and <hi>Niterus,</hi> and ſwéete: the third <hi>Salt,</hi> which is
<hi>Salt</hi> vpon <hi>Salt</hi> fixed, will not moue with any force of fier, but
remaineth conſtantly in the bottome of the glaſſe.</p>
               <p>All taſtes are brought forth out of theſe thrée ſundry <hi>Saltes,</hi>
common to that triple beginning of things, ſo as we ſhall not
néede to haue recourſe to hot and cold, moiſt and dry. For they
are procreated out of thoſe beginnings alone. Fixed <hi>Salt,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as it is ſimple, and without commixtion, maketh ſimply a
ſalt taſt. A <hi>Sulphurus Salt</hi> alſo ſimply vnderſtoode, yéeldeth
out of it a ſwéete oylely taſte. But <hi>Mercurial Salt,</hi> in like ſort
conceiued by it ſelfe and apart, repreſenteth a ſower taſte. All
which taſtes mixed together in equall proportions, yéelde a
pleaſant and delightful taſte, without any ſenſe or taſte of any
of the particulars.</p>
               <p>Theſe thrée beginnings cannot be found ſimple in a mixt
body, in ſuch wiſe, but that they haue ſome compoſition, and do
in mixture communicate their qualities together: as may bée
ſéene in ſea-ſalt, and ſalt-péeter, out of the which may be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
not onely a ſalt and ſharpe taſte, but alſo a ſwéete taſte.
And it is certaine, that in things ſulphurus and oylely, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in Mercurial liquors, there is to be found a coniunction of
ſuch taſtes.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe we affirme, that all fixed <hi>Salt</hi> of a mixt body,
is very briniſh and excéeding bitter: the ſulphurus, of a fat and
ſweete taſte: and the <hi>Mercurial,</hi> ſower, ſharpe and fiery. So
that vpon theſe ſimple qualities, ſalt, ſwéete, and ſower, (which
are to be found in all bodies minerall, vegitable and animal) all
others taſtes do depend.</p>
               <p>And as touching the elementary qualities paſſiue, which
<pb facs="tcp:10505:17"/>
are as organical and inſtrumentall cauſes, they little apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to this matter: whether it be the terreſtrial and drie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue
quality, &amp; paſſiue coldneſſe, or whether it be the aiery moiſt
vapor, the which taſtes of this ſort, or potent qualities, procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from theſe thrée beginnings, do either further to this or
that nature, or elſe doe impaire and weaken them. To make
this plaine by manifeſt reaſons, and to lay it open before our
eyes, we will begin to intreat of mixed bodies, the which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
according to the Elements, are moſt ſimple.</p>

of taſtes.</p>
               <p>In the boſome of nature, there are found almoſt ſo many
kinde of <hi>Saltes,</hi> as there are variety of taſtes. Digged or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and marine Salt, is endued with a ſalt qualitie. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
with a bitter quality: <hi>Allum,</hi> with a ſharpe: <hi>Vitriol,</hi> with
a ſower: <hi>Armoniac,</hi> with a ſharpe and ſower quality. But
ſwéete Saltes do manifeſtly appeare, not onely in <hi>Manna,</hi>
and in <hi>Sugar,</hi> but alſo in marine ſalt, and in ſalt of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> out
of which they are to be ſeperated. And (as we haue ſaid) in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
of theſe ſalts, theſe thrée firſt beginnings, <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi>
and <hi>Merucry,</hi> are contained ioyntly together: one aiery, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial,
or ſpiritual, the which is ſharpe and ſower; the other
earthly, which is ſower, and bitter: and the third oylely &amp; ſweet,
which is a meane betwéene them both. In <hi>Vitriol</hi> alone, is
manifeſtly to be ſéene, egar, ſharpe, ſower, and aſtringent, for
that of all other Salts, it is moſt corporal.</p>
               <p>But thoſe taſtes or qualities, which are mixed with paſſiue
<pb facs="tcp:10505:17"/>
and Elementarie qualities, haue not the full force of euery
of theſe, but are made more weake by mixtion: for the ſharpe
(which is not extracted and ſeperated but by the force of the
fier with the aiery part) is mixed with a mercurial liquor:
the ſower is mixed with a flegmetique, or watery humour:
and the eger, with a terreſtrial drineſſe: the which, the more
they haue of the Elementary qualities, and the ſame paſſiue,
ſo much the more weake they are and impaired. But if the
actiue qualities be ſeparated from the paſſiue, as by arte it is to
be done, then the tarte and ſower do obtaine their full force,
and doe manifeſtly and fully burne the tongue with their fiers:
for the ſharpe hath a more fiery and burning qualitie: and the
ſower, a more watery propertie. For the ſharpe partaking of
the nature of fire, hath ouermuch vertue to attenuate, diſſipate,
and to fret: the ſower, as, aiery, watery, &amp; of thinne parts, hath
vertue to cutte, to open, to refrigerate, and alſo to put away
putrifactions. The eger and more tarte, which remaineth in
the <hi>Colchotar</hi> (after the extraction of the ſharpe oylely, and
ſower water, with the aiery parts of the elemental qualities)
do poſſeſſe a nature and force to thicken and binde, by reaſon
of the earthy and groſſe propertie.</p>
               <p>But if from that terreſtrial parte, the pure (which is Salt)
be extracted, it wil haue a ſalt taſte, by the vertue whereof it
wil bée made, both deiectiue, and vomitiue. And in the ſwéete
<hi>Sulphur</hi> of Vitriol, there is a manifeſt ſwéetneſſe, which is
plainely ſtupefactiue.</p>
               <p>Finally, in all Salts, almoſt, (diſſeuered by <hi>Chymicall</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration)
theſe thrée are to be diſcerned, Sower, Swéete, and
Bitter, which haue force of actiue qualities, and yet not deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the moiſt paſſiue, terreſtrial and groſſe, but with them,
in ſundry wiſe ſo ſeaſoned and tempered, that they bring to the
Salts, varety of taſtes.</p>
               <p>And let this ſerue for demonſtration, by which it may
plainely appeare, that thoſe ſundry differences of taſtes, are
manifeſtly contained in Salts, both ioyntly and ſeuerally,
<pb facs="tcp:10505:18"/>
eſpecially in their ſpirits: And according to the opinion of
<hi>Hermes</hi> ſchollers, we deny that thoſe inſet and naturall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
vertues, and properties, are to be arrogated to hotte,
moiſt, and drie, but rather to the eſſences of a nature which is
ſalt, bitter, eger, ſharpe, ſower, tarte, ſwéete, and oylely.</p>
               <p>For there are ſixe hundred frigidities or coldes, ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
heates, humidities, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>gities or drineſſes, then the which
nothing doth more heate, coole, moyſten, and dry. But they
haue neuer brought any ſauour or taſte to pure or ſimple wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or to other Iuices or liquors, which haue béene deſtitute
of <hi>Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer is without <hi>Salt,</hi> or deſtitute of a briniſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
can neuer be diſcerned by taſte, but is vtterly vnſauory.
Yet notwithſtanding, it ſimple water be powred vpon aſhes,
with a little heate, that water wil drawe vnto it ſaltneſſe, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe,
or ſharpneſſe, more or leſſe, according to the nature of
the ſalt, more or leſſe ſalt, or bitter, which is contained in the
aſhes.</p>
               <p>And if any man obiect, that Hony and Sugar by boyling,
or by the force of fier, may be made ſharpe or bitter: we anſwer
that it commeth ſo to paſſe, when the aiery ſulphurus, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
partes, which bring and preſerue the ſwéetneſſe do periſh
and are ſeparated by decoction. But terreſtrial <hi>Salt,</hi> whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
are inward, haue this property, that of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
they poſſeſſe, this or that ſharpe or bitter taſte, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
ſoeuer it be. So if thou ſhalt drawe out of onions and
garlicke a Volatile and aiery ſharpe Mercurial <hi>Salt,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
in the ſuperficies &amp; vppermoſt of their bodies: thou ſhalt
make them more ſwéet and pleaſing, and to put off their ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
by which they bite the tongue: but yet they will retaine
and repreſent their hot qualitie, with the which they abound,
by reaſon of their fixed <hi>Saltes.</hi> As out of <hi>Saltes,</hi> ſo out of odours
alſo, we may drawe certaine faculties, without the helpe of
hotte qualities. For ſéeing they are referred to the diuers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> ſundry odours doe ariſe therfrom, and not
from the qualities. Which if they be ſwéete and pleaſing, the
<pb facs="tcp:10505:18"/>
braine receiueth them with pleaſure and delight, whereas
vnpleaſant ſauours or odours, are offenſiue both to the noſe
and to the braine, and are reiected. Such is the marcotical
and ſtefactiue odour of <hi>Poppie,</hi> and <hi>Hemlock,</hi> and ſuch like
which do ſtinke, and aſtoniſh the braine, by reaſon (as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
affirme) of their colde qualitie: Wherein they breake
the Lawe of their axiomes, for that they holde that their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
are of a hotte qualitie, as moſt true it is. For that
which is ſtupefactiue in the Poppeis, and in Opium, is
no other thing, but a certaine oylely and ſulphurus parte
conceiuing flame, (much like to that kinde of oyle, which
is extracted out of the ſéedes of Poppey) the which albeit it
do readily burne, yet as it is commonly thought, it ſheweth
moſt colde effects. The common Phyſitians, to correct
ſuch coldneſſe attributed to <hi>Opium,</hi> vſe helpes, as is to bee
ſéene in their opiat and antidotarie medicines, wherein Opium
is an Ingredient. Of theſe kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſitions <hi>Myrepſus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth
aboue foure ſcore: where <hi>Euphorbium</hi> (which is of a
fiery and burning facultie) is no more forborne then either of
the Peppers, or ſuch other like cauſticke and burning ſimples,
of extreame hotte qualitie: when as the true and proper
corrector of Opium (that I may ſo ſpeake) wel knowne to
<hi>Hermeticall</hi> Phyſitians, is Vineger; which putteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
ſtupefactiue vapours and fumes, that they aſcende not
to the braine, ſo ſuppreſſing them by the ſharpneſſe thereof, that
it retaineth them: whereas their hot correctors do more ſtirre
them vp and multiple them. Hereof come ſiniſter and deadly
paſſions and paines, by reaſon whereof men are conſtrained
to vſe the imperfect <hi>Laudanum</hi> of Empiricks, againſt the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow ſomewhat ſhall be ſaide concerning
colours. The dogmatical Phyſitians,
that they might not diminiſh any whit
of the qualities of colours, are woont to
referre to thoſe qualities a certaine varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of colours: and haue obſerued and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
certaine friuolous and light obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
as when they ſay, that in a white onion, or in white
wine, a man may iudge by the colour a great coldneſſe, than
in a read onion, or in red wine. Whereas white ſublimate,
and <hi>Arſnic,</hi> albeit they are moſt white like vnto Chriſtall: yet
neuertheleſſe vnder this whiteneſſe, they foſter and hide a moſt
burning and deadly fire. Yea Sugar it ſelfe, which is ſo ſwéet,
white, and pleaſant, doth hide in the innermoſt parts thereof, a
wonderfull blackneſſe and ſharpneſſe, from whence may bée
extracted moſt ſharpe liquors and waters, which will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
and breake the moſt hard metalls. Therefore it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
to ſharpe and forme colours from hotte and colde, which
do procéede from the ſpirits only, or elſe from the moſt thinne
and aiery vapours, which lye hid in the Salt: eſpecially in that
Salt which by nature is ſulphurus, ſuch as is <hi>Niter,</hi> or Salt-Peter,
as men call it. <hi>Niter</hi> throughly depured and clenſed,
will be as white as ſnow; from which whiteneſſe, may be
drawen infinite ſorts of colours, moſt excellent to beholde.
Which colours come from the onely ſpirits of Salt-peter,
which are able to pearce the moſt hard kind of glaſſe, by the
force of fire thruſt forth in the likeneſſe of volatile meale, and
cleaning in the ouerture of the glaſſe Alembic. By which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may behold the body of the Alembic to be tained &amp;
dyed, as well within as without in the ſuperficial part: Which
colours are of no leſſe varietie, then are the flowers of the
earth in the time of the Spring. Hereby it appeareth plainely,
that this diuerſitie of all colours is to be taken from the ſpirits,
<pb facs="tcp:10505:19"/>
no leſſe nor otherwiſe, then are all other properties and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of all other things to be referred vnto them.</p>
               <p>If therefore the foundation of theſe thrée things be laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thrée beginnings, &amp; vpon their ſpirits, it will be very firme
and ſtable, in ſuch wiſe, that in the ignorance of any cauſe, it
ſhal not be néedful to fly to hidden properties.</p>
               <p>If this doctrine, according to the truth thereof, be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
learned, and ſtudied, being vpholden alſo with the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of that great <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> it ſhal eaſily driue from vs
the darkeneſſe of ignorance, and ſhal bring with it the light of
knowledge, which will remoue all difficulties: For out of
this ſchoole are learned moſt certain and infallible Thearemes
and Axiomes, againſt which, as againſt moſt aſſured grounds,
there can be no oppoſition or reſiſtance: but wil be allowed by
the general conſent of indifferent Iudges.</p>
               <p>Let vs take an example from Vineger: whereof many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Phyſitians, cannot tell what certainely to affirme. For,
becauſe it is ſharpe, and therefore cooleth, they wil haue it to
be colde. But contrariwiſe, when they behold the facultie
thereof, to be attenuating, cutting, and diſſoluing, alſo their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ernor and boyling thereof, when it is put vpon earth or claie,
they are conſtrained to forſake their opinion, vncertaine what
to iudge thereof. Who, if they had bene acquainted with
the <hi>Hermeticall</hi> doctrine, they ſhould haue knowne, that the
cauſe of ſuch tartneſſe or ſowerneſſe in vineger, commeth by
the ſeperation of the ſpirit, from the wine: as is plainly ſéene by
experience. For the longer that wine ſtandeth in the Sun, or
in a hotte place, the more by little and little it waxeth ſharpe;
and whatſoeuer is aiery therein, and of the quinteſſence of the
wine, by the force of the heat vaporeth away. This eternal and
celeſtial eſſence being gone, which was the cauſe of the wines
ſwéetnes (which ſwéetnes hath alwaies ioyned with it neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
a certaine pricking very acceptable to the pallate, by
reaſon of a ſingular temper of ſharpneſſe Vitriolated by
ſwéete and Sulphurus ſpirits, put by the inſtinct of nature
into wine) at the length it waxeth ſower: the cauſe of
whoſe ſharpneſſe, is not to be referred to the colde qualities,
<pb facs="tcp:10505:20"/>
but to thoſe hidden and ſower ſpirits of <hi>Salt,</hi> which by the
bonde of the ſulphurus ſubſtance, were contained and kept in
their office and working in the wine: the which bond being
diſſolued, the ſpirits range at will, and doe make manifeſt
their nature, which was afore hidden. Hereupon it commeth,
that vnegers are ſharper in one ſort, then in another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they haue in them more or leſſe of the nature of <hi>Salt</hi>
Armoniac, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o whit of the ſulphurus ſubſtance. For ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
water deuoide of all <hi>Salt,</hi> can neuer by reaſon of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
therein waxe ſower. But as from wine, ſo from meat,
and from ale or béere, and from boyling new wine, may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
the proper water of life, and ethereal ſubſtance, the
which being ſo ſeparated, they become eager, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
in themſelues a ſharpe ſalt of nature.</p>
               <p>Such is that ſharpe ſalt, which <hi>Phyloſophers</hi> call their
<hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Salt Armoniac,</hi> Volatile and ſpiritual (becauſe
of al metalline ſalts, the common <hi>Armoniac</hi> is moſt Volatile,
ſuch as in the forme of moſt white and ſalt meale, may be
carried vp vnto the cloudes by ſublimation, and yet hath a dry
and ſpiritual nature, which the <hi>Phyloſophers</hi> call their dry
water: becauſe this <hi>Salt</hi> is ſo farre forth Volatile and flying,
that it is lifted vp together with the aiery or watery vapour,
of the which is made the mixture of the compound: and ſo
great is the ſharpneſſe of this ſalt, that one ſcruple or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene
or twenty graines of this ſalt perfitly refined and made
moſt ſimple, diſſolued in a pot of commom water, doth make
all the ſame wonderfully ſower.</p>
               <p>And this is the <hi>Salt,</hi> (the ſulphurus eſſence taken away)
which ſheweth it ſelfe euidently to be ſéene by his ſharpneſſe
in vineger, with watery ſubſtance. But the more ſtrong the
wine ſhal be, the more ſharpe the ferment of the vineger, and
the more vehement the tartneſſe thereof will ſhewe it ſelfe: out
of the which the pearcing, attenuating, &amp; diſſoluing ſpirits, are
extracted by a ſkilful workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the which forces &amp; faculties can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
procéed from any other thing, then from that ſpiritual and
Volatile ſalt Armoniac, mixed with a watery humour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:20"/>
And to make this more plaine, and to proue it by effect,
take the moſt ſtrong <hi>Vinegar,</hi> white or red: diſtil the ſame in
<hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> till it be drie, with a gentle fire, out of a pinte
and a halfe, you ſhall extract thrée partes or more, like moſt
cleare water, but moſt ſharpe and ſower, the bottome of the
matter as the léeſe and pheſes remaining in the bottome of the
glaſſe with the moſt ſharpe and byting Salt, the which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is fixed, and cleauing to the terreſtrial part of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar,
cannot be extracted but by the great violence of the fire.
By which meane a moſt ſharpe oyle, like in nature to <hi>Aqua
Regia,</hi> moſt corroding and fretting, is extracted, not by reaſon
of the heate of fire, but by the force and power of a briniſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which is expelled in forme of an oyle with the Salt
from the reſt of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eces, by fire.</p>
               <p>But leauing that ſharpe fire of the Léeſe, let vs take in
hand to explicate the ſowernes of the Vineagar diſtilled. By
a ſoft and gentle diſtillation, is firſt of all extracted, a certaine
watry elementary phleme, which is drawne out of the whole
body almoſt without taſte, leauing in the bottome of the glaſſe,
another liquour, farre more ſower and ſharpe, and therefore
more ſtrong to diſſolue, which otherwiſe before was nothing
ſo ſharp, becauſe the Salt Armoniac was tempered and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a watery Phleame. Whereof if thou deſire to know
the quantitie, take ſo much of the beſt <hi>Salt Tartar,</hi> which is
of the ſame nature, but fixed, by which if thou drawe by little
and little thrée pintes of this Vinegar diſtilled, and diſph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
to the waight of one ounce, thou ſhalt finde the volatile
Salt Armoniac to be conioyned with the ſharpe fixed Salt:
and that which ſhall be diſtilled from the ſame, will become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
without taſte, or a little ſwéetiſh, the volatile Salt
Armoniac being gone, through the paſſage in the fixed Salt.
So that the ſaid ounce of <hi>Salt Tartar,</hi> is increaſed by one
ſcruple or more of volatile Salt, increaſing the quantitie of
the other fixed. Thus that volatil Salt Armoniac which vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
out of the Vinegar with the watry and aierie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is retained by paſſage, in the proper fixed Salt, and
there abioeth, and by his abſence, diſpoyling the diſtilled li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
<pb facs="tcp:10505:21"/>
of all ſowerneſſe: the which is therefore of no vertue, or
of leſſe efficacie, then pure and ſimple water. Hereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
how litle ferment is néedful to a great quantitie of paſte,
to acuate and augment the ſame, as Phyloſophers ſpeak: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which, the elementary water wil haue no ſharpeneſſe.
For if that Salt Armoniac be wanting, as touching the force
and vertue thereof, water hath neither tartneſſe, nor taſte at
all.</p>
               <p>Therefore a <hi>Hermetical</hi> Phyloſopher &amp; Phiſitian, which
is wel acquainted with the liuely anatonie of things, wil teach,
that the ſharpe, ſower, and attenuating taſte of vineger, and
the diſſoluing facultie thereof, ariſeth herehence, becauſe tart
things, whether they be waters, or iuices, are mixed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
with ſalt Armoniac: and that therefore Vineger, not
onely in regard of the tarneſſe thereof, but alſo that moſt thin
ſpirituous ſower eſſence of Salt, doe pierce into the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts euen of the hard bodyes. And if it ſhewe foorth
any cooling effects, it commeth thereof, becauſe the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
and fierie qualitie of the wine, that is to ſay, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua
Vitae,</hi> is ſeperated: without the ſeperation whereof it
can neuer bée made vineger, and can at no time yéelde any
taſte of <hi>Aqua Vitae.</hi> And that ſharpeneſſe by which it burneth,
is the chariot or carrier away, of the elementarie and colde
water, by the which it is carryed and pierceth into the
moſt inward and ſecret partes, as wée haue learned by
often experience, that in that water, the ſame ſharpneſſe
is contained, and moſt néerely conioyned therewith.</p>
               <p>Nowe, as we haue ſhewed that the ſower and mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
liquor of things, doth borrow that tartneſſe, from a certaine
Armoniac ſalt, and volatile, which ariſeth from the fixed:
euen ſo the ſulphurus and oylie liquor, doth receiue and
taketh his vertue from no other thing, than from that
ſwéete Niterous ſulphurus ſalt, which borroweth the ſame
from fixed ſalt: ſo that, in the fixed ſalt, and out of that ſalt,
that mercuriall ſowerneſſe, and ſulphurus vertue doe ſpring,
<pb facs="tcp:10505:21"/>
and doe receiue their fruits therefro, as from the roote and
firſt originall.</p>
               <p>As alſo héere it is to be noted, and to be wondred at, that
a tryple ſubſtance is ſeuerally to be extracted, out of one and
the ſame Eſſence: from whence all things created, do ſucke
and drawe their faculties, vertues and properties: and that
the ſame doe ſo ſubſiſt in one and the ſame ſubiect, that two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are to be produced from one other. And the ſame thrée
eſſences, when they are ſeparated, and coupled together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and vnited, are then inriched and increaſed with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
vertues and faculties, and haue gotten excéeding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
The which, the more often that they be ſeparated
and vnited, the more perfect and high degrees of power and

               <p>
                  <hi>Plinius Secundus,</hi> vſed the aſhes of beaſtes and foules, as moſt
ſingular and familar remedies.</p>
               <p>All the auncient writers, ſpeake of a little bird like a Wrenne,
which is called <hi>Regulus Troglodites,</hi> and haue taught that the
ſame being brought into aſhes, is ſingular remedie for the Stone.
Alſo they ſay, that glaſſe calcined and burnt into aſhes, hath the
ſame effect. And many of our later Phyſitians, doe vſe the aſhes of a
ſpoonge, drunke in white wine, for the cure of the <hi>Broncoceles,</hi>
which is a diſeaſe aryſing from the throates kernells, of ſome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

               <p>
                  <hi>Aelius</hi> propoundeth many and ſundry remedies,<note place="margin">Ter. 1.</note> which they of

the Iaundiſe: being giuen in the quantitie of two ſpoonefulls. And
in another place he ſaith:<note place="margin">Cap. 157.</note> Some burne the clawes of Swine, and
giue the aſhes to thoſe that are tormented with the collicke, in
drinke. Other ſome ſay, that Aſſes hooues burnt, drunke daily &amp; doe

more might be brought out of <hi>Aetius</hi> concerning theſe things, to
proue that they of olde, did vſe calcinations and aſhes, in diuers and
ſundry maladies. Albeit all aſhes in generall, ſo farre forth as they
containe in them their proper Salt, haue power in them to dry vp,
&amp; to clenſe, yet neuertheleſſe they retaine in them ſome property of
that matter out of the which they are extracted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:24"/>
And this agreeth with that which <hi>Aegineta</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">Lib. 7. de re medica.</note> ſaying:
Aſhes haue not exactly one temperature, but do differ according to
the difference of the matter which is brent. And therfore the aſhes
of ſharp things, as of Oakes, or Holme, do binde very much, and
do ſtoppe the eruption of bloud without any other thing. But the
aſhes of more ſharp things, as of the figge, and Tythimal, or ſpurge,
are more ſharpe and cleanſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oribaſius</hi> wryteth in like manner,<note place="margin">Coll lib. 15.</note> ſauing that he procéedeth
further. For he plainely teacheth the Chymicall extraction of ſalt
out of ſuch aſhes, ſpeaking thus: Aſhes (ſaith hee) haue in them,
partly that which is Earthie, and partly that which is fumie, and
theſe partes are thinne, and the aſhes ſteeped or infuſed in water,
and ſtrayned, do paſſe through together: that which remaineth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
earthie and weake, and without byting, is made hotte, hauing
put of his force in the watering or infuſion. And thus <hi>Oribaſius</hi>
calleth the ſeparation of the actiue from the paſſiue &amp; earthie (which
he calleth infirme, or weake, but the Chymiſts, the deade and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

is this one thing, that out of ſuch kinde of Aſhes (whereof <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſius</hi>
maketh mention) they drawe out the whole water, and drye
it vp: and that which remaineth in the bottome, being impure ſalt,
they diſſolue againe with common water, or with the proper water
thereof, (which is better) diſtilled from it, before the Incineration of
the matter, that they may make the ſame cleane and pure, and as
cleere as Chriſtall. For they diſſolue manie times, they fylter, and
coagulate, not to the vttermoſt poynt of dryneſſe: but drawing out
onely of that water twoo thirde partes and more, by the pipe of the
Alembick, they afterward remooue the ſame from the fire, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

One, I learned of a friend which lodged at my houſe, who
<pb facs="tcp:10505:25"/>
was the firſt Inuentor therof. Another, I receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
&amp; famous <hi>Polonian,</hi> a ſkilfull Phyſitian, aboue 26. yeers ſince.</p>
               <p>This man was ſo excellently, and phyloſophically ſkilfull in
the preparing of the aſhes out of al the parts of any maner of plant,
with all the Tinctures and Impreſſions of all the parts of the
plant, and would in ſuch wiſe conſerue all their Spirites, and
the Authours of all their faculties, that hée had aboue thirtie
ſuch plants prepared out of their aſhes of diuers ſorts, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in their ſeuerall glaſſes, ſealed vp with <hi>Hermes</hi> ſeale, with
the tytle of each particular plant, and the propertie thereof, written
vpon the ſame. So, as that if a man deſired to ſée a Roſe or Mary-gold,
or any other flower, as a red or white Poppey, or ſuch like:
then would hée take the glaſſe wherein the aſhes of ſuch a flower
was incloſed, whether it were of a Roſe, a Marie-golde, a Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,
a Gilly-flower, or ſuch like, according as the writing of the
glaſſe did demonſtrate. And putting the flame of a Candell to the
bottome of the glaſſe, by which it was made hote, you might ſée
that moſt thinne and impalpable aſhes, or ſalt, ſend foorth from the
bottome of the glaſſe, the manifeſt forme of a Roſe, vegetating and
growing by little and little, and putting on ſo fully the forme of
ſtalkes, leaues and flowers, in ſuch perfect and naturall wiſe in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
ſhew, that a man would haue beléeued verily, the ſame to
be naturally corporeat, whereas in truth it was the ſpirituall <hi>Idea,</hi>
indued with a ſpirituall eſſence: which ſerued for no other purpoſe,
but to be matched with his fitting earth, that ſo it might take vnto
it a more ſoly body. This ſhadowed Figure, ſo ſoone as the veſſell
was taken from the fire, turned to his aſhes againe, and vaniſhing
away, became a <hi>Chaos</hi> and confuſed matter.</p>
               <p>When I had ſéene this ſecret, &amp; endeuouring with al my might to
attaine to the ſame, I ſpent much time about it, but yet loſt my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
But as touching the demonſtration following: I affirme vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my faith and credite, to be moſt certaine, and haue often proued
and experimented it by my ſelfe &amp; may eaſily be done by any man.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>de Luynes Formentieres,</hi> a man of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
both for his learning and office, being noble, and of all men
ſingularly beloued, long ſince departed this life: with whom in
his life time, I conuerſed with great familiaritie. This noble man
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:10505:25"/>
ſecrets of nature, but ſpecially thoſe which appertained, either for
the preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or for the reſtoring of health. And ſéeking long to find
ſuch remedies, for that he had languiſhed in a crazed body a great
while without any helpe, and was iudged by Phyſitians to be paſt
cure, he was at the laſt holpen, and wonderfully reſtored to health, by
one only Loſſenge of a certaine Chymical electuary of great vertue,
which the Lady <hi>de la Hone,</hi> a moſt noble and wiſe matrone gaue
vnto him. This <hi>Loſſenge,</hi> prouoked him to eaſie vomit, by which
he caſt vp from his ſtomacke all impurity, tough and diſcous, like
the whites of egs, diuerſly coloured, in great quantitie: by which hee
was reſtored to health againe, to his great ioy and comfort.</p>
               <p>Hereupon he greatly deſireth to know this ſecret, the which he
not onely obtained at the hands of that noble Lady, but ſome others
alſo no leſſe vertuous, by his own endeuour afterwards: the which
he vſed both for his owne health, &amp; alſo for the good of others as need
required, in the way of Chriſtian charity. This man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of

being opened earely in the morning, and the lye clenſed, there
appeared a méere and firme Iſe, wherein there appeared a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
formes of mettalls, with all the parts thereto belonging: as
leaues, ſtalkes, and rootes, being very plaine and apparant to the
eye of the beholders, in ſuch ſort as no man could but acknowledge
them to be mettals.</p>
               <p>When the noble man beheld this, and gazed vpon it, as on a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
he haſtily ranne vnto me, and ſpake to me in the words of
<hi>Archymides,</hi> crying, <hi>I haue found, come, and ſee.</hi> And when
I came into his worke-houſe, I tooke the Iſe, and brake of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

péece, which I handeled ſo warily, that it might not melt with the
warmth of my hand, and carryed it to men of great woorth, which
dwelt with vs in that Citie: who beholding the Iſe, affirmed moſt
conſtantly that they were mettalls, and did no leſſe maruaile then I
my ſelfe did, wondering what it ſhould intende, and from whence,
and how ſo excellent a thing coulde procéede out of Nature: wée all
calling to minde this ſentence of holie writ: <hi>Remember man, that
thou art Aſhes, and to Aſhes againe thou ſhalt returne:</hi> conſidering
that the forces of ſuch things do lye hydde and abide in their aſhes,
from whence the Reſurrection of our Bodies is moſt aſſuredlie to
bée expected.</p>
               <p>This gallant experiment being afterwards oftentimes by mée
wrought, &amp; rightly performed by Art, brought alſo to my minde that
Hiſtory wherof I ſpake before, concerning a <hi>Poleland</hi> Phyſitian:
the which when I ſaw, I ſtroue, and endeuored all that I coulde,
with meditation and practice to bring it to paſſe. And firſt I thought
vpon the reaſons how ſo excellent a woorke might be finiſhed: and
what it was, that gaue forme ſo perfectly to a Roſe, or to any other
Plant, according to the verie life, with all the Naturall colours
thereto belonging, in a moment, occaſioned through a light heate. I
ſay, I had diuers and ſundrie cogitations with my ſelfe how this
thing might bée. And amyddeſt theſe thoughts, and as I was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
in other woorkes, I perceiued that the forme and figure of a
thing is included in his ſalt, without any colour: and that there are
no other colours in water, then waterie, that is to ſay white: And
further, that the mettalls in that I ſée ſhould be deuoid of all colour,
ſauing waterie and white, by reaſon that the Ethereall and Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
ſpirites Vaporous and ſulphurous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do vaniſh away, by their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
and calcination in the Sunne-ſhine, from the which ſpirits
the colours doe ariſe, as is to be ſéene in Salt Niter: which al beit
whyte in ſhewe, yet put into a cloſe Lembic, and ſet ouer the fire in
ſande to be fixed, it ſendeth foorth his flying ſpirits, euen through
the harde bodie of the Alembic, of ſixe hundreth ſeuerall colours, and
cleaning to the vttermoſt part of the veſſell like volatile meale. Sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore there lye hid ſo many ſundrie colours in Salt-peter,
(which is a fatte ſalt of the earth) there is no doubt but that the like
<pb facs="tcp:10505:26"/>
Saltes alſo are contained in all other things, which containe in
them their proper colours alſo drawen out of the power of the
earth, which ſhew foorth themſelues in theyr due ſeaſon by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie
of Art.</p>
               <p>Thus after long deliberation had with my ſelfe, I fullie reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to make tryall hereof. And firſt I tooke one whole ſimple
being in this perfect vigor and ſtrength in the ſpring time, hauing
fulneſſe of Iuice, and impreſſions of vitall tinctures, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are included in the ſpirites of Saltes. This ſimple (I
ſay) I determined to beate in a marble morter, with his ſtalkes,
leaues and flowers, together with the rootes, and ſo to reduce it
into a <hi>Chaos</hi> or confuſed maſſe, &amp; to put it into a veſſell of glaſſe,
cloſed with <hi>Hermes</hi> ſeals, and ſo to remaine to be digeſted, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated,
and fermented a conuenient time, out of the which at the
length I might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> preſeruing with
all diligence the ſpirtes: &amp; out of their mercuriall and ſulphurous
liquor actiue, ſeparating the Elementall water paſſiue, whereby
is extracted out of the drie Feces artificially calcined, a Salt,
brought to the puritie of Chriſtall, which is a moſt white aſhes,
and moſt full of life.</p>
               <p>Then after this, I would put to this Salt by little and little his
Mercuriall liquor, which I would diſtill from it, that I might
conioyne with the fixed ſalte, the volatile armoniac, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in that liquor, and from whome the liquor borroweth his
whole force, which I perceyued to be deteyned and ſwallowed
vp by the fixed ſalte: for ſo nature imbraceth nature, and like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth
with the like, as ſalt with ſalte.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus finiſhed, that is, theſe ſaltes being vnited
together againe, then would I adde by little and little the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous
eſſence, which I would bring into earth ſoliate, that is
to ſay: the moſt ſimple eſſence, full of all vitall Tinctures and
properties.</p>
               <p>But wanting leyſure to go forward in this courſe, I haue not
as yet attayned the vndoubted experience of this ſo noble a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete:
whereof I will make proofe and aſſaye, if God permit,
<pb facs="tcp:10505:27"/>
when occaſion ſhalbe giuen. For ſéeing it is a matter in nature,
and hath bene alreadie done, there is no doubt but that it may
be done againe, by other diligent woorkemen. Neyther doe I
thinke that there can be a more ready way of working prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
than that which I haue already ſpoken of, and which is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
and familiar to true Philoſophers, and Chymiſts. For this
courſe obſerued, euery thing wel wrought, hath his moſt effectual
and actiue vertues, and vital qualities. But ſome other better
learned and more exerciſed in Chymical philoſophy then my ſelfe,
can more readily ſée this thing, and looke further into the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,
who hauing better leyſure, may make trial of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and finde out in very déede the truth and certainty of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice.
Wherunto if any man by his induſtry do attaine, let him
not kepe the ſecrete to himſelfe alone, but let him beſtow the ſame

               <p>For albeit, it is a matter more pleaſant to beholde then profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,

                  </gap>yſte which is called vnſauorie Phleame, is peſtered
with all Sulphur and Mercurie, hauing no odour or taſte, or

               <p>And as theſe are of no force, ſo doe they onely poſſeſſe
paſſiue qualities, and vnprofitable. But <hi>Ayer,</hi> the thyrd Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cannot be ſeparated by it ſelfe, but doth eyther vaniſh into
ayre, or elſe remayneth mixed Sulphur and Mercury, and doth
more chiefely cleaue vnto Mercury, which is ſo ſpiritual, that the
moſt experte woorkeman cannot ſeparate the ſame from it ſelfe
alone, but doth alwayes paſſe away into aire, with the aire or
vapour of that thing, whereof the ſeparation is made: to which
aier Mercury is ſtraitely combyned, that it can neuer be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the ſame, without it be done by the great induſtry of a
ſkilful workeman, who knoweth that Mercury or ſalte Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack
volatile, is ſo conioyned with aier, or with the aiery parts,
that it doth alſo breathe away with the aiery parte, and with the
ſame is reduced into ſpiritual Water, which is knowen to be the
mercurial water, by the ſharpe, ſower, and vehement, which
ſpringeth from the Mercury or ſalt armoniack, of nature ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.
The which the workeman ſéeking to ſeparate, conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
this ſpiritual liquor, with a Chriſtalline ſalt, naturally fixed,
from the which, he ſeparateth that aiery liquor, by Diſtillation,
which by that ſeparation is vtterly ſpoyled of all force, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
an vnſauory aiery liquor, for becauſe that Mercuriall
ſpirite poſſeſſing the nature of volatil Salt, remaineth fixed,
with his proper Salt, with the which hée hath the moſt chiefe
analogie and proportion. And thus the Philoſophers teſtify,
that nature is delighted with nature.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſée how the Elementary aier is to be ſeparated
from that Mercuriall ſpirite, namely by bringing the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ment
of aier, into water deuoyde of taſte, and by cutting the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
<pb facs="tcp:10505:28"/>
ſpirit, into the ſalt, of his proper preheminence.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, hereby it appeareth, that Mercury is a certaine
aiery thing, or aier it ſelfe: and yet ſomewhat more then the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie
aier, which wanting the ſpirit of Mercurie, is a ſimple
aiery liquor of no vertue or power, but ſimplie to moyſten and
penetrate. And ſo the actiue qualities doe belong to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
Salt, ſulphur, and Mercurie, and the paſſiue to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
This thing wée haue made plaine before, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Wine, and Water of life. Theſe things are therefore
ſpoken, that all men may ſée by the Anatomie and reſolution of
things, that the element of aier, cannot be ſeparated by it ſelfe
alone, neyther is it ſo to be ſéene of any, but of the true Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and by ſuch as are moſt conuerſant in this art.</p>
               <p>Thus certaine demonſtration is made of the viſible bodies of
things procreated, both out of the ſéedes and beginnings, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
out of the elements; albeit in the reſolution of the bodies, thou
doeſt not diſcerne the viſible bodies of the ſéedes, put a parte by
themſelues. But it is an eaſie matter to diſcerne the ſeuered
partes of thoſe thrée beginnings, and alſo of the Elements, in the
which partes of the thrée beginnings, the vertues and powers of
actions (wherwith the ſéedes are indued) are included and mixed
together. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that their bodies are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together with the vitall forces and faculties of the Aſtrall and
ſpirituall ſéedes, as the receptacle of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe vertues.</p>
               <p>But the Elementall bodies, haue only paſſiue qualities: the
which elementall bodies, a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rkeman cannot onely ſeparate by
themſelues, but can alſo bring them to nothing, in ſuch ſorte that
the paſſiue and materiall Elements being ſeparated, there ſhall
onely remaine thoſe thrée Hypoſtaticall, Formall, and Actiue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
ſalt, ſulphur, and mercury, which being drawen into
one body, do make a mixed body, which the Philoſophers call a
fifth or a fourth Eſſence, which is frée from all corruption, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with quickening ſpirits: whereas contrariwiſe, the ſole ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſeparated from thoſe thrée beginnings, doe bring nothing
but impurities, corruptions, and mortification.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Chymeſtry</hi> is to be extolled, that imitating nature, it
<pb facs="tcp:10505:28"/>
rateth Elements, and their beginnings, by which all the partes
of a compund body, are anatomized and made manifeſt. And
yet thoſe naturall ſubſtances, are not ſaid to be begotten, by ſuch
ſeparations, as if they were not before: neyther yet as bring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
are they corrupted by the arte of ſeparation, but they were
in compounde, and after ſeparation, they ceaſed not to bee, and
to ſubſiſt. And as the thrée beginnings are coupled together, by
the benefite of an oylelie liquor ioyning them in one: ſo the thrée
Elements, Ayer, Water, and Earth, are combyned together, by
the comming in of Water as a meane. For water by her ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
and conuenience partaketh both of the na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure of aier, and
of earth: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that one while it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
turned into aier, another while into earth: and ſo it comby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
both the extreames. In things that haue likeneſſe, an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is eaſily made. For, by reaſon of likeneſſe and conſent,
aier made thicke with colde, paſſeth into water, and water made
thinne, becommeth aier: and water alſo made groſſe and thick,
becommeth earth: euen as earth alſo made thinne, paſſeth into
water, and is chaunged.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, forſomuch as aier and earth, two extreames, are
fitlie ioyned together, by a thyrd, which is water, a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
them both: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did more than was néedefull to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt
a quaternarie number of Elements, out of the quaternary
number of the fower qualities, Hote, Colde, Drie, Moyſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
it cannot be denied but that he had great probability hereof,
as is to be ſéene in his ſecond booke of the generation of liuing
creatures, where he goeth about by many reaſons to prooue, that
it is moſt neceſſary for the production of things, to appoynt a
fourth element, namely Fyer, hote and drie.</p>
               <p>But forſomuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> in the firſt Chapt. of his <hi>Geneſis</hi>
(wherein he ſheweth the creation of all things) maketh no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

opinion of the diuine Prophet, then to the reaſons of an <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
Philoſopher. And therfore wée acknowledge no other Fier
then Heauen, &amp; the fiery Region which is ſo called of burning.</p>
               <p>Therefore it ought to be called the fourth formall Heauen,
<pb facs="tcp:10505:29"/>
and eſſential element, or rather the fourth eſſence, extracted out of

deny that there is a quinteſſence becauſe there are not
fower elements, from whence there may be drawen a fifth eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
but thrée onely and no more, out of which a fourth may be

               <p>But let no man thinke here, that when I name the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
ſtone, (that is to ſay, that vniuerſal medicine) that I meane
the tranſmutation of metalls, as if ſuch tranſmutation, were the
chéefe medicine of mans body: but knowe rather, that in Man,

               <p>The Phiſitian therefore, muſt diligently conſider two things,
that is to ſaye, that Nature may be diſquieted, both by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

he muſt foreſée, that Nature be not formented with the outward
enemie, which then commeth to paſſe, when a medecine is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred

therefore contrary to our nature and ſpirites. Then on the other

is aſſayled by two enemies, that is to ſay, by the externall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,

               <p>As touching the Elements of Ayer, the beginnings thereof

               <p>Now as concernining Earth which is ayerie, it is ſo
ſubtill and thinne, that it is very hard to be ſéene, being diffuſed
throughout the whole Region of the Ayer: which doth not

manie kindes of Sulphurs, of Pitche, and of Bitumen, and of

thereof doth make manifeſt. The Earth, alſo doth prooue the
ſame, which being like vnto a ſpunge, doth continually draw and
ſucke vnto it the ſalte body thereof: Wherby it cometh to paſſe,
that there are ſo many kindes of metalls and Mineralls therin.
From this Marine ſale, as from the Father and firſt original,
all other ſates are deryued. And theſe beginnings are ſo ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in all other Elementes by themſelues aparte, that no one of
them is depryued of the company of another. For in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine

be made plaine. For hée which is a meane <hi>Chymiſt</hi> knoweth

which remaineth is Salt. Thus you ſee plainely that theſe thrée

For the other being mixed with the more groſſe ſubſtances

that they conſiſt of many vnkindly parts, with the which theſe

               <p>Of thoſe thrée beginnings aforeſaid, all metalls are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

by the old Philoſophers, by the name of the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Planet.</p>
               <p>So copper hath great ſtore of Sulphur, but leſſe burning then
that of yron, and it hath alſo much vitriol ſalt, yet but little quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie

of nature, whereby the generations of all naturall things
are propagated and increaſed: whereupon the name of <hi>Venus</hi> is
giuen to Copper: in whom there is a ſecond quaternarie among
the Planets, where are heaped vp, nouriſhed, and coagulated
ſpiritually all celeſtiall eſſences: wherefore this Planet by all the

               <p>Tinne hath in it much ethereall and aiery Mercury, but of

becauſe that Planet is altogether aiery and ethereall: and
therefore Poets appoint him king of the aier, and the region of

               <p>Gold and ſiluer, which of all other metalls are moſt noble and
perfit, do alſo conſiſt of the thrée foreſaid beginnings, but yet mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in equalitie, and ſo perfectly with great purity vnited, that it
may ſéeme that there is one chiefe and firſt eſſence onely in them,
and not thrée, of which they conſiſt. For theyr <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and

<pb facs="tcp:10505:34"/>
the name of the Sunne is giuen to gold, becauſe in very déede
it is an ethereall fier and brightneſſe. For the Sunne is a moſt

               <p>This vertue of conſuming the bodies of imperfect metalls, it

which it doth abound: whereas otherwiſe by the nature of his
Sulphur, it is able to doe the contrarie: that is to ſay, to coagulate
thoſe metallick ſpirits, and to reduce them into bodies, euen as
quickſiluer being altogether flying by nature, etheriall, and truly
Homogeny and ſpirituall, doth after a ſort congeale and fire. So
that hereby it appeareth, that it hath in it by nature, the ſpirit of
heat and of cold, and therefore of metallick life and death: which
maketh the ſentence of <hi>Hermes</hi> good, when he ſaid, that which is

               <p>Thus the way is prepared for true Phyloſophers, to attaine
to that great and moſt excellent minerall worke, and to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of that vniuerſal medicine out of mineralls. And this is
the demonſtration, by which in all metalls and concrete bodies,
thoſe thrée beginnings are to be ſearched out, and being by art
ſeperated, are to be ſet before our eyes. The which to make it
more plaine, I thought good to vſe the example of lead, which of
all men is reiected as moſt vile, whereas notwithſtanding the

the ſame alſo in another place to the matter of gold, concerning
whoſe vertues and effects he deliuereth wondere: as that it is
the higheſt and moſt perfect purger of gold, and his Mercury, of
men. His red Sulphur alſo doth plainly appeare, which hath his
property, that it wil take fier and burne like common Sulphur or
Brimſtone: the which is eſpecially to be ſéene in the night, &amp; in a
darke place, without any ſume, which the common Sulphur is
woont to ſend forth. This Sulphur of Antimony is Solary, and
ſuch as is able to gild the ſuperficial part of ſiluer.</p>
               <p>As touching the Salt of Antimony, it is to be ſeperated from
the ſame, whoſe property conſiſteth in procuring vomit. For his
ſtrength to procure vomit lyeth hid in the ſalte flowers thereof:
from the which flowers, if the ſalt betaken away &amp; ſeperated by
vertue of a certaine ſalt, as may be done, then out of the flowers
thereof, is made a moſt excellent purgation without vomiting.</p>
               <p>But the property of the Mercury thereof bringeth no ſmal
wonder, which in the liquation or melting of gold with other
metalls, reiecteth them al, and chooſeth the gold to it ſelfe, with
the which it is mingled and vnited into one body, in ſuch wiſe,
that it ſwalloweth vp gold, whereas all other metalls (except ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer)

whatſoeuer it bée, that hath being, within the whole compaſſe

               <p>And whereas ſome are ſaid to be mercurial, ſome Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
and ſome Salt, it is therefore, becauſe the Mercurials doe
conteine more Mercurie, the Sulphurus more Sulphur, and
the Saltiſh more Salt in them than the others. For ſome whole
trées are to be ſéene more ſulphurus and roſeny than other ſome,
as the Pine and Firre-trées, which are alwayes gréene in the

beginning, being the principal vital inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For there are ſome other plants, as the Lawrel, and the
Trées of Oranges, Citrons and Lemons, which continue long
gréene, and yet are ſubiect to colde: becauſe their Sulphure is
not ſo eaſily diſperſed, as is the Sulphur of the firre trées, which
are roſeny, and are therefore thrice of a more fixed and conſtant
life, furniſhed againſt the iniuries of times. Furthermore, al

And as there are ſundry ſortes of trées of this kinde, ſo

ſearched by the Art of <hi>Chymiſtrie,</hi> in his interior Anatomy,
with the ſeparation of the beginnings, it may alſo be made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to ſenſe. For Mercury is extracted out of euery thing, firſt
of all in his diſſection or ſeparation, into a watery vapour: and
Sulphur into an oyely: thirdly, out of the remaining feces,
brought into aſhes, a Salt is extracted, by his proper water,
which being moſt white, &amp; like to cryſtall, hath the taſte of ſharpe,
ſower, &amp; byting ſalt, or ſuch like reliſh in the mouth: wherby it is
found to be true ſalte, which may be diſſolued in water, according
to the maner of true ſalts: differing ſo much from the other aſhes,
as life from death: for as much as the feces that remaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
are called dead earth, whereas this is repleniſhed with vitall

               <p>To conclude, in euery kind of plant, &amp; in all the partes thereof,
thriſe thrée beginnings are inſet and cleauing, indued with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry

Anatomy of things, which ſhew eaſily by the impreſſion of

it ſelfe vnto vs. That oyle, I ſay, of the Boxe, albeit it

                     </gap>yre,</hi>
it wil manifeſtly appeare, (although it do burne in water) by his
vnpleaſaunt odour, that it hath a cooling propertie in it, and
<pb facs="tcp:10505:38"/>
narcocal or ſtupefactiue: whoſe oyle alſo, is a good mittigator of
paines and griefe: when as notwithſtanding it ſheweth foorth
contrary effects, as at the very firſt brunt, it ſéemeth to haue a
certaine fierie qualitie. By reaſon of the propertie which it hath
to aſſwage paines and aches, the <hi>Arabians</hi> iudged the ſame to
colde in the third degrée. The experience thereof is eaſily to bée
ſéene in the ache of the téeth. For if a hollow or rotten toothe, bée
but touched with the oyle thereof, it putteth away the paine.
The ſame oyle is a moſt preſent remedie in paines and griefe
of the reynes, cauſed by the ſtone. For thereby the ſtone is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and auoyded, if it be miniſtred with competent liquor.</p>
               <p>Other are the properties of other Oyles: For the oyles or
Sulphurs of Annis, and of Fennel, are fit to diſpearce and driue
away windineſſe.</p>
               <p>The Oyles of Cloues, of Nutmegges, of Cinamon, and of
other ſpices and their Sulphurs, as alſo the Oyles of Mynts, of
<hi>Ambroſia,</hi> of <hi>Sage,</hi> and <hi>Betony,</hi> and of ſuch like, are conuenient
to corroberat, and to warme the braine and ſtomach.</p>
               <p>So the ole of Pepper, doth attenuat, make thinne, diſſolue
and cut tartarus matters in the body, and humours that are
niter Sulphurus and Cholerick. And howſoeuer many doe

               <p>In like ſort hote and burning oyles, may be extracted out the
ſéedes of Poppey, Goordes, Melous, Cucumbers, and ſuch like
cold things, whoſe operations notwithſtanding doe not bring

               <p>And the mercurial ſpirits of vegetables, are oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned

Pearles.</p>
               <p>Out of the which Mercural ſharpe liquors, may alſo be made
ſundry ſeueral remedies, apt, both to ferment, digeſt, and attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
humours, and alſo to mooue ſweate, and to prouoke vrine,
to breake and driue forth the ſtone, and very good to cure other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
eſpecially ſuch as are Mercurial.</p>
               <p>Now leauing to ſpeake of Mercuries and Sulphurs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſhal be ſayd of Salts: It hath béene already declared, that
generally they ſerue for the general purgation and euacuation of
bodyes: whether they mooue ſegges, Vrines, or prouoke vomit
or ſweates: or whether they doe clenſe, cut, open, or any other
way helpe obſtructions.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, as betwéene Sulphurs and Sulphurs,
and betwéene Mercuries and Mercuries, there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
ſo is there great varietie of Salts, and much difference
of their vertues and operations. As for example, the ſalt of the
coddes of Beanes, amongſt others is excéeding cauſticke and
burning: yet being giuen in drie quantitie in broath, it is very
diaphoretical, or diſſoluing, in ſuch wiſe, that nothing can worke
more effectual without hurt or offence of the bowels.</p>
               <p>The Salt of the Aſh-trée, doth moſt mightily open obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
moſt chiefely ſitting the diſeaſes of the ſpléene.</p>
               <p>The Saltes of <hi>Artemiſia,</hi> (otherwiſe called the mother of
Hearbes, and <hi>Mugwoort)</hi> and of <hi>Sauin,</hi> are moſt fit to procure
the menſtrues of women.</p>
               <p>The Salt of <hi>Gammock,</hi> otherwiſe called Reſt-harrow, Petty
whynne, or ground Furze: the ſalt of <hi>Saxifage, Gromel,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
called <hi>Pearle plant,</hi> of <hi>Radiſh,</hi> are very proper remedies
to breake the ſtone, and to clenſe the kydneys and bladder, from
ſand.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Salts <hi>Double leafe,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Gooſeneſt,</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:10505:39"/>
clot Burre, and of <hi>Cardus Benedictus,</hi> which are diaphoricall, or
diſſoluing.</p>
               <p>The Salts of Mynt, and Woorme-wood, are good to purge
the lappets and tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

comfort the ſame. So the Salt of <hi>Guaiacine,</hi> is by a ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
ſolutiue: as the mercurie thereof by his tartneſſe doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie:
and the oyle or Sulphur thereof hath a purging force.</p>
               <p>Out of the which thrée beginnings, if the firſt two ſpirituall

(which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Elixir)</hi> it will be ioyntly together a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine

Which tryple motion and operation commeth from one and the
ſame eſſence of thrée vnited in one, giuing moſt aſſured helpe, in
ſtéed of quicke-ſiluer, againſt the veneril ſickneſſe, or French diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
               <p>The ſalt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> is of the ſame kinde that they be, which
ſharply do vite the tongue, being alſo oily and ſulphurus: yea, it
is more ſharpe than any other: neuertheles if it be mingled with
the ſpirit or ſharpe oile of vitriole, it can ſo moderate and correct
his ſharpeneſſe and byting ſpirit, that of them both there may be
made Ielly, and thereof a ſwéete &amp; moſt pleaſing delicate ſirup,
which auayleth much againſt the gnawing and heate of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and to eaſe al paines of the collicke.</p>
               <p>All ſuch Mercuries, Sulphur, and Saltes of Vegetables, doe
grow and ariſe from the mercurial and ſulphurus ſpirits of the
earth, and from metallick ſubſtances, but they are farre better,
ſwéeter, and of more noble condition than their parents, from
whence they take their original.</p>
               <p>There wil be no ende of writing, if particularly ſhould bée
proſecuted, the difference of all beginnings, and their properties
and faculties, which the ſea and the earth doth procreate. That
which is already declared may ſuffice to ſtirre vp the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, we wil beginne with Fowles, whoſe
firſt beginning is at the Egge. For in
Egges there are more plaine teſtimonies
of the nature of Birdes, than in any other
thing. The white declareth the ethereal
Mercurie, wherein is the ſéed and the ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
ſpirit, the author of generation, hauing
in the prolifying power, whereof chiefly the
Bird is begotten. For this cauſe it is marueilous, that ſo many
and ſo great diſſoluing and attenuating vertues and faculties,
doe lye hid in the white of an Egge, as in the ethereal Mercurie.</p>
               <p>The yeolke of the Egge, (the nouriſhment of the Bird) is the
true Sulphur. But the thinne ſkinne and the ſhell, doe not onely
conteyne a certaine portion of Salt, but alſo their whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is ſalt: and the ſame the moſt fixed and conſtant of al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſalts of nature, ſo as the ſame being brought vnto blackneſſe,
and freed from his combuſtible ſulphur, but calcination, it will
indure and abide all force of fyer, which is a propertie belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to the moſt fixed ſalts, and a token of their aſſured and moſt
conſtant fixion. This ſalt daily prepared, is very fit to diſſolue
and breake the Stone, and to auoyd it.</p>
               <p>As theſe thrée principles are in the Egge, ſo they paſſe into the
bird. For Mercury is in the blood and fleſh: Sulphur in the fat
and ſalt, is in the ligaments, ſinewes, bones, &amp; more in ſolid parts.</p>
               <p>And the ſame beginnings, are more ſubtil and aierie in birds,
than in fiſhes, and terreſtrials. As for example, the Sulphur
<pb facs="tcp:10505:40"/>

               <p>The ſame may be ſayd of Fiſhes, which albeit they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
and nouriſhed in the cold water, yet doe they not want
their hote and burning fatneſſe, apt to burne. And that they haue
in them Mercury and Salt, no man well aduiſed, will denie.</p>
               <p>All terreſtriall liuing creatures doe conſiſt in like ſort of theſe
thrée beginnings: but in a more noble degrée of perfection, than
in vegetable things, they doe appeare in them. For the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

are con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

they are made more perfect, and of greater efficacie.</p>
               <p>In Vegetables, there were onely thoſe Vegetatiues: which in
beaſtes beſide the vegetation which they retaine, they become

               <p>The Sulphur appeareth in them, by their greaſe, tallow, and
by their vnctuous, oily, marrow, and fatneſſe, apt to burne.
Their Salts are repreſented by their bones and more ſolid and

and in their other humors, and vaporous ſubſtances. All which
thoſe ſingular partes, are not therefore called Mercurie, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs,

made man after all other things, that he might expreſſe in
man, as in a ſmall table, all that he had made before at large.</p>
               <p>For as the vniuerſal frame of this world is diuided into theſe
thrée parts, namely intellectual, and elementarie, the meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
which is the celeſtial, which doth couple the other two,
not onely moſt diuers, but alſo cleane contrary, that is to ſay,
that ſupreme intellectual wholy formal and ſpiritual, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
material and corporeat: ſo in man the like triple world
is to be conſidered, as it is diſtributed into thrée parts, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
moſt ſtraightly knit together and vnited: that is to ſay,
the Head, the Breſt, and the Belly beneath. The which lower
belly comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth thoſe parts which are appointed for genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and nouriſhment, which is correſpondent to the lower e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementarie
world. The middle part, which is the breſt, where
the heart is ſeated, the fountaine of all motions of life, and of
heat, reſembleth that celeſtial middle world, which is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of life, of heat, and of all motions: in the which the Sunne
<pb facs="tcp:10505:41"/>
hath the preheminence, as the heart in the breſt. But the higheſt
and ſupreme parte which is the head, or the braine, containeth
the original of vnderſtanding, of knowledge, and is the ſeate of
reaſon, like vnto the ſuprem intellectual world, which is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
world. For by this part man is made partaker of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
nature of vnderſtanding, of the féeling and vegetating
ſoule, and of all the celeſtial functions, formal and incorruptible:
when as otherwiſe his elementary world, is altogether croſſe,
material, and terreſtrial.</p>
               <p>And as man, as touching his ſubſtancial forme, poſſeſſeth all
the faculties of the ſoule, and their degrées, that is to ſay, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
which is vegelatiue: the animal, which is ſenſatiue and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:
and the Rational, which God inſpired into man, when hée
had made him: euery of the which thrée contained vnder them,
thrée other inferiours, whereof to ſpeake in this place is néedleſſe:
ſo as concerning the material body of man, there are in him thrée
radical and balſanick eſſences, out of the which, both the contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
parts of the body, as the fleſhy and more ſolid, and alſo
the contained parts, that is to ſay, the ſpiritual and fluible parts,
are made, compacted, nouriſhed, and doe draw their life.</p>
               <p>Salt in them, is the radical beginning of all the ſolyd parts: as
being alſo in the animal ſéede, it compacteth and congealeth the
ſolid parts, ſo as it is accounted the foundation of the whole
frame.</p>
               <p>But the radical beginning of ſwéete Sulphur in the animal,
which is the natural, moiſt, original, oylelike, ſheweth it ſelfe, in
the fat, greaſe, and marrow, and ſuch other parts, as wel hidden
as manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The radical Mercury, wholy ſpiritual and ethereal, which is
that inſet and natural ſpirit of euery part and member, the next
inſtrument of the ſoule, doth no leſſe declare it ſelfe, in maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and concerning the animal life, as being the very ſame,
which from the ſoule is the life powred into the body, which the
Sulphurus part nouriſheth and ſuſtaineth.</p>
               <p>Theſe thrée radical eſſences ſhut vp in the ſéed of the animal,
which we haue ſet forth in the framing of man, both according
<pb facs="tcp:10505:41"/>
to forme and matter, doe procreate in his members thrée kindes
of ſpirits and faculties. The firſt faculty is that which is called
natural or vegetal, which being chiefely ſeated in the liuer, taketh
conſeruation and nouriſhment from Salt, that firſt radical be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and baſe of the others. The vital faculty ſeated in the
heart is cheriſhed and ſuſtained by a Sulphurus liquor, the
which liquor is the natural moyſture and fountaine of heate and
of life. The animal faculty, wholy Mercurial, ethereal and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and the principal inſtrument of the functions of the ſoule, is
placed in the braine: which is defended and conſerued by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
the third radical beginning, which is wholy ethereal and
ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>Hereby it is plaine, that theſe radical ſpirits, or ſubſtancial
and formal beginnings of things, doe ſo mutually embrace one
the other, and which is more, the one wil beget the other.</p>
               <p>But the terreſtrial and ſolid Salt which is diſcerned to be in
the bones, and in other hard parts, doth compact and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his gluing force, the more ſoft parts with the hard: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as a windy ſpirit, or windy ayer ſhut vp in euery body, doth
make a liuing body more light and nimble, then a dead carkaſſe.
The which qualities and faculties are wholy elementary, as
procéeding rather from matter then forme.</p>
               <p>And thus briefely is ſhewed the thrée beginnings of man and
their faculties and powers.</p>
               <p>The body thus compacted and made of theſe thrée begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
hath néede of his daily foode and nouriſhment, whereby it
may be preſerued. Which nouriſhment cannot be ſupplyed
from any other, then from thoſe things, which are of the ſame
nature, whereof it conſiſteth. For we are nouriſhed with thoſe
things whereof it conſiſt. Neuertheleſſe for ſo much as the bodie
is weak &amp; tender by his firſt original, it is not to be fed with the
more hard food, but with meat which wil eaſily be concocted and
turne to nouriſhment, containing theſe thrée beginnings.</p>
               <p>Such milke which is giuen to Infants to ſuck, without art or
labour, doth plainly enough ſhew his thrée beginnings. For the
butter ſheweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſulphurus ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whay ſheweth mercurial:
<pb facs="tcp:10505:42"/>
and the chéeſe his ſaltiſh beginning. This milke being of one
and the ſame eſſence, contayning theſe three ſubſtances, is eaſily
concocted in the ſtomack of the Infant, and is firſt turned into a
white iuice, and then into blood. The which blood, poſſeſſeth that
which is more formal and radical in theſe beginnings, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and abiecting the reſt into feces and excrement. Alſo the
ſame blood being carried into the heart, by the veyne called <hi>Vena
Cana,</hi> which is as it were the Pellican of nature, or the veſſel
circulatory, is yet more ſubtilly concocted, and obtaineth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as it were of quinteſſence, or of a Sulphurus burning Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vita,
which is the original, which is the original of natural &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
heat. The ſame Aquanita being carried from hence by
the arteries into the <hi>Balneum Maris</hi> of the braine, is there exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againe, in a wonderful maner by circulations: and is there
changed into a ſpirit truly ethereal and heauenly, from whence
the animal ſpirit procéedeth, the chiefe inſtrument of the ſoule,
for that it commeth more néere to that ſame ſpiritual nature, then
doe the other two beginnings. For as from wine, thoſe thrée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
are extracted by a ſkilful workeman (the which alſo
may be done out of milke, with leſſe labour) ſo in blood (which
we rightly compare to wine) are thoſe thrée beginnings, which
by nature her ſelfe, executing the office of a true <hi>Alchymiſt,</hi> hath
prudently and ſeuerally diſtributed and diſpearced into all the
parts of the bodie, in ſuch meaſure as is fitting to euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
giuing to the bones, ſinewes and ligaments, more plenty of
the ſalt ſubſtance, then of the others: to the fat, greaſe, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
the ſubſtance Sulphurus: and to the fleſh and humours
which come out of blood, and to the nouriſhing and natural ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
whether fixed, flowing, or wandring, a greater plenty of the
Mercurial ſpirit.</p>
               <p>That firſt age of infancie ouerpaſſed, and greater ſtrength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
increaſed to concoct and digeſt meat, then the ſtomack offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
it ſelfe to more ſolyd and firme ſuſtenance, as to bread, wine,
and ſuch like, comming as wel out of the ſtore of vegetables, as
of animals, fed and ſuſtained by the ſame vegetables, which are
paſſed into an animal nature, that is to ſay ſenſatiue, euen as a
<pb facs="tcp:10505:42"/>
mineral ſubſtance is brought into a vegetatiue.</p>
               <p>It is afore ſhewed, that the vegetables and animals appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for mans ſubſtance, doe change and come into his ſubſtance
and nature with their beginnings whereof they conſiſted: ſo as
they being deuoured and concocted, and turned into that white
iuice called Chylus, and ſpred and diſtributed into the liuer, hart,
and braine, by diuers degrées of concoctions &amp; circulations, that
at the length they are changed into ſpirits, natural, vitall, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
mercurial, ſulphurus, and ſaltiſh ethereal, and ſpirituous: by
reaſon whereof man is preſerued, and continueth in his ſtate,
vnto his predeſtinated time: hereof alſo may be gathered and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
the original and generation of the thrée humours, which
come both from the mixture of theſe beginnings, and alſo of the
Elements. Which are no leſſe different and varying one from
the other, whether it be in perfection, or in imperfection, then are
thoſe thrée beginnings different in the degrees of perfection.
The firſt of the profitable humours, whereof we are purpoſed to
ſpeake, is that Chylus or white Iuice, which is effected and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in the ſtomack, and in the vaines next adioyning, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the meſaraic vaines by the firſt concoction: the ſame Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
conſiſting of thoſe three beginnings, but as yet very impure,
whereof the firſt beginnings of nouriſhment are: and the ſame
is the firſt digeſtion and ſeperation of the pure from the impure,
of thoſe thrée formal beginnings, and of the thrée material ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The ſecond of the profitable humours, is blood, aryſing out of
the Chylus, (which is a good iuice) being of the firſt degrée of the
concocting heat of the liuer, and of the vaines: whereof commeth
a ſecond concoction, and ſeperation of the pure from the impure,
notwithſtanding of the formal and matertal eſſence, which is far
more ſubtil and noble then the firſt concoction and ſeperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The third of the humours, is that which after ſundry retera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the circulations, made by the much vital heate of the
heart; doth very farre excéede in perfection of concoction: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two, which may be called the elimentary or nouriſhing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb facs="tcp:10505:43"/>
of life, and radical Sulphur: the which is diſperced by the
arteries throughout the whole body, and is turned into the
whole body, and is turned into the whole ſubſtance thereof, out
of the moſt perfect concoction of all the other; which is the third,
and is called the aſſimilation or reſemblance, of the nouriſhment
or nouriſhed.</p>
               <p>It is certaine that this humour, is moſt eſpecially partaker of
the puritie of the thrée beginnings, and doth reſemble the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
animal Aquauita, which is ſeperated from al paſſiue element
of the animal wine, that is to ſay, of the blood. For the blood,
(which we haue already ſaid to be the ſecond profitable humour,
and by vs compared to pure and refined wine) is freed from the
greater part of his terreſtrial tartar, whoſe thrée beginnings alſo
doe exceed the Chylus in puritie. Out of which thrée beginnings
by a third concoction and digeſtion, the Sulphurus animal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quauita,
the aiery and moſt ſubtil ſpirit, together with the Salt,
depured and made thinne, with diuers circulations alſo, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
concoctions, are extracted. The which being ſo extracted,
that which reſteth in the blood (as alſo in wine) is water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſauour or taſt, and a Sulphurus tartarlike, and impure fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which procéed from out of the material elements. In blood,
ſuch are theſe; cold, moyſt, &amp; mercurial fleame: yealow, hote, dry,
and Sulphurus choller: and melancholy or black choler, not cold,
but hote, dry and ſaltiſh, which are the ecremental parts of thoſe
more pure ſubſtances. And yet the ſame lye not altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
for that they retayning ſomthing out of the actiue qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
both of the thrée beginnings, and alſo of the elements, doe
ſerue for ſomewhat, ſo far forth as they are material. For choller
in that it is introſulphurus, moſt hote and bitter, eſpecially that
which is of the gaule ouerflowing in the capacity or place of the
bowels, prouoketh the facultie expulſiue to caſt out. But the
fleame which is ſower &amp; mercurial, is profitable to ſtirre vp fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation

which is as it were the dregges of the humour of blood, hauing
a certaine analogie and ſimilitude with vineger made out of
<pb facs="tcp:10505:43"/>
wine. For it ſerueth for the firſt concoction of meates, through
the vertue of a certaine internal and vitriolated fier lying hid
in ſuch a ſharpe humour, which being ſtirred vp and ſet on edge
with the heate of the ſtomack, doth readily and quickly confect
and deſtroy the meates, and doth with ſo great force conſume
and deuour ſometime, when it doth ſuperabound, that many
times it bringeth a doglike appetite.</p>
               <p>And thoſe excrements which are altogether ſuperfluous, and
a burden to nature, will confirme the truth hereof: The which
excrements are ſuch as are ſeperated, partly from theſe thrée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
and partly from the elements, namely the mercuriall
vapours, the Sulphurus breathings, and the ſaltiſh exhalations,
which paſſe through the ſkinne by ſweates, euen as Mercury
and Sulphur doe vaniſh away by an infenſible tranſpiration.
If ſuch ſeperation of excrements be made by little and litle, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any violence, they doe prolong a happy age euen to extreame
decrepity. But if on a ſodaine, and with a more violent force, of
ſome more vehement motion, or ſickneſſe, as of inflamation or
of a burning feauer, they be thruſt out, then they ſhorten age,
and doe haſten old age, or elſe doe caſt headlong into vntimely
death by ſoundings and faintings. Moreouer, if ſuch kinde of
excrements be retained in the body, and are ſtayed by ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
from their outgoing, by reaſon of ſome external cauſe,
as the coldneſſe of the weather, which doth harden and thicken
the ſkinne, or by reaſon of cooling dyet, bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they become the ſéedes and rootes of ſundry and infinite ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of the moſt vile and filthy excrements,
and of the groſſe dregs of the elementary matter, together vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
terreſtrial and filthy.</p>
               <p>For out of watery, crude, and thinne excrements: out of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
aiery, and windy: finally out of the more groſſe and
earthie, or moſt ſtinking excrements, how corrupt ſoeuer they
<pb facs="tcp:10505:44"/>
be, yet there are bewrayed in either of them certaine prints of
their defects, which the more pure ſubſtance of the three begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
procreated, from the which the impure at the length are
ſeparated.</p>
               <p>If any man wil make trial of the due Anatomie of theſe things
as (amongſt others) of vrine, which in ſickeneſſes is diligently
viewed and obſerued, he ſhall finde therein a great quantitie of
Mercurial liquor, ſharpe, ſubtil and pearcing, which wil diſſolue
the moſt ſolid and hard bodies: as alſo he ſhal finde great plenty
of a ſulphurus eſſence conceiuing flames: that I may ſay nothing
of the body of Salt, which is euidently enough to be ſéene in that
great plentie of Salt, which is extracted from the ſame. The
which Salt hath ſo great ſharpneſſe, biting, and coroding force
and vehemencie, that it is more forcible and ſtrong than all other
ſalts of nature.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are moſt true, and euident to be ſéene in the
Writings of <hi>Chryſtophorus Pariſienſis,</hi> a moſt famous Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
who hath taken great paines in ſetting foorth the ſeuerall
parts of Vrines.</p>
               <p>They which ſhal ſearch diligently in the building and frame of
mans body, for another thing than the elements &amp; their qualities,
that is to ſay, hote and colde, moyſt, and drie: namely, for a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial

the colours, taſtes, and odours, and ſuch other things of infinite
varietie doe ſpring, ſhal eaſily vnderſtand, that euery one of the
beginnings by his temperature or the excurreth out of their
conſort, doe procreat ſickneſſes of diuers ſorts in the bodie: as if
ſulphur doe too much excéed, then it bringeth on inflamations and
feuers of diuers ſorts, beſide other ſtupefactiue and drouſie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
which the ſtupefactiue ſulphur ſtirreth vp, out of the ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factiue
and drunken ſpirits which it containeth within the ſame,
and being exceſſiue, ſpreadeth it ſelfe throughout the whole body.</p>
               <p>The which is eaſily to be ſeen in ſuch as drinke too much wine,
and in eating of bread that hath much darnel in it: as alſo in the

The which effects, if they be accompanied with any poyſon, or
maligne &amp; contagious ſpirits, they cannot but muſt néedes bring
on, peſtilential; venemous, and contagious diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>If they looke diligently into Salts, they ſhal find, that from
them doe ariſe inward gnawings, Impoſtums, vlcers, diſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
fluxes, the Pemoxoides, and ſuch like, ſo often as they runne
out of their ſeates, and are ſeperated from the other beginnings,
or doe excéed the meaſure of nature, from whence alſo doe come
great annoyances to the body, as by their reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the burnings
of vrine, ſtranguries, and ſuch like. For according to the variety
of Salts, diuers kindes of vlcers, impoſtumes, and other diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as diuers kindes of Collickes, doe ariſe by their ſharpe and
ſower ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Alſo by the coagulation and congealing of theſe Salts, are
ingendered ſwellings, ſtones, and knots of the ſinewes, and an
infinit ſort of abſtructions, whereof many ſickneſſes doe ariſe.
The which coagulated Salts or tartar, forſomuch as they neuer
want their Mercury and Sulphur, rude indigeſted, and impure,
if they be out of meaſure, and doe reach to the vppermoſt degrée
of their malignitie, they wil commixe according to their ſundry
natures and properties, diuers effects, the which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
wil ſéeke to come to the full ſickneſſe of the qualities and
forces of euery of the beginnings, which are alſo wrapped and
infolded the one within the other.</p>
               <p>And herein wee depart not from the opinion of <hi>Hypocrates,</hi>
which he hath ſhewed in his booke concerning the auncient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.
For he reiecting their opinion, which tye the beginnings
and cauſes of ſickneſſes to the elementarie qualities, layeth other
foundations, namely, Swéet, Sower, Bitter, and Salt, the which
we reduce to thoſe thrée beginnings of all things, arrogating to
euery of them their ſingular faculties and properties. For what
<pb facs="tcp:10505:45"/>
power or vertue ſoeuer is in the nature of Medicines and of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and doth moue and put it ſelfe in action, the ſame is to bée
reuoked to thoſe thrée beginnings.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding I deny not, but that ſome kindes of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
may ariſe from the elementary qualities, abounding in
our body, which do rather come of the excrements and feculent
humours, either retayned or ſuperabounding, and doe certainely
rather ariſe out of ſuch Elements, than out of the beginnings.
For out of the abundance of ayerie and ſpirituous windes ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
out of thinne waters, and terreſtrial feces or dregges, we do
ſée diuers kindes of effects dayly to come: yet notwithſtanding
ſuch ſickneſſes haue no long continuance, being ſuch as may bée
eaſily cured euen by Elementary remedies, being either hote
or cold, moyſt or drie. As for example, ayerie windes ſhut vp
in the bowels, and bringing forth the paines of the Collicke, are
with lyſters diſperſed and driuen away. Surperfluous humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
and thinne water is conſumned with drying medicines.</p>
               <p>Inflamations comming of a terreſtrial and ſimply groſſe
matter introſulphurus, are extinguiſhed by a ſimple cooling
helpe.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, we wil ſay with <hi>Fernelius,</hi> that ſome ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
are méerely ſecret and hidden, which the ſame <hi>Fernelius</hi>
(as doth alſo <hi>Paracelſus)</hi> affirme to be ſupernatural: which ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
come from the influences of Stars; wherin alſo is obſerued
ſomewhat which is diuine, or at leaſt more ſingular and peculiar,
than in common ſickneſſes. Such are the aſtral and aiery ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
which happen to ſome men more then to other, by a certain
ſingular influences of the Starres, or conſtitution of the heauen,
or by the concourſe of the euil Planets: who are therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly
affected, by the ſundry rootes, natures and properties of
their <hi>Aſcendentes,</hi> producing by their aſpects and radiations,
conuenient fruites in fit times.</p>
               <p>The ſecret and hidden cauſes of theſe kinde of diſeaſes, being
ſuch as we cannot eaſily reach vnto, like medicines of the ſame
nature, which are indued with a hidden vertue, are to be vſed.
And as there be Celeſtial, ſpiritual, and etherial effects: ſo alſo
<pb facs="tcp:10505:45"/>
they require ſpiritual and etherial remedies: which may elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
be taken, then from thoſe thrée beginnings brought into a
ſpirituall nature. But wée haue ſtood too long vpon this point.</p>

ſpirits, from the Sunne, from the Moone, and from Mercurie,
and are by them impregnated &amp; animated. The Arſenicals doe
receiue the ſpirits of <hi>Mars</hi> &amp; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus:</hi> euen as the Antimonials do

being impregnated by the things moſt fitting for them &amp; by
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> increaſed, doe obtaine greater forces in euery of their kindes,

               <p>For the Mercurials, as indued with more gentle and
wholeſome ſpirits, doe get a more gentle nature, medicinable
<pb facs="tcp:10505:46"/>
and nouriſhing. The Antimonials, from the intermedials, that
is to ſay, from things partly good, and partly malignant, receiue
a worſe nature, that is to ſay an intermedial. But the Arſenicals,
as ſtirred vp with the worſt and moſt pernitious ſpirits, bring a
mortall and deſtroying nature, which oftentimes bringeth great
detriment. Theſe laſt, being ſo fyerie, vehement, and violent,
doe ſerue to forme and to boyle metallick and hard ſubſtances,
and are as fyer to giue life vnto them being halfe dead, but are
in no caſe fitting to the more gentle and ſoft bodyes, ſuch as are
vegetables and Animals.</p>
               <p>Alſo the ſpirits themſelues, do put on bodies agréeing to their
natures. Arſenicals, &amp; Sulphurus, do put on the body of auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigment,
&amp; Arſenic: Antimonials, the body of Antimony and of
<hi>Magneſia,</hi> or Loade-ſtone: becauſe among other metallicks,
theſe are moſt corpulent and of groſſeſt ſubſtance, of the roote of
Saturne and Vitriole, and which for the ſame cauſe are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and beginnings of other mettals. By the impediment of
which bodies, the force and violent actiuitie of the foreſaid ſpirits,
is checked and reſtrained. Neither doe they ſhewe ſuch violent
ſtrength, when they are brought to a ſimplicitie and ſpirituous
thinneſſe. But among corporal ſpirites, the Mercurials doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede
the Antimonials in benignitie and ſwéetneſſe: and the Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicals
which are the laſt, doe ouercome the other two in violence
and malice. For theſe are wholy fierie for the moſt part, as is
already ſaid, and are therefore moſt pernicious.</p>
               <p>But the Mercurials, being of al other moſt ſimple and thinne,
are therefore more ready to worke. Alſo Mercurie it ſelfe
conſiſteth wholely of homogenial or kindly partes, and the ſame
ſpiritual: and therefore it excéedeth others in readineſſe of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
And hereupon it is made more fit than others, for an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
purger and clenſer, for that out of his whole ſubſtance
without any ſeperation of the partes, excellent and the beſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,

which it hath in it, and that you alay his too much celeritie and

promptneſſe in working. This you may doe his concoction and
fixation.</p>
               <p>Alſo the ſpirits, which by a certaine meane are fixed and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
haue place, and doe ſhew forth themſelues in Auripigment,
and in Arſenic: out of whoſe whole ſubſtance, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite

ſulphurus, fierie, violent, and deadly, that deſeruedly they

indure, but that by and by it decayeth: whoſe vehemencie,

               <p>But the Antimoniall ſpirites, as more corpulent, and groſſe
than others, doe fixe their ſeate in Antimonie, becauſe it is the
roote and original of all other mettals, which are more corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than other things.</p>
               <p>And yet for al that they doe not remaine alone, but that being
aſſociated and linked to the companie of others, as to the ſocietie
of Mercurials, and Arſenicals of the ſeuen Mettals, they bring
forth out of themſelues, thoſe ſeueral kinds. Namely, Lead, and
Tinne, when as the antimonial ſpirits doe excéed in vertue and
plentie: Iron, and Copper, when the arſenicals doe ſuperabound

more ſpiritual and ſimple than any others, and moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial:
the which being brought to perfect concoction and fixation,
doe procreate Siliuer and Golde, and doe make them pure
and cleane from all antimonial and arſenical Sulphur. For
Gold and ſiluer are nothing elſe but fixed Mercurie brought to
perfect concoction. And theſe Mettals of gold and ſiluer, when
they are wholy fixed and corporeat, hauing put off that ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

               <p>As for the other foure mettals, they hauing as yet not attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

which haue ſéene the nature of mettals in the ſearching out and

which know how to diſpearſe and ſend away ſuch mettals
into ſmoake, with their <hi>Cupels:</hi> which Philoſophers can bring
to paſſe by diuers other meanes and inſtruments.</p>
               <p>And out of theſe kindes of Metals, full of flying ſpirites, are
extracted purges of admirable operations: and the ſame accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the nature of the ſpirits abounding or predominating in
euery of them. Of the flowers or ſpirits of Tinne, and Lead,
extracted by ſublimation, are made purgations, which worke
wonderfully by dei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctions, by vomit, by ſweates, and by V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines:
which may be reckoned among the meane ſort, and ſuch
as are leſſe hurtful, albeit they be deriued from the metallicke
nature. Out of Iron and braſſe, may be extracted very good
purgatiue medicines, wel knowne to them of old time.</p>
               <p>Now to paſſe from metals to ſemi-minerals and ſo metallick
iuices, infinite purgations alſo are extracted out of them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the force of their ſpirits. As out of Vitriol, Niter, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,
Sal Armoniac, &amp; out of many other ſuch like things, may
be extracted both meane and violent Solutiues.</p>
               <p>And to make it plaine, that al the power and effect of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
which is in Mercurie, Arſenic and Antimonie, theſe thrée
metallick ſpirits, &amp; alſo what vertue partly thoſe foure imperfect
<pb facs="tcp:10505:47"/>
metals, and al kindes of Salts, Iuices, and metallicke ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
haue, doe altogether come eſpecially from theſe kinde of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
it is hereby manifeſt, that fixed Mercurie, which by no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of meanes wil moue or flye from our heart, and which is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
and communicable with our ſpirits, hath no force to purge
either by deiecting through the belly, or by prouoking to vomit:
but is rather fit to procure ſweat and vrine.</p>
               <p>But when it ſhal bée volatile and flying, by reaſon of his
wonderful ſpiritualtie and ſubtiltie, it is made a great mundifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiue
of the bodie, pearcing into all the partes and members
thereof.</p>
               <p>So in like maner the glaſſe of Antimonie, in that it hath fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and flying ſpirites, not fixed, which doth both ſhew foorth
themſelues at the time of the fuſion or melting, as alſo by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
whyte exhalation thereof, when béeing moulten it is put
vpon the Marble Stone, hath alſo a vehement force of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p>Whoſe fuſion or melting, if it be ſo long and oftentimes
reiterated, vntil no more whiteneſſe wil come from the ſame,
then it is made vtterly voyd of al working force.</p>
               <p>It wil alſo looſe all power of working or purging, if this
glaſſe be made moſt thinne in Alchool, and ſet in the heate of the
Sunne, by the heat whereof, the more thinne ſpirits doe vaniſh
away, and are conſumed. And ſo then in ſtéed of a loſing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciénce,
it is made a moſt excellent Anodine, or procurer of
ſléepe or reſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore to ſhew by inuincible Arguments, that al pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
facultie conſiſteth in thoſe flying ſpirits, and is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bée attributed vnto them, it is moſt certaine, that glaſſe may
be made of Antimonie and of Leade, and other preparation, as
well out of them, as out of metallick matters, whether it bée
by ſubliming flowers out of them, or whether it bée by
extracting of Saffron out of them, by the meanes of calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the which being beaten into fine pouder, and in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
of tenne or twelue Graines infuſed in water, or in

water eaſily powred from the reſidence or pouder which is
in the bottome, and the ſame liquor ſo giuen, there wil follow
thereof a wonderful purgation, albeit nothing of the quantitie
of the pouder bée in waight diminiſhed, becauſe the ſpirits one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(which giue no waight to the body) are left to the infuſion,
whereof commeth that great force of working.</p>
               <p>The which powder may often bée put into water or wine
to leaue therein his purging ſtrength and ſpirit: and it may ſo
bée done a hundred times, vntill the ſpirites be cleane euacuated:
and yet for all this, the pouder béeing dryed, there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
ſtill the full waight without diminiſhing. But that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
looſeth his force quite and cleane of working, if the ſpirits be

               <p>I my ſelfe haue ſéene a Ring made of the glaſſe of Leade,
which being infuſed, was to ſome a perpetuall ſolutiue Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,

               <p>Hereby it doth euidently appeare, that the force of working
lyeth hidden in certaine ſpirits, which haue the ſame propertie,
euen as in other things there is a force and power of altering
or of nouriſhing, and of paſſing into our ſubſtaunce. Hereof
a more aſſured proofe and tryal may bée made, by the induſtrie
of a learned and ſkilfull workeman, who quickly and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can take away from them al force of purging, by vſing a
certaine fyer of nature, either taking away or fixing, the
excéeding ſharpe and penetrating ſpirits of Mercurie and
Antimonie, and to make remedies of them, which can reſtore
found and perfect health, by gentle and eaſie ſweates, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
tranſpiration, to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuming of the ſuperfluous humors
<pb facs="tcp:10505:48"/>
of our bodie, as alſo to the clenſing away of all impurities ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then by any violent and manifeſt euacuation, to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the body.</p>
               <p>And as the vegetatiue being of a middle nature, betwéen the
animal and the minerall, by this nature of partaking with both,
is turned into ſenſitiue, (euen as we ſee of bread and wine, blood
to be made: of blood, ſperme or ſéede, and of ſéed a man to be
borne:) ſo the minerall (by that generall conſent of all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelues) paſſeth into vegetatiue, the vegetables ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vnto them by the rootes of the minerals, eſſentiall and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick
ſpirits with the which the whole earth is filled, as is to be
ſéene by ſo many yron mines, and by ſuch plenty of ſundry
ſtones, with the which it aboundeth and which it bringeth forth,
which are nothing elſe but of a metallick ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>And albeit ſimple vegetants, with metallick ſubſtances, doe
draw thoſe mercurialls, antimonials, and arſenicals of a purging
nature, (whereof they are called purging medicines, becauſe
they abound with a certaine ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rootes into the anatonie of vegetables:) yet are they not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo violent, and of ſo dangerous a ſpirit, as they were in their
firſt mine &amp; original, as being thin of nature wholy crude, and
indigeſted. For they put of the poyſon in the vegetable, by their
manifold concoction and digeſtion, and are made more pure, in
ſo much that they haue no other inconuenience in them, but the
force and effect of purging, except paraduenture, they be giuen
out of meaſure, &amp; in a greater quantity then is fitting. But ſome
are more purgatiue then others, namely thoſe in whom there is
greater plenty of the Mercurial ſpirits, the which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
are nothing offenſiue to our nature. Neuertheleſſe if any
vegetable haue in it an arſenicall ſpirit, albeit not altogether ſo
pernicious, as is that which is in Arſenic it ſelfe, for that it is
made more gentle by concoction, yet it is not without the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and annoya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the arſenical poyſon: ſuch are the hearbs,
Bane wort, Aconitum, and Enphorbium.</p>
               <p>If any vegetable bee endued with an Antimonial ſpirit or
<pb facs="tcp:10505:49"/>
whereſoeuer the antimonial is ioyned with another ſpirit, it
bringeth violent vomits and ſieges: ſuch are the kinds of Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bores
and Spurges, and ſuch like: neither is the vegetable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
commotion and perturbation, in regard of the violent ſpirit
which it hath in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And hereof it commeth that ſuch ſimples of vehement euacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
doe more abound in mountaines, in rockes, and in ſtony
places, where the natiue ſeate of metallick ſpirits is, then in the
fat and fertile ſoyle. For the correction whereof, and to make
them more gentle, and to put off that wild nature of theirs, they
are to be tranſplanted into home gardens. For thereby they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
another nature and more gentle nouriſhment, with the
which they are tempered, whereby they waxe ſwéete and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
whereas otherwiſe in the mountaines, they are without,
and deſtitute of that gentle nouriſhment, and ſufficient heate of
the Sunne, and of the temperature of the heauens, to concoct and
to temper their erudities. For thoſe things which are auſtere
and wild, are woont to be made gentle by digeſtions and concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
and things venemous become whole, ſo that arte imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
nature, digeſting and concocting moſt excellent remedies,
are made of deadly poyſons and ſimples. But this cannot bee
done, without the knowledge of the internal anatomie of things,
and without the aſſured ſcience of their beginnings.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. Concerning potable gold.</head>
               <p>

lead, is eaſily diſſolued into liquor,
and deſerueth then to bee called Potable
gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this muſt néedes be more conuenient
for medicine in the ſtomack of man, then
leafe gold. For how can leafe gold benefit
the ſtomack, or in any ſort be profitable for
the ſicke, when the ſecret kernell is ſo faſt incloſed in the ſhell,
<pb facs="tcp:10505:49"/>
which is ſo indigeſtible, that it will not be diſſolued in the body
of the Oſtrich. The body of any thing profiteth little or nothing
without the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, but that all actions come from the ſpirit,
for a body deuoyd of ſpirits, is empty, rotten, and dead. If the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
be they which are agents, the body is deſired in vaine.</p>
               <p>And contrariwiſe, when the body is an impediment to the
ſpirit, that it cannot vtter his force and ſtrength (as appeareth
by the working of nature it ſelfe, which without the deſtroying
and obiecting of the body, cannot change the ſpirit, that is to ſay,
the nouriſhment of meate into fleſh) then of neceſſitie, the ſpirit
muſt be deliuered from all his impediments, that it may ſhewe
it ſelfe powerfull, and not bee hindered from his working.</p>
               <p>This appeareth plaine by daily experience. For what good
doth that thing in the body, which is neither profitable for the
nouriſhment, nor yet for the health thereof?</p>
               <p>Nay, what annoyance doth it not bring to our faculties,
which lyeth in the ſtomack vndigeſted, much better then wée
ſhall prouide for our body, if in time of ſickneſſe we take that to
nouriſh and ſuſtaine vs, which is well concocted and digeſted by
art, and purged from all groſſe ſuperfluitie. For ſo nature is no
maner of way hindred from diſtributing the ſame to all the
parts, neither hath it any burden in concocting the ſame, albeit as
yet it is requiſite for nature to haue a more ſubtill worke, that it
may turne to the profit of the body. For how much more auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to helpe the ſicke which are weake of nature is the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſubſtance of a medicine, if it be giuen, tryed and ſeperated
from groſſe impurity, then to be adminiſtered with ſuch impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which oftentimes cloyeth and ouerlayeth the ſtrength of the
body. He is more blinde then any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oule which ſeeth not this.
For the ſpirit whether it be of meat or of medicine, is giuen in
ſuch ſmall quantitie, that it bringeth no detriment, but ſpéedy
profit in a moment.</p>
               <p>But yet theſe ſpirits cannot be giuen, nor prepared without
bodies, for the which cauſe we preſcribe broathes &amp; Iellies, to be
the chariots of the ſpirits: and we clenſe the bodies, that they
being made pure, the ſpirit may more firmely cleane vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:50"/>
And that they are not diſpoyled of their firſt naturall humour,
it hereby appeareth, becauſe that naturall humour is the body
of his ſpirit. But when by our art, the ſpirits are extracted, wée
muſt haue diligent care, that none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flye away into the aier
and ſo be loſt. For this cauſe we muſt looke that our veſſels be
ſure, and nothing breake out, by violence of the fier: the which
ſpirits, if we can retaine, much leſſe can their bodies eſcape.</p>
               <p>Spirits then are in bodies, and bodies paſſe into ſpirits, in
ſuch wiſe that they are corporeat ſpirits, and ſpiritual bodies, ſo
as we can giue both body and ſpirit together.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that the moſt dry calpes, doe ſtill retaine their
humour and moyſture in them, in ſo much that they may be
turned into liquor, daily experience ſhoweth. For glaſſe brought
into aſhes, and gold brought into a caix, may be reſtored to the
formes of glaſſe and gold againe, through the force of fire.</p>
               <p>But here it may be obiected (as it is by ſome) that gold hath
no force in it to prolong life, or to corroborate the ſame, becauſe
it is prolonged by onely heate remaining in moyſture and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
conſerued by the reparation of natural moyſture. But theſe
faculties or eſſences (ſay ſome) are not in gold, but rather in thoſe
things which haue liued, as in plants and liuing things, from
whom that force to prolong and preſerue life, is to be taken, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then from gold. And hereupon it is inferred, that there is
no life in metalls and minerals, but that they are plainly dead.</p>
               <p>I preſume no man will denie, that gold is the fruite of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement,
or ſome thing elementated: if a thing elementated, then
doth it conſiſt of elements: therefore alſo of forme. For elements
doe not want their beginnings, which are formall beginnings,
giuing being, or that which it is, to a thing. For ſo much as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gold is a body eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tated, it conſiſteth of matter and forme,
by the mixture whereof there ariſeth a certaine temperature, or
ſome thing of likeneſſe, which is the life of things. Therefore
gold and other metalls haue life.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, whatſoeuer the eye can ſée and behold, that
hath matter and Forme. For forme is the external, ariſing from
the internal, which offereth it ſelfe to the ſence of the eye: if it
<pb facs="tcp:10505:50"/>
haue forme and matter, then hath it alſo life. Death is ſaid ſo be
the deſtruction of things, which ſéemeth to bring the ſubiect to
nothing. But for ſo much as metalls are the obiects of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
it ſhal be thought amiſſe that they are brought to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They liue therfore becauſe they ſubſiſt. And the things which
ſubſiſt cannot be ſaid to be brought to nothing therfore not dead.</p>
               <p>By theſe reaſons it doth plainly appeare, that there is life in
metalls, becauſe they ſubſiſt, and becauſe they conſiſt of Matter
and Forme, whoſe mixture and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iunction is nothing, but by
the bond of a certaine kind of life, which is drawen from the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and beginnings, in the which conſiſteth the life of things.
Furthermore, that cannot be ſaid to be without life, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with power of acting. For actions (as we haue ſaid) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
from ſpirits. In the ſpirits is life, or elſe they themſelues
are life. And wonderful actions doe proceed and come from gold,
when it is ſpiritual and ſeperated from the waight of his body:
finally, who is he that dare denie life to be in metalls which are
indued with ſo many taſtes, with ſo many odours, with ſo many
colours, and with other vertues. Therfore gold is vitall. For ſo
<hi>Marcilius Ficinus</hi> a moſt witty Phyloſopher, and a famous
Phyſitian, writeth of gold, ſaying:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We know that all liuing things, as well plants as animals,
doe liue and are generated by a certaine ſpirit like vnto this,
and is alwaies moued, as if it were liuing, and doth moſt ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
generate among the elements, becauſe it is moſt ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
But thou wilt ſay vnto me, if the elements and liuing
things doe generate and beget, why doe not ſtones and met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls
beget, which are meane things, betwéene the elements &amp;
liuing things? I anſwere, becauſe the ſpirit which is in them is
reſtrained and hindered by a more groſſe matter, the which if
at any time it be rightly ſeperated, &amp; being ſeperated, if it be
conſerued as the ſeminary of one thing, it is able to beget vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it ſelfe the like: if ſo be, there be put to it a certaine matter
of the ſame kind: the which ſpirit diligent Phyſitians, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts
ſeperating from gold, at the fier, by a certaine ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
they wil put the ſame to any kind of metall, and make
it quick.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:51"/>
Thus it is plaine by the authority of this learned author, that
there is a vitall ſpirit in gold, and a vertue to procreate the like
to it ſelfe: as alſo it is confirmed by the teſtimony of <hi>Virgil</hi> in the
ſixt of his Aeneidos: where the Poet ſaith, that gold doth
mount and ariſe by his vertue into a trée, whoſe golden boughes
doe ſpread far and wide.</p>
               <p>If the mineral corall trée by his life natural, doe growe and
increaſe, why is it not as like that gold and other metals do grow
by the ſame life? Séeing metals doe draw their beginnings from
minerals minerals, from waters, and waters from the ſea. Now
if fiſhes ſhels, pearles, and corall, receiue life from their element,
which is the ſea, why may it not giue vital ſpirits vnto gold?
There are ſundry ſorts of life: yea, things which haue neither
motion nor ſenſe, haue life. Our daily foode, doth teach vs this,
from the vertue wherof, we drawe ſuſtenance and preſerue life,
albeit the fleſh of beaſtes and fowles whereof we féede, be firſt
depriued of life and motion. So that there is nothing vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid
of life (as we ſaid before) but that which is vtterly brought
to nothing. For out of the very rottenneſſe of wood, which doth
ſhewe and threaten the final deſtruction thereof, wormes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
ſorts, are bred and ingendered. What néede many wordes,
when as Phyloſophy teacheth vs, that out of the corruption of
one thing, commeth the generation of another. And why then
may not the generation of a vital metall be brought forth out of
the corruption of a metallick body, and which is brought into
his firſt matter: when as life in the body, is the laſt that dyeth, if
it may dye? It is plaine then, that there is life in metals.</p>
               <p>But now let vs ſee, whether this life which is in metals may
be made fit to preſerue our life, in ſuch ſort that it may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
by diſeaſes. The which I wil briefly handle and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
Thoſe things which continue longeſt in their being, haue
a more conſtant and permanent life, then haue thoſe things
which dye in a moment. This is in plants, the other in metals:
for plants and hearbes, doe wyther and vaniſh away in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but metalls wil continue a thouſand yeares and more.
Now how can hearbs promiſe long life, &amp; helpe of continuance,
which they themſelues doe want? Contrariwiſe, for ſo much as
<pb facs="tcp:10505:51"/>
metalls doe ſo long preſerue themſelues by their long life, why
ſhuld they not performe the ſame, being taken into mens bodies?</p>
               <p>The Phyloſophers ſay, that gold, of all other metalls is moſt
temperat, by the temperatures wherof, the balſam which is in vs
waxing ſicke, that is to ſay degenerating from his temperature
by the force of ſickneſſes, is reſtored &amp; holpen, in ſuch wiſe, that the
vertue of his medicine doth recall him to his temper, and doth ſo
increaſe him with ſtrength, that he eaſily ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſickneſſe.
Gold is conſecrated to the Sunne for his colour and brightneſſe,
and to <hi>Iupiter</hi> for his temperature, &amp; therefore it can wonderfully
temper the natural heate with moyſture, preſerue the humours
from corruption, and bring the Solary and Iouial vertue to the
ſpirits and members.</p>
               <p>The beſt way to make potable gold, is without mixture of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other thing. The next vnto potable gold, is that which is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
into thin leaues, which for want of the other, may be vſed in
medicine cordial, to comfort the heart. The tincture of gold being
extracted, doth clenſe and reſtore the blood. So that hereby the
homogenial and kindly parts are gathered together, and the
Heterogenial or vnkindly are ſeperated. For ther is nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heauen to be found more homogenial, or ſimular, of more
thinne ſubſtance, of more temperate nature, &amp; leſſe ſubiect to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
or putrifaction, then the very pure ſubſtance of metalls,
or quick-ſiluer. What therefore can be more fit for our Balſam
then that ſpirituall medicine, purged from all impuritie, and
brought to exquiſite ſubtiltie. Doth not a ſpirituall nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
and imbrace a ſpirituall nature? Why is not gold impay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the fier, but doth rather ioy therein, and is made more
pure? Is it not becauſe it is fier? For fier is not thruſt out
with fier, but they imbrace one the other as being of one kind.
So in like manner, for ſo much as our Balſam of life is moſt
pure, and reſembleth the nature of fier, why ſhould it not receiue
his like, and be ſtrengthened thereby? For <hi>Geber</hi> ſaith, that
gold is a medicine, which maketh the heart merry, &amp; preſerut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the body in youth: the which medicine is no other thing, but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
heat, multiplyed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fixed ſubſtance of Mercury: the vertue
of which heat is to gather together (as it is ſaid afore) y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kindly, &amp; to
<pb facs="tcp:10505:52"/>
diſceuer and put away all things that are vnkindly, conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the ſpirits and humours in a man ſooner then in the nature
of metalls, becauſe a man by his proper natural heat doth ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the vnkindly ſuperfluities, which metalls by their vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
heat cannot ſeperate.</p>
               <p>But let the reader vnderſtand, that our meaning is not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
this Aurum potabile, for continual foode, but for medicine
onely in time of néede. For it will ſuffice, if it be taken once or
twiſe in the yeare, to prolong our dayes to Neſtorian yeares,
without the yrkeſomneſſe of ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Phyloſophers haue not onely called this medicine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
potabile, but alſo the water of life, the Tincture, the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtone, the medicine which worketh wonderfully vpon thrée
ſorts of things, namely vpon the animal, vegetable, and mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
for the which cauſe it is called the Animal, Vegetable, and
Mineral Stone: and the Arabian Aſtrologians call it the great
Elixir.</p>
               <p>Wonderful is the vertue of this medicine: for herewith the
body of man being ſick, is reſtored to health, imperfect metals
are turned into gold or ſiluer, and vegetables, albeit they are
dry and withered, being moyſtened with this liquor, doe waxe
freſh and greene againe. This Medicine being a quinteſſence is
almoſt incorruptible and immortal, temperate, purified by the
elements themſelues, and ſeperated from the dregs and groſſe
matter of the fower elements, which are the moſt chiefe cauſe of
corruption, as the Phyloſophers affirme: which therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a temperate and ſound body, becauſe it is, as it were the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of life, by whoſe force and helpe, nature doth digeſt all that is
indigeſted, or expulſe the ſuperfluous and offending humours: it
ſuppreſſeth their qualities, it quickeneth the ſpirit, it maketh the
ſoft hard, and the hard ſoft: the thick, thinne, and the thinne thick:
the leane fat, and the fat leane: it maketh the cold, hote, and the
hote cold: it moyſteneth the dry, and drieth the moyſt: to conclude,
it confirmeth and ſtrengtheneth the natural heate &amp; moyſture.
And as all Phyloſopers doe write with one conſent, it is an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal
medicinable body, whereunto all the particularities of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
are reduced and infuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:52"/>
For this cauſe, it is as it were a fineth nature, or eſſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a
moſt thinne ſoule, moſt purgatiue, much reſiſting for a very long
time, putrifaction or corruption, freed from al mortal concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a celeſtial and ſimple ſubſtance of the Elements, brought to
to this ſpiritual nature, by <hi>Chymical ſublimation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet for al this, we affirme not that this medicine is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
incorruptible, for as much as it is made and conſiſteth
of natural things. Neuertheleſſe, it is brought to that ſubtiltie,
thinneſſe and ſimplicitie ſpiritual, that it ſéemeth to containe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it that is Heterogenial, or vnkindely, whereby it may
be corrupted: whereby alſo it commeth to paſſe, that being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the ſicke, it preſerueth them a long time in health.</p>
               <p>And for this cauſe the Philoſophers haue had this in ſo great
eſtéeme, and haue wholy addicted themſelues to ſeeke and ſearch
out the ſame, not to make themſelues rich, by turning imperfect
metals into gold and ſiluer, when as many of them willingly
embraced pouertie, but rather to heale the diſeaſes and ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

all freckles and ſpots, clearing the ſkinne, and making if fairer.
It cleanſeth the body from Itch and Scabbes, and dryeth vp the

are to be cured.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is alleaged out of the authoritie of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
and <hi>Galen,</hi> that contraries are
cured by contraries. But hée which affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that contraries are cured by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries,
hée ſhall neuer eaſily finde out a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
for ſickneſſe: neither was this <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
meaning, as ſhall bée ſhewed
anon. It is out of queſtion that ſickneſſes
doe ariſe from the diſagrement of the beginnings: and ſo often
as thoſe beginnings doe decline from their temper, (which is
then called a diſtemperature) and the one being ſeperated from
the conſort of the other, taking vp his ſtanding by himſelfe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth
ſickneſſe. For when it is not in mixture with the other,
(which being ioyned together, do maintaine concord) they then
make warre vpon the body, without any ſtoppe or let. I ſpeake
not here of ſimple and bare qualities, but of the very eſſences
wherein are thoſe powers and faculties whereof <hi>Hypocrates</hi>
ſpeaketh, which preſerue the health of their <hi>Balſam,</hi> or to reſtore
it when it is loſt.</p>
               <p>Seing therefore the ſéedes and properties both of health and
of ſickneſſes, lye hid in the eſſences, it followeth that they are to be
cheriſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eſſences, and not with qualities. The which eſſences
forſomuch as they are méere acting ſpirits, they are to be repelled
<pb facs="tcp:10505:54"/>
with ſpirits, not with bodyes, which are not like them, or which
are contrary to them.</p>
               <p>But it is obiected, that al things conſiſt of Elements, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our bodies alſo. If then the Element of ayer do ſuffer and
be out of courſe in vs, ſhal the ſame be holpen with the Element
of earth? Why then haue Phiſitians ſo fewe remedies againſt
the peſtilence? Is it becauſe there are none at al? (I confeſſe
when God wil puniſh hée taketh away the vertue from reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and medicines.) That is not the cauſe, I meane the want
of remedies, but becauſe ignorant Phiſitians, know not the
cauſes of the peſtilence, and therefore d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e not rightly prouide
to preuent the ſame. For ſéeing they oppoſe againſt the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
comming of the corruption of the Ayer, a medicine taken
from earth, water or ayer, or from the earth hauing a watery
original, what maruayle is it, if there follow no effect thereof,
when as they doe not driue away thoſe things which are to bée
mixed together, but thoſe things which doe eaſily agrée and are
gathered together. For how can the heauen and the earth bée
mingled together, to helpe the diſtemperature of the Heauen,
betwéene the which there is ſo great diſtance, as there is betwéen
diuiſible and indiuiſible, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſpake. Therefore celeſtiall
things are to be mingled with celeſtial things, waterie with
waterie and earthie with earthie, and not contrariwiſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
there can be no agréement.</p>
               <p>Conſider wel, that Heauen, Aier, Water, and Earth, are in
vs, but yet a certaine thing alſo farre more excellent, namely, a
certaine ſupernatual body, which conſerueth all other things in
their temperature, whoſe ſtrength retaineth all other things in
their office: whereas imbecilitie and defect ſuffereth them to be
out of courſe. What then is to bée done in this conflict but to
cheriſh and vphold in his vigor and ſtrength, that ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
bodie, that is to ſay, the <hi>Balſam</hi> of nature, that al other things

of thoſe things which are deſired, &amp; an ablation of thoſe
things which doe too much abound, according to the ſound opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Galen</hi> here.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Hypocrates</hi> aymeth at a further matter, in that he would
haue the diſeaſe qualified &amp; driuen away, by giuing ſtrength to
nature againſt the enemy: which nature being the onely Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
and curer of diſeaſes, is to be holpen with ſuch things as
are like to the diſeaſes, that ſo ſickneſſes and the paſſions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may be mittigated: euen as hunger and thyrſt, are recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
&amp; aſſwaged by thoſe remedies, which they gréedily deſire.
But hoſtile things, that are enemy &amp; contrary, are not deſired,
but ſuch things as are a friend and familiar. For who wil giue
to his hungery ſon when he aſketh bread, a <hi>Scorpion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Therefore
like and fitting liquors, and nouriſhments are to be giuen, which
may procure to nature deſired reſt. For remedies which come
out of the ſame fountaine, and out of the ſame familie, which are
agréeing and fitting in likeneſſe are to be miniſtred. For the
thyrſting ſpirits of feuers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are to be recreated with ſyrups, with
ſugars, with pertiſan alone, or with wine, becauſe they are not
of the ſame family and affinitie with them, therefore neither fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
friends nor kinſmen: but with thoſe tart liquors, which
are begotten of the ſame linage, which are ſpiritual not corporal,
as are thoſe former, of the which, it certaine drops be offered to
him which is a thirſt, they wil by and by ſlake his thirſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
bring ſuch thirſty ſpirits to their reſt. After the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
watchings, paines, burning heares, and ſuch like are cured.
For when the ſpirits are thirſty, that is to ſay, when they deſire
any thing like to themſelues which is wanting, they wil neuer
be appeaſed nor at reſt, vntill they haue obtained that which they
deſire, and haue ſupplyed their want. Wherefore they are right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called, by <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> contraries: and by <hi>Hermeticall</hi> Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
remedies of like ſort. For they are Similies, which are
drawen from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ame anatomie of nature, contayning like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
tinctures, and rootes. And on the other ſide, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries,
becauſe they ſupply the defects, and doe ſatiſfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
with friendly fulneſſe, appeaſing the ſpirits, and their fitting
<pb facs="tcp:10505:56"/>
impurities, ſéeking to conſume them, or to take them away.
Therefore theſe phraſes of ſpéech in natures anatomie, albeit
they ſéeme different, and repugnant one to the other, yet in good
conſent and agréement they are receiued and admitted. That is
to ſay, that contraries haue contrary remedies, &amp; like to their like.</p>
               <p>But to returne to our beginning, that is to ſay to the elements,
or to thoſe thrée hypoſtatical &amp; formal principles of bodies, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Salt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sulphur, and Mercurie, which is a liquor: for ſo much as
vpon them all grieuous diſeaſes for the moſt part doe depend, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
much that a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peſtilence flying in the outward aire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
inuade a man, but it muſt make a breach and aſſaile one of
theſe. Therefore thou ſhalt not doe more fooliſhly, if to helpe him
which is grieued with a mercurial ſickneſſe, thou vſe a remedie
taken out of Sulphur, then if thou ſhouldeſt mingle oyle with
water, which two wil neuer be mixed or vnited. And in like ſort,
thou ſhalt labour in vaine, if thou goe about to helpe Sulphurus
ſickneſſes with a Mercurial medicine: or to put away ſalt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
with the help of others. For theſe wil neuer agrée toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and being ſo vnlike one to the other, they wil neuer be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in one, to heale and cure the bodie, except they be knit in a
friendly peace and vnion, by that ſupernatural &amp; ethereal body,
that is to ſay, by the <hi>Balſam</hi> which is common to al things. Hée
therefore which is ſick of Mercurie, muſt be holpen with mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
remedies: as the <hi>Epilepſie,</hi> and the <hi>Apolexi,</hi> are to be holpen
with vitriolated remedies taken from water. And hée which
wil help ſulphurus ſickneſſe, muſt vſe ſulphurus remedies, and
ſickneſſes proceeding of Salt, with medecines taken from Salt.
So thou ſhalt be taught by reaſon and experience, that things of
like ſort wil agrée &amp; be cured with their like. We might yet make
theſe things more plaine, &amp; lay the ſame more open by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

               <p>I meane to ſpeake of Niter, which men commonly cal Salt-Peeter.
I let paſſe the deteſtable and pernicious vſe thereof,
inuented for the deſtruction of men: And yet I muſt confeſſe
that it deſerueth great admiration, in that it ſheweth forth ſo
great, and incredible effects, when as we being in theſe lower

of what quality, in his owne nature and compoſition, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

kind of groundes which haue bene repleniſhed with ſalt liquor,
or with the vrine of beaſtes, rather then out of a leane hungry
land, waſhed with raine, or by ſome ſuch like occaſion, depriued
of that radical humour. It is moſt plentifully extracted from the
ground where doue-houſes are ſeated, and out of Pigeons dung:
and this is the beſt Niter of all others: the which is worthy the
noting. Whereby it appeareth, that Niter doth participate with
the excrements and vrines of liuing creatures.</p>
               <p>For vrines are nothing elſe, but a ſuperfluous ſeperation
of the Salt of vegetables, by which, liuing creatures are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
and doe liue. Whereby it euidently appeare, how the
foreſaid Salt doth in kind participate with the nature animal,
and vegetable. For as touching that which pertaineth to the

ſauing that wée thinke good to adde thus much, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of the earth, which is the reaſon why it is called Salt-Péeter,
when as more properly it ſhould be called the ſalt of the
earth. But let vs goe forward.</p>
               <p>Nature miniſtereth matter to Art, whereof Salt-Péeter
is compounded: Art cannot make by it ſelfe, no more then
nature can make Salt-Péeter-pure, and ſeperated from all ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrilie
and heterogeneal or vnkindly ſubſtance. For that it
may produce the ſame effects which the other produceth, it muſt
be prepared by the induſtry of workemen. For theſe make
choyſe of conuenient earth, and out of fit places, to them well
knowne, and being filtered, or ſtrained with hote common
water, againe and againe, through the ſame earth, as lyes
are vſually made with aſhes, it commeth to paſſe that a ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or briniſh taſte is mingled therewith, which is proper to all
ſalts.</p>
               <p>Of the which like, or water ſo diſtreined, if two thirds or ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboutes
be vapored away by ſéething at the fire, and then let
coole, the ſalt will be thickened into an Ice, whereof the maker of
Salt-Péeter finiſheth his worke, purifying the ſame by ſundry
diſſolutions, and coagulations, that it may looſe his fatneſſe quite

This common worke, being triuial, and no better then me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical,

               <p>Wherefore in that moſt common eſſence of earth, theſe thrée

And we determine to place our thrée hypoſtatical and

neither is it ſet on fire, and therefore is wholy different from that
which is congealed in the ſame water, which is called Salt-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The which thing truly deſerueth to bée diligently conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
not of ordinary Salt-peter-men, which are ignorant of the
nature of things, but of Phyloſophers, if they deſire to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and to be ſuch. To whom it ſhal manifeſtly appeare, that
Salt which by nature and qualitie (according to the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Phyloſophers) is hote and dry, a ſulphurus Salt, fierie,
and apt to be ſet on fire, ſuch as is Salt peter, wil be coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or congealed in water, wherein al other ſaltes are diſſolued,
no leſſe than that ſalt which procéeded from the very ſame eſſence
of Salt-peter, may be diſſolued in water, as we haue ſaid.</p>
               <p>Therefore not without great cauſe, the admirable nature of
Salt-peter deſerueth to be conſidered, which comprehendeth in
it two volatile partes: the one of Sulphur, the other of Mercurie.
The Sulphurus part is the ſoule thereof,<note place="margin">Two flying parts of ſalt-peter.</note> the Mercurial is his
ſpirit.</p>
               <p>The Sulphurus part commeth to that firſt moouing of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is nothing elſe, but an ethereal fire, which is neither
<pb facs="tcp:10505:62"/>
hote nor drie, not conſuming like the Elementarie fyre, but

bée Animal or Vegetable, death by and by enſueth. The
which commeth ſo to paſſe vppon no other cauſe, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the defect of this vital heate, which is the repayrer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer

               <p>The ſame vital heate, is alſo to bée found, albeit more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely

by the ſympathy and concordance, which the ſayd ſalt-peter hath
with Mettals: as is to be ſéene in the diſſolutions, whereof wée

               <p>Beſide that ſulphurus part, there is alſo found in ſalt-peter,
a certaine Mercurial of ayerie nature, and which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

This ſpirit is not hote in qualitie, but rather colde, as
appeareth by the tart and ſharpe taſte thereof: the which
ſharpneſſe and coldneſſe is wonderful, and is farre different
from the Elementary coldneſſe: for that it can diſſolue bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

               <p>This ſame ſower and tart ſpirit, is alſo found in ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs,
of the ſame qualitie, not burning, nor ſetting on fire,
and which congealeth ſulpur, and maketh it firme, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

               <p>Furthermore, this ſharpe, ſower, and cold ſpirit, is the cauſe
why Salt-Péeter hauing his ſulphur ſet on fire, giueth a cracke:
that ſo ſalt-péeter may be of the number of them, whereof <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>

Which words of his are diligently to be conſidered. But what

               <p>And the ſpirit is as it were the mediator, and conſeruer of
the ſoule with the body, becauſe through the benefite thereof, it
is ioyned and coupled with the ſoule. And the ſoule, quickeneth
the ſpirit, and the body.</p>
               <p>Yée haue alſo ſeene in the aforeſaide ſalt, a <hi>Hermaphroditicall</hi>

               <p>The properties thereof are no leſſe wonderful: nay, rather
<pb facs="tcp:10505:63"/>
much more wonderful. For Salt-peter is the eſpecial key and
cheife Porter, which openeth moſt hard bodies, and the moſt
ſolid things, as wel ſtones as Metal: and bringeth gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
into liquor, which the proper water extracted out of the

it maketh al bodyes metallick, ſpiritual and volatile: ſo on the

how flying ſoeuer they bée.</p>
               <p>Who now wil not wonder, or rather bée amazed, which
knoweth that Salt-peter is ſo apt &amp; ready to take fire, by which
it paſſeth into ayre and ſmoake, and yet in the meane time ſeeth
that it remaineth liquid and fuſible in a red hote crucible, placed
in the center of burning coales? notwithſtanding the which moſt
burning heate, it conceiueth no flame, except the flame or fyre
happen to touch it. And which is more, being of nature ſo vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til,

<pb facs="tcp:10505:64"/>
and moderate the ſame by degrées according to Art: ſhe which

thou ſhalt continue by the ſpace of fiue or ſixe houres: and
then thou ſhalt finde and plainly ſée, that the ſpirits of Salt-peter,
haue penetrated the very glaſſe of the Alembic, and that it hath
diſſoloued the ſame as wel within as without.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the ſpirits of the Salt-peter, which are come
through the body of glaſſe, cleauing to the out-ſide therof like vnto

               <p>That which remaineth in the bottom of the Culcurbit, ſo white

to clenſe, and to purge, and euacuate the corruptions of humors,
and to conſerue the body from al pollution of corruption. For
ſéeing it is of the nature of Balſamic Salt, it muſt néedes bée in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with ſuch vertues and properties. And in very déede to
deale plainly and truely, I cannot if I would, ſufficiently extol
with prayſes, the true Salt-peter, and Fuſile ſalt of the Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.
This Salt, <hi>Homer</hi> cals diuine. And <hi>Plato</hi> writeth,
that this Salt, is a friend and familiar to diuine things. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Phyloſophers haue ſaid, that it is the ſoule of the vniuerſal,
the quickening ſpirit, and that which generateth al things.</p>
               <p>It may peraduenture ſéeme that we haue bene too tedious in
the inquiſition and ſpeculation, as wel of the general, as of the
particular, concerning the nature of Salt: but it is ſo profitable
and neceſſarie, that it is the Baſis, and foundation of al medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
faculties (as more at large ſhalbe ſhewed in his place) that
Phyſitians may haue wherewith to buſie themſelues, and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
               <p>But as touching a Chymical Philoſopher, let him know
<pb facs="tcp:10505:64"/>
that hée ought to beſtowe his labour moſt chiefely in fuſil Salts,
and to remember that Philoſophers haue not without good cauſe
euer and anon cryed; Bake it, Bake it, and bake it againe:
which is al one, as if they had ſayd, Calcine, calcine, or bring it
to aſhes.</p>
               <p>And in very déede if wée wil confeſſe the trueth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
al Chymical workings, as Diſtillations, Calcinations,
Reuerberations, Diſſolutions, Filtrations, Coagulations,
Decoctions, Fixations, and ſuch other appertaining to this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
tend to no other ende, then ſo to bring their bodies into
duſt or aſhes, that they may communicate the ſpirits of Saltes
and ſulphur which haue made them (placed neuertheleſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one and the ſame eſſence) after a certaine imperceptible
manner, with their metallick water, and true Mercurie: and
that to this ende, that by the infernal vertue and force of Salt,
the Mercurie may bée conſumed, boyled, and altered from
his vile nature, into a more noble: when as of common Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie,
it is made by the benefite of the ſpirit of Salt, the
Mercurie of the Phyloſophers: which Salt it hath attracted
out of the aſhes, or calx vine Metallick.</p>
               <p>Euen like as it commeth to paſſe in the lye-waſh which
is made of aſhes and water, the which béeing oftentimes
meſſhed and drawen away, the aſhes leaue al their life and
ſtrength, communicating all their Salt to the foreſayd wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
the which water, albeit, it alwayes remaineth fluxile and
liquid, yet it abydeth not ſimple and pure water, colde, or of
ſmal vertue: but béeing now made lye, it is become hote,
and of a drying qualitie, clenſing, and of qualitie wholely
actiue, which is altogether the vertue and facultie of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
medicine.</p>
               <p>But it is to bée conſidered, of what matter this quicke and
metallick aſhes are to bée made. Alſo of what manner of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the lye is to bée prepared, that thou mayeſt exalt the Salt or
Sulphur of the Phyloſophers, that is to ſay, the Balſamick me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
which is ful of actiue qualities like vnto thunder, béeing
reduced into a true liuing calx.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:65"/>
And whereas at the firſt, it was a certaine dead body voyde
of life, it ſhal then be made a liuing body indued with ſpirit, and

they ſought &amp; indeuored to diſſolue and breake his hard bonds,

that the vegetable ſpirits of gold, (which now lay hidden as it

that they might compound a certaine Balſamic Medicine, to

that Nectar of our life, in good and laudable temperament. But
indéed it is not to be wondered at, that gold being deliuered from

and renue the Balſam of our nature, and doth conſerue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>And ſo much leſſe it is to be maruailed at, that forſomuch as

the rule of phleame, the burning of choller, and the aduſtion of

ſuch like haue, which are natural and naturally hote: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
we wil ſhew plainly, that ſuch waters artificial, by induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
may be made at any time, and in any place, and with no
leſſe commodity and profit.</p>
               <p>There are a ſort of men, which in ſome meaſure are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
which being old, and thinke that they know all things, are
aſhamed to begin now to learne againe: but they which oppoſe
themſelues obſtinately, and through enuy and malice, doe carpe
and cauil, are more out of courſe, againſt whom we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſay in our defence but this, that they bewray their groſſe
ignorance and malice.</p>
               <p>But the order and maner of preparing the Medicine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we treat here, was in old time called mineral, in regard that
the Phyloſophical Sulphur or Salt, which ſerueth for animation
or vegetation, is extracted out of the firſt vegetatiue ſpring of
mineral nature.</p>
               <p>Many Phyloſophers haue taken Saturn or Lead for the
mineral ſubiect. Other ſome haue taken the Saturnal Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia
or Loadſtone, which is the firſt metallick roote, and of the
ſtocke and kind of vitriol. <hi>Iſaac Holland, Ripley,</hi> and many other
Phyloſophers, haue written their workes concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the which, forſomuch as they are extant, euery one that liſt
may read them. For we haue no other purpoſe in this place,
but to teach and demonſtrate in plaine maner, what that Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam
radical is, and that vniuerſal medicine, ſo much ſpoken of by
auncient phyloſophers, for the conſeruation of health, and for
the curing of diſeaſes in mans body.</p>
               <p>Others (among whom alſo is <hi>Raymund Lully)</hi> ſought their
fire of nature in a vegetable, to animate gold. For this
was that which al men eſpecially laboured for, to put life into
gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:67"/>
And this is the reaſon why they all ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there is onely
one way, and one matter, or Balſamick Sulphur and of
nature, which yéeldeth actiue and internal fire, to the ſame work.</p>
               <p>And among all vegetables, the chiefeſt is wine. For of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it partaketh very much of the vitriolated nature: which may
be gathered, not ſo much by that gréene collor of the vnripe cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of grapes and their ſharpe faſt: as by the ſaphiric and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
colour of thoſe that are ripe, which appeareth both within
and alſo without, and by the ſharpe taſt: all which things doe
plainly declare both the external and internal qualities of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</p>
               <p>It is alſo wel knowne that there are certaine ſuch waters in
<hi>Auuergne</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which haue the taſte of wine with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
pricking facultie or reliſh.</p>
               <p>Vineger alſo, whereto wines is eaſily brought, when his ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurus
life is gone, (that is to ſay, when his ſpirit is ſeperated)
doth repreſent the tart qualitie of Vitriol, as doth alſo other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of wine ſufficiently known to true Phyloſophers.<note place="margin">The Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal miniſtries</note> The
which alſo may be gathered by the concordance and agréement
which wine hath with the metallick nature, ſéeing that as well
out of wine as out of Vitriol, the Menſtrue of <hi>Chymical</hi> Art may
be prepared, which is able to diſſolue metals into liquor.</p>
               <p>Theſe are (I ſay) the reaſons why <hi>Raymund Lully,</hi> and other
famous Phyloſophers, placed their workings in wine, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
of their Balſamick Sulphur, that thereby they might
make true potable gold, and the infallible Balſamick medicine.</p>

               <p>And this is the true Medicine, this is the reaſon of his vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie,
this is his puritie and perfection.</p>
               <p>Neither is there any thing more eaſie then the preparation

               <p>But if there bée any man, which wil not take vpon him
this labour, albeit moſt profitable, and ordained for health and
the prolonging of mans life, and for the ſame hée may exactly
prepare theſe Balſamick medicines: yet at the leaſt hée wil by
the meanes thereof, as it were by a certaine Director,
ſeeke out in general, the euacuating, mundifying, and
clenſing faculties, which are in moſt vſe, and which chiefly
conſiſt in Salts: and in like manner the aſſwagers, mittiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
ayd healers, in Sulphur and Oile: and finally the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhers,
reſtorers, and comforters in the liquor or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie.</p>
               <p>And by the ſame way and reaſon it ſhal bée taught, that
the true correctors of all remedies, are purifying and cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>Furthermore, let vs ſée how much the ſaid Medicine perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in the driuing away diſeaſes, and what infinite multitude
of remedies it hath. And firſt, forſomuch as it may be applyed
and fitted to al intentions requiſitie (as may be gathered by that
which hath béene ſaid afore) and forſomuch as it may bée giuen
in ſo ſmall a doſe, which wil bring no violent action, nor loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe

worketh excéeding wel, according to the diſpoſition
of our nature, I ſée no reaſon why this vniuerſal and moſt
noble Medicine, ſhould not be preferred before theſe rapſodies of
Medicines.</p>
               <p>Who ſo vſeth rightly this Medicine, and in fit time, ſhal
bée refreſhed and corroborate, and ſo armed with ſtrength,
that from thenceforth hée ſhal more eaſily and readily ſhake
<pb facs="tcp:10505:73"/>
off his ſickneſſe: whereof nature otherwiſe being deſtitute,
would eaſily be ouercome. Let vs vſe a familiar example that
thoſe things which we haue hitherto ſpoken, may more plainly
appeare to all men.</p>
               <p>We ſée in our elemental fire, that if thou caſt into the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that wil eaſily take flame, as ſtrawe, or any ſuch thing
which wil readily burne and increaſe the force of burning, which
before was almoſt extinguiſhed, for becauſe it was deſtitute as it
were of nouriſhment, and wholy as it were ouerwhelmed of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes:
So alſo our radicall Balſam the fire brand, and burning
lampe of the fire of our nature, wanting conuenient and proper
nouriſhment whereby it fainteth, or elſe ſo ouerwhelmed by the
feces and aſhes of obſtructions, that it is in danger of ſuffocation
and ſmoothering, or elſe kindred by ſome other cauſe, whereby it
cannot exerciſe liuing flame for the conſeruation of our life: then
indéed it ſtandeth in néede of a calefactor, and reſtorer of heate,
that in better maner and more readily it may ſhew forth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

alſo is to be had concerning our natural Balſam, the which
being diminiſhed, or being hindred or hurt by any occurrent
outwardly, being againe increaſed by that Balſamick medicine,
it ariſeth eſt ſoone, and moſt perfectly performeth his woonted
functions. For ſéeing that medicinall Balſam is of a certaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal
nature or a heauenly fire, becauſe it quickeneth and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not, nor conſumeth: therefore out of hand, as if it were a
permanent and certaine ſpiritual water of life, it doth comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and is as it were vnited with our ſpirit, and doth repaire
and increaſe it, by reaſon of the ſimpathy, and common likeneſſe
therewith. Neither is it to be thought, that this commeth ſo to
paſſe, for any other cauſe, but only of this (as was ſaid euen now)
namely of that friendly conuenience, and agréeing friendſhip,
which that Balſamick medicine, hath with our radical Balſam.
The which is the onely reaſon why I call the one, Balſam of
life, and the other the medicinal Balſam, euen for the relatiue
conuenience of them both. And yet beſide this ſimilitude and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
of nature, it hath other particular vertues. For it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:10505:74"/>
with great actiuitie, it is ſpiritual and excéeding pearcing:
for this cauſe it doth attenuate and make thinne, it doth digeſt,
diſſolue, and euacuate theſe ſeculent ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uffings and aſhes, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
peril of ſuffocation and choaking to the Balſam of life.
Moreouer, if there be any impurity or corruption, by which it is
much offended, by what other meanes can it bee more ſafely
and better rooted out, then by a thing ſo pure and incorruptible?
And if any burning feauer doe inuade the body and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
parts of life about the heart, with what more conuenient
ſharpe Syrup, or Syrup of Limons, canſt thou extinguiſh it,
then by the Balſamick ſharpneſſe of this our medicine? Let
gun-poulder ſpeake for vs: and by a ſufficient teſtimony of this
thing, which this liquor doth not onely extinguiſh, but alſo will
not ſuffer it to take flame, but maketh it idle. Witneſſes alſo are

                     </gap> Mariae:</hi> &amp; yet with all, the ſame liquor hath
this property, that it wil attemperate and diſſolue the moſt hard
Iſe. Is there any paine and griefe that would be aſſwaged?
This medicine ſhal be thy mittigating anodine, and moſt health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

then this, which is the ſumme of all Alexipharmacons, &amp;
the moſt chiefe preſeruatiue from all infection. Is the heart to be
corroborated, &amp; the ſpirits to be vegetated? No confection Alker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
no confection of Hyacinth, is to be preferred before this bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam.
To conclude, what more ſpéedy altering medicine can there
be found, which is able to correct a diſtemperature, then that moſt
temperat remedy? To theſe vnſpeakeable vertues, adde yet this
one, that this medicine, neuer bringeth with it a glutting loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe,
or perturbation of the body: but quickly, ſafely, &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
performeth his workings. And the ſame with ſo ſmall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe,
that whereas in other medicine, ounces, are required, in this
a few graines diſſolued in wine or in broath, or in other conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

produce great and wonderful effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:74"/>
Theſe are thoſe great properties of this vniuerſal medicine ſo
much ſpoken of by the ancient Phyloſophers. Theſe are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
vertues of our ſaid medicinable Balſam, the coadintor,
&amp; priuie director of our natural Balſam, which is the only meane
to conſerue our life: which natural Balſam, is the onely immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
putter away of ſickneſſes, and of all corporal infirmities. For
if ſickneſſes (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith) be an effect againſt nature, hurting
actions, then muſt it alſo needes be contrary to our radical Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam
&amp; Nectar of our life, which is nothing elſe but the ſame nature
or elſe an inſtrument ſo reſiſting it, &amp; conioyned with it, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the helpe hereof, it can intend to doe or performe nothing.</p>
               <p>Therefore now whether the functions be diminiſhed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued,
or altogether aboliſhed, it cannot otherwiſe be, but that
our ſaid radical Balſam, is in ſome part hurt, ſeeing it is certaine
that all thoſe laudable functions procéed there from. This is that
which <hi>Hypocrates</hi> calleth mans nature. This is that diſpoſer,
which maketh the attractions, expulſions, mixtions, ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and concoctions of meates and drinkes. To this
chiefely, the ſame <hi>Hypocrates</hi> attributeth al the foreſaid functions
of our body. Not that the ſame Balſam of our radical, can take
vpon it ſelfe and on his ſubſtance, alterations, and that it can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
ſéeing it is of an ethereal and celeſtial nature, &amp; therefore after
a certaine maner incorruptible: but becauſe his action is delayed,
or hindered by lets, which lye hidden in the internal members
and bowels, and which doe occupy and trouble the ſame.</p>
               <p>This is the occaſion, this is the beginning, and principall
foundation of diſeaſes.<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> Therfore to take vpon me the diſpute, and
to defend it, thus I determine.</p>
               <p>If ſuch a diſeaſe comming vpon a man, be to be taken cleane

it wil come to paſſe, that the ſicke man, within the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of one hower, ſhal haue and féele more ſolace, and ſo much the
more, when the ſame Balſam of life, being holpen with that
Balſamick medicine, doth more boldly expulſe the enemy: and
that in a very ſhort time, I ſay to the greater ioy and comfort of
the ſicke, then can the huge multitude of common potions,
powred into the loathing of the patient, bring to paſſe, and that
very hardly in a long time.</p>
               <p>And leaſt any man might thinke, that theſe are our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions,<note place="margin">Galen. Lib. 13. Method.</note>
raſhly and inconſideratly broached by vs, let vs heare
what <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith. <q>The principal intention (ſaith he) of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ought to be to reduce the ſicke to his natural eſtate, and
that neglecting all other things, his onely care muſt be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
that, from whence the faculty of acting cometh. And this
conſiſteth in that natural heate, the which ſo long as it is of
force and not hindred, it preſerueth the body in ſafety, in ſuch
wiſe, that whatſoeuer happeneth to the body vnnaturally, and
muſt be taken away, it is an vndoubted axiome, that it ſtandeth
in néede of a ſtrong natural heate. And albeit in external ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and in certaine others, it may ſéeme that natural heate is
little auaileable, as in the remouing of fleſh which groweth too
ranke in a wound, or for the reuniting of the lippes of a wound,
yet for all that, the coniunction and generation of fleſh, and the
healing thereof, cannot be done without natural heate.</q> This
foreſpeaketh <hi>Galen,</hi> and very truly. Yea, all his followers wil
willingly confeſſe, that it is onely nature, and that quickening
radical Balſam, which ſheweth forth all thoſe wholſome functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
the which nature both here and before by the authoritie of
<hi>Galen,</hi> we haue rightly called the true healer of all ſickneſſes: but
ſo farre forth nature is holpen, ſtirred vp, and corroborated by all
maner helpe and arte of that Balſamick medicine, that it can
expel, ouercome, and caſt out all whatſoeuer is grieuous or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
vnto it. Thus farre forth they and we agrée together.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, this alſo is to be granted, that the ſame nature
is the beginning, and as it were the firſt mouing to all curing:
becauſe without the ſtrength and vigor of nature, all medicine
<pb facs="tcp:10505:75"/>
is vnprofitable and vaine. For nature is alwaies one and like to
her ſelfe, neither is ſhe at any time idle in vs, but is perpetually
occupied, alway ſtirring mouing, and vegetating, vntill by too

about to put away and ouercome: But when ſhe hath to
doe with a moſt ſtrong enemie, or with many, ſhe ſooner and far
more eaſily can ouercome them, if ſhe be ſtrengthened with the
helpes of arte, and hauing conuenient meanes, ſhe ſhall with
greater ſtrength and ſecurity preuaile.</p>
               <p>To bring which thing to paſſe, our Balſamick medicine by
that exquiſite preparation, hath gotten a moſt pure, quickening,
ſpiritual, ſtrengthening, and kindly nature, which without all
exception, is farre more conuenient and effectual, then other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
of common Phyſitians, prepared by no arte, by no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
or dexterity.</p>
               <p>The which, forſomuch as they are yet crude, impure, and
groſſe, and are clogged with a terreſtrial thickneſſe, they doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cloy and ouerlay nature, before ſhe can extract their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne
quality, concoct their cruditie, and deuide their earthly groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and impurity: the which being her taſke and burden,
ſhee fainteth before ſhee can receiue any helpe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>And that we may not digreſſe from our ſimilitude, let vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that which is ſaid, to fire, whereof we haue ſpoken before.
As we ſée fire when it is ouerwhelmed with many aſhes, and
hindered from taking aier, (by which it is nouriſhed) is eaſily
ſmoothered and put out: and that the ſame againe is ſtirred vp,
if a man with his hand doe take away the aſhes, and doe blowe
the ſparkes which remaine, giuing frée acceſſe of the aier: héere
the cauſe of the fires refreſhing and beginning againe, is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to him which remoued the Aſhes, when as indéede hee
was but the inſtrument of reſtoring the fire.</p>
               <p>But the principal efficient conſiſteth in the fire it ſelfe, the
which he had ſpread abroad and winded or bellowſed in vaine,
<pb facs="tcp:10505:76"/>
if it had bene quite and cleane out. Therefore that renuing is
to be attributed to the fire alone which remained, as to the firſt,
next, and inſet cauſe, onely the outward ventilation or winding
comming betwéene as the inſtrument.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as we ſée, that when the fire is ſo weake, that
very fewe ſparkes are to bee found, that then in vaine a
great heape of dead coales are caſt vpon the ſame to make a
ſpéedy fire, which will ſooner put altogether out, then make a
quick fire.</p>
               <p>But if thou put vpon them quicke burning coales, they will
by and by increaſe the fire, without feare of extinction: euen ſo in
like maner, the principal vertue or function, is alway to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to our vital or radical Balſam, rather then to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Medicine, albeit the ſame may bee ſome helpe, in
putting away the aſhie feces, and in diſſoluing the troubled lées
which are an impediment, that ſo it may more fréely haue tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
and aire, that by them it be not oppreſſed and choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
               <p>Such is this Balſamick Medicine, which being purified,
exalted, and brought vnto the higheſt eſſence and perfection, it
doth ſtirre vppe, refreſh, and reſtore our vitall fire, liuing,
but yet languiſhing, to his former vigor and ſtrength. The
which, forſomuch as it doth ſooner, more ſafely, and more
pleaſantly performe without all compariſon then that other
ordinary and common Phyſick, thou ſhalt not miſcompare
that of theirs to dead coales, or to gréene wood, but this of ours
as prepared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and brought to a Balſam, to a burning coale, which
is the ſumme of our whole diſputation.</p>
               <p>Let theſe things ſuffice to be ſpoken concerning the property,
quality, &amp; excellency of our Balſamick medicine, which Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
prepare out of one thing onely, not out of many, whether
it be mineral, vegetal, or animal. Of this medicine alone is the
ſaying of the wiſe man to be vnderſtood,<note place="margin">Syrach. 38. 4</note> when he ſaith; The
Lord hath created medicine out of the earth, and he that is wiſe
wil not abhorre it. For by this word (Medicine) he vnderſtandeth
<pb facs="tcp:10505:76"/>
remedy, not the Art of Phyſick. For it was ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in thoſe firſt ages, to vſe this medicine, taken out of one
onely matter. But the latter age ſucceeding, after long ſearch,
found out that radical Balſam, and ſaw by experience, that it
was in ſome thing more, and in other ſome leſſe. Whatſoeuer it
is, it is knowne that they of olde time did vſe moſt ſimple reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
neither did they care for ſo great confuſion of compoſitions
and mixtures which fill a whole ware-houſe and ſhoppe, as our
Phyſitians and Apothecaries do at this day.</p>
               <p>And if we will conſider of thoſe things which <hi>Theophraſtus
Dioſcorides,</hi> and others of the auncients haue left vnto vs in
writing, concerning medicine, and the vertues of ſimple reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
we ſhal perceiue and finde, that they vſed the moſt ſimple
method and order of curing, and that they had not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the actiue or paſſiue qualities, of hote and cold, of dry and
moyſt, out of the which came the originall of ſo many mixtions
and confuſions. But it is plaine and euident, that they attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their ſimples, this and that property, either becauſe they
had ſo learned from others, peraduenture by tradition, or elſe by
experience, obſeruing the impreſſions, formes, and figures of
their ſimples.</p>
               <p>But they of more late time haue bene ſo raſh of iudgement,
that they wil take vpon them to iudge of the faculties of ſimples
by their taſte and reliſh, and thereby diſcerne and determine,
their firſt, ſecond, and third qualities, to the which afterward
all the vertue of the ſaide ſimples was attributed. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they found not this an vniuerſal rule alwaies and in all
things, and that it did deceiue, therefore ſome fled to the ſecret
and hidden properties, aryſing from the forme, and the whole
ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like ſtarting holes and ſubtilties, haue
brought vpon vs great incertainty and doubtfulneſſe, which way
to diſcerne and find out thoſe things, which ſerue for our beſt
good.</p>
               <p>Tell me I pray you (if you can) how many bitter things
<pb facs="tcp:10505:77"/>
there are in taſte, which neuertheleſſe according to the edict of
that rule, are not hote at all? Of this ſort among others many
moe is Opium and Cichory. Againe, how many ſowre things are
there, which by their rule ſhould be moſt cold, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
are moſt hote, as the ſpirits of Vineger, of Niter, and of
Sulphur? How many ſwéet things are there in outward taſte,
which in their internal ſubſtance are nothing at all contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
How many things are outwardly and at the firſt beginning
of taſte altogether vnſauory and without reliſh, which inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and in faculty,<note place="margin">A Diſſoluing water.</note> are moſt ſharpe and byting, Honey, Caſſia, and
Sugar, are in their internal ſubſtance ſo hote and violent, that
out of them alſo may be prepared ſuch diſſoluers, as are woont
to be made out of Aqua Fortis, or Aqua Regalis: which can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
gold and ſiluer as ſpéedily as the other.</p>
               <p>Lead yéeldeth out no taſte to the tongue:<note place="margin">Copper is red without and greens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</note> and yet his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſubſtance, is a certaine ſugared delightfull ſwéeteneſſe.
So outwardly Copper hath no reliſh and is of a ruddie
colour: but that gréene where into it is changed, is moſt
ſharpe.</p>
               <p>We might ſhewe of ſuch examples, almoſt an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
whereunto we muſt not raſhly giue credit, nor ſtand vpon
taſte, nor leane to much vpon the exteriour qualities and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
of things. For if they be more inwardly and exactly
examined, then by that ſuperficiary and ſlight maner of taſting
and experimenting, and that their inward bowels, be diligently
anatomized, they ſhal be found farre otherwiſe, and oftentimes
different, not onely in taſte, but alſo in odour, in colour, and in
their whole ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>But if ſo be a ſeperation be made of the thrée hypoſtaticall or
ſubſtantial eſſential beginnings, as of Salt, Sulphur, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
then there will appeare a true and lawfull difference of
taſtes. Becauſe one and the ſame ſubſtance may containe
in it ſeuerall taſtes. How then canſt thou giue a ſafe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his properties and vertues? As for example, conſider
well of <hi>Guaiacum:</hi> whoſe diuers vertues and properties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained, thou canſt not eaſily diſcerne by ſimple taſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10505:77"/>
Neither canſt thou alleage any certaine cauſe why it ſhould
be <hi>Diaphoretical,</hi> that is to ſay, apt to prouoke ſweates: which
by the ſeparation of the aforeſaid beginnings, thou canſt attaine
vnto. For thou ſhalt find in his mercurial tartneſſe, &amp; in his oylie
ſulphurus, and thinner ſubſtance, that facultie to enforce ſweate,
which is alſo in Iuniper, in Boxe, in Oake, in Aſhe, and almoſt
in al woodes and barkes, as alſo in many other things: but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
wée wil ſhewe the cauſe, why thoſe ſharpe and ſulphurus
ſubſtances, doe prouoke ſweates. But you may alſo extract out
of the ſame bitteriſh <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> a Salt apt for purgation, and
euacuation of humours. The like is to bée ſaid of <hi>Cinamom,</hi>
and almoſt of all other things. For <hi>Cinamom</hi> hath facultie both
to bind and to looſe. The opening force conſiſteth in his ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
oilie, and thinne ſubſtance, which being ſeparated from his
feces, thou ſhalt find a ſubſtance of the nature of <hi>Allum,</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
binding.</p>
               <p>Alſo whereas Opium is bitter,<note place="margin">Narcotical is Stupefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note> that commeth by reaſon of
his Salt, from the which being ſeparated by his oile or narcoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Sulphur, it becommeth purging no leſſe than out of any other
bitter thing, as if out of <hi>Gentian Centorie,</hi> &amp; ſuch like, the ſame
Salt ſhould bée ſeparated and rightly prepared.</p>
               <p>To theſe bitter Salts is giuen the name of <hi>Salt-gemme</hi> as
a difference of other Saltes, whereof there is great diuerſitie of
kindes, as more at large ſhall be ſhewed in another place. But
nowe in fewe wordes I ſay, that ſome Saltes are bitter, ſome
ſweete, ſome tart, ſowre, ſharpe, auſtere, pricking, and briniſh:
whoſe particular facultie, is rightly attributes to the proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the ſame Salt, rather than to any other qualitie, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
the ſame be.</p>

that it is traced in the darkeneſſe of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Theſe haue reſpect to the external

eſpecially to thoſe which may be ſéen, taſted,

hote, cold, moyſt and drie: which they haue made the
beginnings and firſt foundations of theſe faculties or vertues.</p>
            <p>But the Hermeticall Phyloſophers and Chymiſts, leauing
thoſe bare qualities of the bodyes, ſought the foundations of
their actions, taſtes, odours, and colours, elſe where. At the laſt
by wittie inquiſition they knew that there were thrée diſtinct ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in euery natural elemented body: that is to ſay, Salt,
Sulphur, and Mercurie. And theſe internal beginnings of
things, they called hypoſtatical vertual, and ordinatiue begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.
For in theſe thrée hypoſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tical beginnings, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
vertual and ſenſible qualities, are to be found, not by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
analogie, or coniecture, but in very déede and in effect.
That is to ſay, taſtes in Salt, moſt chiefly: odours, in Sulphur:
colours out of both, but moſt chiefely out of Mercurie: becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:10505:78"/>
Mercurie hath the volatile Salt of al things,<note place="margin">Taſte, odour, and colours.</note> ioyned vnto it.</p>
            <p>For there are two kindes of ſalts,<note place="margin">Salt of 2. ſorts.</note> the one fixed, other vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile,
as ſhal be ſhewed anon.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſalt is firme,<note place="margin">Salt defined.</note> fixed, and ſubſtantifying begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of al things: and therefore it is compared with the pure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement
of Earth.<note place="margin">Salt and earth.</note> Becauſe falt is not cold &amp; dry by his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as it is holden of ſome that the Earth is) the which quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are the death of things: but it is rather hote, and endued
with an actiue qualitie, for that it is appointed to ſerue for the
generation of all things.</p>
            <p>Sulphur is compared to fire,<note place="margin">Sulphur and Fire.</note> for as fire, ſo ſulphur doth quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take flame and burne: euen as alſo do al other things, which
partake of the nature thereof, ſuch as are Roſinie, fat, and oylie.</p>
            <p>Mercurie by Analogie anſwereth the Ayre,<note place="margin">Mercurie, Ayre, and Water,</note> and Water.
For not only that dry minerall water, (which is alſo called <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drargire</hi>
and Quick-ſiluer) is called Mercurie: but alſo euery
water or actiue liquor endued with any vertue, is alſo for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
thereof called Mercurie. The which Mercurie, (as we
haue ſaid) may bée likened to either Element, that is to ſay, to
Ayre, and to Water: to Ayre, becauſe when it is put to the fire,
it is found almoſt nothing but Ayre, or a vapour, which vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
away.<note place="margin">Mercurie a moyſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note> This if you pleaſe you may call a moyſt actiue.</p>
            <p>And it may bée compared to water alſo, becauſe it is running:
and ſo long as it continueth in his owne nature, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in his owne liſtes, but in the limmits of another: which
according to <hi>Arictotle,</hi> is the definition of moyſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe thrée beginnings, (I ſay) are found in all bodyes as
internal and neceſſarie ſubſtances for the compoſition of a mixt
body.</p>
            <p>For ſeeing the foreſaid Mercurial, volatile, and ſpirituall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miditie,
cannot eaſily be conioyned with the earthie, corporeat,
and fixed part, by reaſon of that great difference and contrariety
of either of them: it is neceſſarily required, that there ſhould bée
a meane, and indifferent partaking of either: that is, as wel
of the ſpirituall as of the fixed, to conioyne both in one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10505:79"/>
And this indifferent meane is Sulphur or oile,<note place="margin">Sulphur the meane to ioyne ſalt and Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> which hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a meane betwéene that which is fixed, and that which is
flying. For oyles, are neuer ſo quickly, ſo eaſily, and ſo wel di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled,
as are waters: becauſe the ſubſtance of Sulphur, or of
an oylie bodie is tenax and retentiue, and therefore moſt apt to
combinde the other two, to effect a good, perfect and equal mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>To make the matter more plaine by example. For as a man
can neuer make good cloſing morter, of water and ſand onely,
without the mixture of lime, which bindeth the other two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like oile and glue: ſo Sulphur or the oily ſubſtance, is the
mediator of Salt and Mercurie, and coupleth them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
neither doth it onely couple them to death, but it doth alſo
repreſſe and contemperate the acrimonie of Salt, and the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Mercurie, which is found to bée very much therein.
Much like to the coniunction which the Spirite and quickening
moyſt radical maketh betwéene the ſoule, and incorporeat ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and the body, which very much differeth from the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thus then it appeareth,<note place="margin">Three na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one.</note> after what manner theſe thrée na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
may conſiſt in one, together, and ſo to be made a mixed and
perfect bodie. For as ſalt by it ſelfe a lone cannot bring this thing
to paſſe: euen ſo neither theſe two fluxible and mouing humors,
cannot without Salt by their nature compoſe a firme, fixed, and
ſolyd body.</p>
            <p>Moreouer Sulphur moſt néedes bée had as a Glue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which the Mercurial liquor wil be ſwallowed vp by the
drineſſe of the terreſtrial Salt, and through the violence of the
heate of the fire, which by the Sulphur is contained. But the
Mercurial humour, is as it were the chariot of the other two,
ſeruing to penetrate, and to make the mixture eaſie and ſpéedy.</p>
            <p>If there bée any man, which through obſtinacie, or blockiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of wit, doth not well conceiue and vnderſtand this: let him
beholde and conſider of the blood which is in mans body, how
in the ſame, the whaye is as a chariot or mediator, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biner
of the other two beginnings together, as may appeare by
the preparation and ſeparation thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10505:79"/>
Very fitly wée may vſe this example in this place. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
by infallable and euident demonſtration, we wil ſhew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what manner, the other two beginnings, beſide the whaye
(which ſupplyeth the place of Mercuries) are in blood.<note place="margin">Salt cauſeth Vicers in the body.</note> When
Salt is predominate and beareth the ſwaye, it produceth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
kinds of diuers Vicers and many other diſeaſes: beſide that
portion of ſalt which paſſeth through the reines and bladder, by
Vrines. In like maner we haue already ſhewed how Sulphur,
or the oilie part, is in the ſame blood. This ſulphur being exalted, it
cauſeth ſulphurus exhalation, as inflamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, from whence come
ſo many kindes of Feauers. So, Mercurial ſublimations raiſe
Rheumes and Catarres, with other diſeaſes Mercurial.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chymiſtes</hi> determine, that there are ſundry kindes of ſalt, which
as they are found apart in nature, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> alſo in all mixt bodyes.</p>
            <p>That is to ſay, common ſalt (which the Sea by his ſecret
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Allum (whereof there are diuers kindes) Vitriol, Salt-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,
and Salt-Niter, which men commonly call Salt peter.</p>
            <p>Among theſe ſalts, two are flying, and are mixed with
liquors after an inſenſible manner: that is to ſay, Niter, &amp; Salt-Armoniac
of nature. Niter doth participate of ſulphur, and of
the oylie liquor of things: Armoniac partaketh of Mercurie,
or of the Mercurial humour of things.</p>
            <p>And theſe foreſaid ſalts, (which are found both in earthie, and
metallick ſubſtances) are deriued through the benefite of rootes,
into hearbs, plants, and trées: which becauſe they are alwayes
in the earth, they retaine the nature moſt chiefly of fixed ſalt.</p>
            <p>And after the ſame manner, the nature of fixed ſalt, is to bée
ſought for in rootes. In flowers alſo and in leaues, there is
great ſtore of the other two flying Salts, which béeing ſuch,
they eaſily vaniſh away and come to nothing; when the flowers
and leaues doe wyther and waxe dry. But thoſe plants and
hearbes which take their nouriſhment from fixed ſalt, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
kept flowriſhing and gréene: and therefore they doe
the more ſtrongly reſiſt the fainting heate of Sommer, and the
morifying cold of Winter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10505:80"/>
Moreouer, their Rootes ſtanding déepe in the ground, they
doe the more eaſily withſtand all external iniuries. And when
the Spring commeth, and the Sunne ſendeth foorth his heate
entring into the ſigne of <hi>Aries,</hi> piercing the earth with his quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
beames, hée ſtirreth the ſame, and cauſeth her to open her
boſome, out of the which at the laſt ſhée powreth foorth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
thoſe two liquid beginnings, whereof wée haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before.</p>
            <p>The liquor, or Mercurial vapour, which is lifted vp through
the Rootes with Salt Armoniac of a volatile nature (by a
certaine wonderfull manner of nature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> diſtilling) and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

may eaſily bée disbarked) raiſeth vp, quickeneth, and adorneth
with gréene leaues, trees and plants, now hanging downe their
heads, and halfe dead. And the other kinde of volatile ſalt. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre-ſulphurus,
mixed with the more volatile ſulphur, and oyle of
nature, doth cloath and decke the whole earth euery wherewith
ſundry ſorts of moſt beautiful flowers.</p>
            <p>And yet wée muſt not thinke héereupon, that one vaporous
liquor, which procéedeth out of the earth, is not partaker of the
other, ſéeing the Mercurial liquor is not without his ſulphurus,
nor the ſulphurus without his Mercurial. And this is the
cauſe why in the vegetable nature, wée doe ſée that ſome
doe put out their leaues and flowers ſooner than other
ſome.</p>
            <p>Nature therefore hath moſt wiſely diſtributed thoſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
into all things. And experience doth teach, that ſomethings
doe partake of this or that, more than ſome other things. For
thou canſt not eaſily draw an oyle out of leaues: but a mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
liquor plentifully out of al: and out of very fewe, ſome ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurus,
or oylie liquor. The reaſon is, becauſe Mercurie doth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the rule in leaues, and is their chiefe nouriſhment, beginning
and foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we haue already ſaid.<note place="margin">Mercurie is properly extracted from leaues.</note> But the ſulphurus liquor
is the cauſe of the increaſe &amp; plentie of flowers, but yet the ſame
ſulphur is not alone and pure, but mixed with ſome portion of
Mercurial liquor, but with the leaſt quantitie of ſalt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10505:80"/>
For this cauſe thou maieſt extract out of flowers, both Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
or oyle, and alſo Mercurie, but that oyle more volatil: and
of Salt, the leaſt quantity. But out of ſéedes is extracted
much of the more fixed Sulphur,<note place="margin">Sulphur out of Seedes.</note> but of Mercury and Salt
almoſt nothing. The cauſe is, for that Sulphur hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
beginning and the principal conſtitution, (not that vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til

are in great Mercurial hearbes and fleſhlike fruites, as in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">Salt out of wood and rootes.</note>
Peares, Goordes, and ſuch like. But Salt is in all theſe,
as the moſt fixed and neceſſarie beginning, for the conſtitution
and compacting of all bodies. But this Salt doth moſt chiefely

               </gap>ide in the wood, and in the roote, not as in his center or proper
ſeate fixed, (for his principal rooting is in the earth) but becauſe
it is firſt and moſt plentifully communicated to the wood and
roote. From hence afterward much is deriued to the branches
and leaues, and but little to the flowers and fruites.</p>
            <p>Whereupon out of many leaues a ſufficient quantity of ſalt
may be extracted: but out of flowers and ſéedes a very ſmal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
in regard of the others.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſée after what maner theſe thrée beginnings doe
order and determine all vegetables as hypoſtatical beginnings,
and doe bring them forth, conſerue, make them to ſprout and
floriſh, and doe giue vnto them diuers forces and vertues. It is
alſo euident, that the ſaide thrée beginnings, are in all things, but
in ſome more, and in other ſome leſſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore,<note place="margin">A mixture of the 3. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings.</note> none of thoſe thrée beginnings is found ſimple,
and alone, which doth not paticipate alſo with another. For
Salt, through the benefite of the other two Saltes, Niter
and Armoniac, containeth in it ſelfe an oylely and a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiall
ſubſtance: Sulphur containeth a Salte, and a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
ſubſtance: and Mercurie a Sulphurus and Salt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

            <p>But yet, if we conſider of the matter exactly, we ſhal finde
that al the other doe ſpring from ſalt,<note place="margin">Salt, the root of the other beginnings.</note> as from the firme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

            <p>And foraſmuch as thoſe thrée ſubſtancefying beginnings

            <p>Salt which is alluminous, giueth a ſower taſte: Vitriol a ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
or a ſtringent taſte: Armoniac a ſharpe taſte. And a diuers
mixture of the ſame Salts, procureth ſundry taſtes and reliſhes:
and that moſt chiefely by the benefit of the two volatile Salts,
which of all other wil be beſt mingled, by reaſon of their ſubtilty
and ſpiritous ſubſtance. Armoniac, which is ſharp, is more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
in vitriol, and in things vitriolated, then in any other Salt
ſubſtance or metallick. For that ſharpe Salt, or that ſharpeneſſe
of nature, is the fermentation thereof, and the cauſe of coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and of the diſſolutions of all things: as we haue already
touched before, and will in another place more manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
Therefore it is certaine, that thoſe things which are ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
or ſtopping, and haue outwardly a gréene colour or vitriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with an inward ſharpneſſe and certaine rednes, (as is to be
ſeene in <hi>Pomegranats, Barberies,</hi> and <hi>Limons)</hi> it is certaine that
they haue it from vitriol, and from the ſharp Salt Armoniac: for
the vitriol of nature is outwardly gréene, and red within, if thou
ſearch it by ſkilful Anatomie.</p>
            <p>So alſo thou maieſt extract out of the barke of the ſaid fruits,
as of Granates, a ſubſtance comming moſt néere to the vertue of
vitriol.<note place="margin">Diſſoluing liquors.</note> And the liquor which is extracted out of their red graines,
or out of the iuice of <hi>Limons,</hi> or fruite of <hi>Barberies,</hi> hath force to
<pb facs="tcp:10505:82"/>
diſſolue pearles, and corall, euen as the ſpirit of vitriol hath. And
this commeth by the vertue of Salt Armoniac ſharpe of nature,
and by the nature of mixture: but ſo mixed, as by the induſtrie
of the artificer it may be ſeperated, in ſuch wife, that the ſame
Salt Armoniac being extracted, the ſame liquor will be made
ſwéete and potable, and the Salt remaine by it ſelfe: the which
being againe mixed with ſpring water, or with any other liquor
deuoid of taſte, it wil make the ſame ſharpe.</p>
            <p>That ſame ſharpneſſe or Salt Armoniac ſpirituall, is
not onely found in Vitriol, but alſo in common Salt, in Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yea in Sulphur alſo it ſelfe, as alſo in all things. For
that ſharpneſſe is that very ſame, which coagulateth Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
which is plentifully found therein. For without it, Sulphur
will not cleane vnited, but would be running, as are other oyle-like
liquors.</p>
            <p>The ſame Salt Armoniac of nature, is manifeſted vnto vs,
by that extraction of ſharpe oyle, which is drawen out of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur:
whoſe nature is farre different from that of the ſaid Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.
For it is ſo farre from taking fleame, that contrariwiſe,
it is a hinderance to gun-poulder, not-ſuffering it to be infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the touch of fire,<note place="margin">Diſſoluing liquor.</note> as is ſaid already. The ſame liquor
doth diſſolue pearles and coral, no leſſe then doth the iuice of
Limons, of Barberies, or any other of that nature, the which
power it hath by the diſſoluing vertue of Salt Armoniac of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which is in it. The like, and by the ſame reaſon, doth
Vineger performe. For Wine (as is ſaide afore) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh
of the nature of Vitriol, more then any other ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable,
and containeth much of the foreſaide ſharpe Salt of

            <p>He which doth exactly conſider theſe things, ſhal readily, and
out of true grounded reaſons, diſſolue the queſtion, concerning
the true and natural qualitie of Vineger, which queſtion hath
troubled many of the moſt learned Piyſitians. For the diſſoluing
vertue which appeareth to be in Vineger, euen in this, that when
clay or earth is put into it, it wil as it were boyle, argueth that
the nature thereof is altogether hote.</p>

ſtrong waters, (which are nothing elſe but the ſpirits of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

one hundred pound waight of Vitriol and Niter, as they are in
their owne nature and body, yet they will neuer be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
it.</p>
            <p>It is therefore manifeſt, that ſuch violent forces and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are onely in the ſpirits, ſeperated, euaporated, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued

            <p>But peraduenture there are ſome, which now thinking that

which indéed are ſpirits partaking of the terreſtrial fire,
yet neuertheleſſe they may bee ſo ſwéetened, and mingled with

            <p>To this we anſwere, that as we haue ſpoken it, ſo we will

yea and which is yet more wonderfull, euen in the middeſt

            <p>And concerning diſſolution, it ſhall not be neceſſary that we

that Sulphur, or that Salt Armoniac ſharpe of nature, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

            <p>Being brought into this forme, it is commonly called Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimate.

to this new Vitriol, that by his Salt Armoniac of nature, it
may be impregnated. And thus at the laſt it becommeth ſolid, and

            <p>
               <hi>Spargeric</hi> Phyloſophers, can ſo diſpoyle againe this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie

            <p>And now, if the foreſaid water be exhaled or vapored, that there
may remaine nothing but a ſharpe liquor, like vnto the ſpirit of

which was mixed with Mercurie (which was then nothing but
a certaine terreſtrial corroſiue fire) thou ſhalt now haue the true

is conſumed and loſt, if it bee extracted according to the

to take an example from our owne body, to manifeſt this thing,
the vrine which we make, is ſo repleniſhed with theſe mercurial

haue, by which they are woont ſo readily to conſume all the meat
in their ſtomach, that nature hath ſcarce lawful ſpace to nouriſh
her ſelfe: and from whence this inſatiable hunger commeth.
According to the common opinion, it befalleth ſome man to haue
this appetite, by reaſon of a certaine ſharpe and melancholick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
which being thruſt downe into his ſides, doth ſometimes
boyle vp like moſt ſtrong vinegar, or rather in déed like oile of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,

by good and indifferent men, that it ſhould not more vnfitly to
bée ſayde vitriolated, than melancholicke: nay more aptly and
better: becauſe melancholie, neither can, nor hath béen woont
to worke ſuch effects, except by the ſowreneſſe aforeſaid. For
by this manner of ſpeaking, the diſſoluing vertue, and al other
properties, are in farre better ſort expreſſed, which ſhal eaſily

ſée differences of fires and ſmoakes in combuſtible woods,
whereof ſome are more clammie, ſome more ſalt, ſome ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
and ſuch like diuerſities.</p>
            <p>The ſame diuerſitie alſo is to bée ſéene in the ſeparation of
the ſpirits of Léeſe, of Ale, of Cider, of Wine, of <hi>Hydromel,</hi>
and of ſuch like drinkes, the diuerſititie whereof doth manifeſtly
appeare, by the odours which doe abundantly aſcend into the

            <p>Alſo in Saltes, Sulphurs and oyles, which are diſtilled, the
diuerſitie of vapoures, (which are nothing but the ſpirits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
out of many tartarous matters) doe manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the ſame. For of theſe, ſome are ſharpe, ſome ſowre,

            <p>The ſame differences are to be made in Antimonials, Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicals,
and Mineral humours, or vapours, and that out of their
effect, either ſeplic putrifying, or cauſtic burning, the which effects
are in the ſaid fumes, by the meanes of ſalt. Such pearcing
fumes are too wel knowne, and felt of our eyes oftentimes, to
which they bring by their ſharpeneſſe, paines, inflamations, and
flowing of teares. Héereupon out of this diuerſitie of fumes,
there ariſe diuers paſſions, in continuance, in maladie, and in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie,
more or leſſe inuading and troubling, according to the
nature, mineral, and condition of the qualitie or quantitie of the
exhalations, and of their ſubſtances, which are lifted vp with
them, as it were in a certaine chariot.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, we ſée in the bowels of the earth of the little world,
man, no leſſe then in the great worlds belly: in the bellies I ſay
of both, almoſt the ſame effects are to bée ſeene of Meteors, as
wel waterie as fierie. For example, the Tympanie, the ſwelling
of the Coddes, windineſſe of the ſtomach, and bellie: al which
doe repreſent the windes, raynes, and Earth-quakes of the

            <p>There are alſo procreated in mans bodie, certaine concreate &amp;

Salt, in malignant and peſtilent humours. From the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the which Saltes, but moſt eſpecially of the ſtiplick or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding

degenerate into contractions of the bowels: From
the corroſiue Salts ſpring diuers kindes of diſenterie fluxes:
from the briniſh ſalts, come the burnings of Vlrines: from the

Arſenicall Salts, comes Carbuncles cankerous Vlcers, running

which are ingendred and procreate to nature, in our body. From
theſe things, are the cauſes of diſeaſes in mans body, to be truely
and exactly learned and diſcerned: without the which wée ſhal in

            <p>But to make al which, hath béene hitherto ſpoken more plaine,
wée wil adde certayne manifeſt demonſtrations, and playne
to ſenſe, but yet in as briefe manner as I can, ſéeing wée haue
reſerued a more ample and ſpecial Treatiſe of theſe things to our
worke, concerning the hidden nature of things.</p>
            <p>It is known and confeſſed of al, by the Edict of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi>
the chiefeſt Authour of Phiſitians, that our body conſiſteth of
things containing of things contained, and of things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing.
The things containing, are the ſolide and more firme
partes, as the bones, griſtles, ligaments, fleſh, which doe
containe, and as it were reſtraine, the more ſoft and delicate
parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10505:89"/>
The contents are in a two-fold difference: ſome are violent
breathing out, and enforcing: (as Phyſitians ſpeake) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
moyſtening, and flowing out. The firſt ſort, are the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of our radical Balſam, which they call naturall ſpirits,
whether they bée firmely fixed in any one part, or whether
they haue ſcope and recourſe throughout the whole body; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
of the moſt pure ſubſtance ſpiritual of the Sulphurus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
and of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the nouriſhments of our life. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
they diuide the ſpirits, into natural, vital, and animal.</p>
            <p>All theſe, are either natural and pure, or elſe impure and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent.
The one are of a moſt pure nature, ethereal and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of life: the other groſſe and impure in compariſon of them,
ſubiect to alterations, for that they participate much of the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
impuritie of Mercurie, and of the liquors of Salt, and alſo
of the aliments of Sulphur: of the which beginnings wée doe
conſiſt, as wée ſaid before. The moyſtening parts are mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
liquors, or that which they commonly call humours, as
well the natural, profiting and nouriſhing, which retaine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the ſpirit of life, as the vnprofitable and excremental.</p>
            <p>The out-flowing and breathing foorth, are the breathes, vnder
which name alſo wée comprehend the vapours, of the which we
made mention before: which vapours are a diſtillation, and that
moyſt euaporation, taken from the more watery part of humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or mercurial things: or elſe a dry exhalation; of Sulphurus
and tartarous things, and of Salts of our body.</p>
            <p>And ſuch exhalations alſo are no other thing, but fumes and
ſpiritual ſmoakes, but yet excremental, and therefore ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
For beſide thoſe firſt ſeperations, which nature maketh
out of the more groſſe part of nouriſhments, by the excretion
and ſeparation of the ordinarie impure feces: there are yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in the <hi>Chylus,</hi> or good Iuice, and in the very blood,
which of all other humours are moſt noble, certaine ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
impurities, which for the ſame cauſe Nature ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateth.</p>
            <p>Therefore the more m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yſt ſuperfluities are ſeparated by eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
and thoſe onely which are ſeperated in the third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
<pb facs="tcp:10505:89"/>
which could not be made ſemblable or like to the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
parts. For the which cauſe nature expelleth them by in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſenſible
paſſages, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the pores of the ſkin, that our natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral

of the heart comforted.</p>
            <p>The breathing ſuperfluities alſo, doe paticipate as much of
the drie as of the moyſt: that is to ſay, of thoſe which are exhaled
and euaporated out of the ſulphurus ſalt matters, and mercurial
liquors. Whereof the more thinne and breathie part, paſſe by
inſenſible tranſpirations: the more waterie, by ſweates: but
the more foule, and that which is feculent, cleaueth to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of the ſkinne.</p>
            <p>But now, if ſuch vapouring exhalations be retained ſtil in our
body, (the which ſometime commeth to paſſe through the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

then it cannot be, but that ſuch bodies ſhal be ſubiect to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other diſeaſes, than thoſe whereof we haue ſpoken before.</p>
            <p>It is alſo to bée remembred in this place, that in all theſe eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
&amp; ordinarie exhalations, ſomewhat of our ſubſtance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
nectar of life, or of our radical Balſam, doth alſo breathe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
The which breathing, if it be gently and ſparingly, and
without all manner violence and force, but by a certaine volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
continuance, and naturall, then our age is prolonged, in the
meane time declining to extreame old age by little and little, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
al our water of life, or radical oyle (which continueth the
lampe of our life) be conſumed.</p>
            <p>But if the ſayd exhalation or breathing bée violently
and ſuddenly enforced, as it commeth to paſſe in burning fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
and in many other ſickneſſes, faintings, paſſions, and
moſt vehement motions of the ſpirits of our body, then our life
ſhall be preuented before age. Haereupon commeth the vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in ſome ſort, the violant death of many: and yet the cauſe
of ſuch violence comming from an internal occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10505:90"/>
And becauſe it is very pertinent and neceſſarie, that wée
rightly vnderſtand thoſe things which wée haue now ſpoken,
concerning the natures of the contents in vs, that is to
ſay, of the enforcings, moyſtenings, and out-flowings: and ſo
much the rather, becauſe by them wée come to the knowledge of
our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pirits, and of our radicial moyſture, or nectar of life, and
alſo to the cauſes of the conſeruation, prolongation, deſtruction,
and abreuiation of our life, I wil therefore now declare them all
by an example, whereby euery one which wil giue eare, may
come to the perfect knowledge of thoſe things.</p>
            <p>And yet wée doe not much eſtéeme preſumptions, probable
reaſons, or authorities, but wée wil ground our demonſtration
vppon the very ſenſes themſelues, that thoſe things which wée
ſpeake, may bée both ſéene and felt. And if ſo bée any bée ſo
farre deuoyd of ſhame, that hée will yet obſtinately contradict vs,
we will ſay to him, as ſometime <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>errho</hi> ſaid: <hi>One experience, is
more of value, than many reaſons.</hi> Experience cannot bée without
ſenſe: &amp; he which denieth ſenſe, is worthy to haue no vſe of ſenſe.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayd, that the foundation of all
demonſtration is in ſenſe, Who is hee that dare gaineſay
it.</p>
            <p>Therefore wée wil take Wine againe for an example,
forſomuch as wée vſed the ſame before. In which wine
how apparantly and manifeſtly doe ſuch ſeparations; and
excrements appeare to bée made? And this it doth by his owne
proper nature, that the more eaſily the nature of either of
them, and of both, may manifeſtly bée knowen by this Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
and reſemblance which it hath with our blood. For by
the clenſing of wine, wée know the vitall Anatomie of
our blood: and by the ſame it will appeare which are our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ſpirits ethereal, as alſo which is our natiue heate, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall
moyſture, which two doe vphold our body, and defend
our life, and of whoſe helpe either of them haue néede:
foraſmuch as that radicall moyſture is the foode and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher
of heate, and this ſame heate ſubſiſteth by the benefite of
that moyſture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10505:90"/>
Thus theſe two repleniſhed with ſpirit, and as it were knit
together, are ſpred and diffuſed through the whole body. By this
ſame example, the difference betwéene nouriſhing vital humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and that which is vnprofitable and excremental, wil plainly
appeare. Furthermore, it wil appeare which be moyſt, and which
be dry, in that kind of moyſtures which are outflowing: and
which of them are hurtful to our nature, and which profitable.
By which anatomie of blood, the reader willing to learne, ſhal
profit more (as I thinke) becauſe we referre thoſe foure humors,
(whereof they make blood one) to the very ſame, and doe by a
certaine analogie and reſemblance, compare it therewith. But to
come to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Therefore when the wine is prepared, the cluſters of grapes
are cruſhed in the wine-preſſe firſt, and the ſkinnes and kernels
with the ſtalkes are throwne away. Then the vnprofitable clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
and excrements, being partly by mans induſtrie, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the nature of the wine it ſelfe being reiected, the wine is
powred into caſkes and veſſels. In theſe, digeſtion being made, by
his owne force, it ſeperateth and purgeth forth together thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent
and more groſſe ſuperfluities. This done, the wine is all
moſt perfect, and fit for drinke and nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>That firſt artificiall preperation of wine, (which is made by
the expreſſion and ſeparation of the Vintners) doth after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
manner repreſent vnto vs, the preparation of wheate, in
the which ſeparation, the chaffe and the branne being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
the reſt is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d into meale, that it may be more fit for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.
Euen ſo in like maner in our mouthes, firſt preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the fleſh is made from the bones, or ſuch like: And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
or grinding is made with the mouth and téeth, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
due chewing, the meate is ſent down into the ſtomach. This
is the firſt reſembled preparation of our nouriſhment, with that
firſt preparation of wine, and wheate, and that which is put into
our ſtomach, anſwereth that wine, which at the firſt is put into
veſſels, &amp; the meale which is ground. Therefore after this, there
is another working in the ſtomach by nature. For whatſoeuer
the ſtomach receiueth, it concocteth, and digeſteth: yea all kind of
<pb facs="tcp:10505:91"/>
meates mixed together, like wine in his caſk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of drinke, made of hony, fruites, barley, or of water wherein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
things are ſodden.</p>
            <p>The ſtomach therefore is that veſſell of nature, wherein not
only the matter put into it is concocted and digeſted: but alſo it is
the ſame which ſeperateth the tartarous feces, and whatſoeuer
is excremental therein, by ſuch paſſages and vents, as nature
hath prouided to that end. At the length after much purifying, the
blood is clenſed, being the red fountaine, and the original of the
ſpirits of our life: euen like as wine which throughly fined is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before all others, which ſerue for the nouriſhing and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

               </gap>pe of gentle fire, by

nature, which attendeth the radical moyſture: namely, a water of
life, wholy fiery and ethereal, a quinteſſence, altogether ſpiritual,
and almoſt of an incorruptible nature.</p>
            <p>After the very ſame manner, through the benefite of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and by Circulation which is made by the heate of the
Heart, and of the Liuer, there is generated and extracted
in vs that quickening fire, accompanied and nouriſhed with
his proper vnctuous humour, and radical, which is the water of
life, and true and quickening Nectar, the quinteſſence, and almoſt
the ethereal ſpirit, the incorruptible vpholder and conſeruer of
our life.</p>
            <p>This alſo here by the way commeth to be noted in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the foreſaid wine, which is alſo worthy the marking and

more to bée maruailed at and obſerued, when the ſame ſpirit of
wine, doth paſſe through the Colunrina (as they terme it)
namely by very long cunduites and pipes of braſſe reforſed, fit

handle them. The which is to bee attributed to the great
heate which the ſpirit of wine giueth to the colde water paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
through the foreſaide pipes. For when all the ſpirit of
wine is diſtilled forth; although thou put vnder the ſaide veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
a much more vehement fire, yet thou ſhalt féele the heate
of that water in the veſſel contained, to bée extinguiſhed and
cooled. The which ſhould put vs in minde what is the next
cauſe and original of natural or connatural heate in vs: for this
heate is ſtirres vp in vs by the continual circulation of the quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening

            <p>When all this water of life is at laſt diſtilled forth by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

waſted by progreſſe of time, then doth appeare the extinction of
that quickening heate, and cold death inſueth. But to returne to
the matter.</p>
            <p>After the extraction of the true <hi>Aqua-Vitae,</hi> or ſpirit of wine,
(which is the whole purity of thoſe thrée ſubſtantial beginnings)
whole liquor repreſenteth Mercury, whoſe flame, which it
readily conceiueth, ſheweth the Sulphurus nature, and the
excéeding ſtrong taſte, declareth the ſpirit of Salt Armoniac)
there remaineth great plenty of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>eame, or of Mercurial wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which as yet containeth ſome quantity of ſpirit of wine.</p>
            <p>But the laſt remainder is no better then vnprofitable water,
which ſoone corrupteth in like manner, after the extraction of the
water of life, (which is truly ſpiritual,) from out of our
blood, there remaineth in our body, that moyſt and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening
liquor, which is partly nouriſhing, and partly excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
as is ſaide afore. Laſtly, there remaine ouer
and aboue the former, the Feces Tartarous reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Niterus Sulphurus matter, which containe
many ſtinking Impurities, as alſo greate plentie of
Salt.</p>
            <p>The impurities, doe ſufficiently ſhewe the impurities in
<pb facs="tcp:10505:92"/>
the eyes, and filthy ſtinkes out of the noſthrils, where as diuers
oyles are diſtilled out of the ſaid feces by vehement fire. And out
of the very feces there is extracted Salt, if they be calcined, and
the ſame is alſo fixed with his proper fleame, as we haue ſhewed
afore in the working of the ſame vegetable. This Salt is made
Volatil, with Salt Armoniac, flying contained in his own ſpirit,
or water of life, procéeding as we haue already ſhewed.</p>
            <p>In like ſort in blood, beſide that ſpirit of life and Mercurial li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
(which two may in very déede be ſeperated from blood it
ſelfe, and ſhewed to the eye, after conuenient digeſtions, in the
heate of <hi>Balne Mary,</hi> which reſembleth the heate of nature, that
it may the better and more eaſily appeare, how the ſame heate,
and the ſame nature in vs, maketh the ſame ſeperations and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations)
I ſay, beſide thoſe two, a certaine ſoft conſiſtence like
liquor, wil reſide in the bottome, wherein thou ſhalt finde many
impurities, to be ſéene and ſmelt, if the ſame matter be dryed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a fire of aſhes, proportionable to the heate of a feauer, and no

            <p>This Niter-Sulphurus ſtinke is that, which manifeſtly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
in vs fiery meteors, as wel in the vpper, as in the inferiour
part of the body, and which bringeth forth innumerable paſſions
and paines beſide, as is already ſhewed afore.</p>
            <p>So alſo by the force of the fire, Sulphurs and oyles, thick and
gluing like pitch, may be ſeperated out of the feces and tartar of
blood, no leſſe then out of wine, ſo offenſiue with ſtinke, as thou
art not able to abide the odour thereof: whereof, how many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
may ariſe in our bodies, euery man may eaſily coniecture.</p>
            <p>This done, there wil remaine aſhes, out of which a Salt is
extracted, the which (by the vertue of the Salt Armoniac of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
may be made Volatil, and the very ſame which <hi>Lullie</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the greater <hi>Lunarie,</hi> for the imitation of the vegetable work.
This worke is very admirable, by which the true Numie, the
vniuerſal Medicine, and the true Balſam conſeruing and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
nature is made. And this is the true and vital anatomie of
blood, which by manifeſt demonſtration we haue ſhewed, that
it hath a great analogie, proportion and reſemblance with wine:
<pb facs="tcp:10505:92"/>
when as a true Phyloſopher, as wel out of the one as out of the
other (ſauing that the one requireth greater artifice) knoweth
how to ſeperate waters of life méerely ſpirituall, which are ſaide
to be very forcible and ſtrong: and beſide theſe, Mercuriall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
which are as wel profitable as hurtful, which are alſo
moyſtening: and finally, which knoweth how to extract vapors,
and exhalations fuming, which are called out-flowings.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, if ſo be in wine, which we eaſily vſe to nouriſh
our bodies, and the ſame pure and cleare after the ſeperation of
the ſpirit thereof, we ſée and behold ſo many vnkindly things, and
ſo impure; how many more groſſe impurities I pray you ſhall
we finde in the Lées of wines cleaning to the caſkes, and in the
groſſe reſidence of the ſame?</p>
            <p>They which knowe and vnderſtand that great and excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
blackneſſe of wine lées (which is manifeſtly to be ſéene in
the calcination thereof) and the ſepreation of his ſpirit, and of his
oyle, red, blacke and ſtinking, which is done by deſtillation,
they (I ſay) can giue cleare teſtimony and credibly informe,
what a great ſtinke there is in the Sulphur thereof: and how
great the acrimony and byting ſharpneſſe is in the ſame tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
or lées, by reaſon of the Salt which is extracted out of
the ſame, and the oyle which is made by the reſolution of the
ſame Salt of tartar. And truſt mée, in the feces of the ſame
wine, there are found, beſide the things already ſpoken,
thoſe matters which are more groſſe, impure and ſtinking,
as they wel knowe, who to calcine them into aſhes (which they
call clanelated) are compelled to goe out of the Cities into the
fieldes, and places further off, by reaſon of their excéeding infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſtinke, with the which they are wont to infect the places
néere adioyning.</p>
            <p>What maruaile is it then, as is ſhewed afore, if in our blood,
after the ſeperation of the true ſpirit, there are found ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vnkindly, tartarous, ſtinking and Sulphurus impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
But what maruaile I ſay, if more and greater impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
and ſtinkes, are to bee found in diuers of the Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneal
parts of the Chylus, or beſt matter digeſted in the
<pb facs="tcp:10505:93"/>
ſtomach for nouriſhment, from whence blood draweth his firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his compoſition? That tartar or lées, is of the blood
which cleaueth to the veſſels of the bowels. Now the feces of
the Chylus are nothing elſe, but that huge heape of excrements
of diuers ſorts, which are in that nouriſhment exiſting in diuers
parts of the body. And when thoſe Niter-Sulphurus and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarous
impurities, cannot by nature be digeſted, ouercome and
expelled, they ſtuffe the bowels, they are made the ſeminarie and
ſtore-houſe of moſt grieuous ſickneſſes: ſo that if we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, we muſt of neceſſity ſay with great <hi>Hipocrates,</hi> that
ſickneſſes haue both their ſéedes, and alſo their rootes in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
the which moſt euidently appeareth by the foreſaide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of wine and blood. The which ſtandeth vpon apparant
and ſenſible foundations, and not vpon doubtfull figments and
Imaginations.</p>
            <p>And as we ſée in the ſpring times, when nature putteth forth
her flowers, that the lées of wine, are mixed with the wine it
ſelfe, and doe trouble it, and oftentimes corrupt it: and that
as in the excéeding heate of the Sommer Sunne, the more hote
Sulphurus part of the ſame wine, that is, the ſpirit, may and
is woont to vapour away, whereof followeth the corruption
of the ſame wine: euen ſo alſo, about the ſame ſeaſons and times,
the feces, and tartarous heape mixed with our blood, doth at
the laſt peruert, and corrupt it: hereof commeth the occaſion
and multiplication of ſickneſſes. For the ſpirit of blood being
diſprearced and ſeperated, both by external and alſo by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
heate, it muſt needes bée corrupted, to the which corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ariſing of the ſaid cauſes, the cauſe of many ſickneſſes is
rather to be referred, then to thoſe bare ſimple qualities, of hote
and cold, dry and moyſt.</p>
            <p>As therefore we haue taught in the ſeperation of the true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of wine (which reſembleth the celeſtiall and ſpiritual Nectar
of our life) many impurities thereof doe manifeſtly appeare: euen
ſo, and after the very ſame ſort, it fareth with wheate with fruits,
and with meates and drinkes prepared of them, and generally
with all other vegetable things, procéeding after the ſame maner
<pb facs="tcp:10505:93"/>
as we haue ſaid, concerning wine. For they haue no light propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with our blood; according to this ſaying: We are nouriſhed
with thoſe things whereof we conſiſt: which thou maieſt aptly
turne and ſay; we conſiſt of thoſe things, wherewith we are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.
But the one partaketh of the other, or of this or of that
more then of the other: as for example, of the ſpirit, of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
liquor, of Salt, of the feces, &amp; of the ſtinking &amp; vnprofitable
excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: which is the reaſon, that out of this or that more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
kinde of meate, the more worthy and commendable
blood is generated.</p>
            <p>Therefore to adde one example more in ſtéed of a ſurpluſſage
of waight, let it not be forgotten, that out of Hydromel, Cider,
Ale, or ſuch like kind of drinkes, &amp; out of their feces, the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
and ſeperations, as wel of a commendable liquor, as
of feces, may be made after the ſame maner, as we haue before
ſhewed to be done concerning wine: and that the beginnings
and heterogeneall and vnnaturall parts, may in the ſame ſort be
extracted out of theſe, as out of that other.</p>
            <p>To conclude, thou maieſt with better ſucceſſe learne the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of ſickneſſes, by making a compariſon betwéene the
preparation and ſeperation of thoſe things which giue nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vnto man, and our blood, then if according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
maner thou haue recourſe to the humours, &amp; bare qualities, and
ſo to ſéeke out and diſcerne the cauſes &amp; originals of ſickneſſes,
by a certaine witty contemplation, rather then by that which is
more true and infallible.</p>
            <p>Thus we haue thought good to ſet down theſe things by way
of anticipation, concerning the exact, and internal anatomy of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
&amp; concerning alſo the artificiall examining of them: both
that thereby it might appeare from whence the natural impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

            <p>Diſtillations are diuers, according to the diuerſities of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
maners, and of ſubiects: whereupon ariſe ſundry differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of diſtillation. The firſt difference is taken from things, out
of which a moiſture or liquor may be drawne. For after one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Hony: after another, Sulphur: after another Wine: after an
other Waxe: after another Turpentines and Gimmes, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic,
Euphorbum, Styrar, and ſuch like: after another, Salts; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another Hearbs: after another, Rootes: after another many
ſeedes are to be diſtilled.</p>
            <p>The ſecond difference is taken from the diuerſitie of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
diſtilled. For waters, are otherwiſe extracted then are oyles.
As for example, out of Hearbes, Rootes, Flowers and ſeedes,
which are not dry, but growing, waters are extracted by ſimple
diſtillation, without the admixture of any other liquor. But out
of Rootes, Hearbes, Flowers, and ſéedes which are dry and odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferus,
the floating oyles are not extracted, without the meanes
of ſome water or other liquor as a helpe.</p>
            <p>The third difference dependeth vpon the matter and faſhion
of the veſſels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vpon the matter: for one veſſel is of earth, another
of braſſe, another of lead, another of glaſſe.</p>
            <p>Vpon the faſhion alſo: for there is one maner of diſtillation
by an Allembic, another by a Cornut, another by a Matrat, and
another by a Pellican, and ſo of others.</p>
            <p>The fourth difference is by the ſite and placing of the veſſell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10505:101"/>
For if it be by a right Cucurbit, which hath a head with a
pipe or beake, or whether it be inclining or crooked, we call ſuch
diſtillations, by aſcent: or when the neck of one Matrate or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbit,
is put into the neck of another, that is to ſay, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
by concourſe are ſo ioyned together, that one taketh in the
mouth of the other, and the ſame by a diuers poſition: and by
theſe moſt commonly are diſtilled thoſe things which doe hardly
aſcend, and haue ſmall ſtore of iuice.</p>
            <p>Many things alſo are diſtilled by diſcent, that veſſell which
containeth the matter turned the wrong way, and put into the
other, the which manner of working is called by Diſcent, and is
contrary to that which is by Aſcent.</p>
            <p>By Diſcent are diſtilled Ceates, and ſundry kinds of fat wood,
as Giraiacum, Iunipar, and thoſe of roſen ſort.</p>
            <p>The fifth difference is, by the degrees of fire, which are foure:
the firſt, ſecond, third, and fourth.</p>
            <p>The firſt is ſoft and gentle, ſuch is the fire of Balne. <hi>M.</hi> or of
vapour: the ſecond, is of aſhes: the third is of ſand, or of the duſt
of yron that falleth from the Smithes hammer in his worke at
the Stythée. The fourth is of bare fire.</p>
            <p>By the firſt and ſecond degrée of fire, we diſtill by Aſcent: by
the third and fourth, we diſtil by concourſe and Diſcent: Thus
oyles are diſtilled out of Salts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as out of common Salt, out of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
and out of ſuch like.</p>
            <p>But before you begin to diſtil, be ſure that you diſſolue &amp; putrifie.</p>
            <p>But becauſe mention is made before of Digeſtion and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
I will ſhew you plainly, how by theſe two meanes
you may extract out of Roſes a moſt Fragrant water of life, and
ſo excellent, that one droppe thereof, ſhall giue a ſwéete ſent

and then bruiſe or beate them in a ſtone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, or elſe
<pb facs="tcp:10505:102"/>
thou ſhalt put them into a ſmall bonlet of oake, and ſhalt with
diligence preſſe them in with thy hands, in ſuch ſort that the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
may bee ſtuffed ful almoſt to the toppe. Then ſtoppe
and cloſe it vp, that Digeſtion may more eaſily bee made,
and ſet in a wine ſeller by the ſpace of one moneth, or lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
if néede require, vntill thou ſhalt perceiue that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide
matter haue the odour of tart wine: whereby thou
ſhalt knowe that the Fermentation is perfected: and ſo long
it muſt at any hand bee delayed vntill the foreſaide ſigne doe
appeare.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus finiſhed, take to thée the fourth or fifth
part of the Roſes Fermented, according to the greatneſſe of
thy veſſel, which neceſſarily muſt be ſuch as the <hi>Chymicall</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillars
doe vſe wherewith they extract their oyles, and <hi>Aqna-Vitae,</hi>
the which indéede are large, and of Braſſe, rather then of
Lead, furniſhed with their refrigeatories (as they terme them)
which being full of water, the ſpirits made thick through cold are
more eaſily and commodiouſly drawen forth: Taking I ſay, that
portion of Fermented Roſes, diſtill them according to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
maner. That done, ſeperate the feces remayning, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the bottome of the Allembic, and put ſo much of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Roſes aforeſaid into the ſame veſſell, and power vpon
them the water extracted before, diſtilling altogether againe,
vntill there appeare diuers; thy veſſell as well cloſed as may be
as is ſaid afore.</p>
            <p>Gather againe the dryed feces (the which it thou wilt, thou
maieſt reſerue with the former feces) and put the ſame quantity
of the foreſaide Roſes into the Allembic which thou diddeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
vpon which againe thou ſhalt power all the diſtilled water:
And this thou ſhalt doe ſo often vntill thou haſt diſtilled all the
ſaid fermented Roſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe things orderly done, thou ſhalt take all the diſtilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and ſhalt diſtill onely the twelth part thereof, with a gentle
fire in a veſſell with a long neck or Matrate, or in ſuch a one as
<hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> is diſtilled, which is the quantity of all the ſpiritualls
almoſt. As for example, if thou haue twelue pound of water, thou
ſhalt onely extract one pound, which wil be very odoriſerus moſt
<pb facs="tcp:10505:102"/>
ſwéete, and ſpiritual, as ready to take flame, as is that which is
extracted out of wine.</p>
            <p>This water if thou wilt yet make of greater vertue, thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
rectified againe. But the reſt of the water which ſhal remaine
in the bottome of the Allembic, will be more fragrant, and better
then that which is diſtilled after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon maner: whereinto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
thou maiſt conuey his Salt and inſert it, by bringing the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
feces to calcination, &amp; meſhing the ſame oftentimes through
<hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſléene or bagge with water, whereby it ſhal more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
draw vnto it and retaine that Salt. After the ſame maner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
thou maieſt draw waters of life out of violets and other flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and eſpecially out of them which are hote and odoriferus, as
Roſemary, Sage, Betonie: and ſuch other like, which are better
and more effectuall againſt ſickneſſes, then if they be made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the common order. The leaſt quantity hereof will worke
wonderful effects.</p>
            <p>If our Apothecaries would acquaint themſelues with theſe
Concoctions, Fermentations, and Digeſtions, and vnderſtand

nouriſhment. Conſider well the fermentation, by which bread is
made light, and fit for nouriſhment: the lighter it is, the wholſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
it is, and the more it is fermented the lighter it wil be. The
leſſe it is fermented, the heauier it is, and the more vnholſome.
If this preparation goe not before, but that we onely make a

more weake, if ſuch be offered and taken? Surely ſuch as will

            <p>So neceſſarie and profitable is this Fermentation, that
it is very behouefull for an Apothecarie to knowe it: for that
it doth attenuate euery ſubſtance, it looſeneth it from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and terreſtrial impurity, that it may afterwards be made
fit to bring forth the true radical Balſam, and the quickening ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>By the benefite of this onely Fermentation, are extracted

how in holy writ it is ſaid, that a little ſowre Leauen doth fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>By the way of <hi>Fermentation,</hi> which conſiſteth in a certaine
Acetoius liquor of nature, our humours are made thinne and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to excretion. And therefore there are certaine tart things
which moue ſweates, albeit the ſame by the opinion of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are cold.</p>
            <p>Doe wée not ſée that women and ordinary Cookes haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this knowledge of Fermentation: and thereby prouide
for ſicke perſons, Iellyes made of fleſh of foules, and ſuch like, to
reſtore and ſtrengthen them in the time of their weakeneſſe?</p>
            <p>And what are theſe but extracts? For the terreſtrial partes
are ſeperated from the more laudable ſubſtance, which is more
conuenient for the ſicke. And why doe not Apothecaries the like
in compounding their medicines?</p>
            <p>The nature of the ſicke man being now weakened, cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
crude and fulſome meate, but doth rather loathe them, and
is more and more weakened by them. How much more will he
be offended and hurt by medicines not rightly prepared nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
from their impure ſubſtance? Such impuritie muſt néeds
be a great hurt and hindrance, that the natural force of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
cannot encounter with his enemie the ſickneſſe, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we ſay then of thoſe Medicines, which haue not
onely cruditie in them, but alſo ſome euil qualitie, and the ſame
not ſeperated, or rightly prepared: or being corrected, may wée
be bold to giue it? They are woont, (with griefe I ſpeake it) too
much and too often, I ſaythey are woont, I meane ſuch decocted,
pouldred, and mixed Medicines, by no manner of other art pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
to bring more griefe and paine to the ſicke (that I may ſay
no worſe) than ſollace and helpe.</p>
            <p>Therefore theſe kinde of preparations, concoctions, I ſay
Digeſtions, and Fermentations, are not to bée deſpiſed or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
For if theſe things be done, they are done according to
natures faſhion, which vſeth the ſame operations to the perfect
<pb facs="tcp:10505:104"/>
ripening of fruites, and all things the which it bringeth foorth.
But let vs haſten to conclude this Treatize.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his fourth of <hi>Meteors,</hi> hath appointed thrée <hi>Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi>
or kindes of concoction. The firſt he calleth <hi>Pepamſis,</hi> which
is the concoction of humour in moyſt ſéede, made by naturall
heate: And this is the meane of concocting, ripening, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the ſeedes of Plants, and of other things to grow, and
to bring foorth plentie of fruite: and it is a worke onely belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to nature, which vſeth that quickening heate for an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which heate anſwereth the element of Starres in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the ſayd <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith. Albeit Arte cannot immitate
this heate, yet it may tread in the ſteppes thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſecond kinde of concoction, he calleth <hi>Epſeſis,</hi> or <hi>Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
which is a concoction made by a moyſt heate of a thing
indifinitely exiſting in a humour.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt is <hi>Opteſis,</hi> or <hi>Aſſation,</hi> which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of the ſame interminate, made by a dry and ſtraunge
heate.</p>
            <p>Theſe two laſt concoctions, are made eſpecially by Arte, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the moderation of which heates, wée will hereafter
teach the diligent and induſtrious Apethecaries, I ſay induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and ſuch as follow the preſcrips of true Phiſitians and
Arte, not Petlars and Sellers of Trifels, which rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to make retale of Candels, Lanternes, and all Mercerie-wares,
and to fill their ſhoppes with traſh, than to follow the
workes of Art.</p>
            <p>Therefore in ſtéede of liberal perſons, they are miſerable hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings:
Sowters they are, and not Artificers and louers of
Art, Marchants, and handy-crafts men, ſetting their reſt vpon
pompe, pleaſure, and gaine. I had rather ſée an enemie in the
Cittie, then one of theſe baſe minded fellowes. For Citizens
know how to beware of an open enemie: but how can a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the falſhood and treacherie of theſe companions which
they bring to paſſe either by ignorance, or by mallice or elſe by
negligence: I ſay who ſhall take héede of theſe, but he which ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
them quite and cleane out of the Cittie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10505:104"/>
I ſpeake of deceiuers, and ſuch as falſly vſurpe the name
and tittle of Apothecaries, profeſſing that, and yet follow the
Trade of Marchandiſe, and not of honeſt and good men, which
are dilligent in their Arte, to whom this our labour pertaineth,
and to whom theſe our ſtudies and admonions are dedicated, for
the health of many, and for their praiſe and profite.</p>
            <p>The auncient Phyſitians and men of the beſt ſort, delt
more warily and prouided better for themſelues, had this arte
in great honor, and therefore in their owne houſes, they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
medicines with their owne hands.</p>
            <p>And wée alſo for our owne partes would bee loath that
ſome of our ſecrets, ſhould bee caſt before theſe Hogges, and
therefore wée commonly prouide, that they bée prepared in our
Laboratorie at home by a kilfull workeman, whome wée di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and appoint for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Not that wee might make thereby the greater gaine to our
ſelues, but for the honour and praiſe of the Arte, and to our
friends good, the which all thoſe know, that know vs, and haue
receyued the benefite from vs. But for this time theſe ſhall
