            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it needfull to certefie your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip what moued this <hi>Turk</hi> to becom a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: not holie words, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, not the name of faith, but the viewe of fruites, not the learning of Clarks, but the liues of certain good Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whoſe loue &amp; kindnes did ſo rauiſh him (as he ſaide of himſelfe) that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed the God of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be the onely true God. And among others he named Sir <hi>F. Drake</hi> that worſhipful knight, &amp; <hi>W. Haukins</hi> that worthy Captaine. The tree is knowne by the fruits, Gods children are known by their holines, the true profeſſors are knowne by their loue. <hi>Hereby</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>ſhall all men knowe that ye are my diſciples, if ye loue one another.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> gloried they were of God, their behauior declared the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (our ſauiour gaue ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence) to be of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil: they ſaid they were of the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> their works denied them to be ſuch. This is the courſe that Chriſt tooke with the <hi>Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Phariſes</hi> for the ſtay of his credit: <hi>If I do not the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of my Father, beleeue me not. Agayne:
<pb facs="tcp:3999:5"/>
though ye beleeue not me, beleue the works,</hi> This is the rule that <hi>Iewe</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi> that <hi>Turke</hi> &amp; <hi>Saracene,</hi> &amp; euery good Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now marketh &amp; beholdeth, but at this day nothing rifer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, nothing rarer then doing. Wher be the almes-houſes, Hoſpitals, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and Churches nowe a daies founded &amp; builded? No doubt God hath his people, and they haue their fruites, though the ſame be very few. If wee were ſo deſirous to haue our lights (I mean our fruits) ſo ſhine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth in theſe North partes of the world, where Chriſtianitie is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, as we are gredily bent to gette the earthly commodities of <hi>Affrike, Aſia,</hi> and the hid treaſures of the far <hi>Indies,</hi> we ſhoulde no doubt prouoke them out of the ſaid cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries to ſeek after our God, and to bee rauiſhed with the conuerſation and ſteppes of the Chriſtians, as they allure vs wyth fame of their commodities, to ſeeke after their forrain riches. And wheras now one ſilly <hi>Turk</hi> is won, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands no doubt woulde receiue the
<pb facs="tcp:3999:5"/>
faith. The heathens in far cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries do wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der at the couetouſnes of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; the cruelty among other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Spaniard. Presbiter Iohn</hi> in <hi>Affrike</hi> crieth out vpon the Chriſtian Princes for their diuiſion &amp; diſcorde. The great <hi>Turk</hi> at <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantinople</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the pope &amp; his prelats to ſcorn for their pride, the Chriſtian churches he reuileth, and not without cauſe for their idols &amp; images. Reformation is to be ſought for of al men not onely in Religion (wherein ſome ouer-buſie themſelues, neuer ſatiſfied vntill they haue ouerthrowne all) but in liues &amp; maners, that they which are without ſeeing our good workes, may glorifie our father which is in heauen.

The firſt is the trinity, which they denye, acknowledging one God, but denying y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three perſons.

The fifth conſiſteth in the ſaluation of the ſoule. The <hi>Iewes</hi> ſay, that man is to be ſaued by good works, &amp; that God wil rewarde euery man according vnto his works.

There are yet three thinges to bee conſidered in this falſe Religion, which I will briefly runne ouer. Firſt, what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> was the occaſion of the beginning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Diſſention among Prynces, and diuiſion among thoſe that called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Chriſtians. Sathan eſpyed it, and put foorth his Seruaunt <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> to woorke miſchiefe. <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>Choſdroes</hi> Kyng of <hi>Perſia,</hi> were at deadly enmitie, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:3999:34"/>
one againſt the other. The <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Nation fell from them both, and founde <hi>Mahomet</hi> to theyr ringe-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Againe, the Church of GOD was then lamentably diuided. <hi>Peter</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoppe of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> fell into a deteſtable hereſie, ſucked out of the ſchoole of <hi>Valentinus, Marcion,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the Heretikes. <hi>Iacobus Syrus</hi> (of him haue the <hi>Iacobits</hi> in the Eaſt their name) tooke part with <hi>Seuerus:</hi> he held that Chriſt neyther dyed, neyther ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but an other for him, which opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Mahomet</hi> followed. So that the Church was troubled with <hi>Neſtorians Iacobites, Monothelits,</hi> and the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of <hi>Benedicts</hi> order, which then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſwarme like locuſtes vppon the earth. Not onely this, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> beganne to lift vp her ſelfe in pride &amp; abhomination, the Pope calling himſelfe vniuerſall Biſhop. God was highly diſpleaſed with this wickednes, and ſuffered <hi>Mahomet</hi> to riſe as a rod or ſcourge to whippe his people. Wee are nowe to pray that GOD at length
<pb facs="tcp:3999:34"/>
will be reconciled with his people, and that hee will caſt the rodde into the fire. The ſecond thing we haue to conſider, is why this falſe religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is ſo vniuerſally receyued: Carnalitie and fleſhlineſſe is the cauſe.
