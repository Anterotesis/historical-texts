            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I know that my presence for this action will be no small subject of admiration to you all that heare and see me this day, for truelie, I finde it to my self, so that I may justly say with the Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 9.</note> 
               <hi>I am made a spectacle unto the world, and to Angels, and to men.</hi> To the wicked world a spectacle of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and hatred, for quiting it, and taking me to the precious blood of my Saviour Christ, To the good Angels, at the conversion of a sinner: To men,<note place="margin">Luke 15. 7.</note> of compassion and admriation. In you, I perceave


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:504:3"/>
this admiration to be joined with joy and gladnesse, considering the diligent care of your sweet LORD, and loving Master, in bringing home your lost bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the shoulders of His mercie, to His owne sheepfold: in me poore Publican with shame<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 16. Luk. 18. 13. Pfal. 119. 176.</note> and confusion of face, beholding my long suffering God, and you from whom I have gone, alace, too long astray. In you with pitie and compassion, to view me thus cruelly tormented with so many rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wolfes, in me with indignation, for suffering my self to be deceaved so long with these infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall theeves: In you, with praise and thanksgiving, to see me brought home againe alive, in me, with feare and trembling of my Saviours wrath for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and straying so long astray.</p>
            <p>Now to give satisfaction in some measure to your admiration, I will let you understand the cause thereof, that is, my cursed life in Poperie, and how it hath pleased my gratious God to convert me from it, exponing these few words of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Prophet, <hi>Lord be mercifull unto me, heale my</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 42. 4.</note> 
               <hi>soul, for I have sinned against thee.</hi> In which words yee may perceave, that the Prophet having gone astray, touched with remorse of conscience, first he returneth to his God with unfeined repentance, and beggeth pardon for his sins, <hi>Lord be mercifull unto me:</hi> Next, because his soul was deadlie woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he prayeth earnestlie for the health of it, <hi>heal my soul;</hi> And thirdlie, he gives the reason of his petition, <hi>for I have sinned against thee.</hi> In imitation of this mightie King, now turned a humble sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant, I minde, Godwilling, to show you these


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:504:3"/>
things following. 1. How I have wounded my soule, and sinned, by following of Poperie, <hi>I have sinned against thee.</hi> 2. How it hath pleased God of his only mercie to heale my soul in his own time: <hi>Heale my soul</hi> 3. I shall crave pardon first of God, then of my deare Countrey-men, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of you that bee heere present, and of all these who professe with sinceritie the reformed Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods written word, saying, <hi>LORD be mercifull unto me:</hi> 4. And lastlie, I shall answere to some idle objections against this my sincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and heartie resolution.</p>
            <p>Concerning the first point, the words containe foure things worthie of consideration; 1. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that hath sinned, in the word (<hi>I</hi>) 2. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against whom the sin is committed, in the word (<hi>thee</hi>) 3. The sin it self, in the word (<hi>sinned</hi>) and 4. the madnesse of a sinner, to oppose himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goinst so strong a partie as GOD, in the word (<hi>against</hi>) Neither will I insist upon the word (<hi>have</hi>) supponing this confession of the Prophets, and mine to be of bygone sins, whereof remorse of conscience draweth us to a confession; nor minde I to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, exponing the literall, anagogicall, tropolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, or other senses of the words; because I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only to make a relation of my life in Poperie, with an abjuration of the same, and not a preaching, knowing that no man should take that calling upon him, <hi>but he who was called of God, as was Aaron.</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:504:4"/>
thee, which consideration doeth likewise aggravate my sin; for I may say, I who was brought up of honourable parents, with a most religious Minister of Gods word, for the space of six years have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, renouncing that Heavenly doctrine which I learned of them; I who had exponed my life in the wars, to all hazards whereto that calling is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, sundrie years in <hi>Germanie,</hi> for the overthrow of Poperie; was not a year out of the wars, till in my travels passing through <hi>Italie,</hi> I was made a prey in <hi>Florence,</hi> by an <hi>English</hi> Jesuite, called <hi>Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> or <hi>Gerard,</hi> both to his religion and profession. This word may likewise serve for reproof to those who delight more in descriving their neighbours sins, than confessing their owne, forgetfull of our Saviours words, <hi>Judge not; that yee be not judged,</hi>

               <hi>for with what judgement yee judge, yee shall be judged.</hi> And thereafter, <hi>Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beame out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clear lie: to east out the moat out of thy brothers eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second thing considerable heere, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son offended, against whom I have sinned, and this is God Almightie, for against <hi>GOD</hi> are all sinnes which are committed either mediatly or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly; <hi>against thee only have I sinned; and done thïs evill</hi>

               <hi>in thy fight.</hi> The words may serve for confutation and admonition; confutation of the Papists errour, who confesse their sins to earthly men, and not to God, receiving forgivenesse of their Priest. I said (and not to God) whereat I know they will take exceptions, but they need not, for millions of them confesse, who scarcelie know any other God but

the Priest, who hath his stile booke of interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, where to they answere, and thereafter are absolved; moreover, although they know <hi>GOD,</hi> yet I am perswaded, that confessing to the Priest, they confesse not to <hi>GOD,</hi> because <hi>GOD</hi> desires not the Priests help, for he sayeth <hi>Come unto me all ye</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, I must relate the sins themselves which I have committed against this gratious <hi>GOD.</hi> Alace <hi>LORD, I have sinned against thee,</hi> neglecting that precious time of my youth, wherein I imployed more my understanding to learning, then my will to pietie, attending rather to become a good scholler then a good Christian, conferring more with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> and his <hi>followers,</hi> than with <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi> I have sinned by curiositie, exposing my self in forraine Countries, especiallie in <hi>Italie,</hi> to occasions in conference, and disputing with the

I have sinned by wresting of Scriptures, perswading others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that whereof I had no evidence in <hi>GODS</hi> word, <hi>I</hi> have sinned, distilling my braines to finde out meanes, make great journeyes to obtaine them, and

            <p>Fourth, and lastly, the word (<hi>against</hi>) drawes me to a consideration of my madnesse, opposing my self against so strong a partie as God.

O infinite Ocean, and superaboundant treasure of mercie! What shall I say? I poore naughtie worme, yea, dust, opposed my self to that great <hi>GOD</hi> of heaven and earth, by such kinde of grievous sins, and hainous crimes; as idolatrie, taking away of his glorie, spoiling him of his offices, taking upon me his authoritie, by forgiving of sins, and such like; and yet he out of his Fatherly love desisted not to do me good, preserving me from many perils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, both in pest, wars, and travels: roborating my memorie to receave, and keep great diversitie of languages, and strengthning my understanding to learne the experience, and government of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse kingdomes, and Countreys.

            <p>This my Confession and acknowledgement of the mercies of <hi>GOD</hi> towards me, are not done by me to courage others, in the continuance of their sins: For that same <hi>GOD,</hi> who out of his free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, spared me for a time, he destroyed with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Euseb.</note> from heaven that tyrannous apostate <hi>Julian</hi> in the heat of his sin, crying out with despare, <hi>Thou hast overcome O Gililean:</hi> and suffered <hi>Judas</hi> to enter into desperation, at the sight of the greatnesse of<note place="margin">Matth. 27. and 5.</note> his sin, and cut off his miserable life with his own hands.

            <p>That worthie Doctor <hi>Austine</hi> sayeth, <hi>Humanum est peccare, Diabolicum perseverare, &amp; Angelicum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surgere:</hi> It is a humane thing to fall in sin, a devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish to persevere therein, and an angelick, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, to rise from it. Therefore, having in the


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:504:7"/>
first point of this discourse showne you, how it hath pleased God to suffer me to fall by humane fragilitie, and devilish perseverance in that monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sin of Poperie: In this second I will, Godwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, let you understand, how it hath pleased God to raise me up, from that Lithargie of superstitious idolatrie, and heale my soul wounded with Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which was the second thing proponed by mee in the beginning.</p>
            <p>Upon these words, <hi>Heale my soule,</hi> I might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiat my self, and amplifie this discourse largely, with two considerations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First, inquiring wherein consisteth the health and perfection of mans poore wounded soule; and secondly, considering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and properties of the soule which is healed, touching the first, I might have to doe with three sorts of persons, <hi>morale Philosophers, scholastick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> and <hi>erroneous Papists.</hi> Showing the first, that the perfection, health, and happinesse of our soul doth not consist in worldly pleasures, riches, sensuall lusts, carnall concupiscences, adoption of morall vertues, speculation, or contemplation of Gods cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, or in the dominion of the soule of man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his owne passions, as many of them have had these severall opinions.</p>
            <p>Discoursing with the second, and trying, whether or not that eternall felicitie, and happinesse of our soules, doeth consist in the actions of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or of the will, or of both, and in what kinde: And refuting the third in four points; first, Letting them see their errour, when they imploy their Saints at <hi>Rome, Loret, Galatia,</hi> and where they


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:504:8"/>
think expedient for health to their soule, besides Christ, or betweene them and Christ: 2. Showing them, that the Sacrament of Baptisme is not so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute a salve, but it leaveth behinde it the root and seed of sin, <hi>fomitem peccati.</hi> 3. Demonstrating to them, that mans good works, although they be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens or symptomes, yet are they not the cure and salve of the health of mans poore wounded soule: And 4. That, that true meane of the health of our soule, <hi>Repentance,</hi> is not to be defiled by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confession, and execrable satisfaction, but is to be understood of a broken and contrite heart, applying by faith the deare merits of that precious blood of Jesus Christ, to our poore wounded souls. But all these points of doctrine, with their severall spirituall observations and uses, I remit to an other time and place, giving them <hi>Augustines</hi> resolution for all their questions, <hi>Creasti nos Domine propter</hi>

            <p>And therein I finde two things to be remarked, the time, and the causes of this my restored health. As for the first, it is evidently known, that the Lord hath his owne time in calling of soules, <hi>Calling</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:504:10"/>
remarks of <hi>Paul,</hi> to wit that God did call him being a <hi>persecuter,</hi> brought up among the learned at <hi>Gamaliels</hi> fleet, knowing all their plots and conspiracies against Gods elect, he might better being converted give antidots again their poyson; for it he had done so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much out of blinde zeile, for the defence of <hi>his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> 
               <hi>traditions, much more would he for the true service of GOD,</hi> wish that he were <hi>an accursed from Christ for his brethren.</hi> Even so thinke I truelie that my deare Saviour have dealt with me, not calling me when I entred to their errours, nor when I was drinking in their pernicious doctrine, neither when I was imployed to worke the mysterie of iniquitie against the true Church of God: but when I had learned all their tricks, plots, conspiracies, devices, and inventions, for the extirpation of Gods true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that being brought up at <hi>Vrbanus</hi> feet, and knowing their malice, I might the better with Gods grace provide remedics against their pernicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes; and as I had taken great paines for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieving of their malitious ends, much more should I labour now in Christs vineyeard, for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Christs mysticall body <hi>the Church.</hi> The<note place="margin">Col. 1. 24.</note> Lord of his infinite mercie grant me his favourable assistance, and powerfull grace thereto.</p>
            <p>The second thing that I proposed, was, the causes of the health of my Soul; and these are four, mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, formall, finall, and efficient; the first is the soul it self taken specificative, the second is the same soul taken reduplicative, <hi>ut sanata, as healed;</hi> the third or finall, is that eternall joy and felicitie, for the which before time God hath elected, and in

               <hi>nor eare heard, neither hath entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> The fourth and last is threefold, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, meritorious, and instrumentall. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall efficient cause of the health of my soul was the blessed and holy Trinitie, it being an action <hi>ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> and all such are common to the three persons of the Trinitie, as Divines teach.

            <p>I might (and minde Godwilling heereafter) demonstrate, that all the contraversies betweene papists and us, may bee easily brought to these foure monstruous heads of poperie, but for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I will only indicat some few; Their transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation is grounded upon that Logicall treatise of the Quantitie, where they destroy the nature of

quantitie, to build their breadie god, their justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works, and their free will are built upon that physicall question of Gods concourse with the second causes in <hi>Aristotles</hi> treatise of the efficient cause. That high question of predestination, upon the foreknowledge of good works, standeth upon the decision of that Logicall question, <hi>de futuris contingentibus,</hi> of contingent things to come; their fundamentall ground of all papistrie, the popes hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie is built upon <hi>Aristotles</hi> politicks, and taught in the Jesuits morall philosophie.

And as for their philosophie, for by that which I have above-mentioned, their owne great pillar <hi>Albertin,</hi> a Jesuite, hath set out three volumes <hi>in folio,</hi> where he showeth all their scholastick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, and controversies of religion to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the principles of humane philosophie.

in his holy word, adjoining my self to the true reformed Church of God, in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Whereof if any man aske the reason of adjoining my selfe to the Church of God in <hi>Scotland,</hi> rather then to another church, as <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Germanie:</hi> I answere them, that I minde to use a part of the Physitians counsell, who give for a singular antidote, against the pest of the body three things to observe, that is, <hi>citò, longè, tardè;</hi> which is somuch, as whosoever will bee free of the bodily pest, let him go soone away from the place infected, next go far away; and thirdly, to stay long away, that the place be well cleansed before he returne: so say I, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be free of that spirituall pest of Antichrist let him use three things, <hi>citò, longè nunquam,</hi> that is, let him go soone away from it, next far away; and thirdly never to return back againe to it: And because the Church of God in <hi>Scotland</hi> observeth best this infallible rule of any of them all, being far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest from all popish superstition, and neerest to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall puritie, therefore I have adhered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and not to any of the rest. And because read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture was the occasion, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>cause of this my recovered health; I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, by the tender mercies of Christ, that every man take some paines every day to read a portion of Scripture; especially yee blinded papists, to whom it is a mortall sin to read it, more than the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, except yee have a dispensation, for both are alike forbidden, read the Scriptures often, and yee shall surely finde comfort to your souls, so that yee read them with prayer and humilitie, and not

            </p>
            <p>An other reason which did confirme me in this my godly resolution, was, I could finde no warrand in Scripture for poperie; and yet I preased to strain the Scripture, and throw it to my purpose, but could never satisfie mine owne conscience: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that fundamentall point of their tyrannous hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie, of <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> by what right the popes serve themselves heire to <hi>Peter,</hi> more than the Churches of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which are more ancient Churches then that of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> succession is tyed to the towne of <hi>Rome, jure divino,</hi> as I was taught by them, that of the popes infallibilitie, notwithstanding their contradictions one to another in fundamentall things, his usurped authoritie upon Gods Scriptures, and mens consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and all their traditionall trash, have no true warrand in Gods word: Yea, I wonder that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, who know this silence of their opinions in Gods word, should remaine in <hi>Babylon</hi> any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for we are commanded to <hi>search the Scriptures,</hi>

               <hi>a conscience void of offence towards GOD, and towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I speak nothing of their brutish and Sodomitish life, worse then that of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> described by the Apostle, which although it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be not universall tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all the popes dominions; yet it is common and notorious in the privie chamber (that is <hi>Italie</hi>) of that <hi>Babylonish</hi> whoore, as is known to the world by relation, and to me by auricular confession. Neither touch I that superstitious and hypocriticall life in publick of their ghostly Fathers, and their odious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious lives in their private cloisters and chambers.</p>
            <p>I know my old fellowes, the <hi>Jesuits</hi> will exime themselves from this my censure, casting it upon the bellygod friers, pretending puritie from such things in themselves; but let a judicious man consider their day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good entertainment, weekly feasts in their houses of pleasure in the fields, and their frequent banquets upon their saincts dayes thorow the year, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their wines; that they are young, noble, and gentle, quick witted youths for the most part, having thereafter great notice of sins by auricular confessions and almost hourely familiar conference with women of all conditions, both publickly and privately, and then judge what they are, or what they may bee.</p>
            <p>The third point which I proponed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was to crave pardon of these my rehearsed er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. <hi>What then shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will take the cup of salvation, and</hi>

            <p>Fourth and lastly, against thus my sincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and cordiall resolution, there bee three sorts of persons who oppose themselves, <hi>some friends, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies some, and some adiaphorists.</hi> The first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede out of love and zeale, the second out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and rage; the third out of policie and crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

to every one of these three classes must I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, before <hi>I</hi> closse this my abjuration.</p>
            <p>The first sort then may say, that it is heard to believe, than I, who was so fullie possessed with poperie, can be truely converted in my heart, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so many allurements and occasions of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to continue slave to the purpurat whoore, and therefore it were good to try me, before I be trusted.</p>
            <p>My answere is first, that I had many snares to hold me fast in poperie; one was that I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by their tyrannous Lawes, to reject and cast away any doubt that came unto my minde against the <hi>Romish</hi> profession, under no lesse paine than mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sin, and eternall condemnation, no lesse than the thoughts of murther, treason, filthinesse, leacherie, &amp;c. Where it is to be remarked that the Turks do only forbid hearing, or disputing of any other religion but their own, under the paine of death, which they and we thinke very heard; but these <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> are much worse, condemning both body and soul to hell eternally, for a thought only against their profession; This snare is the strongest wall of Poperie: Another snare is, that which intangleth the Doctors and learned men, who examining the doctrine of their church, and finding their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence touched with the evidencie and trueth of Gods word, resolve that these tentations proceed of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their understanding; and therefore conclude, seeing their church can not (as they alleadge) erre that the resolution of the church is only true, and Gods true light inspired in them, but only tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:504:16"/>
of Sathan, and so preoccupied with a prejudged minde, continue in their errour, This is the second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall of that babylonish tower, I speak nothing of riches, and pleasure, contentment of minde for worldly things, for it is knowne that the Jesuits (whereof I was one) have the most contented life in this world of any men whosoever, and therefore if <hi>I</hi> had looked to my particular commodities more than to the light of Gods word, and my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science which did presse me, I had never come out of poperie.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, I answere, that it is no wonder if they do not give me full trust as yet, because <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 9. 15.</note> after his conversion, although he was <hi>a chosen ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to beare Christs name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of Israel,</hi> was not trusted in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, yea, neither did <hi>Ananias</hi> believe Christs<note place="margin">Act. 9. 12.</note> own testimonie of him; <hi>then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evill he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem.</hi> What reason then should they have to trust me poore sinner, a stranger in a manner to them, untill they try me: In the meane time <hi>I</hi> request these my friends to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend their judgements for a time, seeing <hi>exitus acta probat,</hi> the event prooves the deeds, And take<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 20</note> Christs way a tryall, <hi>by their fruits yee shall know them:</hi> And pray for me, that as I was a persecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> so I may bee a preaching <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second, my deadlie enemies for rage and despight that I have left them, will (I know) spew out all the venemous poyson that malicious hearts can invent, especiallie that I have not left the Jesuits,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:504:17"/>
but that for my odious and detestable life I have beene cast out from among them.</p>
            <p>To these I answere, first, that <hi>benifaciend<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem timeo, doing well I am feared for no man:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, their evill speeches and misreports, are an evident token, that Christ my loving master favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, giving me occasion (although innocent) to suffer calumnies as he did; he was both God and Man, and yet he was said <hi>to cast out Devils in Beelzebubs name. And that he had a devill. That he</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 24. Ioh. 8. 48.</note> 
               <hi>was a eater and drinker and keeper of companie with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanes and sinners;</hi> What then should I expect, poor sinfull wretch, from viperous tongues, but all what hell can devise against me? Thirdlie, I answere, that they wrong themselves much more than me, objecting thus, for either they must make me vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and casten out before I came into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or when I was in it or else since I went out of the countrey. Not the first, because it were great imputation to their own order, to send vitious men to be Apostles (as they call them) and convert souls amongst their enemies, who could, and would spy all their actions. Moreover, it is known by all these who know them, that the first thing they looke for in a missioner (such as I was) is a godly life and conversation, otherwise the Generall doeth not give them their Letters patent; which I receaved, and did let not only them, but many others in <hi>Scotland,</hi> see; neither without it had <hi>I</hi> beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved and imployed by the superiour in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> was; which he cannot deny, so many of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, both, in and out of <hi>Scotland</hi> knowing it.


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:504:17"/>
Secondly, for the time that I was in the countrey, concerning my life and conversation, <hi>I</hi> submit my self to the censure of these, both Protestants and Papists, with whom <hi>I</hi> lived at that time, and to the Letters which the Superiour receaved in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from the noble man with whom <hi>I</hi> lived; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suppose <hi>I</hi> had beene vitious, could the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in <hi>Scotland,</hi> cast me out of his order, for as the reception into their order, is proper actions to their Generall; so likewise is the dismission, for he only can absolve from their vowes these that are dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Moreover, if <hi>I</hi> had beene such as <hi>I</hi> know out of malice they will call me, they had surely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished me as their custome is; but before my God <hi>I</hi> say it, <hi>I</hi> was never reproved of the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; or any other, all the time <hi>I</hi> was in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but for going to the churches, in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and exposing my self and them to danger, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing openlie thorow the countrie.</p>
            <p>Finallie, if they had cast me out, they had not entertained me so kindlie at my departure out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as they did, for then the Superiour gave me Letters to go for <hi>Doway,</hi> and there teach the youths of the College their controversies, and heare their confessions, moneyes to carrie me there, and three of his Jesuits after kinde entertainment in this Town convoyed me a myle off my journey: These all were signes of love, and not of outcasting from their Societie, and they and <hi>I</hi> know them to be of veritie: Wherefore I remit all to God, let Him be Judge betwixt mee and them. As for their misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, I care no more for them than for the winde


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:504:18"/>
that bloweth, <hi>I</hi> being known both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and abroad, as well as any of them, both great and small. Thirdly, since I went out of <hi>Scotland</hi> last, they could not cast me out of their order, because since, I was never in any house of theirs, nor keeped companie with them; And as for my life and conversation ever since, I am sorrie, it was not so good as became a reformed Christian; yet whatsoever it was, they had nothing to doe with it; and there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthie Cavaliers, both at home and abroad, in whose companie <hi>I</hi> have lived this time bygone, who know that my life was neither scandalous to my profession, shamefull to my Nation, or any wayes disgracefull to my particular calling of a Souldiour.</p>
            <p>The third sort that is adiaphorists, or <hi>CONE</hi>-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, out of their craftinesse and policie, say, that they know not what to judge of me, for charitie urgeth them to believe me, and prudencie forceth them to beware of me; and there they stand in doubt, as that father whom they paint betweene <hi>Christ</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists paint Austen.</note> and <hi>Marie,</hi> knew not what side to turn himself <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o, <hi>Positus in medio, quò me vertam nescio; hinc pascor à vulnere hinc lactor ab ubere. On the one side I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christs wounds, on the other Maries paps; heere I am nourished with the milk of a virgine, there I am fed with the bloud of a Saviour.</hi> Charitie bids them <hi>judge not, and they shall not be judged;</hi> Prudencie commands them not to trust before they try. All this is good, but what tryall can they bring in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mee? Have they any thing to object or say against this my resolution and declaration? Yes, say they, because in respect of the extreme policie


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:504:18"/>
of Jesuits, it may be that out of policie I have beene sent out by them, to the end <hi>I</hi> may set <hi>Reformists</hi> and <hi>CONE-formists</hi> by the ears together, whereby the Papists and Jesuits may the more easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come both, and I received in againe with them, may be thought to have done great service to the church of <hi>Rome:</hi> The reason which moveth them to judge thus is, because (say they) these who are converted, and come out of the <hi>Romish</hi> church, use commonly to take them to a church, which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to draw Protestants and papists to a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, selecting out the best of both; because not in extremitie, but in mediocritie consisteth vertue.</p>
            <p>This discourse formed by a not reformed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of this Town, and related to me by a sufficient Gentleman, to whom it was spoken, containeth three things in it: 1. The Jesuits policie, whom they su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect might have sent me out: 2. The end of my out-coming, that is, to stir up dissention betweene <hi>Reformists</hi> and <hi>CONE-formists:</hi> And thirdly, a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of my adjoining my self rather to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> than to that of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Germanie.</hi> These bee their politick arguments, to which I must answere, and then finish this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>To the first then I answer, that I have touched something alreadie of the Jesuits policie, in sending out their sect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mates like grashoppers through the world; And now <hi>I</hi> answer againe, that these who argue thus, know not the Jesuits policie well; for surely they never send out any of policie, to detect their owne policie, neither doeth their policie reach


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:504:19"/>
that far, as to permit and dispense with these whom they send out, to renounce and abjure the Romish doctrine, and professe the direct opposite thereto, as <hi>I</hi> have done. It is true, that they have dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation among Protestants, to live as Protestants; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Lutherians, Arrians, Henricians,</hi> and the like, as they do, for life and conversation that they may seduce them, but not for their doctrine. They ground this forme of dissimulation upon the words of the Apostle, <hi>I am made all things to all men, that</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 22</note> 
               <hi>by all meanes I might save some:</hi> A specious pretext indeed, which blinds the eyes of many poore souls; but if they would look neerer, they could easily discover the nakednesse of it, and see clearly they pretend one thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and intend another: Wherefore (I pray you) doe the Jesuits flocke so thicke to <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> that new <hi>Spanish</hi> treasure, but not so to <hi>Scythia</hi> or <hi>Tartarie</hi> and <hi>Volinia,</hi> to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> in droves, to <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> but scattered ones; to great townes where they onlie dwell, and not to dorps and villages where ignorance abounds? The reason is, that they pretend zeale, and intend gold; they pretend to gaine soules, and intend to gaine riches. It is true, they are cunning tradsmen, and can worke well according to their owne wayes, but they must have a good fat Subject to worke upon; and this for the Jesuits policie. The second shall bee answered after the third.</p>
            <p>To the third then I have likewise answered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and now answere againe; First, because I finde the reformed Church of GOD in <hi>Scotland</hi>


               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:504:19"/>
to bee furthest from Popish idolatrie, and neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to Apostolicall puritie. Secondlie, because that <hi>I</hi> was never, am not, neither ever (God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing) shall bee a <hi>lukewarme Laodicean;</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<note place="margin">Rev. 8. 16.</note> seeing that my Saviour Jesus Christ promiseth, <hi>To him that overcommeth, will I grant to sit with</hi>

               <hi>mee in my Throne, even as I also overcame, and am set downe with my Father in His Throne.</hi> What madnesse (<hi>I</hi> pray you) were it in a Mariner, for to come out of a sunken ship, to enter into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other which is sinking, and may have a tight one? In a prisoner relieved out of a low pit, to cast himselfe into free ward, having his libertie in his option? In a sensible man fled from a pestiferous towne, to reteere himselfe to another where the same sicknesse hath taken encrease, when hee may have with great ease a palace of pleasure, voide of all kinde of suspicion of any infection what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever? None truely (<hi>I</hi> thinke) would bee so madde, and destitute of judgement, but he, who going out of this valley of miserie, to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mansions, would stay, and take in purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for his winter quarters.</p>
            <p>Yet they say, that it were well done to conforme to a middle religion between Protestants and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, because extremeties are to be avoided, and mediocritie embraced, To these I answere, that if they had studied their Logick as well as their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, they had known, that of the four logicall, oppositions, there is one called <hi>Contradictoria,</hi> which will admit no middes, <hi>Inter propositiones contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:504:20"/>
between us and <hi>Rome,</hi> they say that we are he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, we deny it, they can not prove it, seeing we believe the Scriptures <hi>which are given by divine iuspiration, and are able to make the man of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unto all good workes.</hi> We say that the Pope is Antichrist, they deny it, but we can prove it, out of the prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> the Apostles <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and so foorth in all the rest of controversies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and us, so that there can be no composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no more than betwixt light and darknesse, God and <hi>Beliall;</hi> For Christ saith plainlie, <hi>He that is not with me, is against me, and he that gathereth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 12. 30.</note> 
               <hi>not with me, scattereth abroad.</hi> Therefore there is no mediocritie heere. And the reason of this is, because as the Apostle averreth, there is but <hi>One</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 5</note> 
               <hi>Faith,</hi> in respect of its formall object, Gods writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, the authoritie whereof is from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, God himself and so is divine, and what is contradictorie to it, is not divine, nor to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to salvation: And therefore no meeting nor trysting with <hi>Rome.</hi> If it be said that the Papists believe many points common with us, as the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, Incarnation, &amp;c. and therefore that they must have faith, and so faith will not be indivisible: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that they have a materiall faith, as <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jewes</hi> likewise have, but not a formall faith; which depending upon the authoritie of God, revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in his word only; and no other faith can be profitable for salvation.</p>
            <p>The second branch of this politick objection is, their doubt of my out coming from <hi>Rome,</hi> to wit, that it was to stir up diffension betwixt. <hi>Reformists</hi>


               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:504:20"/>
and <hi>CONE</hi>-formists, for the Papists and Jesuits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, To these I answere, first, that their Critick spirits proceed more out of Philosophicall, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall, than out of Christian or Thologicall grounds, in this their censure of my sincere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; Philosophie teacheth them that, <hi>Quic quid reciptur, ad modum recipientis recipitur, whatsoever is receaved, it is receaved according to the measure of the receaver?</hi> And Mathematicians in their Opticks teach that the visible speces passing from the object to the organe which receaveth them, take upon them the colour of the mids where through they passe, which daylie experience confirmeth; and therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their dispositions and affections they judge of me, as their passions transport them, but not as Christian charitie exhorteth them, for the Scripture teacheth that it is <hi>Christ that justifieth, who</hi>

               <hi>is he that condemneth.</hi> Secondlie, I answere, that as God is my witnesse, they wrong me pitifully, for, as the Lord knoweth, I desire <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme,</hi> not only in <hi>Britaine,</hi> but likewise tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the whole world, and that we think alwayes the same, <hi>till we all come in the unitie of faith, and</hi>

you: And that it may be seene that I am not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, I speake to all the three Kingdomes of <hi>Scotland, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> minding to show you all three that Papists ly in wait to deceave you by two meanes, seminaries, and pensions; yet it is first to be remarked that the ground of both is that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in <hi>Rome,</hi> called, <hi>Congregatio de propaganda,</hi> or rather <hi>extirpanda fide, a congregation of propagating</hi> (or rather) <hi>extirpating of Faith.</hi> This Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath a most sumptuous Palace in <hi>Rome,</hi> and extreme rich; the members of it, are the Pope, as head of the Church, his nephew Cardinall, <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Barbarine</hi> as his Lieutennant, diverse others Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, the Generals of severall Orders, the great Master of the inquisition, and some Doctors all as judges; they conveene every fryday, or ofter as they please, the end of their meetings is to finde out meanes to bring all people and Nations under the popes dominion, for thus end they have sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry meanes, such as their Seminaries of diverse na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their pensions. The Semenaries are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with youths out of their severall Countries, by Jesuits, who have the care of them; These youths are of two sorts, the one called <hi>Convictores,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they pay for their entertainment, and these are Noble, Barons, and Gentlemen Sons, sent thither by their popish parents, to be brought up for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse ends: The other are called <hi>Seminarists,</hi> and these have their food, raiment, studies, books, &amp;c. all the time of their studies out of these colleges; with condition, that after they have stayed three moneths in one of these Colleges, they must make


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:504:21"/>
a vow to take priesthood upon them, and to returne to their severall Countries, when they shall be found fit, by the Jesuits their Masters; to the end they may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce others as they were seduced themselves; And therefore after their studies, they are sent into the countrie, furnished with all things necessarie, as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, moneyes, masse-graith, and the like, as they are thought of, and have moyen at Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of their semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, there be five of our nation out of the countrie, at <hi>Rome, Paris, Madrid, Doway,</hi> and <hi>Brounsberg;</hi> and one promised by the Emperour in <hi>Osnabruck,</hi> which the <hi>Swedens</hi> keepe for them; of <hi>Irish</hi> some, and many and great of <hi>English.</hi> These Seminarists Jesuits, and other Priests, send their relation every year of all what passe in the countrie, spirituall or temporall, to the foresaid congregation, wherein all treasons, massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, and other bloudie mischiefs are hatched, as the the histories of <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> can testifie.</p>
            <p>This presupposed as an assured truth, I spake first to thee <hi>Scotland,</hi> my dear countrie, that thou wrongest thy self mightily, to suffer these scismes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions in thee, which are now with great pitie to bee seene, and shame to be heard: That every one of you saith, <hi>I am of Paul, and I of Apollo, &amp;c.

            <p>But some will say, that there be great doctors not Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters, and wherefore may they not likewise stand out as well as these learned men. I answer first, that they are but few, and to my judgement (for <hi>I</hi> have discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with some of them) not the learnedest of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, brought up in a town which was never yet cleansed from poperie, and where I have seene an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth at Masse in one time within this few yeeres: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, these Doctors suppose they be both good and learned, (as I know some of them are) shall not answer for thee in that great day, <hi>wherein there shall be had no respect of persons;</hi> for assure thy self, that <hi>Anima quae peccaverit, ipsa punietur, The soul that sinneth, it shall be</hi>

Andrewes, Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deene, Glasgow, and other parts, to give a reason of their faith; and among other, these of Aberdeene tooke upon them to dispute with John Knox, John Willock, and M. Goodman.</hi> Neither is it to be thought, that the historian a stranger, wrote any thing out of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie in this point against that town, more as against

            <p>My counsell now to you that are Covenanters, is,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10 12.</note> that, <hi>Qui stat, videat ne cadat, Let him that thinke hee standeth, take heed least he fall;</hi> for the crown of glory is only for him that overcometh, <hi>Qui perseveraverit usque in finem, hic salvus erit, He that shall endure to the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mac. 24.</note> 
               <hi>end, the same shall be saved.</hi> Yeeld not in a word, a syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lab, a jote, least thou scandalize thy weak brother, and give occasion to <hi>Rome</hi> to stand and expect thy returne, she not so much as beginning a motion towards thee: For they seeing your novations of <hi>Bishops, Deanes, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, kneeling at Sacrament, crosse in Baptisme,</hi> and the rest of these articles, were in assured confidence, that yee were turning to them againe, and used common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to say, <hi>See so faine as they are to creep in to us again,</hi> which did confirme all our people, and made sundrie of yours to follow us. If these points, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by the most part were thought allowable, did so much harm to Gods church, what their English masse, canonicall inquisition, and the rest of that, almost bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, trash had done, if they had not beene preveened by that Al-seeing God, judge yee. And finally, grant thou nothing that <hi>Rome</hi> desireth of thee, for it hath no warrand from God, and thou knowest no conformitie to be admitted <hi>betweene God and Dagon; hold fast</hi> then<note place="margin">1 Sam. 5 Rev. 3. 11 13.</note> 
               <hi>that which thou hast least another take thy crown from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to you not Covenanters I say, that of your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <hi>I</hi> never saw any but one; neither would I mourn, albeit <hi>I</hi> never saw more of them in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and I am their friend or enemie, as they are Christs: yea, more I say, if yee knew as vvell as they and I know; even


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:504:23"/>
the draughts that are drawn against you, the strength and policie of your enemies without, and your inward enemies, against this poor church of God, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly perswaded that yee would all subscribe that worthie Covenant, before that yee went out of this Church, or else <hi>I</hi> would hold you as internall papists; for there bee both internall and externall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> perceive you all curious to demand me a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if modestie could permit you to speak, to wit, what is this that I know more than other men, let us (say ye) understand it, and we will yeeld to reason.</p>
            <p>To this lawfull question <hi>I</hi> answer, that <hi>I</hi> know more than any Protestant in <hi>Scotland</hi> of this businesse; for <hi>I</hi> was imployed in it, the year of God 1632. and gave in (among other points of my commission) a petition to the foresaid Congregation at <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and else where, desiring them to advise upon the meanes, for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> diverse were proponed by these politick heads, who studie only to destroy Kings and pervert kingdomes; of many, these few were most considerable: First, that they should all imploy their wits for the perversion of his Majestie, our Soveraigne Lord, and contribute for the levying of an armie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of giving assistance to some confederate Prince, and therewith to force libertie of conscience: This opinion was rejected as dangerous, till all things were surer, and their faction stronger: 2. That if they could not attaine to their purpose with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, they should endeavour to get two Jesuits in our Prince his service, for his Graces instruction, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in poperie: 3. That pensions should be given by mediate wayes, through the Vniversities, and other


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:504:23"/>
parts where they might work their ends: 4. Yet this was all thought little of, by one of our Countriemen, who advised them to set their whole mindes for the perversion of <hi>England;</hi> which being neerer to them in points of doctrine, forme of service, worship, and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall government, they might work surer, and with greater hope of prevailing, then with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triemen, whom he assured to be of a stubborn nature, dangerous to be dealt with, and great Puritans, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly opposite to the church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And therefore nothing more should be desired of them, but confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie in matters of religion with <hi>England,</hi> which the <hi>English</hi> church would gladly wish, as if she were a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther church whereof others did flow; neither could his Countriemen deny it, in respect of his Majesties Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, and of the union of the two Crowns and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, that they both might have but <hi>one Lord, one faith, one baptisme,</hi> &amp; one King. For the execution of his counsell, he proponed mutuall intelligence to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> which shortly after was begun by an <hi>Italian</hi> priest, a great politician, well versed in the <hi>French</hi> tongue, called <hi>Il Signor Gregorio,</hi> who stayed more as an year and an half in <hi>London</hi> for that effect, and with whom <hi>I</hi> conferred in his owne ludging, in the <hi>Convent garden</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and with two great men of our nation, and now continueth there himself, with great grudge to both the kingdomes, seeing this mutuall intelligence was never heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Rome</hi> and us, since the Cardinals <hi>Wolsey</hi> and <hi>Polus</hi> dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither is it necessarie, as Statesmen may see. Now, not Covenanter, is thy curiositie satisfied? This I know, and more, looke thou to it in time; and bee


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:504:24"/>
not one of these, who for vanitie or other ends vvill bee thought singulare against Gods cause, and thy ovvne promise in baptisme.</p>
            <p>And I will end this discourse, that my enemies say not that I minde to put dissension betwixt <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>CONE-formists,</hi> letting our neighbours <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> see some of the dangers wherein they stand of that <hi>Romane antichrist,</hi> and his congregation <hi>de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpanda fide.</hi> First then, yee stand both in danger as well as we, of these our related dangers; especially of that mutuall intelligence between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> 2. Of your Countrie mens affection to <hi>Rome,</hi> if they be papists, for alleadged rights of the popes upon you both, the one called <hi>Peters pennie,</hi> the other called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters patrimonie.</hi> 3. Your extreame great number of Jesuits and other Priests, extending in <hi>England</hi> to five or six thousand, so that they are striving among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and writing books against other (which I my self carried to <hi>Rome</hi>) for Bishopricks in your Church. As for <hi>Ireland</hi> it hath fifteene papists bishops alone. This is a great danger. 4. Your populous multitude of Papists in you both, extending to many thousands, so that I am of that minde, that in <hi>England</hi> the people (if not alreadie) may shortlie desire a Generall Assemblie, for libertie of conscience. 5. The education of your Nobilitie at schooles in forraine countries, who having drunke in the doctrine of iniquitie from their tender age, are both more perverse in themselves, and more dangerous, bringing in their friends and neighbours, by their Priests to perdition with them. 6. That which is to be lamented of all, that you have good lawes, both of you, against Papists, and very good reason to


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:504:24"/>
execute them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alace, money break them, granting to all Papists a pecuniall libertie of conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and present banishment to all these poore reformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who will not conforme with you, and that which is to be laughen, or rather weeped at, that yee would blinde peoples eyes with your searchers, going on the one side to apprehend priests, and punish pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists; and on the other side; to have your customers to receave moneyes, and give discharges for libertie of papistrie, O God! who doth not evidentlie perceave these monstruous dangers, and not oppose himself with all his power to them, if there remaine but a sponk of true Christianitie in him? Truelie, who doth it not, I must of necessitie think him an internall papist.</p>
            <p>The last danger of all the three kingdomes is <hi>Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> whereof we may consider four things. 1. The giver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. The persons to whom they are given. 3. The quantitie of the summes. 4. And the end wherefore they are given. There is certainlie pensions given in the Countrie, for priests and intelligencers, and out of the Countrie, for Semenaries and correspondents of these intelligencers; but to come to the particulars. 1. The givers are the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the foresaid Congregation, <hi>de extirpanda fide.</hi> 2. The persons to whom it is given in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to my knowledge are the Priests (whereof <hi>I</hi> vvas one) the man that goeth for it, and the thesaurer or keeper, I knovv the names and residences of the rest; and had set them dovvn heere, if I had not declared them sufficiently by vvrit alreadie: And if there be given pensions to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other as to these, the superiour vvith his counsellours and the Treasurer knovv it, for me <hi>I</hi> knovv not; but


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:504:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this <hi>I</hi> am assured of, that there was more sent into the country, than was bestowed upon the foresaid persons. 3 The quantitie <hi>in cumulo</hi> is best known to them, I being none of the Superiours counsellours, in respect of my travels for the mission, the quantitie that we who were Priests gote, was an hundred crowns in the yeer from <hi>Rome,</hi> and eighteene pence every day from <hi>Spaine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides our purchase by our <hi>Masses, Confessions,</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> which was more or lesse, conforme to out imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the persons with whom we dealt. 4. Lastly, in a word the end of these gifts is pretended zeal and piety, but truely intended <hi>Hierarchie of Rome, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of Spaine,</hi> which may appear by the depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of M. <hi>George Ker,</hi> and the Jesuits <hi>Abercrumbie, Crigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and <hi>Gordoun,</hi> with three Noblemens letters inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with him, and registrat in this town, the year of God 1592. by his pensions given to us, and his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rights over our native countries. If this be not an evident danger to suffer so many forraine Princes pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners in your bosome, God see to it in his own time; and give me grace that I may follow my sincere and heartie resolution, that at the houre of my death, <hi>I</hi> may say wirh the Apostle, <hi>I have fought a good fight; I have</hi>
