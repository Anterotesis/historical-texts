         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true <hi>COPIE</hi> of a Paper delivered by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> to ſome of his Servantes, at <hi>St James</hi> that morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſuffred, in the preſence of <hi>Doctor Sibbald.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Know you that are here, to be true, and faithfull to me, I will therefore in your hearing, ſay ſome what in order to my ſelfe, and to my preſent Condition, and giue you alſo this Copie of it, which after I am gone may perhaps be thought neceſſary to be publiſhed as the laſt teſtimony of my loyaltie to my King, for whom I now dye, and of my affection to my Countrey, for the purſuance of whoſe pious, and loyall Comands, I am now to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>That my Religion hath allwayes bin, and ſtill is <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> I am confident no man doubtes, I ſhall not therefore need to ſay much to that Particular, onely that I am of the true reformed Proteſtant Religion, as it is profeſſed in the Church of Scotland.</p>
            <p>I doe take God to witnes, that I haue bin conſtantly a loyall and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſubject, and ſervant to his late Majeſtie (in ſpite of all malice and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie,) I haue had the honour ſince my Childhood, to attend, and be neare him, till now of late, and during all that tyme I obſerved in him as eminent vertues, and as litle vice, as in any man I ever knew, And I dare ſay he <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33539:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 14 -->neuer harboured thought of Countenancing Popery in any of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, otherwiſe then was allowed by the Lawes of England, and that among all his Subjects, there could not be found a better Proteſtant then him ſelfe, And ſurely alſo, he was free from having any intent to exerciſe any tyranny, or abſolute Power, ouer his Subjects, and that he hath beene ſo unfortunate, I rather impute the Cauſe of it to the ſins of his people, then to his owne.</p>
            <p>For my owne part, I doe proteſt neuer to haue ſwerued from that true alleageance, which was due vnto him, and that hath Conſtantly bin paid (to my Comfort I ſpeake it) to his Progenitours, by my Anceſtours for many ages without ſpott, or diſhonour, and I hope ſhall be ſtill by my ſucceſſours to his poſterity.</p>
            <p>I doe heartily wiſh well to, and pray for, his Royall Iſſue, and ſhall dye a true, and loyall ſubject to his eldeſt ſon <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond the vnque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable King by right, of all his Fathers Kingdomes, I hope (though I doe not liue to ſee it) that Gods Juſtice and Goodnes will in his owne time eſtabliſh him on the throne of his Father, which I doubt not ſome of you will ſee come to paſſe, and I am Confident that till then, and ſoe long as men deepely plunged in guilt, and ſelfe Intereſt vſurpe power, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, Theſe Kingdomes will fall ſhort either of Peace, or any other permanent happines.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake this from my juſt affection to the Royall Race, and much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to his Majeſties Subjects, but not from any Malice, anger, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Reuenge, againſt any, for what I haue, or am to ſuffer, for I forgiue all men.</p>
            <p>It is well knowne what Calumnies, and aſperſions haue beene throwne vpon me, by men of ſeuerall Parties, and Intereſts, not excepting thoſe who would ſeeme to carrie much affection to his late Majeſtie as though I had expreſſed diſſeruice, or diſloyaltie vnto him, the which how mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and groundles they were, I appeale to God, who with my owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, clearely beareth witnes of my innocency therein, And I ſhall beg mercie from him to whom I am now to giue an account of all my thoughts and actions, as I haue ſtill had a faithfull, and a loyall heart to my Maſter.</p>
            <p>It hath bin a generall Complaint, that I perſwaded his Majeſtie to paſſe the Act for Contynuing this Parliament, I diſpute not whether the doing of <pb n="3" facs="tcp:33539:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 14 -->it at that time, might haue bin reputed good, or bad, but ſurely it was not I that did perſwade it.</p>
            <p>Neither did I at all, deale with his Majeſtie for his Conſent to the Bill of attainder, for taking away the life of the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> whoſe great parts, and affection, is knowne I highly valued, yet ſome haue beene pleaſed to attribute to me the Cauſe of that conceſſion, but were his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie now living, I am confident he would publiquely Cleare me in both theſe, as he hath bin pleaſed many tymes in priuate formerly to doe.</p>
            <p>And truely I am not conſcious to my ſelfe (though I haue bin for many yeares a privie Councellour to him) of euer giving him any aduice that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to other End (as I conceived) then the good and Peace of his Majeſtie and his Dominions.</p>
            <p>It hath bin rumoured, ſince my laſt impriſonment, that I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſelfe, to be the greateſt Inſtrument vnder his Majeſtie (by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vſe of his Scottiſh great Seale) for authoriſing the warre in Ireland, A report ſo falſe, and ſimple, as in my opinion, iudicious and honeſt men will not beleeue it, And truely, as I am free from having hand therein, in any maner of way, ſo, I am of nothing more confident, then that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie was alſo abſolutely free there of, and that he was not in any Caſe, a Cauſer or Countenancer, of thoſe Iriſh troubles.</p>
            <p>I haue bin often examined touching Perſons of ſeverall quallities within this kingdome, that (as is ſuppoſed) did invite into England the late Army from Scotland, or promiſed aſſiſtance after theire Comming, and of late much perſwaſion hath bin uſed with me to that purpoſe, as that vpon my diſcouerie thereof depended the onely meanes of my preſeruation, I will not ſay that I had any thing to reveale, which would haue beene ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but this I deſire you to atteſt to the world, that I haue not accuſed, or ſaid any thing, that may reflect on any man, of what degree ſoeuer within the Kings Dominions, And indeed, it was ſo Contrarie to my Conſcience, and ſo derogatorie to my honour, that if I had beene able yet I ſhould neuer haue preiudiced any in that nature, though it had beene to ſaue me a 100. liues.</p>
            <p>Touching that foule, and ſenceleſſe ſlander, that I betraid the Army vnder my Conduct, the care, and paines I then tooke to preuent the loſſe of it, and the neare approach of my ſuffring for it, will I ſuppoſe abundantly Contradict this aſperſion, I was ſatisfied with the juſtnes and neceſſity of <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33539:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 15 -->that engagement, vpon the Growndes of the Declaration of the Parliament of Scotland, fearing then, the ſad confuſions which hath ſince followed here, both in Church, and State, and particularly the fatall fall of my <hi>Maſter,</hi> to the preſervation of whoſe Perſon, I was by obligation, and a naturall affection, as paſſionately tied, as I could be by dutie, and allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.</p>
            <p>And now I confeſſe, I am void of all rancour, or diſpleaſure againſt any, though I am within few houres to dyes adiudged by a lawleſſe, and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Court of purpoſe erected (as is ſaid) to deſtroy my <hi>Maſter</hi> and ſome of his ſeruants, and for a great part compoſed of men <hi>Mechanick,</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be Judges, my death being decreed (right or wrong) as is reported before ever the tryall began, and though my death is no leſſe then murder, yet I forgiue all, and pray to God to doe it, and that my blood be not laid to theire Charge, or to ſome powerfull, and eminent mens, who, as is thought vpon ſome ſiniſter Ends, haue many moneths ſince Contriued my deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which now is ready to take effect.</p>
            <p>And though I haue anſwered to that Court, in regard of the juſtnes of my defence, which I thought would haue waighed with them, yet I neuer thought, nor doe I acknowledge any Iuriſdiction, or lawfull Authority in the ſame, not withſtanding, I doe with all Chriſtian humility ſubmitt to the Puniſhment which for my other perſonall ſins, the Lord hath juſtly brought vpon me.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have ſpoken much more, yet would not haue ſaid ſo much, but for feare leſt either my memorie might ſlipp it on the Scaffold, or that the rudenes of ſome people by noiſe or otherwiſe, might have interrupted me ſpeaking on this ſubject, Soe I thanke God, I am well prepared, God bleſſe you, Remember me to all my freinds.</p>
            <p>I know I haue beene a great ſinner, yet through faith I haue an aſſurance that God will forgiue me, and have mercie vpon me through the alone ſuffring, and interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt my Sauiour.</p>
