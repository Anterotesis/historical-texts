            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Serious Manifeſto and Declaration OF THE ANABAPTIST, And other Congregational CHURCHES, Touching the preſent Tranſactions of the Affairs of this Commonwealth, both in Church and State.</head>
            <p>WIth what unwearied vigour and zeal of Spirit we have alwayes ſought the promotion and advancement of the Kingdom of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Purity of the Goſpel, and Liberty of Conſcience, againſt all that have oppoſed themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſome preceding years can bear us Teſtimony; which we endevoured to do, not onely by wading through ſtreams of Blood and Danger in the late Wars, with the extremeſt hazard of all that was Dear and Near unto us; but alſo by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and fervent interceſſion, by tears and prayers unto Almighty God on that behalf.</p>
            <p>Nor need we here acquaint this preſent Age, with what ſucceſs they were anſwered from Him who is the Giver of all good: the reall Teſtimonies whereof are pregnant enough, from that ſweet and Chriſtian Liberty we all enjoyed, as well in our Civil Imployments, as our Religious Diſpenſations; and might from thence long ſince have expected and looked for a ſweet, laſting, and reall compoſure of Spirits and Intereſts in this Nation, Had not ſome (Ambitious of ſingle Power of Regality in themſelves, abetted and aſſiſted by others of like baſe and degenerating ſpirits) ſpoiled the Fabrick of our Peace and Happineſs, Levelling the Hope of our Settlement, to advance the height of his unjuſt and uſurped Power and Kingſhip.</p>
            <p>During the Reign of which Dragon, all knowing men can witneſs, how much the Churches of Chriſt then ſuffered, and all that bore Teſtimony to the Truth of the Lord Jeſus, both by Silencings, Sequeſtrings, Impriſonments and Death, not regarding of what Faith or Profeſſion, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends or Foes; but the (once) Boſom Friend, as well as the Common Enemy, were alike liable to his merciſeſs Cruelty. But, his Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was cut off with his Life, and his Progeny (from Ruling) by both.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not (therefore) need to mention thoſe few minutes of his Sons Reign, which laſted not much longer, than whilſt he contracted vaſt Debts for his Fathers Funeral, but ſoon vaniſh'd, leaving the Commonwealth dearly to pay both for the Erecting, and for the Pulling Down again of their Kingly Idol: Nor of what was acted in each after-Interval and Change, Affairs of State being alwayes left and found in ſuch counfuſion and diſorder, that the Churches of Chriſt were ſtill in jeopardy, and could very hardly get one look of favour or Protection from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Rulers: We having not (indeed) in all the Viciſſitudes theſe late years have afforded, beheld any viſible Rulers, on whom the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated Churches had more cauſe to fix a real hope of liberty and freedom-on (as to Spirituals) than on that part of the Officers of the Army late reſiding in <hi>Wallingford-Houſe</hi> (whom we do Reſolve to adhere to, and ſtand by) whoſe zeal to the Cauſe of Chriſt and his Churches, as well as Conſcience and Care of the Peoples Rights and Liberties, put them upon the Neceſſity of that kinde of Aſſembling and Acting: by whom, (had they not been ſo unworthily deſerted and betrayed by ſome of their own Fellows and Servants) we might have ſeen ere this the greateſt day of rejoycing and gladneſs amongſt the Churches of Chriſt, that all or any of the foregoing Ages have either ſeen or read of.</p>
            <p>Being therefore deeply ſenſible of our preſent ſufferings, (by the loſs of thoſe our worthy Patriots, and Church-defenders) and of the real Cauſers thereof: And finding at this preſent (to our great grief, as well as admiration) That at this time the implacable Enemies of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (the late Secluded Members) are again admitted, and do now daily Sit and Vote in Parliament; from whoſe violent tempers of Spirit (according to their former expreſt fury) we are in all likelyhood to expect our common Peace to be perturbed, our Meetings diſſolved, and our Perſons endangered, if ſome timely and neceſſary proviſion for prevention thereof be not made and provided.</p>
            <p>And we have yet further confidence to ſpeak, That as we are not (if united) an inconſiderable part of this Nation, both in reſpect of Power, Eſtates and Strength: So we hope no ſober and unbyaſſed perſons can think it conſiſtent with our Reaſon and Intereſt, to ſuffer a trampling upon by Forms of Baniſhment, Sequeſtrations, and unjuſt Proclamations for making ſome of us Traytors, who long ſince have learnt to <hi>deny the Power of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore we do hereby Manifeſt and Declare, on the behalf of our ſelves, and all other Congregational Churches within this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, holding the Faith of the Lord Jeſus in Word and Doctrine, That we ſhall not ſubmit to any Qualifications of Parliament in point of Faith and Religion, (a force; we hear, intended to be put upon our Conſciences) other than ſhall conſiſt with the true Teachings and Guidance of the holy Spirit. Nor ſhall we hold our ſelves obliged to render obedience to this preſent State-conjunction, without the full and free reſtitution and admiſſion of the Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> &amp;c. lately Members of the <hi>Committee of Safety.</hi> And we do further Declare, That we ſhall with our Lives and Fortunes, and to our utmoſt Power and Abilities, Aſſiſt, Promote, Adhere to, and ſtand by thoſe true and faithful Aſſertors of the Cauſe of Chriſt and his Churches: Looking upon all other Parties and Intereſts, but as ſuch <hi>who have kindled a fire, and compaſſed themſelves about with sparks; that</hi> may <hi>walk in the light of their fire, and in the sparks that they have kindled: But this ſhall they have at the hand of the Lord, They ſhall lie down in Sorrow.</hi>
