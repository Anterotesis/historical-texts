         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO MY WORTHY
AND MVCH ESTEEMED FRIEND,
Sir Thomas Richardson, Knight.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, I now send you your long since promised
<hi>Celestina,</hi> put into English cloathes; I shall
intreate you to giue her a friendly welcome,
because she is a stranger, and come purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of Spaine into these parts, to see you,
and kisse your hands. I would not accompany her with
my letters of recommendation, whereby she might finde
the better reception. For, I must ingeniously confesse, that
this your <hi>Celestina</hi> is not <hi>sine scelere;</hi> yet must I tell you
withall, that she cannot be harboured with you, <hi>sine vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</hi>
Her life is foule, but her Precepts faire; her example
naught, but her Doctrine good; her Coate ragged, but her
mind inriched with many a golden Sentence: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take her not as she seemes, but as she is; and the rather,
because blacke sheepe haue as good Carcasses as white.
You shall finde this booke to be like a Court-Iack, which
though it be blacke, yet holds as good liquor as your fairest
Flagon of siluer or like the Rod that <hi>Brutus</hi> offred to <hi>Apollo,</hi>
which was rough and knottie without, but within, all of
furbusht gold. The barke is bad, but the tree good.</p>
            <p>Vouchsafe then (gentle Sir) to take a little of this coorse
and sowre bread; it may be, your stomack being glutted
with more delicate Cates, may take some pleasure to restore
your appetite with this homely, though not altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauoury
food. It is good plaine houshold-bread, honest
messeline; there is a great deale of Rye in it, but the most
part of it is pure Wheate.</p>
            <p>Our Author is but short, yet pithy: not so full of words
<pb facs="tcp:7594:3"/>
as sense; each other line, being a Sentence; vnlike to many
of your other Writers, who either with the luxury of their
phrases, or superfluity of figures, or superabundancie of
ornaments, or other affected guildings of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
Cookes, make their meats either too sweet, or too
tarte, too salt, or too full of pepper; whence it hapneth,
that like greedy Husbandmen, by inlarging their hand in
sowing, they make the haruest thin and barren. It is not as
many of your Pamphlets be, like a tree without sap; a
bough without frut; a nut without a kernell; flesh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bones; bones without marrow; prickles without a
Rose; waxe without honey; straw without wheate; sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fure
without Gold; or shels without pearle. But you
shall find Sentences worthy to be written, not in fragile pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but in Cedar, or lasting Cypresse, not with the quill of
a Goose, but the feather of a <hi>Phoenix;</hi> not with inke, but Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salmum;
not with letters of a blacke tincture, but with
Characters of Gold and Azure; and deseruing to be read,
not only of a lasciuious <hi>Clodius,</hi> or effeminate <hi>Sardanaplus,</hi>
but of the grauest <hi>Cato,</hi> or seuerest Stoick.</p>
            <p>All which, though I know to be true, yet doubt I not,
but it will meete with some detractors, who like dogges
that barke by custome, will exclaime against the whole
worke, because some part of it seemeth somewhat more
obscene, then may sute with a ciuill stile: which as I not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
so sithence it is written reprehensiuely, &amp; not instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely,
I see no reason why they should more abstaine from
reading a great deale of good, because they must picke it
out of that which is bad; then they should refuse Pearle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is fisht for in a froathy sea; or contemne Gold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is drawn from a dirty myne; or hate honey, because
it is hiued in straw; or loath silke, because it is lapt in soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
Which kinde of men I can liken to none better, then
those of whom <hi>Plutarke</hi> complainth, who are of so nice a
delicacie, that they will not drinke a wholesome potion,
vnlesse it be giuen them in a Golden cup, nor weare a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
garment vnlesse it bee wouen of <hi>Athenian</hi> wooll.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7594:3"/>
The <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> who were as strict liuers, and as great
louers of vertue, as any Nation whatsoeuer; would make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
euen out of vices. But these Criticall companions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a depraued disposition, and apt in themselues to be
euill, I can compare to nothing better, then the <hi>Scarabee,</hi>
who ouer-flying the most fragrant flowers, chooseth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to settle in a Cow-shard, then to light vpon a Rose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or <hi>Noahs</hi> Crow, which flew forth of the Arke, and preying
vpon carrion, returned no more. Howsoeuer therfore these
rigid reprehenders will not sticke to say of <hi>Celestina,</hi> that she
is like a Crow amongst so many Swans; like a Grashop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
amongst so many Nightingales; or like a Paper-blurrer
amongst so many famous Writers; yet they that are learned
in her language, haue esteemed it (in comparison of others)
as Gold, amongst metalls; as the Carbuncle amongst
stones; as the Rose amongst flowers; as the Palme amongst
trees; as the Eagle amongst Birds; and as the Sunne amongst
inferior Lights; In a word, as the choisest &amp; chiefest. But as
the light of that great Planet doth hurt sore eies, and comfort
those that are sound of sight: So the reading of <hi>Celestina,</hi> to
those that are prophane, is as poyson to their hearts; but to
the chaste, and honest minde, a preseruatiue against such
inconueniences as occurre in the world.</p>
            <p>And for mine owne part, I am of opinion, that Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
may as well be borne withall, as Painters, who now
and then paint those actions that are absurd. As <hi>Timomachus</hi>
painted <hi>Medea</hi> killing her children; <hi>Orestes,</hi> murthering
his mother <hi>Theo,</hi> and <hi>Parrhasius; Vlysses</hi> counterfaited mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s,
and <hi>Cherephanes,</hi> the immodest imbracements of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with men. Which the Spectators beholding, doe not
<hi>laudare rem, sed; artem</hi> not commend the matter which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in the imitation, but the Art and skill of the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which hath so liuely represented what it proposed.
In like sort, when wee reade the filthy actions of whores,
their wicked conditions, and beastly behauiour, wee are
neither to approue them as good, nor to imbrace them as
honest, but to commend the Authors iudgement in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
<pb facs="tcp:7594:4"/>
his Argument so fit and pat to their dispositions.</p>
            <p>Nor doe I see any more reason, why a man should proue
a Villaine by reading of other mens villanies, then a man
should grow hard-fauored, by looking <hi>Thirsites</hi> in the face,
or a foole, for viewing <hi>Will Summers</hi> picture: But might
rather grow as the Lacedaemonians did by their slaues
drunkennesse, to a detestation of so foule a sinne. When
therefore thou shalt reade of <hi>Celestina,</hi> as of a notorious
Bawd; of <hi>Sempronio</hi> and <hi>Parmeno,</hi> as of false seruants; of
<hi>Elicia</hi> and <hi>Areusa,</hi> as of cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning queanes and profest whores;
of <hi>Centurio,</hi> as of a swaggring Ruffian, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master;
of <hi>Calisto</hi> and <hi>Melibea,</hi> as of vndiscreet and foolish
Louers. And so in the rest, learne thereby to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
good and bad, and praise the Author, though not
the practice; for these things are written more for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
then imitation. And the minde that comes so
instructed, can neuer take harme; for it will take the best,
and leaue the worst: But he that reads all things alike, and
equally entertaines them in his thought, that Reader shall
easily shew himselfe obnoxious to many vices: And it
shall happen vnto him, as it did vnto those who imitated
<hi>Plato</hi>'s crookednes, or <hi>Demosthenes</hi> stammering. But when
a Reader shall light vpon vnworthy lines, I would haue
him cry out as a Philosopher aduiseth on the like occasion;
<hi>Male hoc, &amp; inconuenienter.</hi> But when he meets with good;
<hi>Rectè hoc &amp; decorè.</hi> As the Bee feeds vpon flowers, &amp; the Goat
on the tops of herbs; so would I haue him that reades <hi>Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
graze like a horse on that which is sweet and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
grasse; and not like a hungrie dog, which snatches and
bites at euery thing that comes in his way. <hi>Socrates,</hi> when he
saw a dishonest woman, would either turne his head aside,
or couer his eyes with his cloake; taking whores to bee
like coales, which either blacke or burne. Indeede, it was
the wisest way for <hi>Socrates;</hi> for though he were a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
yet withall he was a wanton: and therefore, for such
as cannot looke, but must offend in viewing of the loose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Lines, I would haue them imitate the Lightning, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth,
<pb facs="tcp:7594:4"/>
before it scarce appeares; or your Abortiues, which
die, before they be borne. But for as those that are truely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and of that perfit temper of goodnes, that nothing can
make them decline from the rule of vertue, I would wish
them to do with some pieces in this booke (yet to reade all,
and where they finde anything vnseemly) as the Priests of
old were wont to do, who in their sacrifices vnto <hi>Iuno,</hi> took
forth the garbage of their beasts, and threw it behinde the
Altar. If any phrase sauor of immodesty, blame not me, but
<hi>Celestina.</hi> If any Sentence deserue commendation, praise not
the Translator, but the Author; for I am no more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
or commended, then the poore P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an <hi>Elicia,</hi> or an <hi>Areusa,</hi> a <hi>Celestina,</hi> or a <hi>Centurio,</hi> I would haue
them to behold themselues in this glasse; not doubting, but

            <p>But to leaue <hi>Celestina</hi> to a fauourable censure, I must now
come to intreate some fauor for my selfe, who am so farre

selfe to your fauourable interpretation; for I must ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
confesse, that I haue in the vndergoing of this transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
shewn more boldnesse then iudgement. For though
I doe speake like <hi>Celestina,</hi> yet come I short of her; for she is
so concisely significant, and indeede so differing is the Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome
of the Spainish from the English, that I may imitate
it, but not come neere it. Yet haue I made it as naturall,
as our language will giue leaue, and haue more beaten my
braines about it in some places, then a man would beate a
Flint to get fire; and, with much adoe, haue forced those
<pb facs="tcp:7594:5"/>
sparkes, which increasing to a greater flame, gaue light to
my darke vnderstanding; wherein if I haue been wanting
to giue it it's true life, I wish, my industry heerein may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake

which as I shall alwaies be willing to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
so I desire to haue them mended by some better hand;
nor am I any whit ashamed that any worke of mineshould
not be absolutely perfect. For it is the Statute and Decree
of Heauen, that euery composition heere beneath, as well
framed by the hand of Art, as fashioned by the helpe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

those liuely colours, which others more skilfull might giue
it; and might better it as much, if they would vndergo the
paines; as bad faces are bettered by painting, and vnsauory
meates mended by their sauces. But I am too saucie in my

that I make no question, but my workes shall be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted

            <head>The Prologue.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the saying of that great and wise Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<hi>Heraclitus;</hi> That all things are created
in manner of a contention, or battell. His
words are these, <hi>Omnia secundùm litem
fiunt.</hi> A Sentence in my opinion, worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
memorie; and, for that most certaine it
is, that euery word of a wise man, is pregnant, and full; of this it may
be said, that through too much fulnesse it is readie to burst, shooting
forth such spreading, and well-growne boughs and leaues, that out of
the smallest Sucker, or least Sprig thereof, fruit enough may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by men of discretion and iudgement. But because my poore
vnderstanding is not able to doe anymore, then to nibble on the drie
bark and rugged rinde of the wise sayings of those, who for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and excellencie of their wits, deserued to be approued; with that
little which I shall plucke from thence, I will satisfie the intent and
purpose of this short Prologue. This Sentence did I finde to be streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
by that great Orator, and Poet Lauriat <hi>Francisco Petrar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
who tells vs, <hi>Sine lite at<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> offensione nihil genuit natura
parens:</hi> That Nature, who is the mother of all things, ingendred
nothing without strife and contention. Furthermore saying, <hi>Sic
est enim, &amp; sic propemodun vniuersa testantur; Rapido
stellae obuiant firmamento; Contraria inuicem Elementa
confligunt; Terrae tremunt; Mariafluctuant; Aër quati
tur; Crepant flammae; Bellum immortale venti gerunt;
Tempora temporibus concertant; secum, singula; Nobis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum
omnia.</hi> Which is as much to say; Indeede so it is, and so
all things almost in the world doe witnesse as much. The Starres
incounter one another in the a hirling firmament of heauen; your
contrarie Elements wage warre each with other; the earth, that
<pb facs="tcp:7594:6"/>
trembles and quakes, as if it were at oddes with it selfe; the Sea,
that swels and rages, breaking it's billowes one against another; the
Ayre, that darteth arrowes of lightning, and is moued this way and
that way; the flames, they cracke, and sparkle forth their furie;
the windes are at perpetuall enmitie with themselues; times with
times doe contend; one thing against another, and all against vs.
We see, that the Summer makes vs complaine of too much heate;
and the Winter, of cold and sharpenesse of weather. So that this,
which seemeth vnto vs a temporall reuolution; this, by which we
are bred vp, and nourished, and liue, if it once beginne to passe
aboue it's proportion, and to grow to a greater highth then vsuall,
it is no better then open warre. And how much it ought to bee
feared, is manifested by those great earth-quakes and whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds,
by those ship-wrackes and fires, as well in the ayre, as the
earth; by the sourse of water-courses, and violence of inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by those courses, and recourses, those rackings to and fro of
the Clouds, of whose open motions, to know the secret cause from
whence they proceed, no lesse is the dissention of the Philosophers
in the schooles, then of the waues of the Sea. Besides, among your
bruit beasts, there is not any one of them that wants his warre;
be they Fishes, Birds, Beasts, or Serpents; whereof, euery kinde
persecuteth, and pursueth one another: The Lyon, hee pursues the
Wolfe; the Wolfe the Kidde; the Dog the Hare. And if it might
not be thought a Iable, or old wifes tale, sitting by the fire side, I
should more fully inlarge this Theame. The Elephant, that is so
powerfull and strong a beast, is afraide, and flies from the sight of a
poore silly Mouse; and no sooner heares him comming, but hee
quakes and trembles for feare. Amongst Serpents, Nature crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Basiliske, so venomous and poysonfull, and gaue him such a
predominant power ouer all the rest, that onely with his hissing, he
doth affright them; with his comming, put them to flight, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perseth
some one way, some another, and with his sight, kills and
murders them. The Viper, a crawling creature, and venomous
Serpent, at the time of ingendring, the Male puts his head into the
mouth of the Female, and shee through the great delight, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of her pleasure, straines him so hard, that she kills him. And
conceiuing her young, the eldest, or first of her brood, breakes the
<pb facs="tcp:7594:6"/>
barres of his mothers belly, eates out his way thorow her bowels,
at which place all the rest issue forth; whereof she dies; hee doing
this, as a reuenger of his fathers death. What greater conflict, what
greater contention or warre can there be, then to conceiue that in
her body, which shall eate out her Intralls? Againe, no lesse natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
dissention can we suppose to be amongst fishes; for most certaine
it is, that the Sea doth containe as many seuerall sorts of fishes, as the
earth and ayre do nourish bords and beasts; and much more. <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
and <hi>Pliny</hi> doe recount wonders of a little fish called <hi>Aeche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis;</hi>
how apt his nature is, and how prone his propertie for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers
kindes of contentions, especially this one; that if hee cling to a
shiper Carrack, he will detaine and stop her in her course, though she
haue the winde in the poope of her, and cut the Seas with neuer so
stiffe a gale. Whereof <hi>Lucan</hi> maketh mention, saying,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Non puppim retinens,<note place="margin">Lucan. lib. 6. iuxta finem.</note> Euro tendente rudentes,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Nor</hi> Aecheneis, whose strength, though Eurus rise,</l>
               <l>Can stay the course of shippes.</l>
            </q>
            <p>O naturall contention! worthy of admiration, that a little fish
should be able to doe more then a great ship, with all the force and
strength of the winds. Moreouer, if we will discourse of birds, and of
their frequent enmities, we may truly affirm, that all things are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in a kind of contention. Your greater liue of rapine, as Eagles
and Hawks; and your crauen Kites presse vpon our Pullen, insulting
ouer them euen in our own houses, and offring to take them euen from
vnder the Hens wings. Of a bird called Roque, which is bred in the
East Indian Sea, it is said to be of an incredible greatnesse, that the
like hath neuer bin heard of; and that with her beake, she will hoyse
vp into the ayre, not only one man, or ten, but a whole ship laden with
men and merchandise; and how that these miserable passengers,
hanging thus in suspence in the ayre, till her wings waxe weary, she
lets them fall, and so they receiue their deaths. But what shall we say
of men, to whom all the foresaid creatures are subiect? Who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
their wars, their iars, their enmities, their enuies, their heats,
their broyles, their brawles, and their discontentments? That
change and alteration of fashions in their apparell? That pulling
downe and building vp of houses? and many other sundry effects
<pb facs="tcp:7594:7"/>
and varieties; all of them proceeding from the feeble and weake
condition of mans variable nature? And because it is an old and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
complaint, and vsed heretofore time out of minde; I will not
much maruell, if this present worke shall proue an instrument of war
to its Readers, putting strifes and differences amongst them, euery one
giuing his verdict and opinion thereupon, according to the humour
of his owne will. Some perhaps may say that it is too long; some too
short; others to be sweet and pleasant; and other some to be darke
and obscure: So that to cut it out to the measure of so many, and such
different dispositions, is onely appropriate to God; Especially, since
that it, together with all other things, whatsoeuer are in this
world, march vnder the standard of this noble Sentence; For euen
the very life of men, if we consider them from their first and tendeer
age, till they grow gray-headed, is nothing else but a battell. Children
with their sports, boyes with their bookes, young men with their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
old men with a thousand sorts of infirmities, skirmish and
warre continually: and these Papers, with all ages. The first blots
and teares them; the second knowes not well how to read them; the
third (which is the cheerefull liuelihood of youth, and set all vpon
iollity) doth vtterly dislike of them. Some gnaw onely the bones, but
do not picke out the marrow, saying there is no goodnesse in it; that it
is a History, huddled, I know not how, together, a kind of hodgepode,
or gallimaufrey; not profiting themselues out of the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
accounting it a fable, or old wifes tale, fitting for nothing, saue
only for to passe away the time vpon the way. Others call out the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
conceits, and common prouerbs, highly commending them, but
slighting and neglecting that which makes more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and their profit. But they for whose true pleasure it is wholy
framed, reiect the story it selfe, as a vayne and idle subiect, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out the pith and marrow of the matter for their owne good and
benefit, and laugh at those things that sauour onely of wit, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
conceite, storing vp in their memorie, the sentences and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Philosophers, that they may transpose them into such fit pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as may make, vpon occasion, for their owne vse and purpose.
So that when ten men shall meete together to heare this Comedy, in
whom perhaps shall happen this difference of dispositions, as it vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
falleth out; who will deny, but that there is a contention in that
<pb facs="tcp:7594:7"/>
thing which is so diuersly vnderstood? the Printers, they likewise
haue bestowed their puncture, putting Titles, and adding Arguments
to the beginning of euery Act; deliuering in briefe, what is more
largely contained therein; a thing very excusable, in former times
being much vsed, and in great request with your ancient Writers;
others haue contended about the name, saying, that it ought not to
be called a Comedy, because it ends in sorrow and mourning, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
termed a Tragedy. The Authour himselfe would haue it take
it's denomination from it's beginning, which treates of pleasure, and
therfore call'd it a Comedy. So that I seeing these differences, between
their extremes haue parted this quarrell, by diuiding it in the midst,
and call it a Tragick-Comedy. So that obseruing these contentions,
these disagreements, these dissonant and various iudgements, I had
an eye, to marke whither the maior part inclined, and found that
they were all desirous, that I should inlarge my selfe in the pursuite
of the delight of these Louers; whereunto, I haue been earnestly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned;
in so much, that I haue consented (though against my
will) to put now the second time my Penne to this so strange a taske,
and so farre estranged from my faculty, stealing some houres from my
principall studies, together with others allotted to my recreation,
though I know, I shall not want new Detractors for my new
Edition.</p>

suffer him to weepe who suffers to sorrow, for teares and sighes doe
ease the heart that is surcharded with griefe; but then againe, if he
see mee in sight, I shall see him more incensed against mee: For
there the sunne scorcheth most, where he reflecteth most: the sight
which hath no obiect set before it, waxeth weary-and dull, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
its obiect, is as quicke. And therefore I thinke it my best play,
to play least in sight, and to stay a little longer; but if in the meane
while he should kill himselfe, then farewell he. Perhaps I may get
more by it then euery man is aware of, and cast my skinne,
changing rags for robes, and penury for plenty: But it is an old say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
He that lookes after dead-mens shooes, may chance to goe
barefoote: Perhaps also the diuell hath deceiued me. And so his
death may be my death, and then all the fat is in the fire: The rope
will go after the Bucket: and one losse follow another; on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
your wise men say, That it is a great ease to a grieued soule,
or one that is afflicted, to haue a companion, to whom he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
his sorrow. Besides, it is generally receiued, that the
wound which bleedes inward, is euer the more dangerous. Why
then in these two extremes hang I in suspence what I were best to
doe? Sure, the safest is to enter: and better it is that I should
indure his anger, then for feare of his displeasure to forbeare to
comfort him. For, if it be possible to cure without Arte, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
things ready at hand, farre easier is it to cure by Arte, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
nothing that is necessary.</p>

Know you (Sir) what they doe? They doe things that are too hard
for any man to vnderstand: they obserue no meane; they haue no

the first themselues that cause <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the first that beginne to loath. They will priuately pleasure him,
whom afterwards they will openly wrong, and draw him secretly
in at their windowes, whom in the streetes they will publikely raile
at. They will giue you roste-meate, and beate you with the spit.
They will inuite you vnto them, and presently send you packing
with a flea in your eare; Call you, and yet exclude you; seale you
her loue, and yet proclaime hate; quickly be wonne, and quickly be
lost; soone pleased, and as soone displeased; and (which is the true
humour of a woman) whatsoeuer her will diuines, that must bee
affected. Her apprehensions admit no delayes; and bee they
impossible to bee attained to, yet not effecting them, she streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
censures it want of wit or affection, if not both. O what a

                  <p>I will beginne first with her haires; Hast thou seene those
skaynes of fine twisted gold which are spun in <hi>Arabia?</hi> Her haires
are more fine, and shine no lesse then they; the length of them is to
the lowest pitch of her heele, besides, they are daintily combed,
and dressed, and knit vp in knots with curious fine ribbaning, as
shee her selfe pleaseth to adorne and set them foorth, being of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
themselues, without any other helpe, to transforme men into
stones.</p>

                  <p>Her eyes are quicke, cleare and full; the hayres to those
lids rather long then short; Her eye-browes thinnish, not thicke of
hayre, and so prettily arched, that by their bent, they are much
the more beautifull; Her nose of such a middling size, as may not be
mended; Her mouth little; Her teeth small and white; her lips
red and plumpe; The forme of her face rather long then round;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7594:13"/>
Her brests placed in a fitting height; but their rising roundnesse, and
the pretty pleasing fashion of her little tender nipples, who is able
to figure foorth vnto thee? So distracted is the eye of man when he
does behold them; Her skinne as smooth, soft, and sleeke as Satten,
and her whole body so white, that the snow seemes darknesse vnto
it; Her colour so mingled, and of so singular a temper, as if she had
chosen it her selfe.</p>

nayles large and well coloured; seeming Rubies, intermixt with
pearles. The proportion of those other parts which I could not eye,
vndoubtedly (judging things vnseene, by the seene) must of force
be incomparably farre better then that, which <hi>Paris</hi> gaue his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

rascall) and open the doore. Well, it is an old saying, and I perceiue,
as true, The fish leaps out of the panne, and falls into the fire. And a
man thinking to shunne one danger, runnes into another, worse
then the former. For I thinking to keep close this matter from <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meno,</hi>

                  <p>Sir why doe you vexe your selfe? why grieue you? Doe you
thinke, that in the eares of this woman, the name, by which I now
call her doth any way sound reproachfully? Beleeue it not. Assure
your selfe, she glories as much in this name, as oft as shee heares it,
as you do, when you heare some voyce, <hi>Calisto</hi> to be a gallant Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
Besides, by this is she commonly called, and by this Title
is shee of all men generally knowne. If she passe along the streetes
among a hundred women, and some one perhaps blurts out, See,
where's the old Bawd; without any impatiency, or any the least
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7594:15"/>
distemper, shee presently turnes her selfe about, nods the head, and
answers them with a smiling countenance, and cheerefull looke. At
your solemne banquets, your great feasts, your weddings, your gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippings,
your merry meetings, your funeralls, and all other assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
whatsoeuer, where there is any resort of people, thither doth
shee repaire, and there they make pastime with her. And if shee

name; If shee come amongst birds, they haue no other note but
this; If she sight vpon a flocke of sheepe, their bleatings proclaime
no lesse; If she meet with beasts, they bellow forth the same: The
frogges that lie in ditches, croake no other tune; Come shee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
your Smithes, your Carpenters, your Armourers, your Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers,
your Brasiers, your Ioyners: why, their hammers beate all
vpon this word. In a word, all sorts of tooles and instruments
returne no other Eccho in the ayre; your Shoomakers sing
this song; your Combe-makers joyne with them, your Gardeners,
your Plough-men, your Reapers, you Vine-keepers passe away the
paine fulnesse of their labours, in making her the subject of their
discourse; your Table-players, and all other Gamesters neuer lose,
but they peale foorth her prayses: To be short, be she wheresoeuer
she be, all things whatsoeuer are in this world, repeate no other
name but this: O what a deuourer of rosted egges was her husband?
What would you more? Not one stone that strikes against another,

since my mother dwelt in her Parish, who being intreated by this
<hi>Celestina,</hi> gaue me vnto her to wait vpon her, though now she know
me not, growne out perhaps of her remembrance; as well by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the short time I abode with her, as also through the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which age hath wrought vpon mee.</p>

                  <speaker>Calisto.</speaker>
                  <l>What seruice didst thou doe her?</l>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Parme.</speaker>
                  <p>I went into the market place, and fetch't her vitailes; I
waited on her in the streetes, and supplyed her wants in other the
like seruices, as farre as my poore sufficiency, and slender strength
was able to performe. So that though I continued but a little
while with her, yet I remember euery thing as fresh, as if it were
but yesterday, in so much that old-age hath not been able to weare
it out. This good honest whore, this graue matrone, forsooth, had
at the very end of the Citty, there where your Tanners dwell, close
by the waterside, a lone house, somewhat far from neighbours, halfe
of it fallen downe, ill contriued, and worse furnished. Now, for to
get her liuing, yee must vnderstand, shee had sixe seuerall Trades:
shee was a Laundresse, a Persumeresse, a Former of faces, a Mender
of crackt maiden-heads, a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d, and had some smatch of a Witch;
Her first Trade was a cloak to all the test; vnder color wherof, being
withall a piece of a Sempstresse, many young wenches that were of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7594:16"/>
your ordinary sorts of seruants, came to her house to worke: some
on smockes, some on gorgets and many other things: but not one of
them that came thither, but brought with her either bacon, wheate,
flower, or a Iar of wine, or some other the like prouision, which they
could conueniently steale from their Mistresses, and some other
thefts of greater quality, making her house (for shee was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer,
and kept all things close) the Rendeuous of all their
Roguery: she was a great friend to your Students, Noble mens
Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erers, and Pages: To these shee sold that innocent blood of
these poore miserable soules, who did easily aduenture their virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
drawne on by faire promises, and the restitution and reparation
which she would make them of their lost maiden-heads. Nay, shee
proceeded so far, that by cunning meanes, she had accesse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with your very Vestalls, and neuer left them, till shee
had brought her purpose to passe. And what time do you think she
chose when she would deale with any of these? At the time of their
chiefest ceremonies; as when they kept their most mysterious ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of the feasts of their <hi>Vesta,</hi> nay, and that most strictly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized
day of <hi>Bona Dea,</hi> where it is death to admit men: euen then
by vnheard of disguises, she had her plots and proiects effectually
working vpon them, to the vtter abolition of their vowes and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity.
Now, what thinke you, were the trades and marchandise
wherein she dealt? She professed her selfe a kinde of Phisician, and
fained that shee had good skill in curing of little children: Shee
would goe and fetch flaxe from one house, and put it forth to spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to another, that she might thereby haue pretence for the freer
accesse vnto all: One would cry, Here mother: and another, There
mother: Look, saies the third, where the old woman comes: Yonder
comes that Bel-dame so well knowne to all. Yet notwithstanding all
these her cares, troubles, and trottings to and fro, being neuer out
of action, she would neuer misse any great meeting, any religious
processions, any Nuptials, Loue-ties, Balls, maskes or games what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer;
They were the onely markets, where she made all her bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines.
And at home in her owne house shee made perfumes, false
and counterfait Storax, Beniamin, Gumme, Anime, Amber, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit,
Powders, Muske and Mosqueta: Shee had a chamber full of
Limbecks, little vialls, pots, some of earth, some of glasse, some
brasse, and some tinne, formed in a thousand fashions. Shee made
sublimated Mercury, boyled confections for to clarifie the skinne,
waters to make the face glister, paintings, some white, some ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million,
lip-salues, scarlet-dy'd cloathes, fitted purposely for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to rub their faces therewith, oyntments for to make the face
smooth, lustrifications, clarifications, pargetings, fardings, waters
for the morphewes, and a thousand other slibber slabbers: Some
made of the lees of wine, some of daffadills, some of the barkes and
rindes of trees, some of Scar-wolfe, otherwise called Cittibush, or
Trifolium, some of Taragon, some of Centory, some of sowre
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7594:16"/>
grapes, some of Must, or new wine taken from the presse, first
distilled, and afterwards sweetned with sugar. Shee had a tricke to
supple and refine the skin with the juice of Lemmons, with Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
with the marrow of Deere, and of Heron-shawes, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
the like confections: shee distilled sweet-waters, of Roses, of
Flowers, of Oranges, of Iesmine, of three-leafed Grasse, of Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine,
of Gilly-flowers, incorporated with Muske and Ciuit, and
sprinkled with wine: shee made likewise Lees, for to make the

some shee holpe with little bladders, and other some she stitch't vp

certain fine small needles, such as your Glouers sowe withall,
and threds of the slenderest &amp; smallest silke, rubb'd ouer with wax:
she had also roots hanging there of Folia-Plasme, Fuste-sanguinio,
Squill or Sea-Onion, and ground Thistle. With these she did work
wonders; and when the French Embassadour came thither, shee
made sale of one of her wenches, three seuerall times for a virgin.</p>

                  <p>Beleeue mee (Sir) it is true as I tell you. Besides, out of
charity forsooth, she relieued many Orphanes, and many straggling
wenches, which recommended themselues vnto her. In another
partition, she had her knacks for to help those that were loue-sicke,
and to make them to be beloued againe, and obtaine their desires.
And for this purpose, shee had the bones that are bred in a Stagges
heart, the tongue of a Viper, the heads of Quailes the braines of
an Asse, the kalls of young Coltes, when they are new foaled, the
bearing cloth of a new-borne babe, Barbary beanes, a Sey-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,

A Horne-fish, the halter of a man that hath beene hang'd,
Iuse berries, the prickles of a Hedge-hogge, the foote of a Badger,
Fearne-seed, the stone of an Eagles nest, and a thousand other things.
Many both men and women came vnto her: of some she would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a piece of that bread where they had bit it: of others, some
part of their apparell: of some, shee would craue to haue of their
hayre: others, she would draw characters in the palmes of their
hands with Saffrom; with othersome she would doe the same with
a kinde of colour, which you call Vermilion: to others she would
giue hearts made of waxe, and stucke full of broken needles; and
many other the like things, made in clay, and some in lead, very
fearefull, and ghastly to behold: shee would draw circles, portraite
foorth figures, and mumble many strange words to her selfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
her eyes still fixed on the ground. But who is able to deliuer

in regard of that, which I haue heard thee speake against
me: whereof I make no more reckoning, but am content to let it
passe. For, vertue teacheth vs to suffer temptations, and not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
euill for euill; and especially when wee are tempted by young
men, such as want experience, and are not acquainted with the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

vndoe both themselues and their Masters, as thou thy selfe dost,
<hi>Calisto.</hi> I heard you well inough, not a word you said, that escaped

old age hath made me lose my hearing; for not onely that which
I see, heare, and know, but euen the very inward secrets of thy heart

to know (<hi>Permeno</hi>) that <hi>Calisto</hi> is loue-sicke, sicke euen to the death.
Nor art thou for this, to censure him to be a weak and foolish man:
for vnresistable loue subdueth all things. Besides, I would haue thee
to know, if thou knowst it not already, that there are these two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
that are euermore infallibly true. The first is, that euery
man must of force loue a woman, and euery woman loue a man.
The second is, that he who truely loues, must of necessity be much
troubled &amp; mou'd with the sweetnes of that superexcellent delight,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was ordain'd by him that made all things, for the perpetuating
of mankind, without which, it must needs perish: and not only in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

me, <hi>Parmeno?</hi> It is he in good truth, it is hee. Come hither vnto

should discouer vnto thee a certain place, where, vnder many a lock
and key, she hath left thee more store of Gold and Siluer, then all
the reuenewes come to, that thy Master <hi>Calisto</hi> hath in his posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
And because I solemnly vow'd, and bound my selfe by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
vnto her, that I would see her desire, as far foorth as lay in me,
to be well and truely performed, she peacefully departed this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
life; and though a mans faith ought to be inuiolably obserued
both to the liuing and the dead, yet more especially to the dead; for
they are not able to doe any thing of themselues, they cannot come
to me, and prosecute their right here vpon earth. I haue spent much
time &amp; mony in inquiring &amp; searching after thee, &amp; could neuer till
now heare what was become of thee: and it is not aboue three daies
since, that I first heard of your being, and where you abode. Verily,
it hath much grieued me, that thou hast gon trauelling, &amp; wandring
throughout the world, as thou hast done from place, to place, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thy time, without either gaine of profit, or of friends. For, (as
<hi>Seneca</hi> saith) Trauellers haue many ends, and few friends. For, in
so short a time they can neuer fasten friendship with any: and hee
that is euery where, is said to be no where. Againe, that meat can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
benefit the body, which is no sooner eaten, then eiected. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth any thing more hinder it's health, then your diuersities,
and changes of meates. Nor doth that would come to be healed,
which hath daily change of tents, and neuer plasters. Nor doth that
Tree neuer proue, which is often transplanted and remoued from
one ground to another. Nor is there any thing to profitable, which
at the first sight bringeth profit with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore (my good sonne)
leaue off these violencies of youth, and following the doctrine, and
rule of thy Ancestors, returne vnto reason, settle thy selfe in some
one place or other. And where better, then where I shal aduise thee,
taking mee, and my counsell along with thee, to whom thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
both by thy father and mother? And I, as if I were
thine owne true mother, say vnto thee, vpon those curses and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictions,
which thy parents haue laid vpon thee, if thou should'st
be disobedient vnto me, that yet a while thou continue heere, and
serue this thy Master which thou hast gotten thee, till thou hearest
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7594:20"/>
further from mee, but not with that foolish loyalty, and ignorant
honesty, as hitherto thou hast done; thinking to finde firmenesse
vpon a false foundation, as most of these Masters now a daies are.
But doe thou gaine friends, which is a durable and lasting commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;
sticke closely and constantly vnto them; doe not thou liue
vpon hopes, relying on the vaine promises of Masters, who sucke
away the substance of their seruants, with hollow-hearted, and idle
promises, as the horse-leaches suck bloud; and in the end fall off
from them, wrong them, grow forgetfull of their good seruices, and
deny them any recompence or reward at all. Wo be vnto him that
growes old in Court. The Masters of these times loue more them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
then their seruants; neither in so doing doe they doe amisse.
The like loue ought seruants to beare vnto themselues. Liberality
was lost long agoe; rewards are growne out of date; magnificence
is fled the countrie; and with her, all noblenesse. Euery one of
them is wholly now for himselfe, and makes the best hee can of his
seruants seruice, seruing his turne, as hee findes it may stand with
his priuate interest and profit. And therefore they ought to doe
no lesse, sithens that they are lesse then they in substance, but to liue
after their law, and to doe as they doe. My sonne <hi>Parmeno,</hi> I the
rather tell thee this, because thy Master (as I am informed) is (as
it seemeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> likewise vnto mee) a <hi>Rompenecios,</hi> one that befooles his
seruants, and weares them out to the very stumps, lookes for much
seruice at their hands, and makes them small, or no recompence:
He will looke to be serued of all, but will part with nothing at all.
Weigh well my words, and perswade thy selfe, that what I haue
said is true: Get thee some friends in his house, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
and preciousest Iewell in the world. For, with him thou must
not thinke to fasten friendship. A thing seldome seene, where there
is such difference of estate and condition, as is betweene you two.
Opportunity, thou seest, now offers her selfe vnto vs, on whose fore-top,
if wee will but take hold, wee shall all of vs be great gainers,
and thou shalt presently haue something, wherewithall to help thy
selfe. As for that which I told you of, it shall bee well and safely
kept, when time shall serue; in the meane while, it shall be much
for thy profit, that thou make <hi>Sempronio</hi> thy friend.</p>

                  <p>My mother (I see) is angry; and what I were best to do, I
know not. I am doubtfull of following her councell: it is as great an
errour to beleeue nothing, as it is to beleeue euery thing. The more
humane and ciuill courie is, to haue affiance and confidence in her.
Especially in that, where besides the present benefit, both profit
and pleasure is proposed. I haue heard tell; that a man should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
his betters, and those whose yeers carry authority with them.
Now; What is it she aduiseth me vnto? To be at peace with <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronio:</hi>
and to peace, no man ought to be opposite. For blessed are
the peacefull. Loue and charity towards our brethren, that is not
to be shunned and auoided by vs; and few are they, that will forgoe
their profit. I will therefore seeke to please her, and hearken vnto
her. Mother, a master ought not be offended with his Schollers
ignorance; at least, very seldome in matters of depth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
For though knowledge in its owne nature, be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnto all, yet is it infused but into few. And therefore I pray par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me, and speake a new vnto me; For, I will not only heare and
beleeue thee, but receiue thy councell as a singular kindnesse, and a
token of thy great fauour, and especiall loue towards mee. Nor
yet would I, that you should thanke mee for this; Because the
praise and thankes of euery action, ought rather to be attributed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7594:22"/>
to the giuer then to the receiuer. Command mee therefore; for
to your commandements shall I euer be willing, that my consent
submit it selfe.</p>

thosee thicke clouds, which darkened thy eye-sight, and hast answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
mee according to the wisedome, discretion, and sharpe wit of
thy father, whose person, now representing it selfe fresh to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
doth make my tender eyes to melt into teares, which
thou feest in such abundance to trickle downe my cheeks. He some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
would maintaine hard and strange propositions, but would
presently (such was the goodnesse of his nature) see his errour, and
imbrace the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I sweare vnto thee; that in thus seeing thee to

person, how able in his actions, what a part did he beare, and what
a venerall and reuerend countenance did hee carry! But hush, I
heare <hi>Calisto</hi> comming, and thy new friend, <hi>Sempronio,</hi> whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement

doth much exceed the greatnesse of your gift. And questionlesse,
a kindnesse that is quickely conferr'd, redoubles it's effect; for hee

                  <p>Yes Sir, exceeding well. For, besides, the
sauing of your life, you haue gained much honour by
it. And for what end is fortune fauourable and prosperous, but to be
a handmaide to our honour, and to wayte thereon, which of all
worldly goods is the greatest? For honor is the reward and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of vertue; and for this cause wee giue it vnto the Diuine
Essence, because wee haue not any thing greater to giue him.
The best part whereof consisteth in liberality and bounty: and
this close-fistednes, and vncommunicated treasure, doth eclypse and
darken, whereas magnificence and liberality doth gaine, and highly
extoll it. What good is it for a man to keep that to himselfe, which
in the keeping of it, does himselfe no good? I tell you, Sir, and what
I speake is truth; Better is the vse of riches, then the possessing of
them. O, how glorious a thing is it to giue? and how miserable to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7594:23"/>
receiue? See, how much better action is then passion: so much
more noble is the giuer, then the receiuer. Amongst the Elements,
the fire, because it is more actiue, is the more noble: and therefore
placed in the Spheares, in the noblest place. And some say; that
noblenesse is a praise proceeding from the merit, and antiquity of
our Ancesters. But I am of opinion, that another mans light can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
make you shine, vnlesse you haue some of your owne. And
therefore doe not glory in the noblenesse of your father, who was so
magnificent a Gentleman, but in your owne. Shine not out of his,
but your owne light; and so shall you get your selfe honour, which
is mans greatest outward good. Wherefore not the bad, but
the good, (such as your selfe) are worthy to partake of so perfect
a vertue. And besides, I must tell you, that perfect vertue doth not
suppose that Honour hath it's fellow: and therefore reioce with
your selfe, that you haue beene so magnificent, and so bountifull.
And thus, Sir, hauing told you my minde, let mee now aduise you
that you would be pleased to returne backe to your chamber, and
there take some rest, sithence, that your businesse is deposited in
such hands; assuring your selfe, that the beginning being so good,
the end will be much better: and so let vs goe presently to your
chamber; where I shall treate more at large with you concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this businesse.</p>

                  <p>Me thinkes (<hi>Sempronio</hi>) it is no good counsell, that I
shouldest heere accompanied, and that shee should goe all alone,
who seekes to cure my ill: it were better that thou shouldst goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with her, and hasten her on, since thou knowst, that on her dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
dependeth my well-fare; on her slownesse, my painfulnesse,
on her neglect, my despaire. Thou art wise, I know thee to bee
faithfull, I hold thee a good seruant. And therefore so handle the
matter, that she shall no sooner see thee, but that shee may iudge of
that paine which I feele, and of that fire which tormenteth mee;
whose extreme heat will not giue me leaue to lay open vnto her the
third part of my secret sickenesse. So did it tye my tongue, and
tooke such hold on my sences, that they were not onely busied, but
in a manner wasted and consumed; which thou, as one that is free
from the like passion, maist more largely deliuer, letting thy words
runne with a looser reyne.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I would faine goe to fulfill your command: And
I would fayne stay, to ease you of your care; your feare puts spurs
to my sides; and your solitarinesse, like a bridle, pulls mee backe.
But I will obey and follow your councell; which is, to goe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
the old woman. But how shall I goe? For, if I leaue you thus
all alone, you will talke idlely, like one that is distracted; doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but sigh, weepe, and take on, shutting your selfe vp in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
desiring solitude, and seeking new meanes of thoughtfull tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
wherein if you still perseuere, you cannot escape either death
or madnesse. For the auoyding whereof, get some good company
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7594:24"/>
about you, that may minister vnto you occasion of mirth, by recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of witty conceits, by intertaining you with Musicke, and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
merry songs, by relating Stories, by deuising Motto's, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
tales, by playing at cards, iesting, sporting. In a word, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting
any other kinde of sweet and delightfull recreation, for to
passe away the time, that you may not suffer your thoughts to run
still wandring on in that cruell errour, whereinto they were put

of vs gained, but was faithfully and truly diuided betweene
vs. Had shee liued, I should neuer haue liued to be deceiued. But
it was not my fortune to be so happy, shee dy'd too soone for mee.
O death, death, how many doest thou depriue of their sweete and
pleasing society! How many doest thou discomfort with thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome

ripe, thou croppest a thousand that are greene; For were shee
aliue, these my steps should not haue beene vnaccompanied, not
driuen (as now I am) to walke the streets alone. I haue good cause
to remember her; for to me shee was a faithfull friend, and a good
companion. And whilest shee was with me; she would neuer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
mee to trouble my body, or my braines about any thing: if I
brought bread, shee would bring meate; if I did spread the cloth,
she would lay the napkins: she was not foolish, nor fantasticall, nor
proud, as most of your women now adaies are. And by my say,
I sweare vnto thee, shee would goe barefaced from one end of the

And I dare be bold to say it, that there was not a woman of a
better palate for wine in the world, nor better skill'd in any kind of
marchandize whatsoeuer. And when you haue thought that she had
been scarce out of doores, with a whip-Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> e'r you could scarce
say this, shee was heere againe. Euery one would inuite and feast
her, so great was the affection which they bare vnto her; And
she neuer came home, till she had taken a taste of some eight or ten
sorts of wine, bearing one pottle in her Iar, and the other in her bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and her credit was so good, that they would haue trusted her for
a Rundlet or two vpon her bare word, as if shee had pawned vnto
them a piece of plate. Why, her word was as currant as gold, in all
the Innes and Tauernes in the Towne. If wee walked the streetes,
whensoeuer we found our selues thirsty, we entred streight the next
Tauerne that was at hand, and called presently for a quart of wine
for to moysten our mouthes withall, though we had not a penny to
pay for it. Nor would they (as from others) take our vailes and our
coyfes from off our heads, till we had discharged the reckoning, but

thinke for the present, I will plainely deliuer vnto thee. <hi>Melibea</hi>
is faire; <hi>Calisto</hi> fond and frank; he cares not to spare his purse, nor
I my paines; hee is willing to spend, and I to speed him in his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse;
Let his money be stirring, and let the suite hang as long
as it will. Money can doe any thing; it splitteth hard Rocks; it
passeth ouer Riuers dry-foote; there is not any place so high,
whereunto an Asse laden with gold will not get vp; his vnaduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and feruentnesse of affection, is sufficient to marre him, and to
make vs. This I haue thought vpon; this I haue searcht into; this
is all I know concerning him and her: and this is that which must
make most for our profit. Well, now must I goe to <hi>Pleberio's</hi> house.
<hi>Sempronio,</hi> fare-well. For though <hi>Melibea</hi> braue it, and stands so high
vpon her pantofles; yet is not shee the first that I haue made to
stoope, and leaue her cackling; they are all of them ticklish, and
skittish; the whole generation of them is giuen to winching &amp; flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging:
but after they are well weyghed, they prooue good high-way
Iades, and trauell quietly; you may kill them, but neuer tyre them.
If they iourney by night, they wish it may neuer be morning. They
curse the Cockes, because they proclaime it is day: the Clockes,
because they go too fast: they lye prostrate, as if they lookt after the
Pleyades and the North star, making themselues Astronomers, and
starre gazers; But when they see the morning starre arise, they sigh
for sorrow, and are ready to forsake their bodies. And the clearing
of the day, is the clouding of their ioy. And aboue all, it is worth
the while, to note how quickely they change copy, and turne the
Cat in the pan; They intreat him, of whom they were intreated;
they indure torment for him, whom before they had tormented;
they are seruants to those, whose Mistresses they were; they breake
thorow stone walls, they open windowes, feyne sicknesse; if the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of their doores chance to creake, they anoynt and supple them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7594:28"/>
with oyle, that they may performe their office without any noyse.
I am not able to expresse vnto thee the great impression of that
sweetnesse, which the primary and first kisses of him they loue, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
imprinted in their hearts. They are enemies of the meane, and
wholly set vpon extremes.</p>

much, of whom she is beloued, so that, if she entertaine not his loue,
she cannot dissemble her hate; there are no reynes strong inough
to bridle their dislike. And because I know this to be true, it makes
mee goe more merrily and cheerefully to <hi>Melibea's</hi> house, then if I
had her fast in my fist already. For I know, that though at the first
I must be forced to woo her, yet in the end, she will be glad to sue to

                  <p>Now that I am all alone, I will, as I walke

feared, concerning my trauell in this businesse. For,
those things which are not well weighed, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
though sometimes they take good effect, yet
commmonly fall out ill. So that much speculation brings foorth
much good fruit; for although I dissembled with him, and did set
a good face on the matter, it may be, that if my drift and intent
should chance to be found out by <hi>Melibea's</hi> father, it would cost
me little lesse then my life: Or at least, if they should not kill me,
I should rest much impaired in my credit, either by their tossing me
in a blanket, or by causing me to be cruelly whipt; so that my sweet

                     </gap> into what a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
haue I put my selfe? What a trap am I like to fall into, through
mine owne folly? For that I might shew my selfe solicitous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
I haue put my selfe vpon the hazard of the dice. Wo is me;
what shall I doe? To goe backe, is not for my profit; and to goe
on, stands not with my safety. Shall I persist? or shall I desist? In
what a straite am I? In what a doubtfull and strange perplexity?
I know not which I were best to choose. On my daringnesse depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
manifest danger; on my cowardize shamefull damage. Which
way shall the Oxe goe, out he must needs plough? Euery way, goe
which way I will, discouers to my eyes deepe and dangerous fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes;
desperate downefalls; if I be taken in the manner; if the
theft be found about me, I shall be either kill'd, or carted, with a
paper-crowne set vpon my head, hauing my fault written in great
Text-letters. But in case I should not goe, what will <hi>Sempronio</hi> then
say? Is this all thou canst doe? Thy power, thy wisedome, thy
stoutnesse, thy courage, thy large promises, thy faire offers, thy
tricks, thy subtilties, &amp; the great care (forsooth) thou wouldst take;
What? are they all come to this? And his Master <hi>Calisto,</hi> what will
he say? what will hee doe? or what will hee thinke? saue onely
this; That there is much deceit in my steps; and that I haue disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
this blot to <hi>Pleberio,</hi> like a preuaricating Sophistresse, or cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Ambi-dexter, playing the traitour on both sides, that I might
gaine by both? And if he doe not entertaine so hatefull a thought,
he will raile vpon me like a mad-man; he will vpbraid mee to my
face, with most reproachful termes; He will propose a thousand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences,
which my hasty deliberation was the cause of; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Out you old whore; Why didst thou increase my passions
with thy promises? False Bawd as thou art; For all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
thy feete can walke, for mee onely thy tongue; Others can
haue works; I only words. Others can haue remedy at thy hands;
I onely the man that must endure torment. To all others, thy force
can extend it selfe; and to me is it only wanting. To all others thou
art Light; to me Darkenesse. Out thou old tretcherous, disloyall
wertike; Why didst thou offer thy selfe and seruice vnto me? For,
it was thy offer that did put mee in hope: and that hope did delay
my death, prolonged my life, and did put vpon mee the Title of a
glad man. Now, for that thy promises haue not prou'd effectuall,
neither shalt thou want punishment, nor I wofull despaire: so that,
looke I on which side I will (miserable man that I am) it is ill here,
and it is ill there; paine &amp; griefe on either hand: But when extremes
shall want their meane, and no meanes to auoide either the one or
the other; of two cuils, it is the wiser course to incline to the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.
And therefore I had rather offend <hi>Pleberio,</hi> then displease <hi>Calisto.</hi>
Well then, I will goe. For greater will my shamebe, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for a Coward, then my punishment, in daring to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
what I promised. Besides, Fortune still friendeth those that

wanting for the mitigating, and allaying of punishment. All Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations

proceedings; or else I am no body in this my Art, a meere bungler,
an Idiot, an Asse. Of foure men that I meete by the way, three of

                  <p>My good Lady; All blessings abide with you, and your noble
daughter. My many griefes and infirmities haue hindred my visiting
of this your house, as in duty I was bound to doe; But heauen
knowes how faire are the intralls of my inward affection, how free
from any spot of foulnesse. It knowes the sincerity of my heart, and
trunesse of my loue. For, distance of place displaceth not that loue,
which is lodged in the heart: So that what heeretofore in my selfe
I did much desire, now my necessity hath made mee to performe.
And amongst other my many Crosses and miseries in this life, my
Crosses in my purse grow dayly lesse and lesse; so that I haue no

better remedy to helpe my selfe withall, and to relieue this my
poore estate, then to sell this little parcell of yarne of mine owne
spinning to make Coyfes, and Kerchiefes; and vnderstanding by
your maid, that you had need thereof (howbeit I am poore in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, I praise my fate, saue the richnesse of this grace) it is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at your command, if either it or I may doe you any seruice.</p>

not able to match it. Looke well vpon it; it is as fine as the haire of
your head, euen and equall, as nothing more strong, as the strings of
a Viall; white as a flake of Snow, spun all with mine owne fingers;
reeled and wound vp with mine owne hands. Looke you (Lady)

                  <p>They desire so much their more hurt; they desire so
much their more griefe; they desire to liue to be old; because by
liuing to be old, they liue. And life (you know) is sweete; and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
they come to be old. Hence is it, that your children desire to
be men; and your men to be old men; and your old men, to be
more and more old; and though they liue in neuer so much paine,
yet doe they still desire to liue. For, (as it is in the Prouerbe) Faine
would the Henne liue, for all her pip; she would not be put out of
her life, to be put out of her paine. But who is hee (Lady) that can
recount vnto you the inconueniences of old age? The discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
it brings with it? it's torments, it's cares, it's troubles, it's
infirmities, it's colds, it's heates, it's discontentments, it's brawles,
it's janglings, it's griefes, which like so many weights lye heauy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it? Those deepe furrows and deepe wrinkles in the face? That
change and alteration in the hayre? That fading of fresh and liuely
colour? That want of hearing? That weaknesse of sight? That
hollownesse in the eyes? Seeing, as if they were shut vp in a
shade? That sinking and falling of the iawes? That toothlesnesse
of the gummes? That failingnesse of force and of strength? That
feeblenesse of legs? That slownesse in feeding? Besides, (Madame)
which makes mee sigh to thinke vpon it, when all these miseries I
haue told you of, come accompanied with pouerty, all sorrowes to
this must stoope and strike saile, when the appetite shall be great,
and the prouision small; The stomack good, and the dyet naught;
For I neuer knew any worse habit, then that of hunger.</p>

                  <p>Daughter, and Mistresse, there is no way so faire, but
hath some foule; if you haue one mile of good, you haue three of
bad. At the foote of euery hill, you haue three Leagues of ill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
And of a thousand that liue contentedly, you haue ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
doe the contrary: True contentednesse, rest, renowne, glory,
and quietnesse, runne from the rich by other by-conduits, and gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of subtilty and deceit; which pipes, whereby they are conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are neuer perceiued, because they are paued and brickt ouer
with smooth and well wrought flatteries. He is rich that hath Gods
blessing. I mary, that is wealth indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And shall I tell you, Lady?
Safer it is with him that is despised, then with him that is feared.
And a farre better sleepe doth the poore man take, then hee who is
bound to keepe that with care which hee hath gotten with labour,
and must leaue with sorrow. My friend will not dissemble with
me, but the rich mans will with him; I am loued for mine owne
sake; the rich man for his wealths sake. A rich man shall neuer
heare the truth; euery one will flatter him, and seeke to please his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in whatsoeuer he shall say. Besides, he lies open to euery mans
enuy; and you shall scarce finde one rich man amongst a thousand,
but will ingeniously confesse, that it had beene better for him to
haue bin in a middling estate, or in good honest pouerty. For riches
make not a man rich but busied; not a Master, but a Steward. More
are they that are possessed by their riches, then they that possesse
their riches. To many they haue beene a meanes of their death; and
most men they haue rob'd of their pleasure, and their good and
commendable qualities; and to say the truth, they are enemies to
all goodnesse. Haue you not heard say, Men haue lien downe,
and dream'd of their riches, and behold, they haue waked, and found
nothing in their hands? Euery rich man hath a dozen of sonnes, or
Nephewes, which repeate no other prayer, nor tender any other
Orison to God, but that he would be pleased to take him out of this
world; and desire nothing more, then to see the houre that they
may come to enioy his estate; to see him vnder ground, and what
was his, in their hands; and with a small charge, to lay him vp in
his last and euerlasting mansion heere on earth.</p>

For all those things, whose possession is no whit pleasing, it is better
to inioy them as they are, then to desire their longer stay. For then
are they so much the neerer to their end, by how much the farther
they are from their beginning. Nor is there any thing in the world
more sweet, or more pleasing to him that is truely weary, then his
Inne, wherein hee may rest himselfe. So that though youth be a

                  <p>My wants, Madame? My necessities doe you meane?
Nay, others (as I told you) not mine. For mine owne, I passe at
home with my selfe in mine owne house, without letting the whole
Country to know them: Eating when I may, and drinking when I
can get it. For, for all my pouerty, I neuer wanted a penny to buy
me bread, nor <hi>a Quarte,</hi> that is, the eighth part of sixe pence to send
for wine, no, not in all this time of my widdow-hood. For before,
I neuer tooke thought for any, but had alwaies a good Vessell still in
my house. And when one was empty, another was full. I neuer
went to bed, but I did first eat a toast well steept in wine, and two
dozen of draughts, sipping still the wine after euery sop, for feare of
the Mother, wherwith I was then wont to be troubled. But now, that
I husband all things my self, and am at mine own finding, I am faine
to fetch my wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e in a little poore Iarre, which will scarce hold a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>le.
And sometimes in punishment of my sinnes (which Crosse I am
willing to beare) I am forced to goe sixe times a day with these my
siluer hayres about my shoulders, to fill and fetch my wine my selfe
at the Tauerne. Nor would I by my good will dye, till I see my
selfe haue a good Rundlet or Terse of mine owne within mine
owne dootes. For (on my life) there is no prouision in the world
like vnto it. For as the saying is; It is bread and wine, not the
young man that is spruce and fine, that makes vs rid the way, and
trauell with mettle; yet let me tell you, that where the good man is
missing, all other good is wanting. For ill does the spindle mooue,
when the beard does not wagge aboue. And this I thought good to
tell you by the way, vpon those speeches which I vsed concerning
others, and not mine owne necessities.</p>

thy mind vnto me in plaine termes. On the one side thou dost
anger me, and prouoke mee to displeasure; on the other thou doest
moue and stirre me to compassion. Neither know I how to returne
thee a conuenient answer, because I haue not fully comprehended
thy meaning; I should thinke my selfe happy, if my words might
carry that force, as to saue the life of any man, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

Besides, he that doth a benefit, receiues it when it is done to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

it, is guilty of his death; and therefore giue not ouer thy petition,

                  <p>All feare fled (faire Lady) in beholding your beauty
For, I cannot be perswaded, that Nature did paint in vaine one
face fairer then another, more inrich't with grace and fauour,
more fashionable, and more beautifull then another; were it not to
make them Magazines of vertue, mansions of mercy, houses of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
and pitie, Ministers of her blessings, and dispensers of
those good gifts and graces, which in her bounty shee hath
bestowed vpon them, and vpon your selfe in a more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
manner. Besides, sithence wee are all mortall, and borne to
dye; as also, that it is most certaine, that hee cannot bee said
truely to be borne, who is onely borne for himselfe; for then
should men be like vnto bruite beasts, (if not worse;) Amongst
which, there are some, that are very pitifull: as your Vnicorne, of
whom it is reported, that hee will humble and prostrate himselfe
at the feet of a Virgin. And your dogge, for all his fiercenesse, and
cruelnesse of nature, when hee comes to bite another, if hee throw
himselfe downe at his feet, hee will let him alone, and doe him no
harme; and this is all out of pitie. Againe, to come to your birds,
and fowles of the ayre; your Cocke eateth not any thing, but hee
first calleth his Hens about him, and giues them part of his feeding.
The Pellicane, with her beake breaketh vp her owne brest, that she
may giue her very bowels and intrals to her young ones to eat. The
Storkes maintaine their aged parents as long in the nest, as they did
giue them food, when they were young and vnable to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Now, if God and Nature gaue such knowledge vnto beasts
and birds; why should wee that are men, be more cruell one to
another? Why giue we not part of our graces, and of our persons,
to our neighbors? Especially when they are inuolued and afflicted
with secret infirmities, and those such, that where the Medicine is,
thence was the cause of the maladie?</p>

I do it more to adde health to the Patient, then to detract any thing

This is hee who saw mee the other day, and beganne to court mee

(good old woman) if hee thinke that I was wholy his, and that he
had wonne the field, because it pleased me rather to consent to his
folly, then correct his fault, and yeeld to his errand, then chastise
his errour; that I was willing rather to let him goe like a foole as
hee came, then to publish this his presumptuous enterprize. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
aduise him, that the next way to haue his sicknesse leaue him,
is to leaue off his louing, and wholy to relinquish his purpose, if he
purpose to impart health to himselfe; which if he refuse to doe, tell
him from mee, that he neuer bought words all the daies of his life
at a dearer rate. Besides, I would haue him know, that no man is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome,

and he contented. But it is euermore the nature of fooles, to thinke
other like themselues. Returne thou with this very answer vnto
him; for other answer of me shall he none, nor neuer hope for any:
for it is but in vaine to intreat mercy of him, of whom thou canst not
haue mercy. And for thine owne part, thou maist thanke God, that

                  <p>Mary, a certaine Charme, Madame, which (as hee is
informed by many of his good friends) your Ladiship hath,
which cureth the tooth-ache; as also that same admirable Girdle
of yours, which is reported to haue beene found and brought from
<hi>Cumae</hi> the Caue there, and was worne, 'tis thought, by the Sibilla, or
Prophetesse of that place; which Girdle they say, hath such a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and peculiar property and power, with the very tutch to
abate and ease any ache or anguish whatsoeuer. Now this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
I told you of, is exceedingly pained with the tooth-ache, and
euen at deaths doore with it. And this was the true cause of my
comming: But since it was my ill hap to receiue so harsh and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
an answer, let him still for me continue in his paine, as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
due vnto him, for sending so vnfortunate a messenger. For
since in that muchnesse of your vertue I haue found much of your
pity wanting; I feare mee, hee would also want water, should he
send mee to the Sea to fetch it. And you know (sweet Lady) that

                     </gap>o due and conuenient a preamble as I
should haue done, it was, because truth needeth no colours. The
very compassion that I had of his paine, and the confidence of your
magnificency, did choake in my mouth, when I first beganne to
speake the expression of the cause. And for that you know (Lady)
that sorrow workes turbation, and turbation doth disorder and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the tongue, which ought alwaies to be ty'de to the braine; for
heauens loue, lay not the fault on me; and if he hath committed an
errour, let not that redound to my hurt; for I am no farther blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of any fault, then as I am the messenger of the faulty. Breake
not the rope where it is weakest. Be not like the Cobweb, which
neuer shewes it's force, but on poore little Flyes. No humane Law
condemnes the father for the sonnes offence, nor the sonne for the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7594:36"/>
fathers: nor indeed (Lady) is it any reason, that his presumption
should occasion my perdition; though considering his desert, I
should not greatly care, that hee should be the delinquent, and my
selfe be condemned, since that I haue no other Trade to liue by, saue
to serue such as hee is; This is my occupation, this I make my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.
Yet withall (Madame) I would haue you to conceiue, that
it was neuer in my desire to hurt one, to helpe another, though
behind mybacke, your Ladiship hath perhaps been otherwise infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

that can blast the truth; assuredly I meane nothing in this, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and best remedy he hath, is, to take his Viall, whereto hee sings so
many songs, &amp; in such dolefull notes, that I verily beleeue, they did
farre exceed those, which that great Emperor and Musician <hi>Hadrian</hi>
composed concerning the soules departure from the body; the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to endure without dismayment, his approaching death. For
though I haue but little skill in musicke, me thinks he makes the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
when he plaies thereon, to speake; and when hee sings thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
the birds with a better will listen vnto him, then to that Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
of old, which made the trees and stones to moue. Had he been
borne then, <hi>Orpheus</hi> had lost his prey. Weigh then with your selfe
(Sweet Lady) if such a poore old woman as I am, haue not cause to
count my selfe happy, if I may giue life vnto him, to whom the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
haue giuen so many graces? Not a woman that sees him, but
praiseth Natures workemanship, whose hand did draw so perfect a
piece; and if it bee their hap to talke with him, they are no more
mistresses of themselues, but are wholy at his disposing; and of
Commanders, desire to be commanded by him. Wherfore, seeing I

haue so great reason to doe for him, conceiue (good Lady) my
purpose to be faire and honest, my courses commendable, and free
from suspicion and iealousie.</p>

                  <p>I intreated her to put your Ladiship in minde of the
Charme, that it might be writ out ready for mee; and that shee
should learne of mee to temper her selfe in the time of your anger,
putting her in mind of that ancient Adage; From an angry man,
get thee gone but for a while; but from an enemy, for euer. But you
(Madame) had onely a quarell to those words of mine which you
suspected, and not any enmity to my person. And say, they had bin
such as you conceited them; yet were they not so bad, as you
would haue made them to be. For it is euery daies experience, to see
men pain'd &amp; tormented for women; and women as much for men.
And this, Nature worketh; and Nature (you know) is crafts master,
and works nothing that is ill: So that my demand (you see) was
(as my desire was it should be) in it selfe commendable, as having
it's growth from so good a root. Many the like reasons could I
render you, were not prolixity tedious to the hearer, and hurtfull
to the speaker.</p>

                  <p>It is so now with mee; But how much more had a man

                  <p>No. But rather grew thereby the bolder to vtter my
minde vnto her; it was the thing that I desired; it was euen as I
would haue wisht it: There was nothing could haue fell out so pat
for me, as to see my selfe all alone with her: then beganne I to open
the very bowels and intralls of my heart; then did I deliuer my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage,
and told her in what extreme paine you liued, and how
that one word of her mouth, proceeding fauourably from her,
would ease you of your mighty torment. And as one standing in
suspence, looking wisely and steadily vpon me, somewhat amazed
at the strangenesse of my message, hearkning very attentiuely, till
shee might come to know who this should be, that for want of a
word of her mouth, liu'd in such great paine, and what manner of
man he might be, whom her tongue was able to cure? In naming
you vnto her, she did cut off my words, and with her hand strooke
her selfe a blow on the brest, as one that had heard some strange and
fearefull newes; charging mee to cease my prattle, and to get mee
out of her sight, vnlesse I would her seruants should become my Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners,
and make short worke with me in these my old and latter
dayes; aggrauating my audacious boldnesse; calling mee Witch,
Sorceresse, Bawd, old Whore, false Baggage, bearded Miscreant, the
Mother of mischiefe; and many other more ignominious names,
wherewithall they feare children. And when she had ended with
her Bugge-beares, shee beganne to fall into often swownings and
trances, making many strange gestures, full of feare and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
all her senses being troubled, her bloud boyling within her,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7594:44"/>
throwing her selfe this way and that way, bearing in a strange kind
of manner the members of her body one against another; and then
in a strong and violent fashion, being wounded with that golden
shaft, which at the very voycing of your name, had struck her to the
heart, writhing and winding her body, her hands and fingers being
clinched one within another, like one struggling &amp; striuing for life,
that you would haue thought, shee would haue rent them asunder,
hurling and rowling her eyes on euery side, striking the hard
ground with her tender feete. Now, I all this while, stood me still
in a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

could for my life, not saying so much as any one word vnto her; yet
glad with all my heart, to see her in this cruell and pittifull taking.
And the more her throwes and pangs were, the more did I laugh
in my sleeue at it; because I thereby knew, her yeelding would be
the sooner, and her fall the neerer: yet must I tell you, that whil'st
her anger did foame out it's froth, I did not suffer my thoughts to be
idle, nor giue them leaue to runne a wooll-gathering, but recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
my selfe, and calling my wits about mee, I tooke hold on
Times fore-top, and found a salue to heale that hurt, which my

                  <p>Deare mother, thou hast told me that, which whil'st I was
hearing thee, I had fore-casted in mine owne iudgement, I did still
dreame it would come to this; but I doe not see how thou couldst
light vpon a fit excuse, that might serue the turne, and proue good
inough to couer and colour the suspition of thy demand; though I
know, that thou art exceeding wise, and in all that thou dost (to
my seeming) more then a woman. Sithence, that as thou didst prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticate
her answer, so didst thou in time prouide thee of thy reply.
What could that Tuscane Champion (so much famoused thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

beene liuing) had beene quite lost; who three daies before shee dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
diuined of the death of her old husband, and her two sonnes.
Now doe I beleeue that, which is so commonly spoken; that a
woman is neuer to seeke for an answer; and though it be the weaker
Sexe, yet is their wit more quicke and nimble then that of men.</p>

                  <p>Now the Diuell goe with him, with what an ill will does
he goe? I thinke there is not any man liuing so ill seru'd as I am;
maintaining men that deuise nothing but mischiefe, murmurers,
grudgers of my good, repiners of my prosperity, and enemies to my
happinesse. Thou Villaine, what goest thou mumbling to thy selfe?
Thou enuious wretch, what is that thou sayst? for I vnderstand thee
not. Doe as I command you, you were best, and that quickely too.
Get you gone with a murraine, and vexe mee no more, for I haue
griefe inough already to bring me to my graue. There will as much
of the piece be left (which remnant you may take for your selfe) as
will serue to make you a Ierkin.</p>

morrow; and for you (mother) let me intreat you out of your loue
to me, to haue patience vntill then; for that is not auferred, which is
but deferred. Now I pray let me see that glorious girdle, which was
held so worthy to ingirt so goodly a body, that these my eyes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the rest of my senses, may enioy so great a happinesse,
since that together, they haue all of them beene a little affected with
passion. My afflicted heart shall also reioyce therein, which hath
not had one minute of delight, since it first knew that Lady. All my
senses haue beene wounded by her, all of them haue brought whole
basket-fulls of trouble to my heart. Euery one of them hath vexed
and tormented it all they could; the eyes, in seeing her; the
eares in hearing her; and the hands in touching her.</p>

him from forth the common street, no, nor any to couer him, saue

thy next daies torment. Be of good courage, Sir. Plucke vp your

and worth in thee, as to hedge in that body, and be its inclosure,
which my selfe am not worthy to serue. O yee knots of my passion,
it is you that haue intangled my desires; Tell me, if thou wert pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at that vncomfortable answer of fairest she, whom thou seruest,
and I adore. And yet the more I torment my selfe for her sake,
mourning and lamenting night and day, the lesse it auailes mee, and

gets most. But I will make thee by thy labouring, to obtaine that
which by being negligent, thou shouldst neuer atchieue. For <hi>Camora</hi>

walled in with stones; and stones by stones are easily ouer-throwne.
But this my deare Lady hath her heart inuironed with steele; there
is no mettle that can preuaile against her; no shot of that force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to
make a breach: and should Ladders bee reared to scale the walls,
shee hath eyes which let flye darts of repulsion, and a tongue which
dischargeth whole volleis of reproches, if you once approach, force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you to stand farther off, and so inaccessible is her Castle, that
you cannot come neere it by halfe a league.</p>

and yet beleeue it not. O girdle, girdle, thou louely lace! Wast
thou mine enemy too? Tell me the truth; if thou wert, I forgiue
thee: For it is proper vnto good men, to forgiue; but I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it. For hadst thou likewise beene my foe, thou wouldst not

ouerthrow both thy life and vnderstanding; either of
which to want, is sufficient to leaue you darkling, and say good

                  <p>Howbeit they be not, yet should you not talke thus

Vse a girdle like a girdle, that you may know to make a difference
of your words, when you come to <hi>Melibea's</hi> presence; let not your

Let mee glad my selfe a little with this messenger of my

any other discourse? leauing off to adore that present Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
which, peraduenture, thou shalt neuer see in thy power?
O yee my hands! With what presumption, with what slender reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
doe you touch that Treacle, which must cure my wound?
Now that poyson cannot hurt mee, wherewith that cruell shot of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7594:46"/>
                     <hi>Cupid</hi> hath it's sharpe point deepely indipped. For now I am safe,
since that shee who gaue mee my wound, giues mee also my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.
O deare <hi>Celestina!</hi> Thou that art the delight of all old Dames,
the ioy of young wenches, the ease of the afflicted, and comfort of
such comfortlesse wretches as my selfe; do not punish me more with
feare of thee, then I am already punished with shame of my selfe; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me to let loose the reines of my contemplation; giue me leaue to
goe foorth into the streets with this iewell, that they who see mee,
may know, that there is not any man more happy then my selfe.</p>

farreforth as shee is able) shee will be ready to yeeld you any helpe
for this infirmitie of yours, which I shall craue at her hands. And
tell me, I pray, if this bee not well for the first bowt. Well, I will

euer create a better, or more perfect body? Can the like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be painted by any pensill? Is she not that Paragon of beautie,
from whence all eyes may copy forth a true patterne of vnimitable

would haue done their reuerence to this Lady, for whom I lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish.
If she had been present in that contention for the Apple with
the three Goddesses, the name of contention had neuer been questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned:
For without any contradiction, they would all of them haue
yeelded, and ioyntly haue giuen their consent, that <hi>Melibea</hi> should
haue borne it from them: so that it should rather haue been called
the Apple of concord, then of discord. Besides, as many women as
are now borne, and doe know her, curse themselues and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
complaining of heauen, because it did not remember them,
when it made her, consuming as well their bodies as their liues with
enuy, being ready to eat their owne flesh for very anger, still aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
martyrdomes to themselues, thinking to equall that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
by arte, which Nature had bestowed vpon her without any
labour. They pill, and dis-haire their eye-browes with nippers,
with playsters of Pitch or Barme, and other the like instruments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
They seeke after Wall-wort, and the like hearbs, roots, sprigs, and
flowres to make Lyes, wherewithall to bring their haire to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of hers, spoyling and martyring their faces, clothing them with
diuers colourings, glissenings, paintings, vnctions, oyntments,
strong waters, white and red pargetings, which, to auoide prolixity,
I repeate not. Now iudge then, whether shee whom Nature hath
so richly beautified, be worthy the loue and seruice of so meane a

excellency of her Painter: only a little faire Fountaine-water with
a combe of yuorie, is sufficient (without any other slibber-slabbers)
to make her surpasse all other of her Sexe, in beauty and courtesie.
These are her weapons; with these she kils and ouer-comes; and
with these hath she bound mee in so hard and strong a chaine, that I

                     <hi>Parmeno,</hi> my sonne; since we last talkt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
I haue not had any fit opportunitie to
expresse vnto thee the infinitenesse of that loue
which I beare vnto thee, and as all the world can
well witnesse for mee, how well I haue spoken of
thee in thy absence. Euery man, eare hath beene
filled with the good reports I haue made of thee. The reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I need not to repeate; for I euer held thee to be my sonne, at
least, by adoption; and therefore thought thou wouldst haue shew'd
thy selfe more naturall and louing towards me. But in stead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
thou gau'st me bad payment, euen to my face; crossing, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
I said; thinking ill of all that I spake; whispering and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
against me in the presence of <hi>Calisto.</hi> I was well perswaded,
that after thou hadst once yeelded to my good counsell, that you
would not haue turned your heele, and kickt against me as you did,
nor haue falne off from your promise. But notwithstanding all this,
I perceiue some old relique yet still remaining of my former folly.
And so speaking rather to satisfie thine owne humor, then that thou
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nst render any reason for it; thou dost hinder thy selfe of profit,
to giue thy tongue contentment. Heare me (my sonne) if thou hast
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7594:48"/>
not heard me already. Looke I, say, and consider with thy selfe, that
I am old, and well strucken in yeeres; and good counsell only lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
with the elder sort, it being proper to youth, to follow pleasure
and delight. But my hope is, that of this thy errour, thy youth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is in fault: and I trust that you will beare your selfe better to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
mee heereafter, and that you will alter your ill purpose, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with your tender yeeres; For as it is in the Prouerbe: Our
customes suffer change, together with our hayres; and wee vary
our disposition, as we vary our yeeres. I speake this (my sonne) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as we grow in age, so grow we in experience; new things daily
offring themselues to our view: for youth lookes no farther then to
things present, occupying his eie only in that he sees set before him;
but riper yeeres omit neither things present, things past, nor things
to come. And sonne <hi>Parmeno,</hi> if you would but bethink your selfe of
the loue I haue heeretofore borne you, I know it cannot escape your
knowledge, that the first nights lodging that you tooke, when you
were a stranger, and came newly to this City, was in my house. But
you young men care not for vs that are old; but gouerne your selues
according to the sauour and relish of your owne palates; you neuer
think that you haue, or shall haue need of vs: you neuer thinke vpon
sicknesse; you neuer think, that this flowre of your youth shall fade.
But doe you heare me, (my friend) and marke what I say vnto you;
That in such cases of necessitie, as these, an old woman, (bee shee
well experienced) is a good helpe, a comforter, a friend, a mother;
nay, more then a mother: A good Inne, to giue ease and rest to a
sound man; and a good Hospitall for to cure a sicke man; a good
Purse in time of need; a good Chest, to keepe money in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
a good Fire in winter, inuironed with spits of good rost-meat;
a good Shade in summer, and a good Tauerne to eate and drinke in.
Now my pretty little foole, what sai'st thou to all this? What dost
thou thinke of it? I know, thou art by this time ashamed of that
which thou hast spoken to day; thou can'st not say B to a Battle-doore;
thou art strucke so dumbe, and so dead: and therefore I will
presse thee no further, nor craue any more at thy hands, then that
which friendship craues of thee, which is, Looke vpon <hi>Sempronio;</hi>
next vnder heauen, my selfe haue made him a man; I could wish you
would liue and loue together as brothers and friends: for being in
league with him, thou shalt liue in the fauor and loue of thy Master,
and in good repute with all the world: for <hi>Sempronio,</hi> I tell thee, is
well belou'd, hee is diligent, a good Courtier, a proper seruant, a
fellow of a good fashion, and one that is willing to imbrace thy
friendship, which will turne to both your profits, if you will but
hand-fast your affections each to other. Besides, you know, that
you must loue, if you will be beloued. Trowtes cannot bee taken
with drie breeches. And if the Cat will haue fish, she must wet her
foote. Nor does <hi>Sempronio</hi> owe this of right vnto thee; nor is hee
bound to loue thee, vnlesse thou exchange loue for loue: it is meere
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7594:49"/>
simplicitie, not to be willing to loue, and yet looke to be beloued of
others. And as great folly, to repay friendship with hatred.</p>

lesson, as if I had neuer knowne what it meant; I am (I confesse) the
man I was, nor is <hi>Sempronio</hi> himselfe; neyther can hee, nor will
hee stead mee in any thing. I neuer yet tasted any the least kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
from him.</p>

                  <p>A sure friend is knowne in a doubtfull matter; and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity
is his faith proued. Then comes he neerest vnto him, when
hee is farthest from comfort; and with greater desire doth
hee then visit his house, when as prosperous fortune hath forsaken
it. What shall I say vnto thee, Sonne, of the vertues of a good
and fast friend? There is nothing more to bee beloued; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more rare: he refuseth no burden. You two are equalls, and
paritie of persons, similitude of manners, and simpathy of hearts are
the maine props that vp-hold friendship. Take heed (my sonne;)
for if thou hast any thing, it is safely kept for thee. Be thou wise to
gaine more, for this is gain'd already to your hands. Your father,
O what paines tooke hee for it! But I may not put it into your

                  <p>Mary sonne, to liue of your selfe. Not to goe thorow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens houses, nor to set thy foote vnder another mans table:
which thou shalt still bee inforced to doe, vnlesse thou learne to
make profit of thy seruice; for out of very pitty to see thee goe thus
totred and torne, not hauing a ragge almost to hang on thy breeche,
did I beg that mantle which thou saw'st, of <hi>Calisto,</hi> not so much for
the mantles sake, as for that there being a Taylor belonging to the
house, and thou before being without a Ierkin, hee might bestow it
vpon thee. So that I speake not for mine owne profit, (as I heard
you say) but for thy good. For, if you rely onely vpon the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wages of these Gallants, it is such, that what you get by it after
tenne yeeres seruice, you may put it in your eye and neuer see the
worse. Inioy thy youth, good daies, good nights, good meate, and
good drinke; when thou mai'st haue these things, lose them not;
Let that be lost that will be lost. Doe not thou mourne for the
wealth which was left thy Master (for that will but shorten thy
daies) sithence wee can inioy it no longer then wee liue. O Sonne

                  <p>Sonne, no more. For mine eyes already runne
ouer, and my teares beginne to breake ouer those bankes, which
should bound them in. O! had I in all this world, but such
another friend? Such another companion? Such a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse
in my troubles? Such an easer, and lightner of my hearts hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse?
Who did supply my wants? Who knew my secrets?
To whom did I discouer my heart? Who was all my happinesse,
and quietnesse, but thy mother? She was neerer and dearer vnto me,
then my gossip, or mine owne sister. O! how well-fauored was she,
and cheerefull of countenance? How lustie? How quicke? How
neate? How portly and maiesticall in her gate? How stout and
manly? Why, shee would goe you at midnight without or paine,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7594:50"/>
or feare, from Church-yard, to Church-yard, seeking for imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
appertaining to our Trade, as if it had been day. Nor did she
omit either Christians, Moores, or Iewes, whose Graues and Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres
she did not visit. By day she would watch them, and by night
shee would dig them out; taking such things as should serue her
turne. So that she tooke as great pleasure in darknesse of the night,
as thou dost comfort in the brightnesse of the day. She would vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
say; that the night was the sinfull mans cloak, that did hide and
couer all his rogueries, that they might not be seene, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
she had not the like dexteritie and skill in all the rest of those
tricks that apperta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ined to her Trade: yet one thing shall I tell thee,
because thou shall see what a mother thou hast lost, though I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to keepe it in; but it makes no matter, it shall out to thee.
She did pull out seuen teeth out of a fellowes head that was hang'd,
with a paire of Pincers, such as you pull out stubbed haires withall;
whil'st I did pull off his shooes. She was excellent at a Circle, and
would enter it farre better then my selfe, and with greater boldnes,
though I also was very famous for it in those dayes, more I wisse,
then I am now; who haue together with her, lost almost my cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
What shall I say more vnto thee, but that the very Diuels
themselues did liue in feare of her? Shee did hold them in horrour,
and dread, making them to tremble and quake, when shee beganne
to exercise her exorcismes, her spels, her incantations, her charmes,
her coniurations, and other words of most horrisonous roaring, and
most hideous noyse. Shee was as well knowne to them all, as the
begger knowes his dish; or as thy selfe in thine owne house. One
Diuell comming tumbling in vpon the necke of another, as fast, as
it pleased her to call them vp, and not one of them durst tell her
a lye; such power had shee to binde them: so that euer since shee
dy'd, I could neuer attaine to the truth of any thing. <hi>Parmeno,</hi> may

Maides and Damsels, who did as earnestly pray for her life, as
for that of their owne fathers and mothers. Shee had to doe with
all manner of persons; shee talked with all sorts of people. If wee
walked the streetes, as many as we met, they were all of them her
God-sonnes. For her chiefest profession for some sixteene yeeres

                  <p>Mary I say, sonne, that besides this, your mother was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
foure seuerall times, shee her selfe alone: and once shee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
for a Witch; For shee was found one night by the watch,
with certaine little candles in her hand, gathering I know not what
earth in a crosse way; for which shee stood halfe a day in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
market-place vpon a Scaffold, with a high paper Hat, like the
coffin of a Suger-loafe, painted full of Diuels, whereon her fault was
written (being brought thither, riding thorow the streetes vpon an
Asse, as the fashion is in the punishment of Bawds &amp; Witches.) Yet
all this was nothing; for men must suffer something in this wicked
world, for to vp-hold their liues, and their honours. And marke, I
pray, what small reckoning they made of it, because of her great
wisdome and discretion. For shee would not for all this, giue ouer
her old occupation; and from that day forward followed it more
earnestly, then shee did before, and with happier proofe. This I
thought good to tell you, to crosse that opinion of yours, touching
perseuerance in that, wherein we haue once already erred; for all
that shee did, did so well become her, and such a grace had she with
her, that vpon my conscience, howbeit she stood thus disgracefully
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7594:51"/>
vpon the Scaffold, euery one might perceiue, that shee cared not a
button for those that stood beneath, staring and gazing vpon her;
such was her behauiour and carriage at that instant: looke they
might their fill, but I warrant you, she was not a farthing in debt, no
not to the proudest of them all; wherein, I thought fit to instance,
to shew thereby vnto you; that they, who haue any thing in them
as shee had, and are wise, and of worth, fall farre more easily and
sooner into errour, then any other. Doe but weigh and consider
with your selfe, what a manner of man <hi>Virgil</hi> was; how wise in all
kinde of knowledge; and yet I am sure you haue heard, how in a
wicker basket hee was hung out from a Towre, all <hi>Rome</hi> looking
vpon him; yet for all this, was hee neither the lesse honoured, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lost he the name of <hi>Virgil.</hi>

                  <p>Peace, you foole, thou art ignorant what a sinister and
course kinde of Iustice was vsed, and rigorously executed vpon thy
mother, to the most extremity, which, as all men confesse, is a
meere iniury. And the rather, because it was commonly spoken of
all men, that wrongfully, and against all right and reason, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning
of false witnesses, and cruell torments, they inforced her to
confesse that, which in realitie of truth was not. But because shee
was a woman of a great spirit, and good courage, and her heart had
beene accustomed to endure, shee made matters lighter then they
were; And of all this, shee reckoned not a Pinne: for a thousand
times haue I heard her say; If I broke my legge, it was all for my
good; for this made mee better knowne then I was before. And
certainely so shee was, and the more noted and respected, nay, and
thriued the better by it, both she and I, and the more plentifull our
haruest and incomes of customers of the best, and wee loued and
liued merrily together to her last. And be but thou vnto me, as she
was; that is to say, a true and faithfull friend; and withall, indeauour
thy selfe to be good, since thou hast so good a patterne to follow.
And for that which thy father left thee, thou hast it safely kept
for thee.</p>

Stay, and attend mee heere at the staires foote, whil'st I goe vp and

good graces and blessings, which heauen hath bestowed vpon you,
to as many as wish you well; For they were not giuen you in vaine,
that you should let them wither, and lose the flowre of your youth

borne: and when man was borne, woman was borne; nothing in

vp; for my sake shew him good countenance; take notice of him;
speake kindly vnto him; entertaine him friendly; and if you thinke
fit, let him inioy you, and you him; and both one another; for

your former speeches vnto me, haue euer beene directed to my
good and benefit: but how is it possible, that I should doe this, that
you would now haue mee? For you know to whom I am bound to
giue an account, as already you haue heard; and if hee know I play
false, he will kill me. My neighbours, they are enuious and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and they will straight-way acquaint him therewith. And say,
that no great ill should befall me, saue only the losing of his loue; it
will be more then I shall gaine, by giuing contentment to him, for
whom you intreate, or rather command mee.</p>

                  <p>What? Is this your fashion? Is this the manner
of your carriage? And you vse these niceties, you shall neuer
haue a house with a double roome, but liue like a begger all the
daies of your life. What? are you afraide of our Sweet-heart now
he is absent? What would you then doe, were he now in Towne?
It hath euer beene my ill fortune, to giue counsell vnto fooles,
such as cannot see their owne good; say what I will, they will
erre; still stand in their owne light. But I doe not much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at it; For though the world be wide, yet there are but few wise
in it. Great is the largenesse of the earth, but small the number of
those that haue experience. Ha, daughter! Did you but see your
cousins wisedome, or but know what benefit my breeding, and
counsell hath brought her, how cunning, how witty, and what a
Mistresse in her arte; you would be of another minde; say, what I
will vnto her, shee patiently indures my reprehensions, shee hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
to my aduice, and does all what I will haue her doe; shee
will sometimes boast, that shee hath at one time had one in bed
with her; another wayting at the doore; and a third sighing for
her within the house; and yet hath giuen good satisfaction to them
all. And art thou afraide, who hast but two to deale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
Can one cock fill all thy Cisternes? One conduit-pipe water all
thy Court? If this be your diet, you may chance to rise a hungred,
you shall haue no meate left against another time; I will not rent
your fragments; I cannot liue vpon scraps; One could neuer please
mee; I could neuer place all my affection vpon one; two can doe
more then one; they giue more, and they haue more to giue. It
goes hard (Daughter) with that Mouse, that hath but one hole to
trust to; for if that be stopt, shee hath no meanes to hide her selfe
from the Cat: he that hath but one eye, you see in what danger he
goes? One sole Act maketh not a Habit. It is a rare, and strange
thing to see a Partridge flye single; to feed alwaies vpon one dish,
brings a loathing to the stomacke; one Swallow makes not a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
one witnesse alone is of no validitie in Law. Hee that hath
but one suite of clothes, and shee that hath but one gowne to her
backe, quickly weares them out. What would you doe (daughter)
with this number of one? Many more inconueniences can I tell thee
of this single soale number (if one may be a number.) If you be wise,
be neuer without two; for it is a laud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and two hands; two sheets vpon one bed; and two smockes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to shift you; and the more you haue, the better it is for you;
for still, (as it is in the Prouerbe) The more Moores, the better
market; and honour without profit, is no other but as a Ring vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the finger. And because one Sacke cannot hold them both,

Whence comes this strangenesse? Whence this coynesse of yours?
This nicenesse? Why (Daughter) doe you thinke that I know not

And that I know not all their tricks and deuices? What they
say, and what they doe? I am sorry to heare that I doe. Besides,
I must tell you, I was once as wanton as you are now, and thought
my penny as good siluer as yours: and many a friend I had that
came vnto mee: yet did I neuer in all my life exclude either old
man, or old woman out of my company, or that euer I refused their
counsell, were it publike or priuate, By my little honesty, I had
rather thou hadst giuen mee a boxe on the eare, then to heare what
I heare. You make of me, as if I had been borne but yesterday. O!
how cunning forsooth, how close you be? for to make your selfe
seeme honest, you would make mee a foole. I must be a kinde of

What man liues there this day, that can say he is more fortunate

then my selfe, that I should enioy so excellent a gift? so curious
a creature? and no sooner aske then haue? Beleeue me, if my heart
could brooke this old womans treasons, I could creepe vpon my
knees to doe her a kindnesse. How shall I bee able to requite her?
O heauens! To whom shall I impart this my ioy? To whom shall
I discouer so great a secret? To whom shall I discouer some part
of my glorie? It is true that the old woman told mee; That of no
prosperitie, the possession can be good without company; and that
pleasure not communicated, is no pleasure. O! who can haue so
true a feeling of this my happinesse, as my selfe? But lo, yonder is
<hi>Sempronio,</hi> standing at our doore; hee hath beene stirring betimes;
I shall haue a pittious life with my Master, if he be gone abroad;

I see it is true; that in this wretched life of ours, there is no
pleasure without sorrow; no contentment without some crosse, or
counterbuffe of fortune. We see our fairest daies, our clearest Sunne-shines
are ouer-cast with clouds, darkenesse and raine: our solaces
and delights are swallowed vp by dolours and by death: laughter,
mirth, and merriment are waited on by teares, lamentations,
and other the like mortall passions. In a word; Sweet meate will
haue sowre sauce: and much ease and much quietnesse, much paine
and much heauinesse. Who could come more friendly, or more
merrily to a man, then I did now to thee? And who could receiue
a more vnkind wellcome, or vnfriendly salutation? Who liues there,
that sees himselfe, as I haue seene my selfe, raised with such glory
to the height of my deare <hi>Areusa's</hi> loue? And who, that sees himselfe
more likely to fall from thence, then I, being so ill intreated, as I
am of thee? Nay, thou wilt not giue mee leaue to tell thee, how
much I am thine, how much I will further thee in all I am able, how
much I repent me of that which is past, and what good counsell and
reprehensions I haue receiued of <hi>Celestina,</hi> and all in fauour of thee,
and thy good, and the good of vs all. And now, that we haue our

                  <p>Because shee told mee how much shee loued you, how

a happy man, Sir, you had no more to doe, but to come and take

will stay a while by it, and take the benefit of the shade. I was long
a comming, but when I came, I went quickly to worke: I dispatcht

Wee haue good white bread, wine of <hi>Monuiedro,</hi> a good gammon

my Masters Tenants brought him in the other day, when they came

iustifie it, and beare me witnesse. We will take order, that all that
hee shall eate thereof, shall doe him no harme; and that our owne

                  <p>Sir, all that is not white, which differs from blacke; nor
is all that gold which glisters. Your accelerated, and hasty desires,
not being measured by reason, make my counsels to seeme better
then they be. Would you, that they should yesterday, at the first
word, haue brought <hi>Melibea</hi> manacled, and tyed to her girdle, as
you would haue sent into the market for any other marchandize?
Wherein there is no more to doe, then to goe into the market, and
take the paines to buy it. Sir, bee of good cheere; giue some ease
and rest to your heart; for no great happinesse can happen in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.
It is not one stroke that can fell an Oake; prepare your selfe
for sufferance, for wisdome is a laudable blessing; and he that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
may withstand a strong incounter.</p>

sit next her whom he loues best: as for me, who am a sole woman, I
will sit me down heere by this Iar of wine, and this good goblet. For
I can liue no longer, then while I talke with one of these two. Euer
since that I was growne in yeeres, I know no better office at boord,
then to fall a skinking, and to furnish the Table with pots and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons:
For he that handles hony, shall feele it still <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Besides, in a cold winters night, you cannot haue a better war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-panne.
For, when I tosse off two of these little pots, when I
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7594:61"/>
am e'en ready to goe into my bed, why, I feele not a iot of cold all
the night long. With this, I furre all my clothes at Christmas: This
warmes my blood; This keepes me still in one estate; This makes
mee merry, where-e're I goe; This makes me looke fresh, and rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as a Rose. Let me still haue store of this in my house, and a figge
for a deare yeere, it shall neuer hurt mee: for one crust of Mouse-eaten
bread will serue me three whole dayes; This driues away all
care and sorrow from the heart, better then either Gold or Corall;
This giues force to a young man, and vigour to an old man; It addes
colour to the discoloured; courage to the coward; diligence to the
slothfull; it comforteth the braine; it expels cold from the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke;
it takes away the stinkingnesse of the breath; it makes cold
constitutions, to be potent and actiue: it makes husbandmen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the toyle of tillage; it makes your painefull and weary mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to sweat out all their watrish ill humours; it remedies Rheumes;
and cures the tooth-ache. This may you keepe long at Sea without
stinking; so can you not water: I could tell you more properties of
this wholsome liquor, than all of you haue hayres on your head. So
that I know not the man, whom it doth not delight to heare it but
mentioned, the very name of it is so pleasing: onely, it has but this
one fault: That that which is good, costs vs deare; and that which is
bad, does vs hurt; So that what maketh the Liuer sound, the same
maketh the purse light; but for all this, I will be sure to seeke after
the best; for that little which I drinke, which is onely some dozen
times a meale. Which number, I neuer passe, vnlesse now, when
I am feasted, or so.</p>

to be true by others, that I haue knowne to be lesse passionate, and
lesse scorched in the fiery flames of loue, then <hi>Calisto</hi> is; in so much,
that I haue seen them neither eat nor drink; neither laught nor weep;
neither sleep nor wake; neither speake nor hold their peace; neither
liue in paine, nor yet finde ease; neither be contented, nor yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of discontentment, answerable to the perplexity of that sweet
and cruell wound of their hearts. And if naturall necessity forceth
them to any one of these, they are so wholly forgetfull of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and strucke into such sudden senslesnesse of their present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and condition, that eating, their hands forget to carry their
meat to their mouthes: Besides, if you talke with them, they neuer
answer you directly. Their bodies are there with you, but where
they loue, there are their hearts, and their senses. Great is the force
of loue. His power doth not only reach ouer the earth, but passeth
also ouer the seas. He holds an equall command ouer all mankinde.
He breaks thorow all kinde of difficulties; and dangers whatsoeuer.
It is a tormentfull thing, full of feare, and of care. His eye roles eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way; nothing can escape him. And if any of you that be heere,

of dores, with their haire about their cares, and their fardles at their
backs, rating them in most vile manner, crying, Out of my doors,
you thiefe, you whore, you strumpet: this is no place for such paltry
baggages. Thou shalt not spoyle my house, I will not be thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured
by thee. So that in stead of expected recompence, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
nothing but bitter reuilements. Where they expect to goe
preferred out of the house, they goe preiudiced out of the house.
And where they expect to be well married, they are quite mar'd in
their reputation. And where they expect iewels and wedding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
there are they sent out naked, and disgraced: these are
their rewards, these their benefits, and these the payments they
receiue for their seruice. They are bound to giue them husbands,
and in liew thereof, they strip them of their clothes. The greatest
grace and honour which they haue in their Ladies house, is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in walking the streetes from one Ladie to another, and to
deliuer their Ladies message<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (As, My Lady hath sent to know how
you doe? how you did rest to night? how your physicke wrought
with you; and how many occasions it gaue your Ladiship, &amp;c?)
They neuer heare their owne name out of their Ladies mouth. But
the best they can call them by, is, Come hither, you whore, Get
you gone, you drabbe, or I'll set you going: Whither gadde you
now, you mangy harlotry; you pockey slut? what haue you done
to day, you loytring Queane? why did you eate this, you rauening
thing, you gor-belly, you greedy cormorant? A you filthy Sow, how
cleane this frying panne is kept? This pispot (Minion) it is well
scowr'd, is it not? why you lazy bones, did you not brush my
clothes, when I left them off, and make cleane my Mantle? Why
said you thus and thus, you Sot, you foolish Asse? Who lost the
piece of plate, you scatter-good, you draggle-tayle? Whats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of my handkercher, you purloyning thiefe? you haue giuen
it to one of your copes-mates, some sweet-heart of yours, that must
helpe to make you a whore: Come hither, you foule flappes, say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Where is my Henne, my cramm'd Henne, that I cannot finde her?
you were best looke her mee out, and that quickly too, vnlesse you
meane I shall make you pay for her, when I come to pay you your
wages. And besides all this, her pantofles shall walke about her
eares a thousand times a day; pinchings, cudgellings, and scourgings
shall be as common to her as her meat and drinke. There is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that knowes how to please and content them; not any that can
indure their tartnesse and curstnesse: their delight is to speake loud;
their glory to chide and to brawle, and the better one does, and the
more one seeks to please them, the lesse are they contented. And
this (mother) is the reason, why I haue rather desires to liue free
from controlement, and to be mistresse in a poore little house of
mine owne, then to liue a slaue, and at command in the richest pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace

                  <p>So great, daughter? hold you this so great a meeting?
It appeares that you haue not knowne me in my prosperity, which
is now some twenty yeeres since. There be those that haue seene
mee in better case then I am now; and hee that now sees mee, I
wonder his heart doth not burst with sorrow. I tell thee,
(wench) I haue seene at this table, where your kinswomen now sit,
nine gallant young wenches, much about your age; for the eldest
was not aboue eighteene, and not one of them vnder foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene.
But such is this world, it comes and goes vpon wheeles.
We are like pots in a water-wheele, or like buckets in a Well; one
vp, and another downe, one full, and another empty; it is fortunes
Law, that nothing can continue any long time in one, and the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
state of being. Her order is alteration; Her custome, change.
I cannot without teares deliuer vnto you the great honour I then
liu'd in; though now, (such is my ill fortune) by little and little, it
hath gone decaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as my daies declined; so diminished and
decreased my profit. It is an old saying; That whatsoeuer is in this
world, it doth either increase or decrease. Euery thing hath it's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits;
Euery thing it's degrees of more or lesse: my honour did
mount to that height, as was fitting for a woman of my quality to
rise vnto; and now of force, it must descend and fall as much: By
this I know, that I am neere to my end, and that the Lease of my
life is now expiring, and all my yeeres are almost spent and gone:
and I also well know, that I did ascend, that I might descend; that
I flourished, for to wither; that I had ioy, that I might haue sorrow;
that I was borne to liue; liu'd, to grow; grew, to grow old; and
grow old to dye: and though it did alwaies appeare vnto me, that I
ought in this respect to suffer my misery the more patiently, yet as I
am formed of flesh and bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beare this heauy masse of sinne
about me, I cannot but thinke on't now and then with griefe, nor
can I wholy as I would, blot euery thought thereof out of the

                  <p>Paines, Sweet-heart? Nay, they were an ease, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
vnto me; they did all of them obey me; they did all of them
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7594:64"/>
honour me; they did all of them reuerence mee: not one of them
that would swarue from my will: what I said, stood for a Law; it
was good and currant amongst them; not any one of them, to whom
I gaue entertainement, euer made their owne choise any further
then it stood with my liking; were he lame, crooked, squint-ey'd,
or crippled: all was one, he was the welcom'st and the soundest, that
brought me the soundest gaines; mine was the profit, and theirs the
paines. Besides, I needed no seruants; for in keeping them, I had
seruants enow. Why, your Noblemen, your Knights, your old
men, your young men, your learned men, men of all sorts and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
from the highest to the lowest; why, they were all at my
seruice: and when I came to a feast, my foote was no sooner in,
but I had presently as many Bonnets vailed vnto me, as if I had been
a Dutchesse: he that had least acquaintance, least businesse with me,
was held the most vile, and basest fellow. They spying me almost a
League off; they would forsake their most earnest occasions, one by
one, two by two, and come to me, to see if I would command them
any seruice; and withall, aske me seuerally, how his loue, how his
mistresse did? When they saw me once passe by, you should haue
such a shuffling and scraping of feet, and all in such a generall gaze,
and so out of order, that they did neither doe nor say any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.
One would call mee mistresse, another Aunt, others their
loue, others honest old woman. There, they would consent, when
they should come to my house: there they would agree when I
should goe vnto theirs; there they would offer mee mony; there
they would make me large promises; there likewise present me with
gifts: some kissing the lappet of my Coat; and some other my
cheeke, that by these kindesses, they might giue mee contentment,
and worke me to their will. But now Fortune hath brought mee to
so low a place in her wheele, that you may say vnto me, Mich you
good dich you with your old ware, you hindges are now growne
rustie for want of oyling.</p>

                  <p>No (my son) <hi>Ioue</hi> forbid that I should raise any such report,
or lay a generall scandall vpon any of their ranke. For, there were
many old good men amongst them, with whom I had but small
dealings, and could scarce endure to see me: But amongst the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
as they grew great in number, so had I a great number of them:
some of one sort, and some of another; some I found very chaste, and
some that took the charge vpon them to maintaine such Traders as
my selfe. And I am still of this beliefe, that of these there is no lack;
and these, forsooth, would send their Squires and young men to
waite vpon me, whithersoeuer I went: and I should scarce haue set
my foote within mine owne doores, but straight at the heeles of me,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7594:64"/>
you should haue one come in with chickens, another with Hens, a
third with Geese, a fourth with Ducks. This man sends me in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triges,
that man Turtle Doues, he a gammon of Bacon, such a one a
Tart, or a Custard; and some good fellow or other a good sucking
Pigge, or two: for euery one, as soone as he had a conuenient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
so they came presently to register them in my house; that I,
and those their pretty soules, might merrily eat them together: and
as for wine, we wanted none; the best that a man could lay his lips
to in the whole City, was sent vnto me from diuers parts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Towne: as that of <hi>Monviedro,</hi> of <hi>Lugne,</hi> of <hi>Toro,</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigall,</hi>
of <hi>San-Martin,</hi> and many other Townes and Villages; And
indeed so many, that albeit I still keepe the differences of their taste
and relish in my mouth, yet doe I not retaine the diuersity of their
foyles in my remembrance. For it is enough for such an old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as I, that when a good cuppe of wine comes neer my nose, I can
be able to say, This is such a wine, or it comes from such a place,
or person; why, your presents from all parts, from all sorts came
vpon me as thicke as hops, as flies to a pot of hony, or as stones that
are throwne vpon a stage: boyes came tumbling in at my doore,
with as much prouision, as they could carry on their backs. But now
those good daies are past, I haue eaten all my white bread in my
youth, and know not how in the world to liue, being fallen from
so happy an estate.</p>

                  <p>Madame, as farre as humane knowledge can discerne of
inward griefe, I dare presume. And for as much, as for the health and
remedy of infirmities, and diseases, these graces were imparted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men, for the finding out of fit and conuenient medicines, whereof
some were attained to by experience, some by Art, and some by a
naturall instinct; some small portion of these good gifts, this poore
old creature my selfe haue gotten, who is heere present to doe you
the best seruice she can.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Melibea.</speaker>
                  <p>O how acceptable and pleasing are thy words to mine
eares! it is a comfortable thing to the sicke patient, to see his physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
to look cheerfully vpon him. Me thinks I see my heart broken
betweene thy hand in pieces, which with a little labour, and by
power and vertue of thy tongue, thou art able (if thou wilt) to ioyne
together, and make it whole againe; euen as easily, as <hi>Alexander</hi>
that great King of <hi>Macedon</hi> dream't of that wholesome roote in
the mouth of a Dragon, wherewith he healed his seruant <hi>Ptolomy,</hi>
who had beene bitten by a Viper; and therefore, for the loue of
<hi>Ioue,</hi> disroabe your selfe, that you may more easily, and more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
looke into the nature of my disease, and affoord me some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Celest.</speaker>
                  <p>A great part of health, is the desiring of health. And a
good signe of mending, to be willing to mend. For which reason I
reckon your griefe the lesse, and hold it the lesse dangerous; But
that I may minister a wholesome medicine vnto you, and such a
one as may be agreeable to your disease; it is requisite, that you
first satisfie me in these three particulars. The first is, on which side
of your body your paine doth lye most? The second, how long
you haue had this paine; whether it hath taken you but of late, or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7594:66"/>
no? For your newly growing infirmities are sooner cured in the
tendernesse of their growth, then when they haue taken deepe
rooting by ouer-long perseuering in their office: So beasts are soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
tamed when they are young, and more easily brought to the
yoake, then when their hide is throughly hardned: So far better doe
those plants grow vp, and prosper, which are remooued when they
are young and tender, then those that are transplanted, hauing long
borne fruit. The third is, whether this your euill hath proceeded
of any cruell thought, which hath taken hold on you? This being
made knowne, you shall see mee set my selfe roundly to worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
your cure; for it is very fit and conuenient, that you should
open the whole truth, as well to your Physician, as your Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour.</p>

                  <p>Friend, <hi>Celestina,</hi> Thou wise Matrone, and great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
in thy Art, thou hast well opened vnto me the way, by which
I may manifest my maladie vnto thee. Beleeue me, you haue questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
me like a wise woman, and like one that is well experienced in
these kind of sickenesses. My paine is about my heart, it's residence,
neere vnto my left Pappe; but disperseth it selfe ouer euery part of
my body. Secondly, it hath beene so but of late; nor did I euer
thinke, that any paine whatsoeuer could haue so depriued me of my
vnderstanding, as this doth; it troubles my sight, changes my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
takes away my stomacke, I cannot sleepe for it, nor will it
suffer mee to inioy any kinde of pleasure: touching the thought,
which was the last thing you demanded, concerning my disease, I
am not able to deliuer it vnto you, and as little the cause thereof;
For neither death of kinsfolke, nor losse of temporall goods, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sudden passion vpon any vision, nor any doting dreame, nor any
other thing can I coniecture to be the cause of it, saue onely a kinde
of alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ration, caused by your selfe vpon your request, which I sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in the behalfe of that Gentleman <hi>Calisto,</hi> when you entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me for my Charme.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Celest.</speaker>
                  <p>What, Madame? Is <hi>Calisto</hi> so bad a man? Is his name so
bad; that onely but to name him, should, vpon the very sound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
send forth such poyson? Deceiue not your selfe; Doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that this is the cause of your griefe: I haue another thing in
the winde, there is more in't then so; but since you make it so dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
if your Ladiship will giue mee leaue, I will tell you the cause
of it.</p>

                  <speaker>Melibea.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, how now, <hi>Celestina,</hi> what a strange request is this
that thou mak'st vnto me? Needest thou to craue leaue of me, who
am to receiue helpe from thee? What Physician did euer demand
such security, for to cure his patient? Speake, speake what you
please; for you shall alwaies haue leaue of mee to say what you
will; alwaies excepted, that you wrong not my honour with your
words.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Celestina.</speaker>
                  <p>I see (Lady) that on the one side you complaine of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7594:67"/>
your griefe, and on the other side, I perceiue, that you feare your
remedy, your feare strikes a feare into mee; which feare causeth si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and silence truce betwixt your malady and my medicine; so
that you selfe will be the cause that your paine shall not cease, nor
my cunning cure you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Melibea.</speaker>
                  <p>By how much the longer you deferre my cure, by so
much the more doe you increase my paine, and augment my passion.
Either thy medicines are of the powder of infamy, and of the iuyce
of corruption, confectionated with some other more cruell paine,
then that which thy patient already feeles; or else thy skill is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth; For if either the one, or the other did not hinder thee,
thou wouldst tell mee of some other remedy boldly, and without
feare, sithence I intreate thee to acquaint me therewith, my honour
full preserued.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Celest.</speaker>
                  <p>Madame, thinke it not strange, that it is harder for him
that is wounded, to indure the torment of hot-scalding Turpentine,
and the sharpe incisions, which gall the heart, and double the paine;
then the wound that is newly inflicted on him that his whole. And
therefore, if you be willing to be cured, and that I should discouer
vnto you the sharp point of my needle, without any feare at all,
frame for your hands and feet a bond of patience and of quietnesse;
for your eyes, a veile of pitty and compassion; for your tongue, a
bridle of silence; for your eares, the bumbast, or stuffing of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and bearing; and then shall you see, what effects this old Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
in her Art, will worke vpon your wounds.</p>

                  <p>O how thou killest me with delayes! For Gods loue,
speake what thou wilt, doe what thou wilt, exercice thy skill, put
thy experience in practice. For, there is not any remedy so sharpe,
as can equall the bitternes of my paine and torment. No, though it
touch vpon mine honour, though it wrong my reputation, though it
afflict my body, though it rip and breake vp my flesh, for to pull
out my grieued heart. I giue thee my faith, to do what thou wilt se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely;
and if I may find ease of my payne, I shall liberally reward
thee.</p>

                  <p>No; it is my honesty that is broken; it is my modesty
that is broken; my too much bashfulnesse and shamefastnesse, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
my swowning, which being my naturall and familiar
friends, and companions, could not sleightly absent themselues from
my face, but they would also carry away my colour with them for
a while, my strength, my speach, and a great part of my vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
But now (my good Mistresse, my faithfull Secretary) since
that which thou so openly knowst, it is in vaine for mee to seeke to
smother it; many, yea many daies, are now ouerpast, since that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Gentleman motioned his loue vnto mee; whose speach and
name was then as hatefull, as now the reuiuing thereof is pleasing
vnto me: with thy Needles thou hast stitcht vp my wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; I am come
to thy Bent; it is in thy power to do with me what thou wilt. In my
girdle, thou carriedst away with thee the possession of my liberty:
His anguish was my greater torment; his paine my greater punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I highly praise and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend your singular sufferance, your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
boldnes, your liberall paines, your sollicitous &amp; faithfull steps,
your pleasing speach, your good wisedome, your excessiue solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and your profitable importunity: the Gentleman is much
bound vnto you, and my selfe more; for my reproaches and
reuilings could neuer make thee to slacke thy courage, thy strong
continuance, and forcible perseuerance in thy suite, relying still on
thy great subtilty and strength of wit; or rather bearing thy selfe
like a most faithfull and trusty seruant, being then most diligent,
when thou wast most reuiled; the more I did disgrace thee, the more
wast thou importunate; the harsher answer I gaue thee, the better
didst thou seeme to take it: when I was most angry, then wast thou
most milde and humble: and now, by laying aside all feare, thou
hast gotten that out of my bosome, which I neuer thought to haue
discouered vnto thee, or to any other whosoeuer.</p>

                  <p>My most deare both Lady &amp; friend, wonder not so much
at this; for those ends, that haue their effect, giue me daringnesse to
indure those craggy and dangerous by-waies, by which I come to
such Recluses as your selfe. True it is, that vntill I had resolued
with my selfe, as well on my way hitherwards, as also heere in your
house, I stood in great doubt, whether were I best discouer my peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vnto you or no? When I did thinke on the great power of your
father, then did I feare; but when withall, I weygh'd the noblenesse
of <hi>Calisto,</hi> then I grew bold againe; when I obserued your discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I waxed timorous; but when I considered your vertue, and
your courtesie, I recouered new courage: in the one, I found feare;
in the other, safety. And since, Madame, you haue beene willing to
grace me with the discouery of so great a fauour, as now you haue
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7594:69"/>
made knowne vnto mee, declare your will vnto mee, lay your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
in my lappe; put into my hands the managing of this matter,
and I will giue it such a forme, as both you and <hi>Calisto</hi> shall very

                  <p>Friend <hi>Lucrecia,</hi> my loyall seruant, &amp; faithfull secretary,
you haue heere seene, that I haue no power ouer my selfe; and
what I haue done, lies not in my hands to helpe it. Loue hath made
me prisoner to that Gentleman. I intreat thee (for pittie sake) that
you will signe what you haue seene, with the seale of secresy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I may come to the enioying of so sweet a Loue: In requitall
whereof, thou shalt be held by me, in that high regard, as thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
seruice deserueth.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lucrecia.</speaker>
                  <p>Madame, long afore this, I perceiued your wound, and
sounded your desire: I did much pitty your torment; for, the more
you sought to hide from me the fire which did burne you, the more
did those flames manifest themselues in the colour of your face, in
the little quietnesse of your heart, in the restlesnes of your members,
in your tossing to and fro, in eating without any appetite, and in
your vnablenesse to sleepe: So that I did continually see from time
to time, as plainely as if I had beene within you, most manifest, and
apparant signes of your wretched estate; but because in that instant,
when as will reigneth in those whom we serue, or a disordinate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
it is fitting for vs that are seruants, to obey them with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
diligence, and not to checke and controle them with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall
counsels of the tongue. And therefore did I suffer with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7594:69"/>
paine, held my peace with feare, concealed with fidelity; though I
alwaies held it better to vse sharpe Counsell then smooth flattery.
But since that your Ladiship hath no other remedy for your reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie,
but either to die or to liue; it is very meete, that you should
make choice of that for the best, which in it selfe is best.</p>

it, I will not therefore compare therewith my small desert,

it with your magnificence, before which it is nothing. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall

thy heart, which was vpon fainting; and thy wits, which
were vpon turning. <hi>Melibea</hi> is pained more for you, then you for
her: <hi>Melibea</hi> loues you, and desires to see you: <hi>Melibea</hi> spends

the other still taketh comfort. It is strange, Sir, that you will not
consider who you are, nor the time that you haue spent in her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice;
nor the person, whome you haue made to be your meanes:
And likewise, that hitherto, thou hast euer beene in doubt of hauing
her, and yet didst still endure all with patience; and now, that
I doe certifie vnto thee the end of thy torment, wilt thou put an
end to thy life? Consider, consider, I pray, with thy selfe, that
<hi>Celestina</hi> is on thy side; and that although all should be wanting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, which in a Louer were to be required, I would sell thee for
the most complete gallant of the world; for I would make for thee
mountaines of most craggy rocks, to grow plaine, and smooth. Nay,
more, I would make thee goe to thorow the deepest channell, or the
lightest swelling sea, without wetting of thy foot: you know not on
whom you haue bestowed your Largesse.</p>

tinckling of a bell, driues the Partridges into the net: the songs of

concession of her loue, will seaze hand-smooth on a whole

and our deaths: Being like heerein to the teatling Lambe,

so that with the great number of people which they haue in the
house, they may catch both the old ones and the young one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the nest, whilest shee shrugging and rubbing her selfe by

being well armed, goe towards the house of <hi>Melibea. Lucrecia</hi>

being betwixt them; <hi>Parmeno</hi> and <hi>Sempronio</hi> withdraw
themselues a little waies off. They heare some people comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

demand their share of her paines; <hi>Celestina</hi> dissembles the matter,

                  <p>O how it discontents me, to see seruants
so wretchlesse! Of my much mindfulnesse for this
nights meeting, and your much vnmindfulnesse,
and extreme carelesnesse, there might haue been
had some indifferent both remembrance, and
care; how inconsiderately (knowing how much it importeth mee,
to be either tenne or eleuen) dost thou answer mee at hap-hazard,
with that which comes first to mouth? O vnhappy I, if by chance
I had ouerslept my selfe! and my demand had depended on the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of <hi>Sempronio,</hi> to make of eleuen, ten, and of twelue, but eleuen?
<hi>Melibea</hi> might haue come forth; I had not gone out; and shee
returned backe: so that, neither my misery should haue had an end,
nor my desire haue taken effect. And therefore it is not said in

                  <p>What dost thou thinke (<hi>Sempronio</hi>) of the foole our
Master, who thought to haue made me to be his Target, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the incounter of this first danger? What doe I know, who
stands betweene or behind the dores? What know I if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
treason intended, or no? What can I tell, whether <hi>Melibea</hi> haue
plotted this, to cry quittance with our Master, for this his great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption?
Besides, wee are not sure, whether the old Trot told
him truth or no. Thou knowst not, <hi>Parmeno,</hi> how to speake. Thy
life shall be taken from thee, and thou ne'r the wiser for it: thy
soule shall be let forth, &amp; thou not know who was he that did it. Do
not thou turne flatterer, nor sooth vp thy Master in euery thing,
that he would haue thee, and then thou shalt neuer haue cause to
weepe for other mens woes, or to mourne for others miseries. Doe
thou not follow <hi>Celestina's</hi> counsell in that which is fit and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for thee, and thou wert as good goe breake thy neck blind-fold.
Goe on with thy good perswasions, and faithfull admonitions, and
thou shalt bee well cudgell'd for thy labour. Turne the leafe
now no more, lest thou be forced to bid the world good night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

for I cannot containe my selfe for very ioy, to thinke, that I should
make him beleeue, that it was most fit for him to goe to the doore;
when as indeed, I did onely put him on, because I held it fittest for
mine owne safety. Who could euer haue brought a businesse more
handsomely about for his owne good, then I my selfe haue done?
Thou shalt see mee doe many such things, if thou shalt heerafter

<hi>Calisto</hi> himselfe, as all those who shall any way inter-meddle,
or interpose themselues in this businesse. For, I am assured that this

that eateth, is sure to pay soundly for it.</p>

But prepare thy selfe, and like a tall souldier, be in readinesse vpon
the first Alarme, or word giuen, to betake thee to thy heeles. Do like
the men of <hi>Villa-Diego,</hi> who being besieged, ranne away by night,

that I may runne away the nimbler, and out-strip my fellowes.
And I am glad (good brother) that thou hast aduised mee to that,
which otherwise, euen for very shame, and feare of thee, I should
neuer haue done: as for our Master, if he chance to be heard, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
discouered, he will neuer escape, I feare mee, the hands of

commanded this her captiue to come to this very place, where

that shewes himselfe an open enemy? or who is he that shewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

hast wrought for mee so great and strange wonders? O,
how long agoe did I entertaine this thought in my heart, and as a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7594:75"/>
thing impossible, repeld it from my memory, vntill now, that the
bright beames of thy most cleare shining countenance, gaue light
vnto my eyes, inflamed my heart, awakened my tongue, inlarged
my desert, abridged my cowardize, vnwreathed my shrunke-vp spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
reinforced my strength, put life and metall into my hands and
feet; and in a word, infused such a spirit of boldnesse into me, that
they haue borne me vp by their power, vnto this high estate, wherin
(with happinesse) I now behold my selfe, in hearing this thy sweet-pleasing
voyce; which if I had not heertofore knowne, and sented out
the sweet and wholsome sauour of thy words, I should hardly haue
beleeued they would haue been without deceit. But now, that I am
well assured of thy pure and noble, both bloud and actions, I stand
amazed at the gaze of my good, and with a stricter eye, beginne to
view and looke vpon my selfe, to see whether I am that same <hi>Calisto,</hi>
whom so great a blessing hath befalne?</p>

thy noblenesse of birth, haue (euer since I had true notice of thee)
wrought so effectually with mee, that my heart hath not so much as
one moment bin absent from thee. And although (now these many
dayes) I haue stroue, and stroue againe to dissemble it, yet could
I not so smother my thoughts, but that as soone as that Woman
returned thy sweet name vnto my remembrance, I discouered my
desire, and appointed our meeting, at this very place and time:
Where, I beseech thee to take order for the disposing of my person,
according to thine owne good will and pleasure. These doores de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre
vs of our ioy, whose strong locks and barres I curse, as also
mine owne weake strength. For were I stronger, and they weaker,
neither shouldst thou be displeased, nor I discontented.</p>

a paltry piece of wood to hinder our ioy? Neuer did I conceiue,
that any thing, saue thine owne will, could possibly hinder vs. O
troublesome and sport-hindring doores, I earnestly desire, that you
may be burned with as great a fire, as the torment is great, which
you giue me; for then the third part thereof would be sufficient to
consume you to ashes in a moment. Giue me leaue (sweet Lady) that
I may call my seruants, and command them to breake them open.</p>

He is comming to seeke after vs; wee shall make a badde yeere of

your own and mine. Content your selfe therefore, and come you to
morrow at this very houre, and let your way be by the wall of my
garden; for if you should now breake downe these cruell doores,
though haply wee should not be presently heard, yet to morrow
morning there would arise in my fathers house a terrible suspition
of my errour: and you know, besides, that by so much the greater

in the turning of a hand, will be noysed thorow the whole City.</p>

all her cunning trickes and deuices; and did thereupon aduise you,

watching still as diligently as a Cat for a Mouse; that if I had heard

performe. And <hi>Parmeno,</hi> though till now, he did not seeme to serue
you in this businesse with any great willingnesse, hee was as glad,
when hespy'd the Torches comming, as the Wolfe, when hee spies

for it is naturall in him to be valiant; and though he would not haue

My sonnes; I am much bound vnto you both, pray to heauen for our

looke otherwise now, and not carry that sowre countenance heer, as
thou didst there, when we incountred so many; for mine owne part,
before those, that I knew could doe but little, I neuer made show
that I could doe much. Mother, I haue brought hither my armes
all broken and battred in pieces, my Buckler without it's ring of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
the plates being cut asunder, my Sword like a Saw, all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hack't
and hewd, my Caske strangely bruised, beaten as flat as a
Cake, and dented in with the blowes that came hammering on my
head: so that I haue not any thing in the world to goe further with
my Master, when hee shall haue occasion to vse mee. For it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on, that my Master shall this night haue accesse vnto his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,

you know it is with him, but aske and haue; he will present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnish you, I warrant you. For hee is none of those who say to
their seruants: Liue with mee, and looke out some other to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
thee; he is so franke, and of so liberall a disposition, that hee
will not giue thee money for this only, but much more, if neede be.</p>

that he hath in armes. How can you in conscience thinke, or with
what face imagine, that I should be so importunate, as to demand
more of him, then what he hath already done of his owne accord?
He for his part hath done inough, I would not it should be said of
me, that hee hath giuen mee an inch, and that I should take an ell.
There is a reason in all things; he hath giuen vs a hundred crownes
in gold; he hath giuen vs, besides, a chaine; three such picks more,
will picke out all the waxe in his eare; hee hath, and will haue a
hard market of it. Let vs content our selues with that which is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
Let vs not lose all, by seeking to gaine more then is meet; for

                  <p>How wittily this Asse thinks he hath spoken! I sweare to
thee, by the reuerence of this my old age, had these words beene
spoken after dinner, I should haue said, that wee had all of vs taken
a cuppe too much; that we had beene all drunke. Art thou well in
thy wits, <hi>Sempronio?</hi> What has thy remuneration to doe with my
reward? Thy payment with my merit? Am I bound to buy you
weapons? Must I repaire your losses, and supply your wants? Now
I thinke vpon it; let me be hang'd, or dye any other death, if thou
hast not tooke hold of a little word, that carelesly slipt out of my
mouth the other day, as we came along the street; for as (I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
I then told you, that what I had was yours; and that I would
neuer be wanting vnto you in any thing, to the vtmost of my poore
ability; and that if Fortune did prosper my businesse with your
Master, that you should lose nothing by it; But you know (<hi>Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi>)
that words of compliment and kindnesse, are not obligatory,
nor binde me to doe, as you would haue mee; all is not gold that
glisters, for then it would be a great deale cheaper then it is. Tell me
(<hi>Sempronio</hi>) if I haue not hit the right nayle on the head? Thou
maist see by this, that though I am old, that I can diuine as much
as thou canst imagine. In good faith (Sonne) I am as full of griefe,
as euer my heart can hold, I am euen ready to burst with sorrow and
anguish. As soone as euer I came from your house, and was come
home; I gaue the chaine I brought hither with me, to this foole
<hi>Elicia,</hi> that she might looke vpon it, and cheere her selfe with the
sight thereof; and she, for her life, cannot as yet call to mind what
shee hath done with it: and all this liue-long night, neither shee
nor I haue slept one winke, for very thought and griefe thereof:
Not so much for the valew of the chaine (for it was not much
worth) but to see, that she should be so carelesse in the laying of it
vp; and to see the ill lucke of it; at the very same time that we mist
it, came in some friends of mine, that had beene of my old and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
acquaintance; and I am sorely afraide, lest they haue lighted
vpon it, and taken it away with them; meaning to make vse of that
vulgar saying, <hi>Si spie it, tum sporte fac; Si non spie it, packe and away
Iacke.</hi> But now (my Sonnes) that I may come a little neerer vnto
you both, and speake home to the point: If your Master gaue mee
any thing, what he gaue me, that (you must thinke) is mine: As for
your cloth of gold doublet, I neuer ask't you any share out of it, nor
euer will. We all of vs serue him, that he may giue vnto vs all, as
he sees wee shall deserue: And as for that which he hath giuen me,
I haue twice indangered my life for it; more blades haue I blunted
in his seruice then you both; more materiall and substantiall stuffe
haue I wasted, and haue worne out more hose and shooes; And you
must not thinke (my Sonnes) but all this costs mee good money.
Besides, my skill, which I got not playing or sitting still, or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
my taile ouer the fire, as most of your idle huswiues doe, but
with hard labour and paines-taking: as <hi>Parmeno's</hi> mother could
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7594:79"/>
well witnesse for me, if she were liuing. This I haue gained by mine
owne industry and labour; as for you, what haue you done? If you
haue done any thing for <hi>Calisto, Calisto</hi> is to requite you. I get my
liuing by my Trade and my trauell; you, yours, with recreation and
delight; and therefore you are not to expect equall recompence,
inioying your seruice with pleasure, as I, who goe performing it
with paines: but whatsoeuer I haue hitherto said vnto you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you shall see, I will deale kindely with you: if my chaine be
found againe, I will giue each of you a paire of Scarlet Breeches,
which is the comeliest habit that young men can weare. But if it
be not found, you must accept of my good will, and my selfe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to sit downe with my losse; and all this I doe out of pure loue,
because you were willing that I should haue the benefit of mana<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ging
this businesse before another: and if this will not content you,
I cannot doe withall. To your owne harme be it.</p>

cannot flye from you? On an old woman of sixty yeeres of age?
Get you, get you, for shame, amongst men, such as your selues; goe

hath proceeded from my ioy. Either the trauaile of
my body caused so sound a sleepe; or else the glory
and pleasure of my minde: Nor doe I much wonder, that both the
one and the other should linke hands, and ioyne together to cloze
the lids of mine eyes, since I trauail'd the last night with my body
and person, and tooke pleasure with my spirit and senses. True it is,
that sorrow causeth much thought; and ouermuch thought, much

hindreth sleepe: as it was mine owne case within these few daies,

                  <p>O Sir, had you seen them, your heart would haue burst with
griefe: One of them had all his braines beaten out in most pittifull
manner, and lay without any sense, or motion in the world: The
other had both his armes broken, &amp; his face so sorely bruised, that
it was all blacke, and blue, and all of a goare-bloud. For, that they
might not fall into the <hi>Alguazils</hi> hands, they leapt downe out of a
high window; and so being in a manner quite dead, they chopt
off their heads, when, I thinke, they scarce felt, what harme was
done them.</p>

and had lost my life, so I had not lost my honour, &amp; my hope of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuing
my commenced purpose, which is, the greatest griefe and
distaste that in this case I feele. O my name and reputation, how
vnfortunately dost thou goefrom Table to Table, from mouth to
mouth! O yee my secret, my secret actions, how openly will you
now walke thorow euery publike street, and open Market-place?
What shall become of me? Whither shall I go? If I goe forth to the
dead, I am vnable to recouer them, and if I stay heere, it will be
deemed cowardize. What counsell shall I take? Tell me, <hi>Sosia,</hi>

                  <p>O wretched and vnfortunate day! O sorrow, able to breake

they knew of my doings; &amp; whatsoeuer was done in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
I dare not go forth of doores; I am ashamed to looke any man
in the face. O miserable young men! that yee should suffer death by
so sudden a disaster. O my ioyes, how doe you goe declining, and
waining from me! But it is an ancient Prouerbe; That the higher a
man climbes, the greater is his fall. Last night I gained much; to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day
I haue lost much. Your Sea-calmes are rare, &amp; seldome. I might
haue beene listed in the roll of the happy, if my fortune would but
haue allayd these tempestuous winds of my perdition. O Fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
how much, and thorow how many parts hast thou beaten mee!
But howsoeuer thou dost shake my house, and how opposite soeuer
thou art vnto my person, yet are aduersities to be endured with an
equall courage: and by them, the heart is prooued, whether it be
of Oke, or Elder, strong, or weake; there is no, better Say, or
Touchstone in the world, to know what finenesse, or what Characts
of Vertue or of Fortitude remain in man. And therefore come what
will come, fall backe, fall edge, I will not desist to accomplish her
desire, for whose sake all this hath hapned. For it is better for mee
to pursue the benefit of that glory, which I expect, then the losse of
those that are dead. They were proud, and stout, and would haue
beene slaine at some other time, if not now. The old woman was
wicked and false, as it seemes, in her dealings, not complying with
that contract which shee had made with them: so that they fell out
about the true mans cloake; taking it from the true owner, to share
it amongst themselues. But this was a iust iudgement of God vpon
her, that she should receiue this payment, for the many adulteries,
which by her intercession and meanes haue beene committed.
<hi>Sosia</hi> and <hi>Tristianico</hi> shall prouide themselues; they shall accompany
me, in this my desired walke; they shall carry the Scaling-ladders,
for the walls are very high. To morrow I will abroad, and see if I
can reuenge their deaths; if not, I will purge my innocency with
a fained absence; or else faine my selfe mad, that I may the better
inioy this so tastefull a delight of my sweet Loue; as did that great

I know not whether the cause of it be, that there commeth now to

that Lady, whom I so dearelie loue, before it was further day? Or
whether it be the griefe, which I conceiue of my dishonour, by

lights vpon mee by the death of my seruants? what haue I done?
How can I possibly containe my selfe? How can I forbeare any

                     </gap> which hath been offered mee? O the miserable sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of this most short and transitorie life! who is he so couetous
of thy countenance, who will not rather choose to die presently,
then to inioy a whole yeere of a shamfull life? and to prorogue it
with dishonour, loosing the good report and honourable memory
of his noble Ancestours? Especially, sithence that in this world,
wee haue not any certaine or limited time: no not so much as a
moment or a minute. We are debtours without time: wee stand
continually bound to present payment. Why haue I not gone
abroad, and made all the inquiry I can, after the secret cause of my
open perdition? O thou short delight of the world, how little do
thy pleasure last? and how much doe they cost? Repentance
should not be bought so deare. O miserable that I am, when shall
I recouer so great a losse? what shall I doe? what counsell shall I
take? To whom shall I discouer my disgrace? why do I conceale
it from the rest of my seruants and kinsefolke? They clip and note
my good name in their Councell-house and publike Assemblie,
and make mee infamous throughout the whole Kingdome: and
they of mine owne house and kindred must not know of it; I will
out amongst them. But if I goe out and tell them that I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
it is too late; if absent, it is too soone. And to prouide mee
of friends, antient seruants, and neere àllyes, it will aske some
time, as likewise that we be furnish'd with Armes, and other prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7594:86"/>
of vengeance. O thou cruell Iudge, what ill payment hast
thou made mee of that my fathers bread, which so often thou hast
eaten? I thought, that by thy fauour I might haue kill'd
a thousand men without controlment. O thou falsifier of faith,
thou persecutor of the truth, thou man moulded of the baser sort
of earth! Truly is the prouerbe verified in thee; that for want of
good men thou wast made a Iudge. Thou shouldst haue considered,
that thy selfe, and those thou didst put to death, were seruants to
my Ancestors and me, and thy fellowes and companions. But when
the base to riches doth ascend, he regardeth neither kindred nor
friend. Who would haue thought, that thou wouldst haue wrought
my vndoing? But there is nothing more hurtfull, then an vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
enemy. Why wouldst thou that it should be verified of
thee, That that which came out of <hi>Aetna,</hi> should consume <hi>Aetna?</hi>
And that I hatcht the Crow, which pick't out mine eyes? Thou

                     </gap>fe art a publike delinquent, and yet punishest those that were
priuate offendors. But I would haue thee to know; that a priuate
fault is lesse then a publike, and lesse the inconuenience and danger:
At least, according to the Lawes of <hi>Athens,</hi> which were not written
in blood, but doe shew that it is a lesse error, not to condemne a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent,
then to punish the innocent. O how hard a matter is it,
to follow a iust cause before an vniust Iudge! How much more
this excesse of my seruants, which was not free from offence! But
consider with all spite of all Stoicall Paradoxe, their guilt was not
equall, though their sufferings alike. What deseru'd the one, for
that which the other did? That onely because he was his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
thou shouldst doome them both to death? But why doe
I talke thus? With whom doe I discourse? Am I in my right wits?
What's the matter with thee, <hi>Calisto?</hi> Dream'st thou, sleep'st thou,
or wak'st thou? Stand'st thou on thy feete? Or liest thou all along?
Consider with thy selfe that thou art in thy chamber. Doest thou
not see that the offendor is not present? With whome doest thou
contend? Come againe to thy self; weigh with thy selfe, that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
were neuer fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nd iust. But if thou wilt be vpright in thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thou must keepe an eare for either party. Doest thou not
see, that the Law is supposed to be equall vnto all? Remember
that <hi>Romulus,</hi> the first founder of <hi>Rome,</hi> kill'd his owne brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he transgressed the Law. Consider that <hi>Torquatus</hi> the <hi>Romane</hi>
slew his owne sonne, because he exceeded his Commission. And
many other like vnto these did this man doe. Thinke likewise with
thy selfe, that if the Iudge were here present, hee would make
thee this Answer; that the Principall and the Accessary, the Actor
and Consenter, doe merit equall punishment. Howbeit, they
were both notwithstanding executed, for that which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted
but by one. And if that other had not his pardon, but receiued
a speedy iudgement, it was, because the fault was notorious, and
needed no further proofes: as also that they were taken in the very
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7594:86"/>
Act of murther, and that one of them was found dead of his fall
from the window. And it is likewise to be imagined, That that
weeping wench which <hi>Celestina</hi> kept in her house, made them to
hasten the more by her wofull and lamentable noyse: And that
the Iudge, that he might not make a hurly burly of it, that he
might not defame mee, and that he might not stay till the people
should presse together, and heare the proclaiming of that great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
which could not choose but follow mee, hee did sentence
them so early as he did; and the common Hangman, which was
the Cryer, could doe no otherwise, that he might cumply with
their execution and his owne discharge. All which, if it were
done as I conceiue it to bee, I ought rather to rest his debtor,
and thinke my selfe bound vnto him the longest day of my life, not
as to my fathers sometimes seruant, but as to my true and naturall
brother. But put case it were not so; or suppose I should not co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it in the better sence, yet call, <hi>Calisto,</hi> to mind the great ioy and solace
thou hast had, bethinke thy selfe of thy sweete Lady and Mistrisse,
and thy whole and sole happines: and since for her sake thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemest
thy life as nothing for to doe her seruice, thou art not to
make any reckoning of the death of others: and the rather, because
no sorrow can equall thy receiued pleasure. O my Lady and my
life, that I should euer thinke to offend thee in thy absence! And
yet in doing as I doe, me thinks, it argues against mee, that I hold
in small esteeme that great and singular fauour, which I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
at thy hands. I will now no longer thinke on griefe; I will
no longer entertaine friendship with sorrow. O incomparable
good! O insatiable contentment! And what could I haue asked
more of heauen, in requitall of all my merits in this life (if they be
any) then that which I haue already receiued? Why should I not
concent my selfe with so great a blessing? which being so, it stands
not with reason that I should be vngratefull vnto him, who hath
conferr'd vpon mee so great a good: I will therefore acknowledge
it, I will not with care craze my vnderstanding, lest that being lost,
I should fall from so high and so glorious a possession. I desire no
other honour, no other glory, no other riches, no other father nor
mother, no other friends nor kinsfolkes. In the day, I will abide
in my chamber: In the night, in that sweete Paradise, in that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
groue, that greene plot of ground amidst those sweete trees
and fresh and delightsome walks. O night of sweet rest and quiet!
O that thou hadst made thy returne! O bright shining <hi>Phoebus,</hi> driue
on thy Charriot apace, make haste to thy iourneys end. O comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and delightfull starres, breake your wont, and appeare before
your time, &amp; out of your wonted and continued course! O dull and
slow clocke, I wish to see thee burned in the quickest and loueliest
fire that Loue can make. For didst thou but expect that which I
doe, when thou strikest twelue, thou wouldst neuer indure to bee
tyed to the will of the master that made thee! O yee hyematicall
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7594:87"/>
and winterly months, which now hide your heads, and liue in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and obscurity! Why haste yee not to cut off these tedious daies
with your longer nights? Me thinks, it is almost a yeere, since I
saw that sweete comfort and most delightfull refreshing of my
trauels. But what doe I aske? Why like a foole doe I, out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie
desire that which neuer either was or shall bee? For your
naturall courses did neuer learne to wheele away. For to all of
them there is an equall course, to all of them one and the selfe-same
space and time. Not so much as to life and death, but there
is a settled and limited end. The secret motions of the high firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of heauen, of the Planets and the North-starre, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and wane of the Moone, all of these are ruled with an equall
reyne, all of these are moued with an equall spurre. Heauen, Earth,
Sea, Fire, Wind, Heate and Cold. What will it benefit me, that
this clocke of yron should strike twelue, if that of heauen doe not
hammer with it? And therefore though I rise neuer so soone, it
will neuer the sooner be day. But thou my sweete Imagination,
thou, who canst onely helpe me in this case, bring thou vnto my
Phantasie the vnparaleld presence of that glorious Image. Cause
thou to come vnto my eares that sweete Musicke of her words,
those her vnwilling hangings off without profit, that her prety,
I prythee leaue off; Forbeare, good Sir, if you loue me; Touch me
not; Doe not deale so discourteously with me. Out of whose ruddy
lips, me thinks, I heare these words still sound, Doe not seek my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing:
which she would euermore be out withall. Besides, those her
amorous imbracements betwixt euery word; that her loosing of her
selfe from me; and clypping mee againe; that her flying from mee
and her comming to mee; those her sweete sugred Kisses; and that
her last salutation wherewith shee tooke her leaue of mee. O with
what paine did it issue from her mouth! with what resuscitation of
her spirits! with how many teares, which did seeme to be so many
round pearles, which did fall without any noyse from her cleare
and resplendent eyes!</p>

heard tell of the loue betwixt <hi>Calisto</hi> and that foole <hi>Melibea.</hi> And
you likewise saw how <hi>Celestina,</hi> at the intercession of <hi>Sempronio,</hi> so
as shee might be paid for her paines, vndertooke the charge of

shee vsed such diligence, and was so carefull in the following of it,
that shee drew water at the second spitting. Now when <hi>Calisto</hi>
saw so good and so quicke a dispatch, which he neuer hoped to

when she saw her selfe so rich, appropriated the whole gaine to her

it being before agreed vpon betweene them, that whatsoeuer <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listo</hi>
gaue her, they should share it alike. Now, they being come
home weary one morning from accompaning their Master, with
whom they had beene abroad all night, being in great choller and
heate, vpon I know not what quarrells and brawles, (as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
said) that had betyded them, they demanded part of the
chayne of <hi>Celestina,</hi> for to relieue themselues therewith. Shee stood
vpon deniall of any such couenant or promise made betweene
them; affirming the whole gaine to be due to her; and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
withall other petty matters of some secrecie. For, (as it in
the Prouerbe) when Gossips brawle, then out goes all. So that
they being mightily inraged, on the one side necessity did vrge
them, which rents and breaks all the loue in the world; on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

them, which many times workes an alteration in vs. And besides,
they saw that they were forsaken in their fayrest hopes, shee break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her faith and promise with them: So that they knew not in
the world what to do; and so continued a great while vpon termes
with her, some hard words passing to and fro betweene them. But
in the end perceiuing her couetous disposition, and finding that she
still perseuered in her denyall, they layd hands vpon their swords,
and hackt and hew'd her in a thousand pieces.</p>

with what patience I beare it, and passe it ouer.</p>

                  <p>O! I grow mad. O wretch that I am, I am ready to run

O how much better, and more honest had my teares beene in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

haue lost both money, meate, drinke, and clothes; I haue lost my
friend, and such a one, that had hee beene my husband, hee could
not haue beene more kinde vnto mee. O thou wise <hi>Celestina,</hi> thou
much honoured Matrone, and of great authority; how often did'st
thou couer my faults by thy singular wisdome? Thou took'st paines,
whil'st I tooke pleasure; thou went'st abroad, whil'st I staid at home;
thou went'st in tatters and ragges, whil'st I did ruffle in Silkes and
Satens; thou still camest home like a Bee, continually laden, whil'st
I did nothing but spend, and play the vnthrift: for I knew
not else what to doe. O thou worldly happinesse, and ioy, which

occasioners of so many deaths! let some ill attend vpon your loue;
let your sweete meate haue some sowre sauce; your pleasure, paine;
let your ioy be turned into mourning; the pleasant flowres whereon
you tooke your stolne solace, let them be turned into Serpents and
Snakes; your songs, let them be turned into howlings; the shady

yours, though it be neuer so much broken, it will be soldred, and
made whole againe: And many things may be reuenged, which are

                  <p>But by whom shall we mend our selues? Of whom shall
we be reuenged, when as her death, and those that slew her, haue
brought all this affliction and anguish vpon mee? Nor doth the
punishment of the delinquent lesse grieue me, then the errour they
committed. What would you haue me to do, when as all the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
lies vpon my shoulders? I would with all my heart that I were
now with them, that I might not lie heere, to lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
them all as I doe. And that which grieues mee most, is, to
see that for all this, that Villaine <hi>Calisto,</hi> who hath no sense, nor fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his seruants deaths, goes euery night to see and visit his
filth <hi>Melibea,</hi> feasting and solacing himselfe in her company, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
she growes proud, glorying to see so much bloud to be sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

                  <p>If this be true, of whom can wee reuenge our selues bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
And therefore, hee that hath eaten the meate, let him pay the
shot; leaue the matter to mee, let me alone to deale with them: For,
if I can but tracke them, or but once find the sent of their footing,
or but haue the least inkling in the world, when, how, where, and
at what houre they visit one another, neuer hold me true daughter
to that old pasty-wench whom you knew full well, if I doe not giue
them sowre sauce to their sweete meate; and make that their loue
distastefull, which now they swallow downe with delight; and if I
imploy in this businesse that Ruffian, whom you found mee rayling
against, when you came into the house, if he proue not a worse Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner
for <hi>Calisto,</hi> then <hi>Sempronio</hi> was for <hi>Celestina,</hi> neuer trust me
more. O! how quickely the Villaine would fat himselfe with ioy,
and how happy would hee hold himselfe, if I would but impose any
seruice vpon him! for he went away from me very sad and heauy,
to see how coursely I vsed him: and should I but now send for him
againe, and speake kindly vnto him, he would thinke himselfe taken
vp in some strange sweet rapture; so much will he be rauished with
ioy. And therefore tell me (Cousin) how I may learne, how this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
goes, for I will set such a trap for them, as, if they be taken in
it, shall make <hi>Melibea</hi> weepe as much, as now she laugheth.</p>

to send <hi>Sosia</hi> hither vnto me, I will take him in hand a little, I will
entertaine talke with him; and one while I will so flatter him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
while make him such faire offers, that in the end, I will diue
into him, and reach the very depth of his heart, and learne from
him, as well what hath beene already, as what is to be done heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7594:90"/>
At least learne so much as we desire to know, or may serue our
turne; and when I shall haue effected this, I will make him and his
Master to vomit vp all the pleasure they haue eaten. And thou (<hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>)
that art as deare to me, as mine owne soule, doe not you vexe
your selfe any more, but bring your apparell, and such implements
as you haue, and come and liue with mee; for there where you are,
you shall remaine all alone: and sadnesse (you know) is a friend to
solitarinesse. What wench? anew Loue will make thee forget the
old: one Sonne that is borne, will repaire the loue of three that
be dead. With a new successour, we receiue a new the ioyfull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and lost delights of forepassed times. If I haue a loafe of bread,
or a penny in my purse, thou shalt haue halfe of it. And I haue more
compassion of thy sorrow, then of those that did cause it. True it is,
that the losse of that doth grieue a man more, which hee already
possesseth, then the hope of the like good can glad him, be it neuer so
certaine. You see, the matter is past all remedy; and dead men cannot
be recald: you know the old saying: Fie vpon this weeping, let them
dye, and we liue. As for the rest that remaine behinde, leaue that

to dwell with you; as the offer is very kinde, so I yeeld you the best
kinde of thankes I can render you; and <hi>Ioue</hi> blesse you for it, and

kindred and Alliance serue not for shadowes, but ought rather to be

be willing to doe, as you would haue mee, in regard of that desire,
which I haue to inioy your sweet company; yet can it not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
be done, in regard of that losse which would light vpon me; for
I know, it cannot but be greatly to my hindrance; the reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I need not to tell you, because I speake to one that is intelligent,
and vnderstands my meaning; for there, Cousin, where I am, I am
well knowne; there am I well customed; that house will neuer

The which with much diligence and carefulnesse, wee ought from

in the world, what should be the reason, why they should be so
hot vpon the matter, and more eager for the marrying of mee now,
then euer heeretofore: but they shall misse of their purpose; they
shall labour it in vaine: for to what vse serues the clapper in the Mil,
if the Miller be deafe? Who is he that can remoue me from my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Who can withdraw me from my pleasure? <hi>Calisto</hi> is my Soule,
my Life, my Lord; on whom I haue set vp my rest, and in whom
I haue placed all my hopes; I know that in him I cannot be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
And since that hee loues me, with what other thing but loue
can I requite him? All the debts in the world receiue their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a diuers kind; but loue admits no other payment, but loue.
I glad my selfe in thinking on him; I delight my selfe in seeing him;
and reioyce my selfe in hearing him. Let him doe with mee what
he will, and dispose of me at his pleasure; if he will goe to Sea, I
will goe with him; if hee will round the world, I will along with
him; if he will sell mee for a slaue in the enemies Countrey, I will
not resist his desire. Let my Parents let me inioy him, if they meane
to inioy me; let them not settle their thoughts vpon these vanities,
nor thinke no more vpon those their marriages. For, it is better to
be well belou'd, then ill married; and a good friend is better then
a bad husband. Let them suffer mee to inioy the pleasure of my
youth, if they minde to iniov any quietnesse in their age; if not,
they will but prepare destruction for me, and for themselues a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.
I grieue for nothing more, then for the time that I haue
lost in not inioying him any sooner, and that hee did not know me,
as soone as he was knowne vnto me. I will no husband; I will not
fully the knots of matrimony, nor treade against the matrimoniall
steppes of another man; nor walke in the way of wedlocke with a
stranger, as I finde many haue done, in those ancient bookes
which I haue read, which were farre more discreete, and wiser then
my selfe; and more noble in their estate and Linage, whereof some
were held among the heathens for goddesses: as was <hi>Venus,</hi> the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7594:92"/>
mother of <hi>Eneas</hi> and of <hi>Cupid,</hi> the god of loue, who being married,
broke her plighted troth of wedlocke: as likewise diuers others,
who were inflamed with a greater fire, and did commit most nefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and incestuous errors: as <hi>Myrrha,</hi> with her father; <hi>Semyramis</hi>
with her sonne; <hi>Canace</hi> with her brother; others also in a more
cruell and beastly fashion, did transgresse the Law of Nature: as
<hi>Pasiphae,</hi> the wife of King <hi>Minos,</hi> with a Bull: and these were Queenes
and great Ladies, vnder whose faults (considering the foulnesse of
them) mine may passe as reasonable, without note of shame, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesty.
My loue was grounded vpon a good and iust cause, and a
farre more lawfull ground. I was wooed and sued vnto, and captiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Calisto's</hi> good deserts; being thereunto solicited by that subtil
and cunning Mistris in her Art, Dame <hi>Celestina,</hi> who aduentured her
selfe in many a dangerous Visit, before that euer I would yeeld my
selfe true prisoner to his loue. And now for this month, and more
(as you your selfe haue seene) hee hath not failed, no, not so much
as one night, but hath still scaled our garden walls, as if hee had
come to the scaling of a fort; and many times hath beene repulsed,
and assaulted it in vaine, being driuen to withdraw his siege. And
yet for all this, hee continued more constant and resolute still, and
neuer would giue ouer, as one that thought his labour to be well
bestowed. For my sake, his seruants haue beene slaine; for my sake,
hee hath wasted and consumed his substance; for my sake hee
hath fayned absence with all his friends in the City; and all
day long hee hath had the patience to remaine close prisoner in his
owne house, and onely vpon hope (wherein hee counted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>I doe my selfe wrong, to mourne thus.
Few doe visit my house; few doe passe this way.
I can heare no musicke nor stirring betimes in
the morning; I haue no amorous ditties sung
by my Louers at my windowe; there are no
frayes, nor quarrels before my doore; they do
not cut and slash one another anights for my
sake, as they were wont to doe: and that which most of all grieues
me, is, that I see neither penny nor farthing, nor any other present to
come within my doores. But for this, can I blame no body but my
selfe; my selfe only is in fault; for had I followed the counsell of her,
who is my true and faithfull Sister, when as I brought her the other
day the newes of this sad and heauy Accident, which hath brought
all this penury vpon mee, I had not liu'd alone mur'd vp betweene
two walls; nor others loathed to haue come, and seene mee. The
diuell (I thinke) makes mee to mourne thus for him, who, had I
beene dead, would scarce, perhaps, haue shed one teare for mee.
Now I dare boldly say, that <hi>Areusa</hi> told mee truth. Sister (quoth
shee) neuer conceiue, nor shew more sorrow for the misfortune, or
death of another, then he would haue done for thee. <hi>Sempronio,</hi>
had I beene dead, would haue beene ne'r a whit the lesse merry, he
would not haue wronged-his delights, nor abridged his pleasures.
And why then like a foole should I grieue and vexe my selfe, for one
that is dead and gone, and hath lost his head by order of Law?
And what can I tell, whether being a cholericke and hastly-hayre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braind
fellow as he was, he might haue killed mee too, as well as he
did that old woman, whom I reckoned of as of mine owne mother?
I will therefore by all meanes follow <hi>Arcusa's</hi> counsell, who knowes
more of the world then I doe; and goe new and then to visit her,
that I may learne something from her, how I may liue another day.
O what a sweet participation will this be? what a delightfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation?
I see it is not said in vaine; That of more worth is one
day of a wise man, then the whole life of a foole; I will therefore
put off my mourning weedes, lay aside my sorrow, dismisse my
teares, which haue hitherto bin so ready to offer their seruice to my
eyes. But sithence that it is the very first office that we doe, as soone
as we are borne, to come crying into the world; I nothing wonder
that it is so easie to beginne to cry; and so hard to leaue off. But
this may teach one wit, by seeing the hurt it does to the eyes; by
seeing that good cloathes and neat dressings, make a woman seeme
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and your Cerusses which giue women such a pure white &amp; red, what
are they, but a slimy clinging thing, a kind of bird-lime, wherewith
men are taken and insnared? Come then thou my glasse, come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againe vnto me; and thou to my <hi>Antimonium;</hi> for I haue too
much already wronged my eyes, &amp; almost marr'd my face, with my
blubbring &amp; weeping. I will on with my white Vailes, my wrought
Gorgets, my gay Garments, my more pleasing Attire, and such
other apparell, as shall speake pleasure. I will presently prouide
some Lye for my hayre, which now through neglect, hath lost it's
bright burnisht hiew. And this being done, I will count my Hens, I
will make vp my bed: for it glads a womans heart, to see things neat
and handsome about her. I will haue all well swept and made cleane
before my doore, and the streete that buts vpon it, sprinkled with
water, as well to keepe it coole, as to lay the dust; to the end, that
they who passe by, may plainely thereby perceiue, that I haue ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht

and gentle handling of him, I will quite vnmaw him, and draw from
him all that hee either knowes concerning his Master or any body
else, as hee drawes dust from his horses with his curry-combe.
What? My <hi>Sosia?</hi> My inward friend? Him whom I wish so well
vnto, though perhaps he knowes not of it? Him, whom I haue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to know, led only by the fame and good report, which I heare of
him? What? He that is so faithfull to his Master? So good a friend
to his acquaintance? I will imbrace thee (my Loue) I will hugge
thee in mine armes; for now that I see thee, I see report comes short;
and verily perswade my selfe, that there are more vertues in thee,
then I haue been told of. Fame hath been too sparing of thy praise;
come (sweet heart) let vs goe in, and sit downe in my chamber; for
it does me good to looke vpon thee. O! how thou dost resemble
my vnfortunate <hi>Parmeno!</hi> How liuely doth thy person represent
him vnto mee? This is it that makes this day to shine so cleare,
that thou art come to visit mee. Tell mee (gentle Sir) did you euer

should see him goe to water his horses, riding on their bare ridge
without a Saddle, and his naked legges hanging downe beneath his
Canuasse frocke, cut out into foure quarters; and should now see
him thus handsome, and well suited, both in his cloake, and other his

But (as it is the fashion of all you men) you neuer goe vnprouided of
such kinde of phrases as these: these false and deceitfull praises are
too common amongst you; you haue words moulded of purpose,
to serue your turne withall, and to suite your selues as you see cause,
to any woman whatsoeuer: yet for all this, am I not afraid of you,
neyther will I start, or budge from you. But I must tell you (<hi>Sosia</hi>)
by the way; this praising of me thus, is more then needs, for though
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7594:95"/>
thou shouldst co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend me, yet should I loue thee. And that thereby
thou shouldst thinke to gaine my loue, is as needlesse; for thou hast
gained it already. There are two things, which caused me (<hi>Sosia</hi>)
for to send for thee, intreating thee to take the paines to come and
see me; wherein if I finde you to double, or dissemble with mee, I
haue done with you. What they are, I will leaue them to your selfe
to relate, though I know it is for your owne good, which makes
mee to doe as I doe.</p>

that I had of the great fauors which you intend, and now do me; hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <p>My Loue, thou know'st how dearely I lou'd <hi>Parmeno.</hi>
And as it is in the Prouerbe, Hee that loues <hi>Beltram,</hi> loues any
thing that is his; all his friends were alwaies welcome vnto
mee; his good seruice to his Master did as much please mee, as
it pleased himselfe. When hee saw any harme towards <hi>Calisto,</hi>
hee did study to preuent it. Now as all this is true, so thought I it
good to accquaint thee with it. First then did I send for thee, that I
might giue thee to vnderstand how much I loue thee; &amp; how much
I ioy and euer shall, in this thy visiting mee; nor shalt thou lose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing by it, if I can helpe it, but rather turne to thy profit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.
Secondly, since that I haue setled my eyes, my loue and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on thee, that I may aduise thee to take heede how thou commest
in danger; and besides, to admonish thee, that thou doe not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
thy secrers to any: For you see what ill befell <hi>Parmeno</hi> and
<hi>Sempronio,</hi> by imparting things of secrecy vnto <hi>Celestina;</hi> for I would
not willingly see thee dye in such an ill fashion, as your fellow and
companion did; it is enough for mee that I haue bewayled one of
you already, and therefore I would haue you to know, that there
came one vnto mee, and told me that you had discouered vnto him
the loue, that is betwixt <hi>Calisto</hi> and <hi>Melibea;</hi> and how hee wanne
her; and how you your selfe night by night went along with him;
and many other things which now I cannot call to minde. Take
heede (friend) for not to keepe a secret, is proper onely vnto wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
yet not vnto all, but such as are fooles and children. Take
heede (I say) for heere-hence great hurt may come vnto you: and
to this end did Nature giue you two eares, and two eyes, and but
one tongue; to the end that what you see and heare, should be
double to that you speake. Take heede, and doe not thinke your
friend will keepe your secret, when you your selfe cannot keepe it;
when therefore thou art to goe with thy Master, <hi>Calisto,</hi> to that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
house, make no noyse, lest you be heard; for some haue told
me, that euery night you keepe a coyle, and cannot containe your
selues, as men transported and ouer-ioyed.</p>

                  <p>O what busie-bodies, and what idle-headed persons be
they who abuse your eares with such friuolous tales! whosoeuer
told you that hee heard any such matter out of my mouth, hee told
you an vntruth; and some others, perhaps, because they see me goe
anights when the Moone shines, to water my horses, whisling, and
singing, and such like kinde of mirth, to driue away care, and to
make me forget my toyling and my moyling, and all this before
tenne a clocke at night, conceiue an euill suspition; and of this
suspition, make certaineties, and affirme that to be true, which
themselues doe falsly surmize. And <hi>Calisto</hi> is not so madde, or foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
that at such an houre as that, he should goe about a businesse of
so great a consequence, but that he will first be sure that all abroad
is quiet, and that euery man reposes himselfe in the sweetenesse of
his first sleepe: and lesse are you to suppose, that hee should goe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
night vnto her; for such a duty will not endure a daily visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And that you may (Mistresse) more manifestly see their false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;

your bashfull fooles, and no better do I vse your discreeter men that

Cousin: for this is another kinde of Art then that of <hi>Celestina;</hi> it

drawing of bloud; thumping him on the brest, or making his head

and pertinacious whores as you be. Now will I bethinke my
selfe, how I may excuse my selfe of my promise; and in such sort
too, that they may be perswaded, that I vsed all possible diligence
for to execute their desire, and that it was not of negligence, for the
freeing of my selfe from danger. I will faine my selfe sicke: But
what will that profit me? for then they will be at me againe when I
am well. Againe, if I shall tell them that I haue beene there, and
that I forced them to flye, they will aske mee who they were? how
many in number, and in what place I buckled with them? and what
apparell they wore? and by what markes I knew them to be such
and such? and the diuell awhit shall I be able to tell them: And then
all the fat is in the fire. What counsell then shall I take, that may
cumply with mine own safety, and their desire? I will send for lame
<hi>Thraso,</hi> and his companions, and tell them, that because this night
I shall be otherwise imployed, they would goe and make a clattering
with their Swords and Bucklers in manner of a fray, for to feare, and
affright certaine young men, whom they shall finde in such a place,
which seruice was faithfully recommended vnto mee to execute.
This I know is a sure course, and no other hurt can follow thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
saue to make them fly, and so get them home to bed.</p>

<hi>Tristan</hi>) that passed this day, betwixt <hi>Areusa,</hi> and
my selfe, taking my selfe now to be the happiest man
in the world. Thou shalt vnderstand then, that vpon
the good report which shee heard of mee, shee fell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
in loue with mee, and sent me word by <hi>Elicia,</hi> that I would
doe her the kindnesse, as to come and speake with her. But omitting
many other speaches of good counsell, which then past betweene
vs, shee made present shew vnto mee, that shee was now as much
mine, as euer shee was <hi>Parmeno's.</hi> Shee requested mee, that I would
continually come and visit her; and that she did not doubt, but that
shee should long inioy my loue. And I sweare to thee (brother) by
that dangerous way wherein wee walke, and as euer any good may
heereafter befall mee, that twice or thrice it was as much as euer I
could doe for my life, to forbeare from boording her; but that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
shame did hinder mee, seeing her so faire, and so well clad, and
my selfe in an old Mouse-eaten cloake: still as shee moued and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
her selfe, shee did breathe forth a most sweet and redolent
odour of Muske; and I neuer stirr'd, or heau'd my body, but I sent
forth a most ranke sent of that horse-dung, which had got within
my shooes: Shee had a hand as white as snow, and euer and anon,
as she pull'd off her gloue, thou wouldst haue thought, that she had
scattered flowres of Orenges about the roome; so that as well in
regard of this, as also because at that time shee was somewhat busie,
I was content to deferre my boldnesse till another day: as likewise
because all things at the first sight are not so tractable; for the
more they are communicated, the better are they vnderstood in
their participation.</p>

them. If shee loue thee, because thou art a Gentleman; how many
better then thy selfe hath she reiected? If because thou art rich; she
knowes well enough that thou hast no other dust, then that which
clings to the Curry-combe. If because thou art nobly descended,
and of high Linage; she knowes thy name is <hi>Sosia,</hi> and so was thy

such as she are neuer to seeke, but haue them still ready in the deck,
and more perfect then their <hi>Pater noster?</hi> With this venemous
vice, shee will not sticke to damne her soule, so as shee may please
her appetite; shee would faine turne all things topsituruy, and set

desire. O Ruffianly Strumpet! O mankind Queane! With what
white bread hath shee giuen thee crooked pinnes, to choake thee?
Shee cares not now shee sells and barters her body, so as shee may

borne into the world, that should be able to depriue thee of thy
great deseruingnesse? O interrupted melody! O musick suddenly

my Lord? my soule; Is it hee? I cannot beleeue it; where hast
thou beene, thou bright shining Sunne? In what place hast thou
hid thy brightnesse from me? Is it not a pretty while since that thou
heard'st mee? Why dist thou suffer me to send forth my words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ayre, senselesse and foolish as they were, and in this hoarse
Swannish voyce of mine? looke on the Moone, and see how bright
shee shines vpon vs: looke on the Cloudes, and see how speedily
they racke away: harken to the gurgling waters of this fountaine:
how sweet a murmure, and what a pretty kind of purling they make,
rushing along these fresh herbes, and pleasant flowres: harken to
these high Cypresses, how one bough makes peace with another by
the intercession of a milde, gentle, &amp; temperate wind, which moues
them to and fro. Behold these silent and quiet shades, how darke
they are, and how excellently well prepar'd for the couering and
concealing of our sports. <hi>Lucrecia?</hi> why, how now friend? what
are you doing? art thou turn'd mad with pleasure? Let me alone
with my Loue; touch him not, I charge you; doe not you plucke

                  <p>Deare Lady, and glory of my life; if you loue me, giue
not ouer your singing; let not my presence, which glads thee, be of
a worse, and more vnfortunate condition, then my absence which

                  <p>Why (my Loue) would you haue mee sing? or how
can I sing? for my desire of thee, was that which ruled my voyce,
and made mee to ayre my notes. But now that thou art come, that
desire disappeares, it is vanished, and the Tone of my voyce dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempred,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7594:101"/>
and out of tune. And because you, Sir, are the patterne
of courtesie and good behauiour, how can you in reason require my
tongue to speake, when as you cannot rule your owne hands, and
keepe them quiet? Why doe not you forget these tricks, and learne
to leaue them? Lay your command vpon them to be quiet, and will
them to lay aside this offensiue custome, and consider (my dearest)
that as to see thee, whilest thou carriest thy selfe quietly and ciuilly,
is the greatest happinesse that eyther my heart or my eye can inioy;
so is it as displeasing vnto me, to see thee handle me so roughly. Thy
honest sporting pleaseth mee, but thy dishonest hands offend mee,
especially when they are too farre out of reason. And, though loue
ofttimes forget reason, yet amongst your well-educated, and noble
and generous spirits, kindnesse keepes a decorum, and reuels not
but with decency; let such (Sweet-heart) be our imbraces, such and
so modest be our dalliance (my dearest <hi>Calisto,</hi> my Loue, my Lord.)
And since I wholy subiect my selfe to your pleasure; be it your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
to take &amp; make such worthy benefit of my affection, presence
and seruice, as best beseemes true Louers, and is agreeable to both
our high births and breeding. But alas silly woman, why should I
direct you? No, I will not, Doe, <hi>Calisto,</hi> doe what you will, and say
what you will, I am yours to vse; please your selfe, and you shall
please mee.</p>

imbrace this thy body, to fold it within mine armes, and to haue the
possession of thy beauty. Euery where a man may eate and drinke
for his money; that a man may haue at any time; it is euery where to
be bought: but that which is not vendible, that which in all the
world is not to be matched; and saue onely in this garden, not to

What her griefe is, I know not; Nay, scarce know I her,

may haue light enough to take a full view of her. Why, how now
daughter? What's the matter? What is your paine? Where lies
it? What a strange thing is this? What faintnesse doe I see? What
weakenesse and feeblenesse? Looke vpon me, daughter! I am thy
father: Speake vnto me, for pitties sake speake; and tell mee the
cause of your griefe, that wee may the sooner prouide a remedy.
Send not my gray hayres with sorrow to the graue; thou knowest
I haue no other good but thee; no other worldly happinesse. Open
thy gladsome eyes; looke cheerefully vpon mee.</p>

of thy passion: for sorrow still assaulteth the weakest hearts,
and conquers them most, that are most cowardly: if thou wilt but
tell me thy griefe, it shall presently be remedied; for neither physick
nor Physicians, nor seruants shall be wanting, for the recouery of
thy health, whether it consist in herbes, in stones, or in words, or
remaine more secret in the bodies, and bowels of beasts. Doe not
then vexe me any more; torment me no longer; force me not out

and where is your paine?</p>

And before you can come to cure it in my heart, you must first take

goe and take some fresher ayre along by the Riuer side; come, and
make merry with your mother; you shall see, that will ease and rid

                  <p>They haue all of them left me. I am now alone by my

pat to my minde; it is some ease vnto mee, that I and my beloued
<hi>Calisto</hi> shall so soone meet againe. I will shut and make fast the dore,
that no body may come vp to hinder my death, nor disturbe my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
nor to stop me in my iourney, wherin I purpose to poast vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; not doubting, but to visit him as well this very day, as he did
mee this last night. All things fadge aright, and haue falne out as
luckily, as I could wish it; I shall now haue time and leysure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
to recount to my father <hi>Pleberio,</hi> the cause of this my short
and sudden end. I confesse, I shall much wrong his siluer hayres,
and offer much iniury to his elder yeers; I shall work great wo vnto
him by this my errour; I shall leaue him in great heauinesse and
desolation all the daies of his life: But admit my death will be the
death of my dearest parents, and put case, that the shortning of my
daies, will be the shortning of theirs; who doth not know, but that
others haue beene more cruell to their parents then I am? <hi>Prusias,</hi>
King of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> without any cause, not induring that paine, which
I doe, slew his owne father <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> slew both father
and mother, and brother and wife, and all for the loue of his Mistris.
<hi>Orestes</hi> kil'd his mother, <hi>Clytemnestar,</hi> and that cruell Emperour <hi>Nero,</hi>
onely for the fulfilling of his pleasure, murdred his owne mother.
These, and such as they, are worthy of blame. These are true <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides;</hi>
not I; who with mine owne punishment, and with mine
owne death, purge away the guilt, which otherwise, they might
moe iustly lay vpon mee for their deaths. There haue beene others,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7594:104"/>
far more cruell, who haue slaine their own children, and their owne
brothers, in comparison of whose errours, mine is as nothing; at
least nothing so great. <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon; Herod,</hi> King of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryne;
Constantine,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome; Laodice,</hi> Queene of <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea;</hi>
and <hi>Medea</hi> the Sorceresse; all these slew their owne sonnes and
dearest children, and that without any reason or iust cause, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
their owne persons still in safety. To conclude, that great
cruelty of <hi>Phr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ates,</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> occurres to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
who, because hee would haue no successour behinde him,
murdred <hi>Orodes,</hi> his aged father, as also his onely sonne, besides
some thirty more of his brethren. These were delicts worthy blame
indeed; because they keeping their owne persons free from perill,
butchered their Ancestours, their successours, and their brethren.
True it is, that though all this be so, yet are we not to imitate them
in those things wherein they did amisse; but it is not in my power
to doe otherwise. And thou great Gouernour of the heauens, who
art witnesse to my words, thou see'st the small power that I haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
my passion; thou seest how my liberty is captiuated, and how
my senses are taken with that powerfull loue of that late deceased
Gentleman, who hath depriued mee of that loue, which I beare to

Now, by and by shalt thou be suddenly wounded; thy heart shall
presently be prickt with griefe, and shall bleede abundantly, to see
the death of thy onely daughter. My end drawes neere; at hand is
my, rest, and thy passion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my ease, and thy paine; my houre of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

more heereafter to be tormented, in not knowing why I doe kill my

nor answer mee any thing; nor question me any further, then what
of mine owne accord I shall willingly tell thee; for when the heart
is surcharged with sorrow, the eare is deafe to good counsell; and
at such a time, good and wholsome words rather incense, then allay
rage. Heare (my aged father) the last words that euer I shall speake
vnto you. And if you entertaine them, as I hope you will, you will
rather excuse, then condemne my errour. I am sure, you both well
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7594:104"/>
perceiue and heare that most sad and doleful lamentation, which is
made thorowout all this City; I am sure you heare this great noyse
and ringing of bells, the skriking and cryings out of all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
this howling, and barking of dogges, this noyse and clatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Armour. Of all this, haue I beene the cause; I, euen this
very day, haue clothed the greater part of the Knights, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of this City in mourning. I, euen this very day, haue left ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
seruants orphaned, and quite destitute of a Master. I haue beene
the cause, that many a poore soule hath now lost it's almes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.
I haue beene the occasion, that the dead should haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the most complete Gentleman, for his good graces and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
that euer was borne. I haue beene the occasion, that the liuing
haue lost the onely Patterne and Paragon of courtesie, of gallant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions,
of witty deuices, of neatnesse and decency in his cloathes,
of speech, of gate, of kindnesse, and of vertue. I haue beene the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
that the earth doth now inioy the most noble body, and the
freshest flowre of youth, that euer was created in this age of ours.
And because you may stand amazed and astonished at the sound
of these my vnusuall and vnaccustomed crimes; I will open the
businesse, and make this matter appeare more cleare vnto you.</p>
                  <p>It is now (deare father) many dayes since that a Gentleman called
<hi>Calisto,</hi> whom you well knew, as likewise his Ancestors, and noble
Linage, did languish and pine away for my loue. As for his vertues
and goodnesse, they were generally knowne to the whole world.
So great was his loue-torment, and so little both place and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to speake with me, that he was driuen to discouer his passion
to a crafty and subtill woman, named <hi>Celestina,</hi> which <hi>Celestina,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
as a suiter vnto mee in his behalfe, drew my secret loue from
forth my bosome, and made mee to manifest that vnto her, which I
concealed from mine own mother; she found the meanes to win me
to her will; shee made the match betweene vs; shee plotted how
his desire and mine should take effect. And if hee dearely loued me,
I was not therein deceiued; shee made vp that sad conclusion of
that sweete and vnfortunate execution of his will; and thus being
ouer-come with the loue of <hi>Calisto,</hi> I gaue him entrance into your
house; hee scaled your walls with ladders, and brake into your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
brake my chaste purpose, by taking from mee the flowre of
my Virginity. And thus almost this moneth haue wee liu'd in this
delightfull errour of loue. And as he came this lastnight vnto mee,
as hee was wont to doe, e'en iust about the time that he should haue
returned home (as ill fortune would haue it, who in the mutability
of her nature, ordereth and disposeth all things, according to her
disordered custome) the walls being high, the night darke, the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
light and weake, his seruants that brought it, vnacquainted with
that kinde of seruice, hee going downe somewhat hastily to see a
fray, which he heard in the streete betweene his seruants and some
others that then passed by, being in choller, making more haste
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7594:105"/>
then good speed, thinking he should neuer come soone enough, not
eying well his steps, he sets his foot quite besides the rounds, and so
fell downe, and with that wofull and vnfortunate fall, hee pitcht
vpon his head, and had his braines beaten out, and dasht in pieces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the stones and pauement of the streete. Thus did the desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
cut off his thred; thus cut off his life without confession; cut
off my hope; cut off my glory; cut off my company. Things
therefore being thus; tell me (father) What cruelty were it in me,
he dying disbrained, that I should liue pained all the daies of my
life? His death inuiteth mine; inuiteth? nay, inforceth mee, that
it be speedily effected, and without delay; it teacheth mee, that I
should also fall headlong down, that I may imitate him in all things.
It shall not be said of mee, that those that are dead and gone, are
soone forgotten. And therefore I will seeke to content him in my
death, since I had not time to giue him content in my life. O my
Loue, and deare Lord, <hi>Calisto,</hi> expect mee, for now I come. But
stay a little, though thou dost expect mee; and be not angry, I
prythee, that I delay thee, being that I am now paying my last
debt, and giuing it my finall account to my aged father, to whom
I owe much more. O my best beloued father, I beseech you, if euer
you did loue mee in this painefull forepassed life, that we may both
be interred in one Tombe, and both our Obsequies be solemnized
together. I would faine speake some words of comfort vnto you,
before this my gladsome and well-pleasing end, gathered and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
out of those ancient bookes, which for the bettering of my
wit and vnderstanding, you willed me to reade, were it not that my
memory failes me, being troubled and disquieted with the losse and
death of my Loue: as also because I see your ill indured teares
trickle so fast downe your wrinckled cheekes. Recommend mee to
my most deare and best-beloued mother; and doe you informe her
at large of the dolefull occasion of my death. I am glad with all my
heart, that shee is not heere present with you; for her sight would
but increase my sorrow. Take (aged father) the gifts of old
age; for in large daies, large griefes are to be endured. Receiue the
pledge and earnest of thy reuerend age; receiue it at the hands of
thy beloued daughter. I sorrow much for my selfe, more for
you, but most for my aged mother: and so I recommend me to you
both, and both of you vnto your more happinesse, to whom I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
vp my soule; leauing the care to you, to couer this body that
is now comming downe vnto you.</p>

cryings, your vnaccustomed complaints, your mournings and great
anguish, they haue so pierced my very bowels, made so quicke a

is in the suds; our ioy is turn'd into annoy; all our conceiued
hopes are vtterly lost; all our happinesse is quite ouerthrowne; let
vs now no longer desire to liue. And because vnexpected sorrowes
leaue a greater impression of griefe; and because they may bring
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7594:106"/>
thee the sooner to thy graue; as also, that I may not alone by my
selfe bewayle that heauy losse which belongs to vs both; looke out
and behold her, whom thou broughtst forth, and I begot, dash't and
broken all to pieces. The cause I vnderstood from her selfe, but
layd open more at large, by this her sadde and sorrowfull seruant.
Helpe to lament these our latter daies, which are now growing to an
end. O yee good people, who come to behold my sorrowes, and
you Gentlemen, my louing friends, doe you also assist to bewayle
my misery! O my daughter! and my onely good! it were cruelty
in mee, that I should out-liue thee. My threescore yeeres were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the graue, then thy twenty; but the order of my dying was
altred by that extremity of griefe, which did hasten thy end. O yee
my boary hayres, growne foorth to no other end, saue sorrow; it
would better haue suted with you, to haue beene buryed in the
earth, then with these golden tresses which lye heere before mee.
Too too many are the dayes that I haue yet to liue; I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
and cry out against death; I will accuse him of delay; how
long will hee suffer mee to remaine heere after thee! Let my life
now leaue mee, since I must leaue thy sweet company. O my deare
wife, rise vp from her, and if any life be left in thee, spend that
little with mee in teares and lamentations, in sobbes, and in sighes;
but in case thy soule resteth now with hers; if out of very griefe,
thou hast left this life, why wouldst thou lay this heauy burthen on
mee? why let mee remaine heere alone, and haue no body to help
me in the vnsheathing of my sorrowes? In this, yee women haue a
great aduantage of vs that are men; for some violent griefe can
make you goe out of the world without any paine; or at least cast
you into a swound, which is some ease to your sorrowes. O the hard
heart of a father, why dost thou not burst with griefe? why doe not
your heart-strings crack in sunder, to see thy selfe bereau'd of thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
heyre? For whom didst thou build these Turrets? For whom
got I honours? For whom planted trees? For whom built ships?
O hard-hearted earth, why dost thou beare me any longer? Where
shall my disconsolate old age finde any resting place? O variable
fortune, and full of change, thou Ministresse, and high Stewardesse
of all temporall happinesse; Why didst thou not execute thy cruell
anger vpon mee? Why didst thou not ouerwhelme him with thy
mutable waues, who professes himselfe to be thy subiect? Why
didst thou not rob mee of my patrimony? Why didst thou not set
fire on my house? Why didst thou not lay waste mine inheritance?
Why didst thou not strip mee of my great reuenewes? What is't
I would not thou shouldst haue done, so as thou hadst left mee that
flourishing young plant, ouer which thou ought'st not to haue had
such power? Thou might'st, O fortune (fluctuant, and fluent as thou
art) haue giuen me a sorrowfull youth, and a mirthfull age; neyther
haue therein peruerted order. Better could I haue borne thy blowe,
better indured thy persecutions, in that my more strong, and Oaky
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7594:106"/>
age, then in this my weake and feeble declining. O life fulfill'd with
griefe, and accompanied with nought but misery! O world, world!
much haue men spoken of thee, much haue men writ concerning
thy deceits; and much haue I heard my selfe: And mine owne wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
experience is able to say something of thee, as one who haue bin
in the vnfortunate fayre, and haue often bought and sold with thee,
but neuer had any thing that succeeded happily with mee. As one
who many a time heeretofore, euen to this present houre, haue silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thy false properties, and all because I would not purchase thy
displeasure, and pull thy hatred vpon mee: and that thou shouldst
not vntimely plucke this flowre from me, which this day thou hast
cropt by the mightinesse of thy power. And therefore now will I
goe without feare, like one that hath nothing to lose; or as one to
whom thy company is now odious and troublesome; or like a
poore traueller, who fearelesse of theeues, goes singing on his way.
I thought in my more tender yeeres, that both thou and thy actions
were gouerned by order, and ruled by reason: But now I see thou
art <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con;</hi> there is no certainty in thy calmes: thou seemest
now vnto me to be a Labyrinth of errours; a fearefull wildernesse;
an habitation of wilde Beasts; a Dance full of changes; a Fen full
of mire, and dirt; a Country full of thornes; a steepe and craggy
mountaine, a field full of stones; a meddow full of Snakes and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents;
a pleasant garden to looke to, but without any fruite; a
fountaine of cares, a riuer of teares, a sea of miseries; trouble with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
profit; a sweet poyson, a vaine hope, a false ioy, and a true sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
O thou false world! thou dost cast before vs the baytes of thy
best delights, and when we haue swallowed them, they seeming sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoury
vnto vs, then doest thou shew vs the hooke that must choake
vs. Nor can we auoyd it, because together with vs, thou dost cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuate
our wills: Thou promisest mountaines, but performest
Mole-hils: and then thou dost cast vs off, that wee may not
put thee in minde of making good thy vaine promises. We runne
thorow the spacious fields of thy ranke vices, retchles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, and with
a loose reyne; and then doest thou discouer thy ambushes vnto vs,
when thou seest there is no way forvs to retreat. Many haue forsaken
thee, fearing thy sudden forsaking of them. And well may they stile
themselues happy, when they shall see, how well thou hast rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this poore heauy sorrowfull old man, for his long seruice. Thou
dost put out our eyes, and then to make vs amends, thou anointest
the place with oyle: thou breakest our head, and giuest vs a plaister;
after thou hast done vs a great deale of harme, thou giuest vs a poore
cold comfort; thou dost hurt vnto all, that no man may boast, that
others haue not their crosses as well as wee; telling them, that it is
some ease to the miserable, to haue companions in their misery.
But I alas, disconsolate old man stand all alone. I am singuler in my
sorrowes; I am grieued, and haue no equall companion of my griefe.
No mans misfortune is like vnto mine; though I reuolue in my
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7594:107"/>
troubled memory, persons both present and past, I cannot instance
in the like. If I shall seeke to comfort my selfe with the seuerity and
patience of <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> who hauing lost two sonnes in seuen
daies, bore this brunt of fortune with so vndaunted a courage, that
the people of <hi>Rome</hi> had rather neede to be comforted by him, then
he by them; yet cannot this satisfie mee, for hee had two more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
that were his adopted sonnes. What companion then will
they allot me of my misery? <hi>Pericles,</hi> that braue <hi>Athenian</hi> Captaine?
or valiant <hi>Xenophon?</hi> Tush, they lost sonnes indeed, but their sonnes
dyed out of their sight, hauing lost their liues abroad in forraine
Countries, far from home; so that it was not much for the one, not
to change countenanee, but to take it cheerefully: nor for the other
to answer the messenger, who brought him the ill tydings of his
sonnes deaths, that he should receiue no punishment, because him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
had receiued no griefe; for all this is farre differing from mine;
lesse canst thou say (thou world replenished with euill) that <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi>
and I, were alike in our losse; that wee were equall in our
griefes: and that I should say of my dead daughter, as he did of his
onely sonne, when he said; Being that I was mortall, I knew, that
he whom I had begot was to die. For my <hi>Melibea,</hi> willingly, and out
of her owne election, killed her selfe before mine eyes, inforced
thereunto through the extreme passion of her loue, so great was
her torment; whereas his sonne was slaine in battell, in a iust and
lawfull warre. O incomparable losse; O most wretched and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
old man that I am! who the more I seeke after comfort, the
lesse reason doe I finde for my comfort; for much more miserable
doe I finde my misfortune, and doe not so much grieue at her death,
as I doe lament the manner of her death. Now shall I lose together
with thee (most vnhappy daughter) those feares, which were dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wont to affright mee. Onely thy death is that which makes mee
secure of all suspitions and iealousies. What shall I doe, when I
shall come into thy chamber, and thy withdrawing roome, and shall
finde it solitary and empty? What shall I doe, when as I shall call
thee, and thou shalt not answer me? Who is he that can supply that
want which thou hast caused? Who can stop vp that great breach in
my heart which thou hast made? Neuer any man did lose that which
I haue lost this day. Thogh in some sort, that great fortitude of <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas
de Auria,</hi> Duke of <hi>Genoa,</hi> seemeth to sute with my present estate
and condition, who seeing his sonne was wounded to death, tooke
him and threw him with his owne armes foorth of the shippe into
the sea. But such kinde of deaths as these, though they take away
life, yet they giue reputation; and many times, men are inforced to
vndergoe such actions, for to cumply with their honour, and get
themselues fame and renowne. But what did inforce my daughter
to dye, but onely the strong force of loue? What remedy now,
(thou flattering world) wilt thou affoord my wearisome age? How
wouldst thou haue me to rely vpon thee, I knowing thy falsehoods,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7594:107"/>
thy gins, thy snares, and thy nets, wherein thou intrap'st and takest
our weake and feeble wills? Tell me, what hast thou done with my
daughter? where hast thou bestow'd her? who shall accompany my
disaccompanied habitation? who shall cherish me in mine old age?
who with gentle vsage shall cocker my decaying yeeres? O Loue,
Loue, I did not thinke thou hadst had the power to kill thy subiects!
I was wounded by thee in my youth: did passe thorow the midst of
thy flames. Why didst thou let me scape? Was it that thou might'st
pay me home (for my flying from thee then) in mine old age? I had
well thought, that I had bin freed from thy snares, when I once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to growe towards forty; and when I rested contented with my
wedded consort, and when I saw I had that fruit, which this day
thou hast cut down, I did not dreame that thou would'st in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
haue taken vengeance of the parents; and I know not whether
thou woundest with the sword, or burnest with fire. Thou leauest
our clothes whole, and yet most cruelly woundest our hearts; thou
makest that which is foule, to seeme fayre and beautifull vnto vs.
Who gaue thee so great a power? who gaue thee that name which
so ill befitteth thee? If thou wert Loue, thou wouldst loue thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants;
and if thou didst loue them, thou wouldst not punish them as
thou dost. If to be thy fellow, were to liue merrily, so many would
not kill themselues, as my daughter now hath, &amp; infinit of vs. What
end haue thy seruants and their Ministers had? as also that false
Bawd, <hi>Celestina,</hi> who dy'd by the hands of the faithfullest compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that euer she lighted vpon in her life, for their true performance
in this thy venomous &amp; impoisoned seruice? They lost their heads;
<hi>Calisto,</hi> he brake his necke; and my daughter, to imitate him, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her selfe to the selfe-same death. And of all this thou wast the
cause; they gaue thee a sweete name; but thy deedes are exceeding
sowre: thou dost not giue equall rewards; and that Law is vniust,
which is not equall alike vnto all. Thy voyce promiseth pleasure, but
thy actions proclaime paine; happy are they who haue not knowne
thee, or knowing thee, haue not cared for thee. Some ledde with, I
know not what error, haue not stickt to call thee a god; But I would
haue such fooles as these to consider with themselues, it sauors not of
a Deity, to murder or destroy those that serue and follow him. O
thou enemy to all reason! To those that serue thee least, thou giuest
thy greatest rewards, vntill thou hast brought them at last into this
thy troublesome dance. Thou art an enemy to thy friends, and a
friend to thy enemies; and all this is, because thou dost not gouerne
thy selfe according to order &amp; reason. They paint thee blind, poore,
and young; they put a Bowe into thy hand, wherein thou drawest,
and shootest at random; but more blind are they that serue thee. For
they neuer taste or see the vnsauory &amp; distastful recompence, which
they receiue by thy seruice; thy fire is of hot burning lightning,
which scorches vnto death, yet leaues no impression or print of any
wound at all. The sticks which thy flames consume, are the soules
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7594:108"/>
and liues of humane creatures, which are so infinit, and so number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
that it scarce accurreth vnto me, with whom I should first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
not only of <hi>Christians,</hi> but of <hi>Gentiles</hi> &amp; of <hi>Iewes;</hi> and all fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ooth
in requitall of their good seruices. What shall I speak of that <hi>Macias</hi>
of our times; and how by louing, he came to his end? Of whose sad
and wofu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l death, thou wast the sole cause. What seruice did <hi>Paris</hi>
do thee? What <hi>Helena?</hi> What <hi>Clytemnestra?</hi> What <hi>Aegisthus?</hi> All the
world knowes how it went with them. How well likewise didst thou
requite <hi>Sapho, Ariadne,</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> and many other besides, whom
I willingly silence, because I haue enough to do in the repetition of
mine own misery? I complaine me of the world, because I was bred
vp in it; for had not the world giuen me life, I had not therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<hi>Melibea;</hi> not being begot, shee had not beene borne; not being
borne, I had not lou'd her; and not louing her, I should not haue
mourned, as now I do, in this my latter and vncomfortable old age!
O my good companion! O my bruised daughter, bruised euen all to
pieces! Why wouldst thou not suffer me to diuert thy death? why
wouldst thou not take pitty of thy kinde and louing mother? why
didst thou shew thy selfe so cruell against thy aged father? why
hast thou left me thus in sorrow? why hast thou left me comfortlesse,
and all alone, <hi>in hâc lachrimarum valle,</hi> in this vaile of teares, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
