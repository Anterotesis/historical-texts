            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHilſt Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> finds many Lets and Diſcouragements to go through with the ſolid Hiſtory of the Plot, he hath been importuned by nothing more then his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards this poor Witneſs to part with and permit, and aſſiſt him to publiſh in Print theſe his Papers, the Originals whereof received from him at ſeveral times are ſtill in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Cuſtody, Written in his own Hand.</p>
            <p>The Collections the Doctor prepared for the other 3 parts, namely, his Diſcoveries and Demonſtrations of the Jeſuites acting in this Plot, as Aſſaſſines, Regicides and Incendiaries are already in the Preſs, on deſigns of like Charity, and to the end, that if he ſhall be ſtill diſenabled or diſappointed in his publication of his intended Hiſtory, Poſterity may have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground, to believe, publiſh to the World, and relate to all Ages, the Bloody, Treacherous, and Ungrateful practices of theſe reſtleſs beautefewes, againſt the moſt Gracious Princes, King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, and his Majeſty that now lives, (an unparallell'd Miracle of Gods wonderful and merciful Providence,) and againſt the Churches and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, wherein they did or might have lived, with as much liberty and leſs ſuſpicion at leaſt, as ſome diſſenting Proteſtants, had they known any moderation.</p>
            <p>If we find theſe have favourable entertainment, we ſhall be encouraged to proceed to other parts, which the Doctor hath provided as materials for his Hiſtory, and may with better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as we hope, to the Publick, be diſperſed into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hands by the Preſs, then concealed for his own uſe only in his private Papers.</p>
            <p>And it is hoped, that whilſt the Doctor thus waves both his Credit and Profit, with a greater reſpect to Charity and Publick Good, it will not be expected that theſe things ſhould appear in any other dreſs, than that of their native ſimplicity.</p>

            <head>To the Honourable, the Committee of the Houſe of Commons, appointed for the Examinations of the Popish Conſpiracies.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Commend unto you this plain Relation of the firſt Diſcovery of the Popiſh plotted Conspiracy for ſubverting the Government and Religion, and Maſſacring the People of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and other his Majeſties Dominions, and the aſſaſſinating his Royal Perſon: as I drew it up (for my own ſatisfaction) out of ſeveral pieces at ſeveral times; and of the firſt Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers thereof; according to the notices I have been able to procure of them, and ſo far as they are willing to be known.</p>
            <p>You will be pleaſed to excuſe the rudeneſs and imperfection thereof: it is one part of a large rough draught of the general Narrative which I have in hand, and wherein I propoſe to my ſelf to omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I conceive may by your Wiſdom and diligence improved, conduce to the clearing the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſincerity, integrity, ingenuity, candor or truth of the Witneſſes produced, or to be produced in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, or for the diſcovery of any matter of fact or circumſtance that may tend to the diſcloſing of this Conſpiracy, or any, the Conſpirators therein, or any further evidence againſt them, or refuting the Scandals, Lyes, Aequivocations, Forgeries, Briberies, Subornations and Perjuries, wherewith they ſo mightily impoſe upon Multitudes of People, darken the cleareſt Evidences, and contradict moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly the trueſt Narratives.</p>
            <p>I know ſome minute Circumſtances and paſſages, and ſuch as relate to ſome accidental occurrences by which theſe things were brought to Light (which I have purpoſely inſerted to refute ſome ſtudied Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, repreſenting them as politick contrivances) are lyable to exceptions, and ſiniſter interpretations of ſome concerned perſons, but thoſe who are candid, will find therein cauſe to give God all the Glory: Who by the accidental Circumſtances of undeſigned, uncontrived events diſcovers, diſciphers, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays ſuddenly the long projected, moſt craftily contrived, deeply hid, and vigorouſly proſecuted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt machinations of wicked Politicians and Conſpirators againſt his ſecret purpoſes. By theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> next to nothing, and many times meerly imaginary appearances, jealouſies and panick fears, he rejoyceth to expoſe to contempt, and render altogether ridiculous and ineffectual what in all humane appearance was wiſely deſigned and ſtrongly built; and as he firſt made all things out of, ſo he often ſhakes Heaven and Earth with things that do not appear; whilſt he chuſeth not the mighty and wiſe of the World to confound ſuch as themſelves, and frequently catcheth moſt ſubtle Machiavellian Politicians in the crafty Snares they have laid, and the deadly Pits they have digg'd for others, <hi>&amp;c. Not unto us, not unto us, but to thy Name be the Praiſe. So let all thy Enimies Periſh, O God.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>The Right Reverend Father in God, <hi>Herbert,</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> had long ſince ſome notice of this Plot, either from the Information or Depoſitions of <hi>Mr. Robert Woodhouſe, Richard Green,</hi> and ſeveral others (made about <hi>Whitſuntide 1676.</hi> at <hi>Hereford,</hi> before <hi>Sir James Bridges</hi> (now <hi>Lord Shandoes)</hi> and other Juſtices of the Peace of the County of <hi>Hereford,</hi> by Order of his Majeſty, upon a report ſpread in thoſe parts of change of Government and inſurrections of Papiſts: which Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Depoſitions were by the ſaid Juſtices ſent up to his Majeſtie, and <hi>Captain Thomas Bowyer</hi> was committen to Priſon upon them) or elſe from other perſons, or by other means, as his words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will ſhew, taken out of his Epiſtle prefixed to his Legacy, Printed <hi>Anno Domini 1678,</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated or directed to his Dioceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IT is now a year and half ſince</hi> (viz. in the year <hi>1676.) I told you of my ſad apprehenſions of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Deſign, to deſtroy both us and our Religion, for though no particular diſcovery could then be made, yet the diſcourſe and actings of ſeveral Papiſts in theſe parts did plainly ſhew they were then preparing that which is now diſcover'd, for they were then providing Horſes and Arms, they po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted about Day and Night, they threatned many, That they muſt ere long Turn or Burn; and ſome told their Friends, That if it came to Cutting of Throats, they ſhould be ſaved; which made it evident, that not only they had ſome bloody deſign, but alſo thought themſelves ſure to effect it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I beſought you to Arm your ſelves againſt the day of Tryal: and Preached a Sermon to that effect. And not knowing what kind of Paſtor you might have after my Death, whether a Proteſtant Paſtor not well verſt in ſuch matters, or a Popiſh Paſtor wholly Devoted to them; I reſolved at my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, to leave you theſe Sermons as a Legacy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Upon chance within the ſpace of one year ſince, I met with Mr. <hi>Boyer,</hi> walking along his Grounds, and after we had greeted each other according to the time of the Day, <hi>Boyer,</hi> asked me, What News? <hi>Green,</hi> told him, I heard not any, I pray, what have you heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Boyer</hi> anſwered, I have heard none, but that the Parliament is adjourned: <hi>Green</hi> asked him, What they had done, <hi>Boyer,</hi> told me nothing at all; but they were about to make a moſt unreaſonable Act: <hi>Green,</hi> asked him what it was; <hi>Boyer</hi> told him, it was that which he had told me of, which was to ſettle the Inheritance of the Crown upon a Proteſtant Succeſſor: <hi>Green</hi> asked him, if the Parliament would have made ſuch an Act, I pray you what did hinder them, and <hi>Boyer</hi> told me, that all the Parliament were not ſo enclined, but only a factious party of them, in hatred towards the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> becauſe he is a Papiſt; <hi>Green</hi> told him, that I wiſhed the Succeſſion of the Crown might be ſettled whilſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty doth live, to prevent a Bloody Diſpute, which is very much feared by many will be, except the Succeſſion of the Crown be ſettled: after which <hi>Boyer</hi> told me, that the Crown after the Death of his Majeſty, doth abſolutely belong to the Duke of <hi>York. Green</hi> asked him, How could that be, being that the King hath a Son, which is the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whom all the Proteſtants which I have heard ſpeak thereof, do declare to be his Fathers lawful Heir. <hi>Boyer</hi> told me, that is not, nor cannot be: <hi>Green,</hi> wiſhed him to take heed what he ſaid, for the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> is Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, for Mr. <hi>Benge</hi> of <hi>Pembridge,</hi> told me, that a very honeſt Gentleman told him, that a Biſhop told him, he married his Majeſty to the Duke of <hi>Monmouths</hi> Mother; <hi>Boyer</hi> ſaid, I do not ſay the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> is a Baſtard, but the Objection is, that the King was not married to his Mother with the Conſent of the Parliament; <hi>Green</hi> told him, that their Objection I ſuppoſed, would ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy little or nothing: for if there be a difference between the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the Parliament do not ſettle it, I believe that all the Proteſtants in <hi>England</hi> will adventure their Blood, before the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſhall loſe his Birthright, and we loſe the liberty of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too: and <hi>Boyer</hi> anſwered, And we will adventure all our Lives and Fortunes in the behalf of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and for the Intereſt of our Religion: <hi>Green</hi> asked him, what can you do, for you be nothing to us, ſaid <hi>Boyer,</hi> Do not you think ſo, for although we be but thin here, yet there be many in other places, and powerful perſons too: I will raiſe a Company; ſaid <hi>Green</hi> of what? <hi>Boyer</hi> ſaid of Horſe: <hi>Green,</hi> asked him how many his Company ſhould be? <hi>Boyer</hi> ſaid, an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: <hi>Green,</hi> ſaid unto him, by that time you have bought an Hundred Horſes, and armed an Hundred men, I ſuppoſe you will make a great breach in your Eſtate: then <hi>Boyer</hi> turned himſelf to me, and ſaid, I believe I can Raiſe and Arm Threeſcore well, and do my ſelf no harm, what think you? but ſaid <hi>Green,</hi> where is your Commiſſion: ſaid <hi>Boyer,</hi> I am now gotten into the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of them, by whoſe aſſiſtance I can obtain a Commiſſion from the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> aſſoon as another can: and this Diſcourſe was ended in a Meadow, called the Mill Meadow, with his Face towards a Style, between that and a piece of Ground, called the <hi>Low Furlong,</hi> at the Weſt end of <hi>Luntlows</hi> Mill Garden, preſently after the long Prorogation of Parliament for 15 months or more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> This agrees well with Mr. <hi>Ieniſons</hi> Relation of a Commiſſion promiſed him. And ſhews by the Proportion, this Captain out of a ſmall Eſtate, propoſed to raiſe what Numbers they would have had to Cut our Throats, had not God prevented their Deſign of Aſſaſſinating his Majeſty, the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of this Maſſacre. And here it may be noted by what falſe, ſly, and pernicious Suggeſtions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations, the Jeſuits ſow the Seeds of Sedition and Rebellion in the Minds of ſimple and well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons of all Degrees; as here in the preſent Caſe, pretending and raiſing falſe Titles to the

Crown, and thereby dividing the Loyal Subjects thereof into bloody feuds and reſolutions: which practices are dangerous to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> above all others, whoſe People, as may be ſeen in the Example of this Informant, a poor Weaver from the Yeoman to the meaneſt Mechanick, are all ſenſible of, and concerned for the publick Affairs; and therefore are (as a Wiſe Gentleman long ſince obſerve) the only Kingdom of Gentry in the World, without mixture of Slaves, all Intelligent of, and touched as Gentlemen in other Countries with, and ready to aſſiſt with their Perſons and Eſtates in all publick Extremities.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Rowland Stanly</hi> about two years ſince about <hi>Lady day,</hi> 1677. held a like Diſcourſe, concerning the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Monmouth,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Becket,</hi> by which it appears, this pretence of their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre was univerſally laid, how little ſoever it may be believed or conſidered by ſome concerned, to lull us aſleep.</p>

               <p>I omitted this on purpoſe, becauſe I looked upon it to be one of their Jeſuitical Forgeries, whereby they thought to encourage Proteſtants that were but weak Principled, to become their Proſelytes, and alſo to animate and provoke to Rebellion againſt the Kings Sacred Perſon, and Eſtabliſhed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment all theſe Phanatical partyes, which they by their Buſy, Subtle, and Deviliſh Policies, have torn, rent and divided from our Communion.

I went in with my Information, and then after that, the Juſtices had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times met together upon the ſame Concern, the ſaid <hi>Boyer</hi> was committed to Priſon, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main until the next great Aſſize: and We the Witneſſes, <hi>Edward Price, Robert Woodhouſe,</hi> Gent. and <hi>Richard Greene</hi> were bound over to the ſame, to juſtify our Evidence in his Majeſties behalf againſt Mr. <hi>Boyer,</hi> before the Judge of the Aſſize, to which accordingly we all very diligently gave our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. But Judge <hi>Wilde</hi> who rode that Circuit, called the ſaid <hi>Boyer,</hi> and did not trouble himſelf (as was expected in a buſineſs of that weight) to examine either the Priſoner or the Witneſſes, but told him that he had read the Depoſitions againſt him, and that therein he did find that he had ſpoke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous Words, and did very ſharply chide him, and told him it did not become ſuch a one as him to talk of the overturning of Kingdoms, and of the carrying on of the changing of Governments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he might by the Law take a ſeverer Courſe with him; but becauſe he was a young man, he would only bind him to his good Behaviour, and therefore bid him produce his ſurety quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and he the ſaid <hi>Boyer,</hi> as before knowing the iſſue thereof, produced two Papiſts for his Suretyes ſtanding by him ready for the ſame purpoſe. Which binding of him, was but a letting of him looſe, (as it did afterwards appear) to ſpit his Popiſh Venom at poor <hi>Richard Greene,</hi> which he and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices did to the purpoſe; for they Proſecuted me with four malitious Law Suits, and Threatned me with many more, and at laſt, wrongfully Impriſoned me: and both before I went to Priſon, and in the Priſon, he demanded nothing of me, but Submiſſion and Recantation; and to declare thoſe Truths which I before upon Oath had Witneſſed againſt him, were Falſe, and to Acknowledg that I had done him Wrong thereby; and that by doing ſo, I may expect his love and favour as formerly: and in not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, I ſhould never come out of Priſon, which though I never did; yet I am out of Priſon, Thanks be to God; but when I came out I was ſo much impoveriſhed, ſo much Threatned, ſo much Slandered, and ſo much forſaken of Friends (for many ſought to merit the favour of my Adverſaries by doing me Injuries) by which I was forced to ſell my Goods and Cattle; and, my Wife my fellow Sufferer with me in all this, took our flight together from our Native Country.</p>

               <p>ABout <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> one <hi>Thomas Woodhouſe</hi> of <hi>Standbeach</hi> in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> Hatter, bringing <hi>Richard Greene</hi> a Hat, ſaid, My Brother <hi>Robort Woodhouſe</hi> was in a great deal of trouble about Mr. <hi>Boyer</hi> (aforeſaid) and very ſorry he had occaſioned him to be queſtioned for Words ſpoken to him. <hi>Greene</hi> queſtioned <hi>Thomas Woodhouſe</hi> about what time the Words were ſpoken by Mr. <hi>Boyer</hi> to Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Woodhouſe,</hi> the ſaid Hatters Brother, and he found by him that it was the ſame time that he the ſaid <hi>Greene</hi> had the ſame conference with Captain <hi>Thomas Boyer,</hi> viz. <hi>Ianuary</hi> 75/6. which confirmed him more in his fear of a Maſſacre. <hi>Thomas Woodhouſe</hi> related this Diſcourſe with <hi>Greene</hi> to his Brother <hi>Robert,</hi> who ſent for him to ſpeak with him, and <hi>R. W.</hi> related that <hi>Boyer</hi> had told him, there would be many Bloody Noſes that Summer, but a hair of his Head ſhould not be touched, and that the ſaid <hi>Boyer</hi> would raiſe a Troop of Horſe for the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and enquired what <hi>Boyer</hi> had ſpoken to him; <hi>Greene</hi> replyed, he would be excuſed; Then <hi>Woodhouſe</hi> ſaid, he would have him Summoned to <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> where he was himſelf to appear the next day; to this he replyed, he ſcorned to be forced to Witneſs for his King and Country, if he would lend him a Horſe, he would go with him, and accordingly he did, and teſtifyed his knowledge in the Particulars aforeſaid, before the Juſtices of the Peace, then and there aſſembled as hath been related above.</p>
               <p>And then it was <hi>(viz.</hi> about <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> 1676.) that the ſaid <hi>Robert Woodhouſe, Richard Greene,</hi> and ſeveral others were examined before Sir <hi>Iames Bridges</hi> now Lord <hi>Shandoes,</hi> and other Juſtices of the Peace of the County of <hi>Hereford,</hi> as aforeſaid; upon whoſe examinations the ſaid Captain <hi>Tho. Boyer</hi> was committed to Priſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, That againſt the ſaid Aſſizes following when the ſaid <hi>Richard Greene</hi> attended to give Evidence againſt Captain <hi>Thomas Boyer,</hi> he had reſerved many conſiderable particulars of his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61362:6"/>
evidence againſt the time of the Tryal, to which he expected that Captain <hi>Boyer</hi> would have been then brought in the face of the whole County. So that the Depoſitions taken before the ſaid Juſtices are not ſo full as theſe Informations in ſeveral particulars,</p>
               <p>Judge <hi>Wilde</hi> who went that Circuit at that Aſſizes, never ſuffered any Witneſſes to be produced or examined againſt Captain <hi>Boyer</hi> (as is ſaid) but only ſaid he had read the <hi>Affidavits,</hi> and ordered him to be bound to his Good Behaviour. Let it be examined by whoſe Order or Advice he ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the evidence of ſo horrid a Maſſacre, its probable ſome of them in queſtion did contrive thus to Suppreſs this Diſcovery, their Names alſo who beſpoke the other Caſes of Holſters ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as probably Conſcious and agents in this Suppreſſion.</p>
               <p>That by this means <hi>Greenes</hi> Evidence being Suppreſſed, the Diſcovery which he deſigned upon his Oath to make in the face of the County of a general Maſſacre of all Proteſtants, of what Profeſſion ſoever, and that univerſally over all the Kingdom to be made by the Papiſts Armed and Conſpired together in that Plot, was Concealed in a great part, and the Papiſts thereby encouraged to go on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince more confidently and fiercely in their Plot both againſt the Kings Life, whoſe Death was their Signal, and againſt all his Proteſtant Subjects that were to be Maſſacred thereupon, as far as the Papiſts Swords could reach, and thoſe whom the Maſſacre reach't not weakned thereby, were to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued and cut off by War and Foreign Aſſiſtance, under the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Authority.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Iune</hi> 1678. about the 20th. day, a little before the Parliament was Prorogued Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Parliament with ſome Propoſitions for ſuppreſſing of Popery, and relief of the Poor, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened accidentally into the Company of <hi>Richard Greene,</hi> with whom he entred ſome Diſcourſe about promoting the Linnen Manufacture, and his, the Doctors employing ſo many poor Women to Spin, as might find the ſaid <hi>Greene</hi> conſtant Work, but found he had ſold his Loomes, and fled his Country for fear of the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>That upon this occaſion <hi>Greene</hi> related the whole Plot unto Dr. <hi>Tonge,</hi> and his Sufferings occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the diſcovery thereof, and the accidental manner of his being brought for an Evidence againſt his kind Kinſman and Landlord, and great confident by Mr. <hi>Woodhouſe.</hi> Then out of Compaſſion to the ſaid <hi>Greene,</hi> and for encouragement of the like Diſcoverers and Diſcoveries for the future, Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> adviſed the ſaid <hi>Greene</hi> to complain to the Parliament then ſitting in a grand Committee for ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Popery, drew him a Petition and Articles out of his, the ſaid <hi>Greenes</hi> own information, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him how to deliver it, and leaſt by any accident he might miſcarry, wrote a note for him to the Door keeper, to call out ſome worthy member to receive his Petition, and followed him himſelf to the Houſe, and ſaw his Papers delivered into Sir <hi>Trevor Williams</hi> hand, and heard they were read in the Grand Committee.</p>
