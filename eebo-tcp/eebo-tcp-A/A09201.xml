            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Eum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> borne at a Towne called <hi>Wrangle</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> are very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently descended, for they can produce their Pedigree, from shortly after the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tower of <hi>Babel. Plutus</hi> was the first of their Family, who tooke to Wife <hi>Eris,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> Lord Chiefe justice, and judge of Hell; shee was a woman of a very contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spirit, eager of Revenge for the smallest wrong done unto her, shee was a slaunderer of all good Actions, a deadly enemy to Charity,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14709:4"/>
but most of all she hated Vnity and Amity among neighbours and friends: if shee held in with any, they were Witches and Southsaiers, for, of all others, these were most inward with her, and of her counsell, by whose assistance shee did much mischiefe in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutus</hi> had by her foure Sonnes, and three Daughters; who sucking their Mothers manners, with her milke, grew so quarrelsome and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, that one house could not hold them, but needs they would betake, and divide themselves, into the foure parts of the world, <hi>viz. Europe, Africa, Asia,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> where since their Posterity is growne so numerous, that you shall come no where, but you shall finde whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Citie, sprivate Families, and persons at ods, and together by the eares, upon one occasion or other.</p>
            <p>And without question, a race of this Family have beene in our Country of Great <hi>Britaine</hi> ever since it was first inhabited, ever and anon disturbing the peace and quiet thereof, (though it hath laien undiscovered) even from the <hi>Triar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi> after <hi>Brute</hi> (if you beleeve there was a <hi>Brute</hi>) unto the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> so to the <hi>Heptarchie</hi> of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the comming in of the <hi>Danes,</hi> after of the <hi>Normans,</hi> to our present times.</p>
            <p>And to make this probable, not many yeares agoe, there was an ancient man, whose name was <hi>Harpax,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Wrangle</hi> aforesaid; whose ancestors, as hee said, were <hi>Welchmen,</hi> and could derive their pedigree from presently after <hi>Noah's</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:14709:4"/>
flood; and oft he would report, that they were the most ancient Gentlemen of that part of the Country where they dwelt; but so apt to quarrell one with the other, and to set whole Countries and Kingdomes at oddes, that, what with mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all brabbles, and many times single Duels, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by siding with contrary factions, (as the houses of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi>) they in time were worne out, that onely himselfe and another bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (who went to live farre North) were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining alive.</p>
            <p>Vpon what occasion <hi>Harpax</hi> left <hi>Wales,</hi> to come to live in those parts, it is unknowne; it may be the goodnesse of the Soile, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Fenne on the one side, and the Sea <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes</hi> (so commodious for feeding of sheepe) on the other, were the motives of his leaving Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous <hi>Wales:</hi> but howsoever the matter is not great.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Harpax</hi> was extreamely, and beyond measure covetous, and miserable, and as great an Vsurer as was in those parts, beloved of none, but equally hated of poore and rich; for it was never knowne that hee gave an almes at his dore, or elsewhere, in all his life. I have heard, that when hee was made Church-Warden of his Parish, he collected tenne Grotes to a Breve, for a Towne that was burned in Yorkshire; and hereof hee reserved sixteene pence to himselfe. Hee never would eate Butter with his Egge, so long as it was at three pence the pound in <hi>Wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>flet</hi> Market; for hee thought the price too high.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14709:5"/>
And at the beginning of winter, because the Draper should not be a gainer by him, hee would hang Dogges for their Skinnes, and suite himselfe with their Leather.</p>
            <p>His wife was as bad, or rather worse; and tooke upon her to tell of things that were stollen, or lost; whereby she deceived a number of poore people, taking of them Bacon, a Cheese, a Hen, or such like, for telling them in whose possession they were, and by whom they were conveighed away, accusing those that were innocent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, much trouble and discord arose among neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, yet none durst question her for the same, for her husband was rich, and consequently, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, and able to prevaile with those, who should reforme these and such like abuses</p>
            <p>This <hi>Harpax</hi> and his wife, had onely two sonnes, who were twinnes, borne at one birth; who not a whit degenerating from their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors; for shortly after their birth, they would seeme to wrangle for the Mothers breast, and growne bigger, they would scratch and take hold one of another; then, after two or three yeares, fall out about milke, bread and butter; and growne great boyes, at play about counters, or points, insomuch, as they never were without blew eyes, or scratched faces; and so unhappy they were, that no other Children would keepe them company; yea, they were charged so to doe by their Parents, if they meant to live in quiet, and keepe their estates, when they were men. On the working dayes (for at home they had little to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14709:5"/>
doe) they used to goe with fisher men to the Sea, whom they made to fall out daily, about setting their stakes, removing of nets, and division of their fish. Faires and Markets they haunted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and set Gentlemen, playing at Cards or Tables, at difference about a chance throwne, laying downe a stake, or a deal'd Card mistaken, and the like. Nay, they set their owne Father and Mother at ods, in so much not they, but the whole Country grew weary of them. Old <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pax</hi> thought, if they stayed at home continually with him, they would eate him out of dores; the Mother thought, they might bring her in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a Witch, and so to a shamefull end; the Parish intended, at the next presse to have packed them away for Souldiers: but a Gentleman of good ranke, and one who had been abroad, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Parish, would not agree hereunto; for (quoth he) they are by nature so contentious and quarelsome, they will raise a mutinie, and so overthrow the whole Army.</p>
            <p>In briefe, their Father resolved to be troubled no longer with them, but to send them into the world, to seeke their fortunes, and rather forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with while the Summer lasted, the weather was faire, the daies long, and (if extremity constrained them) while there was meanes to get something in the field, as by Hay-making, sheepe-shearing, shocking of Corne, pitching the Cart, and the like; hereupon, aswell for lightnesse in hot wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as saving his money, he clad each of them in a parchment suite, made of old Bonds and Leases
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14709:6"/>
out of date; the large blacke lines served for lace, and the waxen seales for buttons; for hats they had two old <hi>Monmouth</hi> Caps their father brought out of <hi>Wales,</hi> wherein they stuck a Fen-Cats-taile or two; weapons they had none, save each of them a broome staffe in his hand, with some small summe of money in their pockets: and thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coustred, out of dores they goe (without either asking their Parents blessing, or once bidding them farewell) on their intended voiage, bidding their sweete and native soile of <hi>Wrangle</hi> (for how long they knew not) a friendly adieu.</p>
            <p>To make a Topographicall description of this Towne, (by way of digression) it standeth seven miles beyond <hi>Villam Butolphi,</hi> alias, <hi>Boston,</hi> at the hither end of the spacious and fruitfull Marsh, well knowne for the plenty of the biggest and fattest sheepe of <hi>England;</hi> it is adjoyning to that arme of the Sea, called by <hi>Ptolomey, Metaris Aestuarium;</hi> it was sometime a Market Towne, and in the time of <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> it had a faire Haven, which since the Sea hath forsaken, and is now toward the Sea filled up with sand, and upon Land become a deepe valley, wherein grasse groweth, and is common for their sheepe. But to returne to <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum:</hi> away they went, not gone many miles, but they fell together by the eares, about a shoeing-horne; <hi>Tuum</hi> averring that it was given him by his Mother, in stead of her blessing; <hi>Meum</hi> protested it was his Fathers, and hee had kept it ever since he was married, they could not agree about it; in briefe, after many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14709:6"/>
bitter and unbrotherly words, they resolved one to leave the other; so <hi>Meum</hi> went one way by Sea over to the <hi>Icenians,</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> by land another: but see how it happened, after some three weeks absence one from the other, it was <hi>Tuum's</hi> hap to come to the same Towne, among the <hi>Icenians,</hi> where <hi>Meum</hi> had placed himselfe with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of a Spirituall Court thereabout; this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor dwelt in a Parsonage, which hee farmed of an old Parson, who was a Batchelor, and had beene a Priest in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time; keeping onely a Curat to reade prayers. The Proctor finding <hi>Meum</hi> to bee pregnant and witty, taught him the grounds aswell of the Civill as common Law, caused the Curate to reade the Grammar unto him, that being grounded in the Latine, he might be fitted as a Clerke or Notarie to write under him: the Curat, I must tell you, was no great Scholler, or ever graduate in any Vniversity, but w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> long teaching <hi>Schole</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> he became perfect in his ruls: preach he could not, neither lay he in the parsonage house (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was miserably fallen to ruine, the Barnes, Stables, and Dove-coat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely propped up, and both unwalled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiled) but hee had a Flock-bed upon a pallet in the Steeple of the <hi>Church,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was both his Chamber and his Study; the Presse wherein hee laid those books he had were holes in the walls, where Iack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Dawes had formerly bred; neither did the Bells trouble his study, or his sleep, for they rang not to prayers from one end of the weeke to another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon the <hi>Sunday,</hi> and then not till ten a clock.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14709:7"/>
               <hi>Meum</hi> being thus entertained, and having gotten an handsome blacke suite, which his Maister be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him; hee became in no long tract of time very skilfull in his practise, and marvellous cunning in the way of suing and citing men into the Court, for the least misdemeanour, as it shall by the sequell appeare. Newes was brought to the Proctor his Maister, how that a Farmer in the Parish had sold a Sow and eleven young Pigges, on purpose to cheate him of his tyth: <hi>Meum</hi> drawes a citation, to call this man to answer it the next Court day at <hi>Icenium. Tuum</hi> in the meane time, was by strange fortune entertained by an Attorney dwelling in the same Parish, but a mile and an halfe off from the Church, who also tooke a great liking unto him, and made him an under Clerke under another, that hee might get experience, learne to make Bonds, and Leases; and having likewise well cloathed him, (now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of his parchment suite) hee gave him <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton's Tenures</hi> in English to reade, with Doctor and Student, and such like, to initiate, and bring him to knowledge: to bee short, <hi>Meum</hi> grew not so experienced and cunning one way, but <hi>Tuum</hi> as crafty in another. Now this Attorney being a subtile Foxe, tooke the Parish part against the Proctor, in any sute that fell betweene the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and the Parish, concerning matter of Tith. <hi>Tuum,</hi> whither he had learned so much from his Maister, or some other had instructed him, comes to him that ought the Sow and Pigges, and tells him, hee had learn'd that the custome was in that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14709:7"/>
country, that if the Tith Pigge were not marked for the Parson, within eight daies after the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing (as it was not) the owner might lawfully sell off the Pigges, without paying Tyth at all: this sute, through the instigation of <hi>Meum</hi> on the one side, and <hi>Tuum</hi> on the other, began earnestly to be followed and defended: but an honest and a quiet minded Gentleman, who loved no strife among honest neighbours, laboured to make all parties friends; and it had beene then presently effected, but for <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> (who did vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently ever oppose each the other) Now in the meane time the old Parson dying, the sute ceased, and all became friends. Now to the late old Parsons living was presented a young man, a M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. of Arts of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who was as diligent in his place, as his predecessor was remisse; for he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched every Sabbath, and Catechized in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, reading prayers every Wednesday and Friday, observing the Canons duely in every thing; and which crowned his other good parts, hee was a great lover of Peace and Vnity among his neighbours, and could not endure any wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or brabling among his Parishioners: so that hearing what contention and strife had lately beene kindled in his Parish, through the meanes of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> of whom he had notice, and how that they lived in his Parish; he resolved by all meanes to rid the Towne of them. They on the other side, seeing now all things tending to peace and quietnesse, and little left to set them on worke (for as Eeles in mud, Beetles in dung, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14709:8"/>
Swine in the mire, they delighted in nothing but base brabbles, quarrels, and suits in law) and well knowing, they in that Country had gained ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience sufficient, <hi>pour passer par tout,</hi> and to set a a whole Country together by the eares, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved forthwith to travell towards <hi>London,</hi> and to goe by <hi>Cambridge:</hi> forward they goe, and the first night they take up their Lodging in an Inne, in that ancient Towne called of the <hi>Romans Sitomagum;</hi> here they stayed foure or five daies, one lying at the one end of the Towne, and the other at the other: but in this little space of their staie, they made worke a twelve Moneth after, for all the Lawiers within tenne miles of that place: for they set the Lords of two neighbouring Townes at odds; yea, two Swinheards of the same Townes, who beate one another fearefully, about their Swine trespassing one upon anothers Common: and another accident happened, whiles they were in that Towne. A certaine Bailife, did use to impound and take waifes and straies of all manner of Cattell, as fell within that Lordship; on a time, there were taken up as straies, two Milch Kine, and an Oxe: the Bailife to cheat the owner, (if at any time he came to enquire for Beasts) had this tricke; he would provide a great Rie loafe, taken hot out of the Oven, and put it upon the Beasts hornes, whereby he would bend them which way hee listed; if they grew narrow, hee would make them wider; if they declined backward, with his hot loafe, hee would bend them forward; so that when the owner came to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14709:8"/>
challenge his Cattell, he knew them not, for hee would say; surely the brand, and the eare-marke is mine; but my Cow, or Oxes hornes stood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way, this beasts hornes, hang in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, mine stood upright; but surely it is as like my Cow as ever I saw: so the honest man that owned them, durst not challenge them, but they fell as a cheate to the Lord, rather to the Bailiefe.</p>
            <p>This tricke being discovered to <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> by some who had practised the like; <hi>Meum</hi> growing acquainted with the owner, importun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to sue the Bailife: <hi>Tuum</hi> perswaded the Bailife to sue the owner, for giving out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning words against him, and laying claime to that, which hee could not justifie for his; but the Bailife being an old and a constant Guest to the Hostesse, where <hi>Meum</hi> lay, (who was a very handsome Lasse) She undertooke they should be all friends, and shake hands, and upon that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, She vowed to bestow a good peece of Beefe, a dish of Egges, and a Gallon of nappy Ale for a breakefast.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> got nothing hereby, for the world was now growne wise, and honest neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ended their strife and differences among themselves; so that although they had gotten skill sufficient in these parts, yet they had gained little for their maintenance and livelihood. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they resolved to visite the famous Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and to see if they could meete with any of <hi>Wrangle</hi> at <hi>Sturbridge</hi> Faire (for it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14709:9"/>
was now after <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-tide) and going on their way, they come to a Towne called <hi>QVI,</hi> where they went into an honest Alehouse to drinke (for the weather was yet warme,) here they found the Clerke of the Parish, a <hi>Suffolke</hi> Cheesemonger, and a Baker of <hi>Chesteron,</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly joviall and merry, for they had spent eleven Grotes in sheare Ale onely, beside Cheese and Bread, which the <hi>Suffolke</hi> man and the Baker had of their owne: a reckoning being called for; the Baker, who had long served that house with bread, denyed that it came to so much, for, quoth he, Hostesse, for every Pot that came in, I unbut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned a button; so that here are not so many, as you say we have had Pots; but the truth is, the Baker being halfe foxed, had not so many but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons at his Doublet, as Pots were broughtin; but the Hostesse would have her reckoning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> hearing this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Hostesse and Baker, began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise how they might interpose themselves, to come cleare off, for what they had called for in the house, and get somwhat more to beare charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. <hi>Meum,</hi> while the Baker stepped out of Dores, came and whispered him in the eare, and told him, that he was an Informer, lately come from <hi>Burie,</hi> and was going by <hi>Cambridge</hi> towards <hi>London,</hi> and that if hee would keepe his counsell, he would teach him how to bee even with her, for the smalenesse of her Pots, being under the allowance of the Statute, so that he might see
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14709:9"/>
them filled, and so take his oath safely; the Baker calls in for halfe a dozen more, and drinkes an Health to <hi>Meum: Meum</hi> againe to the Parish Clerke; he to the Cheesemonger; so the Baker well pleased, fetcheth from his basket two Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets, and gets Cheese of the <hi>Suffolke</hi>-man, and bids <hi>Meum</hi> fall to and welcome. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stesse, not suspecting any judgling or Treason against her at all, sits quietly, talking in the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin with <hi>Tuum;</hi> who having overheard those ill words the Baker gave her, and his misreckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; calls her on the one side, and tells her in private, that he was a Promotour, belonging to the Exchequer, and by his oath and office, hee could not chuse but informe against the smalnesse of his Bread, wanting in every penny Loafe two Ounces (for they borrowed Scales and sealed Weights, to weigh it, at a Chandlers in the Town) the Hostesse finding her selfe to have been cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for many yeares together; willingly consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bee revenged upon the Baker: <hi>Tuum</hi> takes the day and yeare in his Table Bookes, faithfully promising the Hostesse, forthwith to informe; and that for his part, hee would freely bestow his part of the Fine upon her, as pitying her losse, for so long a time: The Hostesse, with a low court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, thanks him heartily: hereupon <hi>Tuum</hi> called to pay; truly not a penny, if it were twise as much, quoth the Hostesse; with that she fetched forth a quarter of a rosted Pigge, and a dish of new ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Damsins, with a Mazer of good Ale, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14709:10"/>
shee powred a little cup of Anise-seede water, and dranke to <hi>Tuum,</hi> desiring him to know her house another time; he promised he would. So calling his Brother <hi>Meum</hi> from the Bakers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to set forward toward <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the Clerk of <hi>QVI</hi> desired <hi>Tuum</hi> to stay but a little, and knocking upon the Table with the Church-dore Key, called for a Cap of <hi>Cambridge</hi> beere, and dranke to <hi>Tuum,</hi> craving his name; hee told him; I am his Brother, quoth <hi>Meum;</hi> in good time, quoth the Clerke, came you not out of the Land of <hi>Pronounes?</hi> and have you no relation to our Towne of <hi>QVI?</hi> no, quoth <hi>Meum,</hi> your Towne should rather have relation to us, for every Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar Boy knowes, that <hi>QVI</hi> is a <hi>Pronoune Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and we are <hi>Possessives;</hi> in good time, quoth the <hi>Saffolke</hi> man, wee have too few of you in our Countrey, (when indeed they had too many) but the day being farre spent, <hi>Meum</hi> desired to bee going; but the Baker following him out of dores, spake something in secret unto him, and very likely gave him something to follow his sute; howsoever they all parted in a friendly manner, they going their severall wayes, and <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> for <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being come to <hi>Cambridge</hi> in very handsome and civill apparrell (for they had long since, sold their parchment sutes to a Tailor for Measures) like wise Travailers, the first thing they did, they enquired for, and tooke up their Lodging, which was (an Embleme of themselves) at he Two
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14709:10"/>
Wrestlers in the <hi>Petit-curie,</hi> where having taken up two severall Beds, they were quiet and merry, for that night; the next day they went abroad to view the Towne, and especially the ruines of the Castle, built by <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour, Pythagora's</hi> Schoole, and the Round Church, sometimes a Synagogue of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the Nunnery of Saint <hi>Radigunde,</hi> now converted into <hi>Iesus</hi> Colledge, and not farre beyond, that sometimes faire and well seated Abbey of <hi>Barnwell,</hi> built by Sir <hi>Paine Peverell,</hi> Standard-bearer to the Conquerour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning backe, they visited the Colledges; and one shewed them <hi>Erasmus</hi> his Chamber and Study, in Queenes Colledge, where he lay while he was in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as appeareth by many of his Epistles: but above all other, they desired to see the common Schooles, and desired to heare the Disputations, and wranglings of Sophisters; with some of whom after they had acquainted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they learned all the rules of Arguing, with the Nature of Syllogismes, and every Fallacie, whereby they enabled themselves, for reasoning <hi>pro &amp; con</hi> in all places, and upon every occasion; and were now became able to entangle any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, or Opposite in Logicall limetwigs. Now having well viewed the Vniversity and Towne, and being furnished with Latine and Logick, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the practise of the Law, they take their leaves, and to <hi>London</hi> forward by <hi>Trompington</hi> they goe: being gone some ten miles from <hi>Cambridge</hi> on their way; they espied many people at a Towns
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14709:11"/>
end, gathered in a cluster together, about a Peare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, that grew in the middest of an hedge, and amongst them the Clerk of the Parish. <hi>Meum</hi> wondring to see them there, could not devise what the occasion might be; quoth <hi>Tuum,</hi> surely there is a Swarme of Bees in the Tree: that time of the yeare is past, quoth <hi>Meum,</hi> it may be there is some Foxe-earth, Hedghog, or the like; nay, then why should the Clerke bee there? hee hath no skill in Foxe-hunting; it may bee, sometime he will follow the Hounds for his recreation: but the truth was, indeed that Peare-tree was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyersie betweene the owners of the Closes, on either side of the Hedge, and they in contention, who should have the Peares; the Vicar knowing not of whom to demand the Tyth of that Tree, attended there, till the controversie was ended; those people were ancient men and neighbours, who came to ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s they thought the right lay: <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> argued the case, as Lawyers, and concluded after a long dispute, that some lusty fellow in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany should goe up, and shake the Tree, and what Peares fell on either side the Hedge, should bee theirs who owed the grounds, and those that fell in the Hedge, should appertaine to neither of them, but all should goe to the Vicar, for his Tyth: they were all contented, and so carying <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> to their Alehouse, which was hard by the Church-stile, at an old Widdow-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, they gave them great thanks, with the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14709:11"/>
courtesie of their Towne, and to boote, their pockets full of Peares.</p>
            <p>Forward they goe, and at last get to <hi>London,</hi> a place they long longed to see, especially <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and the Courts there in Terme time: wherfore they resolved to lodge and place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereabout. <hi>Meum</hi> toke a Chamber in <hi>Theeving-lane: Tuum,</hi> a little darke roome, that had but one window, no bigger then a Cat might creepe through, hard by <hi>Hell,</hi> neare to the upper end of <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall: being provided of their lodging, the next day they had an humour (having yet nothing to doe,) to goe see a Beare-baiting, over the Water; but comming to <hi>Westminster</hi> Bridge, they found the Water-men pitifully fallen out, and railing one at another, and almost toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the eares, about their Fares; one crying out, Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> or Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> I am your first man, heere's your worship's Boate, I caried you to <hi>Brainford</hi> last Thursday: they seeing the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men so vexed, with haling and calling on every side, with such a thunder of severall tones, that were able to make a man more deafe then the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of <hi>Nilus; Tuum</hi> craves silence of them, and thus speakes to the Gentlemen in private; Gentlemen, quoth he, it is now Vacation, and the deadest time thereof, and I suppose you are going over the water, as we are, I will tell you, for a quart of Wine, and a pecke of Oisters on the other side, I will lay a Spell under this Bridge, where the Tyde shall not wash it away, that as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14709:12"/>
long as it is there, from hence forward, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen every Vacation shall be silent and of very few words, and during the Terme they shall have the gift of curing all that are thicke of hearing; the Gentlemen, being ingenuous and free, condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended; and I have heard, the same Charme or Spell lieth under <hi>Westminster</hi> Bridge yet.</p>
            <p>But now come over to the Beare-garden, and seeing the manifold contention and quarrels betweene the Beare-wards and the City Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for the first turnes, or courses with their Dogges, all having promiscuously paid their money, and were ready with their bats to knock one another downe; <hi>Meum</hi> began to give hard language to the Beareward, taking the Butchers part: a Bearward (as they are feirce and cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick) like their pupils, the Beares) strikes at <hi>Meum</hi> with a good Crab-tree cudgell; he to avoide the blow, fell backward, quite over a Beares backe; herewith the Beare fell a roring: <hi>Tuum</hi> (whose backe was turned) looking behinde him, and seeing <hi>Meum,</hi> as he thought, felled to the ground and slaine, and verily beleeving it was hee that rored, when he fell, ran, as if he had been frantick, out of dores; and as hee came hastily by where a Bull was baited hard by, (such was his hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that) to avoide the presse of the people, he came within the Buls reach, the Bull beeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come furious and mad, with many blowes, Dogs, slitting his eares, and the like, runnes full at <hi>Tuum,</hi> and with his horne taking hold of his Breeches,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14709:12"/>
tossed him up; but <hi>Tuum</hi> having but one poynt, that brake, and his Hose fell about his heeles; which made all the standers by forget the Bull, to laugh at, or pity him: away then goes <hi>Tuum</hi> to the water side, and taking a Boate, leaves <hi>Meum</hi> to follow at his leasure.</p>
            <p>The same night both meeting with either at <hi>Westminster,</hi> they related their hard fortune, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing never to come any more among Dogges and Beares: but the Terme being at hand, to keepe company with Lawyers, and their Clients onely.</p>
            <p>The Terme being come, they now thought it best to acquaint themselves with some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Attorneys, and Clerks of the Innes of Chancery, who might aswell set them in a way to practise, as to get them acquaintance: and first they enquired for <hi>Lions</hi> Inne (a Country Careier directed them to the Tower, where the <hi>Lions</hi> were) which when they had found, they grew acquainted with many Students, who were <hi>Cornish</hi> and <hi>Devonshire</hi> Gentlemen: who (when <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> had related unto them their names, whence they came, and those various accidents that had befell them, in their journey, ever since they came from <hi>Wrangle</hi>) made very much of them, imagining they had beene great Students, and very expert in the Lawes: but being examined and throughly tried by a very honest Attorney of that house (who wanted his sight) he found them to be nothing else, then incendiaries
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14709:13"/>
and make-bates in the Common wealth, and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to live in the country, and rather go make peace among their neighbours, then set them at variance; for we (quoth he) who are Attorneys, if men would be quiet and agree among themselves, would never intreate or sue for imployment from them; but when as sutes, by delay or neglect (as wounds) beginne to fester and gangrene, then indeed we ought (as Surgeons) to doe our best to make an easie and speedy cure; with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Adviso's, which they little regarded: but taking their leaves, went to some houses (I will not name) where they found good respect and entertainment. And finding some encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, to <hi>Westminster</hi> they goe, where looking about them, they admired the largenes &amp; stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Hall, and above, that the timber of the roofe, having been there so long, should be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cobwebs; perhaps, quoth <hi>Tuum,</hi> they are swept downe against the Terme; quoth <hi>Meum,</hi> thou art a foole, all <hi>Kentstreete</hi> cannot afford a beesome so long; a country man over hearing them, answered, the roofe was made of <hi>Irish</hi> timber, which no Spider durst touch; if there were any Cobwebs, they were beneath, about the Clarks and Notaries Seates, which are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never swept. When they had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently gazed about, and observed as much as they could, comming out with the Country man, they viewed well the great dore of the Hall; where they espied two Stags Couchand, with Crownes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14709:13"/>
about their necks, and chaines thwart their backs; they asked the reason of their being there: the Country man said, doubtlesse it was because so much Venison had beene eaten in that Hall, when the Kings of <hi>England</hi> held their great feasts there: <hi>Tuum</hi> thought rather they were some tame Deere, because of their chaines: but the truth is, the Hall of <hi>Westminster</hi> was built anew by K. <hi>Richard</hi> the second, and they were his Badges, for the Kings Mother, whom the blacke Prince married, was widdow to Lord <hi>Holland,</hi> Earle of <hi>Kent;</hi> and being one of the most beautifullest Ladies of <hi>England,</hi> and called the faire Mayd of <hi>Kent,</hi> before her marriage, She gave for her Devise (or Crest) the white Hind; which her Sonne the King, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a Stagge. But to returne to our new Termers, <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum;</hi> within a day or two, they ordered the matter so, that they gat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in all the Courts of <hi>Westminster;</hi> and in no long time, by observation and practise, they grew so expert, that they were still at one end of every Cause that was pleaded: not a Counsellor, nor Attorney belonging either to the Kings <hi>Bench, Commonpleas,</hi> or any other Court, but grew acquainted with them, and many times, in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, would salute them w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, Good morrow M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Meum,</hi> Save you Mr. <hi>Tuum,</hi> I pray let me see you at my Chamber, I have beene, (and so have we all) much beholding unto you, for your acquaintance and furtherance, wee many times fare the better for you: yet <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14709:14"/>
were like the Whetstone, that could sharpen every thing, yet it selfe was blunt, they could enrich others, yet were ever in want (for indeed men ever by sutes and contention begger themselves, as we see by daily experience,) howbeit they gat sufficient to maintaine them hand somly, and now and then to go to the Dogge Taverne at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> (who I remember, the last day of the Terme, bit <hi>Meum</hi> fearefully) to bid a friend to Supper, and the like: and whereas before they were called by their bare names only, they were called now Mr. <hi>Meum,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tuum.</hi> Now having beene throughly acquainted with <hi>Westminster,</hi> but <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> better with them, and some three or foure Termes past, and the long Vacation comming on; they heard there was a controversie between certaine Gentlemen, Projectors, and of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where they were borne, about the vast and spatious Fennes thereabout; whereupon imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there might bee good fishing in those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waters, they resolved to goe downe thither, to make a division among them, if they could not agree among themselves. So putting money con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient in their purse, away for their Country they go, playing many merry trickes by the way, which would fill three such bookes as this, if I should recount them in order. Now by the way, if they should happen to want money, <hi>Meum</hi> resolved to take upon him the name and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Physitian, and to cure all manner of diseases and griefes by stroking the part pained,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14709:14"/>
and uttering some few words, by way of charme (as you shall heare anon,) <hi>Tuum</hi> would, like a Gypsey, be a teller of Fortunes, especially to widdowes and young wenches; and indeed they got hereby much money, and grew famous. One thing I must not forget, by the way, as they went three or fourescore miles from <hi>London,</hi> as they walked downe a Lane, a great shower of raine fell, which constrained them to goe through a Gentlemans yard, who had beene a Iustice of the Peace, and was sitting in a wicker chaire, (and the Constable of that Parish, a little distance off, upon an Hogstrough) to see his Swine ringed: the Iustice was clad in cloth, spunne in his owne house, seldome came he up to <hi>London,</hi> but ever staid at home, keeping a good house among his neighbours: <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> passing by, saluted him with all due respect; my friends, quoth he, you are welcome, where is your dwelling? quoth <hi>Meum,</hi> An't please your worship, in <hi>Westminster,</hi> in a place called <hi>Theeving Lane,</hi> and my Brother about, or neare to <hi>Hell;</hi> by my honesty, quoth he; both bad and naughty places, I wonder my fellow Iustices thereabouts will take no order with that Lane, either to place honest men in it, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moove it further off, from his Majesties Court: I have heard that in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time, much Pla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

About twenty yeares agoe, when I sat at our Sessions, and was Eldest Iustice, a Tinker was brought us for steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Porredge Pot, and his inditementranne, for felloniously taking and carying away, upon such a Day, in such a Moneth, one brazen Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redge Pot, weighing forty nine pounds, with three eares, and two feete; now, as wee all know, a Porredge Pot hath onely two eares, and three feete: I was the first that found this same error in the inditement, whereupon the Iury brought in <hi>Ignoramus;</hi> whether was it not well done of mee or no? An't like your worship, quoth <hi>Tuum,</hi> they could doe no other. Againe, there was within some three or foure miles of me, an ancient farme house, the title where of was in controversie, and the Owner herein had placed foure or five lustie fellowes, his friends and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to keepe the possession; now in the Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion weeke last past, the Minister and the whole Parish were to goe their Procession; their way (which was the division of two Parishes) was through the Hall and the Kitchin, and through the middest of the Orchard, by the end of a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14709:16"/>
Swine-coate; they who kept possession, denied entrance to the Procession, and barred up the Gates against the Minister and the whole Parish: they seeing this, sent for a Smith, and brake up the dores, and moreover pulled down a wall, that stopped their way. I now demaund, Mr. <hi>Meum,</hi> whether the Owner (who indeed was my neere Kinseman) might sue the Parson and his Parish for a Riot or not? quoth <hi>Tuum</hi> by no meanes, a Procession must have a way made to their hands, or make it themselves; beside, the publike cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of a Parish, must bee preferred, before a private Title in question, provided no Parke bee prejudiced thereby; yet if my Brother and I, quoth <hi>Tuum,</hi> had beene entertained in that, or the like case, wee would have held the Parish to it for one seven yeares: God forbid, quoth the good Gentleman, there were no Conscience or Charity in that; yet when both of you are sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out, and at odds, one with another, you little thinke of Conscience or Charity, nay, upon my knowledge your selves, or get others to doe so much for you. With that hee called to have the old Sow well ringed, for rooting up her Mistrisses Parsneps; and sends Cicelie his Mayd, for a Flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon of good beere, of that Hogges-head which stood under the Staires; which being done, hee heartily dranke unto them, desiring that if they at any time passed by his house, they would visit him, and if hee had any occasion to use them (which he thought he should never have, growne
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14709:16"/>
in yeares, and loving peace, and his rest, hee would imploy them: they thanking him kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, take their leaves and departed.</p>
            <p>Being on their way, they heard of a great Faire, which was at a Market Towne about eight miles of; thither they resolved to goe, to trie what acquaintance they could meete withall, or what purchase they could come by: comming to the Towne, they heard of one Master <hi>Lime,</hi> a rich Attorney, who was much troubled with the gout. Meum imagined there might some good bee done with him, in regard as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well that he was a Lawyer, as diseased, because it was vacation, and he intended to practise Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke; <hi>Tuum</hi> staying at an Ale-house in the Faire, <hi>Meum</hi> enquires after Master <hi>Limes,</hi> (who by this name should seeme to be a <hi>Dorset shire</hi> man) this Master was, it is true, of late yeares an Attorney, but growne rich, old, and unfit for Travell, had given over his Practise, and now only betooke himselfe to a private life, (being exceeding rich in mony and lands) and only now endeavour to make peace among his neighbours, if any sutes or dissension arose among them, which indeed he truly performed; for if any two rich landed men were at strife, about some peece of ground, cottage, and the like, one of these, sometime both, would come to him for his counsell; him, in whom he knew the right to remaine, he would tell; it would prove a chargeable and a tedious sute, and likelie to bee brought into the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14709:17"/>
the quantity was not great, it held in Knights service, and might bring the rest of his land into bondage; he would advise him to take money, and sell his right: then sending for his adversary, he tells him his title was not worth a rush, the Law was plaine against him, and wished him (as hee did the other) to take a peece of money for agreement, and so order the matter (if it were land that lay for his turne,) as next his owne, or neere his house) he would hooke it in to himselfe, at no greate rate: then with a quart or two of wine, at the next Taverne, make them both friends, and very kindly to shake hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Againe, if some young Heire, newly come to his lands, had formerly runne into the lash foure or five hundred pounds thicke, and his Creditors taking the opportunity of his fortunes, would beare with him no longer, but lay out to arrest, and every way to vexe him; old <hi>Lime</hi> underhand would furnish the young Gentleman with money, to satisfie them all; but before take a Morgage of all his land, happily might bee worth an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or sixscore pounds, <hi>per Annum;</hi> which hee being unable to redeeme, at the appointed day, taking up a second summe, sells it all unto him out right, then calls his Creditors together, and maketh him and them friends, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the debt himselfe, hee there tenders them downe the one halfe of their money, the rest he paies by parcell and petty sums at his leasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:14709:17"/>Sometimes hee is trusted with money ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the Country for charitable uses, as Building, or repairing of Bridges (in regard of the great credit hee hath in the Country, and his acquaintance with the better sort) reparation of Sea-banks, High wayes, and the like, but he keepes it close, till extremity, and the feare of a Pursevant wrings it out of his fist.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> not knowing any way in the world to come by money, in case Master <hi>Lime</hi> should be from home, and the humour take him to lend them none, considering he had beene so much beholding unto them, or their kindred: <hi>Meum,</hi> as I said, began to practise in the Towne, taking upon him to cure all Aches, Tumours, Wounds, Dislocations, Distemperatures, and in generall all manner of Diseases by stroking with the hand, and uttering certaine words by way of a charme: <hi>Tuum</hi> tooke upon him to bee his man, and was to make good whatsoever hee spake of himselfe, and his depth of skill in that manner of cure. Beside, <hi>Meum</hi> had in a readinesse a Catalogue, and a counterfeit Testimoniall of Lords, Ladyes, Gentlewomen, and Merchants Wives, Mayds, and of all sorts, whom hee had cured after that way, some of Dropsies, the Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, Agues, and the like: <hi>Tuum</hi> was to affirme, he was the seventh son of a seventh son: but this one thing troubled <hi>Meum</hi> much, that was, if any patient should demand of him the name and quality of his disease, and what were the Symptomes of the same, hee could not tell; wherefore he held it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14709:18"/>
the best course of professing, to cure all at once; neither durst hee goe any Empyricall way to worke, in giving this or that to his Patient, for he had no more skill in a Drug then my Dog, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more what to give, then they knew what to take, and stroking was a thing of neither la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or cost, which a little Loveret; or the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Asse in <hi>England</hi> might doe: yet to let the world know hee was not ignorant in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Simples, by the way, he would dig up some rootes with his knife, no matter what, which cut in peeces and cleane scrap'd, he would put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his handkercher: these dried by the fire, and beaten to powder, he would give alike to all, yea those that were most dangerously sicke, either in Posset-ale, or the pap of an Aple, and if any such recovered by the strength and benefit of Nature (as some doe) then (as he would often say) his fame would fly farre, and his name bee made knowne to all the Countrie. The rootes he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried commonly about him were called <hi>Morsus Diaboli</hi> the devils bit which groweth in Corne fields, and Meadowes, the <hi>Fenne</hi> Parsnep, which is sweet and hath the taste of our common Pars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nep, but present poyson, (as one <hi>Hamon Rainard</hi> in the <hi>Fenne</hi> prooved, for bringing home many, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to bee boyled and buttered, but in the space of the burning of a Candle, his Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and himselfe died) sometime hee would venture upon <hi>Sol<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

going downe the staires, <hi>Twig</hi> followed him at heeles, and whispers him closelie in the eare, that hee had a friend hard by, which was an handsome one (indeed a Tanners daughter, who was his sweet-heart) who was troubled with a great swelling, and if he could doe her any good, hee should have content to his desire: but that cure passed <hi>Meum's</hi> skill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tuum</hi> was not idle all this while at his Hostes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for by her meanes he had gotten many Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who came to him for goods lost and stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, as Hogges straied away, Turkies stollen; a Maid came to <hi>Tuum</hi> for a silver Spoone, stolne out of the Noursery; another made pitifull moane to <hi>Tuum</hi> for the losse of his wife, who was runne away with a Miller, besides some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he got, for telling Maides and Widdowes their fortunes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meum</hi> to endeare himselfe the more (for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the mother of admiration) kept himselfe close in his Chamber; and if any had occasion to use him, they mustrepaire unto him at night, or earlie in the morning; at what time there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted unto him people of all sorts, Ladies, Gentlewomen, and other honest Women, for sore Breasts, swellings in the Throate, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in the mouth, the Toothach, and all griefes else whatsoever. <hi>Meum</hi> seeing his Patients come so thicke, grew into an humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pride, that hee would stroke but whom hee listed, and when hee listed; but howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14709:21"/>
in few dayes they had gotten nine or tenne pounds; so that they thought it was now high time to bee going, remembring well that, <hi>Ficta persona non diu geritur;</hi> overnight mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even with their Hostesse, away they went the next morning.</p>
            <p>But this one thing fell out most strangelie, that as many as <hi>Meum</hi> had stroked, both men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children, very presently after fell cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly out one with another: Master <hi>Lime</hi> sued the Parson of the Towne; Women of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort, the next Holy-day fell out flat in the Church, for place and precedency, who, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, should sit uppermost in the same seat: which quarrell the Minister of the place would moderate and settle with good words, in this, or the like manner.</p>
            <p>I thinke honest neighbours and friends, there ought in the Church, (saving for decency in the placing of Magistrates, and chiefe Governours) to be no difference: and this ambition for place and superiority in the Church, cannot be but foolish, if not impious; when time, in not many yeares, will make no difference in lodging you, even in those Alleyes you sit in, and tread upon; therefore I have heard it is a custome in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlandr,</hi> for Burgers wives and their daughters every one to carie their Leather little chaires to Church with them, there taking their places as they fall: Another, wife to a Rope-maker at a Churching would eate no meate, because a

Ioyners wife sate above her: but do what they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> had got themselves away, and were farre enough.</p>
            <p>Being come at last downe into their native Countrie among the Fennes, which seemed to bee in Controversie, betweene the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors and the Country, they found all things appeased and quiet, all parties were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and nothing remained for <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> to worke upon; whereupon they resolved to goe farther Northward: but even at this time, they hearing of old <hi>Harpax</hi> their Father's death, backe they returned to <hi>Wrangle,</hi> where I heare they are now in sute, at strife, for his land and goods; <hi>Meum</hi> affirming himselfe to be the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, <hi>Tuum</hi> saith hee is as old as he, for they bee twinnes: which is like to prevaile wee shall know at this next Terme, when they returne up to <hi>London.</hi> In the meane time I leave them wrangling, at their Native Towne of <hi>Wrangle,</hi> where I first found them.</p>
