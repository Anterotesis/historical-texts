            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MR. <hi>Beal</hi> the Meſſenger being ſent Expreſs by the way of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General <hi>Kirk,</hi> returned yeſterday morning about eight of the Clock, having left Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> on <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt, being the thirtieth Day of <hi>July,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Inch</hi> in <hi>Lough Swille:</hi> He brings Advice, That Major-General <hi>Kirk,</hi> with the Ships and men under his Command, having continued a conſiderable time in <hi>Lough Foyl,</hi> and ſeing that it was impoſſible to Relieve the Town by that way, till ſuch time as he ſhould be Re-inforced with Forces from <hi>England,</hi> he thought it neceſſary and Requiſite to Sail to <hi>Lough Swille,</hi> to joyn Colonel <hi>Stuart,</hi> who is Poſted in the Iſle of <hi>Inch:</hi> And accordingly he did ſet Sail, in order to perform that Voyage; upon which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> drew all their Forces from <hi>Lough Foyl,</hi> in order to oppoſe their Deſigns: And withal, to prevent the People of <hi>Inniskilling</hi> and <hi>Ballyſhannon,</hi> &amp;c. from joining them, leaving only an inconſiderable Party, with two Pieces of Cannon, to Guard the Bomb, having carried the reſt of the Guns with them. Upon notice of their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> ſailed back to <hi>Lough Foyl,</hi> where he ſoon put the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to flight, &amp; broke the Bomb with little or no oppoſition, having loſt but one Man in the Action. Then he Sailed to <hi>London-Derry,</hi> where he was joyfully receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Inhabitants, who began to want Proviſions, being reduced to that ſcarcity, that they were obliged for ſome days together to eat Horſe-fleſh, and were allowed but one Bisket a piece every day. The Inhabitants of the Town ſent on Board the Fleet to acquaint Major General <hi>Kirk,</hi> that they wanted no Men in the Town, nor Ammunition, but Proviſion; and in regard they had been ſo long Commanded by the Reverend Colonel <hi>Walker,</hi> and had been ſo ſucceſsful by the Bleſſing of God in their ſeveral Sallies, they humbly deſired him not to Land his Men there, but to Sail and joyn Colonel <hi>Stuart</hi>; telling him withal it might occaſion Grumbling in the Town, if ſo be the Inhabitants ſhould be commanded by ſtrange Officers. They likewiſe deſired to land what Proviſions he had for them, which he accordingly did; and afterwards accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deſire, Sailed to the Iſle of <hi>Inch,</hi> where he is now Arrived, and has a Body of Six thouſand brave Men, and hath a free Correſpondence with the People of <hi>Inniskilling</hi> and <hi>Ballyſhannon,</hi> who have lately marched out of that Iſland, and fought the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> in the Field, with that reſolution and bravery, ſtanding the Brunt of the Battel, till all the Shot on both ſides were ſpent, and then they went to work with the But-end of their Muſquets. At length they beat the Enemy out of the Field, killing ſome hundreds upon the Spot, and taking ſeveral Priſoners, with Two Hundred Scarlet Cloaks, the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> himſelf narrowly eſcaping. 'Tis generally believed, that they have joyned thoſe of the Iſle of <hi>Inch</hi> ere this; if Major General <hi>Kirk</hi> had but Arms, they would be able to make a Body of Thirty Thouſand Men, which would, in all probability, ſoon deſtroy the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, they being ſo often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready defeated, and the Proteſtants fluſht with Victory.</p>
