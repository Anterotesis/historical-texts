         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(beeing choſen Generall of the
Chriſtian Army, for the freedome
and deliuerance of Ieruſalem from
<hi>Saladine,</hi> and al his other heathen miſcreants;) Euery
Chriſtian Kingdome did ayde him with their beſt
aſſiſtance: becauſe it was a buſineſſe to Gods high
honour, and generall comfort of poore diſtreſſed
Chriſtians. As from all other Kingdomes, ſo from
England (among other bands of worthy men) went
the Merchants (trading in fiſh, oyle, flaxe, ſilkes and
other commodities) moſt frequently then termed
<hi>Fiſhmongers,</hi> and the <hi>Goldſmithes,</hi> then in a late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
league of loue and amity, by many friendly
helpes and furtherances each to other, in diuers
dangerous aduentures, as well on the Seas, as the
land, no men being more forward in thoſe affaires,
and in thoſe times then they.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13303:4"/>
After the moſt glorious victory obtained againſt
the Pagans, &amp; Ieruſalem regained, they ioined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in as glorious an action, of helping to build the
ruined Wall againe, from the Water-gate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
to the Sheepe-gate of innocencie, or holineſſe.
And ſo much the rather, becauſe there was then
much neceſsity of their paines and endeuour, not
only (by Fiſhing and Shipping) to ſupply the daily
wants of the Souldiours: but alſo for bringing Gold
and Siluer thither, for beautifying Gods City and
Temple.</p>
            <p>And as this league of loue and fellowſhip began
vpon ſo good an occaſion: So they continued, and
declared it in Englands Ieruſalem, our famous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis
<hi>London,</hi> building the Wall and two North
Gates therein, <hi>Moore-gate,</hi> and <hi>Cripleſ-gate,</hi> as yet
their Armes and Memories on them do ſufficiently

            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, Fiſh and Oyle, as well as Golde, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

                  <hi>TIme</hi> hauing turned his yearely Glaſſe, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of a Magiſtrate, a Brother of the <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mougers</hi>
Societie, comming (by right of
place, and general Sufferages of the Citizens) to the
high dignitie of Lord Maior of this Citie for the
yeere enſuing: our deuices for that ſolemne and Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiall
day, were and are accordingly proportioned,
by the diſcreete and well aduiſed iudgement of the
Gentlemen, thereto choſen and deputed, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and forme as followeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, becauſe <hi>Fiſhing</hi> is the abſolute
Embleme of our preſent intendement, and <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,</hi>
hauing beene ſuch worthy Merchants in
thoſe reuerend and authentique times: leauing
their matter of Commerce and Merchandiſe, and
ayming at their true Hierogliphical impreſſe for the
dayes intended honour, thus we marſhall the order
of proceeding.</p>
               <p>Our firſt deuice that vſhers and leades the way,
is a very goodly and beautifull fiſhing Buſſe, called;
the <hi>Fiſhmongers Eſperanza,</hi> or Hope of <hi>London:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in her true old ſhape, forme and proportion, yet
<pb facs="tcp:13303:5"/>
diſpenſed withall in ſome beautie, for the dayes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
It may paſſe (by generall ſufferance) for the
ſame fiſhing Buſſe, wherein S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſate mending
his Nets, when his beſt Maſter called him from
that humble and lowly condition, and made him a
Fiſher of men. If not ſo; take her for one of thoſe fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Buſſes, which not only enricheth our kingdome
with all variety of fiſh the Sea can yeelde: but hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
alſo (in that kind) all other lands. Fiſhermen,
in this fiſhing Buſſe are ſeriouſly at labour, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp their Nets, laden with liuing fiſh, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them bountifully among the people.</p>
               <p>Next followeth a crowned <hi>Dolphin,</hi> alluding ſom
way to the Lord Maiors coate of Armes, but more
properly to the Companies, and therefore may
ſerue indifferently for both. But becauſe it is a Fiſh
inclined much (by nature) to Muſique: <hi>Arion,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Muſicion and Poet, rideth on his backe, being
ſaued ſo from death, when Robbers and Pirates on
the Seas, would maliciouſly haue drowned him.</p>
               <p>Then commeth the King of Moores, gallantly
mounted on a golden Leopard, he hurling gold and
ſiluer euery way about him. Before, on either ſide,
and behinde him, ride fixe other his tributarie
Kings on horſe-backe, gorgeouſly attired in faire
guilt Armours, and apt furniutre thereto belonging.
They carry Ingots of golde and ſiluer, and each one
his dart, and in this order they attend on him: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby, that the Fiſhmongers are not vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of their combined brethren, the worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Golde-Smithes, in this ſolemne day of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13303:5"/>
We next preſent a ſingular Embleme, correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with the Creaſt and Cognizance of the Lord
Maior, and bearing an eſpeciall Morality beſide.
A <hi>Leman tree,</hi> in full and ample forme, richly laden
with the fruite and flowers it beareth. Neere to the
ſtocke or roote thereof, a goodly <hi>Pellicane</hi> hath
built her neſt, with all her tender brood about her.
And becauſe her loue and care (according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of <hi>Ariſtotle, Plinie, Geſner,</hi> and diuers other
good writers) makes her extraordinarily iealous of
them, as neuer daring to be abſent from them (the
ſuſtenance ſhe receiueth from the male Bird, being
inſufficient for their nouriſhing:) with her beake ſhe
launceth her breſt, and ſo ſupplieth that want with
her owne bloud. Our cited Authors variouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that this loue and cheriſhing of them laſteth
the ſpace of a whole yeare, by which time, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſtrong, and able for flight; and then, though
they ſuruiue, the Damme dyeth. An excellent type
of gouernment in a Magiſtrate, who, at his meere
entrance into his yeares Office, becommeth a nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
father of the Family: which, though hee bred
not, yet, by his beſt endeuour, hee muſt labour to
bring vp.</p>
               <p>If his loue and delight be ſuch to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
as that of the <hi>Pellican</hi> to her young ones, by
broken ſleeps, daily and nightly cares, that the very
leſt harm ſhould not happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his charge: then doth
he iuſtly anſwere to our Embleme; and, as of her,
ſo of him, it may well be ſayd, his breſt and bowels
of true zeale and affection, are alwaies open, to feed
and cheriſh them (euen with his beſt endeuor and
<pb facs="tcp:13303:6"/>
diligence) to the expiration of his yeare. And
then, though the maine Authoritie of Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(in him) may be ſayd to dye: yet it ſuruiueth in
other <hi>Pellicans</hi> of the ſame brood, and ſo it reacheth
to them in the ſame manner. And becauſe the
<hi>Leman Tree</hi> (by the affirmation of <hi>Iulius Solinus
Polyhiſtor, Dioſcorides, Pomponius Mela, Petrus
Mexius</hi> and <hi>Antonius Verdierus)</hi> both in fruite,
flowers, rinde, pith, and iuyce, are admirable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruers
of the ſences in man, reſtoring, comforting
and relieuing any the leaſt decay in them: wee ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the fiue Sences about the Tree, in their beſt and
liuelieſt repreſentations, as fitly iumping with our
Morall methode.</p>
               <p>Our next deuice, before it be marſhalled in due
ranke and order, is a goodly Bower, ſhaped in
forme of a flowrie Arbour, and adorned with all
the Scutchions of Armes of ſo many worthy men,
as haue beene Lord Maiors of the Fiſhmongers
Company, and each mans name truely ſet downe
on them. It is appointed firſt to ſtand in Paules
Church-yard: And at ſuch a place as is thoght moſt
conuenient. In this Bower is a faire Tombe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Suppoſe his Marble Statue (after the manner of
Knightly buriall) to lye vpon the Tombe, and both
it and the Bower to be worthily attended, by thoſe
fiue Knights in Armour, and mounted on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
that were Knighted with Sir <hi>William</hi> in the
field, after he had ſlaine the proud inſulting Rebell,
Captaine and ring-leader to all the reſt. Sixe
Trumpetters well mounted and appointed, with
Trumpet banners of the Companies Armes, and a
gallant guard of Halberdiers, being 24. in number,
with watchet ſilke Coats, hauing the Fiſhmongers
Armes on the breſt, Sir <hi>William Walworths</hi> on the
backe, and the Citties on the left arme, white Hats
and Feathers, and goodly Halbards in their hands:
theſe likewiſe haue their rancke and place neere to
the <hi>Tombe</hi> and <hi>Bower. Londons Genius,</hi> a comely
Youth, attired in the ſhape of an Angell, with a
golden Crowne on his head, golden Wings at his
backe, bearing a golden Wand in his hand, ſits
mounted on Horſebacke by the Bower; with an
Officer at Armes, bearing the Rebels head on <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths</hi>
Dagger. So ſoone as the Lord Maior is
come neere, and way made for his better attention:
the <hi>Genius</hi> ſpeaketh, the Trumpets ſound their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Surden flouriſhes, <hi>Walworth</hi> ariſeth, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaid
on Horſebacke from the Bower, as you may
better perceiue by the ſpeeches apted for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
The Bower and Tombe are likewiſe borne
along before him, for his more conuenient returne
to reſt againe.</p>
               <p>Wee come now to our laſt inuention in this our
Triumphall Progreſſe, memorizing <hi>Londons</hi> great
<pb facs="tcp:13303:7"/>
day of deliuerance, and the Fiſhmongers Fame for
euer, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1381. and on <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> day
in Weſt <hi>Smithfield,</hi> where the like number of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
(as then) were neuer aſſembled. Leauing the
matter, a caſe of deſperate Rebellion; the manner,
a moſt baſe and barbarous kinde of proceeding, to
the great diſturbance of the King and State, and
vnauoydable ruine of this Cittie, but for the good
<hi>Angell</hi> of defence then guarding it, and the worthy
Lord Maior made the ſecond inſtrument: let vs i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
(though not in the magnificent forme as
then it was done, yet according to our compaſſe of
performance) that whatſoeuer hath formerly been
ſayd concerning <hi>Walworths</hi> reuiuing at the Tombe,
his Royall attending, and the beautifull Monument
following, is all but a ſhaddow of that triumphant
victorie in our apteſt alluſion.</p>
               <p>Our Pageant Chariot, is drawne by two Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
&amp; two Mare-mayds, as being the ſupporters to
the Companies coate of Armes. In the higheſt
ſeate of eminence, ſits the triumphing Angell, who
that day ſmote the enemy by <hi>Walworths</hi> hand, and
laid all his proud preſuming in the duſt. With one
hand (King <hi>Richard</hi> ſitting in a degree beneath
her) ſhe holds his Crowne on faſt, that neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
Hoſtilitie, nor home-bred Trecherie ſhould
euer more ſhake it. In the other hand hee holds
his ſtriking Rodde, inferring thus much thereby:
<hi>By mee Kings reigne, and their enemies are ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
All the forefront is beautified with Royall Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
as Truth, Vertue, Honor, Temperance, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
Zeale, Equity, Conſcience, beating downe
<pb facs="tcp:13303:7"/>
Treaſon and Mutinie. Behind, and on the ſides,
ſits Iuſtice, Authority, Lawe, Vigilancy, Peace,
Plentie and Diſcipline, as beſt props and pillers to
any Kingly eſtate. Theſe, as all the reſt, are beſt
obſerued by their ſeuerall Emblems and properties,
borne by each one, and their adornments anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them in like manner.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus briefly deſcribed the order of the
daies ſeruice, inſomuch as appertaineth to my
charge and place, (not omitting the Fiſhing-Buſſe,
