            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

sacramente of the Lordes body and bloude maye bee reduced to the right vse accordyng to the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion therof in the primatiue Churche. And forasmuch as the whole processe of this discourse is bothe conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt vnto the worde of God that it cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, but that it is true, and also so iustely agreynge with the kinges Maiestees moste godly procedinges that the people maye by readyng or hearyng herof be throughly satisfied and perswaded vniuersally to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and folow the other. I thinke it (as I haue said) a weorke right expedient and necessary to be hadde in the Englishe toungue aswell for the instruction of suche as can reade, as also for the helpe of some good persones &amp; curates, whiche though they haue a good zele &amp; forwardnes to set forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges maiesties most christian procedynges: yet for defaulte of sufficiente learnyng (the more is the pietee) are not of themselues hable neither throughly to enstructe their flocke of all the trueth, nor to satisfy the ignoraunt in suche doubt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full cases or questions, as maye haplye aryse aboute this matier, nor finally to stoppe the mouthes of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Papistes, or of suche as are malicious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate enemies againste the pure doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes ghospell. And althoughe in treactynge of suche hygh matiers it can not bee auoided but that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of some schoole termes or argumentes there must nedes bee many thynges, that maye seme to passe the capacitee and vnderstanding of the vnlettred sorte: yet is not suche a notable good weorke as this discourse of Petur Martyr or as his disputacions vpon the same matier therfore to bee suppressed or kepte (as it

For yf no booke should bee sette foorth but suche as euery bodye yea euen of the vnlearned and grosse multitude mighte bee hable to vnderstande whan they heare it or reade it: than what should Chauncer, Goore, Lidgate and others doe abrode, whom some euen of the learned sorte doe in some places scarcely take? than were it vayne to set foorthe Chronicles or statutes in whiche is bothe a great noumbre of wordes, and also muche matier not easie to be perceyued of euery body: than wer it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure loste to sette foorthe in Englyshe bookes of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and homelies vnto the grosse and rusticall multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, whose capacite is not hable to conceiue that is in them conteined than wer it vayn to haue translated and sette foorth the bible in Englyshe to the vulgare people, and moste vain to reade it in the Churches, forasmuche as a greate noumbre of thynges whiche the symple ignoraunt people rede and heare thereout, are ferre aboue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fyrst &amp; formost. The holy scripture doth enforce it.

               </gap>she not onely for the lyfe of the worlde, but also to be eaten: and added these wordes thereto:
<q>Except a manne eate my fleashe and drinke, my bloud, he shal not haue life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He moreouer affirmed hymselfe to bee the bread from heauen, yea and the liuely breade, whiche the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hadde geuen, in which place he promised in playn wordes that he wolde geue hymselfe to be eat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n after the lykenesse of bread: and the thyng that he promised he did truely and vprightly perfourme, as the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes do beare witnesse that it was done at his last supper. And that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing which is geuen to eate, is the lordes body, Paule doeth playnly shew wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saieth:
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19768:9"/>Whoso eateth and drinketh it vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilye, shall be guiltie of the bodye and bloude of the Lorde. And agayne: He eateth and drinketh iudgemente agaynste him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in that he maketh not a difference of the Lordes bodye.</q>
But all the strength and pith of this argumente they auouche to consist in these wordes, in which it is sayd: This is my body: which wordes they wil i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any wyse to be cleare &amp; to haue no nede of any ferther expo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sicion or declaracion. And to vs (say they) for the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we oughe to the word of God, it is behouable to beleue the wordes. For the Euangeliste Mathew Marke, and Luke doe with a full consent agree vpon those wordes, yea and the Apostle Paule also in his former Epistle to the Corinthians. And onlesse it were a mattier of great weyght and importaunce, and so to be taken as it souneth without any ferther or other circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>staunce, the Apostles wold neuer with so greate concorde haue agreed among themselues. That if it were a thing lawful with tropes, that is to say, with figurate maners of speakynges to defeact or auoyde it: than shal nothyng (saye they) be safe ne sure for the Heretiques but that they wyl corrupte it with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaicte exposicions.</p>

            <p>Thirdly suche thynges as by nature and kynde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="iii"/> are distincte thynges, and (as the Logicians in theyr terme call it) <hi>disparata,</hi> that is to saye, so disseuered, that their natures disagree, and haue some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie one to the other, as (for example) a manne, a horse, and a stone: al suche thynges (I say) are of suche rate y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it cannot by any meanes be truely sayd, that the one is the other. For it cannot in any manner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng be truely sayed that a man is a stone, or a stone is a man. And that breade and Christes body are of this rate, that is to saye, are thynges of two distincte and contrarie natures, no man nedeth to doubte. Wherfore it shall neuer be true to saye of breade, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="iiii."/> it is Chistes body. And therefore whan the lorde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced these wordes, This is my body, it must of necessitie be, that the substaunce of bread was gone.</p>
            <p>Another reason also that is made, is this: In saying This is my body, Christ did not without a due co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideracion vse this word, is, whiche is in gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer a

For Austen had no respecte hereunto, but his mynde was to declare, that it was a figurate speache, and lyke to the other which he allegethe out of the Deuterenomi. Bloud is the soule or life. The Lorde (sayeth he) therfore dyd not doubte, because we are some what bolde in vsyng some tropes, that is to saye, such maniers of speakyng as sometimes the scripture doth vse. In the thyrde booke <hi>de doctrina Christiana,</hi> that is to saye, of christian doctrine, and the sixth chapitur, he doeth teache vs that this saying in the sixthe of Iohn is figurate, Except ye eate the fleashe of the sonne of man. &amp;c.

And he expresseth by name that the sacramente of the body of Christe is the bodye of Christe after a sorte: and he sayeth a litell after, that the Sacramente of the bloud of Christe, is the bloude of Christe. And al this dyd Austen write that he might proue baptisme to be the sacrament of feith, and that therefore it maye bee sayed, that it is feith: &amp; that childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baptised haue feith because thei receiue that a sacrament.</p>

breade, where as Christe spake of theyr doctrine. He sayed also. Lazarus our frende slepethe. Here dyd the Apostles slepe also, and sayde. If he slepe, he shall do well inoughe, &amp; recouer agayne. where as Christe spake of hys death. The Lorde sayeth in an other place. Destroye you thys temple, and in three dayes I shall builde it vp agayne. neyther dyd the Apostles vnderstande that he spake of hys bodye. He that kepeth my commaundementes shall not dye for euer. And here also dyd the Iewes thynke that he spake of the bodilye deathe. Necodemus dyd grosselye vnderstande the newe generation &amp; byrthe that Christe spake of. Neither was the Samaritane woman anye thing lesse deceyued aboute that matter whyche Christ promised hyr.</p>
            <p>The Hebrues also were deceyued whan Christe sayde vnto them. Abraham did se my dayes, and did reioyce. Let theim not therefore saye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore vnto vs, thys scripture is plaine, This is my body, for we answere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is plaine as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:19768:49"/>
Wherefore there is no cause, why the plainnes of the wordes shoulde so muche be alleged. We muste of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of scripture, and of the circumstaunces wel consider what is in thys mattier mente aud intended.</p>
            <p>We wyl therfore expoune this proposition, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what depelye repetynge the matter from the bottome God was wyllynge to drawe man vnto hym wyth large and greate promises: as, that he woulde make him happye and blessed.</p>
            <p>And bycause he knewe oure beleuynge herte, he woulde that there shoulde be manye benifites of hys she<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wynge towardes mankind, remayne and appeare in memorie, whereby he might allure and drawe man vnto hym. Wherefore he dyd not onelye giue all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vnto man, but also in the tyme of the floude, he deliuered our kinde (whiche hadde full euyll deserued it) from the destruction of the water.</p>
            <p>To Abraham he declared hym selfe very fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and louinge. To Isaac also, &amp; to Iacob his sonnes sonne. He prospered their stocke whan they were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, he deliuered them, and gaue them a fruitefull contrye to dwell in, and promoted them to the dignitie of kynges and priestes, and yet were they continually men of a harde beliefe, and did not perfectelye thincke that God owed them good wyll. Wherefore for their infidelitie, he cast them oute into diuers captiuities, &amp; agayne manye sondrye tymes he deliuered them.</p>
            <p>In conclusion to the entente that there shoulde be no place lefte of doubtinge of hys goodnesse, he gaue them the greateste and highest benefite of al benefites that is to wete, hys sonne takynge on him our fleshe, that he shoulde dye on the crosse for oure healthe &amp; sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,

the whiche benefite was suche and so greate, that Paule to the Romaynes, sayeth: howe hath he not geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs al thinges with his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne: And than lefte thesame so greate and so hyghe a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, should any more bee forgotten, his wil and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was, that it should euermore nowe and than bee renewed in this sacrament of thankes geuyng, to then tente that we should continually by faith thinke in our myndes that Christ was geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his father to death and that by the beleuyng thereof, we shoulde eate his fleashe and drincke his bloud, whiche thing to thente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that it might the more effectually bee dooen, the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of bread and wyne were ioygned vnto it, whiche should more earnestly moue vs then bare woordes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone had been wont to dooe. Therfore whan he saith, This is my body, he vnderstoode none other thing, than he promised in the sixthe of Iohn whan he sayed: I am the bread of life, he spake of himself as concernyng his body and fleashe deliuered to death, or rather that should afterward be deliuered as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appereth by his woordes Neither ment he, eny o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thyng, but that these thinges shoulde be vnto vs breade and meate, wherwith our solles might be com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forted and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, and by the mynde or solle the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy also should be confyrmed, and so consequentlye all the whole man. Christ therfore at his last supper me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nor went about nothyng els, but turned and sette the woordes of his former saying: one in anothers place: and lyke as afore he had sayde his bodye and fleashe to be bread, so now placyng the wordes in the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordre, and shewyng forth the bread, he saieth that
<pb facs="tcp:19768:50"/>
the bread is his body. And whyle he pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced these woordes. This is my body, it was eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much as if he should haue sayed: My body receiued by feith shall be vnto you in stede of breade, and shall bee lyke as it wer bread, wherewith ye maie be spiritually fed and nourished. Leat therfore the sence and plaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be this: I geue you breade to eate, and in the meane tyme I propoune and set foorthe vnto you my body which shall bee nailed vpon the crosse, that ye maye with feithefull remembraunce and with moste attentiue mynde spiritually eate thesame with youre selues: and that, as ye eate breade with your body, so ye maye eate my fleashe with your solle.

            <p>It is further to be considered, that Paule wrote vnto the Corinthians, whyche were a people not altogyther destitute of fayeth: but they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected wyth certaine infirmities, and as for such kinde of people, we haue not sayde that they receyue onelye the sygnes, and not to haue the body of Christe: but it is of infideles, Epicuria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that thynke there is no god, and of suche as are cutte of frome the congregation, of suche it is (I saye) that we pronounce that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the sygnes onelye.</p>
            <p>Wherfore it myght well be sayd to the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s not only as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng the signes, but also as touching

the thyng of the Sacrament, that they were guiltie of the bodye and bloud of the lorde, and that they didde not putte a difference betwene the Lordes bodye, for asmuche as thei receiued the thynges with feith, and did not expresse the same feith in theyr liuyng. And here this thyng also is diligently to be marked, that Paule whan he traicteth of the sacramentall accion or dooing, that is to wete, of eatynge and drynkynge of the sacrament at the veray receyuyng of it, he so spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of it, that he calleth it breade, saying: Who so eateth this breade. &amp;c: but afterwarde whan he goeth about to shewe the fault of ill receiuing it how great and grieuous it is, than doeth he so make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of it, that he calleth it the lordes bodye. Ferther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more if the matier bee well examined, and iustely reko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it shall bee found that in all his trai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>yng of this Sacramente, the Apostle hath oftener expressed the name of bread, then he hath mencioned the Lordes body. For ye maye well fynd that fiue tymes he made expresse mencion of breade: but of the Lordes bodye no more but fower tymes. But now is it to bee seene and considered, what occasions thei bee that dooe so earnestly moue vs to take this clause and sayinge of Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ste, This is my body, as a thing figurately spoken. Fyrst and formoste we dooe consider that Christ himselfe was presente at the supper, so that it was a thyng nedelesse for hym to shewe his bodye to the Apostles. For thei sawe hym there presente with theyr yies. Secondly how coulde it possibly bee doen, that hymselfe should really and corporally or bodylye eate his owne selfe? And that he did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with his Apostles, is not onely aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmed by the old fathers
<pb facs="tcp:19768:56"/>
and auncient wryters, but also Christ hymselfe doeth saye it, as thou haste in the ghospell of Matthewe, wher Christ sayeth: After this tyme I shall not drynke of this fruite of the vinetree. Ferthermore we haue a regard, that here it is treated of the memoryal and remembraunce of his death and passion, wherein is well to be notifyed that there is a figuratiue speakyng in the woordes. And as for these transubstanciatours we se that thei dooe chaunge the tymes, so that, that whiche is spoken by the future tense, that is to saye, for the tyme to come, or by the presentense, that is to saye, for the tyme that is now<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> present, of the delyueryng of the Lordes bodye and of the sheddyng foorth of his bloud: that same dooe thei expoune by the preter tense, that is to saye, for the time past. After all this, we ferther consider that they can not lacke tropes in the consecratyng of the sacrament, for this woorde, <hi>Est, is,</hi> they take for conuertitur, is chaunged, or transubstanciatur, is transubstanciated or chaunged insubstaunce, or els forfyt is made. And forasmuche as Christ did institute it as a sacrament, and for a sacrament it is conuenient that the signes be taken accordinge to their significacions and betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges of the thyng, and that they bee taken as figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly spoken accordyng to the nature of a sacrament, whiche is, that it be a signe. We haue also a respecte to the ascension of Christe into heauen, and to the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee and trueth of his humayne nature whiche he toke here vpon hym, and also to that that is conteyned in. S. Iohns ghospell whan it is sayed to the Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites: My woordes are spirite and lyfe, the
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:19768:56"/>
fleashe profiteth nothyng, (as in dede true it is, if it bee carnally and fleashly eaten:) the spirite it is, that geueth lyfe: And agayne we consider Paule who in this place to the Corinthians doeth in moste playne woordes, put the terme of <hi>Breade,</hi> where neuerthelesse these men will nedes haue that there is a trope and a figure, thoughe they so greatlye abhorre that in the other place of oures there shoulde bee anye trope. We heare also Paule hymselfe witnessing that the auncient fathers of the olde testament had the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray selfe same sacramentes that we nowe haue. For, as Austen recordeth, he thoughte it not enoughe that thei had spirituall meate and drinke, but he also added, <hi>cundem,</hi> that is to saye, the veray same. And agayne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou shouldest, not doubte but that Paule me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te that theyr sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and ours are al one, he expressed baptisme by name, whiche baptisme he sayeth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers atteigned and had in the sea and in the cloude. Wherof it is euident that the saied fathers of the olde lawe had theyr sacramentes not onely emonge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but also that thei had the veraye same that we haue. We see also that other sayinges of the scripture beeyng veraye nere and muche lyke vnto this saying that we traicte of, are euen of these our aduersaries ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken as woordes figurately spoken. For it is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed: The breade whiche we breake, is the Communion or partakynge of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bodye. And, this cuppe is the newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamente. &amp;c. which woordes we haue now som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what often rehearsed. Besides all this, it dooeth not
<pb facs="tcp:19768:57"/>
properly agree nor accorde to the bodye of Christ for to bee eaten.</p>
            <p>And of the premisses it is open at ful and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, what ought to bee sayed to the secound argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the transubstanciatours, in whiche thei ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected against vs, that a sentence or clause in scripture ought not to be taken after any trope or figure, except there were some thyng conteyned either afore, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng after in the same sentence whiche did aduise and iustly moue vs that it wer so to bee dooen.</p>
            <p>And thei went ferther with vs also, allegynge that wher Christ saieth: this is my body, that shalbe geuen vp for you, we did take the latter part of this sentence in the bare and propre sence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any chaunge or alteracion which thyng is manifestlye false, for so muche as we there chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the tymes, and do not admitte or take it to be the same bodye whiche was betrayed and geuen vppe to death for vs. For that bodye was not alonelye visible but also passible. Neyther can there be in one and the same substaunce or subiecte at one and the same tyme the properties and qualities of a bodye corruptible together with the gyftes and properties of a bodye glorifyed: so that one and thesame body at one instau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t tyme should bee bothe passible and not passible. And besydes this we haue nowe alreadye showed what other places caused vs to admitte the figures afore spoken of and declared, that is to wete, Synecdoche and <hi>Metonimia</hi> where the thynge instituted is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the auctoure, that is to saye, for hym that dyd insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute it.</p>

Whereunto we aunswere, that suche thynges as of themselues are in suche sorte dyuerse, &amp; vnlyke, and disseuered or contrary of nature and kinde the one to the other: yet yf they bee well ioigned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wel applyed and proporcioned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one to the other for the better signifying and expressinge of a thynge, they maye nowe in suche case bee so ioygned together that they will make a good proposicion and a perfecte sentence. Whiche thing we see to haue been dooen not onely of Christe where he sayeth, The seed is the worde of God &amp; in another place, I am a vine tre: but also of Paule where he saieth, that we all are one breade, &amp; in another place, the breade whiche we breake is the partakyng and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the body of Christ: and agayn: this cup is the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in my blud. Nor we do not muche passe on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that some saie, that Mathew &amp; Mark did in plain &amp; expresse wordes say, this is my bloud of the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. &amp;c. for we deny not but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> these <hi>Euangelistes</hi> did so write, but in the meane tyme we stifly hold &amp; saye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wordes which Luke and Paule haue writen, are to bee recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:19768:58"/>
and allowed too, aswell as the others. And those woordes of Luke and Paule we affirme (as we haue saied of the other sentences) that thei are made of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des so ferre disagreyng and disseuered in theyr natures that they maye after the sayd schoole terme of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be but wel called <hi>disparata</hi>: but yet in the way of signifying and for the better expressing of the mattier that is ment and entended by theim, they bee veraye aptly ioygned and knitte together and do veraye well accorde.</p>

To this we answer &amp; lay again for vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> likewise Christ neuer sayed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his body laye lurkyng and hidden vnder those accidentes without a subiecte (as the transubstanciacioners doe imagyn,) nor Christ did neuer saye that the substance and matier of the bread dooeth cease to bee there in the sacrament or that it was chaunged and turned by any kinde of transubstanciation into the substaunce of his body, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ferther I do muche meruaile how men can obiecte those thynges in this wyse against vs, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng that these exposicions that it be taken in that sence are moste playnelye conteyned and expressed in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and auncient writers of the churche.

            <p>For many thynges he speaketh of sygnyfyeng, and that these sacramentes bee called, or sayd to bee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bodye: whyche thynges we dooe not denye.

In the olde lawe, there was offred a lambe, there was offred a calfe: nowe in the newe lawe is Christe offered, but he is offered as a man, and as one that receiueth his passion, but he himselfe offrethe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as a priest, that he maye putte awaye our synnes: here as if wer in an Image or similitude, there in veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, where he maketh intercessyon as an Aduocate for vs before hys father. And vpon the fyrste epistle to the Corynthyens, (as we haue before alleged) the same Ambrose thus sayeth: In eatynge and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge we dooe represente or sygnyfye the fleashe and bloude of Chryste, whyche thynges bee offred.

Whiche same selfe thinge also he wrote in the sixtieth and sixtieth one Homelie, vnto the people of Antioche: affyrmyng that we, not onelye by faithe and charitee: but in veray dede: are made and are ioyned and anex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Christes body.

But here is to bee marked, that althoughe we holde Christes bodye to be eaten, and his bloud to be drounke through feith in receyuing of this sacrament yet vpon this receyuyng by feyth there doeth foorthe with folowe not a feyned ioygning but a true and an effectuall couplyng betwene vs and Christe, through the whiche ioygning of vs to Christe not onelye oure mynde and solle is vnited and knitte vnto Christe and made one with hym: but also oure body and our flesh hath therby a certayne restoryng and renewyng, so that we are therby truly and verayly made the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Lorde, and we receyue Christe whiche is

            <p>These woordes of Austen can make no thynge againste vs. For we make no denyall at all but that the fleashe of Chryste is to be wurshipped, because of the ioygninge and couplyng that it hath wyth hys other nature of hys Godhed.

<pb facs="tcp:19768:77"/>
be made one with hym, as he and his father bee one betwene themselues. The text or sentence is in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth chapitur of Iohns ghospel, whece it is sayd: Neuerthelesse I pray not for them alone but for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also which shal beleue on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through theyr preachinge, that they all maye bee one as thou father arte in me, and I in thee: that they also maye be one in vs, that the worlde maye beleue that thou haste sente me. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Heretiques did putte this glose to it that we and Christe wer none otherwyse ioygned and knitte together, but by consente and vnitie of wille: and ther of they gatheredde and concludedde, that ther was in like mannier none other couplynge and knittinge together of the sonne of god with the father, but only thissame knittynge together and vnion of mynde and wyll. It was <hi>Hilarius</hi> parte therefore to decclare that we are knitte and made one with Christe naturallye, that he might conclude, that the sonne of God also is naturally ioyned to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father in very substaunce. The prouing therfore of <hi>Hilarius</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> renneth thus: If the sonne of God did truly &amp; verily take the nature or substaunce of man vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym he agreeth with vs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in his fleshe, &amp; we bee sayed to abide in him be cause he hath oure nature in hym.

<pb n="lxxiii" facs="tcp:19768:77"/>
thus doeth <hi>Hilarius</hi> take and frame his argumente of the veritee and trueth of the sacramentes, whiche veri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tee or to bee in the sacramentes we dooe not denye. And this was a common custome emong the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent wryters, to fetche the grounde of theyr argumen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes out of the Sacramentes as thinges most perfitly knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to al Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And of al these thinges there is not one iote that is contrary to our sentence and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terminacion. For it is no part of Hilarius entente to proue that Christes fleashe lieth hidden vnder the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes of bread, or in this sacrament: but he maketh proufe onely and so concludeth, that we bee truely and verayly ioyned vnto Christes fleshe whan we recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the sacrament, which thing we do not deny nor say agaynst.

            <p>But now after the transubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiacyons, god should

not haue ioygned hys godly power or hys godhed vnto these thynges: but he shuld clene haue put away these other natures of breade and wyne.</p>
            <p>And the reason and circumstaunce of the sayed com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>parison dooeth require, that lyke as the ioygnyng of baptesme wyth grace and wyth the holy ghoste doeth not put awaye nor destruye the nature, of the water: euen so the thynges of thys sacramentes should not destruye or cast awaye the beeyng and the true natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of the signes. Damascene sayeth morouer that god did so condescende vnto our custome &amp; vsage, that by meane of suche thynges as are familiarly vsed emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs, and are within the ordre and course of nature, we shoulde bee placed and sette in those thynges whiche are aboue nature. In whyche place he toucheth also of our chaungeyng into Christe. But it is here to bee noted, that he affirmeth the outward signes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier of the sacramentes to bee thynges accordynge to nature, that is to saye, naturall thynges, and thynges of their own natures.</p>
            <p>That yf ye putte thesame to bee accidentes onelye and withoute a subiecte, or accidentes that haue the bodye of Christe hidden vnder them: than are thei not any longer to bee taken for thynges of theyr owne na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, or for thynges within the ordre and course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>And Damascen vseth suche playne termes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matier that he affirmeth the nature of bread to be chaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged ouer, to bee taken to another thynge and to be made Christes body: which wordes chaunge
<pb facs="tcp:19768:84"/>
yf they bee taken and vnderstanded of a Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall chaunge, they make nothynge at all agaynste vs.</p>
            <p>And where he also sayeth that these chaunges happen aboue nature, we admitte and graunte that too. For it is not of any naturall propretee belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge vnto common breade, that a sacrament shoulde bee made thereof, no more then the fountayne of oure regeneracion or newe birth to bee made naturallye of water.</p>
            <p>That yf ye demaunde of Damascene the manier howe this chaungeynge of the breade into Christes body commeth to passe: he aunswereth that it is not a lyghte mattier euen for vs to expresse the mannier howe breade in oure naturall foode and susteinaunce is chaunged into oure fleashe.</p>
            <p>But as touchynge this similitude and compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son howe it maye bee taken, we haue sayed sufficiently afore whan we spake of Theophylactus. If ye take this similitude generallye, and applye it to a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall chaunge, it is veraye well, but if ye will haue the comparison specially made of suche a mutacion or chaungeynge, as there is of the foode that we take in oure bodyes, whan it is turned into our fleashe: than shall ye make not onelye the nature of breade to geue place and to departe awaye, but also the acciden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes therof to dooe thesame.</p>
            <p>Damascene after all this affirmeth the breade so to bee made Christes bodye, and the wyne and water in suche wyse to bee made his bloude, that the
<pb n="lxxx" facs="tcp:19768:84"/>
same are nowe not twoo thynges, but one. If he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this terme, to bee one thynge, and not twayne, to the cuppe and the breade, as though he should saye that these twoo are one Sacramente: We wyll make no greate a dooe in the mattier, (for in this accion or dooyng, as in one Sacramente, Christe is offred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, for a foode.</p>
            <p>And yet in takynge bothe partes of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, the Churche is not a fearde to speake of theym as thoughe they were twoo, and to saye, that there bee Sacramentes here. And in the collectes whiche they were woont to saye in theyr olde Masse they did after the communion manye tymes saye these woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</p>
            <p>The Sacramentes whiche we haue receyued. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But an yf they affirme them in suche wyse to bee one, that after the consecracion the breade and Christes bodye bee nowe one thyng, and notte twayne, for the transubstanciation that is incedente vnto it: than wyll we sette agaynste this the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and determinacion of Ireneus, in whiche he wryteth the Sacramente of <hi>Eucharistia</hi> to consiste of twoo thynges, the one yearthelye, and the other heauenlye: We also sette agaynste theym Gelasius sometyme Byshop of Rome who speakyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the humayne nature and diuine nature in Christe, bothe the sayde natures remayning wholle and vnde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyled, argueth and proueth it to bee true by the conio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and couplyng of the bread with Christes bodye in this sacramente, bothe natures remaynynge whole
<pb facs="tcp:19768:85"/>
and perfect. He affirmeth moreouer that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not cast downe in the draught. Neyther can it in veray dede otherwyse bee spoken of the transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanciatours. For wheras they put and holde that in this sacrament of <hi>Eucharistia</hi> there is nothynge but the accidentes of breade and of wyne, and the nature of Christes bodye: there doeth no parte of these thynges belong to any draught. But against the premisses I wyll now bryng in and obiecte a most manifest place of Origen vpon Mathew in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiftenth chaptur, wher he expouneth and declareth these woordes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelist: That that entreth i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to the mouth, defileth not a man. And there dooeth Origen saye thus:<note place="margin">Origens mynde of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goe into the draughte or not.</note> If it dooe not defyle a man, than dooeth it not sanctifie hym and make hym holy neither. But what shall we saye of the Lordes breade? Is it true that it neyther maketh a man holye, nor defileth hym? he aunswereth: that lyke as if any thing seme vnpure, it nothynge at all defyleth vs except through a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt conscience in vs: Euen so also that that appereth and is called holy, dooeth not sanctifye vs nor make vs holy, vnlesse there bee righteousnesse wythin vs, and perfectenesse of life. For if of it owne nature it had the propretee to sanctifie &amp; to make holy: than should there not haue been many sicke emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Corinthians, and many haue died. Where fore that that is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall or grosse and corruptible in the lordes breade, dooeth passe down into the bealie, and is cast o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="lxxxi" facs="tcp:19768:85"/>
is profitable: but the woord that is put thereto is the thynge that auayleth. And to the entente that one shoulde not thynke hym to speake of any other meate: he repeateth it agayne in a briefe summe, and sayeth: Thus muche haue we spoken of the mystycall and Sacramentall bodye of Christe.</p>
            <p>Nowe leate not anye manne to impougne this that we haue sayed, cauill and saye, that Origen did nowe and than erre in diuerse opinions and articles. For Hierome, Epiphanius, and the olde aunciente fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whiche didde with all possible diligence searche and bryng foorth his erroures to lyghte, dooe not in anye place make mencion that he was in anye wronge opinion of the Sacramente, whiche thynge they woulde neuer haue leafte vnspoken, yf he hadde in so greate a mattier gonne neuer so lytle oute of square.</p>
            <p>And Origen in the place afore alleged moste mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly and plainly addeth these woordes also, that the wycked sorte dooe not eate Christes bodie, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se that Christes bodye is a thyng that geueth life, and he that eateth it, abydeth in Christe. Wherfore agaynst thys Ihon Damascene beeyng but a newe wryter of late yeres, &amp; a man not of so great a name to speake of, leat Origene bee sette, who is bothe a veray auncient wryter and also estemed of al men for a ryght famous Clerke.</p>

Lastely there was an argument brought of the vertue and efficacie of goddes woorde, whyche (as Algerius citeth and allegeth in the seuenth chapitur of his first booke) is called of Ambrose <hi>uerbum operatorium</hi> as if ye should saye in englishe a word of workyng &amp; of operacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as by the whiche worde the breade &amp; wyne whiche remaine stil in their natures are yet neuerthelesse chaunged into another thyng.

Unto what soeuer persones suche woordes dooe come, it conteineth and hath wyth it hys owne propre sense and menyng. But if it come to men of good vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng, thesame dooe heare it wyth some profit, for they dooe well perceiue the thynges that are spoken.

And by thesame also it is proued that the wyeked dooe not receiue the lordes bodye, euen lyke as vnskilful or ignoraunt persones whan they heare talke in greke or latin, dooe not perceiue the sense and menyng therof. Wherupon conclude, that there could not any thyng haue been spoken more strongly on our syde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys similitude of Algerius. Thesame Algerius also in the fyrst chapitur of the second booke aduoucheth that the accidentes in thys sacramente dooe not veraily and truely susteme rottenesse or mouldryng away, but onely that it so appereth vnto vs, and yet is not so in dede, whyche thyng euen the veray scholemen would not haue sayed. For what other thyng is thys, but to establishe a perpetual illusion and blyndyng of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes senses? Thus than we nede not muche to passe of Algerius, though he labour by all meanes possible to ratifie and sette vp hys transubstanciacion. We haue now traicted of the fyrst opinion, and that at large.

Thys wyll we graunte wyth a good will, that the diuyne nature &amp; godhede of Chryste is euery where: Yet will we not attribute the same to hys bodye in hys humanytee. And this dooeth Austen moste plainly teache in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle of his to one Dardanus And as touching that whyche is alleged out of the thyrde chapitur of Iohn, the same Austen dooeth interprete and expoune it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it must be vnderstanded of his deuine nature, that the soonne of man was in heauen.

thys place. For he affyrmeth that to bee in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not alttributed vnto the sonne of man but according to this most excellent nature of the godhed. But how weake thys argumente is, that these twoo natures are ioygned together: ergo what so euer is graunted to the one, must olso bee altributed to the other: maye bee well shewed and proued by other argumentes. The bodye or balle of the sunne that shyneth in the skye, &amp; the lyght of the same sunne haue betwene them selues a naturall and a moste high coniunctyon: and yet the same bodye of the sunne dooeth not really and verayly reache to al places that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light dothe extende it self vnto.

<pb facs="tcp:19768:99"/>
For although we should grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the body of Christe might haue this prerogatiue to bee in manye places at once. Yet shoulde it not folow that God wil so doe in this sacrament. Yet ferther they laboure and trauaile to proue this corporall presence of Christe in the Sacrament by the similitude of a teacher that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a lecture to an audience: who in that that he maie extende his woordes to many hearers, doeth also in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate and vtter vnto all his hearers and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience all that lyeth in his mynde to vtter vnto them so that all the sayde audience euery one of them maye fully and perfectly vnderstande the botome of his hert as well one as another.

            <p>He dooeth (as it were) enwrappe his bodye in them, that by the same it maye be conueyghed vnto all those signes or cakes of breade, and maye so bee communicated and distributed vnto all the receyuers thereof, howe manye soeuer bee of them.</p>

Neither can thei well fynde faulte with this manyer of arguynge or reasoninge as though this fourme of arguyng were not good. For Hierome vseth euen the same manier of resonyng against Iohn the byshop of Hierusalem, where he mindeth to proue that oure bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes after the resurrection maie endewe without fode.

            <p>Uerayly verayly I saye vnto you, wheresoeuer there shall bee two or three gathered together in my name: there am I in the middes of them. For lyke as euen at that tyme whan he was conuersaunt on yearth as a

            <p>And wyth these men agreeth Uigilius, who in the fyrst booke against Eutiches wryteth in thys manier. The sonne of god after hys humanitee departed away from vs: but after hys godhed he sayeth vnto vs. Beholde, I am wyth you vntyl the ende of the worlde. And the same man not many lines a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet aswell beeyng pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent as absent he is one &amp; the same vnto vs. Again in the fowerth boke: If the nature of the woorde &amp; of the fleashe bee but one nature: how happeneth that wheras the woorde is euery where, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleashe also is not found euery where? For wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was on yearth, certes he was not in heauen, and now, because he is in heauen, certes he is not on yearth. And so ferreforth is he not on yearth, that as touchyng the fleashe we looke for Christ to come down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen whom after the word, we beleue to bee wyth vs vpon yearth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19768:106"/>Therefore after your opinion, eyther the woorde is conteined and encoumpaced in some certain place together wyth hys fleashe: or els the fleashe is euery where together wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woorde.

Also whan he had saied of Lazarus: Lazarus is dead, he added thereto, and saied: I am glad for your sakes, that ye maye beleue, because I was not there. And to declare the infinitenesse of his godhed, he saieth vnto his disciples: Beholde I am with you al the daies vntil the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>summacion of the worlde. How did he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de vp into heauen, but that he is a veray man in dede &amp; placeable?

            <p>Besides thys there is there conteined a certain token or pledge wherbye the Christianes dooe note theym selfes ioygned and knitte together emong themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes and with Chryste, &amp; besydes this, they professe their feyth concernyng the bodye of Chryste nailled on the crosse, and concernynge his bloud that was shed forth for our redempcion For it is not enough to beleue with the herte, but confession is made wyth the mouth too, and not onelye wyth the mouthe, but also wyth oute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde dooinges.

            <p>For els forasmuche as it is receiued by feith, it is not vnderstanded to bee vtterly absent, though hys abydynge bee in heauen as touchyng his nature and his substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

            <p>They allege after this the fathers who dooe in plain and manifest woordes geue a determinate sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and saye precisely, that here is a type or countre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine, a signe, &amp; a figure of Christes bodye. And they bryng in for theyr purpose twoo similitudes or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, One is of a frende, vnto whom his frende that is absent is yet neuerthelesse sayed to bee present wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mynde or thought renneth on hym. Also they putte many lookyng glasses whiche are in a circuit round about one and thesame man, whose looke and face is multiplied throughe out all these glasses euery one of them, though the man moue not out of his place. In dede I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that these are similitudes though some what to cold to agree well wyth thys misterie.

But of thys thyrd knittyng of vs wyth Christ we shal traicte here a litel after.

that the vngodly should receiue the bodye of the lorde I doe not admitte.

               </gap> that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiles are made felowe heyres and concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall wyth Christe: and the greke woorde therof is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> For although we putte that the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and takyng of Christes bodye is dooen by feyth: yet notwythstanding at thys conceiuing and takyng, there foloweth effectually a true coniunction (I saye) betwene vs and Christe, (and not a feigned or ymagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue coniunction) whiche first perteyneth to the solle and then redoundeth vnto the bodye.<note place="margin">We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we dooe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and incorporacion of vs wyth Christe, is commended vnto vs in the holy scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of Paule, vnder a comparison of the head and the bodye, whan he calleth vs me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres of one bodye vnder Christe whiche is the head: and vndre a comparison of the state and condicion of wedlocke, wherin twoo are made one fleashe. Whyche thyng to expresse, Cyrillus brought forth a like exaumple of molten wax whyche beeyng myxte wyth other waxe beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of two sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces one substaunce. Euen so is it Cyrillus mynde that Christe is ioygned vnto vs. And to this purpose dooe the woordes of Paule to the Ephesians make verai greatly. Where it is saied, that we are of his fleshe, and of his bones.<note place="margin">Whether Christ be of our fleshe or we of hys fleashe.</note> Which woordes at the first sight whan a man looketh on theim, seme to haue another menyng, and seme that thei ought to haue ben spoken another waie, that is to wete, that the sonne of God is of our flesh and of our bones because he toke fleashe of our kynde. But Paule vnderstode not bare and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon fleashe, but suche fleashe as wer clene from synne, fleashe apte to receiue the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and immortalitee. Whyche kynde of fleashe the feith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, forasmuche as they haue it not of theymselfes, nor yet by the procreation of Adam they doe chalenge &amp; take it of Christ wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei are incorporated into him by the sacramentes, and by feith. Thus than there happeneth a certain slidynge and issuynge of Chryste into vs,<note place="margin">The issuing of Christe in to vs.</note> and a certain spirytuall touchynge whyche Paule considered &amp; wel weighed, whan he sayd to the Galathians: I lyue, yet not I, but Chyste lyueth in me.</p>
            <p>Neyther it is necessarye that for these thynges Chryste shoulde bee dyspersed and scattered aboute throughoute infinyte places. For all that euer we dooe here teache is spirituall. And yet is it not a fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned thynge nor phantasticall. For phantasies, idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, or thynges imagined and feigned, dooe not fede the solle as it is certayn that it is dooen herein this sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cramente. For we haue saied, and dooe confyrme, that these materiall sygnes dooe moste truely sygnyfye, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presente, and exhibite vnto vs the bodye of Chryste, to bee eaten: howebeit it is spiritually, that is, wyth the mouth of the solle to bee eaten, and not of the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye.</p>
            <p>If ye demaunde howe the fathers of the olde lawe coulde haue the selfe same thynge in theyr sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes that we haue: the aunswer is easy to bee made.</p>
            <p>For we haue concluded that in thys sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te the matier is not dooen corporallye, but spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And it is read in the Apocalypse, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lambe was offred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the world. The fathers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old law awaited for thinges to come, &amp; we remembre

the thinges that now alreadie past. Finally this on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly thing we shewe and declare necessarie to bee taken hede vnto: whyche is, that the same whyche we dooe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes adde of the spirituall manier of receyuyng ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to bee preiudicyall or de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e vnto the trueth. For Austen saied vpon the fiftie fowerth psalme, that the lordes bodye is in a certain and determinate place, that is to wete, in heauen: but the trueth of the lordes bodye is euerye where. For wheresoeuer the faithfull bee, they conceyue and beleue that Chryste had a true bodye in dede whyche was geuen for vs, and by feith thei eate thesame. Thus haue I said my minde what ought to be dooen accordyng to the scriptures in this matier of the sacramente. Whiche thinges I woulde wyshe the godly reader well to examine and pondre, &amp; thesame to take in good pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te. God of his goodnesse graunt that the Churche of Chryst maie once obteine to come to the truth, and also to a concord &amp; peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernynge thys sacrament. Whyche twoo thinges I dooe for thys cause wishe and desire, for that I consi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dre the sacramente of <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> wherof we treacte, to haue ben hitherto ouerwhelmed, buried, &amp; deformed with lyes, deceyptes, and supersticions, that it might bee rather estemed any other thynge then that whiche the lorde in his supper did institute.</p>
            <p>Whiche churche to the entent we should not haue ease<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly or soone pourged, the deuil beyng a most greuous enemie to all peace and trueth, hath sowen so many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, contencions, debates, Heresies, and battailes in manier euen to bloudshed &amp; manslaughter: that an vniforme and reasonable consent and agrement therin suche as is mete for Christen people to haue, semeth
<pb n="cx" facs="tcp:19768:113"/>
in a manier vnpossible to be hoped for. Howebeit (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las) we suffre these thynges not without desert, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> that we haue dishonoured this sacramente two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier of wayes: partely in that that of this so excellent and so singuler a gifte of Christe, we haue erected and sette vp an execrable Idoll: and partly for that we haue vsurped these holye mysteries with an vnclene feith, with a conscience polluted with moste greuous synnes, without any due profe or examinacion of our selues. Wherfore I beseche almighty god, that he wil take pitie vpon this great calamitie, &amp; that he vouche<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>safe once to restore vnto his Churche the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of <hi>Eucharistia</hi> truelye receiued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored: and I beseche hym that he wyl graunt vs the right vse thereof through Iesus Christ oure Lorde.
