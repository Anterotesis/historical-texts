            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Thoſe Plates which you intend to forge and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,

in their forgeing and planiſhing they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſomewhat thinner. You muſt planiſh your
Copper cold, as the Silver-Smiths do their Plate:
And the more it is beaten or planiſhed with an
hammer, the firmer it is, and leſſe ſubject to holes
or flaws.</p>
               <p>Your Plate being well planiſhed, make choice of
the ſmootheſt ſide for poliſhing: Before you begin

it, let your board (to which the plate is fixed)
ſtand a little declining or ſloping.</p>
               <p>To poliſh your Plate, take a piece of a Grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſtone
about the bigneſſe of your fiſt, and fair
water, and rub it firmly, and evenly all over; and
in your rubbing throw water often on it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſo doing, till you cannot perceive any dints,
or flaws, or marks of the hammer: Then waſh it
clean with water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Afterward take a good Pumice-ſtone,
and rub the ſame Plate with it and water, till
there appear none of the rough ſtroaks, or marks
of the ſtone: Then waſh it clean with water, as
you did before.</p>
               <p>Again, do the ſame thing with a fine ſmooth
Hoan and water, till all the marks of the Pumice-ſtone
are quite rubbed out: This done, waſh it
clean with fair water.</p>
               <p>Then chooſe out a Chark-cole ſmooth, without
any knots, or rough grain, and put it in a well-kindled
fire: let it be there, till you may perceive
it red hot; Then take it out of the fire, and
immediately quench it in cold water; Then
take it out, and pair off the uttermoſt rind, and

rub your Plate with it, and water, till all the ſmall

               <p>After you have thus poliſhed it with a Chark-cole,

ſome of the Varniſh with a little ſtick, and put a

grow cold, heat it again as before, being very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to keep it from duſt or filth. This done (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

               <p>After this tapping, wipe or ſlide your hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Take great care, that there be not too much Varniſh

points which you intend to make uſe of, in

round, that they may turn more freely upon the

thoſe Oval points, and that part next to C de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes

Not but that it may be uſed otherwiſe, with the face
of the Oval turned towards the midle-finger as it is

you, that if you lean lightly in making your ſtrokes,
thoſe ſtrokes will accordingly be leſſe deep, ſmaller,
and more faint; for the harder you lean, the deeper
and larger your ſtrokes will be. Of this you have an
example in the third figure marked r n s; where lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

your ſmall needle lengthen out your ſtroke, as you
find it repreſented in the two ſtrokes of the fifth Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
               <p>Some will firſt make their ſtroke with a round
needle, and then paſte it over again with an Oval
point to inlarge it in thoſe places which they would
have deeper and bigger; but the other is the better
way.</p>
               <p>They that know how to grave after they have
done etching their lines with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> may with
the aſſiſtance of their graver make them more neat
and deeper.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only think it not amiſſe to adviſe you by
the way, that in making your ſtrokes with your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
points, you muſt hold them as upright and
ſtreight in your hand as you can, and accuſtome
your ſelf to ſtrike your ſtrokes firm and bold, for
that will contribute very much to their neatneſſe
and clearneſſe. To do this the better, you muſt be
very carefull to have your points alwayes well
whetted.</p>
               <p>In thoſe places which you would have appear in
your piece by way of Landskip, that is at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
diſtance from the ſight, as alſo in thoſe places
which approach neareſt the light, you muſt uſe a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſlender point, leaning ſo lightly with your hand,
as to make a ſmall faint ſtroke. But when you come to
thoſe places which you would have more ſhadowed,
lean ſo much the harder, as that when you come to
eat it in with your <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> you may cover moſt of
your faint places at one and the ſame time, for you
muſt know that thoſe ſtrokes, which you lean lighteſt
on, do little more then raiſe up the varniſh. So that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52916:19"/>
when you ſhall apply your <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> to etch it, it
will appear much fainter then in thoſe places where
you have leaned with greater force, though the
ſtrokes are done with one and the ſame needle. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
that when you ſhall have cover'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of your faint places with your mixture,
thoſe places, whereon you lean'd more ſtrongly, will
appear deepeſt, though they were all covered at the
ſame time. In your working be carefull to bruſh off
all the duſt which you work off with your needles.</p>

the plate; as alſo how to cover the places, that are
fainteſt and moſt remote from the eye, with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned

               <p>HAving obſerv'd the way of placing the plate
for the receiving of the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
only to conſider the method you are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in caſting it on as occaſion ſhall require; for in
ſome works it will be neceſſary to caſt it on ſeverall
times, for the reaſons hereafter to be mentioned.
Having a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> in your
pan, fill your earthen pot, and poure it upon your
plate, beginning at the top, and moving your hand
equally ſo that it may run all over the plate, taking
great heed that the pot touch not the plate. Having
ſo pour'd 8. or 10. times, the plate being as in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
expreſs'd in the precedent figure, you muſt turn
it croſſe-wayes, as is repreſented in the upper part of
the following figure marked C, and poure on it as
it lies that way ten or twelve times as before: That
done, turn your plate ſuitably to the poſture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
by the lower part of the following figure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
that is to ſay, corner-wiſe, and as it lies ſo,
poure thereon eight or ten times; pouring the <hi>Aqua
fortis</hi> thus at ſeverall times, for the ſpace of half a
quarter of an hour, more or leſſe, according to the
ſtrength or the water, and nature of the copper.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52916:22"/>
For if the copper be brittle and hard, there muſt
be the leſſe time allow'd for the pouring on of the
water; but if ſoft, the more.</p>
               <p>And whereas you may not haply at the firſt be
ſo well aſſured of the ſtrength of your water, and
the preciſe quality of your copper, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
to give you ſome directions how to know both,
that you may proceed according to the ſtrength of
neatneſſe which you expect to find in your work.
For there are ſome pieces require more force, and
ſome more tenderneſſe then others. To know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the nature of your copper, and the ſtrength of
your water, that they be ſuch as the work you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
doth require, pour of it on your plate, for the
firſt time, as is before mention'd, for the ſpace of the
fourth part of a quarter of an hour. Then take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the plate, and caſt on it a quantity of fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
holding the pot at a good height from the
plate, to waſh off the <hi>Aqua fortis;</hi> for if it be not
clean waſh'd, the work will appear green, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
you cannot ſo well perceive the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That done, hold your plate before the fire, at
ſuch a diſtance, as that, without melting the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which may be upon it, the fair water may be
dried up. Then take a little piece of charcole, and
therewith rub off the varniſh in ſome place where
the ſtrokes are faint: and if you find that the <hi>Aqua
fortis</hi> hath eaten deep enough in thoſe faint places,
melt your mixture, and having plac'd your plate
upon a desk or eaſell, take of the ſaid mixture with
a pencill fit for your work, and cover therewith all
thoſe places which you deſire ſhould be tender, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52916:22"/>
free from any further operation of the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi>
taking great care that you beſtow mixture thick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
on the places which you would have covered,
that is, that the mixture may fill up the ſtrokes. And
it is at this firſt operation, that you are to cover all
the fainteſt and ſweeteſt places.</p>
               <p>Having held your plate ſo long to the fire that the
moiſture is quite-taken off (a thing only neceſſary
in the winter time) put it again upon your board,
and pour on your water as before, for the ſpace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
half an hour, turning your plate from time to
time according to the ſeverall poſtures, as is before
expreſſed. That done, waſh off the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> with
fair water as before, and dry your plate by the fire,
taking eſpeciall care that you melt not the mixture
which you had before put upon it.</p>
               <p>Your plate being dri'd put it upon the desk or ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
as before, and having melted your mixture, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
therewith thoſe faint places and hatches that are
next in point of faintneſſe to thoſe that you had
covered before. The ſeverall degrees of faint<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe
in the hatches you have ſeverall examples
of in the following figure.</p>
               <p>You have been directed before how to guide your
needles and Ovall points, and I have told you how
you were to lean ſtrong and firmly on the places
where you would have the ſtrokes to be black and
deep, and ſlack and lighten your hand where you
would have them faint and tender, a thing which
very much facilitates the operation of the <hi>Aqua
fortis.</hi> For inſtance, when you have at the firſt time
with your mixture cover'd that part which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
by the line A B C D. which makes a kind of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52916:23"/>
an Oval: you come at the ſecond time to cover that
ſpace which is between the line A B C: and the line
E O F. conceiving well, that having ſuffered the
<hi>Aqua fortis</hi> to eat in for the time requiſite, it will
have an effect ſomewhat near that which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>At the upper end of the plate you have the form
of a woman's arm, wherein you may perceive, by
the line marked a b c d; as alſo by the other which
lies yet nearer the ſhadow, how the ſmall hatches
and fainter places are ordinarily covered at two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
operations, as occaſion ſhall require; though
in the forementioned example of the arm, one time
covering might haply ſerve.</p>
               <p>I have alſo thought fit at the bottome of the plate,
to ſet down four ſeverall pieces of ground in land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip,
the firſt marked m m m, is the firſt covered,
as being the fartheſt of all from the eye, then at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
operation that marked n n n; then that
marked o o o: there being only that marked p,
wherein the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> eats in full and deep.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, that the light or hard lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the points in their proper places in working,
may make the ſtrokes and hatchings ſo, as that the
<hi>Aqua fortis</hi> may eat in anſwerably to your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without the trouble of covering any places
with your mixture: To this I anſwer, that the
work will not altogether have that effect, but will be
like the ſecond plate, which I have purpoſely made
after that manner: for though you can lean harder
on ſome places, and lighter on others; yet the
<hi>Aqua fortis</hi> being pour'd equally all over the plate,
during the whole time, it muſt follow that ſome
<pb facs="tcp:52916:23"/>
                  <figure/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52916:24"/>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52916:24"/>
places will not be ſo ſweet and tender as they
ought, and ſhall come farre ſhort of that beautifull
and lively continuity which you may perceive in
thoſe lines and ſtrokes where you uſe the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>If it happen, that when you dry your plate by
the fire to take off the moiſture, as hath been ſaid
before, that the mixture for want of care, do melt
and run into thoſe hatches and ſtrokes where you
would have the water to eat in further; wipe the
place with a ſoft cloth, then take the crum of ſtale
bread, and rub the place therewith till ſuch time as
you conceive you have taken off all the greaſineſſe.
This remedy is only appliable in point of extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for you are to note, that it is impoſſible to take
out the greaſe ſo clearly, but that it will ſomewhat
hinder the operation of the <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> And
therefore there muſt be the more care taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it.</p>
               <p>Having thus cover'd your places as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
for the ſecond time place your plate on the
board aforeſaid, and pour on it your <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> for
another good half hour.</p>
               <p>That done, waſh it with water, and dry it as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
and cover the places you think requires it
for the third time, for you muſt know that the faint
places are to be proportionable to, that is, more or
leſſe, according to the ſeverall deſignes and pieces
you work upon. When you have done this, pour
on your <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> upon it for the laſt time, and it
is at this operation, that you are to beſtow more or
leſſe time above the precedent, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of your work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52916:25"/>
For inſtance, if there be in your plate ſuch
hatches and ſhadows as require much depth and
fulneſſe, and conſequently muſt be very black, you
are to pour on the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> for the ſpace of an
hour or better at this laſt operation alone, that is
proportionably to the precedent. You may well
imagine that there can be no certain rule given in
generall, either as to the convenient covering of
the places, or the preciſe ſpace of time that is to be
obſerv'd in caſting on the water: for it is not
to be conceiv'd that <hi>Callot</hi> pour'd as much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on his little pieces as he did on thoſe that were
greater.</p>
               <p>I told you before, how that you may rub off your
varniſh or ground as occaſion requires, with a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole,
to ſee whether the water hath eaten in deep
enough: you are therefore to judge of the ſpace of
time that you are to employ in pouring on the <hi>Aqua
fortis,</hi> by the works you are to do, and where I tell
you that you may beſtow an hour and better on the
laſt operation, my meaning is, in pieces that require
much blackneſſe. All which notwithſtanding, it is
to be conſidered that all copper and all ſorts of
<hi>Aqua fortis</hi> not being of the ſame ſtrength, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and equality, you are to proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>Having therefore pour'd the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> upon
your plate for the ſpace of an hour, more or leſſe,
as the work requires as is before ſaid, waſh it again
with fair water; but you ſhall not need to dry it as
in the precedent operations; but put it wet as it is
upon the fire, till your mixture be all melted; and
then wipe it very clean on both ſides with a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52916:25"/>
cloth, till you have quite taken away all the
mixture.</p>

               <p>TAke a char-cole of willow or ſome ſuch ſoft
grain'd wood, and take off the rinde of it, and
pouring fair water on the plate, rub it with the
char-cole with an even hand, as if you were to
poliſh copper, and it will take off the varniſh.
Be carefull that no duſt or filth fall upon the plate;
as alſo that the char-cole be free from all knots
and roughneſs, for it might occaſion ſmall ſcratches
in the plate which it would be difficult to get out,
eſpecially in thoſe places which are moſt faint and
ſweet. Note that you are not to uſe ſuch a burnt
cole as you do to poliſh withall.</p>
               <p>When the varniſh is taken off, the plate is of an
unpleaſant colour, by reaſon of the operation of
the fire and water upon it. To reduce it therefore to
its proper colour, take ſome ordinary <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi>
to which add two third parts of fair water, and
with a little linnen ragg dipp'd therein, rub your
plate all over, and you will find it come to its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
colour and beauty.</p>
               <p>That done, take immediately a dry linnen ragg,
and wipe it all over ſo as to take off all the foreſaid
water. Then hold your plate a little to the fire,
and pour on it a little ſallad-oyl, and with the brims
of an old beaver roll'd up, rub your plate well all
over with it; then wipe it with a dry cloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52916:26"/>
This done, you will perceive plainly if there be
any places that require to be touch'd with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as it for the moſt part happens, eſpecially in
thoſe places that are to be moſt black. For you
may well judge, that when there are many ſtrokes
and hatchings one cloſe to another, there is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
varniſh between, that the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> commonly
takes it off, becauſe it eats under it.</p>
               <p>But if this happens when you caſt on your wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
you may preſently cover thoſe places where
you perceive the varniſh to break up with the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it being much more eaſie to touch it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with the graver, then when the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi>
hath made a pit therein, which at the working of
it off at the preſſe cauſes a great black patch; but
after ſome number of coppies taken off, the ſaid
patch ſeems to be white, becauſe there is not any
thing for the ink to faſten on.</p>
               <p>Having therefore in good time cover'd that
part, you have no more to do but to perfect thoſe
ſtrokes and hatchings to make them more firm and
beautifull; which done, your plate is ready for the

being thus heated, take the varniſh cover'd as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
and applying it by the end of the roller,
ſpread it upon the plate while it is hot, carrying it
lightly over from one ſide to the other, untill the
plate be covered thin and equally all over: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, and having a quill that hath a ſmooth
feather, take it, and with the broad ſide thereof
ſweep it gently over the varniſh and ſwiftly, to the
end it do not burn. The firſt time, the feathered
end of the quill ſhall onely ſerve to ſpread the var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
over the plate; but afterwards make choice of
another, the beſt feathered quill you have, and go
it over again lightly, that the varniſh may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
very equally all over the plate and very
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52916:27"/>
thin; for when it is laid on too thick, your work
cannot be ſo fine and delicate as otherwiſe it
would; and if the plate ſhould cool, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the varniſh, you muſt heat it a little again,
to the end that it may receive the varniſh as it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
through the linnen. Alſo take great care, for
your better eaſe in the ſpreading of it, that your
plate, and by conſequence your varniſh, happen
not to burn: Which that you may the more eaſily
perceive, take notice, that when it is too hot it
caſts it ſelf into little clots and pumples, by reaſon
of over much heat of the plate.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as you have evenly ſpread your varniſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your plate, black it over with the flame of a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
after the ſame manner as I have already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in ſpeaking of your hard varniſh: provided on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the flame approch not too near; this is to be
done in one caſe rather then in another, and that is,
when having blackt it all over, you perceive that
the ſmoke hath not entred within, by reaſon of its
growing cold: Therefore it will be convenient to
put your plate again over your chafing-diſh, and
you ſhall ſee, that as ſoon as the plate is hot, the
varniſh will diſſolve; and by conſequence, the black
which the ſmoke hath left upon the varniſh, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
pierce as farre as the plate.</p>
               <p>Be carefull above all, in doing this, to have a
moderate fire, and ſtill to remove your plate, in ſuch
ſort that the ſaid varniſh melt equally all over
without burning.</p>
               <p>After that, let your plate cool, and when you
ſhall think fit to work upon it, place your deſign al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
after the ſame manner, as upon your hard
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52916:28"/>
varniſh, (the backſide thereof being rubb'd with the
duſt of red chalk) excepting onely, that you muſt
not lean ſo hard on with your point in drawing
the out-lines of your deſign, leſt by ſo doing the
needle cutting through the paper ſhould raze the
varniſh.</p>
               <p>Next you proceed to work upon your plate with
the ſame kind of points, as thoſe which are
mentioned for hard varniſh, excepting thoſe Oval
points, which many that etch with ſoft varniſh
never uſe: Nevertheleſſe they are very commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
eſpecially for the working any piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,
or making of large ſtrokes; and it is at
the choice of thoſe that grave, either to uſe them
or not to uſe them: But there is one thing to be
conſidered, of which you are to have a very great
care, and that is, how to keep the ſoft varniſh upon
the plate, for it is very apt to be rubbed or razed
off, if any thing never ſo little violent happen to
touch it: There are ſeverall wayes of keeping it
unhurt; for example, working upon the plain, or
on a desk, you may have on the ſides of your plate
two little boards, of what bigneſſe you pleaſe, or
two little books of the ſame thickneſſe, and lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thin board upon them, ſo as that it may
not touch the plate, and reſt your hand upon this
board as you work.</p>
               <p>There are ſome which work with their plate laid
upon a kind of Eaſle, as a Painter doth when he
paints; but all men cannot ſet themſelves to this
manner of working, although it is very much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of, for many reaſons which hereafter ſhall
be alledged.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52916:28"/>
To work upon the ſaid ſoft varniſh, you muſt
handſomely place your board upon a desk, and
then lay a leaf of brown or white paper upon it;
ſo as it be fine and ſmooth it imports not much:
Lay then your plate upon it. Afterwards take a
linnen cloth without any kind of Seam, which
hath been often put to other uſes, to the end it
may be the more gentle and ſoft. Then double it
three or four times in folds, and lay it upon your
varniſh; whereon reſt your hand, as you uſe in
like manner ſheets of paper upon hard varniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
And the reaſon wherefore this caution is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by you, is, leſt the buttons of your ſleeve
ſhould rub off the varniſh.</p>
               <p>Be very carefull, that there be no duſt or filth
found upon your varniſh; if you chance to
ſpie any upon your plate, wipe it lightly off with
one of your large ſoft pencills, conſidering
that there is much more care to be had for the
preſerving of ſoft varniſh then of hard; and that
was the cauſe which made the Author to leave it
off, eſpecially in pieces that required long time
and much pains, it being much more eaſie to make
a firm winding-ſtroke upon hard varniſh then upon
ſoft; for as much as the hardneſſe of the varniſh
holds your point as it were engaged, which makes
the ſtrokes to be the deeper, and better, imitating
the firmneſſe and neatneſſe of the ſtrokes of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Moreover, when you are at work in ſoft var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
you muſt have a ſpeciall care, leſt any other
perſon then a practitioner of your Art, touch or
intermeddle with your plate; and if any kind of
greaſie matter happen to drop upon it, your plate
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52916:29"/>
will be incurable: but if it ſhould chance to fall
upon hard varniſh, you may then make it clean
with a linnen cloth, or crumms of bread.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that work upon ſoft varniſh, if they put
their plate on a desk or eaſle, they are not in ſo
much danger of rubbing off their varniſh, nor do
they need ſo often to wipe away that which comes
off in working; for as much as the plate being
placed obliquely, the ſuperfluous matter falls away
of it ſelf. I have not thought fit to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of it, ſince it is not likely that any of
thoſe who intend to etch after this manner, can
be ignorant how a Painter works upon an eaſle, there
being no other difference but onely this, that a
Painter uſeth a pencill, and a Graver his etching-tools.
The truth is, that the Artiſt ought to reſt
his plate very firm, eſpecially when he is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon the making of any exact ſtrokes.</p>
               <p>

manner, but it was to the end that his health

would be hurtfull to him.</p>

               <head>Sect. 21. How to border your plate, that it may contain
your Aqua fortis.</head>
               <p>GEt ſoft wax, either red or green; if it be in
Winter, ſoften it at the fire; in Summer it wil be
ſufficiently ſoft of it ſelf: In the managing of it, put
it round the brims of your plate, raiſed about half
a quarter of an inch from the ſurface of the plate,
being as it were a little rampart; in ſuch ſort, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52916:29"/>
that placing your plate very levell, and afterwards
pouring your <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> upon it, the water may
be retain'd by the means of this border of wax,
ſo as, that the water may be equally diffuſed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
but before you pour it on (to prevent its ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
through between the wax and the plate) if
need require, heat a little piece of Iron, and run
it over on the out ſide where the plate cloſeth with
the border.</p>
               <p>Having thus bordered your plate, take common
<hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> ſuch as is uſed by the Refiners, pure
and good, and mingle it with common water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in quantity about the third part of your <hi>Aqua
fortis;</hi> or if you have <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> of which you
have made former uſe in etching, mingle it with
the pure <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> in ſtead of common water, and
let the quantity be proportionable to the ſtrength
of it; then pour it gently upon the plate, in ſuch
ſort as that it may remain upon it the thickneſſe of
half a fingers breadth all over: if you make uſe of
the ſtrongeſt <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> be carefull to mingle it
with the greater quantity of common water.</p>
               <p>Then you ſhall ſee that the water will work and
bubble up in thoſe ſtronger hatchings that are moſt
firmly ſtricken; as for thoſe that are fainter you
ſhall perceive them clear at firſt, and of the colour
of the copper, the water not making on a ſudden
any other operation than appears to view.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, when you ſhall have perceived the
water to operate a ſmall time, pour it off from the
plate into ſome veſſell which is moſt proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, as into an earthen diſh well varniſht, or the
like, then throw ſome fair water upon the plete, to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52916:30"/>
extinguiſh and waſh away the remainder of the <hi>Aqua
fortis,</hi> which was upon the plate, then dry it by the
fire, as you have been taught before, when we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſt

varniſh and <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> of the Refiners, be carefull
in eſpeciall manner to cauſe to evaporate that
moiſture, which in the Winter time is commonly
between the copper and the varniſh, before you
lay on your <hi>Aqua fortis:</hi> The ſuperfluous moiſture
being evaporated from it, take your mixture of
oyl and greaſe, as is before mentioned in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this diſcourſe of hard varniſh, and
therewith cover thoſe places which ought to be moſt
tender and ſweet; and having covered them the
firſt time, lay on again upon your plate the ſame
<hi>Aqua fortis</hi> which you had taken away, and leave it
on for one half quarter of an hour, or a longer
time, according to your diſcretion; then take off
the <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and cover with your mixture thoſe
next places, as you ſhall ſee occaſion: And as you
would have your lines or ſtrokes to be deeper and
deeper, ſo cover the ſweeter part by degrees with
your mixture, that the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> may ly the
longer on the deeper ſtrokes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, lay on yet again the aforeſaid <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
and leave it on for the ſpace of half an hour,
either more or leſſe according to the ſtrength of the
water and nature of the work, then take it away
and caſt ſome fair water upon the plate again.</p>
               <p>That being done, take off your border of wax,
then heat your plate, ſo that the oyly mixture and
the varniſh may throughly melt; then wipe it well
with a linnen cloth, afterwards rub it all over with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52916:30"/>
oyl-Olive, with a piece of old beaver roll'd up, and
that being done, touch it over again with your
graver in thoſe places where it ſhall be needfull.</p>
               <p>One thing I ſhall advertiſe you of, which is, that
while the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is upon your plate, you take
a feather and dip it to the bottome of the ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua fortis,</hi>
ſweeping it along to remove the froth or
ſcum which gathers upon your ſtrokes or hatchings,
while the water makes its operation; as alſo to
give the more way to the operation of the water,
and to ſee if the varniſh be not broke up, which
the bubling of the water hinders you from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning.</p>
               <p>You may alſo take notice that the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> of
the hard varniſh, will ſerve excellently well to eat
into the work made by the aforeſaid ſoft varniſh,
and that the manner of applying the oyly mixture,
is all one with that of hard varniſh, and who ever
uſeth it may be aſſur'd, that it is much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for this purpoſe than that of the Refiners;
Moreover, it is not ſo ſubject to cauſe the varniſh
to break up, nor to many other accidents, as the
being hurtfull to the ſight, or to ones health, as
that of the Refiners is, nevertheleſſe every one may
uſe which of them he pleaſeth.</p>

your hard or ſoft varniſh.</head>
               <p>THere is a way to whiten your varniſhes upon
the plate, inſtead of making them black with
a candle, which is thus.</p>
               <p>When you have apply'd your hard varniſh (as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52916:31"/>
hath been taught) upon the plate, harden it upon
the fire without blacking it, yet in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as if it were blackt, then let the plate cool; and
having gotten white Ceruſſe and put it into an
earthen diſh well leaded, with a little Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Starch in it, ſet them upon the fire and
melt them together, making them pretty hot, that
being done, take up the white Ceruſſe, which
ought to be indifferently clear, with a bruſh or
great pencill of hoggs hair, and therewith whiten
your varniſh, laying it as thin and as even as you
can, then leave it to dry, laying the plate flat in
ſome convenient place; and if by chance in white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it, the white be difficult to ſpread, you need
do no more, but put among the ſaid white<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ceruſſe
a drop or two of the gall of an Ox, and ſo min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
them together in the diſh with your bruſh.
And for the ſoft varniſh, you ſhall need onely to
do the ſame thing; after you have laid it upon the
plate and extended it very evenly with the featherd
end of your quills; Some will ſay, that if they
black it before they apply the white upon it, when
they come afterwards to grave, the hatchings will
be the more black, and by conſequence will appear
ſo much the more diſtinct to the eye. But to this I
anſwer:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That when it is blackt, the white will not
touch it, and that they muſt not venture to put ſo
much gall, for fear of ſpoiling the varniſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That if the white ſhould ſpread wel, yet
it would not appear otherwiſe then grey, by reaſon of
the blacking of the ſaid varniſh, unleſſe you ſhould
lay it ſo thick that all would be nothing worth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52916:31"/>
The marking of your deſign upon ſoft varniſh,
is performed with the duſt of red chalk (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned) ſpeaking of hard varniſh, or with
rubbing well the paper or deſign with the duſt of
black chalk or black lead, when the varniſh is made
white: for red chalk is moſt proper for a black
ground.</p>
               <p>When you ſhall have grav'd that which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon the ſoft varniſh, and that you go about
to etch your plate with <hi>Aqua fortis;</hi> that which you
have then to do, is to take a little fair water, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more than lukewarm, and to caſt it upon the
ſaid plate, and then with a ſoft clean ſpunge, or
with the fleſhy part of the end of your finger, to
rub upon the ſaid white Ceruſſe to moiſten it all
over; afterwards waſh the ſaid plate to take off the
whiting of it, and then dry it. Laſtly, you may
lay on which of the two <hi>Aqua fortiſſes</hi> you pleaſe;
and for the preſerving of the ſaid white varniſh,
while you are working, you ſhall onely need to lay
upon it a piece of ſoft linnen in ſtead of paper, or

               <p>If you ſhall chooſe rather to take away the ſaid

take gum-water, and pour a ſmall quantity upon

large pencill of hoggs hair or the like, provided
it be not too ſtiff, with that pencill take it off the
ſtone, and ſpread it thin all over your plate; and
immediate after, take a larger pencill made of
long and very ſoft hair, either of a Foxes tail, or
Bears hair, and with a very light and gentle hand
paſſe it all over the plate, ſo as to make it ly exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

that it may ly very even, and let it dry.</p>
               <p>By the way it will be neceſſary to give you this
advertiſement, that you are not to mix too much
gum with the white, nor too little; for if there
be too much it will break and crack the varniſh, if
there be too little it will eaſily rub off: therefore
you muſt be carefull to uſe neither more nor leſſe

take your plate and rub it over well with oyl-O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,

               <p>Then heat it upon a char-cole fire, and ſpread

care of is, that the hatchings, which you

you intend to coppy a printed picture, and that
you would have it to print off the ſame way when
it is graved, with your pattern; then you muſt
place your picture which you would grave, with the
face or printed ſide next to your plate, waxed over

               <p>THe upper part of this figure will ſhew two ſorts
of Graving-tools, the one formed ſquare, the
other lozeng: the ſquare Graver makes a broad
and ſhallow ſtroak, or hatch; and the lozeng makes
a deep and narrower ſtroke. The uſe of the ſquare
Graver is to make the largeſt ſtrokes, and the uſe of
the other is to make the ſtrokes more delicate and
lively. But I preferre a Graver made of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſize betwixt both theſe two; which will make
your ſtrokes, or hatches, ſhow with more life and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour;
and yet with ſufficient force, according as
you ſhall manage it in your working: The forms
of which will appear in the I. and II. figures.</p>
               <p>The III. figure ſhews you how to whet the two
ſides of your Graver, which is to be done in this
manner following; you muſt have a very good oyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
ſmooth and flat, and having powred a little
Sallad oyl thereupon, take the Graver, and laying
one ſide of it (that which you intend ſhall cut the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52916:36"/>
copper) flat upon the ſtone, whet that ſide very flat
and even; and to that purpoſe have an eſpeciall
care to carry your hand ſtedfaſt, and with an equall
ſtrength, pracing your forefinger very firm upon
the oppoſite ſide of your Graver; to the end that
you may guide it with the more exactneſſe: then
turn the very next ſide of your Graver, and whet
that in the like manner, as you did the other; ſo
that there may be a very ſharp edge for the ſpace of
an inch or better; then turning uppermoſt that
edge which you have ſo whetted, and ſetting the
end of your Graver obliquely upon the ſtone, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
your hand exactly even, to the end that it may
be whetted very flat and ſloping, in the form of a
lozeng, making to the edge a ſharp point, as the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
IIII. ſhews you.</p>
               <p>It is very neceſſary that you take great care in
the exact whetting of your Graver; for it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that you ſhould ever work with that neatneſſe
and curioſity as you deſire, if your Graver be not
very good, and rightly whetted.</p>
               <p>I cannot demonſtrate it ſo plain and fully by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
and diſcourſe, as I would: if you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance

other particulars.</head>
               <p>YOu may ſee alſo that the uppermoſt part of
this figure deſcribes to you the form of two
Gravers, with their handles fitted for the whetting.
They that uſe this Art, do before they make uſe of
them, commonly cut away that part of the knob
or bowl that is at the end of their handles, which is
upon the ſame line with the edge of their Graver;
to the end it may not obſtruct or hinder them in
their graving, as the figure II. ſhews you.</p>
               <p>For if you ſhould work upon a large plate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you
will find that part of your handle (if it be not cut
away) will reſt ſo upon the copper, that it will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſmooth and even carriage of your hand in
making your ſtrokes or hatches; alſo it will cauſe
your Graver to run into the copper in ſuch ſort,
that you ſhall not be able to manage it at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>The third figure deſcribes to you the way of
holding your Graver; which is in this manner.
You muſt place the knob or ball of the handle of
your Graver in the hollow of your hand, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
extended your forefinger towards the point of
your Graver, laying it oppoſite to the edge that
ſhould cut the copper, place your other fingers on
the ſide of your handle, and your thumb on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of the Graver, in ſuch ſort that you may
guide your Graver flat and parallel with the plate;
as you may ſee in the IIII. figure.</p>
               <p>Be carefull that your fingers do not interpoſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52916:38"/>
between the plate and the Graver, for they will be
troubleſome, and hinder you in carrying your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
level with the plate, ſo that you cannot make
your ſtrokes with that freedome and neatneſſe, as
otherwiſe you may. This I think fit to give you
notice of in this place, becauſe the skill of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Graver is that which you muſt firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
learn, and be able to practiſe without pain
or difficulty; or elſe you will not gain ſo great a
readineſſe and command of your hand, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in an accurate and skilfull Graver.</p>

and other particulars.</head>
               <p>HAving deſcribed the way of holding your
Graver, the next thing is to ſhew you how to
guide your Graver upon the plate in making of
your ſtrokes, which are ſtreight or crooked; that
you may work with the more eaſe and convenience,
you muſt have a ſtrong round leather cuſhion fill'd
with ſand or fine duſt; let it be made about half a
foot broad in the diameter, and three or four inches
deep; lay this upon a table which ſtandeth faſt and
firm; then lay your plate upon the cuſhion, as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
in the II. figure in the former Section.</p>
               <p>When you are to make any ſtraight ſtrokes, hold
your Graver as is directed in the former Section;
and if you will have your ſtrokes deeper or broader
in one place than in another, in that place where
you would have them deepeſt, you muſt preſſe your
hand hardeſt; but eſpecially in making of a ſtreight
ſtroke, be carefull to hold your plate firm and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
upon the cuſhion.</p>
               <p>And if you make any crooked or winding
ſtrokes, then hold your hand and Graver ſtedfaſt;
and as you work turn your plate againſt your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
for otherwiſe it is impoſſible for you to make
any crooked or winding ſtroke with that neatneſſe
and command, as by this means you may, if you
do not move your plate, and keep your arm and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
fixed or reſted on the table.</p>
               <p>If as you are working your Graver happen to
break often on the point, it is a ſign it is tempered
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52916:39"/>
too hard; therefore take a red hot charcole, and
lay the end of your Graver upon it, and when you
perceive your Graver to wax yellowiſh, dip it in
the water: If your Graver become blunt without
breaking, it is a ſign it is nothing worth.</p>
               <p>It will be convenient for you to have a piece of
box or hard wood, that after you have ſharpened
your Graver, by ſtriking the point of it into the
ſaid box or hard wood, you may take off all the
roughneſſe about the point, which was cauſed by
whetting it upon the oyl-ſtone. After you have gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
part of your work, it will be neceſſary to ſcrape
it with a ſharp edge of another Graver, carrying it
along even with the plate, to take off the roughneſs
of the ſtrokes; but in ſo doing take heed of making
any new ſcratches in your work.</p>
               <p>To the end you may better ſee that which is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
they commonly roll up cloſe a piece of a black
Felt or Caſtor, liquored over a little with oyl-olive,
and therewith rub the places graven: And if you
perceive any ſcratches in your plate, rub them out
with your burniſher: and if you have graved any
of your ſtrokes too deep, you make them appear
fainter with rubbing them with your burniſher.</p>
