         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That (howſoeuer the vaine inclinations of youth temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the contrary) I was euer conſcionably fearefull of trifling away all my firſt age, in the pleaſures of Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.

            <p>And I thanke God; ſomewhat hath beene already effected, which (notwithſtanding my owne perſonall vnworthineſſe) the <hi>Church</hi> hath vouchſafed with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly approbation, both to receiue at my hand, and by her reuerend Authority to deliuer ouer alſo vnto others: Whereby I haue beene encouraged, to proceed according to thoſe beginnings, and (as a teſtimony as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

hauing thus, according to your deſires, imployed my poore faculty in the ſeruice of the Church. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any vaine-glorious humour of my owne, nor by the motion of any giddy <hi>Seperatiſts,</hi> but by ſome of <hi>you,</hi> was I firſt called and encouraged to this worke.

of our Chriſtian Religion; and that each Song doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto vs, vpon ſome occaſions, in this age of the Church, as properly as it did to them, for whom they were firſt compoſed. Which in the <hi>Arguments</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, is ſo euidently and particularly declared, as I hope it will be well perceiued, it was not my owne idle fantaſie which directed me.</p>
            <p>This your RR<hi rend="sup">ces</hi> doe well know, and how the vſe of theſe <hi>Hymnes</hi> hath been continued in the Primitiue Churches; yea, and retained euen to this day in many Congregations, as not impertinent to vs of the laſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

doubt not (ſeeing the matter is of the ſame Authority) but the manner of expreſſing it ſhall make this no leſſe worthy of entertainment then that; (and though I ſhould ſay more worthy, I thinke it were no arrogance.) For (if I miſtake not) as naturally haue I expreſt the ſenſe of theſe <hi>Songs,</hi> and as plainely as moſt proſe Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue yet done. And, if any indifferent man, who knowes the <hi>Poeſie</hi> and power of the Engliſh tongue may be my Iudge; I aſſure my ſelfe, hee will cenſure the expreſſion to be ſuch, as that it ſhall neither be obſcure to the meaneſt capacities, nor contemptible to the beſt Iudgments: but becomming the purpoſe it was intended for. I haue not lept on a ſudden into this employment; but in ſtudies of this nature haue now conſumed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the yeeres of an Apprentiſhip. And if it be well weighed: Firſt, how full of ſhort ſentences and ſuddain breakings off, ſuch like ſcriptures are: Secondly, how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently theſe particles <hi>For, But,</hi> and ſuch like, which are gracefull in the Originall, will ſeeme to obſcure the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancy of ſenſe in the Engliſh phraſe, if they be not carefully needed: Thirdly, how harſh the Muſicke will be, if the Pauſes be not vſually reduced vnto the ſame place, which they haue in the firſt <hi>Stanza</hi> of each <hi>Song</hi>: Fourthly, how many other differences there muſt be betweene this kinde of Lyricall verſe and what is ſmoothed onely for the reading: Fiftly, how the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator is tyed to make choiſe, not of what is eaſieſt, but of that kind of verſe which may become beſt the nature of euery <hi>Song</hi>: Sixtly, how he is bound not onely to the Senſe, but to the very words (or words of the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) which another hath vſed: Laſtly, how beſide all this ſtrictneſſe, he is euen in conſcience alſo conſtrained, ſo to expreſſe things by circumlocution (when he ſhall be forced to it) as that, although his phraſe be of the ſame <pb facs="tcp:21591:5"/>
power, it will not be warrantable vnleſſe it be ſo alſo done, that the manner of ſpeaking, peculiar to theſe writings, may be all the way perceiued by thoſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Readers who are acquainted therewith. I ſay, If all theſe circumſtances be well conſidered (and how difficult they make it, to cloſe vp euery <hi>Stanza</hi> with a Period, or ſome ſuch point as the voyce may a while decently pauſe there) I am both perſwaded a worke of of this nature, would neither be haſtily aduentured vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againe by any other; nor my labour herein be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether diſeſteemed: who haue bin mindful of all thoſe, &amp; many other particulars, conſiderable in ſuch a buſines.</p>

For, although this Booke hath already the allowance appointed by Authority, and ſo much the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of many other good men, as that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it generally publiſhed (at leaſt) for their priuate deuotions: Yet, knowing theſe vndertakings can neuer be too perfect, I haue purpoſed this Impreſſion for no other end, but to be diſtributed among your RR<hi rend="sup">ces,</hi> and my other ſpeciall friends. That if there be any ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight committed, or ought neceſſary omitted in them; it might be reformed and ſupplied in the next Edition, by warning and inſtruction from ſome of You.</p>
            <p>But, I hope it ſhall not be found very defectiue; And <pb facs="tcp:21591:5"/>
in my Epiſtle to make anſwere vnto thoſe many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, which vulgar vnderſtandings will be apt to frame againſt this vndertaking; I thinke it alſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. Becauſe you, to whom (onely) I at this time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it, are all ſufficient enough without information from me, to perceaue how friuolous thoſe doubts and cauils be, which the weakeneſſe of ſuch are apt to inuent.</p>
            <p>And if your RR<hi rend="sup">ces</hi> be herewith ſatisfied, I value not how the wits of our age ſhall cenſure the Stile I haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; for though many of them are well acquainted with the raptures in <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> the expreſſions in <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Adonis,</hi> and with the elegancies becomming a wanton Sonnet; yet in theſe <hi>Lyricks,</hi> in the naturall ſtraine of theſe Poems, in the power of theſe voyces, and in the proprieties befitting theſe ſpirituall things, their ſenſuall capacities, are as ignorant as meere Ideots: and had it the Poeticall phraſes they fancy, I ſhould hate it; or were it ſuch as they might praiſe, I would burne it.</p>
            <p>That which I feare will be the greateſt blemiſh to this labour; is, my owne indignity. For I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I am the more vnworthy to be imployed in theſe holy things: Seeing I am none of thoſe, who are allowed to intermeddle with the Myſteries of our Chriſtian <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> Neuertheleſſe, if what I haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed be allowable in it ſelfe, and by your approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons once conſecrated to a holy Vſe, doubtleſſe (if no mans Will ſtand for a Reaſon) it ſhal be no leſſe auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then if ſome eminent <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured therein. And whenſoeuer it ſhall be againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, this I am certaine of; No man will go about it with a heart more deſirous to be rectified, or more fearefull to offend againſt the M<hi rend="sup">•tie</hi> of theſe Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21591:6"/>And I truſt no man will enuy me the honour of this employment: For, though it be no meane contentment to a Chriſtian (whoſe ſoule is touched with the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of theſe things) to be any way an inſtrument of Gods glory, yet (if we tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly conſider it) that which I haue aſpired vnto therby, makes me in regard of You, or in reſpect but of the meaneſt of thoſe who are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to adminiſter the bleſſed <hi>Sacraments,</hi> no more then a hewer of wood, or a drawer of water, for the old Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, was in compariſon of the <hi>Leuite,</hi> who offered on the golden Alter.</p>
            <p>God knowes with what minde I haue proceeded in this endeuour; and therefore Reward and Acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from aboue the Sunne I am certaine of. But the courſe of things below the Sunne, I haue ſo well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that ſhould I reach the perfection of what I went about, yet all my labour might be no to purpoſe. For as the <hi>Preacher</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.11. <hi>I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battell to the ſtrong, nor yet bread to the wiſe, nor riches to men of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, nor fauour to men of knowledge; but time and chance commeth to them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If my paines ſhall be aiudged vnneceſſary, yet my comfort is, I haue onely ſpent my owne meanes about it, and not vnder the colour or pretence of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, fedde my ſelfe fat on the patrimonies of the Church, without effecting (or ſo much as intending) any thing to her aduantage. And if it be thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; that profit ſhall be gained without hinderance to any other mans preferment. For I neuer intend (though my neceſſities were more importunate) to peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſo much as a lay-Prebend in recompence of my labours. Only your benediction, your loues, &amp; your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prayers, next vnto Gods glory, is my principall aime. <pb facs="tcp:21591:6"/>
And ſeeing neither the manner of my education, nor the courſe of my life, nor the performance of this worke (though I will not iuſtifie my ſelfe) can yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be ſuch as may diſparage the <hi>Church</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue theſe endeauours at my hands: So much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence haue I in your Fatherly diſpoſitions towards all well affected perſons, of what outward condition ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be, that I am verely perſwaded you would not for a few ouer-ſights, ſleight all my paines; but rather to the encouragement of others (for no affront in theſe ſtudies can diſhearten me) graciouſly vouchſafe in ſome meaſure to accept what I here make humble proffer of vnto your RR<hi rend="sup">ces.</hi> Which if you pleaſe to doe, I ſhall euer acknowledge my ſelfe obliged for your Chriſtian reſpect, and ſtudy ſuch things, as (perhaps) will make me hereafter more worthy of your eſteeme.</p>
            <p>So, preſuming that if I haue deliuered Reaſon, it ſhal be with your Wiſedomes, euery whit as Authenticke as if I had begun, continued, and ended this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> with the <hi>Prouerbs,</hi> or ouer-worne <hi>Sentences</hi> of olde Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: I humbly wiſh (according to the cuſtome of my Countrey on this day) a happy NEVV-YEERE to all your RR<hi rend="sup">ces,</hi> and to the whole <hi>Church,</hi> in her ſeuerall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Wherein, they glorifie the <hi>Lord</hi> for his Power, his Knowledge in warre, his Maieſtie, his incomparable Dietie, his Sanctitie, his Awfulneſſe, his Fame, his merueilous Acts, and the eternitie of his Kingdome. Moreouer, they here ſet forth the maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous violence of their aduerſaries, before their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſudaine ruine of thoſe that were deſtroyed: with the terrour, which this ouerthrow ſhould ſtrike into their ſuruiuing enemies. And laſtly, they doe at once prophecie, and pray for, the poſſeſſion of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Land, in which the holy Temple ſhould be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Song</hi> was made, and ordained by the holy Ghoſt, to be ſung, as well by euery Chriſtian Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <pb n="2" facs="tcp:21591:8"/>
as by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Iewes.</hi> For, this preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theirs, was a tipe of our deliuerance from the bondage of our Spirituall Aduerſaries. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which (in the originall tongue) ſignifieth <hi>Vengeance,</hi> (being Miſtically and anagogically conſidered) was a Tipe, both of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> a temporall aduerſarie of the Church; and of our enemie the Deuill, who purſues to ouerthrow vs in our voyage towards heauen, which was alſo in a third ſence figured by the land of <hi>Promiſe. Pharaohs hoaſt,</hi> ſignifieth all kindes of perſecutions, ſinnes, and temptations. The <hi>Red Sea,</hi> which we paſſe through, and wherein they are drowned, meaneth our <hi>Baptiſme, 1 Cor. 10.2.</hi> By <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and <hi>Canaan,</hi> which were names of the promiſed Country, before the Church was remoued thither, (and which the holy-Ghoſt here ſaith, ſhall <hi>grieue,</hi> and <hi>faint,</hi> at the newes of our regeneration) are thoſe vnderſtood, who haue falſly and wrongfully vſurped the priuiledges belonging to the faithfull congregation. By the Dukes of <hi>Edom,</hi> with the Princes of <hi>Moab,</hi> (who are ſaid to tremble at this deliuerie) all the ſeuerall powers of the kingdome of darkeneſſe are vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>Now euery good Chriſtian, may (at any time) ſing this <hi>Hymne</hi> to the praiſe of his Redeemer and in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Churches (with his owne particular) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from the ſlauerie of <hi>Sinne</hi> and the <hi>Deuill.</hi> Yea, and not vnfitly vpon ſome temporall deliuerances. But it will be indeed moſt properly vſed, both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and priuate, after the adminiſtration of <hi>Baptiſme</hi>: Seeing the paſſage through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> there, was a type of that <hi>Sacrament,</hi> according to the Interpretation of <hi>St. Paul.</hi>

Chap.</hi> of the foreſaid booke. Now, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet hauing after his <hi>Exordium,</hi> (wherein hee calleth heauen and earth to witneſſe) made a <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the Jewes peruerſeneſſe; Hee prophecieth of three principall things in this <hi>Hymne.</hi> Firſt, of their future Idolatry with their puniſhment for it.

               </p>
               <p>And in this triple-prophecie, there are alſo many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities laid downe, as conſiderable. Firſt, how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, how wiſe, how faithfull, and how iuſt God is in his owne nature. Secondly, how vnreaſonably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe his people were. Thirdly, how neuertheleſſe, God was louing, and heaped vpon them innumerable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits (ſome of which are here reckoned vp.) Fourthly, how ingratefully, and deuelliſhly they ſtill requited him. Fiftly, how he puniſhed them with grieuous plagues, but forbare a while their finall ouerthrow, to await their repentance. Sixtly, how reſpectleſſe they ſhould be of all this fauour; and what horrible inhumanities they ſhould be guiltie of. Seauenthly, how mindefull the <hi>LORD</hi> would be of their obſtinacy; how ſuddainely hee would ruine them; how ſafe they ſhould be, who profeſſed the true God, when his enemies were viſited; how vnable thoſe ſhould be to helpe them in whom they had truſted; how ſeuere, and irrecouerable the iudgement ſhould be; how certaine, in regard the <hi>LORD</hi> had ſworne it; and how all this ſhould turne to the aduantage of his Elect.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vſe</hi> which we are to make of this <hi>Song;</hi> is to repeate it often, in remembrance of Gods Iuſtice and Mercy: and to put our ſelues in minde, by the <hi>Iewes</hi> example, how ſeuerely God will puniſh ſuch as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue obſtinate in their ſinnes.

               <head>The Argument and Vſe.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the booke of <hi>Iudges, Chapter 4.</hi> you may read, that the ouerthrow giuen to <hi>Siſera</hi> (by <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi>) occaſioned this <hi>Song</hi> of deliuerance; and therefore, referring you thither to be informed concerning the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances; I will here, ſhew you the generall ſcope of this <hi>Hymne,</hi> to be a Thankeſgiuing, for a great ouerthrow, gotten on their enemies. Wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are remarkable. Firſt, in their Introduction, <pb n="16" facs="tcp:21591:15"/>
attributing the glory to God, (and inciting all Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the world to conſider it) they ſet forth with what Maieſtie the <hi>LORD</hi> came to their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Secondly, the excellency of the benefit recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, is illuſtrated, by the great deſolation they were formerly in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the little meanes they had to protect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and the happie tranquillity which they ſhould afterward enioy. Thirdly, they ſhew the cauſe of their former diſtreſſe, to haue beene Apoſtacie from God. Fourthly, they memorize thoſe, who were forward in that iuſt warre, and vpbraid ſuch as drew backe in ſo good a cauſe. Fiftly, they declare what powerfull enemies they had; and what miraculous aſſiſtance God vouchſafed. Sixtly, a curſe is denounced againſt ſuch as refuſe to fight the <hi>LORDS</hi> battailes; and She is bleſſed who was the happy Inſtrument of their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Laſtly, here is a deſcription of the manner of <hi>Siſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah's</hi> death, an Ironicall expreſſion of the Aduerſaries vaine hope of preuailing, and a propheticall imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all Gods enemies may ſo periſh, to the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church.</p>
               <p>Jt is obſerued by the <hi>Auncients;</hi> that there is no <hi>Song</hi> mentioned in the Old or New Teſtament, but it was compoſed vpon ſome extraordinary benefit or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, which the Church receiued: and that in all the ſongs of the old <hi>Teſtament</hi> (eſpecially) there is (beſide the plaine literall ſence) ſome <hi>Miſtery</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion prophetically aymed at, couertly or openly, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paſſages thereof. And therefore, this Song is not onely to be ſung of vs <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to glorifie God in memorizing his protecting our mother the <hi>Church,</hi> among the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Nation, in her Infancie: But, wee are to vſe it alſo, as a thanks-giuing for euery particular deliuerance, which is vouchſafed to the viſible <hi>Church</hi> 
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:21591:15"/>
in theſe times. As in memoriall of our miraculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, in the yeare <hi>1588.</hi> when our Princely <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi> (the Queene of this kingdome) gaue an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw to the <hi>Spaniſh Siſera</hi>: For then, the powers of heauen apparantly fought againſt him (as it is ſaid in this <hi>Song.</hi>) The Sea, more terrible then their brooke <hi>Kiſhon,</hi> ſwept moſt of them away: And euen then (as the mother of the Cananitiſh commander, is here ſcoffed at by <hi>Deborah,</hi> for her vaine expectation: So, the whore of <hi>Babilon</hi> (who was mother to that other <hi>Siſera</hi>) in vaine longed to behold him returne a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour: till being ridiculouſly confident of the ſpoile; ſhe was by the true Church laughed to ſcorne for her preſumption. And then alſo; this propheticall impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (which) we finde in the Epilogue of this <hi>Song</hi>) was partly fulfilled. <hi>Thine enemies oh LORD ſhall periſh; but they that loue thee ſhall be as the Sunne when he riſeth in his might.</hi> For, as the firſt <hi>Siſera</hi> was ſhamefully ruined by a <hi>woman</hi>: ſo, God gaue that laſt <hi>Siſera</hi> (with his ſeeming inuincible for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) into the hand of a <hi>woman,</hi> whoſe honour (with his ſhame) was thereby ſpread through as great a part of the world, as the Sunne ſhineth ouer at mid-day.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Song</hi> (as J ſaid before) would properly be ſung alſo vpon many other deliuerances which the Church hath or may haue. As for that of the <hi>powder-Treaſon</hi> and ſuch like. For were it not that J ſhould be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large in my <hi>Prologue</hi> to this <hi>Song,</hi> J could make it very probable, how the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> was ſo farre from making this <hi>Hymne</hi> to fit the <hi>Iewes</hi> after that victory onely; as that the <hi>names</hi> therein mentioned, doe well enough expreſſe any that are, or ſhall be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments againſt the peace of Gods <hi>Church,</hi> or for the protection thereof.</p>

That which is commendable in her, is two-fold: out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward induſtrie of the body; and inward vertue of the minde. Her bodily induſtry, is ſet forth in diuers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar actions, tending to the prouiding for, &amp; diſpoſing of her houſhold affaires: in which, her cheerefulneſſe, her prouidence, her courage, and her vnweariedneſſe, is alſo applauded.

The commodities ſhe her ſelfe receiueth hereby are theſe; her husband is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in her; ſhe ſhall haue comfort in her labours; her poſterity ſhall bleſſe her; her husband ſhall praiſe her aboue other women; ſhe ſhall be honoured of the beſt whilſt ſhe liues; and ſhall haue ioy after her death.</p>

for them. And therein complaineth againſt his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, becauſe, after the paines beſtowed in fencing and manuring therof (inſtead of the ſweet fruit he expected) it neuertheleſſe brought forth ſower grapes. Next, he ſummoneth their owne conſciences, (whom he had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly vpbraided) to be iudges of his great loue and their vnprofitableneſſe.

receiued notice of: it is ſaid, he repaired vnto the houſe of the LORD, and made this <hi>Prayer</hi> there.

Then, to manifeſt the neceſſitie of aſſiſtance: He vrgeth the power of that foe, ouer thoſe that ſerued not the true God. And as it ſeemes, deſireth deliuerance, not ſo much in regard of his owne ſafetie, as that the blaſphemer, (and all the world) may know the difference betweene the power of the LORD, and the arrogant braggs of Man.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Prayer</hi> may be vſed by the <hi>Church,</hi> whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer her powerfull and open aduerſarie the Turke, or any other Aduerſarie, whom God hath ſuffered to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt falſe worſhippers; ſhall thereupon growe proud, and threaten Her, alſo: as if in deſpight of God he had formerly preuailed by his owne ſtrength.

many particular circumſtances are remarkable; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Author</hi> ſheweth Gods mercy to haue beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great vnto him: Firſt, in reſpect that he ſhould elſe haue beene cut off in the beſt of his Age (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, when his ſinnes might haue made him ripe, aſwell for hell, as the graue.) Secondly, in regard he ſhould neuer haue ſeene againe the Temple of the Lord, to praiſe him there, with the reſt of his people. Thirdly, if he had beene then taken away, <hi>His dwelling,</hi> that is, his poſteritie, had beene cut off (for at that time he had no children) and ſo he had not loſt his life onely, but the hope of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> his Redeemer. Fourthly, his diſeaſe was ſo violent and vnſufferable, that he thought not to haue liued out one day. Fiftly, God deliuered him when he was not tormented in body onely, but when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered alſo extreame agonies of the Soule. Laſtly, the greatneſſe of Gods mercy is here praiſed, in that when be deliuered him from the terrors of death; he forgaue him alſo his ſinnes, which were the cauſe of that ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Then ſeeming to haue entered into a ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all this. He confeſſeth who they are, that are moſt bound to celebrate Gods praiſes; and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Deliuerance to euerlaſting memorie.</p>
               <p>By our priuate Meditations, we may vſe this for a <hi>Song</hi> of thankeſgiuing after our deliuerances from temporall ſickneſſes; which is one and the firſt ſence wherein <hi>Hezekiah</hi> vſed it.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſo good a Prince as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> would haue been ſo extreamely deiected, if he had apprehended nothing more fearefull then his preſent ſickneſſe, with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſeparation of the ſoule and body; or that it was his neuer ſeeing againe of Gods temporall houſe, that made him ſo paſſionate. For, if that had beene a matter worthy ſuch griefe, it ſhould haue beene alwayes ſo, and then neither he nor any man could haue departed this life willingly. But there was a greater miſtery in it; yea, if you well conſider that this Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance herein memorized, was confirmed by one of the greateſt miracles (to wit) the Sunne going backe ten degrees, I thinke you will then beleeue that it had reſpect to ſome greater thing then the particular reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> For that the Sunne went really backe (and did not appeare onely ſo to doe) is manifeſted in theſe places, <hi>2</hi> King. <hi>20.12. 2</hi> Chron. <hi>32.31.</hi> Jſ. <hi>39.1.</hi> for thence J gather, that it was obſerued in <hi>Aſiria,</hi> and that Meſſengers were ſent from thence to <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S <hi>Ionah</hi> fled from the preſence of the LORD, he was followed by a tempeſt, whoſe furie would not be allayed, vntil the offender was caſt into the Sea, where God had mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie on him, and ſent a Fiſh to preſerue him; Which in humane reaſon, ſeemed a more terrible dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then that he was deliuered from. But the ſafetie which at his firſt entrance, hee found in ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe a place, made him ſenſible of Gods fauour, and begat in him a firme beliefe that he ſhould be totally deliuered. And thereupon, (being yet in the Fiſhes belly) made this <hi>Prayer,</hi> to praiſe God for deliuering him in ſo great an extremity. (And he did it as ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <pb n="64" facs="tcp:21591:39"/>
of a thing already done, the better to ſhew vs the ſoundneſſe of his faith. The things remarkeable are theſe: The place where he prayed, the terrible and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auiodable danger that compaſſed him; the diſpaire he was nigh falling into, the timely application of Gods mercy, the comfort it infuſed into him, the occaſions which draw men into theſe perils, the vowe made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this deliuerance, and laſtly the reaſon of that vowe.</p>
               <p>Now, this buriall of <hi>Ionas</hi> in the fiſhes belly, and his deliuery from thence, was a ſigne of the buriall and reſurrection of our bleſſed Sauiour, <hi>Mat. 12.40.</hi> And therefore, we muſt not thinke he made this <hi>Prayer</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his owne perſon: but in the miſticall body of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> alſo. For, by contemplating the circumſtances of his danger and deliuerance, (and hauing the ſpirit of prophecie) he apprehended the miſteries of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By the <hi>ſhip</hi> ready to be ſunke, through that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt in which he was caſt away, he conceiued the wrath of God againſt the world for ſinne; and that it would not be appeaſed without ſatiſfaction.

And by the fore-ſight he had of his owne comming ſafe to the ſhore againe: he apprehended that ioyful reſurrection of our Redeemer: whoſe miſticall body (the <hi>Church</hi>) lay all that while, as it were in the very Jawes of death and hell. Theſe things <hi>Ionah</hi> apprehended through the ſpirit of prophecie, (and by the obiects aforeſaid) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this <hi>Prayer,</hi> to ſet forth the mercies of God, and to expreſſe in what a fearefull eſtate mankinde was, <pb n="65" facs="tcp:21591:39"/>
vntill <hi>Chriſt</hi> was riſen againe in victory. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, J thinke, as it will become vs Chriſtians often to ſing it in memory thereof; ſo eſpecially vpon that day which we celebrate in memoriall of our Sauiours <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>

For, the <hi>Prophet</hi> in his firſt Chapter perſonated the weake members of the <hi>Church,</hi> who were offended at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the vngodly: And hauing there brought them in, complayning, as if they feared all things would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſucceede better with their wicked oppreſſors then with them (as it did for that preſent) he in the next Chapter declared the LORDS anſwer to that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant complaint of theirs: Shewing that vndoubtedly the pride, couetouſneſſe, cruelty, drunkenneſſe, and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of (the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>) their tyrannizing enemies ſhould be puniſhed. And afterward in this <hi>Song,</hi> (which is his third Chapter) he firſt prayeth and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God for that promiſed deliuerance, ſecondly, ſetteth forth the glorious Maieſty of the Deliuerer, by excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Allegories and Alluſions to the manner of thoſe former deliuerances, which he had vouchſafed vnto the People the <hi>Iewes</hi>: And laſtly, (foretelling the miſerable and horrible deſtruction of the Aduerſary) in his owne, and in the perſon of all the Elect, reſolueth (what euer <pb n="68" facs="tcp:21591:41"/>
happens) to reioyce with confidence in the ſtrength and fauour of God.</p>
               <p>In briefe, this <hi>Song</hi> hath foure parts: In the firſt, the <hi>Sauiour</hi> is prayed for, according to the promiſe of God. Jn the ſecond, the Maieſty of his comming is deſcribed. Jn the third, his victory, with the ruine of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is declared. And fourthly, the ioy and confidence of the Church is foretold.</p>
               <p>True it is, that by reaſon of the many deepe <hi>Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> herein contained; this <hi>Song</hi> is to many very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure: Inſomuch, that the latter Hebrew <hi>Rabbins,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it one of the moſt difficult places of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And ſo ſhall we Chriſtians find it; yea, and little pertinent to vs alſo, if we looke thereon with their blinde eyes, who could ſee no farther then the letter. For they either thought this Prophecy had no further rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then to the temporall deliuery of the <hi>Iewes</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> many ages paſt: or elſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined (as ſome a little infected with <hi>Iudaiſme</hi> at this day teach) that it had reſpect to a carnall and temporall reſtoring of that Nation, now in theſe laſt ages of the World. Whereas, it hath indeede a more principall aime. For though it ſhall not be denied, that it had ſomewhat a reſpect to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deliuerance from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> ſeruitude: yet, if they ſhould be vrged to ſhew vs, how according to their meere litterall ſence, he that diliuered them may be ſaid to come from <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and Mount <hi>Paran</hi>: how that maieſty expreſſed here may be applyed to him; what plagues and fire went before him; how he ſtood and meaſured the earth; where mountaines trembled and were remoued; how the Sun and Moone ſtood ſtill, &amp;c. I am perſwaded it would trouble their beſt Expoſitor. But if we will vnderſtand it to haue principall reſpect (as in truth it hath) to the <pb n="69" facs="tcp:21591:41"/>
                  <hi>Churches</hi> deliuerance from the ſpirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi> from the ſlauery of the Diuell, and the rage of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt;</hi> by the firſt and ſecond comming of our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi>: it will then be eaſie, through the helpe of Gods holy Spirit, to ſhew you that theſe <hi>Allegories</hi> and Aenigmaticall expreſſions, which are ſo hard to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and ſome miſbeleeuers, are plainely vnridled to vs, who beleeue Redemption by the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Song</hi> is to be ſung hiſtorically, in memory of our deliuerance by the firſt comming of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and prophetically for a comfortable remembrance of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect deliuery aſſured vs at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
