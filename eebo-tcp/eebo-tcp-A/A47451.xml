            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
were wrote by
a Gentleman Residing
at <hi>Padua,</hi> upon some Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
he receiv'd there of one
<hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> a very Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Critick in the World.
The Author wrote 'em to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
his Spleen, after having
had a taste of those Criticisms.
He was so kind, as to send
them to me, to make me some
small amends for his absence.
The Freedom that is between
<pb facs="tcp:98244:3"/>
us, suffers me to let them go
out of my Hands in the Dress
that I receiv'd 'em; with a
design to try whether other
People may have the same
Opinion of him that I have.</p>

               <hi>Charon</hi> and <hi>Lycophron.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycophron.</speaker>
               <p>WHY, <hi>Charon,</hi>
what did you
bring hither last
Week?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Charon.</speaker>
               <p>Ay what indeed! I am
like to lose my place for it. I hear there
is such a stir among the Criticks, that
the three Judges have much adoe to
ratifie Bonds of Arbitration between
'em. But pray tell me what I have
done, for I am ignorant of my own
Crime.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycophron.</speaker>
               <p>Why you brought over
young <hi>Schrevelius,</hi> and he had with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98244:5"/>
him the Works of the Snarling Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<hi>Bentivoglio.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Charon.</speaker>
               <p>I can't tell whose Works
they were, but I am sure they were
confounded heavy. They had like
to have sunk my Skuller—But I
hope the Troubles are compos'd on
this side the Water.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycophron.</speaker>
               <p>No, worse than ever;
it is a Mercy that no Blood can be
spilt among them; and having no
Weapons they can't come to Daggers
drawing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Charon.</speaker>
               <p>Pray what may be the
reasons of their Dissentions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycophron.</speaker>
               <p>Why some are of your
Opinion, that indeed <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> is a
Heavy Writer; and say further, That
he is too Bulky, and too Tedious, that
he argues upon Trifles only with great
Gravity, and manages Serious Things
with as much Lightness. That he
has pillag'd Authors to gain a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but has so manag'd his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
that he has lost his end. In
short, there are mighty Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whether he has least <hi>Wit, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or <hi>Good-manners; Rhadamanthus</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98244:5"/>
is their Umpire, who finding the case
difficult, has taken a considerable
time to deliberate concerning it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Charon.</speaker>
               <p>But pray, Sir, what do you
say as to this Affair?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycophron.</speaker>
               <p>Why indeed I am not
wholly Impartial in this matter, for
<hi>Bentivoglio</hi> has very much oblig'd me
throughout his Works. He has imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
me even without reason, for as
it was my choice, so his natural Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
leads him to be unintelligible. A
Man may as soon understand <hi>his</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
as <hi>his</hi> English, and <hi>his</hi> English as
<hi>my</hi> Greek; <hi>his</hi> Prose is as Fantastick as
<hi>my</hi> Verse; and <hi>my</hi> Prophecies carry more
light with 'em than <hi>his</hi> demonstrations</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Charon.</speaker>
               <p>Why then he may have
more Worth and Learning in him
than the generality of Mortals can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
comprehend.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycophron.</speaker>
               <p>That is possible, but it
is harder to search for 'em than to dig
in the Mines of <hi>Potosi.</hi> The Great
<hi>Dionysius</hi> has found his worth; I mean
the same <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who from being Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

the thing may be, I have a
<hi>Doctor</hi> to stand by me. And then,
Sir, I shall endeavour to pacifie you
with Reasons, if that will do it; my
Arguments are from the <hi>uncertainty of
the Time</hi> in which you liv'd, and
consequently of such <hi>Persons</hi> who
might be <hi>your Cotemporaries,</hi> because
you know there could never have
been two of the same Name. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Argument I draw from the
Names of <hi>Sicilian Towns</hi> and <hi>Villages;</hi>
which amongst the variety of little
Common-wealths, and Changes of
Principalities must needs be the most
certain Rule imaginable to judge of
time by, because we know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Nations are in dispute concerning
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98244:10"/>

                  <hi>Yes, Sir, I shall throw you
in one Argument more that must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
you. Throughout all your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,</hi>
There is not one word relating
to the Old Gentlewoman, your Mother,
which a Man of your Benevolence and
Affection to your Family,<note place="margin">Dis. 520.</note> could hardly
have omitted; and in your Letters to
your Son, there is no mention made either
of the young Man's Duty to his Grand-Mother,
or of her Love to him, and in
your Letters to your Wife there is as great
a silence about the Mother's kindness to
her Daughter-in-law. <hi>Besides,</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all the Ancients us'd to date their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
yours are without any Note, Place,

tell you one thing, which I did, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98244:13"/>
I must own my Thanks to <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi>
is by him Recorded to Posterity. I
had a mind to go to <hi>Erythraea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dis. p. 114, 115, 116.</note> an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland
in the Western Ocean, and how
do you think I got thither? In a
Ship, you will say; No! in a <hi>Brazen
Ship?</hi> No, In <hi>a Cauldron?</hi> No! In a
<hi>Brazen Cauldron?</hi> No! In a <hi>Golden
Bed?</hi> No! How then, you will say
in the Name of Wonder? Why, in
short, <hi>I got the Sun to lend me his Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Cup to sail in,</hi> and I scudded away
as well as if I had had all the Wind
and Sail imginable.</p>

               <p>And no such great matter
at last! I remember as I was boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one day of my Exploits to a good
jolly <hi>Muscovite</hi> at the <hi>Bear-Garden,</hi> he
told me that St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> came to their
Country sailing upon a Mill-Stone,
which I thought as humoursome a
Passage as your Cup. But to be short
and plain with you, I have Witnesses
both on this side and t'other side of
<hi>Styx,</hi> that saw me Row my self from
the Horse-Ferry to the other side of
the Water in my own Tray, with a
couple of Trenchers; and there is a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98244:13"/>
                  <hi>Tray</hi> and a <hi>Mill Stone</hi> for your <hi>Cup</hi>

Negligence of our Ballad-Singers that
makes us be talk'd of less than others,
for who almost, besides St. <hi>George,</hi>
King <hi>Arthur, Bevis, Guy,</hi> and <hi>Hicka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift,</hi>

               <p>I thought Dictionaries

nothing else but the several parts
of a Camel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the words that are
properly us'd in the Dressing and
Equipping of it. Do you think it

just as they are in the Alphabet, and
in some measure, more properly: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they contain Words, but then
the joyning them is the Art our Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries

suppose I was to discourse in Politicks,
my first word I find in your 119th

               <p>Having an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98244:19"/>
I had spread before me the Works of

            <sp>
               <speaker>Calphurnia.</speaker>
               <p>I was so Visited in a
Morning by the Virtuosi, Criticks,
Poets, Booksellers, so taken up with
my Correspondence with the Learned
both at Home and Abroad, that I had
little time to talk with my Milliner,
Dresser, Mantua-Maker, and such Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate

               <speaker>Bellamira.</speaker>
               <p>Such a Levee for a Lady

               <p>Oh infinitely! The

that you had understood Latin and

               <speaker>Calphurnia.</speaker>
               <p>Why you, Madam, were
a Person very Nice and Exact in your
Dress, your Table and Apartments.
I have heard him, Madam, give such
a Description of a Commode from a
Satyr of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> that your Ladyship
could not have found fault with the
Air of it. Then he illustrated the
Text with the Comments of <hi>Lubin,
Holyday,</hi> and others, to that degree,
Madam, <hi>Compagibus altis aedificare Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put;</hi>
Madam! Oh charming! beyond

               <speaker>Bellamira.</speaker>
               <p>You are obliging to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

            <sp>
               <speaker>Calphurnia.</speaker>
               <p>A Gentleman came one
Morning with several various read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
upon <hi>Vitruvius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and from thence
perswaded me that the Frame of my
Looking-Glass was the most injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Piece of Architecture that could
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98244:20"/>
be, that the Bases were Dorick, the
Capitals Corinthian, and the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trave
perfectly Barbarous, for which
reason I went abroad without
Patches, till such Absurdities were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
Mended and Corrected by his
Direction.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bellamira.</speaker>
               <p>I remember in <hi>Don
Quixote,</hi> one of my Authors, the
Marquiss of <hi>Mantua,</hi> when he had
sworn to revenge the Death of his
Nephew <hi>Valdovinos,</hi> was not to Eat
on a Table-cloth till he had perform'd
it. But was not yours too severe a
Mortification for the Ignorance of
your Cabinet-maker? But, Pray, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
who was this knowing Person?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Calphurnia.</speaker>
               <p>It was the same great
<hi>Virtuoso</hi> Signior <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the most known Merit then
Breathing. I did nothing in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
without his direction. He has
often taken his Bill of Fare out of
<hi>Athenaeus,</hi> and cover'd my Table with
the most surprizing Dishes imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Ordinary Persons content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with modern Soupes, but after
my acquaintance with him, nothing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98244:21"/>
but the Black <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Broth
might be set before us.<note place="margin">p. 377, 379.</note> He gave the
bravest sounding Greek Names from
<hi>Simon</hi>'s Art of Cookery, and the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomia,</hi>
such <hi>Oulions, Groulions,
Floios</hi> and <hi>Toios,</hi> to the end of every
thing, that it was most charming.
He made the most delicious <hi>Alphiton</hi>
of the Ancients,<note place="margin">379.</note> far exceeding our
Hasty-Pudding. I remember once at
the sight of a Piece of Roast-Beef he
repeated such a rumbling description
out of <hi>Homer</hi> of the Beef sent up to
<hi>Agamemnon,</hi> that I profess my Lady
<hi>Cornelia</hi>'s Children ran away fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
long before the <hi>Melimela</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
Aurea,</hi> which the Ignorant call the
Desert, could possibly be set upon the
Table.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bellamira.</speaker>
               <p>I profess, Madam, I
had rather have gone without a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
nay, a second Course, than have
had things with such Hidious Names
set before me. But, Madam, do
Learned Men trouble themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
such Affairs as these are?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Calphurnia.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! Madam, <hi>No Man
can be a Scholar without being Expert in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98244:21"/>
the whole method of</hi> Athenaeus<hi>'s Cookery.</hi>
What Quarrels, Madam, do you
think there have been between Grave
and Learned Men, about spelling a
Greek Word, that has been only one
single Ingredient of a Patty-pan.
Pray read <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> Madam, and
you will be convinc'd of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bellamira.</speaker>
               <p>Sure, Learned Men
won't quarrel about Trifles?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Calphurnia.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! Madam, rather
than any thing. Why as I have
read in several Authors, <hi>Timothias,</hi> a
Grammarian, upon a Dispute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Greek <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
to a Chechine, with the great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Philelphus.</hi> The old Gentleman
lost, and his Adversary was so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful
as to cut it off, and hang it
upon his Chair, as a Monument of
his Victory.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bellamira.</speaker>
               <p>A Cruelty in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
too insulting.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Calphurnia.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! Madam, I had
forgot one thing, I most heartily beg
your Pardon. <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> one day
show'd me the Name of a Pudding
in one of <hi>Aristophanes</hi> his Plays;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98244:22"/>
which, if it were wrote at its full
length, would be as long as your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyship's
Tippet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bellamira.</speaker>
               <p>I fancy this Outlandish
way of furnishing your Table, was
the reason why Persons of Quality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
eating with you, especialiy
having Company that discours'd so
much above 'em.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Calphurnia.</speaker>
               <p>I was so involv'd in the
Greek, that I protest, Madam, I had
entirely forgot the necessary Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
for Lemmon Cream, and Jelly of
Harts-horn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bellamira.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps, that might be
the reason you appear'd so seldom in
the <hi>Park,</hi> and were so very long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you return'd a Visit that had
been paid you.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Calphurnia.</speaker>
               <p>My Day for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
was but once a Fortnight, but
every day for the <hi>Virtuosi.</hi> But, pray,
Madam, how did you spend your
time, and fit your self for Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bellamira.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Madam, my
own Affairs took up some part of my
time; Musick and Drawing diverted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98244:22"/>
me now and then; I had sometimes
a fancy for Work, I now and then
went to see a Play, when I lik'd the
Company I went with better than
those I usually found there; I made
my self as easie as I could to my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and I have still the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to think I was not disagreeable to
them, and I did not find but if one of
us make out in Civility what we want
in Learning, but we might pass our
time well enough in the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Calphurnia.</speaker>
               <p>If you can satisfie
your self with such Trifles, I am
your Servant Madam, and Adieu.</p>

which I shall name to you, as
that Carp and Hops came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
the same Year with Heresie.
That the first Weather cock was set
upon the Tomb of <hi>Zethys</hi> and <hi>Calais,</hi>
Sons of <hi>Boreas,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonautick</hi>
Expedition. That Mrs.
<hi>Turner</hi> brought up the Fashion of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Starch. That the <hi>Sybarites</hi> first
laid Rose-Cakes and Lavender among
their Linnen. That <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> was
the Inventor of Cushions, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
before this last Century have been
improv'd into easy Chairs, by the
Metamorphosis of cast Mantuas and
Petti-coats, to the ruin of Chamber-Maids.

               <p>Now,<note place="margin">Reflections upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern Learning. p. 58.</note> I suppose it will
be granted that if a <hi>Stranger</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Language of a Native bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to be prefer'd to him. Now I dare
confidently affirm, That the Scholars

Proofs how well they understood the

               <p>Impossible, when instead

but Huge Walnut, Chesnut,

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98244:35"/>
in their Orchards, as high as their
Garret Windows. But to return to
<hi>Tobacco,</hi> their want of that spoilt all
their Wit, Judgment, and Industry;
for Consequently they could have no
<hi>Tobacco-Boxes, Tobacco-Stoppers,</hi> or
<hi>Snuff-Boxes;</hi> all which are the Tests,
and Indications of a Mans Genius. A

shows a Gentleman of good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that would avoid smoaking for

of Complaisance does it to oblige the
Persons he Converses with. So as to
<hi>Stoppers,</hi> if made of the <hi>Royal-Oke,</hi>
it shows <hi>Loyalty; Glastenbury-Thorn,
Zeal extraordinary: a Piece of Pipe,
Humility: Silver, Pride; Black-thorn,
Adversity:</hi> And the use of <hi>the little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
if the Pipe be well lightn'd, <hi>great
Patience. Snuff-Boxes,</hi> were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
wanting to the Ancients so
that I cannot imagine how they

                  <hi>You know, Brother, I
can't deny you any thing. Sir, The
case was this,</hi> Callimachus <hi>made an
Epigram,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 59.</note> as it was supposed upon a
<hi>Shipwrack.</hi> The Learned Madam <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier</hi>
was betray'd into this mistake, <hi>by the
Greek Word</hi> Epelthon, and so was the
Critick Bentivoglio, <hi>till at last, by the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98244:39"/>
Sagacity of his Parts, and the Strength
of his Genius, he found out, that</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limachus
<hi>did not write upon a</hi> Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,
<hi>but a</hi> Saltcellar, <hi>and that</hi>
Eudemus must not be suppos'd to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from storms at Sea, but that ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great many Debts, he paid them off,
by living sparingly upon Bread and Salt.
The Diet of Poor People, and in Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it, he Dedicated his <hi>Saltcellar</hi> to
the <hi>Samothracian</hi> Gods: The Epigram,
he says, is very ingenious, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
lies in the double meaning, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of some Greeks Words, and the
Whole is a <hi>Parodia.</hi> If you please,
you shall have a Translation as I have
made of it.</p>
               <l>" <hi>Eudemus,</hi> eating little Salt, set free</l>

               <p>I suppose <hi>Eudemus</hi> was a

the Word <hi>Feller,</hi> rather than <hi>Fellow,</hi> out
of choice, and not because the Rhime

               <p>Well, if we were not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity

               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>It is wonderful to think,<note place="margin">Puppet-Shows. Dissert. <hi>p. 309.</hi>
                     </note> that we
should have so little an account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

concerning these little Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines
which approach Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

the Good-man and Dame of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
sometimes it entred into Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of State, and sung of King <hi>Henry</hi>
and the <hi>Miller;</hi> the Amours of King
<hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Jane Shore;</hi> together
with her Misfortunes;<note place="margin">Athen.</note> sometimes it
spake of Heroick Actions, as <hi>Chivy-Chase,</hi>
and the <hi>London Prentice.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Swid.</note> It
generally concluded with the praise
of Hospitality, and good House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping,<note place="margin">Schol. Ars.</note>
and presenting one Bowl of
Liquor in hopes of having it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish'd
with another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:98244:43"/>
It was sung by one Voice, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
reliev'd by a second, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
Persons of less Skill were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
so to joyn as to fill up the <hi>Chorus,</hi>
the <hi>Ode</hi> began at the <hi>Vestibule,</hi> or
<hi>Porch</hi> of each considerable <hi>Farmer</hi> in
the Parish, and the <hi>Epilogue</hi> was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
perfom'd with <hi>Minc'd-Pyes,</hi>
and <hi>Roast-Beef,</hi> in the Hall of the
same Mansion.<note place="margin">Rym.</note> Afterwards when
the <hi>Parish-Clerks</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> had for
a great while together Acted several
Interludes, the <hi>Clerks</hi> and <hi>Sextons</hi> of
the Villages thought themselves not
to be out-done in Ingenuity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reviv'd that Diversion of <hi>Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi>
the Original of which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
at least, must be search'd for in
<hi>Germany,</hi> where it continues in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
These appear'd with Masks
and unusual Habits, least otherwise
the meaness of their Persons might
take away from the Character of
those they represented. The Actors
seldom more than Three; they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
went first to the Lord of the
Mannor, their place of Action in the
Parlour, and their Reward usually
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98244:43"/>
enlarg'd with <hi>Plumb-Porridge</hi> and
<hi>Cold Pudding.</hi> Another sort of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
is the Acting of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> its
Antiquity is obscure, it is an <hi>Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore
Drama,</hi> the number of its Actors
uncertain, they generally consist of
the Children, Servants, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of a Family, and their reward
<hi>good Cheer</hi> in general. There are
very few of these, if any of the
two latter committed to Writing.
The two former seem'd to have a
stated time, as <hi>Christmas</hi> for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
the latter to have been
occasional, as Wit and good Humour
offer'd. The <hi>Whitsun-Ale</hi> seems to
have been of the next Age to the
<hi>Wassail.</hi> The Lord and Lady,
their Hall, their Hospitality of Cakes
and Ale, their Son, their Pages, their
Organs, added extremely to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of their performance. Their
place of Action generally some Barn
or Out-House, for the Conveniency
of Reception, not but that the whole
Company go round to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Gentry, where the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98244:44"/>
besides the Moris-dancing, seems
to be <hi>Mono-Prosope,</hi> the whole lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Lords Son, who raises Mirth by
<hi>Proverbs, Riddles, Comick</hi> and <hi>Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Expressions,</hi> not without the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of his Parents and their Pages.
The Reward is generally <hi>Cool Ale,</hi>
with <hi>Borrage</hi> and <hi>Sugar, Gammon</hi> of
<hi>Bacon,</hi> and <hi>New Cheese-Cakes.</hi> But to
come to the more perfect Art of the
Stage. Our Ancestors knowing
what they were wanting in, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
contriv'd their <hi>Drama,</hi> so as
to have least need of Decoration; of
this sort is Gammer <hi>Gurton</hi>'s Needle,
where the Whole <hi>Epitrope,</hi> or turn
of Affairs, depending upon <hi>Hodges</hi>'s
being prick'd with the Needle
in his Leathern Breeches, saves the
trouble of costly Scenes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines;
<hi>Grim</hi> the Collier of <hi>Croyden,</hi>
though of latter Date, yet had the
same Advantage, and consequently
both were Acted in any place as
there was occasion. <hi>Crispin</hi> and
<hi>Crispianus</hi> cost some more trouble,
the Princes could ever borrow their
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98244:44"/>
Tools from any Journey-Man Shoo-Maker,
but then the Robes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations
of the Queens and Nobles,
were forc'd to be carry'd up &amp; down
in Knapsacks. Notwithstanding the
Stage had been setled for many Years,
yet the Art of stroaling did, and
will still continue: Nor has <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spear</hi>
thought it unfit to introduce
'em as a Beauty in his Play of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</hi>
Nay, in these latter times the
<hi>New-Market</hi> Company has diverted
Corporation after Corporation, and
for the use of the Town-Hall, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Mayor, his Lady and Off-spring
in the side Boxes for Nothing.
<hi>Bateman</hi> has not disdain'd to go from
<hi>Smithfield</hi> to <hi>Southwark,</hi> and often
down to <hi>Sturbridge.</hi> Nay, Greater
Persons have from the Glories of the
Theatre, retir'd into the Country,
where the Kings of <hi>Brenford</hi> have
been forc'd in the Rehearsal to come in
the common way, for want of Clouds
to come down withal, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Othello,</hi> together with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Brabantio,</hi> in a Callico Night-Gown,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98244:45"/>
have pleaded their Cause
before a <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate, Assembled
in a place little bigger then a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
Chimney. I have shown you my
Draught which I design to Illustrate
with the Chronology of each Play,
and an Account of such Interludes as
have been Acted upon the Stages
of Mountebanks which had infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
been lost, if they had not been
Collected into One Volume, by
the industrious Mr. <hi>Kirkman,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the middle of this last Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</p>

               <p>Well, Brother <hi>Decker,</hi>
let us remain in hopes; who knows
what time may do; as to the retriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or gaining a Reputation. You
have us'd hard Words, and they may
stir up the Spirit of some Person in
times to come, to write a Scholiast
upon you as well as <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> and
that may be a Rival to the Labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Tzetzes.</hi> Who knows but I may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98244:45"/>
have the fate of <hi>Nossis,</hi> and some
Library-keepers, among his Dust, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me out of Print, may oblige the
World with a New Edition of my
Works and discover that Wit and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legancy,
which was deny'd me by my
Cotemporaries.</p>
