            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>That His Majesty is pleaſed to condiſcend that the Church-Lands ſhall be confirmed by <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>His Royall conſent, to an Act to confirm the particular Grants already made of the Biſhops Lands, for the ſpace of 99. yeeres, together with the aboliſhing of Biſhops for the ſame terme of time; provided, that there may be an indifferent choice of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy men to be ſuperviſors in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as it ſhall be ordered and agreed on by the Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines, allowed to conſult by his Majeſties former Condeſcentions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, and the Conceſſions before aſſented to, His Majeſty again propoſeth to the Parliaments Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, <hi>That He may come up to London, to treat on what elſe may conduce to the ſettlement of His three lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and bleeding Kingdoms:</hi> But the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners are not altogether ſatisfied with this Anſwer; neither do they take it as ſatisfactory. What the iſſue of this will be, we leave to time and providence. Sir <hi>Peter Killegrew</hi> is diſspatched away from hence, to the Parliament, with his Majeſties laſt Anſwer touching Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>It is verily believed, that His Majeſty will give His Royall Word to paſſe all the Propoſitions, rather then to have the Treaty obſtructed; and the rather, becuſe He finds all the Deſigns of the Royall party to be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> as alſo the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall and, Metropolitan Deſigne in the Kingdome of

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the great differences throughout he Cities of</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Roan, <hi>and other parts adjacent within the limits and bounds of the French Territories, hath quite obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Deſign of his Majesties friends for England, and that the Egliſh quarrell is ſo great in ſeverall parts of that Kingdom, that no Integrity or Loyalty can appeare viſible to its Soveraign: And therefore ſeeing no meanes prevalent, to advance His Majeſties Cauſe, Her Majeſty deſireth, that this preſent Treaty, may be the Salve and Balſome, to cure and heal all Diſeaſes, throughout his vaſt and bleeding Nations Concluding, that ſhe doth in a deep ſenſe bewaile the ſad and inteſtine Miſeries of all His liege people whatſoever. Further deſiring, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty would be pleaſed to embrace all ſuch Counſels and Conſultations that may tend to the peace and tranquility of his three Kingdoms of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
