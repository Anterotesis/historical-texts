            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Morall, is that which pertaineth to
Manners, either</p>
            <p>1. By the instinct of Nature, as belonging to the
inwarde law written in our hearts: or</p>
            <p>2 By the instruction of discipline, as being of the
outward law pronounced by God; as that of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the seaventh day; so that it may be tearmed
Naturall, as being, not of the institution of Nature,
but of the disciplining of nature: not of Nature as
it was at the first ordained by God, but as after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by him.</p>
            <p>Morall, is not every Rule (in our sense) that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
doth informe mens manners, that after such a
manner the custome of Nature informeth them;
but the naturall information of them; namely
that which by <hi>the naturall light of vnderstanding</hi>
wee see to be good or bad; and by the naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6800:3"/>
or declining of the wil, following that light,
we affect of obhorre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob</hi> The reason of the commaundement (<hi>because
the Lord rested the seaventh day</hi>) concerneth equallie
Iewes and Gentiles; therefore the commandement
belongeth equally to them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol</hi> The Lords resting on the seaventh day, is not
the reason of the obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that followes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of Gods pleasure onely; but onely of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the day, <hi>viz:</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; namely that for that
cause it pleased him to exempt that day before any
of the other, and charge it with a commandement
of rest. So that there it is not assigned; as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the commandement, why a Sabbath should
be observed, but why that day before other was
charged with the commandement.</p>
            <p>By the naturall light of vnderstanding] not as
actuated and perfited by discourse or forraigne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
or prescription of lawes, but by the power
of nature which belongeth to vs, and is found in all
Nations. For although that radiant light which
shined in our first parents be fallen with their fall,
&amp; the beames of it be gone, yet some sparke of that
light remaineth, it is not vtterly extinguished, but
(as after the falling of the Sunne) some twilight is
left, enough to see the generalities of our duty, if
we follow it, and if we follow it not, we despise to
be directed, by that light, which is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
vs. <hi>Rom. 1.</hi>

            <p>In the Commandement of the Sabbath are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:6800:3"/>1 The admonition for the observing, <hi>Remember.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 The matter commanded. 1. Sanctification of
the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day. 2. Vacation from worke, servile worke

            <p>3 The persons: <hi>Thou,</hi> thy <hi>Sonne, Daughter, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant.</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>4 The reason: Because the Lord rested on that
day from Creating.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> That commandement is charged only with
the admonition (<hi>Remember</hi>) therefore that specially
amongst the rest the Lord would name observed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> To that commandement specially is the
admonition (<hi>Remember</hi>) annexed, either, because</p>
            <p>1 It is not meerely morall and a law of nature, as
the others are, but partly ceremoniall, as touching
the determination to a certaine day; And therefore
being not so effectually imprinted by nature in the
hearts of men, needed a speciall admonition for the
observance, least it should slipp out of mind.</p>
            <p>2 It was giuen before in the wildernesse of Sin
<hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23, 26. with the giving of Manna, and by
some neglected, whereof they are admonished by
the word <hi>Remember.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 It was not continually to bee obserued every
day as the other commandements, but after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission
of 6. dayes, the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day was to be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
to rest; which they were specially required
to remember, least their desire of lucre might cause
them to worke on that day also.</p>
            <p>4 Because it hath relation as <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the reason
of the election of that day (the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6800:4"/>
times, the times of the Creation, because even
so God wrought in 6. dayes, &amp; rested the seaventh,
which they are charged to <hi>remember</hi> and doe <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 Because although the transgression of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
were in it selfe formally, no more viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then of the rest, yet in respect of the euill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
which might follow on the ignorance of
Gods law, to the hearing whereof that day was
consecrated, it was more dangerous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> No commandement so vehemently vrged
by the Prophets, nor the transgression so greviously
rebuked as that of the Sabbath, therefore it is a
principall precept.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> It is most vehemently exacted, because the
observing of it was most neglected, not because it
was more excellent then the rest. And the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
most greivously rebuked, not because the
transgression of the commandement being <hi>absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
in it selfe considered, was more sinfull, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
considering it <hi>respectiuely</hi> in relation to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
and consequences, occasionally proceeding
of that transgression, it was more dangerous: Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
as it being the day dedicated to the exercise
of their Religion (the only day of the weeke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Iewes</hi>) both for invocation and adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of almighty God, and specially, for their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the law of God, which was that day <hi>only</hi>
read in their Synagogues; vpon the contempt of
that commandement, the ignorance of Gods law,
being the foundation of all divine Religion, must
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6800:4"/>
of necessity ensue. In which respect, the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it was more perillous amongst the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
then amongst Christians, who haue other dayes in
the weeke besides the Sabbath, both for publique
prayer, and instruction.</p>
            <p>Touching sanctifying of the Sabbath; The duty
in generall of sanctifying it, is commanded by
God: But the particular manner of sanctifying it, is
not prescribed by him, but the Church; The act is
Gods ordinance; The particular manner and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the act touching time, place, order, is the
Churches decree; The thing it selfe, or matter, is of
divine constitution, but the manner and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that sanctification were left to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Sabbath day implyeth 1. number, one of
seauen. 2. Order, the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of that number, none else:
For first, in the relating of that commandement it is
never found in the Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but
every where <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> The reason assigned for the rest on that day,
will not serue for every day of seauen, but only for
the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, namely Gods rest from the workes of
creation: as the reason assigned now for the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lords day, namely the resurrection of
Christ and the descent of the Holy Ghost, will not
fitt any other.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, If the vnderstanding of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
were, one of seauen, and not precisely
the seauenth day, then had it beene lawfull for the
<hi>Iewes</hi> to haue translated their Sabbath to any other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6800:5"/>
day of the weeke.</p>

               <p>The commandement of sanctifying the Sabbath
was not giuen from the beginning, as it seemeth,</p>
               <p>1 Because there was no remembrance that it was
obserued by any of the ancient Patriarks.</p>
               <p>2 Because where it is giuen to <hi>Moses Exod. 16.</hi> it
is spoken of as a new thinge, as the rulers comming,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6800:6"/>
and report to <hi>Moses</hi> vers. 22. and <hi>Moses</hi> answere to
them vers. 23. doe plainely declare; namely that <hi>the
morrow was the Rest of the holy Sabbath to the Lord,</hi>
whereof they could not haue beene ignorant, if it
had beene vsuall before.</p>
               <p>3 Because, it is said to be giuen to the <hi>Israelites
Exod. 16. 19.</hi> to be a signe betweene God and them
<hi>Exod. 31. 13. Ezech.</hi> 20. 12. but it was not a signe to
the <hi>Israelites</hi> more then to other Nations, if it had
beene giuen from the beginning to <hi>Adam</hi> and his
posterity.</p>
               <p>4 Because, in the beginning there was no occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in mens labour, to draw them away from the
contemplation and worship of God, but that every
day might be a Sabbath, for the state of innocency
admitted neither one nor other, but man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was most prone to the honour of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> God sanctified the seaventh day presently

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1 God sanctified it himselfe by resting in
himselfe, and producing no more creatures; but he
commanded not <hi>Adam</hi> to sanctifie it: for where it is
said that God sanctified the seaventh day, because
in it he rested from all his workes; that (because)
seemes not so much to note the occasion why hee
sanctified it, as the formall cause or condition of the
sanctification, which consisted in the rest of God in
himselfe, ceasing to worke more in the Creation
of things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 2 Or if it note the occasion (which I rather
thinke) yet it designeth not the time of the sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6800:6"/>
so that although it be said that God sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the seaventh day, because he rested in it from the
Creation (which <hi>Moses</hi> there fitly obserues, because
he writes there of that rest of God) yet it followeth
not that he sanctified it <hi>then,</hi> when hee rested, but
that for that reason hee sanctified that day rather
then any other, when he gaue the commandement
touching the Sabbath in time of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 3 Or else hee sanctified it from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by <hi>destination</hi> to sanctifie, ordayning that to be
the day which in the Law he would sanctify; But
not by <hi>Actuall explication,</hi> to sanctifie or command.</p>

So the Institution of the Lords day is not his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Hee ordained indeed by his secret decree

               <p>The Commandement of the Lords day, may be

               <p>1 Either because the Apostles established it, being

               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:6800:11"/>2 Or because they had receiued the authority

               <p>3 Or because it was dedicated or ordained to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

               <p>So that the preeept of the Lords day is in these
respects divine, but yet is not a divine Precept, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Act of commanding it; or imposing the

(at most) <hi>Apostolicall.</hi>

be humane Institution (that is) ordained of men
in zeale of Gods glory. And in the second sense,
the Lords day is iustly tearmed to be <hi>Iure divino.</hi>
The worship of God that belongeth to the Lords
day is of the Law of God and nature <hi>(Thou shalt
worship the Lord thy God)</hi> but the peculiar belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6800:12"/>
of that worship to that day, is not of those
Lawes, (that is) the worship considered in it selfe
is <hi>de iure divino;</hi> but the Annexion of it to that day
rather then any other, is but <hi>de iure humano,</hi> as
being meerely ceremoniall.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Ius divinum</hi> be that, or taken for that which is
established by divine Authority, the Lords day is
in some sort <hi>de iure divino:</hi> In some sort, namely,
not by <hi>Personall,</hi> but by <hi>delegate divine authority</hi>
(that is) not prescribed personally and immediatly
by God himselfe, but only by vertue of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which by God was committed to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
for the ordering and governing of his
Church: but being taken for divine ordinance, or
commandement, it is not <hi>de iure divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To entitle a Commandement divine is required,
1 First that the Authoritie be divine whereby it is
ordained.</p>
               <p>2 That the Author himselfe that ordaineth it, be
so also: that is, that both the power whereby, and
the Person that doth immediatly establish it, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine:
which divine authority is confessed to be in
the Apostolique Constitutions, but the immediate
Authors are denyed to be divine. Now as all other
events and Actions receiue their denomination
from their immediate not remote causes, as to bee
tearmed <hi>Necessary</hi> or <hi>Contingent, Naturall</hi> or <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
Divine or humane:</hi> so the constitutions of the
Apostles, although they proceede originally from
the instinct and inspiration of the Holy Ghost,
Gods spirit; yet proceeding immediatly from the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6800:12"/>
institution of the Apostles themselues, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
them to the Church in forme of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
they are to be termed humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
and not properly divine.</p>
               <p>Lawes may be said to be established by God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in respect of the</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Institution,</hi> when they are ordained and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by him, as that of the Lords day is not.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Approbation</hi> or <hi>Confirmation,</hi> when they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by him; and thus it may bee said to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> The decrees of the Apostles deliuered to the
Church proceed from the Holy Ghost, therefore,
they are divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> They proceede from the Holy Ghost occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
and mediatly, as disposing the mindes of
the Apostles to exact them for the good of the
Church; But Immediatly and Actually from the
Apostles. Or else, from the Holy Ghost by way
of inspiration but not by way of <hi>Iniunction</hi> or
Commandement. I say by way of Inspiration,
from the Holy Ghost illuminating the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Apostles to perceiue that such a decree
would be good for the Church: but not by way of
Injunction as charging them to impose such a
Commandement vpon the Church. So that here
was <hi>direction</hi> only without <hi>obligation,</hi> the Holy
Ghost <hi>assisting</hi> but not <hi>appointing;</hi> and therefore no
divine Commandement. For the establishing of
the commandement will no more proue a divine
Action because the Apostles receiued the light
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6800:13"/>
whereby they established it from the Holy Ghost:
then the sight <hi>of the eye an heavenly action,
because it receiueth the light whereby it sees from the
sunne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Precept of the Lords day was instilled and
inspired into the mindes of the Apostles as a thing
expedient and worthy to bee commanded, but
not as a commandement, or that ought of duty or
necessity to be commanded.</p>
               <p>The decree of the Lords day is of God, or the
spirit of God <hi>dispositiuely</hi> or <hi>directiuely,</hi> enlightn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the vnderstanding of the Apostles &amp; Church
to see that it was expedient and profitable for the
Church, but not <hi>Immediatly</hi> or <hi>Imperatiuely,</hi> by
way of Mandate or obligation, as charging
the Church to doe it, as in <hi>Act. 13. 2. Separate mee
Barnabas and Saul for the worke to which I haue
called them.</hi> So that as it proceedes from the Holy
Ghost, it is no commandement, but as from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
and Church it selfe: As when I giue a man
light whereby he may see his way, or else advise
him to take that way, I doe not therefore impose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Commandement on him to proceede that way.</p>
               <p>The Precept of the Lords day, being indeed
but an Ecclesiasticall or Apostolicall constitution,
may notwithstanding be tearmed divine.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Originally;</hi> because the Authority whereby
the Apostles established it was receiued from
God.</p>
               <p>2 Because it was destinated to the worshippe of
God: <hi>Obiectiuely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:6800:13"/>3 <hi>Materially;</hi> because it is of things belonging
to divine not humane affaires.</p>
               <p>4 <hi>Exemplarily,</hi> because it was ordained by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
or Imitation of the Sabbath, which in the old
Law was commanded by God himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob:</hi> The celebration of the Lords day was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the Church from the Commandement
of the Sabbath, therefore it is a divine decree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol:</hi> If it were deduced from it by way of <hi>Illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as conclusions are from their principles, it
were virtually or consequently a divine decree: but
it is deriued from it only by <hi>Imitation</hi> or <hi>Analogie,</hi>
or by way of <hi>Example,</hi> as from a patterne; and yet
that derivation was not caused by divine ordinance
(for there is no Commandement of God to imitate
that patterne) but by humane discourse, reasoning,
that it is convenient, that in the new Law one day
of seauen be reserued for God, because God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
so commanded in the old. And that day should
be the first of the seauen, because it was the day of
Christs resurrection, the New Law-giuer; or the
day wherein God beganne to create the world: or
the day wherein the holy Ghost descended visibly
from heauen vpon the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob:</hi> By Christs Lawes we are bound to heare
his Apostles &amp; obey them as himselfe, <hi>He that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
you heareth me:</hi> Luc. 10. 16. <hi>As my Father sent
me, so send I you, &amp;c.</hi> Ioh. 20. 21. Therefore he that
transgresseth the Apostles Commandement, doth
also transgresse the Commandement of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol:</hi> 1. The trangression of the Apostles Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6800:14"/>
is also a transgression of Christs, not
<hi>Formally</hi> and <hi>Directly,</hi> but <hi>Consequently,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitantly,</hi>
because hee hath charged to obey his
Apostles, which proueth not the Apostles decrees
to be divine Commandements, but being humane
Commandements, to be warranted and approued
by divine authority.</p>
               <p>2 The Apostles constitutions may bee tearmed
divine Commandements, not in respect of their
<hi>Institution,</hi> which is humane, as being the Act of
humane will, and discourse, but in respect of their
<hi>Obligation,</hi> because wee are by Christs Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
charged and bound to obey them.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>(He that heareth you heareth me, &amp;c.)</hi> is
not to be vnderstood properly, as of the <hi>Personall</hi>
or <hi>Identicall</hi> hearing of Christ, but <hi>Analogically</hi> as
of Christs interpretation or estimation, of that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
or disobedience to his Apostles as perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to himselfe, and of their despising, as if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
were despised, because the honour or disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Embassadour redoundeth to him that
sent him, as in Mat. 25. 40. <hi>What yee haue done to the
least of these, yee haue done it to me,</hi> that is, in mine
acceptance and estimation. So that these and the
like speeches are to be vnderstood as of <hi>Analogie,</hi>
not of <hi>Identity.</hi>

               <p>The Apostles are considered two waies either as</p>
               <p>1 Apostles, that is, <hi>Messengers</hi> of Christ to preach
the Gospell, and the things belonging thereto: that
is, the Articles of faith, the Sacraments of Grace, &amp;
the fundamentall rules of holy life, that is, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Gods Morall Law: In which respect, all
that proceeded from them was <hi>De iure Divino;</hi>
they being but the proclaymers, or messengers to
declare Gods will vnto men: for in this respect
they receaued not only authority to teach, Mat. 28.

points which they were to teach, vers. 20.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Governours</hi> of the Church which they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to Christ by appointing, and setting downe of
Canons, and convenient rules for the good orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and discipline of the Church: in which respect
they receaued authority from Christ indeed; but
particular commandement touching the Rules, &amp;
Lawes, which they were to ordaine, they receaued
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6800:15"/>
not, seeing they no where declare, or signifie such
Canons, or Commandements to haue beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by Christ to the Church, or giuen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
for that purpose, but deliuer them as their

               <p>The Apostles Constitutions are not <hi>divine</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
               <p>1 Because the Church hath altered, and abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some of them, as 1. the salutation by kissing:</p>
               <p>2. The excluding of widowes vnder 60 yeares old,
which were after receaved by the Church at 50.
Novel: 6. Canon: 6. after that at 40. Concil: Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:
Canon. 15. 3. abstaining from things stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>2 Because the Apostles themselues intimate
sometimes so much. As, <hi>I speake this by permission,
not by Commandement.</hi> 1. Cor. 7. 6. To the rest, <hi>I
speake, not the Lord,</hi> 1. Cor. 7. 12. <hi>Other things I will
order,</hi> &amp;c. 1. Cor. 11. 34. Extreame vnction (as it is
tearmed) was an Apostolique Commandement,
Iam. 5.</p>
               <p>3 Because neither the divine Authority imparted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6800:15"/>
to them by Christ, nor the suggestion of the Holy
Ghost, is sufficient to make them divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements?
Not the Authority, <hi>because all the
power, &amp; authority of Princes, is likewise from God:
Rom. 13.</hi> yet their decrees are no divine comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.
And secondly, because Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
are declarations of Gods pleasure,
what he would haue done; therefore imparting of
Authority to giue commandements, without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
what he would haue commanded, is not
sufficient to make them Gods commandements.
Not the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, being but
by Illumination, or suggestion; 1 Because all the
good workes of men should by the same reason be
divine actions, as proceeding from the suggestion
of the Holy Ghost. 2 Because if inspirations of the
Holy Ghost be divine commandements, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that so many divine Commandements are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to men, as good workes, or wordes, or
thoughts proceed from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And withall that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
more Commandements are imposed by
God, to good, them to wicked men.</p>
               <p>4 Because Christ gaue not the Apostles alone
that power of ordayning Lawes in the Church, as
for themselues <hi>Personally,</hi> but to the Church, in
whose name, as being the first Governours of it,
they receiued it: for else it should follow, that now
the Church, since the Apostles times, is destitute
of power to make lawes: and consequently, that all
the Lawes brought into the Church by generall
Counsells are vniust, because established without
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6800:16"/>
lawfull Authority, and that many mischiefes of
heresies, and schismes, may befall the Church,
which she hath no power, or meanes to helpe. If
therefore that Authority of ordaining Lawes was
giuen by God to the Church (in whose behalfe
the Apostles receiued it) it followeth that if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
decrees be divine Commmandements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they receiued that power from God, that
all the ordinances of the Church, by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
are divine Commandements.</p>
               <p>5 Because if the Law of obseruing the Lords
day be a divine Commandement, then it is so, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because it proceeded from God immediatly,
<hi>without the intervention of man</hi> (which must bee
shewed out of the word of God) or else if it be to
be reputed a divine Commandement because it
proceeded from God <hi>Mediatly,</hi> then all humane
Lawes, that are good and just, are also divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andements.
<hi>By me Kings raigne and Princes, &amp;c.
Prov. 8. 15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 Because if the constitutions of the Apostles,
deliuered to the Church, had beene Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
imposed on the Church by them (as
the judiciall and ceremoniall precepts of the old
Lawe were by <hi>Moses</hi>) then would they haue signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
withall to the Church, that they had beene
Gods owne commandements, whereof they were
but the Messengers, or reporters (as <hi>Moses</hi> and the
Prophets vse was <hi>Thus saith the Lord</hi>) for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they should wrong both the Church, who
would haue receiued them with the more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6800:16"/>
knowing them to be Gods owne comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
and not the Apostles; and also God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
by not declaring them to the Church, to bee
Gods owne commandements, which God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as his commandements to the Church.</p>
               <p>But if it be answered, that the ordinance of the
Lords day was not an <hi>Inspiration</hi> only, but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Revelation</hi> of Gods pleasure touching it; it
may be refelled. 1 Because it is but a voluntary as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
that cannot be proved. 2 Because such a
<hi>Revelation</hi> made to the Apostles, is no divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
to oblige the Church; for if a revelation hath
the force of a divine Commandement, yet hath it
so only in relation to them, to whom it is a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not to others, except it appeare to them that
such was Gods revelation. For I aske, whether by
that Revelation, God commanded the Apostles to
ordaine such a Precept in the Church touching
that day? Or whether by it hee commanded the
Church, but revealed it to the Apostles, that they
should publish it as his commandement to the
church? If the first; it follloweth, that although
that commandement be divine in relation to the
Apostles, yet in relation from the Apostles, to the
church, it is Humane, except God had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Apostles to publish it in his owne name:
But if that Revelation was made to the Apostles,
not to the intent they should be <hi>ordainers</hi> or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
of such a commandement in the church, but
that they should be <hi>publishers</hi> of that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the church, which God had for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6800:17"/>
revealed to them in his name; then did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
sinne most grievously that published it not
in his name to the church, which they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from God, to publish as his precept: especially
seeing it could not oblige as a commandement of
God, which was not promulgated in his name, &amp;
as his commandement; therefore there was no
such revelation made to the Apostles, especially
seeing neither in the Apostles writings, nor in
those Fathers that liued with the the Apostles, or
neerest their time, or any other of all Antiquity,
there is any remembrance found of any such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
or commandement.</p>
               <p>That which the Apostle saith 1. Cor. 7. 12. <hi>(to
the rest speake I, not the Lord)</hi> he spake either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and then it
is manifest, that all Apostolique ordinances are
not divine commandements; or if by the Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Holy Ghost, then it followeth that these
inspirations are not the Lords commandements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> The Apostles were the instruments, and ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Holy Ghost, because <hi>he taught them all
things</hi> Ioh. 14. 26. <hi>he lead them into all truth</hi> Ioh:
16. 13. It was he that <hi>spake in them</hi> Mat. 10. 20.
Marc: 13. 11. Therefore their decrees are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The Consequence is denied, for teaching is a
<hi>passible act of the vnderstanding,</hi> whereby it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
to see the truth; but commanding is an
<hi>actiue operation of the will,</hi> whereby it obligeth
them to whom the commandements doe belong.
So that <hi>(to teach them all things)</hi> is, to enlighten
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6800:17"/>
their vnderstanding in all things; neither all things
absolutely (for then should they be omniscient) but
as our Saviour seemes there to declare it, by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring</hi>
them of <hi>all things</hi> he himselfe had told
them; or <hi>all things</hi> necessary to the mysterie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
to the Gospell of Reconciliation; And
so to lead them <hi>into all truth</hi> belonging to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of faith, or into <hi>all truth,</hi> necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or, to the performance of their Apostolicall
function. And so lastly was it the Holy Ghost that
<hi>spake in them,</hi> not personally, for in Luc. 12. 12. it
is declared thus <hi>the Holy Ghost shall teach you what
you ought to say.</hi> But it followeth not, because the
Holy Ghost taught the Apostles <hi>all things,</hi> or <hi>all
truth</hi> necessary for the preaching of the Gospell,
therefore he commanded all those ordinances,
touching the goverment, manners and discipline of
the Church, which by the Apostles were establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed;
Or because he directed them what was to be
beleeued touching <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>doctrine,</hi> therefore he
limited, and enioyned them what was to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
touching <hi>manners</hi> and <hi>discipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostles touching <hi>Matters of Faith,</hi> or
declaration of the Gospell to the world, were <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers</hi>
onely; and receiued not onely Authority
to preach, but particular instructions also of every
poynt they were to preach, from Christ himselfe.
But as touching <hi>Matter of Goverment,</hi> or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Discipline, to bee exercised in that
Church which they gathered out of the world,
they were more then messengers, namely <hi>deputies
or Vicars of Christ,</hi> and receiued (by delegation
from Christ) Authority, whereby they were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6800:18"/>
and enabled to order the <hi>Oeconomie</hi> of the
Church; but were not limited by personall, and
particular instructions from Christ; how euery
thing must be done, but were enlightned onely by
the Holy Ghost, to see what was most convenient
for themselues, and for the Church, and so to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it. But whatsoeuer they taught, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as Messengers of the Gospell, touching faith,
loue and the Sacraments, was <hi>de iure divino,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they commanded in that behalfe, nothing
but what Christ had commanded them to teach, or
command the Church, that is, they were but the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters</hi> of Christs commandements, and not ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of them.</p>
               <p>The old Law contained many determinations,
both in ceremoniall Praecepts, touching the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Gods worship, &amp; also in judiciall touching
Peace and Iustice to be kept amongst men: But the
new lawe (being the Lawe of Liberty) imposeth
not these determinations; but contents it selfe with
three Generall sorts of Praecepts, namely</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 The Morall commandements, that belong to
the Law of nature.</item>
                  <item>2 The Articles of Christian faith.</item>
                  <item>3 The Sacraments.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But all other matters, pertaining to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
or particular manner, either of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or humane judgements, are freely permitted
by Christ (the giuer of the new Law) to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verners
of the church, &amp; to the princes of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be appointed: so that all such particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
are but <hi>de iure humano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostles haue a twofold relation; One to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6800:18"/>
the worke of the Gospell; whereof they are the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensers,
that is, to doctrine; of which Christ being
the Author, and they only the Messengers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
that which they deliuer is <hi>de iure divino;</hi>
Another to the Church, whereof they are the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseers
and governours, that is, to order and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline:
of the particular ordinances, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of which Goverment, the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
being directly Authors (although they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the Authority whereby they were warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from God) it appeareth they are but <hi>de iure
humano.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The celebration of the Lords day had for occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
1. The resurrection of our Sauiour that day:
2 The example of his Apostles: 3 The custome
of the Church freely imitating (without Precept)
that Example, who yet solemnized it not in stead
of the old Sabbath, but together with it; as yet is
vsuall in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and <hi>Syria;</hi> And all this while
it was obserued, not of necessarie obligation, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
(for any thing that appeareth) but of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
devotion. But at last it obtained obligation
by the Institution of Princes, and Synods of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6800:19"/>
Church; The first Emperour that commanded it
was <hi>Constantine the Great, Cod. lib. 3. Tit. 12. lib. 3.</hi>
The Synode that decreed it was the Councell of
<hi>Laodicea</hi> Can. 29. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 364.</p>
               <p>The Apostles <hi>Examples</hi> of assembling to divine
service on the Lords day, enforce no <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
on the Church to doe the like (else by their
example we are also to keepe the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sabbath)
because examples haue not the force of <hi>Lawes,</hi>
which all men ought to keepe, but of <hi>Counsells</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and perswasions, not amisse to be followed of
them whose case is alike.</p>
               <p>Touching the preaching of the Gospell vnto the
world, it was necessary our Saviour should giue
his Apostles, not only authority to preach, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
commandements and Instructions, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every thing they were to preach, because their
<hi>Preaching</hi> respected the doctrine of the Church,
which is <hi>Catholique;</hi> and ought to bee the same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
and over all the world: But touching the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning</hi>
of the Church, it was convenient hee
should giue them authority, and charge to gouerne
it, but particular instructions and prescript Rules
were not so necessary, because it belonged but to
the discipline of the Church; for which, either at
all seasons, or in all parts of it, the same Rules of
Government are not convenient.</p>
               <p>1 The solemnity of the Lords day consisteth not
by any <hi>Precept</hi> of theirs (that is the Apostles) but
by their <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Or if it did as touching <hi>Sanctification</hi> by holy
assemblies, yet not touching generall <hi>Vacation</hi> from
worke, as in the old Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:6800:19"/>3 Or if both were the Apostles Precepts, yet it
followeth not they were <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements:
for although the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of the Sabbath had
beene enjoyned the Apostles by God, to bee tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
to the Lords day; yet it doth not follow,
that the <hi>old Commandement</hi> touching the Sabbath
was by Gods ordinance also translated to that day.
For if the Lords day be charged with the same
Commandement, precisely that the Sabbath was,
so that there is no other change saue of the day,
then is it no lesse displeasant to the Lord, to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
light worke on the Lords day then on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
as, to goe out of <hi>our places,</hi> Exod. 16. To <hi>kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
fire,</hi> Exod. 35. To <hi>gather stickes, &amp;c.</hi> And every
one that transgresseth it, deserueth to dye, Exod. 31
14. 15. For God is the same, who gaue all these
charges touching the Sabbath. If therefore the
Commandement be also the same, there is as much
reason for the one, as for the other.</p>
               <p>Besides the Lord loueth not one day more then
another, therefore if the duties belonging to both
dayes bee the very same, there was no reason to
transferre those duties, from one day to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob:</hi> The celebration of the Lords day hath
warrant by Scripture. 1. Cor. 16. 2. Act. 20. 7. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol:</hi> 1. Warrant of <hi>Example</hi> it hath, that it <hi>may</hi>
be done; warrant of <hi>Commandement</hi> it hath not,
that it <hi>must</hi> be done.</p>
               <p>2 There are 2 points in the celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that day,
1 <hi>Sanctification</hi> by publike devotion in solemne
assemblies, for which wee haue the Apostles <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,</hi>
but not <hi>Precept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 <hi>Vacation</hi> from worke, for which wee haue no
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6800:20"/>
evidence, either of Precept, or Practise of theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob:</hi> There cannot be so many reasons for the
celebration of any other day, as the Lords day,</p>
               <p>1. Creation of the world. 2. Nativity. 3. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of Christ. 4. Descent of the Holy
Ghost, &amp;c. Therefore the Church could not haue
dedicated another day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol:</hi> The argument is denied: because though
these are good reasons for the <hi>Election</hi> of the day,
why the Church should encline to make choice of
that day before any other, yet not sufficient for <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,</hi>
to binde them to obserue that, and exclude
all other, for the Church notwithstanding these
reasons, might haue dedicated another day to that
solemnity without breaking any Commandement
of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob:</hi> The Lords day is insteed of the Sabbath,
and equivalent vnto it, therefore the sinne is equall
in transgressing of either.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol:</hi> It is insteed of it, because it hath succeeded
it; and is equivalent vnto it, as touching the <hi>Vse,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
consecrated to the solemne worship of God and
Rest, as that was; but not equivalent, either as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the <hi>Institution,</hi> because it is ordained not by
God, but by the Church; or as touching the <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi>
because it is not charged, as that was with
Gods commandement; so that there is the like <hi>End</hi>
of both, but not the like <hi>Beginning;</hi> the like equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of <hi>Occasion</hi> for both (the Resurrection of
Christ, and the manifestation of mans redemption,
being as excellent a worke as rest from creation)
but not equivalence of <hi>Authority</hi> in establishing of
both; The like <hi>vtilitie</hi> in obseruing of it, but not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6800:20"/>
the like <hi>Necessity</hi> and obligation to obserue it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob: Esay</hi> 66. 23. speaking of the renewed state
of the Church by Christ, saith, <hi>That from moneth
to moneth, &amp; from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh should
come to worship,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore the Sabbath of
Christians is established by divine voice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol:</hi> 1. Hee speakes not onely of the <hi>Renewed</hi>
state (by Grace) but of the <hi>Glorified</hi> state of the
Church, as is manifest by the 22 and 24 vers. And
that, of their <hi>worshipping from Sabbath to Sabbath,</hi>
is not to be vnderstood <hi>Litterally,</hi> but <hi>Figuratiuely</hi>
to note not so much the manner, and intermissions,
as the everlasting continuance of that worship, by
those seasons of worship (<hi>the new Moones and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths</hi>)
that were familiar to the Iewes.</p>
               <p>2 Or if it be vnderstood of the Militant state of
the church vnder grace, yet 1. it proues the Sabbath
of Christians and the worship exercised on it, only
to be <hi>foreseene,</hi> and fore-spoken of by the spirit of
God, but not to be <hi>commanded</hi> by God: <hi>Prophecies</hi>
are no <hi>Decrees.</hi> And 2, although it were not onely
foreseene, but also preordained by the counsell of
God, yet might that ordinance haue effect, without
divine commandement, by humane constitution.</p>
               <p>3 Or if it imply a commandement of God tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the <hi>Sabbaticall</hi> worship of God, their doth it
also of that <hi>monthly</hi> worship (in the <hi>New Moones</hi>)
which is vtterly abandoned in the church of God:
both which together the Apostle doth reject. Col.

but considered <hi>Formally,</hi> as touching the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

from worke was giuen, and he it is that impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the worke.</p>
            <p>2 The worke considered <hi>Naturally</hi> is the servants
that doth it. but <hi>Morally</hi> it is the Masters that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him to doe it, or else it would not be done:
The servants in <hi>Act,</hi> the Masters in <hi>Imputation.</hi>

and so seemes to sinne against God in being
willing to further the breach of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
or <hi>vnwillingly,</hi> which seemes not to agree
with his duty towards his Master.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In this last respect the servant ought to worke
willingly, because he oweth willing obedience to
his Master touching labour, not so in the former.
So that the worke, which of his owne absolute &amp;
primary will or election he would not doe, yet he
doth of a conditionall and secundary will, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the condition of a servant, who is bound
(touching matter of labour) to submit his owne
will to his Masters pleasure.</p>

            <p>2 The <hi>Qualitie</hi> of the worke, <hi>sinfulnesse;</hi> as a
transgression of Gods law; of which, as the first is
in Nature before the latter, so the readinesse and
obedience of a good Servants will, extends it selfe
to the first, not to the latter, <hi>id est,</hi> as it is his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<hi>Worke,</hi> not his <hi>sinne.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> The servants worke on the Sabbath is the
Masters sinne, therefore if the servant consent to
the worke, he consents to the Masters sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol:</hi> To that which is sinne Materially, but not to
it as it is sinne Formerly; for it is considered either
as the Execution of his <hi>Masters command,</hi> and so he
consenteth; or as the transgression of <hi>Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:6800:23"/>
and so he consenteth not. So that hee
consents onely to the worke, <hi>Per se,</hi> to the sinne
<hi>Per Accidens,</hi> onely as it is annexed to such a
worke. The Act then of the consent passeth onely
to the worke, no farther, and yeeldeth an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
no further then to it, no way approuing of
the transgression, or sinne annexed with it. As I
may loue a learned man, that is withall vitious; yet
I loue him for his learning, not for his vice; so the
servant his Masters worke, as it hath adioyned his
Masters <hi>profit</hi> not his <hi>sinne.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The servant ought to prevent his Masters sin
by lawfull meanes, not by vnlawfull: Disobedience
touching matter of labour is vnlawfull; and evill
must not be done, for the good that may come of
it. The servant therefore may <hi>advise</hi> or <hi>intreat</hi> his
Master, but <hi>disobey</hi> he must not; Neither doth hee
in that case lend his hand to the worke as it is his
Masters sinne, but as the performance of a servants
duty, which is to labour for his Masters profit,
when he shall be commanded by his Master.</p>

worke, but to sanctifie the Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. I answere first, the Commandement is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6800:23"/>
touching servants and cattle;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> 
               <hi>Take heed to your
soules;</hi> what? the soules of your persons? no, for it
is giuen to the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> amongst others, ver.
20. But Kings did not carry burthens; But to the
<hi>soules</hi> vnder their charge, namely seruants &amp; cattle;
for the seruants are called in Scripture their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
soules,</hi> as appeares Gen: 12. 5, &amp; 36. 6, yea the
worke that is immediately specified, <hi>viz. carrying of
burthens</hi> (the peculiar worke of seruants and cattle)
imports so much.</p>
            <p>2 The Commandement is giuen touching them
to the Kings and the inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> not
to the seruants themselues;</p>
            <p>First, because that charge was giuen to them, to
whose fathers the commandement of the Sabbath
had beene anciently giuen vers. 22.<note place="margin">The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the cittizens of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for the <hi>Iewes</hi> had no word to signifie a citizen but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> but those were
the <hi>naturall</hi> Israelites, whereas their servants were
for the most part <hi>strangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, because the charge is given to them
out of whose houses burthens were forbidden to
be carried vers. 22. but those were the <hi>Cittizens</hi> or
owners, not <hi>servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, because the charge was giuen to them
of whom it is said, <hi>They would not heare nor obey,
but made their necks stiffe.</hi> vers. 23. which cannot be
vnderstood of servants; for would not they haue
beene glad of one dayes rest, after a whole weekes
toyle? or had they rather vndergoe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall toyle
and paine to breake Gods commandements, then
take their ease to keepe it and please God?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Commandement it selfe, <hi>Carry
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6800:24"/>
no burthens, neither doe any worke in the Sabbath,</hi>
that is, let none be carried, doth import as much.
For although the worke touching the <hi>Execution</hi> of
it, were the worke of their servants, and cattle; yet
it is the Masters and owners by a iust <hi>imputation,</hi>
because done by their commandement: and the
servants &amp; cattle are but their Instruments meerely
vnder their dominion and appointment. So that in
Gods estimation, <hi>They</hi> are reckoned to carry those
burthens, which by their Commandements are
carried.</p>
            <p>The Commandement is not giuen to servants
as servants, that is, touching workes commanded
them by their Masters,</p>
            <p>1 Because it is giuen to them, to whom this
speech is directed. <hi>Thy servant shall doe no worke,</hi>
but that is the Master. Exod. 20. 10.</p>
            <p>2 Because the rest of servants was one speciall
end of that Commandement, <hi>on the seauenth day
thou shalt rest, that the sonne of thy handmaid may be
refreshed,</hi> Deut. 5. 14. <hi>That thy man servant &amp; maid
may rest as well as thou.</hi> But the <hi>end</hi> of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
is not the <hi>matter</hi> of the commandement,
therefore servants are not commanded to rest.</p>
            <p>3 It is giuen to them who are willed to <hi>remember
that themselues were servants in the Land of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
and that the Lord had deliuered them from it,</hi>
Deut. 5. 15. but those were free men, not servants,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> 4. Because giuen to them who had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to keepe it without the transgression of the Law
of Nations (which the Lawes of God dissolue not)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6800:24"/>
But servants haue not that power (being meerely
(touching labour) at their Masters disposition, and
his Instruments: contrary, the Masters had that
power both for themselues, and their servants.</p>
            <p>5 Because it was more agreeable to reason, to
giue it to them who had more power, by reason of
their goverment, and were like to haue more care
of Gods Commandements, by reason of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and age. But both these belonged to the
Masters rather then to the servants.</p>
            <p>6 Because servants are often commanded <hi>to obey
their Masters in all things,</hi> touching labour, but
no where in Scripture either restrained, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
for such labours performed by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Commandement, but the Masters themselues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob:</hi> Servants working on the Sabbath at their
Masters command is <hi>scandalous,</hi> and giueth the
Godly occasion of <hi>offence.</hi>

with such workes done, yet not iustly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the poore servant, that vnwillingly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes

them.</p>

that is, offence against God; and <hi>Formally,</hi> Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whereby others are occasioned to fall into sin,
that is, sinne against our neighbour; but improperly
taken for <hi>Passiue</hi> scandall, or scandall (as they call
it) <hi>taken;</hi> is, when that which in it selfe is no sinne,
becommeth to any other, through the errour or
frailty of the obseruer (who judgeth not aright) an
occasion of some sin. And of this latter sort of
scandals only, are servants workes done on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
by their Masters commandement, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
in relation to their Masters, are full and
proper scandalls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob:</hi> The servant ought not to obey his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
commanding the transgression of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements;
but when hee commands him to
worke on the Sabbath he doth so, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol:</hi> It is a transgression of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in respect of the <hi>Commander,</hi> not of the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter;</hi>
or else the proposition is true by transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Formally</hi> taken, but not <hi>Materially;</hi> namely for
the worke that hath the transgression annexed, not
<hi>Naturally,</hi> but <hi>Casually,</hi> as being done on such a day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob:</hi> God hath forbidden the Master to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his servant any worke on the Sabbath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he hath no right to command him such work,
therefore the servant may justly refuse it, being
commanded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol:</hi> The argument is denied; for although
God hath restrained the Masters commandement,
yet not so the servants obedience, by that precept:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6800:25"/>
and therefore the same service he oweth his Master
by the Law of Nations, he still stands bound vnto,
if it be exacted. So that the servant can neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
his Masters commandement <hi>iustly</hi> (because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
his Master be limited touching comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by that precept, yet is not the servants liberty
enlarged, or purposed to be so, but by the Masters
grant and consent) nor <hi>wisely;</hi> seeing in rejecting,
he incurreth his Masters displeasure &amp; punishment;
and in obeying he committeth no sinne.</p>

               <hi>Ob:</hi> Rest is giuen to servants by that Comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Exod. 23. 12. Deut. 5. therefore they may
iustly challenge it, and consequently they may
justly refuse worke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol:</hi> Rest is giuen to servants not <hi>Immediatly,</hi>
by any grant made directly to themselues, but <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi>
by commandement giuen to their Masters,
not to set them to worke: so that they are to expect
it by their Masters leaue and allowance, and not to
be their owne carvers: Wherein although the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
sinne against God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in not performing that deed
of mercy towards their servants, which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to performe; yet is not the servant
thereby loosed from his obligation of servile obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
much lesse ought he to make himselfe his
Masters iudge in pronouncing of his owne liberty,
but if he may challenge it, it must bee by lawfull
course, as by complaint vnto them, to whom the
ouersight of lawes belong, who yet cannot iustly
