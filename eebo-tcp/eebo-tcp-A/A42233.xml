            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He terror of Hell which is ſet forth to us in holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, doth ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble to us the miſeries which are endured in priſon, that if this had not that hope which th'other wanteth we might attribute unto it the title of a true Hell, ſeeing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108986:8"/>
that in this which is moſt proper to them, the one and the other haue a mutuall and full correſpondence, which maketh me to wonder much at the vnprofitable diligence with which ſome late writers diſtill their brain's to finde the meanes how they may properly repreſent unto the world the horrour of that terrible manſion, when they might have attained to the end of their purpoſe in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely the deſperate life which people ſuffer in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which ſhall be perfitly knowne with its extreame miſerie, if firſt of all we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly treate of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are perpetually exerciſed in Hell.</p>
               <p>The Authors, who write upon this ſubject, bring the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108986:8"/>
paines of Hell to two points; the firſt and chiefe of which is their depriving from the eſſence of God, which they call eſſentiall paine, it being that, which properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all the torments that can be imagined in Hel. And that ſame is ſo extreame and ſo cruell, that if the ſoule had in the other world as many pleaſures and contentments as the thought of man could imagine, being deprived of God, it could not have any thing which had one onely ſhadow of comfort. Becauſe that God being the roote and the fountaine of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all contentments and delights, which are in the world being ſtored up in him alone, it is evident that with him the ſoule ſhall have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108986:9"/>
all conſolation which is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be imagined and that without him it ſhall be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a bottomleſſe depth of ſorrow &amp; confuſion, with which and with the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that it hath, that its griefes ſhall never be ended, it cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its being, its birth and its life.</p>
               <p>The other paine which the damned ſuffer in Hell is the accidentall paine, ſo called becauſe it is joyned to the former as an accident, which ſerveth to make the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the damned more ſenſible, throwing them headlong into the bitter ſight of their miſerie. To this is joyned the deteſtable companie of Divells, the horrible and frightfull lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, the ſeverall kindes of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108986:9"/>
torments, the continuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, the diſorder, the confuſion, the fire, the brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, the darkeneſſe and a thouſand other afflictions, of which, and of the depriving of Gods being and preſence, that wretched and perpetuall Hell is compoſed.</p>
               <p>And as touching the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of officers, that beare rule in this darke dungeon; wee know already that in that great battell which Saint <hi>Michael</hi> th'Archangell had againſt <hi>Lucifer,</hi> for the throne and the glory of the Creator, not onely the ſame <hi>Lucifer</hi> fell from Heaven, and from the higheſt of his perfection to the loweſt and holloweſt gulfes of Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo a great number of evill angells with him, who were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108986:10"/>
copartners with him in his raſh and accurſed purpoſe. And theſe although they do equally partake with him in the paine eſſentiall, which is being deprived of God, have nevertheleſſe ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence amongſt themſelves: whether it be that everyone is of one kind, as ſaith a Doctor of the Church, or whether for that they had more or leſſe conſent in his malice. Becauſe that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt thoſe who obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly defended the pride of <hi>Lucifer</hi> fell with him into the deepeſt place of the earth which is the center of the the world where divines doe place Hell. And thoſe who were not ſo vehement; but onely approved his purpoſe with a certaine and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108986:10"/>
fellow-liking, fell not ſo low: I will ſay that the accidentall paine of them was not ſo great as that of theſe others. And of this ſort the accidentall paine of theſe ſpirits was made ſeverall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degrees of the malice which they had in their ſinne. And though that in Hell there is no order, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith; there is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a certaine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and order among theſe ſpirits vnder-placed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeverall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies with diverſe degrees and qualities. So as the good Angells in the heavenly <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> are divided by their order into Angells, Archangells, Thrones, Powers, Cherubins, Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, and other holy dignities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:108986:11"/>All the Legions of Divels which fell from Heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſubject to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angell <hi>Michael,</hi> who hath commandement and empire overthem all. As alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſome mens opinions, every good Angell of Princes hath commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over one Legion. And beſide the obedience which all of them owe to Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> as to their Captaine Generall vnder God, they have alſo among them their Prince of malice, to whom they are ſubject and obey, and upon him depend diverſe Lievetenants and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, who wholly divide the governement of all the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh malice, every one of them having vnder his charge the diſpoſing and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108986:11"/>
good order of his band. Neither leſſe nor more than in a well ordered Campe, where there is a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Souldiers, the body of the armie is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſeverall Regiments, as are the Generall, the Camp-maſter, Captaines, Enſignes, Sergeants, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralls and others of this ſort, who order the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and the armie. And as there are ſundry Offices of theſe, ſome being foote, others horſe, ſome Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, others Pikemen, and finally of ſeverall employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: there are alſo among the evill ſpirits ſeverall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and places, ſome temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by Covetouſneſſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by Riotouſneſſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by Ambition, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108986:12"/>
every particular ſinne hath its appointed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Officers, having all of them equally; one onely end and ſcope to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſoules to Hell.</p>
               <p>In this Divelliſh armie there are ſome Divels, that never come out of Hell, but are evermore ſhut up within it, receiving the ſoules which enter in thither, and giving to them a place and kinde of torment which their ſinnes deſerve. There are others who are ever wandring, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsing the earth to and fro,</hi> and ſearching for ſoules to carrie them into Hel. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe let no man thinke that theſe have any power or authoritie to beare away one ſoule to Hell, nor theſe others to ſhut up in their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108986:12"/>
darke dennes, vnleſſe it be by the expreſſe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of God. And ſo much concerning theſe hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Officers.</p>
               <p>As for its largeneſſe, it is ſuch, that all ſorts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoules enter into Hell, and it is ordinarily full fraughted and peopled with Blaſphemers, Perjur'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Murtherers, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Envious perſons, and to conclude with all ſorts of Evill-doers: who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the eſſentiall paine, which is the wanting of God, and are all of them in Hell, yet they have ſeverall roomes and torments accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to everie ones defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſithence it is certaine
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108986:13"/>
that the paine of him that oweth little ſhall not be ſo great at all as the paine of him that oweth much, and that the juſt Iudge chaſtiſeth and recompenſeth every one according as he deſerveth.</p>
               <p>To all this varietie is added the extreme confuſion of Hell, the diſorder, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, the vnrulie cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and continualagitation, with which they are alwaies tormented, ſeeing it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that where rage and deſpaire reigneth, there can be no friendly fellowſhip nor agreement.</p>
               <p>This eſtate, practiſe &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the horrible pit of this helliſh lodging is the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pourtraict of that deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate life, which men ſuffer in priſon, in which the beholder
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108986:13"/>
ſhal find ſo in tire &amp; ſo mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a correſpondence that there is not almoſt any other difference between them but in the name. Becauſe that firſt to the eſſentiall paine of Hel, which is the depriving of Gods powerful preſence, the want of liberty hath correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, which with a juſt title we may cal a paine eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, for ſo much as it is the queen of al the apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſions &amp; motives of ſorrow, which are able to afflict a good wit.</p>
               <p>And as in that, the ſoule being deprived of God, it is alſo deprived of all worldly pleaſures, even ſo in this (to wit in priſon) it enjoyeth not any thing which hath the leaſt ſhadow of content. Becauſe that although a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner were clothed with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108986:14"/>
ſerved as a King, fed with the moſt delicate vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes of the world, his Chamber hang'd with cloth of gold, that hee were entertained with all ſort of Muſicke, viſited by his parents and friends, all this, nor all that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired more could bring him any kinde of comfort. On the contrary he ſhould have leſſe, becauſe that all things availe nothing but to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his appetite and make him deſire that which others enjoy, and to which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine. Whence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the increaſing of his want (of libertie) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his paine.</p>
               <p>The harſhneſſe and force of depriving (of libertie) may be eaſily, known by its
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108986:14"/>
contrarie, this being infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the depriving of one thing ſhall be by ſo much evill as the poſſeſſion of it ſhall be good. And libertie being the moſt precious Iewell of the ſoule, and the greateſt perfection, which the vnbounded Author of this, hath engrafted in the reaſonable creature; it is certaine that the depriving thereof ſhall be the moſt croſſe and vnſufferable of all others. That libertie is that which guideth and directeth mans actions to diverſe ends, without enforcing them and with pleaſure, chooſing, and commanding, experience teacheth this, in which the ſupreme work-maſter would diſtinguiſh man from other living creatures, whoſe end
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108986:15"/>
obtaineth by a naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, which leadeth them, as by a bridle, to the appetite and delight in it, and that it is ſo powerfull, and maketh man ſo abſolute, that his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding having propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the good, the perfect, the honeſt and the delectable, he may reſolve with himſelfe to love it or not to love it at all, ſith that none but God may aske a reaſon of this ſo abſolute commandement, Naturall Philoſophie telleth it. Whence and from many other reaſons, which I could bring, it is clearely perceived that there is not any thing in the world, to which the eſſentiall paine of Hell can more properly be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than to the depriving of libertie, ſeeing it bringeth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108986:15"/>
man to ſuch extremitie, that he abhorreth himſelfe, his being, his ranke, and his eſtate.</p>
               <p>He knoweth well this truth which I write, who hath ſometimes beene in priſon, laded with chaines and with irons, ſubject to the rage of that terrible abode, curſing (though Noble and well borne) his being, his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Nobleneſſe, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be that which he is, and wiſhing to be a great deale meaner. In midſt of which deſpaire hee envieth the peaceable condition and tranquillity, of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and could wiſh to have beene borne of the moſt baſe dregs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He curſeth his actions and his ſtudies, the points of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108986:16"/>
honour which his parents taught him, the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which he hath, thinking with himſelfe, that if he were a privat man, he ſhould not at all ſee himſelfe in ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ſo extreame a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie, and that this would not be litle enough for him, if deſpaire left him amongſt the folke of that ſame ſort and nature: but it goeth on refining and conſuming him in the fire of impatience, in such ſort, that it draweth him out of his reaſonable being, and bringeth him to that of a brute beaſt, and to the moſt baſe and infinite kindes of them, that groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for libertie, he envieth the bird that flieth, the Dog that barketh, the Piſmire that travelleth, and deſireth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108986:16"/>
to be one of them. And the venome of this fierce beaſt ſtayeth not there, for tying harder the cords of a poore priſoner, it draweth him out of the ranke and file of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, making him deſire to be a tree, an image or a ſtone, bringing him to nothing, and making him bewaile that ever hee was borne in the world. By which it is clearely ſeene that the want of liberty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo unhappy a change in man, as to throw him headlong from the higheſt &amp; moſt perfect of his inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and appetite, to the baſeſt and loweſt, and from the image and likeneſſe of God, to nothing; this is the moſt ſtrong and moſt rigorous paine that can be imagined,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108986:17"/>
and that which truely doth better repreſent the eſſential paine of Hell.</p>
               <p>To the accidentall paine doe correſpond the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable afflictions and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which follow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving of libertie, amongſt which are the ſtinke of the priſon, the diſorderly frame of the buildings, the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med companie, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and huge lewd voices, the diverſitie of nations, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering humors, the ſhame, the perſecution, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, the mocquerie, the crueltie, the blowes, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the poverty and the miſeries without number, which are ſuffered in priſon, of the which, and of other depriving of libertie the lively patterne of Hell is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108986:17"/>
framed and compoſed.</p>
               <p>As touching the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners and officers, no man will deny but that all the earth is full of incarnat Divells, more obſtinate and more accurſed in their kinde than thoſe of Hell, the moſt part of them being fallen, as <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his followers, from the Heaven of honour. I will ſay that for the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and ſinnes which they have committed, the Angell Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> who is the Iuſtice, hath drawne them from the fellowſhip and dwelling of the good, and they ſeeing themſelves bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe and diſhonoured, have taken vpon them the office of Divels, to avenge themſelves of the poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſoules, running day
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108986:18"/>
&amp; night thorow the ſtreets, markets and publike places of the Citie, ſmelling out and ſearching for people to lay them in priſon. And theſe are they who commonly are called Sergeants, who drag a poore man to priſon with ſuch rage and tyrannie, as theſe in the perpetuall Hell could not utter more. And if we be able to find any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene them, it is this, that the Divells of Hell fly from the ſigne of the Croſſe; but thoſe of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon love, reverence and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore that happy ſigne, in ſuch ſort, that hee who would deale well with them, and ſomewhat turne their rigour into a litle pitie, it is neceſſarie that hee have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the Croſſe in his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108986:18"/>
hands, for at what time hee ſhall leave it, they will tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him ten times more than his ſinne can deſerve: but they having met with him, they ſay a <hi>Pater noſter</hi> for the ſoule which they take, untill they come to <hi>da nobis hodie,</hi> and they goe not at all any further.</p>
               <p>Theſe Divells are thoſe who walke commonly through the ſtreetes, and places of the Citie, ſeeking for ſoules in the moſt ſecret corners, the multitude and trade of whom is ſo great, that I doe not thinke there are mote Legions of Divels in Hell, than there be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Amongſt them there be ſome that goe on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, who have charge to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108986:19"/>
travell into the Countrey, unto places farre remote from the Citie, and to bring men into priſon from places moſt ſolitarie and quiet. Theſe, for that they being of a more haughtie nature than the others, we may call Orientalls from the Region of fire, and theſe are called Archers or Meſſengers, the Legion or companie of whom hath for their Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or Captaine a great Divell whom they call Proveſt.</p>
               <p>There are other Divels in this Hell, the inferiors of the aforenamed, who goe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily by tens or twenties in a companie, diſguiſed and masked, to ſpie if they can catch one poore ſoule by treacherie, they are ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108986:19"/>
cowardly ſo effeminate and daſtardly, that they meete ſometimes to the number of fortie and all to take one man, and yet they dare not adventure to take him their ſelves alone, without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and aide of a Divell with a long gown, who vſually accompanieth them. They goe alwayes atter'd, torne and naked, and this is the loweſt and moſt infinite Legion of all as the Hob-goblins vnder ground, whom the people have beene accuſtomed to call Apparitors.</p>
               <p>Every Legion of theſe<note place="margin">Spaniſh apparitors what ſort of people.</note> Divells have an infinite number of halfe-divells who goe diſguiſed and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered through the Citie, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of all that is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108986:20"/>
done there, with great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie and craft. They take and change every day a thouſand formes and ſhapes, ſhewing themſelves in every companie in a ſeverall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; at one occaſion going like countrey-men, in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like ſtrangers, by &amp; by of one profeſſion, and by and by of another. Theſe are they who with great ſleight and ſubtiltie diſcover the price, after the ſame manner as the lying dogs doe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, bringing the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Divels to the proper place of the ſoule, which they would take, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it out as with the finger: and theſe we call Spies, and amongſt them they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Recorders.</p>
               <p>There be other Divels,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108986:20"/>
who are eſteemed more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and more courteous, whoſe office is to repeale penalties, commiſſions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, to baile a ſoule, and to take the burthen on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, anſwering for it every time that the Iudge asketh for it. And though it be in their keeping, they give it alwayes time and place to ſolicite its owne affaires, to viſite its Iudges, and to pleade its cauſe, vſing with it ſome pitie and friendſhip. Finally they have a nature mingled with goodneſſe and malice, and they are betweene Divels and Angels, whom by reaſon of the familiaritie which they have with man, wee may call them Airie Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells; and theſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108986:21"/>
people call doore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers.</p>
               <p>All theſe aforeſaid divels, &amp; others whom I leave to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for avoiding prolixitie, are found in the world, every one of whom goeth ſeverall waies, leading ſoules into the Hell of priſon, &amp; all of them, after the manner of evil ſpirits are divided into divers Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and troopes. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they torment not the ſoules becauſe they enter not into Hell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, onely they deliver them to <hi>Lacifers</hi> Lievetenant the Iayler, &amp; returne inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent vnto their walke; for to give up their account to their Captaine, of the tentations which they have practized that day, and of the number of ſoules which they have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried that day to priſon, every
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108986:21"/>
one of them reckoning up the inventions &amp; wiles which he hath practized in his helliſh Office. There be alſo other divells which never go out of the priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor have any other imployment, but to torment the poore ſoules which enter in thither. And thoſe are ſo tyrannous, ſo cruel &amp; ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that they ſatisfie not their inraged hunger but by ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bloud, &amp; the life of the poore captive that fals among their hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> albeit they ſuffer him to breath ſo long; while they have emptied his purſe. And theſe be the under por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; ſervants of the Iayler, who, as a Preſident of that dreadfull dwelling, receives the priſonner from the hands of the Sergeant and writes in his booke the day of his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108986:22"/>
entring, his accuſation, his name and the name of that Divell that hath taken him.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſhut-up Divells have no power nor authoritie to torment a ſoule which the others do bring in, nor theſe others to take them, but by the command of Iuſtice declared by ſome honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Officer, who with reaſon and truth by a ſigned writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chargeth theſe uncleane ſpirits to take ſuch a ſoule.</p>
               <p>As for the reſt it may well be proved that every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant hath power to leade a man to priſon, even ſo as every Divell may beare a ſoule to Hell, ſeeing that there ordinarily entreth thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an infinite number of priſoners, and every one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned by his ſeverall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108986:22"/>
Iudge: ſome anſwer before a Iudge with a long gown, others before one with a ſhort gown, without recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, many other officers of Iuſtice, who as good Angels have authoritie and power to exerciſe it, who have their appointed and praticular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, who execute their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment and will.</p>
               <p>As touching the diverſitie of the lodgings and places of their abode, the curious ſhall ſee many differing in the priſon, every one fitted for the priſoners delight. For hee who is not criminall, and who is Noble is uſually lodged in the lightſomeſt chambers and neateſt contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but underſtand that the Nobleneſſe of a priſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in a good purſe. Thoſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108986:23"/>
that be of a meaner qualitie &amp; deſerving are fitted in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain darke &amp; black chambers, where ſmoke and cinders continually beareſway.</p>
               <p>The priſon hath yet this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Hel, to take in all ſort of ſinners &amp; criminals, being uſually peopled, and full of Theeves, Ruſſians, Cut-pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Panders, Whoores, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, Perjured men, Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, Cheaters, Uſurers, &amp; Sorcerers, in as great varietie as the living creatures that entered into <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, ſo that entry is not denied nor the gate ſhut againſt any.</p>
               <p>Of this remarkeable variety the confuſed multitude of a priſon is compoſed with a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d other circumſtances which accompanie it, which becauſe it is altogether diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108986:23"/>
&amp; without bounds I ſhal not be able to reduce it to one terme or name, nor to give it a definition which Univerſally comprehendeth all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this dreadfull dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, if the curious Reader will not be contented with the Analogie and proportion which it hath with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Hell. The which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed as a thing moſt proper to a priſon, we ſhall be able to deſcribe it by its properties &amp; by experience, ſaying, that a priſon is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but a land of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, a dwelling of darkenes, a habitation of miſerie or an eternall horrour inhabited without any kind of order. It is a confuſed Chaos without any diſtinction, it is a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomles pit of violence which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108986:24"/>
hath nothing that is in its own center, it is a tower of Babylon where all ſpeake and none heare, it is a med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley againſt nature, in which is ſeene the peace and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two contraries, mingling the Noble with the infamous, the rich with the poore, the civill with the criminall, the ſinner with the juſt, it is a communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with agreement; one whole by accident, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition without parts, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion without orders or Lawes, and a body without a head. The priſon is the grave of Nobleneſſe, the baniſhment of courteſie, the poyſon of honour, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of infamie, the quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of diſparagement; the hell of good wits, the ſnare
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108986:24"/>
of pretences, the paradiſe of couſenage, the martyrdome of innocence, the cloude of truth, the treaſure of deſpaire the fining-pot of friendſhip, the wakener of rage, the baite of impatience, the mine of treaſons, a den of Foxes, the refuge of vengeance: the puniſhment of force, and the headſman of life. There he that yeſterday was great, to day is meane; hee that was happy in the City, now ſtarveth there; he that was richly clad, is ſtarke naked, he that commanded, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; he that had his court full of caroches and rich ſaddles, findeth not now one more to viſite him. There civilitie is turned into inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, courage to ſubtiltie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhameleſſe outfacing into
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108986:25"/>
vertue, blaſphemie into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, flattery into eloquence lyes to truth, ſilence to noiſe modeſtie to boldneſſe, knowledge to ignorance, and order to confuſion: And to end the miſerie of that unluckie place: I conclude in ſaying that it is a forreſt-full of wilde beaſts, in which the one teareth the other, eating his heart and drinking his bloud, ſo that no ſcruple of conſcience, feare of God, ſuſpition of love, compaſſion or other reſpect whatſoever which can have any ſhadow of vertue or of goodneſſe is able to hinder them. There one weepeth and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſingeth, one prayeth and another blaſphemeth, one ſleepeth, another wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, one goeth out, another
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108986:25"/>
commeth in, one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, another abſolved, one payeth, another deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and finally one ſhall hardly finde two of one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and will. One will be eating in a corner, another will piſſe behind him: and in the middle of them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall pull off his ſhirt and ſtrip himſelfe ſtarke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Every one is imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his particular exerciſe, they not having any other houre or time appointed for that ſave their will, which being diſordered, free in its actions, produceth them without any let or ſhame. In that which concerneth the ſuſtenance of life, there is no order kept there among them, becauſe that hunger is their appetite, their time of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108986:26"/>

As for napkins, they take their skirts, or the outſide of their breeches, and for a table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth the wrongſide of a poore old cloake, threed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare and fuller of Beaſts than that linnen cloth which <hi>S.

They live Apoſtollically, withoutſcrip without ſtaffe and without ſhooes, having nothing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous nor double: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe there is ſo great ſimplicitie that they cover all their body with one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhirt, whereof many times they have no more ſave the ſleeves, and they never leave it off till it can go alone of its owne accord.

We cannot ſay that there is any kinde of vices in the priſon, becauſe that idleneſſe the mother of them hath no entrie there, becauſe they are all carefull and watchfull to ſearch for that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for life: and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus time they ſpend in exerciſing themſelves on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe inſtruments of Muſicke having the itch for the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe of that vertue.</p>

They live in Evangelicall hope never troubling themſelves with the care of that which they ſhould eate or drinke to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.

With this comfort they live, ever dying, putting cataracts and deceiveable imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before the eyes of their reaſon. And if by chance the time of their impriſonment

endeth, and Iuſtice giveth aſſent that ſome one of them goe forth, then the Divell is ſo carefull and ſo watchfull troubling and quelling his libertie, that it ſeemeth to him there are no gates through which hee can get out. One withholds him asking a debt thirtie yeares old, another the ſucceſſion of one of his grandfathers, and another ſheweth a band more ancient than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge. And when his diligence and meanes have delivered him from his enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, theſe within doores begin to thunder out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſong, for one deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of him five ſhillings which he lent him eleven months ago, another that ſhould pay for a pot which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108986:29"/>

This man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that he ſhould pay him the good-morrow's which he hath given him, another the good nights, one askes his Cap, another his Doublet, another his Shooes and all lay hold upon him. And when he eſcapeth this importunate ſwarm of Bees, theſe tunes begin to deafe his eares; the Iayler de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of him the rights of the priſon, his entrance, his going forth, and the time that he hath tarried there, for his ſleeping, his talking, his eating, his ſneeſing and his coughing, and all the time that he hath lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108986:29"/>
there, making more ſcores in his booke than an Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger on the erecting of an Horoſcope. And when he hath given him that which he demands of him without reaſon, he askes his gloves, his Iayle fees, his ſlippers, his old ſhooes and a coife for the maide-ſervant. The Dog askes him to pay for his watching and barking that he hath kept for him while he ſlept, the Cat for the paines ſhe hath taken to cleare his chamber from Mice and Rats, one pulls him on this ſide and another on that, and all catch hold of him like briers, while they have left him dry, pluckt bare, throng'd and as naked as his mother bare him.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end that none be deceived with this proverbe which moſt men hold for a <hi>Maxime,</hi> when they ſay, That all noveltie is well pleaſing; becauſe that albeit Logicke ſhould not condemne this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as falſe, experience would diſcover its deceit: for I doe not thinke that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108986:31"/>
there is any one in the world that hath found the priſon pleaſant, even at the firſt time that he entred therein. I may ſay of my ſelfe, that when I was there, though it was new to me I found not any thing that I liked; on the contrarie, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which novelties bring with them was turned into notable admiration and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame paine, ſeeing that which willingly I would not have ſeene, and talking of that which leaſt pleaſed me. I ſpent the firſt dayes even as all thoſe, who enter into that place have beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to paſſe them, which is to conſider the lodgings, to be vexed at the companie, and to ſhun the familiar converſing with the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108986:32"/>
priſoners. And I might have paſt all the time of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment in ſuch like em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, if it had lien in my power to do it, becauſe that the companie invited me not to acquaint my ſelfe. But the neceſſitie being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with exceeding great curioſitie which priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have, when any one entereth newly into priſon, tied me to frame my ſelfe to the uſuall faſhion of theſe people, from whom I had a ſufficent report of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and qualities of that habitation, without other paines-taking than to give them the hearing, becauſe that by it a diſcreete man ſhall know moe ſins in foure dayes than a Confeſſor in a hundreth yeares. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108986:32"/>
with a faire ſhew and ſome pieces that I had in my purſe I purchaſed the good will of all the rable, in ſuch ſort, that there was not any man of what ranke ſoever who did not eſteem much of me, &amp; participated not with me the moſt inward of his conſcience. But the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall companie of this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious converſation troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me, in ſuch ſort that I was not mine owne, nor had I the libertie to ſpend one quarter of an houre by my ſelfe alone. So leſſayed by a thouſand meanes to ridde my ſelfe from the head-ſtrong importunities of thoſe undiſcreet people, but it was not poſſible for me to free my ſelfe, without taking the office that I had
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108986:33"/>
got over them. Wherefore I was deſirous to trie, if in this martyrdome, ſeeing I deſerved no ſuch thing, I could finde ſome pleaſure to divert my minde and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them. So continuing my no leſſe accuſtomed than troubleſome occupation, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one day upon a bench which was in the Chappell of the priſon, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of three or foure of theſe gallants, hearing ſome difficulties, whereof they were come to conſult with mee upon the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, I heard the Echo of a ſorrowfull voyce, which called me pitifully. All the ſtanders by were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed; one of them ranne to be informed of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked forn ewes, but the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108986:33"/>
ſpeedy haſt of him, which ſought for me, prevented the curioſitie of him who was gone out to know the newes; for ſcarſly had we heard the voyce, when after it, entred at the doore one of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious followers (held in great eſteeme amongſt thoſe people who were none of the holieſt) with his colour changed, his viſage bathed with teares, without a Hat, his armes croſſed, ſighing and beſeeching with great humilitie the companie, that they would let him be alone with me, amplifying his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt by the ſhortneſſe of time, as the principall reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of miſhap. They depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the place, and he ſeeing himſelfe alone and with freedome to diſcover his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108986:34"/>
thoughts to me, without any other preface, preamble, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement or courteſie, he ſaid to me.</p>
               <p>Sir, to day is my feaſt day, and they have made me a gift of a clarke of a harbour, with a Cardinalls Hat: what remedie ſhall I be able to finde for ſo great a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. Verily this darke ſpeech of his words, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the manner of telling it, held mee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in doubt, becauſe I knew not how to comment upon ſo vncouth a language followed with ſo many ſighes and groanes. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe making a little ſtay at theſe words and already gueſſing that which it might be, I beleeved that he had got this hat at ſome pot of wine,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108986:34"/>
and that out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereof this noble dignitie had climed up to the head. So ſmiling I ſaid to him: My friend, the Poſt that hath brought you this newes, is he of a douzen or of twentie? It is not of twelue, nor offoure, unhappy man that I am! anſwered he, for I am not drunke, nor ever was I in all my lifetime, and would to God that all the world were ſo retired in this action as I am: but as the Proverbe ſaith, ſome have the name, the others have the effect. And you doe not well to make a poore unhappie wretch that askes your counſell in his extreame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. His anſwer to the purpoſe redoubled my aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and not being able
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108986:35"/>
to hit at that which this might meane, I ſaid to him ſomewhat in anger; Make an end then to relate to me the cauſe of your paine, and hold me no more in doubt with your darke ſpeeches or ridles. Now I know, Sir, ſaid he, that yee have not ſtudied Martiall tearmes, nor you vnderſtand not as yet Galunatias his ſtile, ſo it will be hard for you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of two ſolide bodies with the perſpective of red flowers in a white field. From this ſecond anſwer I fully reſolved that hee was not drunke, but fooliſh, and as to ſuch a one, I agreed with him to all that he ſaid, although I vnderſtood him never a whit. And taking the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108986:35"/>
ſubject to reaſon with him upon the ſame reaſons, I asked him, who made him a Cardinall and why? To which he anſwered me thus. You ſhould underſtand that ſome officers of the <hi>three</hi> and of the <hi>five</hi> of <hi>Topo &amp;</hi>

They were deceived, and deſiring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their wrong, they went to <hi>Scipion,</hi> declaring an Vniverſall head which they had ſeene in my hands, upon which they made long informations by the <hi>Signe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108986:36"/>
which they had of me, they found mee not good enough to be Pope, they left me the office of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall. You ought to account your ſelfe happy, I anſwerd him, having ſo great a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, ſeeing that few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, and theſe with great paines and travell. I would quite it, withall my heart, ſaith he, and that without penſion, if any one would receive it for mee, and I would moreover binde my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe to him to pay for the ſeales, becauſe to ſpeake the truth, it is a charge too heavy for me, and hee that gives it, hath not any good repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among the people, nor many friends in the Citie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is the cauſe that I make no great account of it.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108986:36"/>
And doe not thinke that in ſaying, that I will no wayes accept of it, I can helpe my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe of this paine: for it is not in my power, nor in theirs who receive the like charges to be able to refuſe them, ſithence dignities are beſtowed by deſervings, and albeit that men refuſe them, they are made to take them by force, that no man may refuſe them nor make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance by too great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, they binde it upon him as if he were a foole. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my friend, ſaid I then to him, you ought to account your ſelfe happy and very fortunate, for ſuch an electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this being ſuppoſed that it is made for deſerving, and not for favour. Very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, faith hee, aſſuredly I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108986:37"/>
am, howbeit an vnworthy ſinner, but no wiſe happy, for if I were, I ſhould not be very fortunate. With this anſwer I began to ſee clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was neither fooliſh nor drunke: but that diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hee covered his words of this his chatting, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute to leave him with his—I riſe ſpeaking to him ſome harſh words, to which hee anſwered with great humilitie, ſaying, Sir I beſeech you to ſtay your choler a litle: for it is not without a myſterie, that I have ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to you in a riddle, and beleeve me that in this I have had no other intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to hide my miſhaps from ſome—who uſually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> watch harkning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the life of another, to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108986:37"/>
report them to their copſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. But now ſeeing that I can utter it to you without feare I will explaine my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe, being well aſſured that a man of ſo good a wit as you are, will not be offended to heare my weakeneſſe, and will not deny me your good counſell which out of your charitie I promiſe to my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe. So know that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is that which to day at noone one hit mee over the ſhoulders: The Clarke of harbour hee that receiveth ſuch as are condemned to the Gallies: thoſe of three, are ſome of our companie, are ſome that watch the ſtreete, when any theft is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and theſe have the third part: Thoſe of Five are ſome honorable perſons, or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108986:38"/>
at leaſt held for ſuch by the common people, who hide and keepe the theft in their houſe, and for that the fifth part is given to them. Now you ſhall know that by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking I being one night in a liſt that was made, the booty was ſo little, that there was not whereof to make neither fourth nor fifth, and I being the man that put himſelfe in greateſt danger I was willing to goe away withall, promiſing to redreſſe the bygone fault in another more gainefull occaſion. Thoſe of <hi>Seven,</hi> and <hi>Goe,</hi> I will tell my companions found not this ſatisfaction to the purpoſe, which I gave them, becauſe that abſolutely they would have their ſhare.

The wretch had proceeded thus far with the explaining of darke ſpeech, ere ever I could break off his diſcourſe, ſo great was the aſtoniſhment which his entangled meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors left me in, &amp; ending his ſtory with a deep ſigh, which came from his very ſoule, he fell halfe dead betweene my armes.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108986:42"/>
out the Philoſophers ſtone and the true <hi>Elixar</hi> of life, with which I turne poyſon into medicine, the courſe cloth into cloth of gold, and hunger into fulneſſe and ſatietie more than ſufficient, without putting any thing to it of my goods, ſave the turning of a hand. I doe not deale as a thouſand other ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people of our daies, who being blinded by the gainfull end which the practiſe of the great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers-ſtone promiſeth them doe adventure raſhly to ſpend all to finde nothing, &amp; to vndoe a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand eſſences to finde one fifth both vncertaine and falſe, whoſe exceſſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie have none other end but infamie, miſerie and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108986:42"/>
and finally a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death: for as much as thoſe who have conſum'd their owne goods and the goods of their friends, to ſearch for that which they have not found, utter their rage with ſtrokes of ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers upon the ſeven mettals, which are the cauſe of their overthrow. And which is worſe, with all the tryalls and vnhappie ends of Alcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, there is not any man to whom curioſitie will not awaken the appetite, and provoke the will every time that he heareth any man talke of this arte. Mine is not of this kinde, and therefore leſſe ſubject to the fancies and idle imaginations of <hi>Gebor Arnaut, Raymond Lully</hi> and other great Advancers
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108986:43"/>
of the arte, whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge conſiſteth in not to be underſtood; it is eaſie, plaine and without any mixture. Nevertheleſſe be who hee will that ſhall exerciſe it, it is neceſſarie that hee be wiſe, prudent and well adviſed, becauſe that wanting or fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in one whatſoever it be of theſe things, a man ſhall eaſily loſe in an inſtant all that he hath gained in all his life. This noble art alſo hath not <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, becauſe that as well he as all others that follow him, imagined that nothing could be made of nothing: this being true that in this our Art, all things are made of nothing; and if we may attribute any principle of them which he propoundeth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108986:43"/>
in his Phyſicks, it is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation only, ſeeing that from it alone we come to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of infinit wealth. As for our tooles, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe there are ſome, foraſmuch as there is no trade that can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, but nevertheleſſe they are ſo eaſie &amp; ſo cheape, that we well nigh make them our ſelves, after they are made, they laſt time out of minde. The ground then to buſie one of our trade, is onely the good courage and ſound diſpoſition of his body and limmes, and with this alone a man becommeth his crafts-maſter, without any other ornament—And doe not think that this Art, having ſo poore a beginning as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is ſhamful or infamous, for it is the moſt noble, the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108986:44"/>
abſolute and the moſt privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of all thoſe that are in the world, ſo farre forth that acknowledgeth nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth neither King nor knave, nor careth it for all the Monarchs of the earth, nor for the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtike power, nor for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: but rather all pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and travels for him. Its fields are fruitfull in drie grounds, it gathers the fruit without ſowing, it hath no traffique with any, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of all, it lendeth to no body, and all are indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, its harveſts grow without raine, and there is not any thing whereof it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not the tithes. There commeth not any fleete from the <hi>Indies,</hi> nor great ſhip from the <hi>Levant,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108986:44"/>
it not make ſhew to be partner, there is not a <hi>Guine</hi> Marchant, that is not its debtor, and finally, it cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth up all. And which ought to be moſt valued in this pretious Art, is the great eaſe with which it is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in which it exceeds all other Arts, that are till theſe our times found out in the world, the end of which is contrary to that of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is perfected in the doing, this in undoing, and to undoe being more eaſie than to doe (as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſaith) doubtleſſe it is but that our Art is eaſier than all others whoſe end is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with great paines, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells and difficulties.</p>
               <p>Honeſt <hi>Andrew</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further in the praiſes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108986:45"/>
and excellencie of his trade, if I had not broke him off with an extreame impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the titles of honour and nobleneſſe which hee gave it ſeeming to me alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improper, as well for that it is of it ſelfe imfamous, as for the innumerable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which uſually happen to them, who undertake ſuch like traffiques: wherefore I ſaid to him; I do not know, <hi>Andrew,</hi> how nor by what reaſon you your ſelfe reckon up to me theſe Arts ſo noble, ſo eaſie and ſo profitable, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you have related to me the perilous extremities in which you have beene, which your povertie and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity aſſure me to be of little profit &amp; of great miſery which is therein, that makes mee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108986:45"/>
to marvel very much at your perſevering in your unhappy trade, ere you were made wiſe by the experiences paſt. You have reaſon (he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) and I confeſſe that many hazards and diſgraces light upon vs, but one Oxe eateth more than a hundred Larks, I will ſay that one good encounter ſhoulders out many diſgraces, which have not in ſo great number as you thinke, and though they were, it is not poſſible for vs to give over this trade but by death, becauſe this Art hath I cannot tell what with it, that it is like one ſicke of the Dropſie, who the more he drinks the more he thirſts, and of one onely act there becommeth a habite, <hi>qui difficilè removetur a</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:108986:46"/>
                  <hi>ſubjecto,</hi> which is hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the ſubject. And I know wel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you wil like my doctrine well, being ſo learned a man as you are, ſeeing they are accuſtomed to diſpute among the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers if this maxime of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (who ſaith <hi>Expluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus actibus generatur habitus,</hi> of many actions is begot a habit) be Univerſally true. And ſome ſay that of one only action a habit may be bred, which ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of morall actions, and thoſe of worſer ſort: I will affirme that to breede a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall cuſtome in ſinning, one only action is ſufficient: but to doe well, there is need of many. The reaſon is cleere, for that the will of man being diſpoſed to ſinne,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108986:46"/>
becauſe it is called <hi>fomes peccati,</hi> the fewell of ſinne, and for the miſeries drawen upon it in its conception, one action alone leaveth in it a certaine inward diſpoſition with which it becommeth eaſie, and diſpoſed to like actions; but the deſire being ſo marred, corrupt and ill diſpoſed to receive vertue, there needeth not only one vertuous action, but many, if any diſpoſition or cuſtome of doing well ſhould remaine after it. By which you may judge that albeit a thouſand diſgraces fall upon us it were almoſt impoſſible for us to forſake our trade, nor change our life, having already tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it into a nature, and if this ſhould be done, it ſhould be needfull to make the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108986:47"/>
world a new againe, more or leſſe all wooll is haire, we are all of us of one brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, no man is content with his ſtate, he that hath moſt deſireth more, that which coſteth little agreeth beſt with us, and all (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe goeth) like well.</p>
               <p>But miſhap be to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat man who payeth for all; for as the Proverb ſaith, the Gallowes are for all ſuch, we rubbe all men, and for thoſe ſinnes ſome are hang'd, others are rich. Happy are they who robbe Hippocrates-like, I will ſpeake as the Phyſitians, whoſe faults the earth cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, ſo that no man is able to accuſe them, nor aske re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his life, and of the money which they have
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108986:47"/>
publickly rob'd and in the view of all the world. And though ſome of theſe be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall men, others tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, notwithſtanding all meete in the ſame way, and ſhoote at one marke: for there be alſo horſeleeches which ſucke the world ſweetly, and wring their necke, with a ſad dumpiſh countenance, and a faire ſhew colour their ambitious deſignes with godly words. And for them, it is ſaid in the Proverbe, the Divell is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Croſſe. There are others alſo, who though they wring not the necke, nor ſpeake ſo much of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply nevertheleſſe the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of their offices in favour of him that giveth them moſt; who being lap't
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108986:48"/>
in long wide gownes making them to bee reſpected there is not a man that dare to give the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a word, nor ſhew by any ſigne the evil ſatisfaction that they have by them: but the wretched perſon that neither hath God in his mouth, nor barke wherwith to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if he be not very wiſe &amp; prudent all the perſecutions of the world hang about him at once, all men ſpit in his face, and he is the marke of all the abuſes in the world: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blame not our Art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you underſtand it; for you ſhould ſo offend all the world &amp; perhaps your ſelfe, ſith no man liveth without fault. How much more if you knew what ſweetneſſe there is to gather the fruit where one hath not planted, and to find
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108986:48"/>
the in gathering in his garner &amp; in his cellar, himſelf having neither fielde nor vineyard, you would even licke your fingers at it. Is this a ſmal mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter I pray you, that a man ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the morning not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving penny nor farthing, nor knowing yet whence to have it for to nouriſh his family, and yet ere night he is worth a hundred crownes, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not whence they came? Is this a ſmall matter in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſloth and neceſſitie to finde apparell cut and ſlaſht without paying either for ſtuffe or making? Is there any ſuch Nobleneſſe in the world, as to be a Gentleman without rents, and to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens goods ſo his own, as that hee may diſpoſe of them at his will, without
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108986:49"/>
coſting him any more but to take them? Doe you thinke it a ſmall matter to be a Marchant without a ſtocke, to gaine two hundreth for nothing, without croſſing the ſeas, going to faire or market, not caring if the Marchant turne banque-rupt, if the yeare be barren or plentiful, if wares be deare or cheape? And if ye will take our trade by way of reputation or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, doth it ſeeme a ſmall thing to you, to finde one who will inſure us our life, whatſoever wee doe, and to have at our becke ſome Iudges, who ſave us from the laſh from the Gallies, from torture &amp; from the Gallowes only with a ſingle &amp; wel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red promiſe to ſatisfie them with the gaine of our next

theft? And that they do this not only for us, but for our friends, kindred and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Abuſe not yourſelfe, and acknowledge that there is no life more aſſured in this world than ours, for inſtead of one diſpleaſure that wee have, there are infinite plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and contentments to be enjoyed.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S for my race, you ſhall know that I am a man borne of a woman, in a town of this world, whoſe name I loſt in a ſickneſſe which I had in the yeare ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and foure. My, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was called <hi>Peter</hi> and my mother <hi>Hope,</hi> people, though meane, honorable and vertuous, of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and praiſe-worthy manners. And as for the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108986:50"/>
goods of fortune, they were not ſo great, that they were able to give bribes, nor marry Orphans out of their meanes, nor ſo meane, that they obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to aske almes, nor to ſubject themſelves to any man, but they were people that knew how to live, and that had bread to eate, and clothes to put on. In all the courſe of their life there was nothing found that they could be reproched for, nor whereof they could be reproved, becauſe they heeded no other thing (particularly my mother) but to keepe their honour and the good eſteeme which they had gained, for which and for the freedoome and faire conditions of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108986:51"/>
and converſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the world honored and loved them. But as vertue is ordinarily envied, and honeſt people perſecuted, there was no want of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and wicked people, who by falſe and raſh ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies darkned the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and gliſtering of their good works &amp; the cleannes of their life. They were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed (I ſay) to have robbed a Church, to have ſpoiled the Veſtrie with the ornaments and chalices, and which is worſe, to have cut off <hi>S. Bartholomews</hi> hand, who was upon an Altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they ſaid was of ſilver. An accuſation as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious as falſe, eſpecially, for my mothers part, whoſe devotion towards the Saints
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108986:51"/>
was ſo great, that when ſhe went to Church, if my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had not pull'd her out by the haire, or the Sexton had not ſhut the doore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, there was no meanes to make her come out of the Church, although ſhee had beene three dayes without meate, and her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion was ſo knowne to all the people, that ſhe never came forth to the ſtreete, but a thouſand folke praied her to ſay ſome <hi>Ave Maria</hi> for women with child, ſicke and other afflicted perſons, having all of them great faith in her prayers. But as there are traitors enough to condemne a juſt man, and in this age innocency ſerveth to no purpoſe, if it be not favoured, for ſo much as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108986:52"/>
the Lawes goe as it pleaſeth Kings, it came to paſſe that notwithſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches which they gave in againſt the witneſſes, more than ſufficient to refute the malice of the accuſers, and to manifeſt the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of the accuſed, they condemned them to die, and together with them a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mine, and my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Nephew. Verily the caſe was ſtrange and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, though falſe, and their death unjuſt: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the cauſe I doe not envie them the profit, which let them eate with their bread, they ſhall not goe to <hi>Rome</hi> for penance, for there is a God in the world that ſeeth all things, and ſeeing he puniſheth that

A tricke, finally that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poore, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to pay with their life, that which they were not able with their goods. I only may praiſe my ſelfe that I found ſome mercie with the Iudges, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of my young yeares, and of the ſmall experience that I had; yet the favour they ſhewed me, was a grace with ſinne: becauſe Iuſtice left me my life, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108986:53"/>
that I ſhuld be the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of theſe Martyres. I was very unwilling and did all I could, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo execrable a crime as that is, to take away their lives that had given me mine: but it was impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, but by loſing my life with them. Wherefore I conſidering that a nother would doe that, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and of the other ſide the perſwaſion of my friends who with a great charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my conſcience, counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me to doe it, that ſo the whole kindred of my parents ſhould not be loſt, and that there ſhould remaine ſome one in the world who might pray for them; I put on a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to doe that which for any other reſpect I
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108986:53"/>
would never have done. But this is my comfort, which is not a little one to me, that my father gave me his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at the houre of his death forgiving me all that I could have committed in this world, againſt the reſpect and reverence, which I owed him, giving me alſo ſome wholeſome counſels, and recommending to me vertue and the feare of God, above all that I ſhould ever ſtrive to be like my parents and that I ſhould ſhew my ſelfe ſuch a one as thoſe of whom I was deſcended. With theſe reaſons and ſome others I remained greatly comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reſolved to end my priſon with their life. I was left an Orphan, young, alone, or ill accompanied,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108986:54"/>
and without counſell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing what ſide to turne me to, for to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that life which theſe gentlemen had left me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the cockering and good cheere in which my mother had bred me, had beene the eſpeciall cauſe of my undoing, ſhee ſuffering me to live idlely and lazily.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe I ſeeing that the memorie of the good paſt brought me no profit, and that if I ſhould live and eate bread it ought to be with the ſweate of my browes, I determined to looke out for a maſter whom I might ſerve, or ſome han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die-crafts-man with whom I might learne ſome trade, which was all in vaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108986:54"/>
that the accident of my parents being in freſh memorie, and their infamie yet late, I found not one that would receive me into his houſe, nay not ſo much as to be a groome of his ſtable: wherefore I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave the countrey, and to goe try my fortunes in a ſtrange countrey. What countrey is that (I asked him then) in which your parents dwelt, becauſe if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the diſcourſe of your relation, you have changed its right name as alſo its ſurname, and your owne? Command me not, I beſeech you, anſwered he, to breake a ſolemne oath which we of our profeſſion have made amongſt our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves, which is never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108986:55"/>
to any man our owne countrey, nor our parents name, this being ſuppoſed that it availeth little to the truth of my hiſtory to know it, and though it ſeemeth to you that it is no myſterie to conceale it, beleeve me you are deceived for ſo much that there is nothing more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in our Art, than to tell a mans true name, as well as of his countrey, as of his baptiſme, ſeeing that as you know, albeit we be fallen a thouſand times into the hands of Iuſtice, and that we be as many times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of ſome crime, wee onely changing our name, we ever make it appeare that this is the firſt time that we have beene taken, and the firſt crime whereof we have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108986:55"/>
ever bin accuſed, and no man knowing the name of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, nor of our countrey they cannot be informed of our lives &amp; manners, nor our parents receive any ſhame from our diſgrace ſeeing that as you may oftentimes haue ſeene, when they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne a man the firſt words of his ſentence ſay; ſuch a one, of ſuch a place, the ſon of ſuch a man &amp; ſuch a woman is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be whipt or han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſuch a day, moneth and yeare, from which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothing elſe, but ſorrow to him that dyeth, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his parents. If this be ſo (ſaid I to him) you have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hid it, &amp; this being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that is not for your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile to telit, &amp; it availeth not me to know it, let us leave it,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108986:56"/>
and follow your Hiſtorie. It fell out then (ſaid hee) that about foure leagues from the place of my birth, I put my ſelfe apprentice to a Shooemaker, it ſeeming to mee to be the moſt gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all trades, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>France,</hi> where all thoſe that walke goe at it were poſt, even as if Iuſtice were running after them, and where all Shooe themſelves againſt nature, that which is contained being greater than that which containeth that is to ſay, the foot grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the ſhooe, whence it falleth out that the ſhooes laſt a very ſhort while. I opened then mine eyes thither and bend my minde to this trade for that beſide the gaine it was
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108986:56"/>
the moſt eaſie. But as from my infancie my parents had taught me to rip, it was not poſſible for me ſo ſuddenly to change the habite which I had already, turned into nature, and ſo ſixe weeks paſt ere I could learne to ſet one right ſtitch. From this ignorance my Maſter tooke occaſion to diſdaine me, breaking ſome laſts on my head, to ſee if they could leave ſome impreſſion beſide the continuall abſtinence with which hee puniſht me, ſome of his friends having ſaid to him that it was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular remedie———and quicken my wit. This life ſeemed not good to me nor to bee deſired, wherefore I reſolved to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it, and lay out for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108986:57"/>
another more peaceable, knowing particularly in my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe ſome motions of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, which inclined me to things higher and greater than to make ſhooes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude with my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſearch all meanes poſſible to bring me into the houſe of ſome man of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and rich, being aſſured that with the faire conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and readineſſe that I had, my ſervice ſhould be well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to my Maſter. Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reſolution was good, and the thoughts honourable and noble; but ſo lame, maime and without force for want of meanes, and apparell to ſet them forward ſeeing that it is moſt certaine, that if with my hands waxed, my apron and other markes

               <p>This difficultie held mee ſome few dayes in perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie without knowing how to enter upon my enterpriſes, notwithſtanding making a vertue of neceſſitie, being vexed at the miſerable life which I led, I determined to draw Phyſicke out of the diſeaſe, and honie from the Bees ſtings, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to revenge my ſelfe on the Spainſh lether and all ſhooe-makers. To this effect there came a notable bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in my mind, yea and profitable enough and ſure, if fortune who then was my enemie had not over-thrown
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108986:58"/>
my deſignes and my inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I conſidered that if I ſtole any thing out of the houſe, my ſhift ſhould have beene diſcovered in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and I as a ſtranger and friendleſſe, beene ill dealt withall, particularly, with the hatred which my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter bare towards me, &amp; the harſhneſſe with which they are wont to puniſh houſhold thefts in <hi>France.</hi> So riſing on Fryday morning earely than I had beene accuſtomed, rubbing my hands with waxe and alſo my face, I went with my apron girt to mee, and my hands all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawbed, to runne through all the ſhops of the towne, eſpecially thoſe that were beſt acquainted with my Maſter, and telling to every
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108986:58"/>
One that were in the ſhops, that the Gentleman ſtaid at my Maſters for a paire of bootes of the eights, to put them on incontinent, I asked for one boote to trie if it would fit him that deſired them. None made any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie to give me it, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that a man could not be ſerved with one boote alone, otherwiſe the moſt part of the ſhooe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers knew me, and theſe who had never ſeene me were in a minute ſo well ſatisfied with my preſence, that if the firſt finder out of the trade had come, they could not have given him more credite. With this inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I went almoſt through all the ſhops of the towne, ever heeding to aske for a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108986:59"/>
boote of the ſame ſize, and laſt that the firſt was of: And the invention fell out ſo to the purpoſe, and with ſo great eaſe that in halfe an houres ſpace, I gathered me then two hundred bootes all of one ſize, and of one faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which having tied up in a ſacke, I laid them on my ſhoulders and betooke me to the way. The fact lay dead without ſuſpition almoſt two houres, but ſeeing that I came not backe againe, nor returned the boots which I had carried away, nor tooke that which I had left, all of them ſuſpected that which truely fell out. And ſo this time being paſt, moe than a hundred apprentices were at the doore where I dwelt, every one asking for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108986:59"/>
his boote, which my Maſter and ſome few of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who loved mee not very well, ſeeing they told the Iuſtice, who dividing themſelves through the three gates of the Citie, met mee not very farre from one of them, becauſe the weight of my burthen ſuffered me not to get out of ſight as I could have wiſht. They brought me backe to the towne, and proceeding againſt mee for the fact yet hot and freſh in minde, they condemned me to walke foure houres through the accuſtomed ſtreets (that is to be ſcourged) with three yeares baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the firſt Theefe that was in the world and whence theft had its beginning.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough this noble Art had no other excellency but the antiquitie of its beginning and the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the firſt finder out thereof, it might ſuffice to the end that every good wit ſhould approve it for to be the moſt Noble of all thoſe which are practized at this day in the world, the firſt inventour thereof was one of the faireſt Angells that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108986:60"/>
was, whoſe beautie, dignitie and greatneſſe was ſo extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and high, that the moſt curious of his perfection found no other title more proper to exalt him than that of the Morning Starre, Governour of the dawning of the day, the Sun's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour. This then was the firſt Thiefe that was in the world, or before the world, if it be true that the Angells were created before time, who overcome by an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deſire, adventured raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to robbe God of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But hee was degraded becauſe Iuſtice tooke him in the fact, and ſeazing upon all the goods that hee had, condemned him to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall priſon, and together with him all his aſſociats.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:108986:61"/>The ſecond Thiefe that ever was in the world was our firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> as bold as the Angell, yet not ſo blame-worthie for being not ſo malicious in his ſin, and of leſſe knowledge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I cannot be perſwaded that hee was ignorant of the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which he owed to his Creator, having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge infuſed in him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe overcome by the importunate reaſons of his wife, and tormented with an ambitious curioſitie hee was deſirous to ſteale the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſedome of God. But it fell out as badly to him as to the Angell, ſo that his fleeing and hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſerved him to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the Iudge having asked him, and he not being
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108986:61"/>
able to deny the fact, for that he was taken in the fault, his ſtate of innocencie and originall juſtice was taken away, he and all his race remaining condemned to ſpend their life with ſweate, travell and miſhaps, and his wife to bring forth her children with ſorrow. And if you aske mee why God did not equally puniſh theſe two theeves, being guiltie of treaſon, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving attempted one and the ſame kinde of theft which is the divine perfection. It was to this purpoſe that I have heard ſpoken by a great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour and Preacher of the Church; becauſe if God had puniſht man with the ſame rigour that hee puniſht the Angell withall, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108986:62"/>
an intire nature, ſeing that all men ſinned in <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; ſo the world had remained imperfect. But in puniſhing the Angell, this inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venience followed not, becauſe many other Angels remained in heaven, and all the nature of Angels ſinned not, and this is the cauſe why God was not ſo ſevere to man as to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: but you ſhal better learn this curioſitie from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who knoweth it better than I do. It is ſufficient that thoſe aforeſaid Theeves were the firſt that brought theft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to credit in the world. And wee cannot ſay, that pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and neceſſitie ſtirred them vp to ſteale, becauſe the firſt was the nobleſt and mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all the Angells, and the ſecond was the firſt of all
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108986:62"/>
men, King of the living creatures, and abſolute Lord of the earth. From thence is brought in the deceite which to the day, this world ſeeth, beleeving that poverty was the finder out of theft, ſeeing it is riches and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, becauſe the love &amp; deſire of honour and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches groweth ſo much the more as it is increaſed, as a Poet ſaith very well. Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being an unſatiable fire, in which how much more wood is laid, ſo much the more it is inflamed, and a Dropſie, in which the more one drinketh, the more hee thirſteth. Even ſo in thoſe great theeves, the great riches and proſperitie which they had, was the cauſe of their unruly appetite, and unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108986:63"/>
ambition, for that they deſiring that which they had not, they could not attempt any other theft, but the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and wiſedome of God, ſeeing they poſſeſſed all the reſt. Whence you ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that to ſteale and robbe is in a ſort naturall to man, and that it goeth by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and propagation in all the linage of men, and not by cunning. For if it be true that we all are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, his ſin being nothing elſe but to robbe God of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it is evident, that there is in vs an inclination, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and naturall deſire to robbe and ſteale. From <hi>Adam</hi> this profeſſion was extended to all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, being alwayes kept on
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108986:63"/>
foote amongſt the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and beſt qualified of all his children. So <hi>Cain,</hi> as jealous of this originall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, would needs ſteale from his brother <hi>Abel</hi> the grace and particular favour with which God received his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and ſacrifices. <hi>Iacob</hi> cunningly rob'd the bleſſing from his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> and it went well with him. <hi>David</hi> the wife of <hi>Vriah. Achab</hi> though himſelfe a rich King ſtole <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard. And finally <hi>Nimrod</hi> by theft ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all the Inhabitants of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> And if leaving theſe and other Theeves almoſt innumerable, which holy writing relate unto us, wee take the examples that humane hiſtories rehearſe unto us, we ſhall ſee that this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108986:64"/>
ſingular Art hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſerved among the Nobilitie, ſith <hi>Paris</hi> ſtole <hi>Helen,</hi> raviſht before that by <hi>Theſeus;</hi> The ſame <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſtole <hi>Ariadne,</hi> and <hi>Iaſon Medea.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> of whoſe policie and good government <hi>Plutarch</hi> maketh honorable mention had this laudable and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cuſtome of ſtealing, and hee that was moſt cunning and ſubtile in that Art, was in greateſt account and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation amongſt them. The very mothers taught their children, while they were but little ones, to ſteale, holding it for an infallible point of policie, that they could never be good and brave ſouldiers, if they had not beene cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and well experienced

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108986:65"/>
who would not imitate the Nobilitie in their thefts. Whence and from the little diſcretion and exceeding great boldneſſe that then was amongſt people, it was one time ſo diſdained and diſliked that thoſe who did openly follow it, were puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſhamefull paines and accounted infamous. But as all things of the world have their contrary weights; time would needs finde a remedie for this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, ſeeking meanes to ſteale without puniſhment, and ſo diſguiſed, that not only theft ſeemed not vice, but was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a rare and ſingular vertue. To this end many brave ſpirits invented the diverſitie of Offices and charges which to this day are

exerciſed in the world, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of which ſerveth for a maske or cloake to make his harveſt and inrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with another mans goods. And to the end that you may not judge my words raſh, nor my propoſition too bold, runne, I pray you, over all ſtates that are in the Common-wealth, and you ſhall finde that wee all are the children of <hi>Adam.</hi> For I thus argue. That man that hath an Office of a thouſand Crownes of rent, without any other living, penſion or patrimonie, &amp; holds a houſe for which hee payes eight hundreth Grownes a yeare, keepes a horſe &amp; two Pages and a footeman, his wife and two waiting Gentlewomen, his children and a Maſter to

               <p>The Begger ſtealeth telling a thouſand lyes to him that giveth the almes, ſaying that he hath bin robbed, that he hath beene ſicke, that his father is in priſon, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting himſelf lame, with

which hee pulleth from men their almes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the difference and variety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Theeves.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll the Theeves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid are called diſcreete, becauſe that every one in his place ſtriveth to cover theft the beſt hee can, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it into Nobilitie and vertue, and this manner of ſtealing is the ſafeſt and moſt ſecret. Of theſe there is as great varietie and difference, as there are ſeverall Offices in the Common-weale, yea there are other Theeves who
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108986:74"/>
ſteale openly and without maske: who, although they are not ſo many in number as the former, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding moe, and their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences are as many as there are inventions to ſteale, which being redacted into a ſhorter number, are divided into Rob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers, Staffadours, drawers of Wooll, Grunets, Apoſtles Cigarets, Dacians, Mallets Cut-purſes, Satyrs, Devont, and Governours of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Robbers ſteale upon the high wayes and ſolitarie places with great cruelty and tyrannie, becauſe that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doe they robbe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out killing, fearing to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and followed by juſtice. The meanes &amp; ſlights that they have to coine to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108986:75"/>
their purpoſes are diverſe: for ſometimes they will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a man fifteene dayes never loſing the ſight of him, waiting while hee goe out of the towne. And the better to over-reach him one of the companie goeth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed in a Marchants habit, a gueſt of the ſame Inne, with a certaine packe of old cloth, or ſome other inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, giving to underſtand that he is a ſtrange country Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and feareth to travell alone. With this lye he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into diſcourſe with the poore Marchant or paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger craftily getting out of him, that which hee deſireth to know, &amp; learning whence he is, whether he goeth, what Marchandiſe he carrieth, or what buſineſſe he goeth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108986:75"/>
and when he is to be gone, whereof giving notice to his companions, they lye in waite for him at ſome place moſt convenient for their purpoſe. Others make themſelues lurking holes behinde ſome buſhes, growne up to the thickneſſe of a wood, and when they perceive a far off, or by ſome ſpie, a paſſenger, they lay in the middle of the way a purſe made faſt, ſome ſhew of money, or a little bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, that in the meane time while he alighteth and ſtaieth to take it up, they may come timely enough to take from him that he carrieth. Others being hid in the moſt ſecret places of the high way, ſend one of their companie in Carriers clothes, who ſeeing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:108986:76"/>
the Paſſenger approach ſtayes to looke on him, and making ſhew to know him and to have ſome letters for him, &amp; holding him in talke, buſieth him in ſuch faſhion, that the others have the time and meanes to ſurround him. Others lying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of the way, faigne a lamentable and pitifull voyce, with which they tye the paſſenger to ſtay, and to goe ſee what it is, and while he that makes this moane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully declareth his griefe, the ambuſh leapeth out that ſtrippeth him to his ſhirt.</p>
               <p>Your Staffadours are a ſecond ſort of robbers, little differing from the former, though more courteous, and not ſo bloudy; thoſe goe calmely into the houſe of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108986:76"/>
ſome Marchant, and not finding him there, ſeeke for him at great leaſure, at the Exchange, in the fields, at Church, and in the middle of a thouſand people, drawes neere to him ſoftly talking in his eare, making as though hee would communicate to him ſome buſines of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and ſhewing him a Dagger, ſaith, this Dagger demandeth a hundreth crownes, brought to ſuch a place, ſuch a day, and if you doe it not, you ſhall die for it. The poore Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſore affrighted by ſuch words dareth not to miſſe, for feare to be killed.</p>
               <p>The Wooll-drawers take their name from the theft they practiſe, which is to ſnatch cloakes in the night,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:108986:77"/>
and theſe have no other cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſave the occaſion: they goe ever by threes or foures betweene nine or ten a clock at night, and if they do finde a fit opportunitie they let it not ſlip. Moſt commonly they come forth to ſnatch cloakes in the darkeſt and raineſt nights, and to them places which they ſee is moſt quiet and moſt out of the way, at leaſt upon the one ſide, to the end that the neighbours may not come forth (at the outcryes and noiſe which the robbed are commonly wont to make) and take them. Theſe ſame are accuſtomed ſometimes to go in Lackeyes clothes to come in to ſome Maske or feaſt, making ſhew to looke for their Maſters, and with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108986:77"/>
this liberty, they meete with a heape of cloakes, that the Gentlemen uſe to leave in the Hall, being ſure that no body will meddle with them they in the view of all in the place, nimbly take up two or three on their ſhoulders, and get them gone with them; ſaluting all thoſe whom they meete, with Cap in hand.</p>
               <p>The Grumets take their name from the likeneſſe that they have to thoſe young boyes in ſhips, who clime up with great nimbleneſſe, by the tacklings to the top of the Maſt; and the ſailers call them Cats or Grumets. Thoſe that beare this name ſteale by night, climing up lightly, by a ladder of ropes, at the end of which they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108986:78"/>
have two little hookes of iron, to the end that throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up to the window; it may catch hold there and they eaſily get up and empty the houſe. Theſe runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſtealing not onely gold and ſilver, but alſo Wheate, Rye, Barley, Oates, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally all that ever they doe finde, and when they have plaid their prize, they cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly tye a line made faſt to the point of the little hookes, which, after they are come downe, they drawing, the two hookes are raiſed and the ladder falleth, without ever leaving any print or marke of the theft.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles take their name from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe that even as hee beares the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108986:78"/>
keyes of Heaven, ſo alſo they ordinarily carry a pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke or vniverſall key with which they open all manner of doores, and becauſe of too much noiſe, that the locke may not rattle, and awaken the people a ſleep, they put in a plate of leade with which they breake it in peeces, ſo that they who lie neereſt can perceive nothing.</p>
               <p>Thoſe whom they call Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garets, have for their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar office to haunt Churches feaſts and publique aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, at which they cut off the halfe of a cloake, caſſock ſleeves, halfe a gowne, the quarter of a jumpe and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatſoever they finde, for of all theſe they make money.</p>
               <p>The Devout are Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:108986:79"/>
theeves, becauſe there are no Eaſters, Pardons, nor Iubilie which they viſite not: they are continually on their knees in the Monaſteries, — having their beades in their hands, to cloake their knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, waiting their time, either under ſome Altar, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde ſome table, on the eeve of ſome ſolemne feaſt, to the end that they may get out by night.—and to ſpoile the image of all the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about them. In this ſort of theft they do more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over adventure into the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries of the Religious as well as into other Churches, becauſe that as they are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, and feare to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted diſorderly, they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome put a theefe into the hands of juſtice, and for all
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108986:79"/>
the miſchiefe that hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a man getteth out of their hands, chaſtiſed with one onely diſcipline all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Cloiſters by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Monks who charge him; after his amendment, to feare God.</p>
               <p>The Satyrs are men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wilde in the fields, that keepe their holds and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Countrey and forſaken places, ſtealing horſes, kine, ſheepe and all kinde of cattle which by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion come in their walke.</p>
               <p>The Dacians are cruell, mercileſſe people, held in our common-weales in leſſe account than th'other theeves: theſe ſteale children of three or foure yeares old, and breaking their armes and legges lame and disfigure
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108986:80"/>
them, that they may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſell them to Beggers, Blinde folkes and other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds.</p>
               <p>The Overſeers of the houſe have this name fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the particular care that they have to looke out for proviſion of bread, meate, and other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls to feede their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and as there is not any thing in the world that a man loveth better than to eate and drinke, the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and meanes that theeves have, are ſo ſeverall and ſo exquiſite that it is impoſſible to tell them all. Some are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed three or foure to meete in the twilight at night and taking a bottle of five or ſixe pottles with a fourth part of water in it, they goe to a Taverne bidding
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108986:80"/>
them fill the bottle with the wine in the houſe, and having agreed for the price, the poore Vintner beginneth to meaſure while it be almoſt full, then they make ſhew of a deſire to taſte it, if it be the wine that they bought at the beginning, and ſcarcely have they taſted it when bending their browes, caſting up their eyes and wrying their noſe they cry out at the wretched Vintner, ſaying that he is a theefe and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, who hath changed them their wine. The poore fellow ſeeing that his oathes and curſes availe nothing, is content to take his wine again and to take out the bottle the meaſures that hee had put in, by which meanes they have a fourth part left ſo well ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:108986:81"/>
that it may paſſe for wine of ſixe pence a quart. Other whiles they goe five or ſixe in companie to the Taverne with two great pots ſo like th'one to the other, that very hardly can there any difference be perceived betweene them; they carry th'one emptie and the other full of water under his cloak, and biddes them fill the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptie one with the beſt wine that they have, never taking care for the price, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full, the one of them takes it under his cloake, and the other ſtaies reckoning with the Vintner, holding his purſe in his hand and making ſhew to pay him: being upon theſe termes, the others come in, and aske alowd whether or no they ſhall ſuppe there,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108986:81"/>
which the Vintner ſeeing, allured preſently by the gaine that hee ſhall make if they ſuppe at his houſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them to ſtay, and they take his counſell determining to goe to the Cookes to buy ſome joynt for ſupper, and to call backe the reſt of their comerads, leaving the pot full of water to the Vintner, that he may keepe it in the meane while till they come backe, with which he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth contented and well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, thinking hith himſelfe, that though they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, the pot notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhall remaine with him for his gaines.</p>
               <p>As for the proviſion of fleſh, poulterie and other things they have a thouſand inventions, whereof I will
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:108986:82"/>
tell you one only which hapned long agoe to one of my copſemates. It was, if I rightly remember, on a holy Saturdayes market, in which they ſold great ſtore of Hennes, Partridges, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, Pullets and other things againſt the feaſtivall day. Three of the company went out to ſeeke for proviſion, dividing themſelves every one to his owne walke, the two met with a Countrey-Clown loaded with Capons and Partridges, which were in the market; one of them drew neare to buy up all that he had, &amp; cheapning a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre with the Clowne, agreed to give him ten Nobles for all his ware, giving it to his fellow to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it home, and he ſtayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108986:82"/>
with his hand in his pocket, making as if he would pay him. He ſearcheth both the ſides, of his hoſe, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out firſt a great purſe, next a little one, afterwards a hand-kerchertyed in knots with ſome papers folded up, with which he inchanted the Clown, and gave his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion time and leaſure enough to get him out of fight, and at laſt not finding in all his budgets the whole ſumme, he bids the Clowne follow him and he ſhould pay him. The Clown was content, and beginneth to follow him with diligence, and almoſt on the trot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that as my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had an intention, to get out of ſight croſſing the ſtreets and lanes he walk't
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108986:83"/>
a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pace with poſting ſpeede. But ſeeing himſelfe ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed by the Clown he went into the Cloiſter of the <hi>Auſtin</hi> Friers, where there were ſome Friers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing folkes, and having made a devout prayer, hee turned himſelfe towards the Clown, ſaying to him, My friend, the proviſion that you have ſold me is for this Houſe, and that Father, who is there a confeſſing is the Proctour, I will goe tell him that he muſt pay you; and ſpeaking thus, he comes to one of the Confeſſors: with the Clown after him, and turning a little aſide hee put ſixe pence into his hand, and whiſpers him in the eare ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Father, this country man is one of my acquaintance,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108986:83"/>
and commeth hither to be confeſt, he lives ſixe miles hence, and he muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie goe backe to his houſe this evening, I beſeech you to do me the favour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him out of hand and let him goe. The good Father obliged by the almes given aforehand, promiſt him, that when hee had ended the penitents confeſſion whom he had at his feete, hee ſhould diſpatch him preſently. With this anſwer, he called to the Clown, and ſaid to him, friend, the Father will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch you by and by, when he hath made an end of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing this man, to which the Father added goe, not hence, I will give you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent preſently. With theſe words my companion parted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:108986:84"/>
from them, and the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtaid, reckoning on his fingers the money that hee ſhould lay out on ſhooes, hat and other trifles which hee minded to buy as well for himſelfe, as for his familie out of his Poultry money. The penitent makes an end of his confeſſion, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes a ſigne to the Clown to draw neere; the Clown was not in ſo trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a perplexitie, with ſo great haſt as thoſe who come to confeſſion, which the good father was much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at, it ſeeming to him that he had little devotion and leſſe humility to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. The Clown ſtood bolt upright, looking heedfully upon the Confeſſor, to ſee if he ſhould put his hand in his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108986:84"/>
pocket, and the Confeſſor look't upon the Clown in like manner, aſtoniſht to ſee him ſtand with ſo little devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Notwithſtanding excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him becauſe of ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie which is ordinarie to theſe Country people, hee biddes him, kneele. The Clowne at the beginning made ſome reſiſtance, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be an extraordinarie ceremonie for one to kneele to receive money, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe at laſt he did it though grumbling. The father bids him make the ſigne of the Croſſe, and ſay his confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereat the Clown loſt all patience, beleeving the Confeſſor to be out of his wits, and ſtanding up begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to mumble within his teeth and to ſweare with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:108986:85"/>
great obſtinacie. This aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Confeſſor that the Clown was poſſeſt with a Devill, and having made the ſigne of the Croſſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to conjure him, putting S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> girdle about his head, and ſaying ſome devout prayers, with which the Clowne went out of his wits, taking the good Father by the ſurplis and caſting him down upon the ground, demanding aloud mony for his poultry. The father ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that hee had all the fiends of Hell together upon him, beginneth to ſay, the Letanie with a weake and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted voyce, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelfe to all the Saints in the Almanacke, praying them to aid him. At the clamour and noiſe, the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108986:85"/>
whole Convent began to be troubled, all the Monkes comming out in proceſſion with the Croſſe and the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtickes, caſting holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on every ſide, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that there was a Legion of Devils in the Church, They came thither where the Confeſſour was at debate with the Clown, who ſtill was asking money, for his Poultry, &amp; the Prior having asked the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſour concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this accident &amp; having alſo heard the Clownes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the juſtice of them both was diſcover'd with my Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions wicked deede. In the end ſome devout perſons who were in the Church, paid the Clown his monies who went backe contented unto his houſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Cut-purſes are the commoneſt Theeves of our Common-weale, who have an endleſſe deale of meanes and wayes to ſteale. All their ſtudie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in thruſting their hand in the pocket of whom they approach, and cunningly to draw his Purſe from him (he not perceiving it) with all
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108986:86"/>
that hee hath in it. Theſe haunt the Churches, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Faires, Aſſemblies &amp; publicke meetings, that they may worke their feate in the throng, he that takes the purſe gives it preſently to another that is by him, that if he ſhould be taken with his hand in his pocket, he might prove them lyars and cleare himſelfe before all the world.</p>
               <p>I will tell you a wittie tricke which I once plotted, though it fell out but badly by me, ſeeing that the heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, with which you hearken to me, makes me know that you are not wearie to heare me. The laſt yeere there came to <hi>London</hi> a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of <hi>Italie,</hi> rich, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and of good carriage,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:108986:87"/>
who being in rouled by our ſpies I tooke the charge upon me to deale with him. I roſe that day betimes in the morning, leſt I ſhould loſe the occaſion, and after I had dog'd him through many ſtreets, Lanes and Churches (for he was veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a good Chriſtian) wee came to a crowd of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants wont to be kept in the Exchange about eleven a clock, ſeeing him alone, I came to him, talking to him of a bargaine very profitable &amp; certaine, which made him open his eyes, and liſten heedfully to my reaſons. Then ſeeing him thus fitted to my inventions, I winded him gently into a Maze of difficulties, in ſuch ſort, that I never ceaſt to declare to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108986:87"/>
him the buſineſſe, nor he to learne the circumſtances. My Camerade then drew neare making ſhew as if he knew me not; and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to interpret the traffick for him which I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, whereupon the Marchant began to take no more heede to me, and I to thinke evermore of him. I put ſecretly my fingers in his pocket to try the depth and breadth thereof, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it and its Maſters little care gave me free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to put in all my hand. I did ſo and at the firſt eſſay, I drew his purſe, at the ſecond a ſilver Watch, which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried tied to a ſmall gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaine, with which I might have bin content if ſtealing could be limited. I was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:108986:88"/>
to try the third time, to ſee if I could draw thence a Holland hankercher, which before he had ſhewed edged with curious bonelace, but I could not be ſo nimble to draw it, nor my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to hold him in talke, but he felt me, and running to ſave his pocket with his hand he could not miſſe but meete with mine, wherewith being vext and ſuſpitious, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently knew that he had loſt his purſe and his Watch, and not finding them he tooke me by the necke, crying A theefe A theefe. I foreſeeing the evill that might befall mee (for <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for a Theefe) had given the purſe and Watch from underneath my cloake to my companion, as ſoone as ever
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108986:88"/>
I had drawne it, who was but only two ſteps from me: Wherefore with the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that I had, that he would finde about me that which he ſought, I ſcorned all he ſaid, giving him the lie a thouſand times. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant holding me faſt by the coller, with a loude voyce calling for his purſe, in ſuch fort that he made all upon the place to gather together. But my Camerade ſeeing that my honor runne a great hazard, if the buſineſſe ſhould be proved amongſt ſo many people, ſecretly calls a crier who was at a corner of the place, whom he made cry, If any one had loſt a purſe and a ſilver Watch, that he ſhould come to him, &amp; give true tokens therof, he would
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108986:89"/>
reſtore them, and withall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the place. Hardly was the ſound of the firſt cry heard but my good <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> let me goe, intreating me with great humilitie to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him the raſh judgement conceived of me, which I did at the requeſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, and preſently got me out of ſight. He went as nimble as a Roe to ſeeke for the cryer, and having found him he gave the true tokens of his loſſe, but he that had bid him doe it could not be found any more; and ſo I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped this dangerous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>The Duendes a <hi>Larins</hi> ſo called for the likeneſſe that they have with the ſpirits of this name, begin to walke through the towne in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108986:89"/>
evening, and finding ſome doore open, they enter ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hiding themſelves in the Cellar, in the ſtable, or in ſome other dark ſecret place, to the end they may throw out at windowes all that is in the houſe, when thoſe within are faſt a-ſleepe. I adventured once to play ſuch a pranke, and turne my ſelfe in an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of darkeneſſe, but I was deceived. It fell out then, that one night on the Eeve of a high holy-day I went to ſeeke my fortune, my miſhap made me meete with a doore halfe open, into which thruſting my head I ſaw that all my body might enter, I went up a paire of ſtaires to a great Chamber well furniſht and fitted, and thinking that it was a ſafe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108986:90"/>
courſe for me to hide my ſelfe under a bed, while theſe of the houſe were gone to reſt, I did ſo. After foure houres that I had laien all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on the flower, I heard a noyſe of folks, comming up ſuddenly into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, you neede not aske if I was heedfull to ſee who they were, and by and by with the light of a Candle I ſaw the feete of two footmen and one maide laying the cloth with great diligence, and were making of a fire, becauſe the Maſter of the houſe was to ſuppe there. The table furniſh't with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry diſhes of meate, foure or five ſate downe, beſides the children that were in the houſe. I was then ſo affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and confounded, that I
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108986:90"/>
thinke verily if the noiſe of their voyces and the great number of children had not hindred them, they might have heard plainely the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of my joynts, becauſe my buttockes beate ſo hard one againſt the other, that I thinke the noiſe might have bin heard halfe a mile off. By miſchance there was a little dogge, that runne about gnawing the bones that fell from the table, and one of the children having thrown him a bone, a Cat that watch't under the table was more nimble to catchit with which ſhe run away to hide her under the bed, the dog grinning and preſſing to take the bone from her, but the Cat could ſo well uſe her clawes and defend her prize,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108986:91"/>
that having given the Dog on the noſe two or three blowes with her paw, there began ſo great a skirmiſh, and there was ſuch a hurly burly between them, that one of the waiters tooke a great fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhouell that was in the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and caſt it ſo furiouſly under the bed, that if, as it gave me over the noſe with the broad ſide, it had lighted on me with the end, it had kill'd me out-right. The blow was ſo great, that I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove halfe an houre ere I could come to my ſelfe, but it made the Cat come out like a thunder from under the bed, and the Dog ſtaied grinning and barking with ſuch a fury that neither faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor threatning of mine could quiet him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108986:91"/>
the waiters at table were ſo vext that they began to chaſe him out, throwing fire-brands at him, which made him come out from under the bed, and leave me there in the pangs of death. The Dogges noiſe was done, and there began another in my guts, ſo violent, that to ſtay the ſudden rumbling of a flux in my belly, which the apprehenſion and feare had moved I was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſneeze thrice, &amp; with the force of my ſneezing to wrong my breeches by the liberty of that unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Theſe two noiſes met together, and making one of two, increaſt ſo much the force, that it made all at table riſe, and take off the Candles, to fee what was this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108986:92"/>
novelty. They pulled me out, but I could give no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that could be heard, nor humble ſuing that could be admitted, ſo I remained ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the rigour of their vengeance, they ſtript me ſtarke naked and binding me hand and foote, they began to ſcorch me with a lighted Torch not without loud laughing, and after they had ſatisfied their furious paſſion, they put me in the hands of Iuſtice, out of whoſe power I eſcaped ſigned and ſealed.</p>
               <p>The Mallettes are a ſort of theeves who hazard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon great perills and inconveniences, for they are made up in a bale, basket or dry fat, faining that it is certaine Marchandiſe ſent over, which they make ſome
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108986:92"/>
one or other of their friends in Marchants apparell carrie from one houſe to another, that when night commeth and every one being faſt a ſleepe, he cutteth the cloth with a knife, hee breaketh forth to empty the houſe. I was one of thoſe when the fourth diſgrace befell me, becauſe a friend of mine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving counterfeited to have foure bales to be laid by night in a rich goldſmithes houſe, counſel'd me to be pack't up in one of them, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the ſides thereof with cloth and webs of fuſtian. The goldſmith made no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie to receive them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as he had not them in keeping but a little while, and that he thought, if the owner in the meane time
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:108986:93"/>
ſhould happen to die, ſome one of them might fall to his ſhare, ſo he made them to be laid in his backe-ſhop, whereby I was well aſſured to worke my feate. I wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted while night with ſuch deſires as that plot deſerved, which notwithſtanding fell out to my diſgrace; for three or foure prentiſes meeting that night in the houſe, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to tarrie there upon occaſion of the bales, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to lay them together, and lye upon them. After ſupper, every one withdrew himſelfe. The prentiſes fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the unhappy bed, or to ſay rather, the bale, in which I was in the middle of the others, on which they began to ſleepe ſo ſoundly, that one might have drawne them a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108986:93"/>
mile and never awakened them. I being impatient of the exceeding great weight that I felt, not daring to ſtirre my ſelfe more then I had bin dead; and on the other part the little breath that I had, being choaked, I began to ſtirre my ſelfe a little, and ſeeing the unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable weight of that which was on me; I certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that they had layd a bale upon me; with which imagination, and the extreme anguiſh that I ſuffred, I drew a ſharpe knife, and thruſting it up, I made a great hole in the tillet of the bale, and a huge deepe wound in the buttocks of him that lay upon me. Hee roſe like a thunder raiſing his voyce to the heavens, calling for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108986:94"/>
neighbours helpe and the Iuſtices aide, thinking that ſome one of his companions would have kill'd him. The confuſed noiſe of all the neighbours, and the alarum was ſo great, that ere the Maſter of the houſe had ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a candle, the Iuſtice beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the doore came in, and finde the poore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fellow in his ſhirt bleed and faint, and the other vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confounded, takes the depoſition of him that was wounded never taking notice of the bale, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neere it, thinking that it was not needful to know the place where hee was hurt. But the goldſmith, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively hearkened to the Iuſtice, and beheld the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the fact, ſeeing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108986:94"/>
the poore-hurt fellow all bloudie, ſuppoſed that the bales and the cloth in them might be bloudy and ſpoil'd and he bound to pay them, and with this unquietneſſe he came neere to looke on the bale, and ſeeing it cut thruſt in his fingers to trie if nothing was ſpoil'd, and he miſt not to finde my bearde. I could very well have bitten him if I had thought it had bin the beſt of my play, but I lay quiet, thinking that he would never gueſſe what it was. He held the torch nigher to the hole, and ſtooping to ſee that he had touch't, the waxe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to melt and drop upon my face, which forced me to remove a little, and him to marre all, crying aloud.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108986:95"/>
Theeves, Theeves. The Iudge came neere, who was yet making one write the depoſition of the hurt man, and opening the bale, they found one within it. They carried me to priſon, whence I came out at the ſeventh day after at a cartes taile well accompanied, beſide other favours that they did me, whereof the greateſt was to condemne me to the gallies.</p>
               <p>All the aforeſaid Theeves have ordinarily their ſpies at Exchanges, Faires and common Markets, viewing all that goe and come, and learning what money they carrie, how much, and in what ſort, where they leave it, and in what hands, to give notice thereof to the companie.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou may thinke, I had no great maw to that journey, which theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen commanded me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Marſeils,</hi> ſith there could be no pleaſure in that which is done upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. Nevertheleſſe I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed with great reſolution, hoping that fortune would offer ſome good occaſion to ſet me at libertie: ſo all my
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108986:96"/>
ſtudie and care was onely to finde out the means to attaine to this end. And having tried many which came to no effect, he practized one which might have hapned well, if fortune had bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with my paſt troubles, and had not made mee fall any more in the tryall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The invention then was on this wiſe. The Captaine of the Gallie, where I was ſlave, being exceedingly in love with a Lady of good ranke, and ſhe in no wiſe loving him, hee tried all meanes (though impoſſible) to bring her to his bow, and as is uſuall with Lovers to be the more inflamed when they finde their beloved hard to be won, the Ladies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme coldneſſe was burning
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108986:97"/>
coales to the Captaine, in ſuch ſort that he never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed reſt but when he was talking of his love. I having got knowledge by the report of a ſlave that went daily to my Maſters houſe, there to carrie water, wood, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries, determined to try my fortune, and not loſe the occaſion. So I ſpake him kindly, promiſing him that if he would faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ayde me, that he might hope aſſuredly for his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereof I would as well make him certaine as of mine own. The good <hi>Antony,</hi> (for ſo the ſlave was called,) put ſo much truſt in my words, hearing me ſpeake of libertie which I had promiſt him, that waited but for the houre to be employed in that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108986:97"/>
which I did intreate him, and he thought there was not time enough; hoping with great impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that I ſhould declare to him that which he was to doe for me: who ſeeing him ſo well minded on my behalfe, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſillie, faithfull and true, I ſhewed him my reſolution, recommending to him ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and wiſedome above all things. I ſaid thus unto him, My friend <hi>Antony,</hi> know that it is long ſince I have deſired to impart a ſecret to thee, which I will tell thee of: but as all things require wiſedome, patience, and the occaſion, I have not done till now; becauſe I thought it not fitting till now to do it: as alſo, becauſe not being ſo ſatisfied (as I am this preſent)
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108986:98"/>
of thy goodneſſe, ſeeing, as the Proverb ſaith, one ſhould eate a buſhell of ſalt with his friend ere he truſt him. Thou knoweſt well our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters love with this Lady that dwelleth by the great Church, and how much he is out of kelter for her, yet never having received one favour of her, after ſo long time ſpent in her ſervice, and ſo many Duckets ſpent in vaine for love of her. Now if I ſhould finde a meane and aſſured invention, to make him without the ſpending of one ſhilling, or troubling her doores enjoy his pleaſure, what reckoning would the Captain make of this ſervice, and what reward would he give him who ſhould beſtow on him that which he ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108986:98"/>
deſireth? Verily (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Antonie</hi>) I hold for certaine that he would turne foole at his contentment, and not only would he give thee thy libertie, but alſo to all thoſe for whom thou ſhalt aske. Go to friend, ſaid I, if thou haſt any particular acquaintance with ſome one of them who are moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and beſt liked in the Captaines houſe, thou muſt acquaint him with this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, that he may tell him, and aſſure him that I will doubtleſſe doe that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and I counſell thee that it be not delayed. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent which <hi>Antony</hi> received was ſo great, that without bidding me farewell, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering me one word, he went from me like a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108986:99"/>
intreating a ſouldier of the Gallie, that he would bring him into the Captaines houſe, to talke with him of a matter of great importance. He was there, and could give order for my buſineſſe, that halfe an houre after, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the houſe came to the Maſter of the Gallie, charging him to ſend me with a ſouldier to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, becauſe he would ſee me. The quicke effect which <hi>Antonies</hi> diligence wrought, gave me extreme great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and made me hope that ſo good a beginning would bring my deſignes to a happie end. Finally, I was at my Captaines houſe, tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard, torne, and naked, and with a great chaine tyed to my foote. He comming to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108986:99"/>
meete me, as if I had bin a man of great ranke, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hand upon my ſhaven head, began to talke kindly to me, asking me what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man I was, what was my name, and why I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Gallies. And I having anſwered him in a diſſembling manner, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt I could, he drew me aſide, to a corner of the Chamber, asking if that which <hi>Antony</hi> had promiſt him, was certaine, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I him, I know not what he hath ſaid, nor what promiſe he hath made, yet I will tell you, that if he hath ſpoken according to that which I told him, all is true, without failing one tittle. Sir, I told him, that if you would promiſe to releaſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108986:100"/>
me out of this diſtreſſe which I indure, and to give me my libertie freely and wholly, I ſhould make you injoy the love which you deſire with ſo great paſſion and which ſo torments you, I promiſe you moreover and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that making this condition with you, if I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme not my promiſe you ſhall my head cut off, or throw me into the ſea. Thou bindeſt thy ſelfe greatly (ſaid he with a ſmiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, alreadie deſirous to ſee the effect of my promiſe) but if thou art a man of ſo great knowledge and skill, that thou canſt doe this for me, this Gallie wherinthou art ſhall be thy fortune, for I ſhall not onely be content to give thee thy libertie but
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108986:100"/>
I will make thee one of my houſhold ſervants, and the beſt reſpected of them all. But tell me, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner canſt thou doe it? Sir, you ſhall know (ſaid I) that I was bred with a great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer,</hi> who under pretence to caſt <hi>Horoſcops</hi> and Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties diſſembled his Magicke with ſo great craft, that there was not any one in the world that ſuſpected him. He made uſe of me in ſome of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call experiences, ſuppoſing becauſe I was young and of a dull wit I would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing of the ſecrets of his Art. But he was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, becauſe though I ſeemed fooliſh and ignorant, yet I had an eye on all his tryalls, and I ſtudied them ſo well, that many love ſecrets
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:108986:101"/>
ſtucke in my memorie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which I have one moſt certaine and approved, with-which if a woman were harder then the <hi>Adamant,</hi> I will make her ſofter then the waxe. In ſuch ſort that the ſecret which I propound to you is Magicall, not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and it is requiſite to have ſome haires of the party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, to put it in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; with which, and with ſome Ceremonies that muſt be performed, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans heart will be ſo ſet on fire, that ſhe ſhall take no reſt, but when ſhe is with or thinketh of her beloved. Notwithſtanding this muſt be done in the night, at the waxing of the Moone, and in the fields, there being but only three in the companie,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108986:101"/>
and theſe ſtout and reſolute, that cannot be diſmaied nor frighted, fall out what may, or whatſoever they ſee. If, ſaith the Captaine, that to further the buſineſſe there needeth no other thing but a good heart, we ſhall eaſily have our deſire, for though all Hell ſhould ſtand before me, it were not able to make me give backe ſo much as one ſtep, nor once to change my colour, or countenance: and for the haires that thou haſt mentioned, I will give thee as much as thou ſhalt deſire. I know Sir, (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I) by your face that your naturall inclination is very fit for Magicke, and if you had ſtudied it, you would worke wonders by it. So now ſeeing the time favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:108986:102"/>
us, and that you have the Ladies haire, let us not ſuffer this waxing of the Moone to paſſe with bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our buſineſſe to paſſe. You may goe out on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and he alſo that ſhall accompanie you, as for me, though ill beſtead with the weight of this chaine, I will not forbeare to goe a foote. All ſhall be in readineſſe (ſaith the Captaine) againſt thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night, &amp; ſith experience hath made thee Maſter in this Art, prepare thee well and ſtudie that which thou oughteſt to doe, to the end that our deſigne may not be loſt by negligence or little care; and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent get thee backe to the Gallie; for I will ſend to thee by the governour of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108986:102"/>
my houſe who ſhall be the third of our companie, a faithfull man, couragious &amp; valiant, and if there neede any thing to this purpoſe, thou maiſt in the meane time provide thee, for I will take order that all be paid that thou ſhalt buy. With this good anſwer I parted from my Maſter more joyfull and merrie then the flouriſhing Spring ſeeing my buſineſſe thrive ſo well at ſo good a paſſe, and being returned to the Gallie I found my good <hi>Antony,</hi> who waited for me with great impatience to know what I had bargain'd with the Captaine, and upon what termes my affaires ſtood, to whom I related all that we had agreed upon, and the kindneſſe that he received
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108986:103"/>
me withall in accepting my promiſe, aſſuring him that when I was in favour, the next thing I asked ſhould be his libertie. Hardly had I begun my diſcourſe, but I perceiued the Governour of the Captaines houſe entring the Gallie, his viſage infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, his eyes ſtaring and danſing, and he running, as he had quickeſilver in his heeles, asked where I was, and having perceived me, and drawne me aſide, he ſaid to me, I am Governour of the houſe to the Captaine of this Gallie, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to come hither, and to know of thee all that ſhall be neceſſarie for the buſineſſe that you talked of, diſpoſe and appoint at thy pleaſure, for I have money
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108986:103"/>
for all, and becauſe that I may offer thee ſomething in my own behalfe, take this crown of gold which I give thee as a token of that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which ſhall be between us, and I aſſure thee that thou ſhalt have a good friend of me at the Captains hands. But as reaſon would thou muſt anſwer me with mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all acknowledgment, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome thing for me. You ſhall binde me much Sir, (I anſwered him then very humbly,) having diſparaged your ſelfe ſo much in regard of him, who is ſo farre une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall: conſider in what my weakeneſſe and my povertie can ſerve you, for I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it with all my ſoule. I will not, ſaith the Governor, that thou hazard thy ſoule,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:108986:104"/>
becauſe it is Gods, but I would faine intreatthee, that with thy ſecrets and thy skill thou wouldſt helpe me to purchaſe the favour of a Gentlewoman of good ranke whom I have loved now theſe five yeares, and becauſe I am of ſomewhat a meaner condition then ſhe there is no meane to make her heare me and if it were poſſible to give two blowes with one ſtone it would be be an extreme great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me, &amp; thou ſhouldſt binde me to thee, not only as a friend, but as a ſlave. Now the Moone is waxing, and the time very fit, ſo that I thinke there is no neede to make any more ceremonies for my miſtreſſe than for the Captaines, and if you muſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108986:104"/>
have of her haire, ſee here are ſome, for it is above a yeare that I carried them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, keeping them as reliques. And drawing a paper out of his pocket put one of her locks into my hand. I who deſired no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but that the third of our companie ſhould be alſo ſo beſotted, that the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe might fall out well, I was in a manner beſide my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe with contentment, which I could not hide nor diſſemble without ſhewing ſome ſignes in my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of being troubled, by which he tooke occaſion to aske me what it was that troubled me. To whom I anſwer'd, Sir, I feare that if the Captaine ſhould know that I doe anything for you
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:108986:105"/>
he would be vexed with me, and I ſhould loſe this good opportunitie in which lyeth no leſſe then my libertie; this conſideration is that which troubleth me, not want of deſire to ſerve you. And who will tell it him, ſaith he then? The Divell, anſwered I, that never ſleepes, but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen what may, I am reſolved to ſerve you, though I ſhould loſe the Captaines good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, ſeeing it is the firſt thing that you have commanded me. As for that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the Captains buſines &amp; yours, you muſt buy a new ſacke, a ſmall corde, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other bigge one of Hempe, foure ells long, a new knife, a chaine and a bruſh, and theſe you ſhall buy without making any price, that is to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108986:105"/>
ſay, that you ſhall give for them whatſoever the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſhall aske without bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the price: and aſſure your ſelfe, that within a ſeven-night, you ſhall enjoy your love with great liberty. Thou giveſt me greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this anſwer, ſaith the Governour of the houſe, than if the King had given me a penſion of a thouſand crownes a yeare, doe that which thou promiſeſt, &amp; thou ſhall ſee what I will doe for thee. And embracing me kindly he went away full of hope and joy, leaving me the moſt contented man of the world, ſeeing that if in this priſon I had ſought an occaſon which might have fallen out better for my eaſe, it had bin impoſſible for me
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:108986:106"/>
to finde it, for as well my Captaine as the Governour of the houſe were ſo blinded beſotted and fool'd, that if I ſhould have call'd the day night they would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved it. On the contrarie my heart throb'd a thouſand waies, conſidering into what a maze I ſhould thruſt my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe, if the buſineſſe ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not, nevertheleſſe I made a vertue of neceſſitie, uſing that remedie which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie with theſe that are in any extremity, which is bold<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe and reſolution. With this good courage I waited for the Thurſday, which came more joyfull and fairer then the Spring, though it was ſlow, becauſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they had to injoy their Miſtreſſes, and mine to get
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108986:106"/>
out of the harbour by the cheating trickes that I put upon them, it ſeem'd to us the longeſt day of all the yeare. Every time the clocke ſtruck, they deſpaired, fearing to miſſe the telling of the houres, as theſe do who hope for a thing that they earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire; and after this care they were in anextacie conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what they would do in the poſſeſſion of their loves, as if they had alreadie verily paſt the night and overcome the difficulty. This doubting and hammering of theirs ſerved me well to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they might not perceive the gulleries that I put upon them, and the ſmoake that I ſold them. Whereby I finde that thoſe who paint Love blinde, have
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108986:107"/>
great good reaſon for them, becauſe that, if they not bin ſo, they would have percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all my promiſes to be nothing but winde, and that the meanes which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them were for no other end but to gull. them.</p>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108986:108"/>
enters the Gallie, brave, Gallant and clothed with the beſt apparell that he had, becauſe that amongſt other directions that I had given as well to him as to his Maſter, the chiefe was that they ſhould be fine &amp; brave, as being a thing moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſarie for Magick skill; and having ſaluted me with cloſe embracements he ſaid to me, friend, that thou maiſt know that I can doe what I will at the Captaines hands, and that I want not good will to help thee, thou ſhalt know that through my intreatie he gives thee leave to leave off thy chaine for this night, and it may be, for ever, that thou maiſt walke with greater libertie, and performe thy buſineſſe and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:108986:108"/>
what is neceſſarie for it, and though the Captaine made ſome difficultie, I dealt ſo earneſtly that I obtained this favour in earneſt of that which I deſire to do for thee. I who then was more knaviſh and more diſſembled then fooliſh, fell into ſome ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imagining that this libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie offered ere it was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was fained, and but only to try me, wherfore I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, Sir I thanke you for the care you have had of me obtaining of my Maſter that he will take off my chaine, a favour which I would kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept, if it were poſſible, but it is not, becauſe I muſt not change the eſtate that I am in, nor one point of that which is of my eſtate; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſarie that he, who
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:108986:109"/>
ſhall make this tryall, muſt make in the ſame eſtate &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell that he is accuſtomed to weare: and ſo I may not goe but in mine owne clothes &amp; with the chaine becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we ſhall do nothing. The Governour was not a little contented with my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, being aſſured that there was in me no kinde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite nor malice, but the pure and ſimple truth, &amp; pittying me beleeved aſſuredly, that there was more paſſion in my words then Iuſtice, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced me the ſecond time ſaying, friend, God who is wont to give the ſalve ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wound, hath brought thee to this Gallie, that by it thou mightſt come to the knowledge of my Maſter, and enjoy the ſpeciall
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:108986:109"/>
favours which thou ſhouldſt promiſe to thy ſelfe from his liberalitie, if the buſineſſe fall out well. How well? anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I him, hath the Captaine any ſuſpition that I would deceive him? No by the world anſwer'd the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſeeing that though thou wouldſt doe it, thou couldſt not: but it is the great deſire that we both have to ſoften the hardneſſe of theſe ſhe-Tygers, and to turne them to our love, that makes us thinke that impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible which is eaſie for thee to doe, and this is uſuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Lovers. I never was one, (anſwer'd I, and though I ſhould be more in love then was <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> I ſhould never perſwade my ſelfe that day were night, that oxen flie,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:108986:110"/>
and other fantaſticall imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that haunt Lovers, which rather may be called follies and idle thoughts then love-paſſions. It well appeareth that his darts have not ſtrucke thee, ſaith the Governour, for if thou hadſt tried them, thou wouldſt not have ſpoken with ſo great freedome and ſo little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Know friend, that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians ranke this diſeaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Melancholike paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, into which the diſeaſed falleth, beleeving that which is not, and framing a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand phantaſies and viſions which have no other ground but their perverſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt imagination, which workes the ſame effect in Lovers, giving them an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of jealouſe, to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:108986:110"/>
of diſdaine, to an other of favour, making a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of nothing, all which is bred of a burning deſire which they have to poſſeſſe that which they love. But to be willing to perſwade this unto him who hath not tried it, is to deſire to draw water with a ſive, and to weigh the earth. I am no Doctor, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Governour, I anſwer'd him, nor yet Batcehler, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being left yong, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and poore, I lived alſo without knowledge, having only foure words of Latin. Nevertheleſſe by the uſe of reaſon well knowen of all ſciences, I underſtood the ſmal reaſon that Lovers have to be ſo oft troubled upon ſo ſmall occaſion as they are troubled, becauſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:108986:111"/>
their affections tend to two points, to wit, that the woman muſt be good or evil faithfull or diſloyall. If ſhe be good, faithfull &amp; anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your affection in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall love, it is a great follie to be jealous over her: if ſhe be unfaithfull and known for ſuch a one, there needs no other counſel, but not to truſt her nor love her. Whence may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded that all the accidents to which you ſay lovers are ſubject, are the overflowings of follie, and wants of wit, it being a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table extravagancie to love one that hateth, this being ſuppoſed that hatred cannot be the ſubject of love, nor love of hatred, ſeeing we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily love them that bind us thereto by their love. If it
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:108986:111"/>
went by experience, ſaith the Governor thou wilt loſe thy cauſe, becauſe uſually they hate theſe that love them beſt, taking the ſight of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man for the occaſion of their hate, and it is a voice in them now a dayes turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a nature, to ſhun thoſe that follow them, and to abhorre thoſe who adore them, as the Captaine and I have hitherto made a long and unhappy tryall. Thinke not ſo Maſter Governour, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that you have made a good concluſion; for if you will have the patience to heare me, I will make you ſee clearely in what your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments faile, and know that love ceaſeth not to love nor hatred to hate, there being no law of nature, and he that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108986:112"/>
foſter'd you in this philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, hath fed you with bad milke, becauſe that Love alone not being accompanied with other circumſtances, which are to be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and reaſonable is not all the motive of an other love. That Princeſſe of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bloud ſhould be tyed to love a Porter, that dieth for her, onely becauſe he ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her. I deny your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſhe is no wiſe bound to doe it, nor her well to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect him, the object that might move her not being in him. As a Prince hateth to the death a poore damſell, becauſe ſhe depiſeth him, being unwilling to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his wanton love, whence it may be gathered that neither the Porters love
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:108986:112"/>
ſhall in any caſe tye the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe wil, nor Damſels ſcorne ſhall breed hatred in the Princes minde. Seeing that in love is found the good, the profit and pleaſure which are the hookes with which the will is taken, then it is the motive of love, and the Lady ſhal not be able to hate him, who loveth her upon theſe conditions, but therein being unequalitie and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſhe may do it. You ſhall more clearely perceive this in hatred, becauſe when a man dieth for a Gentle-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, &amp; ſhe hates him excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, this hate is not that which inflames his love, but the account ſhe makes of her honour &amp; the feare of ſhame if ſhe ſhould conſent to the pleaſure of him that loveth
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108986:113"/>
her, which conſideration makes her coole and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and him extreamely paſſionate. Whence it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the woman offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in hating him that worſhips her, nor any man ought to hate ſuch a woman that diſdaineth him. This thy Philoſophie, my friend, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Governour, is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of moe words than lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and I could refute it by plaine reaſons, if time did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us leaſure, but the houre is already come, &amp; the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine will looke for us, only I would intreate thee to be mindfull of me as a friend, making thy inchantment of equall power with the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Gentlewoman of whom I have ſpoken to thee. Away with this care, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerd
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:108986:113"/>
I, for I will doe it in ſuch ſort, that though your Miſtreſſe were harder-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; more frozen then the Alpes, ſhe ſhould be turned into a Mountaine of fire, hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile.</hi> I beleeve ſo, ſaid the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, but I cannot chuſe but wonder why thou being ſo cunning a fellow didſt not enchant the Iudge to be in love with thee and not have condemned thee to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. If this ſecret were good for a man, ſaid I, a hundred yeares a goe I had bin a Duke or a Governour of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, if I had not bin a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. It is not good but for women, becauſe he that firſt found it out, gave it this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue only. That alone ſufficeth me, ſaith the Governour, if
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108986:114"/>
with it I can ſoften that ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, but with the hope that thou haſt given me, I hold the victorie as certaine, and I hinder my ſelfe that I doe not ſee to morrow already. With theſe words we came to the other ſide of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour where my kinde Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain waited for us with great impatience and unquietneſſe, by whom I was very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, &amp; he asking me why the Governour had not taken off my chaine, as he had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, I anſwerd him the ſame things, which I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore anſwered the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, wherewith he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wel contented. They leapt both on horſe backe, &amp; I followed them at leaſure, becauſe of the waight of my chaine, and being about a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108986:114"/>
league from <hi>Marſelles</hi> we arrived at the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They lighted down, and tying their horſes at a tree, we with drew our ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether to the place where our tryall was to be made, &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them with ſome neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ceremonies, and telling them what they ſhould ſay, I made a Circle on the ground whiſpering I cannot tell what ſtrange and uncouth words, and turning my ſelfe often, ſometimes towards the Eaſt, ſometimes to the Weſt, with ſome ceremonies ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall, that they made the Captaine and his Governor of the houſe both of them aſtoniſht and fearefull. At halfe an houres end after that I had gone turning about like a foole, I made the Captaine
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:108986:115"/>
goe within it, charging him to ſay after me, who was ſo obedient and ſo forward to all that I would have him, that if I had then cut off his muſtaches, he would have beleeved that it was needfull for the inchantment. I made him ſtrip himſelfe, teaching him to ſay certaine words to every parcell of his clothes which he put off, which he pronounced ſo exactly that he loſt not one ſyllable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving that if he had miſſed in one jote he ſhould have marred all this buſineſſe, With this ceremonie I ſtript him to his ſhirt, he never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any ſhew of feare nor ſuſpition, being aſſured that he was ſafe enough by the preſence of the Governour, who was much aſtoniſht to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:108986:115"/>
ſee them finiſh'd, it ſeeming to him that there ſhould neither be time enough nor inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficient for himſelfe. Pitty ſo moved my heart that I could not take off his ſhirt, having compaſſion of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, becauſe it was then the coldeſt time of all the winter, and either through feare or cold, ſuch a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment quivering and ſhaking of all his joynts tooke him, with ſuch a chattering of his teeth, that the noiſe thereof might have bin heard halfe a mile from the place. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and encouraged him, with the ſhortneſſe and quick diſpatch of the inchantment, and the aſſured poſſeſſion of his love, injoyning him in the meane time to be ſilent, and telling him that if he
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108986:116"/>
ſpake but one word, we ſhould be preſently in leſſe then the twinkling of an eye all of us in <hi>Barbary.</hi> He then being in this plight, that is to to ſay, naked in his ſhirt, I gave him a knife in his hand, commanding him to make ſome ſtabs towards the foure quarters of the world, at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one uttering ſome words, &amp; for the concluſion I made him goe into the ſacke. That which I then ſaw with mine eyes was a wonder &amp; a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God, becauſe I alwaies imagined, that as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ſacke he ſhould ſuſpect ſomething, &amp; that all mine invention ſhuld come to nothing: but a little lambe is not more obedient nor more milde than he was, becauſe that without any reſiſtance
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:108986:116"/>
or ſhew of miſtruſt, he went in, being ſtill aſſured by the preſence of his Governour, and the ignorance he had of his loves; Which was good for me; for if he had known that the Governour was to be incha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted alſo, he had never gone into the ſacke. Finally having packed up the poore Captain, I laid him along up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground with his belly upwards, tying the ſacks mouth with a cord that was by me, &amp; ſpeaking ſtill to the Governor to encourage him, and wiſhing him to have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience a quarter of an houre the enchantment was to laſt. So having left him in this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the Governour and I went aſide about a ſtones caſt who ſaid to me in an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great pelting chafe, I wil
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108986:117"/>
lay a wager that thou haſt forgotten ſomething of my buſineſſe, for here I ſee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſacke nor knife for me, as for the Captaine. Here is no need of a ſacke, ſaid I, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your Magicall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are made ſtronger or weaker, according to the greater or leſſer cruelty that Gentlewomen have: and the Captaines being exceeding diſdainfull, I have made the enchantment of a ſacke for her which is the ſtrongeſt of all. Oh! brother, ſaith the Governor, what is this that thou haſt done? mine is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, diſdainfull a Tyger and a Lyoneſſe: for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taines, though ſhe loves him not, notwithſtanding ſhewes him ſome favour, and if it goes by diſdaine, we neede a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:108986:117"/>
hundred ſackes, not one only what ſhall we doe? Be quiet Maſter Governor, ſaid I then ſeeing him afflicted, for there is a remedy for all but death; for that which is not in one threed ſhall be in a hundred. I will make with the haires and the cords a hanke which ſhall have no leſſe force then the Captaines ſacke, and for as much as your Miſtreſſe is ſo cruel as you ſay, I wil adde thereto a ſmall matter which ſhall make her, that ſhe ſhall never be able to take reſt while ſhe ſee you. It is that which I looke for, my friend, anſwerd hee, let us martyr her in ſuch ſort, that my love may torment her thoughts &amp; her memory, &amp; performe my buſineſſe quickly, before my Maſters be ended. Speaking
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:108986:118"/>
thus we came to the roote of a tree, the place at which I had told him that his incha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be made, and in an inſtant making a circle, &amp; teaching him what he ſhould doe, I made him goe into it ſtarke naked to the skin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had neede of a ſhirt. Having him there in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, I tooke his Miſtreſſe haires, &amp; twiſting them with a cord I made a big roule, with which I tyed his hands to the ſtumpe of a tree, ſhewing him the myſterie that was hid in every ceremonie, &amp; I would faine alſo have tied his feete, if I had not feared that hee ſhould have ſuſpected this to be rather the fact of a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then of a Magitian, but as his hands were enough for my purpoſe I would do no
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:108986:118"/>
more. Finally having made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dumb naked &amp; bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſharpnes of the cold aire with the onely fire of Love, that burned in their heart, there was no body that could hinder me to give two or three knocks at the lock of my chaine with a hammer that I carried in my pocket and taking their horſes and clothes I got me out of ſight &amp;, being armed like another <hi>S.

So before that any fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out or vexing ſhould riſe between us, relying upon the kinde offers which a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had made me, making me underſtand, that not only her goods, but alſo her very life ſhuld be ſacrificed to my friendſhip; I requeſted her to pawn her chain or her Pearls for to contribute with her for the expences of the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, aſſuring her that I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for two thouſand Ducats from a living which I had in my country. But as they are old and ſubtle in their trade ſo they are alſo in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, and ſo ſhe excuſed her ſelfe, ſaying that the Pearles
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108986:122"/>
and the chain were pawns of a friend of hers who was to come and redeeme them the next day, and that her honor ſhould be greatly endangered if ſhe had them not in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. There needed no ſmall art to cover the annoy which that crafty anſwere bred me, nor little wit to turne into jeſt ſuch a plaine denyall. So without making any ſhew, or anſwering one word to that purpoſe, I fell a laughing moſt heartily over her ſhoulders, ſaying to her, that it was a device that I had framed to try her good will and to ſee if ſhe would indeede confirme that which ſhe had promiſt by her words, and drawing out of my pocket a counterfeit letter of Exchange, I made
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108986:123"/>
her reade it that ſhe might ſee the power that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me to take up eight hundred Ducats from a rich Marchant of <hi>Lyons,</hi> whom ſhe knew well, wherewith comming to her ſelfe from her rugged coyneſſe, ſhee fell againe into her ſmiling humour, giving me a few light blowes on my cheeke, calling me diſtruſtfull and mocker. I went away from her with a thouſand em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings, making her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that I was going to receive a part of that ſum, and God knowes what my heart was. But as povertie hath ever bin the mother of inventions, amongſt many others which my imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afforded me, I chooſed out one which was to ſell my
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:108986:123"/>
horſe at any rate whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being content only to have monie to live upon but three dayes, at the end of which I minded to have a fling at her Pearles, and ſo to get mee out of the way. But it happened quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to me; I went to catch the wooll but I came backe fleec't which was the juſt judgement of God, and a righteous puniſhment of my fault. For though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe ſaith, <hi>He that ſteales from a Theefe winneth a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares of pardon:</hi> yet the theft that is done to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this kinde, is not put upon this account. But it ſhould be rather held for a great offence, becauſe that for the monies they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they ſell their honor
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:108986:124"/>
and reputation which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be redeem'd withall the treaſures of the world. It came to paſſe then, that I returning in the evening to her houſe, and making my pockets jingle with the money that I had received for my horſe, ſhe met me with embracings, ſo ſmiling and kinde, that with her fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and flatteries, ſhee made me almoſt beleeve, that the refuſall ſhe had made me of her Pearles, had beene but a tryall and proofe, which ſhe would make of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Finally order was given for making ſupper ready, with which and the tricks that I minded to put upon her, at the comming of my money, I reſolved to change her in ſuch ſort, that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:108986:124"/>
in her firſt ſleepe, I ſhould have the commoditie to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault her, and ſhee never to perceive it. But my deſires had not ſo good ſucceſſe as I thought, becauſe that ſuch women know more then the Devill, particularly ſhe, who as an old beaten bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame in her trade, there was no ambuſh nor deceit, which ſhee had not pried into. So the more I urged her to drinke, ſo much the more ſhee proved coy and backeward. Supper ended with all the joy that I could faine, and the hope which that good occaſion promiſt me, we withdrawing our ſelves into her chamber, ſhe began to untire her ſelfe with as much ſlowneſſe as it had beene her wedding night.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:108986:125"/>
But I deſirous to arrive at the haven of my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make her more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and leſſe ſuſpitious I went to bed firſt, faining my ſelfe unable any more to withſtand ſleepe that urged me ſo eagerly. My diſgrace was ſuch, that ſhee diſtruſting the ſumme, that I had bragged to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and taking occaſion by my dogges ſleepe ſhee would ſearch my pockets to trie if all was gold that gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd, and if the nuts were anſwerable to the noiſe. But finding there was ſo little monie that it would ſcarcely furniſh out the next dayes expence, ſhe began to be vexed and to have an ill opinion of me. At all this (though ſnorting) I was
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:108986:125"/>
more watchfull and more a hunting then a Cat when ſhe watches a Mouſe, ſpying in what place ſhe laid her Pearles, that I might fiſh them incontinent when ſhee was fallen aſleepe. She lay downe ſad and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, thinking on the ſmall ſumme of mony, that ſhee had found, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſighing. Whereof I would in no wiſe aske the cauſe, as knowing it well enough, and not deſirous to let her from ſleeping which I ſo much deſired and long'd for. So a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre after, which was the time that in my conceit, ſhee was paſt all thinking of it any further, I thought of mine owne deſignes, weighing well all
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108986:126"/>
the inconveniencies which might fall out, amongſt which I conſidered the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, conceived by her to be moſt difficult, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to me that ſhe would not ſleepe but by halfes, and that ſeeing the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of that ſhee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, ſhee would raiſe the houſe with her cryes, and put all the neighbours in armes. But amongſt many inventions, there came a ſubtle one in my minde, and moſt fit for the purpoſe to this fact, which was, not to hide the Pearles in any part of my clothes, but to ſwallow them one and one, being aſſured that having paſt them through my body they would come forth more cleere and bright then
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108986:126"/>
of before, and that in this manner though all came to the worſt, the Iuſtice would ſet mee free not finding the Pearles about mee. This thought, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeemed admirable good, and thinking that ſhe was aſleepe, ſeeing ſhee ſighed no more, nor ſhewed any more her unquietneſſe. I roſe as ſoftly, as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, going barefooted and at leaſure to the place, where ſhe had left her Pearles, and having found them, I began to ſwallow them one after another, though with ſome difficultie, I being narrow throated, and they very big. My ill lucke was that while I was, about to ſwallow the laſt, it ſtucke in my wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zand ſo unhappily, that it
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:108986:127"/>
could neither goe foreward nor backward, I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to cough with ſome violence, and to awake her with my coughing, ſhee calls upon me with teares and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſht, and I diſſembling the beſt I could the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of my weazand, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her that I was ſeeking for the Chamber-pot with which ſhee was well apaid for a while, though not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with my anſwer, it ſeeming a thing unlikely to looke on the cupboord for the Chamber-pot, which was uſually ſet under the bed, wherefore caſting with her ſelfe the meanes to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her ſuſpition, without making any ſhew of diſtruſt, ſhee counterfeited an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſore paine in her bellie
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:108986:127"/>
uttring great cries, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to her two maides that were in the houſe for light, and ſome warme clothes: ſhee held in her diſſembled paine for the ſpace of halfe an houre, ſuppoſing that would be enough to take from me the ſuſpition of her cunning ſlights. About the end of which, ſhee riſeth from bed like lightning, and looking round about the roome with a lighted candle and where ſhee had left her Pearles, and no finding them, without ſpeaking ever a word, or asking any other reaſon then what her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination perſwaded her, ſhe begunne to beate her face with her fiſts, that inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſhee fill'd her mouth with bloud, uttering after
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:108986:128"/>
that loud and ſhrill cryes, that in leſſe then a quarter of an houre, above two hundred people were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and amongſt them the Iuſtice, who breaking open the doores of the houſe, came up furiouſly, finding me in my ſhirt, and her in her night attyre, with her haire about her eares and her face ſcratcht, calling to me for her Pearles moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. The Iudge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that every one ſhould hold their peace, that hee might be inform'd of the fact, and take the depoſition of us both, and hee having begunne with me, I gave him content with very humble words, ſo that neither his threatnings nor intreaties could draw any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:108986:128"/>
frome me. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Iudge ſeeing the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans vehement complaints and bitter teares charged that my clothes ſhould be ſearch't which was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that hardly a moate of the Sunne could have beene hid in them, and they not finding there the Pearles all of them with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord judged mee to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and condemned her as ſubtle, ſhameleſſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled. She ſeeing then that they all ſpake againſt her, and miſregarded her complaints, caſt her ſelfe downe at the Iudges feete, tearing her haire, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her clothes, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ſtrong cryes, that the Iudge knew not what
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108986:129"/>
to thinke, nor what reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take, and conſulting of the matter with thoſe he brought with him, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it having beene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified that ſhe had the Pearles when ſhe went to bed, they ſhould be ſearched for, in all the moſt ſecret corners of the Chamber, they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found, they ſhould ſend for an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> that ſhould give me a potion mingled ſtrongly with <hi>Scammonie,</hi> to the end that if I had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, I might caſt caſt them up againe. The Iudges ſentence was put in execution, and having done their diligence propoſed about the Chamber, and not finding the Pearls, they were forced to come to the laſt remedy, which was the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108986:129"/>
they which forced me to take in full health without the Phyſitians appointment, and againſt my wil, &amp; though I did all that was poſſible for me to vomite them, there was no meane to make me doe it, ſo a vehement ſtrife being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened in my guts I was compelled to give way to the Pearles, and to tarry my ſelfe in priſon, enjoying the favours which theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Iuſtices are wont to beſtow upon thoſe that fall into their hands.</p>

hee anſwered joyfully in this manner. If God would have pleaſed that this ſhould be my laſt diſgrace, and if it had beene as ſoone ended as I ſhall end the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thereof I ſhould have thought my ſelfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie; but I dare not truſt to my hard lucke, becauſe that it being accuſtomed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute me, I do not beleeve that it will ever ceaſe to uſe mee unkindly with new tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Know then that the Iuſtice of <hi>Lyons</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned me in two hundred laſhes of the whip, through the ſtreets accuſtomed, for ſuch malefactours, and marking me with the towne marke, they baniſht me the towne with ſhame enough, allowing me but three daies
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108986:131"/>
only to diſpatch my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and goe into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: during which dayes I thought upon a thouſand fantaſticall diſcourſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking my ſelfe, how I might repaire the povertie that had overtaken me after ſo great abundance. And after I had bethought my ſelfe of a thouſand plots, never a one of which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me, the Divell put one in my head, which was the trouble that I now am in. I bethought my ſelfe that the ſame day that I was whipt, a famous Theefe came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, whom the Iudge had condemned to the ſame paine, a young man of good diſpoſition, and of a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courage, wittie, and one of the cunningeſt Theeves
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:108986:131"/>
that in all my life I had dealt withall, but unhappie as well as my ſelfe. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted my ſelfe with him to trie, if betweene two wretched Caitives we could finde ſome comfort in ſo great a miſhap, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating one with th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our intent and thoughts, we reſolved to make a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney together to <hi>Paris.</hi> But before wee were fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved of all things fitting for the voyage, we had a conſultation about our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie, and infamie, deſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the meanes which we might make in ſo great miſhap, and thinking it was not ſafe for us to embarke our ſelves in ſo great a citie as <hi>Paris,</hi> not having meanes to live on there, and by
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108986:132"/>
which to buſie our ſelves, at leaſt while wee were knowne. And after that he h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d given me the hearing a long while, and heedefully heard all the reaſons and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes which I propounded, he ſaid, Maſter <hi>Lucas</hi> (for that was the name which I had at <hi>Lions</hi>) the inventions that you ſhew me are good and worthy of ſuch a ſpirit as yours: but they bee hard and difficult queſtions. Wherefore leaving them for another occaſion, I will tell you one, which if it fal out well, it may well be that we ſhall get out of this miferie. This is that we may uſe diligence to finde in this Citie of <hi>Lions</hi> ſome Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant that hath trade and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence at <hi>Paris,</hi> from
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:108986:132"/>
whom wee may get a letter directed to his friend, and having found him, you ſhal tell him ſecretly, that you will make up ſome packes of Marchandiſe in this towne to be tranſported to <hi>Flanders</hi> with ſome mony, and leave all at <hi>Paris</hi> in the hands of ſome ſure man, that it might be kept ſafe, while you go to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where you ſhall make as if you have a Cozengermane, to trie the price, and how your Marchandiſe may be paſt off; and that having never beene at <hi>Paris,</hi> nor made any acquaintance to whom you might recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your packes, you ſhall intreate him to write to ſome Merchant of his friends, that hee may keepe them
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108986:133"/>
for you. For ſo much, I ſuppoſe, hee will not refuſe you, and if he agreeth to it, let me alone. You ſhall ſee how I will rule my hands? If that be all that hinders you, ſaid I, I will finde them that ſhall give me a thouſand letters, and not one only though I am now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, and with infamie yet bleeding, I would have you to know, that there was moe than foure that will doe ſomewhat for me, and that this is true you ſhall ſee by and by. With theſe words I went from him, and going to a Marchants houſe of my acquaintance, asking of him a letter, after the forme that my camerade had told me, with which I returned exceeding content,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:108986:133"/>
and putting it into his hand, he kiſſed it a thouſand times, praiſing my diligence and credit, and ſo at laſt we came to <hi>Paris</hi> with it, where wee being retired to a Chamber of the ſuburbs, we made two Packes, with ſome pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of coorſe canvaſſe, the reſt full of ſundry things, ſuch as old ſhooes, old clothes, ragges, and ſuch other wares, and my Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade put himſelfe in the third, wherein I packt him up ſo neately and handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that neither his Packe nor the other two ſeemed to be nothing elſe but cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots or Fuſtians. Our Packes being made up, I went to give the letter to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to whom it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, who received it moſt
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:108986:134"/>
gladly offering me all his houſe. After this wee agreed that I ſhould ſend the Packes at eight a clocke at night, to ſave the cuſtome other dues to be paid by the Marchants, amongſt which entred that of my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if not full of camlots, yet at leaſt of cords, ladder, hooke, file, lantern, knife and other militarie tooles, with which to make war for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, and robbe the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants mony. He then being entred and all in the houſe aſleepe, becauſe it was paſt eleven a clocke he ſlit the canvaſſe with a knife, and comming out hee ſearch't all the corners of the houſe, throwing out at the windowes ſome apparell and ſilke gownes with that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:108986:134"/>
ſeemed to him to be of the leaſt, which I gathering up in the ſtreete with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, the Divell would have it, that the watch in the meane while came by, with ſo great ſilence and diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that they gave me no leaſure to hide our boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which I was gathering up, nor to betake my ſelfe to the flight. And as there was no great neede of queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mee for to know my cops-mates, ſith theſe wares could not fall from heaven, they perceived that my Camerade was above, whom, after they led mee to the priſon, they impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned alſo for the ſame crime. He went out a fort' night agoe, being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Gallies for ten

is governed, &amp; with this law our captain ruleth the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe, who come newly unto him, beſtowing on him the office &amp; maner of ſtealing according to the diſpoſition that hee hath taken notice of in him in the months of his novice-ſhip.</p>
               <p>This Captaine is an old man, wiſe, well experienced &amp; finally exempted from the trade, as being one whoſe force and nimbleneſſe having failed for the practize, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth the Theorie with us teaching us the method and precepts of ſtealing. To which end he makes us meete together once aweeke in a certaine place appointed for the purpoſe, where hee bindeth us to give a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all the thefts and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108986:138"/>
that have happened therein, reproving ſharply thoſe who are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and prove vnprofitable, prayſing the vigilant and ſubtle. This is done ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily on Saturday night, on which day he appointeth all that muſt be done the weeke following, ſharing out to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one the places that he ſhold keep in, &amp; the thefts in which he ſhuld be emploied, taking of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all a ſtrict oath of faithfulneſſe, &amp; puniſhing the offenders, the firſt time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging him of that part of the theft which belongeth to him, the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d depriving him of the place of ſixe moneths, and if he be incorrigible and ſtubborne, he puts him into the hands of the Marſhall. If hee falls in a fault by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:108986:139"/>
negligence &amp; careleſneſſe, as it may be by comming tolate to his place, to go elſewhere, or let ſlip ſome occaſion in not laying hold of it, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of a weekes benefit, &amp; taking from him the office of a Theefe, he puts him in the office of a Spie, or of a watch-man, for the time that our Councell ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
               <p>Of all thefts in the firſt place is allotted the fifth part to him, that ſpares the whip to us, baniſhment, the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the Gallowes, and that which remaineth of the tenths for pious uſes, which are, to ſuccour the ſicke and needie of our companie, to releaſe priſoners, and to eaſe the diſgraces of thoſe that have no monie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:108986:139"/>We receive no women in the companie, unleſſe it be in caſe of great neceſſitie, and when it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, becauſe by nature they cannot keepe ſecrets, &amp; they being unable to eſchew this inconvenience we are bound upon great paines not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale unto them, how, from whom, and when wee have ſtollen.</p>
               <p>He that commits the theft hath equall ſhare with the Captaine for paines &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that hee hath put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in, his complices have the third part, and the Spies the fift.</p>
               <p>As for the honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which is due to every one, there is ſuch an order kept, that no wrong is done to any one of the companie,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:108986:140"/>
every Officer having his ranke and place appointed in all our meetings, aſſemblies and conſultations.</p>
               <p>For the firſt are the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,<note place="margin">See Cap. 7.</note> next the Stafadours, then the Grumets, after theſe the Hobgoblins, then follow the wooll-drawers, the Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets follow them, and laſt the Apoſtles, Cigarets, Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſes, and Caterers.</p>
               <p>Over all theſe a kinde of Theeves beareſway, called among us Liberalls, whoſe office is to undertake ſome ſtrange points, as to blacke their faces with inke or ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell durt, to hang Garlands of hornes at mens doores, libells or ſuch like, and theſe are the wittyeſt of all the company, and thoſe who as it were indued with the beſt
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:108986:140"/>
wit and invention, weigh and foreſeeing all the difficulties that can happen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous caſe.</p>
               <p>None of the companie may make any quarrell, noiſe or contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, about any matter what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, unleſſe it be fained or ſubtle, to avoide any ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that may be offered.</p>
               <p>We may not eate twice two of us together in one and the ſame Tavern or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailling houſe, except it be once in the ſev'night, to th'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end that if any thing come in the way to be ſtollen there we may breede no ſuſpition amongſt them that ſhould ſee us there.</p>
               <p>We are forbidden alſo to go together through the city or to ſpeake familiarly one to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:108986:141"/>
another, unleſſe it be to fall a quarrelling, &amp; to make ſome falſe blowe at one another, to draw people together, that upon the occaſion of our quarrell the Cutpurſes may make up their hand.</p>
               <p>Every profeſſor of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie carrieth his badge and ſecret marke, by which he is in an inſtant known of us all, underſtanding by this order, how many there are of an office in every ſtreete &amp; part of the town. So the Robbers beare alwaies a glove handing and made faſt by one finger. The wooll drawers button<note place="margin">Cap. 7. ibid.</note> their doublet by interceſſion that is to ſay, they button one and miſſe the next. The Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fadours ſtroake their muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and their beard at every ſpace, ſometimes thruſting
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:108986:141"/>
their finger into one of their noſtrils. The Cut-purſes have a little white marke in their hat-bands. The Malletes<note place="margin">ibids</note> beare their cloake after a certaine faſhion, and finally every particular office hath its particular token by which it is known among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>When any woman of the companie is married every profeſſion gives her five Crowns to augment her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, keeping nevertheleſſe ſuch an order, that ſhe may not be married but to one of her owne trade; that is to ſay, the Daughter of a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with a man of the ſame vocation or calling. And if by chance ſome Cut-purſe ſhould marrie his Daughter with a Robber, Staffador or
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:108986:142"/>
Grumet, hee is bound to give him a hundred crowns in portion more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, becauſe his ſonne of Law is of greater and higher Office then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is.</p>
               <p>We make a vow of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſuffering, promiſing to be couragious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant againſt torture, though we be ſeldome put to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as I have told you) all that is ſalv'd with the fifth part.</p>
               <p>And to the end that all the places of the towne may be ſufficiently provided, it is enacted that every profeſſour that ſhall come newly to a place, ſhould put there ſome marke, ſhewing thereby the number of Theeves which are in that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:108986:142"/>
part: ſo the firſt that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth layth a die in ſome ſecret corner, and yet well known to thoſe of the companie, with the <hi>Ace</hi> turned upwards; The ſecond that commeth, turneth the die to the <hi>deuſe</hi> point, the third to the <hi>trey,</hi> the fourth to the <hi>quater,</hi> and ſo the others to the <hi>ſiſe,</hi> and being come to that number, the ſame Office ſtayeth in the ſame place, becauſe that according to our lawes we cannot be above ſix in one and the ſame place: and when any one goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he turnes the die upon the number of theeves that remaine, in ſuch ſort, that they being ſix, the firſt that goeth away turnes the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:108986:143"/>
Die to the cinque point, the ſecond to the quater, the third to the trey, by which number he that is behinde of the Theeves is knowne.</p>
               <p>We are bound to nouriſh and ſuſtaine all the creeples, blinde, ſick, and thoſe whom their extreame old age ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth from ſtealing.</p>
               <p>None of us may weare cloake, hat, breeches, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet nor any thing elſe that was ſtollen, nor ſell gold, ſilver or jewells in that towne where they were ſtollen, under paine of a great and exemplarie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p>Wee are commanded to carry alwayes a falſe beard in our pocket, with plaiſters of ſundry ſorts, to diſguiſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:108986:143"/>
us in an inſtant, when occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall require. As concerning Religion wee are halfe Chriſtians, becauſe that of the two principall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of Gods Law we keepe one, which is to love God; but in no caſe our neighbour, becauſe we take from him that he hath.</p>
               <p>Next we receive and allow of the two parts of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which are Confeſſion (becauſe now and then we confeſſe) and Contrition: but of the third, which is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or reſtitution wee not ſo much as make mention, or talke.</p>
