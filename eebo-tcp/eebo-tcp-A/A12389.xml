            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>¶1. Nowe when Ieſus entred and paſſed through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo,
2. Beholde, there was a man named Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,
which was the chiefe receiuer of the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
and he was rich. 3. And hee ſought to ſee
Ieſus, who hee ſhoulde be, and coulde not for the
preaſe, becauſe he was of a lowe stature. 4. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ranne before, and climbed vp into a wilde
figge tree, that hee might ſee him: for hee ſhoulde
come that way. 5. And when Ieſus came to the place,
he looked vp, and ſawe him, and ſaide vnto him,
Zaccheus, come downe at once: for to day I must
abide at thine houſe.</q>

               <p>Firſt therefore for the place where he was

not farre diſtant from <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> It was
ſometime a notable Citie, till it was ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the Lord of heauen and earth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth
to come, in the likeneſſe of a ſeruaunt.
And as <hi>Ioſua</hi> compaſſed <hi>Iericho</hi> ſeuen
times, minding to deſtroy it, ſo Chriſt the
true <hi>Ioſua,</hi> reſorted oftentimes to <hi>Iericho,</hi>
minding to ſaue it. But as in the deſtruction

conuerted none but <hi>Zaccheus</hi> the Publican.
When <hi>Ioſua</hi> had conquered and raſed <hi>Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi>

which is moſt plainlie and fully ſette

<hi>Zaccheus</hi> and his conuerſion, comes in with
an <hi>Ecce, behold,</hi> as if it were a wonder that
<hi>Zaccheus</hi> ſhold be conuerted. <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was
a Gentile, a Publican, and a rich man, and
<pb facs="tcp:18030:4"/>
therefore behold a miracle, as if in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
of <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> theſe three ſhould be
conuerted al once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was a Gentile, a meruaile to ſee
a Gentile become a Iew:<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 28.</note> that is, to belieue
in Chriſt. He was a principall Publican. A
ſtrange thing to ſee a chiefe Cuſtomer to
giue ouer his office: and he was rich alſo, a
rare matter to ſee a rich man to enter into
the kingdome of God:<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 23.</note> and therefore behold
a miracle, as if at this day, the Turck: the
Pope, and the King of Spaine, were at once
perſwaded to forſake their Idolatry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.
Chriſt going to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth
a Gentile, to ſignifie the calling of
the Gentiles: he conuerteth a Publican, to
ſhewe that notorious ſinners may hope to
be ſaued, if they repent and amend, as <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
did. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerteth a rich man, to ſhew
that all rich men are not excluded from the
kingdome of heauen,</p>
               <p>Hee was called <hi>Zaccheus</hi> before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion,
but he was neuer trulie called <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
till Chriſt called him ſo. His name
ſignifieng, ſimple, pure honeſt, but his lyfe
was ſubtile, impure, and moſt deteſtable.
Thus manie are called by honeſt names,
whoſe deedes bewray their diſhonest na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb facs="tcp:18030:4"/>
and vices oftentimes are ſhrowded
in the habites of vertue, like <hi>Eſops</hi> Aſſe,
masking in the Lyons ſkinne, till hys long
eares detect his folly; or like the Crowe
that is decked in other plumes, till euerie
byrd doe plucke his feather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zaccheus</hi> by his profeſſion was a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
and therefore much deteſted of the
Iewes: for Publicans were the Romaine
Officers, appoynted to gather and receiue
publique cuſtome or tribute of the Iewes,
who were at that tyme in ſubiection vnto
the Romaines. And amongſt theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<hi>Zaccheus</hi> was the chiefe, and (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth)
Ouer-ſeer of the reſt that where in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico,</hi>
and therefore in chiefe hatred among
the Iewes, as one that chiefely fauored the
Romans tiranny, and ſerued to abridge their
Country liberty, which ought not be ſubiect
to any Nation.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he contemned the ceremonies of
the Iewes, and regarded not their Religion,
nor liued after theyr Lawe, and therefore
with the reſt of the Heathen Publicans,
was excommunicate out of theyr Sinagogue

                  <note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> 18.</p>
               <p>Thus was he hated for his profeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was a Publican, &amp; for his religion,
<pb facs="tcp:18030:5"/>
becauſe he was a Heathen. Yet was hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued

                  <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was a Publican, and therefore
riche: for Publicanes muſte needes he rich,

               <p>As <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was deſirous to ſee Chriſt in

although with the eies of our bodie we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

ſo let vs be as carefull to heare the word

               <p>
                  <hi>Zaccheus</hi> is deſirous to ſee Chriſt, a godly
care, but yet hee coulde not obtaine his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
a thing common, for euerie one that
hath any good motion, hath alwaies ſome
hinderaunce to croſſe the ſame,<note place="margin">Two impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.</note> and <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
hath a double impediment to hinder
his honeſt enterpriſe: The preaſe of the
people, And his little ſtature. Whereof the
former, that is, the multitude, is alwaies
<pb facs="tcp:18030:7"/>
wont to be an enemie to thoſe that woulde
come to Chriſt. This hindered the blinde
man from receiuing his ſight.<note place="margin">Luke, 18</note> 
                  <hi>Luke,</hi> 18. for
the people rebuked him that he ſhould hold
his peace, till Chriſt called him and opened
his eyes. This hindered them that brought
the man ſicke of the Palſie.<note place="margin">Marke, 2</note> 
                  <hi>Marke,</hi> 2. for
they could not come at Chriſt for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaſe,
till they vncouered the roofe of the houſe,
and let downe the bed wherein the ſicke of
the Palſey lay.</p>
               <p>This hindered the healing of the deafe
and dumbe,<note place="margin">Marke, 7</note> 
                  <hi>Marke,</hi> 7. till Chriſt tooke
him aſide out of the multitude and cured
him. This hindered the raiſing of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
daughter.<note place="margin">Math. 9</note> 
                  <hi>Mathew,</hi> 9. till Chriſt had
thruſt out the Minſtrels and the multitude,
and then reſtored the maid to life. Finally,
this hindered <hi>Zaccheus</hi> here from comming
vnto Chriſt, till Chriſt vouchſafed to call
him to himſelfe. Thus alwaies a multitude
that is prone to euill, doth withdrawe and
hinder vs from approching vnto Chriſt: and
therefore wee muſt not followe a multitude
to doe euill, nor decline after many to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the trueth.<note place="margin">Exod. 23</note> 
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>The ſecond impediment that hindereth
<hi>Zaccheus</hi> from ſeeing Chriſt, is his little ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb facs="tcp:18030:7"/>
Hee was ſo lowe of ſtature, that hee
coulde not ſee Chriſt aboue the multitude:
but Chriſt was aboue the multitude, and
therefore coulde ſee <hi>Zaccheus</hi> though hee
were ſo lowe of ſtature. For God looketh
not on the countenance,<note place="margin">Sam. 16. 7</note> nor on the height
of a mans ſtature, but the Lord beholdeth
the heart, and preferreth little <hi>Dauid</hi> before
<hi>Eliab</hi> his eldeſt brother,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16 12.</note> becauſe he findeth
in him a better heart to ſerue the Lord. And
<hi>Zaccheus</hi> in his little bodie, hath a heart and
minde prepared to ſeeke and ſee the Lord.
<hi>Zaccheus</hi> was ſo lowe that he could not ſee
Chriſt, but many amongeſt vs are ſo high
that they will not ſee Chriſt. The common
people in the time of Chriſt, were ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to followe Chriſt, that neither lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
nor blindnes, nor ſicknes, coulde ſtaie
them from comming to him: but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people in our time, are more readie to
follow their ſport and paſtime, then to come
to the Church to heare of Chriſt. And as
for our rich men, who ſeeth not that they
will make great haſt to ſee a commoditie,
but will ſcarce come out of doores to heare
a Sermon?</p>
               <p>They come to Church,<note place="margin">Iohn, 32</note> as <hi>Nichodemus</hi>
came to Chriſt by night, as if they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
<pb facs="tcp:18030:8"/>
to come to Church: but they runne
after profite to gette riches,<note place="margin">2. King. 5</note> as <hi>Gehezi</hi> ran
after <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian to get a bribe.</p>
               <p>Thus hath <hi>Zaccheus</hi> two lettes, that hee
could not ſee Chriſt, the one in the people,
the other in himſelfe: and wee haue many
lettes to withdrawe vs from Chriſt, ſome are
externall and without vs, as the intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of the world, and ſome are internall
and within vs, as the luſtes of our owne
fleſhe. The preaſe of the people, hindereth
<hi>Zaccheus</hi> from ſeeing Chriſt in his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and the multitude of our ſinnes,<note place="margin">Eſay. 59. 2</note> doe
preſſe vs downe that wee cannot ſee Chriſt
in glorie. <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was a man of little ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that hindered him from ſeeing
Chriſt in earth, and we are men of little faith,
and that is the cauſe wee cannot beholde
Chriſt in heauen.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was a man of little ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet it appeareth that hee was not a
man of little wit: For when hee coulde not
come to the ſight of Chriſt for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
he had the wit to runne before, and to
clime vp into a tree to obtaine his purpoſe.
And for the moſte part it falleth out, that
men of lowe ſtature, are men of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite,
and the ſhorteſt bodies, haue the
<pb facs="tcp:18030:8"/>
ſharpeſt wittes, God ſo prouiding, that the
defectes of their bodies, might bee ſupplied
with the giftes of their minde. Nowe <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
that before was loth to moue his foote
from the Cuſtom-houſe for looſing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
beginnes to runne after Chriſt for feare
of a greater loſſe, like <hi>Eliſa</hi> that left his plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ranne after <hi>Elias</hi> to followe his
newe vocation.<note place="margin">1, Reg. 19</note> But <hi>Zaccheus</hi> doth not
onely runne, but alſo clymbe vp into a Tree
to ſee Chriſt: A ſtrange thing, that <hi>Zaccheus</hi>
a rich man, and a chiefe Cuſtomer, ſhoulde
behaue himſelfe ſo childiſhly in the ſight of
ſo great a multitude: but the deſire hee had
to ſee Chriſt, made him forget himſelfe, and
to commit ſuch thinges as were not fitting
for his ſtate and credite. So they that wil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Chriſt, muſt make account to doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
thinges contrarie to the<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 12</note> faſhion of the
worlde, and their owne liking. If Chriſt
himſelfe were content to leaue the glorie
which he had with his father to come down
to vs, ſhall not wee be content to leaue the
reputation which wee haue with men, to go
vp to him?</p>
               <p>But alas where is there any almoſt, that
preferreth not the fruition of this earthly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
before the poſſeſſion of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
<pb facs="tcp:18030:9"/>
manſion: and had rather hazard the
hope which they haue of eternall glory, then
leeſe the preſent enioying of theyr fading
pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The ambitious man hunteth after honor,
and will not leeſe an inche of his eſtimation.
The couetous man ſeekes after profit, and
counts (like <hi>Iudas</hi>) all loſt that comes not
to his bags. And the voluptuous man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes
his time in pleaſure,<note place="margin">Iohn. 12. 6.</note> and thinketh
that hys chiefe felicittie. Thus euerie man
makes his heauen of that wherein he moſt
delighteth, &amp; is content to take great paines
to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh his fond deſires. But here <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
is of another minde, for being a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
officer, he climbes into a tree, which
ſtoode not with his grauitie: and being a rich
man, he runnes to ſee Chriſt, which was not
for his worldly profit; yea hee takes great
paines to ſee Chriſt, not reſpecting his eaſe
or pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Thus muſt we be affected if we deſire to
come to Chriſt, that neither honours nor
preferments, nor profit nor pleaſure, nor
kyndred nor freends, be able to holde vs
backe.<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 22.</note> We muſt be readie not only to run,<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 26.</note>
but alſo to climbe (if need require) as <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
dyd: that is, to take ſome payne and
<pb facs="tcp:18030:9"/>
trauaile to haue a ſight of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Queene of the South,<note place="margin">1. King. 10.</note> vndertooke a
great and tedious iourney, to heare the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Salomon,</hi> but we are lothe to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
paine to heare one that is greater then <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people in <hi>Dauids</hi> tyme, brought ſo
much treaſure,<note place="margin">1. Chr. 29. 9.</note> and ſo many gyfts to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Gods Temple, that the Prieſtes were
fayne to byd them ceaſe, but a great part of
the people in our tyme, are ſo ſparing of their
paynes and coſt, that they thinke that very
time miſpent whiche is imployed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of God: and that money ill beſtowed,
which is gyuen to the maintenaunce of his
Miniſters.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Zaccheus</hi> could not ſee Chriſt for
the multitude, he climbes vp into a tree, that
groweth in the way where he was to paſſe,
that from a tree he might behold him, which
was to ſuffer on a tree for mans ſaluation. So
when wee cannot drawe neere to Chriſt by
reaſon of our ſinnes that preſſe vs downe, we
muſt clymb vp by a liuely faith, whiche is the
tree of life, that groweth in the waie to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, that ſo with the eyes of our fayth, we
may behold him that dyed for our ſinnes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a tree.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18030:10"/>
It was a wilde figge tree that <hi>Zaccheus</hi>
clymbed,<note place="margin">Math. 21, 19</note> but not like that vnfruitfull one
which our Sauiour curſed: for this bare moſt
pretious fruite, euen ſuch as Chriſt himſelfe
vouchſafed to plucke. A happie tree that
bare ſuche pretious fruite as <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was,
but thriſe happie <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> that ſo happily
clymbed on that happie tree.</p>
               <p>This tree grewe in the way that Chriſt
was to paſſe, for elſe <hi>Zaccheus</hi> might haue
climbed to no purpoſe: So if wee deſire to
finde Chriſt, we muſt ſeeke him in the waie
where hee hath promiſed to ſhewe himſelfe
vnto vs, that is, in his holy Temple, where
his word is duely preached,<note place="margin">Math. 18, 20</note> and his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
reuerently adminiſtred, for where
two or three are ſo gathered together, hee
hath promiſed to be preſent amongſt them.</p>

               <p>As <hi>Zaccheus</hi> ranne before to ſee Chriſt,

was, becauſe otherwiſe, it had been
vnpoſsible for <hi>Zaccheus</hi> to come to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:
for vnleſſe the Lorde vouchſafe to

                  <hi>Chriſt looked vp and ſaw Zaccheus,</hi> before

Thus doth the Lord preuent vs with his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,

Somtime wee flock together to heare a
Sermon,<note place="margin">Luke. 5</note> like the people <hi>Luke,</hi> 5, that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
vpon Chriſt to heare the word: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none
wee runne to ſee ſome pleaſant paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
like the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 17</note> whoſe eares al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
itched to heare ſome newes. Who
make more ſhewe of conſcience and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then they that ſhewe themſelues moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious
and vnconſcionable? Who ſeemed
more confident and vertuous in Chriſt hys
cauſe then <hi>Peter?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math, 26</note> and not long after, who
more trayterous and faint-harted.</p>
               <p>Many can ſaie with <hi>Peter,</hi> that they will
not ſtick to die before they will denye
Chriſt, but when it comes to the tryall they
are readie to abiure Chriſt and his religion,
before they will hazarde either life or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
               <p>He that will come to Chriſt, muſt come
at once, without delay, for delays (ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the matter of our ſaluation) are moſt
daungerous, &amp; repentance may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.
<hi>We muſt make no tarrying to turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccle, 5, 7</note> 
                  <hi>nor put off from day to day, leaſt
the wrath of the Lord breake forth ſudainelie
<pb facs="tcp:18030:12"/>
and we be deſtroyed in our ſecuritie and periſh
in the time of vengeance.</hi> When the Lord is
minded to doe vs good, he wil haue vs come
quickly like <hi>Ioſeph, Gene,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gene. 45</note> 45. 6. that in the
tyme of famine, would haue his Father <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
to come downe quickly vnto him, to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne
in Egypt, where there was ſome plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of foode.</p>
               <p>As the children of thys world are verie
nimble to worke wickednes, ſo the children
of light, ſhoulde be as nimble to followe
goodneſſe. <hi>Iudas</hi> was nimble to betraie
Chriſt, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13. 27. and the badde debters,
<hi>Luke.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh, 13, 27</note> 16.<note place="margin">Luke, 16</note> could ſitte downe quickly to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reckon
their creditor: ſo let vs come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to heare of Chriſt, that Chriſt may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of vs quicklie, let vs be nimble to make
our account before,<note place="margin">Luke, 14. 28</note> that we doe not (lyke
the fooliſh builder) come ſhort of our rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning.</p>
               <p>But why muſt <hi>Zaccheus</hi> come downe ſo
haſtily? euen to entertaine Chriſt into hys
houſe. <hi>For to day</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>I muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
with thee.</hi> This was ioyfull newes to
little <hi>Zaccheus.</hi> Not long before, he wanted
meanes to ſee Chriſt, but now he hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
to entertaine him into his houſe.
There was more humanitie in Chriſt then
<pb facs="tcp:18030:13"/>
in <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> for if Chriſt had not bidden
himſelfe to dinner, hee had not been bidden
for <hi>Zaccheus.</hi> So if Chriſt doe not offer
himſelfe vnto vs in his afflicted members,
hee may go long enough before we will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him any entertainment.<note place="margin">Math, 25, 40</note> As often as the
poore craueth anie reliefe at our handes, let
vs imagine that Chriſt asketh ſomething of
vs: but as <hi>Zaccheus</hi> muſt entertaine him
preſently without delay, ſo let vs be readie
to helpe them preſently, becauſe they ſtand
in neede of preſent helpe. And as hee muſt
receiue Chriſt into his houſe, ſo wee muſt
make account to receiue his needie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
into our houſes:<note place="margin">Luke, 16.</note> And as the vniuſt
Steward procureth himſelfe friendes with
his maiſters goodes, ſo let vs make the poore
to be our friendes, by our beneficence and
bountie towards them, that ſo receiuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(when they haue neede) into our earthly
houſes, they may receiue vs when we ſtand
in greateſt neede, into euerlaſting habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>They that were inuited to the marriage,
<hi>Math.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> 22. refuſed to come, but Chriſt is
content to come to <hi>Zaccheus</hi> houſe before
he was inuited. Wherein alſo, hee ſheweth
his great humilitie, in comming before hee
<pb facs="tcp:18030:13"/>
was requeſted, as they bewrayed their great
arrogancie, in refuſing to come beeing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely
bidden. It was a part of great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,
that he that was moſt free from ſinne,
woulde vouchſafe to come into a ſinners
houſe: but it was a ſigne of greater humilitie,
that he would be wray his great neceſſitie, &amp;
ſeeke for ſuccour at a ſinners hand.</p>
               <p>Alas poore humble Sauiour, who though
thou be Lord of heauen and earth, as thou art
the ſonne of God, yet as thou art the ſonne
of man, haſt not whereon to lay thy head,
<hi>Math.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 8.</note> 8. How iuſtly did thy Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
wonder at thy humble pouerty, ſaying.
<hi>O thou hope of Iſraell, the Sauiour thereof in
the time of trouble,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>why art thou as a ſtraunger
in the land, or as one that paſſeth by to tarry for
a night?</hi> The ſonne of GOD vouchſafeth to
come and that vnrequeſted, to a ſinfull mans
houſe, a ſpeciall fauour: but hee diſdaineth
not to make his neceſsity knowne vnto him,
O ſtraunge humilitie!</p>
               <p>Heere therefore appeareth the ſinguler
humanitie and great humilitie of Chriſt to
ſinfull men; he offereth himſelfe to bee their
gueſt if he finde them willing to entertaine
him for their gueſt. And <hi>Zaccheus</hi> no doubt
was willing to entertaine him: for although
<pb facs="tcp:18030:14"/>
Chriſt heard not the voyce, yet he heard the
affection of <hi>Zaccheus</hi> inuiting him to dyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
As therefore <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was willing to
receiue Chriſt into his houſe, ſo let vs be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to receiue him into our harts. For as Chriſt
ſayd to <hi>Zaccheus: This day I muſt abide at
thy houſe,</hi> ſo he ſaith to euery one of vs, <hi>This
day I muſt abide in your harts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">Pſalm, 24</note>
                  <hi>Open your gates that the King of glorie may
come in,</hi> ſo I ſay vnto you, <hi>Open your hartes
that the word of God may enter in.</hi> This daie
the word of God may abide in your harts,
for thys day the word is preached vnto you,
and who knoweth whether he ſhall liue to
heare it the next Saboth.<note place="margin">Pſal, 95</note> 
                  <hi>To day therefore if ye
will heare his voyce, harden not your hearts:</hi> as
did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelites, leaſt if you harden your harts,
his voice be heard no more amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt you. This
day you may gather this heauenlie <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
as the Iſralites might gather theyr <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
ſixe dayes together,<note place="margin">Exod, 16</note> but to morrow (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
and ſixe dayes after you, may not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it, as on the ſeauenth day <hi>Manna</hi> might
not be found.</p>
               <p>The Lord graunt that you may gather
ſufficient foode for the ſuſtentation of your
ſoules, that as <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet iournied in
<pb facs="tcp:18030:14"/>
the ſtrength of the meate that the Angell
brought him,<note place="margin">1, Reg. 19.</note> euen vnto <hi>Horeb</hi> the Mount
of God, ſo you in the ſtrength of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
meate which heere I bring you, may
be able to paſſe thorowe the daungerous
wayes of this troubleſome worlde, vnto
Gods holy Mountaine, the Hauen of all
happineſſe, whither hee bring vs that hath
deerely bought vs with his precious bloud,
euen Chriſt Ieſus the righteous: to whome
with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, three
perſons and one GOD, be giuen all glorie
and maieſtie, world without, end <hi>Amen.</hi>
