            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I ſhall give your Lordſhip an account of this: I ſuppoſe (my Lord) we have done nothing but what was cuſtomary, a Seizure we have made now, but after we had heard this Gentleman was committed for Felony and Burglary, and that none but Children were in the houſe (my Lord) we thought it our duty both for his good to ſecure his Eſtate if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, and ſo for the King if convicted, that ſo the ſame might not be imbezel'd; and thereupon cauſed an Inventory to be taken thereof: But (my Lord) we diſpoſſeſſed none, it is true we have left a Servant or two, for whom we are and muſt be reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; what ever they would diſpoſe or had occaſion for they had it without contradiction; we offered him that if he had any friend of his own that would undertake them to be forth coming in caſe he were convict, we would leave them in poſſeſſion of them, we have made no Seizure; what we have done is according to cuſtome, if we have not done that which your Lordſhips approve of, we beg your pardon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. J. Hide.</speaker>
               <p>We are to look to that which is according to Law, the goods of a man that is accuſed of Felony (he is but only ſo yet) he forfeits none of his goods till convict, more than that he is to live upon them during his Tryall; but on the other hand, where a man is accuſed of Felony, and Indicted for it, it is but prudence and agreeable to Law to take care the goods be not imbezel'd, becauſe if a conviction follow they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited to the King; therefore the Sheriffs have done but what they ought to do, they are not taken from you, what you have occaſion for, either for Money (or Goods to turn into Money) for your preſent ſupply till your Tryall be over, God forbid but you ſhould have it, and you ſhall have it, if you have any friend that will undertake the Goods ſhall be forth coming for the King in caſe you be convicted, or for your ſelf if acquitted it ſhall be done; in the mean time what you have occaſion for your ſelf, Wife, or Children, God forbid but you ſhould have it; and this is as much as by Juſtice you ought to claim.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Turner.</speaker>
               <p>I ſubmit to your Honour, and I beg of your Honour and the Bench to be of Counſell for me, for though the world looks on me as a Solicitor, it is a miſtake my Lord, it is not in Law, I am a ſtranger to it, it has been only in dealings for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101306:6"/>
by purchaſes and the like: But my Lord, I am informed your Lordſhip may reſtore me theſe Goods without Security; if the Law directs Security, I am ready to give it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Bridgm.</speaker>
               <p>For that that you may not miſtake the Law, it is very true, the words of the Statute of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> ſayes a mans Goods ſhall not be Seized before Indicted; you muſt underſtand the difference of the Law, that has made the miſtake, it was then good but not now, then a mans courſe was to Indict them and Proceſſe againſt them before committed, but now it is altered, for when it remained indifferent whether Guilty or not Guilty, he was to be maintained out of his Goods, ſo ought you and your Family, for the Town being anſwerable for the Goods of ſuch a Felon, that they might not be amerced, in ſuch caſes ſufficient Sureties were given, the Statute of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> that gives the power of commitment by Juſtices of Peace; and ſo now it is quite altered, and though they cannot ſeize the Goods, yet they being reſponſible for them, they ought to have good Security.</p>

               <p>I do aſſure your Lordſhips that from the very firſt hour we put our people into the houſe none of his Family there then or now have been denyed any thing in the houſe; if I be not miſinformed that very night that he was committed there was conveyed out of his houſe for his uſe and his occaſions ſome ſay 200 <hi>l.</hi> they that ſay leaſt ſay 100 <hi>l.</hi> they have had a free Diſpoſal of what was in the houſe, and then my Lord could we do leſſe then what we have done?</p>

               <p>There needs not much a-doe for Security; if your Tryall was not to be preſently, then there were cauſe for you to inſiſt on this, but now there is but one night, if you want any thing for this night, the Sheriffs here offer you what you will, to morrow will determine the Queſtion, whether theſe Goods are yours, or no.</p>

in bed; the Man confeſſed he had been abroad twenty or thirty times at Coll. <hi>Turner</hi>'s Houſe at Supper about a year ſince; the Maid denied they had been there at all; but it is true the mans ſaying he ſupp'd there (though it was falſe) was the firſt occaſion of ſuſpicion of Coll. <hi>Turner.</hi> When I had examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe two, I went to the Examination of <hi>Turner,</hi> where he was all that day, where at night? he told me, at ſeveral places and Taverns, and in bed at nine of the Clock, and was called out of his bed; but having my ſelf ſome ſuſpicion of him, I wiſhed him to withdraw; I told Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved if he was not the Theif, he knew where the things were; the old Gentleman ſaid he could not miſtruſt him, he had put a great Confidence in him; but I deſired him to give me leave to Charge him with it; and thereupon I called him in, but he denied it, but not as a perſon of his Spirit, which gave me ſome cauſe of further ſuſpicion: I deſired to ſearch his houſe, nay, told him I would whether he would or no; he deſired to go home, I told him if he would go with them (ſome perſons there) he ſhould; but you ſhall not ſpeak with your Sons, or Daughters, or Servants; they ſhall be examined by me; they ſearched his houſe, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall and Conſtable, they ſaid they could find nothing. The old Gentleman, was very unwilling to charge him with Felony, ſome friends there were as well ſatisfied as I was that he was Guilty of it, and they brought me a Paper that he would charge him, and thereupon I wiſhed him to read that Paper, told him I could do no leſſe then ſend him to <hi>Newgate:</hi> Sayes he, you will not undoe a Family, will you, will you not take bail? No I cannot. What proof have you materiall againſt me? I will give you as good bail as any man, give me leave to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Tryan.</hi> I did give him leave; he had no ſooner ſpoke with him but Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> would not charge him, he promiſing to indevour to find the Thief. I took Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> on one ſide, and told him, I did as verily beleive if he was not the Thief he could find him out, as I beleived I ſhould go home to my Wife and Children; and I ſaid that if an Angel from heaven ſhould come and tell me otherwiſe, I could hardly beleive it, This paſſed on this night, I could not ſleep all the night, ſtill it

was in my thoughts that this man was the man that had done the Robbery; next morning after 9. there came a Gentleman to me, a perſon of quality; a Merchant; if your Lordſhip deſires, I ſhall name him.</p>

               <p>It was Alderman <hi>Love,</hi> my Lord; he told me that he thought I was a friend to Juſtice, if I would go preſently into the <hi>Minories</hi> my ſelf, I might diſcover the perſon that robb'd Mr. <hi>Tryan,</hi> if I ſtaid or ſent others, the Birds would be flown, Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> has this morning removed ſeveral hundred pounds; I went preſently with a Footboy, when I came to <hi>Biſhopſgate,</hi> meeting with Major <hi>Tasker,</hi> knowing not whether I went without the Liberties, ſaid I to him, Are you in haſt? Pray go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with me, and he went with me.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman, Alderman <hi>Love,</hi> told me, I ſhould meet with a Maid Servant of his that knew me though I knew not her, ſhe will meet you at ſuch a Corner; and go with you: when I came without <hi>Algate</hi> I met with two Maids that were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſhew me the place, the Maid told me theſe were the Maids, I bid them come behind me, at the further end of all the <hi>Minories</hi> I went into a ſhop, and found Col. <hi>Turner</hi> with his hands in a Cheſt, I charged him to take nothing out, and not to ſtir himſelf, there was two Wallets, one of a 100 <hi>l.</hi> the other 200 <hi>l.</hi> I took the Keys from him, laid them upon the Compter; I went with him into the next room, which was the Kitchin, and in another Cheſt was two Wallets more, and now the Gentleman was ſpeechleſſe; I told him it was juſt as I told him the laſt night, that your Roguery would come out; what (ſaid I) is become of the reſt of the money? ſayes he, your haſt will ſpoil all; I called in the Maid to examine her, but ſhe was fearful, and ſo trembled there was no examining her before Col. <hi>Turner:</hi> But in concluſion, ſaid I, Col. <hi>Turner</hi> if you will tell me whether this be Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi>'s money, I will do you all the favour I can; ſayes he, I cannot ſay it is his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; I called for a Condable, and made a <hi>Mittimus</hi> to ſend him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> thinking he would diſcover the Truth; ſaid I,

will you give me your Examination? he did, it is in Court; I asked him whence this money came? he told me it was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by himſelf, his Wife and Children, this morning.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I asked him where he had received it; he told me at a Goldſmiths 14 dayes ſince, he did not remember his name; I asked why he ſhould remove his own money, his anſvver was, he did remove it for 2, or 3, dayes, till this foolery was over.</p>
               <p>When I ſaw I could get nothing further from him, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with him touching the remainder of the money and the Jewels; ſayes he, Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> do not trouble your ſelf, you will loſe the Jewels and the reſt of the money by this courſe; and ſayes he, I am now in purſuit of them; if you will give me leave to go to the old Gentleman, I know all will be well. I was not content to let him go; but preſently we called a <hi>Hackney Coach,</hi> and my ſelf, and him, and Major <hi>Tasker</hi> went, and carried that money to Mr. <hi>Tryan;</hi> when we came there, I told Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> I thought we had brought 500 <hi>l.</hi> of his money, and I did not doubt but I had brought a perſon that could tell of the reſt of his money and jewels. Col. <hi>Turner</hi> deſired to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> himſelf in private; I gave him leave; he calls me a little after, Sir (ſayes he) Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> and I am agreed, I muſt have this money delivered to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I have aſſured him he ſhall have all his money and jewels again by Three of the Clock this Afternoon. I told him I could not agree that he ſhould have the money back again, preſt him that he would ſtay there, and ſend for the reſt of the money and jewells: but he would (if I did not) truſt him; Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> would have the reſt of his money and all his jewels again.</p>

               <p>If he had ſaid he would have endevoured it, I would not have parted with him, but he ſaid he ſhould have the money and jewels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I told him I would meet him at that time at Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi>'s. Then I took Mr. <hi>Tryan,</hi> and ſaid what ever promiſe you have made in private, you muſt excuſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101306:10"/>
my aſſenting to any thing againſt the Law: but do not tell him of it, leſt you loſe the Jewels; I muſt commit him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and I muſt bind you to proſecute him: he deſired me I would not come ſo ſoon as 3, not till 4, or 5, of the Clock, and all would be brought thither; I ſtaid till about 4. In the Interim, I heard ſome particulars what theſe Maies would teſtifie, which teſtimony had I received before I parted with him, I would not have parted with him for any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: But when I came thither in the Afternoon, I heard Col. <hi>Turner</hi> was Arreſted, and was then at the <hi>Hoop-</hi>Tavern with the Officers, I ſent immediately the Marſhal and his men to bring him to me. The Officers and he came, and then Col. <hi>Turner</hi> told me, I had brought all theſe things, but the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers prevented me; I was a very unfortunate man; give me but leave till to morrow at 9 of the Clock, and you ſhall have all. Said I, I have now heard more, and you muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the money and Jewels, if you expect any favour from me, or I know what to do. He preſſed very hard an hour or almoſt two, that he might be truſted to go for them; if he did not go, Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> would loſe the reſt of his money and jewels; I told him I had rather they ſhould be all loſt, then I ſhould forfeit my diſcretion and reputation. And thus he kept us till 7 or 8 at night; at laſt he would have gone with one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; I told him no, if there were enough to ſecure you, I might give leave; ſaith he, the party will not ſee more then one, for his Life would be in danger. Whether would you go? I would go, ſaith he (to my beſt remembrance) to <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> or <hi>White-Chappel;</hi> I ſhould have met him at 5 of the Clock, and now I muſt meet him about 9. I will call in the Officers; they will tell you, your being upon a Judgement they will not part with you without the Liberties; nor will I give leave, becauſe the Sheriffs will blame me: The Officers ſaid they could not go without the Liberties, for it would be an Eſcape in Law; pray give me leave to go neer thoſe places, and I will ſend: my, then you may aſwell ſend from hence: he begged leave to go to the <hi>Hoop-</hi>Tavern and ſend for his Wife, which I did grant; and there he did ſend for his Wife; they brought me
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101306:11"/>
word he had ſent his Wife for the Jewels, and the reſt of the moneys; he ſent to me not to think the time too long, for he had notice his Wife was coming; I directed the Marſhal when his Wife came he would ſecure her. About a 11. of the Clock they brought his Wife, who told me ſhe had delivered the Jewels; they thought they were in two Bags. Then he came to me, and deſired to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> in private, and told me Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi>'s Soul was pawned to him, and his to the Thief, that no diſcovery ſhould be made; but then I exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Wife, what money went from her houſe that morning? ſhe ſaid ſhe knew of none. Where had you the Jewels? ſhe knew of none, but ſhe had a couple of Bags that ſhe was ſent for, neer <hi>Whitechappel</hi> or the <hi>Tower,</hi> a perſon ſhould meet her, and ask what ſhe did there, and ſhe ſhould ſay ſhe walked up and down for ſomething that ſhould be given her by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; which if he did, ſhe was to bring it to him that ſent her. He did deliver the two Bags, which ſhe delivered to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but what was in them ſhe knew not. There was Sir <hi>Tho. Chamberlane,</hi> Mr. <hi>Millington,</hi> my ſelf, and Col. <hi>Turner,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Tryan;</hi> the two Bags was laid upon a Dreſſer; he told us they were now come, and having performed his part, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> would perform his. Have you performed your part? have you brought the Jewels and the remainder of the Money? He told us the money was not brought, for the 600 <hi>l.</hi> I ſhall give Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> my Bond, to pay him at 6 Months: w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt to ſee the Jewels; we run them all over. But I ſhould have told you one thing, ſhe brought a Cats-head-eye-ring upon her Finger; this the Gentleman was like to forget, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it to me to deliver that with the reſt. When we had told out the Jewels, we croſſed them out upon the printed Paper as they were called; ſhe ſaid all that was in the Paper, except one Carcanet of Diamonds and Jewels valued at 200 <hi>l.</hi> that is fallen behind the Cheſt, or aſide. You have 2000 pounds worth of Jewels over what is in the Paper, but that Carcanet ſhall be forth coming. He now preſſed that no proſecution might be, for two Souls were pawned (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) and deſired an end of the buſineſſe. I told him further
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101306:11"/>
and preſſed him; ſaid I, I have ſtaid a great while, and would ſtay longer, if he might have the 600 <hi>l.</hi> and the Carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net: but when I ſaw there was nothing more to be got from him; now (ſaid I) what would you have this poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to do for you? what he hath promiſed you I know not, he is a ſtranger to the Law; if there had been but you two had it, and it had not been publiſhed to the world, and the Neighbors publique Examination taken, ſomewhat might have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your ſelves: But would you have this Gentleman bring himſelf into danger? he will loſe all his Goods again, for he will be indicted himſelf; what will he be the better for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, when he muſt loſe his jewels and money, and be liable to a proſecution as you will be, were he ſo ignorant? Do you think that I underſtand the Law no better, being a Juſtice of Peace, to bring my ſelf into danger; all the kindneſſe I can do for you is, (to be ſhort) I muſt ſend you and your Wiſe to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How ſay you, Maſter Alderman? then I had better to have kept the Jewells; thoſe were his Words, to the beſt of my remembrance he ſaid ſo.</p>

I cannot tell, but I will not bring my ſelf into danger; he prayed me I would give him leave to go home.

The night he was robbed his Servant being gone the dore was double locked, you knew all the private places where the Keys lay, all the rooms wherein Caſh, Jewels, where every thing was; and it was not poſſible this Burglary could be committed but by one that knew thoſe things.</p>

               <p>It falls out that the ſelf-ſame night after this houſe was robbed in the Morning early, you, your Wife and Son go to remove ſtore of Money out of your houſe.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>When you carry this you go with a falſe ſtory that a Merchant was broke, and you muſt needs have ſome of the money for his Wife, and 8 Children, and this money was to be ſet aſide for them.—</p>

               <speaker>L. Ch. J. Hide.</speaker>
               <p>You will do well to hold your peace a while; Your Wife and You diſowned you removed any money, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when the money was brought there and taken upon Suſpicion (you taken in the very place removing the money) you owned it to be your own; that then it appeared that one of thoſe Bags was ſealed with the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi>'s Seal; and at the time of the Burglary there was 600 <hi>l.</hi> in Bags left
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101306:25"/>
with Mr. <hi>Tryon,</hi> ſealed with the ſaid Seal, and one of thoſe Bags you brought back was taken with you, and owned to be your own; and had the ſame Seal; that's proved by Four or Five Witneſſes, compared with the Seal of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Biſhop. Your Son on their coming thither, he takes footing and leaps over the Ditch to eſcape, which is a good juſt ground of Suſpicion, that he is guilty of ſomewhat that he would not abide to anſwer; your ſelf and Wife take upon you to know every thing; you know how the uſage was; that there was a purpoſe they ſhould not be killed; that he was gagged; that they exceeded their Commiſſion; if the Man and Maid had been at home they ſhould have been but bound; all particulars you take upon you to know; and to confeſs the whole and the manner of it; Nay, tell the ſtory how they came in.—</p>

I drank a Cup of Syder (for I kept a Hodges-head of Syder in my houſe) as ſoon as I drank it, I went out of doors imediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſaid I to this youngeſt ſon, ſtay at home, I ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to uſe you by and by. I went to Mr. <hi>Tryons,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, I found Mr. <hi>Gurney</hi> the Merchant; ſaid!, Mr. <hi>Gurney</hi> I have good newes, I have ſome hopes of ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, that Mr. <hi>Tryon</hi> will not looſe one penny worth of his goods, marry ſaid he, I am glad of that; we went up to Mr. <hi>Tryons,</hi> we found him ſitting by a little Char-cole fire, as much as you may cover with your hands; he told us he had been up ever ſince three of the clock: we asked him, what he would have to comfort him, he told us, he had ſomething. Mr. <hi>Gurney</hi> after ſome diſcourſe, took his leave of him, ſo I ſat down. <hi>(Jeſus what a noyſe is here in the Court my Lord, I can hear but with one eare)</hi> I ſay, I ſat down at the bed-ſide of Mr. <hi>Tryon,</hi> he on the ſtool, Mr. <hi>Tryon</hi> ſaid I, I have good news for you; ſaith he, haſt thou, I am glad of it, with all my ſoul; Sir ſaid I, I am informed, you will not looſe any of your goods or money, there is but thirty eight ſhillings ſpent of all your money, the Rogues took but forty ſhillings out, and <hi>Wild</hi> told me there was two ſhillings ſaved; I dare boldly ſay, by three of the clock in the afternoon, you will be maſter of them

again, I would be glad of that, and will give you five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds; but Sir ſaid I, there is a taile hangs by this; you know you ſhould have been robbed about a year ſince, and I have apprehended <hi>Wilde</hi> who was one of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Thieves; then he hath made me ſwear <hi>By the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. that he ſhall have his life, if you have your goods; he hath engaged me, that you ſhall likewiſe ſwear by the like Oath, or elſe you ſhall hang him, and ſo looſe your goods; ſaid I, I have a great part of your money, but the Jewels and the reſt of your money is wanting: the old Gentleman was almoſt over joyed, this is not true ſaid he, ſaid I, I do declare this is true in the preſence of God, make no words of it, if the buſineſſe be diſcovered we ſhall looſe the Jewels; well ſaid he, I will be ruled by you Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, and the Lord God make me thankful I have ſuch a friend in the world that hath done this for me, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make you amends, and thereupon he entred into the ſame Oath, <hi>That by the Blood,</hi> &amp;c. the blood of the man ſhould not be ſpilt, though he loſt both Money and Jewels; I diſcourſed with him, I told him over and over again, left him ſatisfied, that I would be with him again, and bring him more tideings, but by three a clock I doubted not but he ſhould have all; then it was almoſt eight at night, away went I to <hi>Tower-hill</hi> to look my Merchant <hi>John VVild,</hi> he was here in <hi>Newgate</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly there found I him walking by the <hi>Blew-boare,</hi> careleſly walking there, with his Coat under his Arms; ſaid I, how now, what news, I think I have now pleaſed you; ſaith he what? have you done, ſaid I, I have lodged the money hard by and all is right, what have you done, is all right on he other ſide, all ſhall be well: but where have you lodged it? here at a Sempſtreſs, at the corner of the <hi>Minnories;</hi> ſaid he, the money muſt be removed, there are Sales-men thereabouts, and the fellow that hath the Jewels he is known, he will not come thither; remove it towards the water ſide, any where, and the things ſhall come my life for it. They had a Cats Eye Ring, they were ſuch wiſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101306:29"/>
Lapidaries, they called this 100l. Ring, when it was not worth 5l. He gave order that the money might be again removed to the other end by the <hi>Horſhooe</hi> Tavern; I run home, fetch'd my Son, ſaid, I Wife, we muſt have away the mony: My Lord, he told me he would have away the mony to the Half-moon Tavern in St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> or the corner Tavern at the <hi>Irougate,</hi> ſaid I, are not you reſolved, well ſaid he, it ſhall be carried to St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> he would meet my Son at the <hi>Noah Arke,</hi> at <hi>Tower Ditch;</hi> let my Son but hand the money over that Path, and he would hand it to the other; We did carry it, carried again, at his ſecond car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying comes Sr. <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> he had heard ſome Cry of money left, he comes with a great company of People af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and the fooliſh Wench ſaid to my Son Mr. <hi>John,</hi> fly for your life. <hi>John</hi> being ſurprized and affrighted, he went out of the back doore, went over the Ditch and went to my Houſe. Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> had alſo ſent to ſecure my houſe; when the lad came home into the ſtreer, my doores were ſhut up: (Gentlemen of the Jury do you underſtand) the boy ſeeing ſuch a rout at the doore, ſaith the people, Mr. <hi>John</hi> your Fathers houſe is ſhut up about Mr. <hi>Tryons</hi> money, he walked by the ſtreet and went into <hi>Biſhopſgate</hi> ſtreet, and <hi>Cheap ſide</hi> into <hi>Pater-Noſter-row,</hi> and ſo into <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet:</hi> I did not hear of him till Saturday in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.</p>
               <p>When Sr. <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> came, ſaith he, Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> here we have catcht you and the money; ſaid I, If you be haſty and paſſionate as you were laſt night, you will ſpoile all the whole buſineſſe: Tell me ſaith he, whoſe money it is, ſaid I, it is my money; the truth is, the Old Gentleman hath promiſed me 500l. it is the naked truth, I would not have Sr. <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> the honour of gaining it, but I would have the honour of gaining it my way.</p>

Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> would know whether it was my Money, <hi>I</hi> told <hi>I</hi> had received part of it at a Gold-ſmiths, ſo <hi>I</hi> put Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> off, Come, come, ſaid he, we will carry this money to Mr. <hi>Tryon,</hi> ſaid I to Mr. <hi>Tryon,</hi> here is part of your money, you know what <hi>I</hi> told you even now, <hi>I</hi> ſaith he, God be thanked, before Sir, <hi>Thomas Allein; I</hi> asked him what his promiſe was, and told him how the paſſage was in ſhort; And the old man did acknowledg that ſuch a promiſe was made, and would have down upon his Knees; <hi>I</hi> paſſed my word to him that by three a Clock, <hi>I</hi> doubted not but he would have his Jewels, and the reſt of the money; ſaith Sir, <hi>Thomas Alleyn</hi> go whether he ſaid, live and proſper <hi>I</hi> know not, go God bleſs you, and upon my honour, <hi>(I</hi> think that was his word) the old man ſhall make good his word, I but Sir, <hi>Thomas</hi> what will become of me and you, by this buſineſs, for I underſtand the Law; how will this buſineſs be daubed up, you will be fined; Sir, <hi>Thomas, I</hi> muſt break my word, he muſt be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or <hi>I</hi> muſt ſuffer, ſaith Sir, <hi>Thomas</hi> do not trouble me with that, get but the goods, and the old mans word ſhall be made good, leave that to me; more then that he ſaid, he would make up the buſineſs, or he would ſmother it. My Lord, you have a great deal of patience, <hi>I</hi> am humbly bound to you, here is nothing but the naked truth, ſtep by ſtep, as <hi>I</hi> trod it; Afterwards <hi>Wild</hi> came and ſaid, all will be well; ſaid <hi>I</hi> what have you done, are you ſure, ſaith he, the Jewels, nor nothing ſhall be ſtirred; ſaid <hi>I,</hi> you ſee all is ſpoiled; Sir, <hi>Thomas Aleyn</hi> is come where we had lodge the mony, the thing is known, do not they hear of it; Yes, they hear as well as you, and know what is done, and ſome have Eye: upon you, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> they will run away with the Jewels; No, you ſhall meet about three a Clock; no body knows me but you, your Wife, and your

               <p>It is agreed, for Gods ſake look to it, your life and mine is concerned if the Jewels be loſt, I will perſecute you to the Death, look they are preſerved and not purloyned; ſaith he, the baggs were never opened, I parted with him, he was to look for me at three of the clock; coming home about Change time, who ſhould I meet with but Mr. <hi>Stubbs,</hi> who told me that it was all the News upon the Exchange that you have been in the Robery; Said I, do not trouble your head, I have diſcovered the buſineſs; Then ſaid <hi>Stubbs</hi> you know I and <hi>Thomas Lyon</hi> are Bail for you, at that time I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied him; Afterwards that day I met with Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> the Officer, ſaid he, Colonel I Arreſt you? for what? for more fooleries yet; <hi>Thomas Lyon</hi> will not be ſatisfied, by ſix of the clock this buſineſs will be all over, nothing will ſerve your turn but violence, violence, no force, no Law, I was forced to go to the Hoope Tavern; I got them to ſend for Mr. <hi>Stubbs</hi> and <hi>Lyon,</hi> they came, Said I, what will you have?

               <p>You of the Jury, it is high time to let you go together to conſider your Verdict; we will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you no more in this buſineſs to day: Here is an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt <hi>James Turner, John Turner,</hi> and <hi>William Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> for a Burglary in breaking the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Francis Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> in the night-time, and taking away a great deal of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Jewels: you have heard it particularly named: it is likewiſe charged, That <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Ely</hi> knowing of <hi>John</hi> to have committed this Felony and Burglary, did comfort and abet him afterwards: I ſhall ſpeak to them two firſt. <hi>Mary</hi> the Wife of <hi>James Turner,</hi> though it appears all along that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101306:39"/>
the had a hand in this buſineſs, yet nothing appears at all, but doing only that which her Husband had directed; then by Law ſhe cannot be acceſſary for committing of Felony. For <hi>Ely</hi> the other acceſſary,! did not obſerve in the whole courſe of the evidence, any thing at all againſt him, that he was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to any thing at all, for that of the carrying of the money, it appears to be <hi>John;</hi> for them two, <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> nothing is faſtened upon them; then the matter is to <hi>James, John,</hi> and <hi>William Turner:</hi> I hope, and I am ſure you are nearer, and you take notes of what hath been delivered; I have not your memories; you are young, and no perſons better: you are men of underſtanding, I need not repeat particulars to you; thus much I muſt ſay in the general, That it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes neceſſary, but for that I ſhall deſire my Lord <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to declare it to you. A man may be guilty of a Burgla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though he be not in the place, in the room where it was committed: or thus: if three or four men come together with purpoſe to rob a houſe, two go in and do the ſeat, and the reſt ſtay without, to ſee no body comes to prevent, or to receive, one or other coming to that purpoſe, thoſe that are without the Houſe, are as guilty of the Burglary as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that went in: no man will deny the Law to be ſo. Then weigh your evidence; it appears by the Coach-man, that he ſaw four men that had Handkerchiefs about their necks, two upon one ſide, the other two upon the other ſide of the door; though there were but two appeared to Mr. <hi>Tryan,</hi> yet there being four in company, and Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> himſelf tells ye, that by the ſtory from his Intelligencer, there was three or four; whom they were, or whether there was any or no, God knows; but rather ſuppoſe it to be a ſtory of his own fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. He walked up and down on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> took the Thief by the throat, and there kept him about two hours, and paſt four a clock before they brought the ſecond bags: Then weigh that particular knowledge that Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> had of all theſe things, that upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> before he met with this this <hi>William Turner,</hi> a perſon you ſee, of what quality (I ſhall not repeat) he cannot give account of himſelf what he is;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101306:39"/>
and that night when this Robbery was committed, he ſayes he was at home, they are his own words; he might have had witneſs to have proved this, as well as Mr. <hi>Turner.</hi> But for <hi>James Turner,</hi> it's true it appears, and no doubt he was that night at home: The Conſtable went to his Houſe upon the occaſion of <hi>Tryans</hi> mans ſaying he ſupt there, went to find whether he ſupt there, that was indeed falſe; but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and thoſe that went there, found them a-bed. But then take the time when this Robbery was done, it was between eight and nine, and he was found in bed at paſt ten, though indeed the Thieves ſaid it was eleven, as you might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by Mr. <hi>Tryan:</hi> it muſt be left to you upon the proof: you ſee when he comes the next day, he undertakes to find out the Thieves, and that only upon a ſuſpition, that there being a purpoſe to rob Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> a year before, he goes to the ſame place now, he found <hi>Weild</hi> out then; he had very good luck, that becauſe he lodged there a year before, he muſt have the ſame lodging now: it's a likely matter that Thieves, as <hi>Weild</hi> is, ſhould keep their lodgings thus conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There he finds him, takes him by the throat, and there they were playing a while, there one comes, goes, and brings ſome part of the money: After all this, the next day he muſt take his word to come again, and to bring the Jewels: ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve but this; after which time as the money was received, yet by a token, though he never ſaw the woman before, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing her a ſhort fat woman, with a long black Scarf; he muſt meet her, askt what ſhe wanted, and muſt give her Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of that value; 'tis one of the fineſt fram'd ſtories that I have heard, that this man ſhould come to be thus privy, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf ſtood charg'd, and the Jewels brought for all this, and yet he muſt know nothing of it. You obſerve the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and the circumſtances themſelves, the Witneſſes he call'd in point of reputation, that I muſt leave to you. I have been here many a fair time, few men that come to be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, but ſhall have ſome come and ſay, He is a very honeſt man, I never knew any hurt by him; but is this any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the evidence of the Fact? But you have here the whole, I ſhall leave it to you.</p>

               <speaker>L. Bridgeman.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, my Lord hath repeated to you the evidence: I ſhall repeat nothing of that; onely one or two things I ſhall obſerve to you. Firſt, in point of Law, and I muſt agree in opinion with what my Lord ſays; but in this caſe there will be ſomething more conſidered, that is, whether or no (for this is the Law) if a man have a falſe Key, (we are now upon the point of Law) and we ought to be of Counſel with him and you, to direct that which is right. If he appear plainly to be an Acceſſary, you muſt finde him guilty of this Indictment: for that, you muſt conſider circumſtances, whether he broke open the houſe or no: then you muſt obſerve Mr. <hi>Tryans</hi> door was ſhut, it was not broken open by a Crow; therefore you may conclude that it is very probable they had a Pick-lock: but that I muſt leave to you; either they muſt come in by one being in the houſe, or by a Pick-lock: but to ſay by one in that houſe, you have no reaſon to preſume on that: if by a Pick-lock, whoſoever they were, they muſt be known, not ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the houſe; not <hi>William Turner</hi> alone, but he that knew the houſe, and all the paſſages and doors; knew where the Keys and Jewels were: then who probably ſhould be in the houſe; it was not for a ſtranger to be in the houſe, onely one that muſt know all. If that <hi>James Turner</hi> ſhall appear to you to have a hand in it, if you think he was acceſſary, you muſt finde him guilty as Principal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Col. Turner.</speaker>
               <p>God forbid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Bridgeman.</speaker>
               <p>If he were amongſt them, if the Door be opened by a Pick-lock, it is a direct Burglary, as if broke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by an Iron Bar: but that muſt be left to you. In the next place to prove the Burglary, you ſee what a ſtory he tells you, with all the circumſtances, as if he had been there: He tells you from this <hi>VVeild,</hi> (if there be any ſuch, you muſt take it upon his word) how the mans tooth came out; what he meant to do with the other perſons; and all other things about that affair. Obſerve another thing of Sir <hi>Thomas Chamberlain:</hi> ſays he, We ſuſpected him from the firſt; we could not examine any, but he would be thruſting in, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101306:40"/>
liſtening. I ſay, admit that you ſhould be by the evidence perſwaded he had a hand in the buſineſs, you muſt finde him as Principal: for nothing in the world more ordinary, if a man intend to commit ſuch a Felony or Burglary, he will be ſure to have witneſs to prove he was here, or in ſuch a place at the time when this Robbery was committed. By all that I can gueſs, and I believe that I gueſs right, this Robbery was between eight and nine a clock at night: when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable came to Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> no doubt, as it was his wiſeſt way, he was then in bed, but can prove nothing at all elſe. The truth is, upon all that he hath ſaid himſelf, if it be true as he hath ſaid, he hath made himſelf a direct Acceſſary to a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony: for firſt of all, being examined before a Juſtice of of Peace, Sir <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> he ſaid himſelf that the money he carryed, was the money he had of a Goldſmith: truly his whole ſtory is a direct Romance. This man muſt go upon the <hi>Friday-</hi>night, about 11 or 12 a clock; and there is a Proverb of <hi>A blind mans catching a Hare:</hi> if it can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to any thing, it muſt be to this. He muſt go between 11 and 12 a clock at night without a Lanthorn, a good way above his own houſe, and there he muſt walk, and think ſome <hi>Mephiſtophilus</hi> ſhould come and tell him who is the man; that he ſhould take him by the throat, though he could call two more with one whiſtle, and there get him to deliver the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: truly he was a very noble and ingenious Thief. But all this you muſt take upon his own word. Now he knows the money was diſcovered; then it was a Merchants that had failed, and muſt be ſecured for the uſe of his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. If you do believe all this that he hath ſaid, he was neither Principal nor Acceſſary to this Felony, but Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary enough to <hi>Weild:</hi> but that's not the preſent buſineſs; it is whether upon all theſe circumſtances, the money having been found with them, he being the man that brought the money, and his Wife the Jewels, whether you do believe the reſt of the ſtory he hath made for himſelf. If you believe he had a hand in the buſineſs, you muſt finde him as Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal. I ſhall deſire a little further direction: ſuppoſe it were
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101306:41"/>
as he ſayes, that one was within, and he opens the dore, and lets in others, if he himſelf was one that did come in, I take it to be Burglary in them all; it was an unlawful coming in: So that upon all theſe circumſtances, firſt, Whether you do believe that he had a hand in it, or no, or this fine ſtory that is made. Next, Whether you do believe this was one that was there; you muſt believe him guilty as principal. But I leave it to you.</p>

               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt. Hide.</speaker>
               <p>To the laſt I ſay, If one comes in by day with a purpoſe before-hand to rob the houſe by night, if he opens the door, which is almoſt impoſſible here, becauſe the man ſwears it was double-lockt, it muſt be opened with a key; if he opened the door, and the reſt comes in and robs him, that is Burglary in them all.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the Jury withdraw'd, and after near an hours conſultation, they returned to the Court, and took their places; their names being called, they ſeverally anſwered.</p>

That there were four perſons that robbed him, Col. <hi>James Turner, William Turner, White</hi> a Sollicitor, and <hi>VVhite</hi>'s Friend, whoſe Name they knew not. That upon Thurſday the ſeventh day of <hi>January</hi> inſtant, Col. <hi>James Turner, VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Turner, VVhite,</hi> and the other perſon whoſe Name they knew not, met at the Red-Lyon in <hi>Biſhopſgate-ſtreet</hi> near to St. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lleus,</hi> about three of the clock in the afternoon, where they dined; Col. <hi>Turner</hi> fetched a neck of Veal from the Cooks for their dinner, and then they agreed to rob Mr. <hi>Francis Tryan</hi> (who lives in <hi>Lime-ſtreet)</hi> that night, and went to meet again at the ſame Houſe by ſix of the clock that evening; but the room where they were to meet, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, they went over to the four Swans, or the Green Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and there they all ſtaid till eight of the clock. Col <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> did then aſſure them, that the dores ſhould be opened, for that by his own confeſſion he had got the impreſſion of the key of the dore in Wax, and had another key made by it, but knew not the Smith that made the key. From that place Col. <hi>Turner</hi> carried them to the New-Market in Leaden-Hall, where they ſate upon the Stalls for the ſpace of half an hour, and then he came unto them, and told them the Man and Maid were now gone out, and that now was their time. Thereupon Col. <hi>Turner</hi> opened the door with his key, and let them in; then they went up the ſtairs, Col. <hi>Turner</hi> leading the way; he light a Candle in the Kitchin, and went up into Mr. <hi>Tryans</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all four of them; Col. <hi>Turner</hi> went near the beds feet, the Curtains being drawn cloſe; <hi>VVhite</hi> and the other perſons put a cloath into Mr. <hi>Tryans</hi> mouth, ſtopt it, and bound his feet and his hands. Col. <hi>Turner</hi> brought down the Key of the Ware-Houſe and the Counting Houſe out of his pocket, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the Ware-Houſe door, and the Counting-Houſe, and took the Keys of the Iron Cheſt, and took out the Money and the Jewels: <hi>VVilliam Turner</hi> carried two Wallets with four Bags of Money, as he conceives; and Col. <hi>Turner</hi> ſaid, that the ſaid <hi>VVill. Turner</hi> carryed four hundred pounds; and <hi>VVhite</hi> carryed two Wallets more, ſuppoſed to be four Bags of ſome hundred pounds. Col. <hi>Turner</hi> and the other
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101306:42"/>
perſon carryed the reſt of the Money, only Col. <hi>Turner</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away the Jewels in his two Bags. That <hi>VVilliam Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> did not ſee any money, but as they ſaid it was money. They did not ſtay in Mr. <hi>Tryans</hi> houſe above an hour. That they carryed all the aforeſaid Money and Jewels into a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one <hi>Nicholas Hickenſons</hi> houſe in <hi>Lowſie-Lane</hi> in <hi>Dukes-Place,</hi> which they hired ſome days before, pretending it for the uſe of a Maſter of a Ship, his Mate, Purſer and Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain. They carried the money in about ten a clock at night; when the Maid let them in, they blew out the candle, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Money and Jewels, <hi>VVilliam Turner</hi> going under the name of Purſer. Col. <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>VVilliam Turner</hi> came away that night, and left the Money and the Jewels there; the next morning Col. <hi>Turner</hi> fetcht away the Money and Jewels at five turns to his own houſe, and ſaith, that <hi>William Turner</hi> was to have a hundred pounds of the money for his pains; <hi>VVhite</hi> and his friend twenty pounds apiece for their pains, and Col. <hi>Turner</hi> was, to have the reſt. That <hi>VVilliam Turner</hi> knew not of any of the Jewels, nor <hi>VVhite,</hi> none but Col. <hi>Turner.</hi> That after that night <hi>VVilliam Turner</hi> never ſaw Col. <hi>Turner</hi> nor the other perſons in the Robbery, till himſelf with Col. <hi>Turner</hi> and others were arraigned for the fact at <hi>Newgate.</hi> Neither did the ſaid <hi>VVilliam Turner</hi> ſee any Money or Jewels opened; neither did he receive one penny of the money; neither was he in the Compting-Houſe of Mr. <hi>Tryan.</hi> That neither Col. <hi>Turner</hi>'s Wife nor Sons knew of this Robbery, only that they helped him to remove the money away on Saturday morning. That the money was in the houſe on Fryday at night, when the Conſtable and Marſhal ſearched his houſe, but they had hid them. That Col. <hi>Turner</hi> being asked where the Jewels were on Saturday morning, ſaid, he did deliver them at ſix of the clock to <hi>VVhite</hi> in both the Bags. That the Carkanet of Rubies was not in thoſe Bags. That Col. <hi>Turner</hi> in the concluſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, That he had not done that he did, but that he did lately underſtand that another perſon was made Executor, and that he was reſolved to have ſomewhat.</p>

After Colonel <hi>Turner</hi> his Examination, Sir <hi>Tho. Alleyn</hi> told Colonel <hi>Turner,</hi> that the firſt part of Repentance was Confeſſion, the ſecond Reſtitution; and he being a Convict Perſon, and in all probability not likely to continue long in this world, it were much better for him to reſtore what was another mans, then to think to enrich his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by leaving them that which he knew was none of his: and that one peny of his own Eſtate left him, would continue longer with him then a pound of another bodies: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was preſſed to reſtore Mr. <hi>Tryan</hi> the reſt of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the Carkanet of Rubies and Diamonds yet in his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody. This had ſuch a preſent influence upon Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> that he ſaid he would immediately go and fetch the Carka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; which he accordingly did, and delivered the ſame into the hands of Sir <hi>Richard Rives,</hi> one of the Sheriffs.</p>
