            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But here we muſt obſerue this rule that the workes of the Trinity are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuided.</p>
               <p>Therefore that which is the Fathers worke is the worke alſo of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>That the Sonne of GOD doth the ſame workes that the Father doth, is already prooued: the ſame is to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed alſo of the holy Ghoſt, by the warrant of Gods word, as by that I read in the 139.

Chriſt the Sonne of God, and the holy Ghoſt, do gouerne all things as wel as God the Father.</p>
               <p>Now to the ſecond: that God by his prouidence gouerneth all and euery thing.</p>
               <p>There are very many that can wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly graunt, that God by his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence gouerneth all things in general, but that euery particularthing is ruled by the ſame, they deny: with theſe men therefore I minde to deale ſome what largely, though not ſo learnedly, as the cauſe requireth: (&amp; who is able to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle it worthily?)

as though God regarded vs not.</p>
               <p>The Periapatetickes, and other ſort of Philoſophers, broched another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, teaching that thoſe things which are aboue the Heauens, are mooued, guided and gouerned by God himſelf: but thoſe things that are vnder the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Moone, are gouerned partly by chance and fortune, partly by the counſailes and deuiſes of men, &amp; partly by a brutiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſenceles force of nature.</p>
               <p>There is a third opinion of the Stoicks, which is that all things are ruled by fate or deſtiny, that is by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret order and linke of cauſes: in which chaine, all things are ſo ſurely tied, that both God himſelfe and man are ſtraighted within thoſe bounds.</p>
               <p>This was a very dainty opinion in the iudgement of the Poets: who to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the weakenes of their God Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fained that he wept, for that he was ſo hindered by the force of deſtiny, that he could not ſet <hi>Sarpedo</hi> at liberty.</p>
               <p>The fourth opinion is <hi>Platoes,</hi> who graunteth that God by his prouidence ruleth all things in generall, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miteth to petty Gods,

               <p>But ſome of vs (euen of vs Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) flying one danger, run into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: &amp; for that they dare not deny that God by his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ruleth al things, yet will they not graunt, that by it, hée gouerneth euery particular thing, leaſt they ſhould thereby be driuen (as they think) to ſome abſurdities: thus whilſt they would auoide abſurditie, they commit impiety and fal away from the truth moſt dangerouſly: But farre bee this fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your heart (Right worſhipful) and that it may neuer poſſeſſe you: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid the cauſe that worketh it in them, which is ignorance of the word of God: and for that God in great mercy hath kindled in your heart a deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, quench not that godly deſire, in you, but purſue hotly with hearty and feruent prayer, after knowledge, and you ſhall finde it: and if you ſhall finde

But leauing Philoſophers let vs ſée what the Scripture teacheth vs: the firſt place I will vſe for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> proofe of this doctrine, I take out of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Hebrues</hi> the 1. Chapt. verſe. 3. where it is ſaid of the ſonne of God, that <hi>Hee beareth vp,</hi> that is, mooueth and gouerneth all things by his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie worde: hee that graunteth that he ruleth al things, excepteth no one thing from his gouernment: We may then well conclude out of this place of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17087:10"/>
God, that God gouerneth all, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing.</p>
               <p>But leaſt I ſhould leaue any ſtarting hole for the aduerſary to winde out at, let vs further ſée what the Scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> teacheth vs of the gouerning of euery particular thing by Gods prouidence.</p>
               <p>Neither will I heape vp many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but content my ſelfe with a fewe examples, out of which the truth of this doctrine may be gathered.</p>
               <p>And thus I do endeuour to prooue it briefly: All the creatures of God are either indued with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gift of frée choiſe, or elſe want this liberty of choiſe: they that haue it, are Angels, both good and euill, and men alſo both good and euill: they that want this liberty of choyſe, are all other liuing things created by God, &amp; alſo thoſe his creatures, which haue no life: and yet of all theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, God hath a ſpeciall care, ſo as he diſpoſeth of euery one of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> and the Pſalmes, do very often handle this argument, ſo that if I ſhould gather out of them all their proofes, I ſhould write out almoſt

               <p>Of the Angels, which I placed at the firſt amongſt theſe creatures, that haue the liberty of choice, I wil write now the leſſe, hoping that I ſhal haue this backe againe to view, poliſh, and inlarge: but their name teacheth vs that they are ruled by God him ſelfe, for they are called <hi>Angeli</hi> Angels, that is, meſſengers ſent from God: and in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the miniſters, and ſeruants of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for the firſt part, that is for the truth of this doctrine, that God by his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ruled al things in general, and euery particular thing in particular.</p>
               <p>Now I come to that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> place, namely to the vnfolding and anſwering of thoſe arguments which are made againſt this doctrine. The firſt argument they make is this: God cannot gouern all things generally, and euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and action without exceeding toile and griefe of mind: But it agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the nature of God, that hee reſt in quiet &amp; be free from all labors: Therefore God doth not gouerne all and euery particular thing.</p>
               <p>To this argument drawne thus from the nature of God, I anſwere, that their firſt propoſition is falſe, which is that God cannot gouerne all things generally and particularly without exceeding toile, and griefe of minde: but for that I will not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it as falſe, but ſhew the reaſons that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>eacheth, becauſe they are done with force. There is another ſort of actions which I called meane, whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings are of nature, but yet they cannot bée done vnleſſe they bee helped by ſome other meanes, as to eate, to drinke, to walke, and ſuch like. But now that, that God doth, hée doth without labour, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

neither is he trobled with griefes, but gouerneth all things according to the rule of his will: neither is there any thing more agréeable to the nature of God, then to gouerne, and preſerue the whole worlde, euen with the word of his power.</p>
               <p>A ſecond argument of theirs is this, It is an vnméete thing for God, and cleane repugnant to his nature, to entermeddle in filthy, and vncleane matters: but he cannot gouern euery ſeueral creature, and their actions, but he muſt entermeddle with many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane and filthy matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore he doth not gouerne them.</p>
               <p>I deny the ſecond propoſition, which is, that God cannot gouerne euery ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral creature &amp; their actions, but he muſt mingle himſelfe with many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, and filthy matters: For that amongſt the creatures, and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there are many vnclean things: this conſequence, though it be the ground of the propoſition is falſe, for although the power of God is in all his creatures, &amp; ruleth all, yet doth it not therefore follow, that the nature
