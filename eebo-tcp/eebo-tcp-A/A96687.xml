         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am ſorry for your owne ſake, being a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman reported to bee peaceable in your converſation, that you ſhould bee thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in other mens quarrells; eſpecially to father other mens falſhoods and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious jeeres and ſcoffes, whoſe ſpirits if you were ſo well acquainted with as my ſelfe and ſome others that came lately from <hi>New-England,</hi> as well as thouſands in the Countrey, you would bee more wary then to engage as you doe.</p>
            <p>But firſt for anſwer to your Preface, and then I conceive I have anſwered every word of yours in your ſeeming Treatiſe: And yet I would not bee miſtaken that any ſhould thinke I judge you una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to write ſuch a peece, for there is no ſolidity in it: but I am ſo well acquainted with this language and ſuch proceedings before ever I ſaw your face, as no man is or ever was better acquainted with the phraſe or writings of another, then I am with your chief animator to this undertaking, whom I call <hi>New-Englands Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> becauſe of his conſtant and many yeeres exerciſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in oppoſition to whatſoever hath been judged moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſafe for the weale-publick of the Country (from whence hee laſt came) either in Politicks or Eccleſiaſticks, being ever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114179:3"/>
to enjoy the common benefits of peace by government (which maintaines every man in his proper right) but never willing to beare any part of the charge in ſupporting the ſame, as appeared by his conſtant cavilling thereat when ever any rates came upon the country though never ſo eaſie and juſt.</p>
            <p>But to come to the occaſion of your printing the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which you ſay <hi>are the ſufferings that not onely my Brother Robert Child Doctor of Phyſick, with ſome Gentlemen and others have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their perſons and eſtates by Fines and impriſonment in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and falſe reports and feigned miracles bere, &amp;c.</hi> For anſwer, that your brother was in priſon, and for what I certified you at my firſt comming over; though to you grievous in regard of naturall affection, (which I honour where I finde in any;) Then alſo being occaſioned thereunto I freely imparted to you the Countries co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorable grounds of ſuſpecting his agency for the great Incendiaries of Europe, beſides the matter of fact for which hee was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yea that the very yeare hee came over, a gentleman in the country (Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> by name) was adviſed by letters from a forraign part that the Jeſuits had an agent that Sommer in <hi>New-England.</hi> And that the Countrey comparing his practiſe with the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence were more jealous of him then any; (though to mee he was a meere ſtranger) and therefore I marvell that Major <hi>Childe</hi> ſhould give me occaſion, and force mee to publiſh theſe things which I neither affect nor intended: but I ſhall forbeare in that kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not provoke.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>their eſtates being weakned by Fines,</hi> that is yet to prove: for though they were fined, yet the fines were not levied, nay ſo gentle was the cenſure of the Court, that upon the publike acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the offence the Fine was to bee remitted to all or any one of them ſo doing. <hi>And for falſe reports and feigned miracles fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented here to colour their unjuſt proceedings,</hi> as you terme it; I anſwer, your book is the firſt reporter of many things I here meet with, eſpecially as you lay them downe, as ſhall appeare more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
            <p>In the next place you ſay, <hi>They give out that my brother and others deſire a toleration of all Religions:</hi> This is the firſt time that ever I heard it ſo reported of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas you ſay <hi>they are accuſed to bee againſt all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment both in Church and Common weak:</hi> This I know to bee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114179:3"/>
falſe: for I heard them demand in Court the Presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and it was granted them. Beſides, before this demand in Court, at a private conference with an eminent perſon (who well hoped to have ſatisfied them) hee demanded of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners what Church government it was they would have? One of them anſwered, he deſired that particular government which Mr. <hi>John Goodwin</hi> in Colemanſtreet was exerciſed in. Another of them ſaid, hee knew not what that was: but hee for his part deſired the Presbyterian government. A third of them ſaid hee deſired the Epiſcopall government if it might bee, if not, the Presbyterian: And a fourth told mee himſelfe that hee diſclaimed any thing in the Petition that was againſt the government of the Churches in <hi>New-England, &amp;c.</hi> reſting and liking what was there done in that kind. Now the former three paſſages (and not without the latter) were all told mee by grave perſons in <hi>New-England,</hi> ſuch as I beleeve. And therefore if any ſo accuſe them I muſt needs cleare them: but withall teſtifie I never met with this accuſation againſt them before I read it in your booke.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>for their petitioning the Parliament;</hi> Take notice wee hold that no ſubject ought to bee reſtrained this libertie, and therefore count it no offence nor ever did, and therefore they were not committed for that.</p>
            <p>A fourth falſe report you terme, is, <hi>Their Petition brought from thence to bee preſented to the Parliament (which they had named Jones) in a ſhip called the Supply; being in a ſtorme neere Silly, out of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of conſcience the petition was torne and throwne over board: and that then the ſtorme immediatly ceaſed, and they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>louſly ſaved.</hi> To this I anſwer, I was not in the ſhip (I praiſe God) and therefore what I ſay in it muſt bee from others whom I judge truely godly, and of the moſt grave and ſolid perſons amongſt them; And Sir, let mee tell you, and the world in anſwer to you, I have heard the paſſage from divers, but never as you print it; and doe thinke verily your informers belie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they may have ſomewhat to cavill at. But though I had not thought to have entred upon a large anſwer to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: yet it being one of the heads of your Treatiſe, I ſhall bee larger in anſwering that then another thing; partly to vindicate Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>on</hi> who is much abuſed in your booke, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114179:4"/>
partly from their owne pen to ſhew the prophane carriage of the partie in the ſhip by their fearefull provoking the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to follow them with his terrours throughout the voyage from <hi>New-England to Silley,</hi> where they had a great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and yet nevertheleſſe to ſhew how they goe on ſtill to abuſe Gods mercy, patience and long ſuffering by this prophane title and ſtory colored by your ſelfe. And thus much for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your Preface. As for the foure heads of your book and the Poſtſcript, I ſhall anſwer them as they ariſe.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>An anſwer to the imperfect relation of the <hi>Hingam</hi> caſe.</head>
               <p>Were I not ſo well acquainted with our <hi>New-England</hi>-Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanders wayes, and what a puther hee made in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey about this buſineſſe, I ſhould ſtand amazed at the malice of men to ſee this brought againſt the government. To anſwer either this caſe or the next at length would ask ſo much paines, and bee ſo great a bulke, as their booke being but a two penny jeering Gigge, penned rather to pleaſe the fancy of common underſtandings, then to ſatisfie any ſolid judgements; would goe much further then ever the anſwer would bee like to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that ſo he might bemire us with a witneſſe. And if he can cauſe any reproach to lie upon us (whether juſt or unjuſt, that matters not) then hath hee hit the marke hee ſhoots at. And therefore to avoyd the many particulars would fall in a diſtinct anſwer by giving an account of the whole buſineſſe, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Reader to accept this generall.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Hingam</hi> were knowne to bee a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and induſtrious people, and ſo continued for many yeers; The Lord ſupporting them in the midſt of many ſtraights in their firſt beginnings, crowning their indeavours with his bleſſing, and raiſing them up to a comfortable and proſperous outward condition of life, and ſuch is their ſtate through Gods mercy and goodneſſe this day, living very plentifully. But Satan envying their happineſſe (the Lord permitting as it ſeemes) on a ſuddaine caſt a bone of diviſion amongſt them, which tooke mightily, to the great griefe and admiration of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114179:4"/>
their neighbours on every ſide; which controverſie indeed aroſe about the choyce of their Captaine as is related. But our Salamander living too neere them, and being too well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them, blew up this to ſuch an height by his continuall counſell and adviſe which the major part of the Towne follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their owne ſmart, and the great griefe and trouble of Church and Common-weale, as they not onely filled their Court with complaints againſt each other, and wearied out the chiefe Magiſtrates in place, but complained openly againſt one of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Deputie Governour, who upon hearing the Caſe thought good to bind ſome of them over to the Court; ſome ſubmitted and gave bond, others refuſed, and were ſent to priſon, &amp;c. This Gentleman, as on all other occaſions ſo in this particular much honored himſelfe, by leaving his place upon the Bench and going to the Bar, and would not bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to cover his head or take his place till the caſe was heard and ended, which continued many dayes, partly by reaſon of the great liberty the Court gave the Plaintiffes in regard it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon one of themſelves, (and I thinke the firſt caſe that ever befell in that kind;) but more eſpecially becauſe our Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander was got to <hi>Boſton,</hi> where though hee would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly ſhew himſelfe, yet kept cloſe in a private roome where they had recourſe unto him many dayes, yea many times a day for advice, and followed it to the utmoſt, to the great charge of the Countrey (which came to much more, as I have heard, then the hundred pounds fine which was laid upon them) in providing the diet of their Court.</p>
               <p>But the Court finding for the Defendant after much trouble in many dayes agitation fined the Plaintiffes in an hundred pound, and laid it upon ſundry of them in particular amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to their ſeverall demeanours in the action, and left the Deputie Governour to take his courſe with them, who onely reſted in the vindication of his name; which the Countrey ſo farre cleared, as not long after, their election day falling by courſe, they choſe him their Governour, a place not ſtrange to him, in which wee left him, having more often borne it then all others in that Government. And for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which befell them in their Church; whether the Court or the Churches I know not, but the one entreated divers of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114179:5"/>
the Elders to goe unto them, who through Gods mercy and bleſſing upon their endeavours prevented a diviſion amongſt them, though they could not at firſt ſettle things ſo well as they deſired. And thus much for anſwer to the <hi>Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But beſides all this take notice good Reader, that our Salamander wintred many moneths amongſt them, very gracious and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in their companies, and no doubt a great helpe in furthering their deſigne in their Remonſtrance, which brake forth not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his returne home the ſpring following: and indeed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had beene enough alone to have produced ſuch an effect; and therefore for my part ſo well knowing the man I cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it as many doe, aſſuring my ſelfe bee better knowes how to ripen ſuch fruit then all the Coſtermongers in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now let mee goe to the Title of the booke which hath its
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114179:7"/>
relation to the Petition aforeſaid; and after their Gigge called <hi>New-Englands Jones caſt up at London,</hi> they would make the world beleeve that <hi>divers honeſt and godly perſons are impriſoned in New-England for Petitioning for government in the Common-weale, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes of England, and either for deſiring admittance of themſelves and children to the Sacraments in our Churches, or elſe for leave to have Miniſters and Church government according to the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of England and Scotland.</hi> Now theſe charges are moſt notorious falſe, and ſo knowne, for I came not alone from <hi>New-England,</hi> but accompanied with an hundred perſons at leaſt, which I beleeve can teſtifie in the caſe. And therefore Major <hi>Childe</hi> take notice how you are abuſed by them to father ſuch deviliſh and ſlanderous reports as theſe.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, There were none committed for petitioning, but for their Remonſtrance and the many falſe charges and ſeditious inſinuations tending to faction and inſurrections ſleighting the government, &amp;c. And leſt any ſhould thinke (as I heare ſome doe) that the Court of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> hath dealt rigorouſly with them, and that the Petition is very faire and orderly, &amp;c. let the Reader know that ſuch thoughts muſt either proceed from great weakneſſe in not underſtanding or diſcerning the many groſſe charges in it, or elſe from partialitie or evill affection to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which they neither love nor know; for in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance they not onely defame the Government, but controule the wiſedome of the State of <hi>England</hi> in the frame of their Charter which is under the broad Seale of the Kingdome by charging the Government <hi>to bee an ill compacted veſſell.</hi> Secondly, they charge all the afflictions that have befallen the perſonall Inhabitants either by ſickneſſes on the land, or loſſes at Sea <hi>upon the evill of the Government.</hi> Thirdly, they goe about to perſwade the people, that all the priviledges granted and confirmed under the broad Seale to the Governour and Company of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets</hi> belong to all freeborne Engliſh men; which contrariwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely to the ſaid Governour and Company, and ſuch as they ſhall thinke meet to receive. Fourthly, they cloſely inſinuate into the mindes of the people (as the jealouſies of others) that theſe now in authoritie doe intend to exerciſe unwarranted dominion, and an Arbitrary Government abominable to Parliament, &amp;c. foretelling them of intolerable bondage, which is enough alone to ſtirre up a people to commotion. Fiftly, how doe they goe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114179:8"/>
about to weaken the authoritie of the Lawes of the place, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples reverence of and obedience to them in this their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, by perſwading the people that partly through want of the body of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lawes, and partly that through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency and ill frame of thoſe they have, <hi>they can expect no ſure injoyment of their lives and liberties under them:</hi> when as the State well knew the <hi>Engliſh</hi> body of Lawes was too heavy for us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as libertie is granted in our Patents to make our owne Lawes, ſo it is with this proviſo, that they bee as neere the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> as may bee, which wee underſtand as neer as our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will permit, which I ſhall ſpeake more of elſewhere. Sixtly, they falſly charge the Government with denying libertie of Votes where they allow them, as in choyce of Military officers, which is common to the non-Freemen with ſuch as are free. Seventhly, their ſpeeches in their Remonſtrance are charged to tend to Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by inſinuating into the peoples minds, <hi>That there are many thouſands ſecretly diſcontented at the Government, &amp;c.</hi> whereby thoſe that are ſo may bee emboldned to diſcover themſelves, and know to whom to repaire; and what greater meanes can bee uſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetle a ſetled people, and to kindle a flame in a peaceable Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, if the Lord prevent not, and Authoritie ſhould ſuffer ſuch things to paſſe uncenſured? Eighthly, they ſlander the Diſcipline of the Churches in the Countrey, and the civill Government alſo, by inferring that the frame and diſpenſations thereof are ſuch, as <hi>godly, ſober, peaceable men cannot there live like Chriſtians;</hi> which they ſeeme to conclude from hence, that <hi>they deſire libertie to remove from thence where they may live like Chriſtians:</hi> when as indeed our armes are open to receive ſuch both into Church and Common-weal, bleſſing God for their ſocietie. Ninthly, they doe in effect charge the Government with <hi>Tyranny in impreſſing their perſons to the warres, committing them to priſon, fining, rating them, &amp;c. and all unjuſtly and illegally,</hi> whereas no warre is undertaken, nor any Preſſe goes forth, but according to Law eſtabliſhed; but the thing they would have is that any <hi>Engliſh</hi> man may <hi>volens nolens,</hi> take his habitation in any Government, bee as free as the beſt, &amp;c. thus breaking all Order, Charters, and peace of Societies: for if he be <hi>Engliſh</hi> borne (by their principles) no Government may refuſe him be he never ſo peſtilent, whether Jeſuite or worſe. Tenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114179:8"/>
fellowſhip:</hi> whereas they cannot but know the contrary. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wee have nothing to doe to bring them to the Church, and cannot caſt out thoſe that were never within, yet privately wee performe the dutie of Chriſtians towards them, either in holding private Communion with ſuch as are godly, or reproving and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the reſt alſo as occaſion and opportunity offereth. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, that this dirt might ſtick faſt, and men might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily receive theſe injurious charges againſt the Government; in the concluſion they proclaime, <hi>That our brethren in England</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Independents) <hi>dee flee from us at from a Peſt.</hi> When as for my part I beleeve that if our brethren were with us they would cloſe with our practiſe, or at leaſt wee ſhould bee dealt more bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly withall, and then wee ſhould not only hearken to what counſel ſhould be of God, from them or any other in Gods way but bee willing to reforme any thing that is amiſſe either in Church or Common-weale. Twelfthly, that it may appeare theſe injurious charges are their owne apprehenſions, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes rather then jealouſies of any others, they have publiquely declared their diſaffection to the Government, in that being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Court to render account of their miſ-apprehenſions, and evill expreſſions in the premiſes, they refuſed to anſwer: but by appealing from the Government they diſclaimed the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, (what in them lay) before they knew whether the Court would give any ſentence againſt them or not: when as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their Charter injoyneth nor requireth any appeale, but have the power of abſolute Government by vertue thereof: but theſe ſeven Petitioners, whereof three are meere ſtrangers and have no proprietie within the Government (and a fourth then to depart and now departed from it) will not beare it as the reſt. And for my part if theſe foure that were Inhabitants were not drawne in by the three ſtrangers to make up the number of ſeven to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Commonweale, I ſhould wonder (well knowing their abilities otherwayes, eſpecially of ſome of them) there being no want of fit perſons if many thouſands diſcontented as they ſay about them upon ſuch a ſtraight; but I looke upon this ſpeech of theirs as tending rather to incite diſcontented perſons to repaire unto them, then having any realitie in it. And for the matter of appeale from <hi>New-England</hi> hither, which is three thouſand miles diſtant, it will bee found to bee deſtructive to them that there live:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114179:9"/>
for no Countrey can ſubſiſt without government, or repaire ſo farre to it; nor will any wiſe man accept a place in Government where hee ſhall bee expoſed to goe ſo farre to give account of his actions, though they bee never ſo juſt: But the beſt is, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is knowne (and it is their duty) to ſeeke the good of the ſubjects by all due meanes: and I doubt not (if ever tendred to them) but they will ſoone diſcover the miſchiefe intended by our adverſaries, or at leaſt like to enſue (if they prevaile) by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing thoſe hopefull beginnings of <hi>New-England</hi> in ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our priviledges at ſuch a time, when <hi>Englands</hi> are reſtored; but wee hope to ſhare with them rather by enlargement, being wee went out in thoſe evill times when the Biſhops were ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent being perſecuted by them, and in that wee ſuffered ſince with the Parliament in adhering to them to the loſſe of Ships, and Goods, &amp;c. But I ſhall reſt on God in what is ſaid, hoping the Reader will bee ſatisfied in point of our innocency in regard of the evills charged on us; and therefore to proceed.</p>
               <p>In the next place whereas they complaine of <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> one of them being to goe to Sea juſt when things were to bee heard, was required to give bond to ſtand to the award of the Court, leaving ſix partners behind him to pleade his cauſe; alſo Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> being a dweller in another Government and not there, being preſent at that ſame time was required to doe the like; which order they withſtood for an houre or thereabouts, and were that time under the Marſhalls cuſtody, but no ſooner advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they with our Salamander their Counſell, but hee adviſed them to give ſecurity, which they accordingly did, and ſo were diſmiſſed; now this I ſuppoſe was becauſe hee was to goe to Sea with them immediatly, which they accordingly did.</p>
               <p>Secondly, take notice that before Doctor <hi>Childe, &amp;c.</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the buſineſſe of the Remonſtrance was ended, and they cenſured by Fine, every one according to his particular offence, and carriage in managing the whole, and it is not our manner to puniſh twice for one offence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, take notice that the Government they charge was proved in open Court to bee according to the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and therefore not committed for Petitioning for that they had.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let the Reader know that the Presbyterian Government
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114179:9"/>
was as freely tendered them by the Governour in the open Court without any contradiction of any the Aſſiſtants or other, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ever I heard any thing in my life, though it appeareth that our Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander is not a little troubled at it, as I ſhall have occaſion to touch in my anſwer to the Poſtſcript, which I verily beleeve hee penned every word.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let the Reader take notice that Doctor <hi>Robert Childe,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Dand,</hi> were committed for certaine Papers upon cloſe ſearch of <hi>Dands</hi> Cloſet, there found the night before the Ship came away, which were far more factious &amp; ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then the former. Doctor <hi>Childe</hi> being committed becauſe one of the Coppies was under his knowne hand, another Coppy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mr. <hi>Dands</hi> hand, and both in his cuſtody; Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in that hee not onely offered to reſcue the Papers from the Officers that were ſent to make ſearch: but when hee ſaw that hee could not reſcue them, brake out into high ſpeeches againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: and amongſt other things ſaid, hee hoped ere long to doe as much to the Governors Cloſet, and doe as much to him as hee did for them, &amp;c. or to the like purpoſe. And now Major <hi>Childe,</hi> let the world and you take notice together wherefore your Brother &amp; thoſe honeſt &amp; godly perſons you pretend to ſpeak of were committed. Nor doe I beleeve that any people under the heavens that know what belongs to Government and have the power of it, would doe leſſe then the Magiſtrates there did. But what the event will bee God onely knowes; but this I know, they are in the hands of mercifull men, however they have beene abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or may by our Salamander (whoſe reports I often meet with) or by any other whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And for anſwer to their relation of the effects this Petition produced, much of it is falſe and anſwered before, the reſt not worthy the anſwering; as concerning the Elders, their long Sermons to provoke the Magiſtrates againſt them, &amp;c. no wiſe man will beleeve as they relate. And thus much for anſwer to the ſecond part of their Booke concerning the Petition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance.</p>

               <p>His uſe of Exhortation was twofold. Firſt, to ſuch as lived in the Countrey, to take heed how they went about any indirect way or courſe which might tend to the prejudice of the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt in the ſame, or the Governments of the land, which through Gods mercy was not onely in the hands of ſuch as truely feared the Lord, but according to his revealed will ſo far as we can judge. And therefore if any (though never ſo ſecretly or ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſhould goe about any ſuch thing, the Watchman of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that ſlumbreth not nor ſleepeth will not take it well at their hands: For He that hath brought his people hither, and preſerved them from the rage of perſecution, made it a hiding place for them whilſt hee was chaſtiſing our owne Nation amongſt other the Nations round about it, manifeſted his gratious preſence, ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently walking amongſt his Churches, and preſerving and proſpering our Civill State from forraigne plots of the late Archbiſhop and his confederates, and the domeſtick of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then where wee live; there was no queſtion to bee made but Hee would preſerve it from the underminings of falſe brethren, and ſuch as joyned with them: And therefore, ſaith hee, let ſuch know in the foregoing reſpect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this, ſaid hee, I ſpeake as a poore Prophet of the Lord according to the word of his grace in my Text, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in the proper ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt, belonged to that age of the Church mentioned in the Booke of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> yet it is written for our example and inſtruction: for God is the ſame ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, to day, and for ever; no leſſe carefull, no leſſe able, and no leſſe willing to ſave and deliver his people by ingaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in their caſe; and who can ſtand before him?</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, ſaith he, whereas divers our brethren are to goe for <hi>England,</hi> and many others to follow after in another Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, let mee direct a word of exhortation to them alſo; I deſire the gratious preſence of our God may goe with them, and his good Angels guard them not onely from the dangers of the Seas this Winter ſeaſon, but keepe them from the errours of the times when they ſhall arrive, and proſper them in their lawfull deſignes, &amp;c. But if there bee any amongſt you my brethren, as 'tis repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there are, that have a Petition to prefer to the High Court of Parliament (which the Lord in mercy goe on bleſſing to bleſſe as hee hath begun) that may conduce to the diſtraction, annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and diſturbance of the peace of our Churches and weakning the Government of the Land where wee live, let ſuch know, the Lord will never ſuffer them to proſper in their ſubtill, malicious and deſperate undertakings againſt his people, who are as tender unto him as the apple of his eye. But if there bee any ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you that are to goe, I doe exhort and would adviſe ſuch in the feare of God when the terrors of the Almightie ſhall beſet the Veſſell wherein they are, the Heavens ſhall frowne upon them, the billowes of the Sea ſhall ſwell above them, and dangers ſhall threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them, (as I perſwade my ſelfe they will) I would have them then to conſider theſe things: for the time of adverſitie is a time for Gods people to conſider their wayes. I will not give the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell was taken concerning <hi>Jonah,</hi> to take ſuch a perſon and caſt him into the Sea; God forbid: but I would adviſe ſuch to come to a reſolution in themſelves to deſiſt from ſuch enterpriſes, never fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ingage in them, and to caſt ſuch a Petition into the Sea that may occaſion ſo much trouble and diſturbance. But it may be hardneſſe of heart &amp; ſtoutneſſe of ſpirit may cauſe ſuch a perſon

or perſons with ſtiffe necks to perſiſt, and yet in mercy with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome pretious ones amongſt you, (as I perſwade my ſelfe there are many ſuch goe in each Veſſell) the Lord may deliver the Veſſell from many apparent troubles and dangers for their ſakes: but let ſuch know, the Lord hath Land judgements in ſtore for ſuch, for they are not now free (Hee being the God of the Land as well as of the Sea:) and if you turne to <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 36, 37. you ſhall there ſee how hee threatned to deſtroy ſuch as brought a falſe report upon his land with the Plague: and truely God hath ſtill Plagues in ſtore for ſuch as bring a falſe report upon his Church and people; Nay ſaid hee, I heare the Lord hath a deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell with the Sword of Peſtilence in that Kingdome, ſtriking here and there, as ſeemeth good unto him, (though not vehemently, bleſſed bee his name) and who knowes what the Lord will doe? and therefore I adviſe ſuch in the feare of God, and I ſpeak it as an unworthy Prophet of His according to that portion of his word I now ſpeake from, to lay theſe things to heart, for it is the Lord Jeſus hath ſaid, <hi>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>let them bee taken.</hi> And beleeve it for a truth, all thoſe that goe about by Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like craft and ſubtiltie to undermine the Churches of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, they ſhall all bee taken, even in the very ſnare and ginne they ſet for others.</p>

And when they were all wearied out and tired in their ſpirits, certaine well-diſpoſed Chriſtians called to mind the things delivered by Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> before mentioned, and ſeeing the Tempeſt ſtill to continue, thought meet to acquaint ſuch as were conceived to be meant by Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and that had a purpoſe to perſiſt in ſuch courſes, that they thought God called them now to conſider of the things delivered by him; &amp; hereupon a godly &amp; diſcreet woman after midnight went to the great Cabbin and addreſſed her ſpeech in ſobrietie and much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty to them, whereupon one of the two anſwered in theſe words, or to this purpoſe; Siſter I ſhall bee loath to grieve you or any other of Gods people with any thing I ſhall doe, and immediatly went to his Cheſt or Trunke, and tooke out a paper and gave it her, and referred it to the diſcretion of others to doe withall as they ſhould ſee good: which the woman not in a diſtracted paſſion (as they reported) ſhewed to Mr. <hi>Richard Sadler</hi> and others, who although they knew it was not the right Petition but that they were deluded, yet becauſe they judged it alſo to bee very bad, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving often ſeene it in <hi>New-England,</hi> but never liked the ſame, cut it in peeces as they thought it deſerved, and gave the ſaid peeces to a <hi>Seaman</hi> who caſt them into the Sea.

Whereupon they to ſhew their reſpect to the Parliament, ſent mee to render a reaſon thereof, which I ſtill attend till their more weighty occaſions will permit them to heare. But when I came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I found that <hi>Gorton</hi> had enlarged his complaints by publiſhing a booke called <hi>Simplicities defence againſt Seven-headed Policy, &amp;c.</hi> which being full of manifold ſlaunders, and abominable falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods; I tooke my ſelfe bound in duty to anſwer it, as I did by that Treatiſe he mentioneth, called <hi>Hypocriſie <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmasked,</hi> which was but an anſwer to <hi>Gorton</hi> as this is to him, being neceſſitated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in Vindication of the Country, whoſe Agent I am, though unworthy.

               <p>Next that hee might ſtill turne our innocent ſimplicity into po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, hee takes advantage where none is, and layes hold on a requeſt of mine, which I muſt ſtill proſecute (maugre his malice) and I truſt in God the Parliament will bee ſenſible of it <hi>viz.</hi> That the Committee <hi>would take into conſideration how deſtructive it will bee to the wel-being of our Plantations and proceedings there (which are growing up into a Nation) here to anſwer the complaints of ſuch Malignant ſpirits as ſhall there bee c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

And theſe are to governe according to their Lawes made and eſtabliſhed, and not according to their wills.
