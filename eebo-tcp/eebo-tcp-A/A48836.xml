            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>Then those Men, when they saw the
Miracle which Iesus did, said,
Of a truth this is that Prophet that
should come into the world.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Text is the Conclusion of
a Story that reaches from the
beginning of the Chapter to
this Verse.</p>
            <p>The persons concerned in it
were of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation: a
Nation antiently famous and flourishing; but
at that time, under the yoke of a <hi>Roman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest:
from which they yet hop't for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
by a <hi>Prophet,</hi> whom they lookt for about
that time to come into the World.</p>
            <p>In this Critical time, comes our Lord <hi>Iesus</hi>
to shew himself; poor and conteptible to see to,
but withal so <hi>mighty in word and deed,</hi> that many
believed him to be that Prophet; the Rulers
knew not what to think of him, and the People
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61309:3"/>
flockt after him in multitudes, which way soever
he went.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter He went over the <hi>Sea</hi> of
<hi>Galilee</hi> (so they call it, though in truth 'tis but a
<hi>Lake)</hi> the People, about 5000 of them, went
about the Lake to meet him. The place where
they found him was Desert, they were farr from
any house or home, what Provisions they
brought with them were spent, and they seemed
to be in no small distress; which He merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Considered, and miraculously Relieved.
Out of that small pittance which one<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Vers. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Lad</hi> had
brought with him, He furnished a sufficient
meal for 5000 persons, and caused twelve Baskets
to be filled with those Fragments they had
left.</p>
            <p>This they all saw, and were amaz'd at the
thing, and magnified the Person, whom they
could Judg to be no other than what himself
profest that He was, namely, that He was <hi>That
Prophet that should come into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Judgment of theirs, how Reasonable
it was on their part, and what the Use of it should
be to us, are the things I am now to consider.</p>
            <p>The Reason of their Judgment stands briefly
thus: They lookt for a Prophet to come about
that time; and that he should make himself
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61309:3"/>
known to 'em by Miracles: They had heard
a great Fame of Christ, and now they saw
him do a great Miracle; Therefore they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that He must be that Prophet.</p>
            <p>First, That the <hi>Iews</hi> did look for one to come
into the World, one <hi>that should be Born</hi> of their
Nation; a great <hi>Prophet,</hi> a <hi>Messias,</hi> one Anointed
of God, for the Revealing of his Will, and for the
Redemption of his People; this is acknowledg'd
on all hands. It was a chief Article of the Jewish
Faith, the very <hi>Hope</hi> and Expectation <hi>of Israel:</hi>
For, <hi>to them were committed the Oracles of God;</hi> in
which they had Promises and Prophecies of him,
almost from the beginning of the World, to the
end of their Scriptures. The time would fail
me, if I should go about to reckon them. But
methinks a short reckoning may serve, when I
consider, that <hi>Moses</hi> to these Jews was <hi>instar
omnium:</hi> He was the Man <hi>in whom they did
trust,</hi> and he Prophesied of such a Messias to
come, <hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. 15, <hi>&amp; 18. vers.</hi> 'Tis a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Text, and therefore I quote you both the
place and the words. <hi>Verse 15. Moses</hi> speaks to
the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> in his own words, <hi>The Lord
thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the
midst of thee, of thy Brethren, like unto me, unto him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61309:4"/>
shall ye hearken:</hi> and then to assure them, that
he said not this of himself, he repeats the words
that God spoke to him upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to
this purpose, verse 18. <hi>I will raise them up a Prophet
from among their Brethren like unto thee.</hi> Now,
that Christ was one of their Brethren, the Jews
cannot but acknowledg: and that Christ was
like unto <hi>Moses,</hi> we Christians are able to shew
them. But to spare us that trouble, they say,
this Text was not meant of the Messias. Of
whom then? why, of such Prophets as God
would raise up from time to time in his Church.
But there were many such Prophets, and the
Text speaks expresly but of one: whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Aben Ezra</hi>
               <note n="*" place="marg1">In their Comments on the place.</note> will have to be <hi>Ioshua</hi> the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
of <hi>Moses. Abraham Seba</hi>
               <note n="*" place="marg2">In their Comments on the place.</note> sayes, it is intended
of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> But neither This, nor That,
nor any other Prophet, can fill up the Character
of this person; of whom God sayes, he shall be
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>like unto thee: Moses</hi> sayes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he shall
be <hi>like unto me.</hi> For never was there any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>like unto Moses,</hi> Deut. xxxiv. 10. nor
ever will be, sayes <hi>Maimonides,</hi> except the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
<hi>who,</hi> sayes he<note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Teshuba</hi> Cap. 9.</note>, <hi>shall be a great Prophet, and like
to our Master Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may seem strange, that our Modern Jews,
who so passionately dote on the hopes of a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61309:4"/>
Messia, should be so loath to hear of him in this
Prophesie. But there is no strangeness in it, to
him that considers the Witchcraft of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
They think themselves bound to find
another sense of the words, because the Apostles
of Christ have quoted them in this sense. St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
Act. iii. 22. St <hi>Steven,</hi> Act. vii. 37. both of
them, in express terms, applying this Prophesie
to Christ. Not to say that others also do it in
general words; namely, <hi>Philip,</hi> Joh. i. 45. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in the xxvi. &amp; xxviii. Chap. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> Nay, our
Saviour himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> v. 45. telling the Jews,
<hi>that Moses wrote concerning him.</hi> All which
Quotations in the New Testament, as they do
prejudice the Modern Jews, against the true
understanding of this Prophesie; so they plainly
prove, that it was thus understood by their
Forefathers: For else it had been a vain thing
for the Apostles to go about to prove Christ to
be the Messias, out of such a Text as those Jews
understood in a different sense: Especially when
there were so many other Texts of Scripture,
which the Jews do acknowledg to be meant of
the Messias, that could have been as easily
alledg'd by them, and as aptly applyed to
Christ, as this Prophesie which is now in
Question.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61309:5"/>
For the proof of what I say, I shall produce
two or three such Texts; and my choice shall
be of those, that not only foretold that a Messias
was to come, but also markt out the time when
he was to be expected: <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 10. is <hi>Iacobs</hi>
Prophesie, that <hi>The Scepter shall not depart from</hi>
Juda, <hi>till</hi> Shilo <hi>come;</hi> that is, <hi>there shall never
cease to be Kings and Princes of the house of</hi> Juda,
<hi>till the Messias come:</hi> So both the <hi>Targums</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it; and so does <hi>Onkelos,</hi> whose Paraphrase is
of greatest authority among the Jews, and who
himself lived about 40 years before Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation.
Another Prophesie there was, but
along time after this; it was foretold when the
second Temple was building, that <hi>The desire of
the Nations,</hi> in <hi>Haggai; The Lord whom they
sought,</hi> in <hi>Malachi;</hi> should <hi>come,</hi> and that <hi>suddenly,
to that Temple.</hi> The texts are <hi>Haggai</hi> ii. 7. &amp;
<hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 1. Both which places are clearly meant
of the Messias, and the latter of them is so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>
               <note n="*" place="marg1">In their Comments on the places.</note> and <hi>David Kimchi</hi>
               <note n="*" place="marg2">In their Comments on the places.</note>, two
of the learnedest Blasphemers of Christ in the
Jewish Nation.</p>
            <p>I shall offer but one Testimony more, and
it is from that Prophet, whom I think no man,
without invincible obstinacy, can read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
and not be a Christian; so unquestionable he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61309:5"/>
is for his Authority, so evident in his Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so punctual in the Circumstances of them:
I mean the Prophet <hi>Daniel;</hi> who bewailing the
desolation of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the 70 years Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of his Nation, was told by an Angel they
should soon be restor'd, and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> be rebuilt.
But farther, that after 7 times 70, that is, after
490 years, from the going forth of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
for the rebuilding of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they
should be a Nation no more; That within the
last 70 of these years, the Messias should come,
<hi>the holy One should be Anointed; Dan.</hi> ix. 24. and
that he should be <hi>cut off,</hi> but <hi>not for himself,</hi>
Verse 26. and then, that a <hi>Prince should come,</hi>
and <hi>destroy the holy City and the Sanctuary,</hi> as
there it follows in the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>How Easie a thing was it for any considering
man in Christs daies, to Reckon within a small
matter of those 490 years? I say, within a small
matter; because there might be some doubt
where to fix the Beginning of that reckoning:
whether it should begin at the First Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the rebuilding of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> or, at the
Last, which was about 50 years after. Which
possibly was the cause, why R. <hi>Nechonia ben
Hakkana,</hi> who lived about 50 years before
Christs Incarnation, said, as <hi>Grotius</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">De verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Christ. Relig. l. 5. §. 14.</note> tells us,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61309:6"/>
(for I know not his Author) we are now
within 50 years of the Messias; and R. <hi>Iose,</hi>
who lived about 50 years after Christs death,
said, according to R. <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Caphtor,</hi> we are
now past the time of the Messia.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that the 100 years between these,
was a time of great expectation, of some extra
ordinary Person to come into the World:
which Expectation began in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and from
thence it spread even all the World over.
Among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> there were strange Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of an Universal King that was then to be
born; as may appear from <hi>Cicero</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">L. 1. Epist. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> l. 2. de Divinatione.</note>, and <hi>Virgil</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Eclog 4.</note>,
from <hi>Suetonius</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">De Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siano, c. 4.</note>, and <hi>Tacitus</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Hist. l. 4.</note>, in their several Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
Among the <hi>Iews</hi> it was a Question in every
mans mouth, <hi>where is he that should be born?</hi>
so the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to <hi>Iohn Baptist, Art thou he?</hi> and
so the <hi>Baptist</hi> to our Saviour, <hi>Art thou he that
should come?</hi> so the People among themselves,
<hi>Is not this that Prophet?</hi> They were at it upon
every Occasion, and dearly they paid for it at
last. For they put the Nations about them all
into a ferment with these Discourses, and then
into a rage with their Commotions, which could
never be laid but with the Destruction of their
Temple and Government; according to those
Prophesies, <hi>which being read to them in their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61309:6"/>
Synagogues every Sabbath day,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Act. xiii. 27.</note> saith,
<hi>they fulfil'd, because they understood not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for those obstinate wretches, whom
God suffered to outlive that Destruction, when
the terrour of it was a little over, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to recollect themselves, and to consider what
hope they had left of the Promise; the <hi>Scepter</hi>
being now departed from <hi>Iuda,</hi> there being no
<hi>Temple</hi> left, and the 490 <hi>years</hi> long since expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
what a Confusion they were in, 'tis not
possible to express, nor easie to imagine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reading of their <hi>Talmud,</hi> where<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin, c. Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek.</note> in the 4th
part, 4th. Book, 11th. Chap. you may find them
casting up among themselves, what hopes they
had left of their Messias. One reflects upon that
Prophesie of the School of <hi>Elias,</hi> that the World
should last 6000 years; 2000 years before the
Law<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>, and 2000 under the Law, and 2000 un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Messias: which makes well for us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ came much about the year 4000;
but made ill for them, because that year was
then past and gone. Another makes mention
of two old Prophesies, that the Messias should
come after 85 Jubilees, that is, about the year
4200; but those Prophesies gave them no
comfort, that year also being past and gone.
A third said, all our prefixed times are at an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61309:7"/>
end; a fourth, that the Messias was come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
and lived somewhere <hi>incognito;</hi> a fifth,
wisht the bones of him broken that should
keep any more reckoning of time. A strange
and a certain accomplishment of that most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Prophesie<note n="*" place="margin">Deuter. xxviii. 28, 29.</note> concerning the state of the Jews
after their rejection of the Messiah; that <hi>God
would sinite them with madness, and blindness, and
astonishment of heart; that they should grope at
noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness;</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
that ought not to be lightly past by, but
I must not go beyond my line.</p>
            <p>I have shewed, that our Prophet was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
and that a time was set for his coming, and
that in Christs daies that time was come. Now
what could the Jews desire more but some To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to know him by? And such a Token was
this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in my Text. It signifies properly a
Sign, though we translate it a Miracle; which
obliges me to shew what a Miracle is, and
how fitly it was ordein'd to be the Sign of the
great Prophet.</p>
            <p>A Miracle, according to the derivation of the
word, is such a work as is apt to raise Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Admiration in us. And admiration pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the ignorance of causes. Therefore
Fools wonder at many things, because they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61309:7"/>
know the causes of few things: Wise men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
at those things which proceed from oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
causes in nature, though the things are
very usual and ordinary: All men admire at those
things which are unusual and extraordinary;
which if they also exceed the whole power of
nature, so far as any man is able to judge of it, then
they are properly and strictly called Miracles.</p>
            <p>In every work, by the laws of Nature, there
must be an Active cause naturally able and ready
to work; and there must be a Passive matter
fitly disposed for it: without both which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be done.</p>
            <p>If any thing be done without either of these,
then it is said to be Supernatural. 1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> On the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
part, when either there is no matter at all,
as in the Creation of the world out of nothing;
or, when there is such a matter as has no fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for such a use, as it was in the Creation,
and will be at the Resurrection, of living man
out of the dust of the Earth. 2ly. In respect
of the Agent, when the work is above the
reach of any natural cause, above the power
of any Creature that we can know of, as the
staying of the Sun in <hi>Ioshuah</hi>'s daies; or when
no second cause is imployed in it, or such a cause
as has no disposition for it, no activity but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61309:8"/>
what is Supernaturally given it; in all such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
a work is said to be Miraculous.</p>
            <p>This kind of work God is pleased to make
use of, as the Seal of his Commission to any
Person, as the Attestation of his hand to any
Doctrine: so that if any Person or Doctrine
be Blameless in other respects, and only Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
for its Authority; it sufficiently clears
its Authority to be from God, that he sends
it, or suffers it to come to us, with the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of Miracles.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Moses,</hi> being sent from God to the people
of <hi>Israel,</hi> was appointed to take two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
along with him; namely, two or three
Signs, to assure that captious people, that he
was truly a Prophet sent from God. First he
turns his Rod into a Serpent, and then that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
into a Rod again; he makes his hand in
an instant become leprous, and immediately
restores it again; he takes up water out of the
River, and poures it out perfect blood upon
the ground.</p>
            <p>Thus also, that Prophet <hi>like unto Moses, Deut</hi>
xviii. 15. was promised to come with signs like
him, Verse 21, 22. To the same effect are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Texts of the old Testament. But I
think that one is enough, if I can show that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61309:8"/>
the Jews did believe it, that they depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and were ready on all occasions to exact
this proof of a Messias. It is not unlike, that
the Devil himself (who is certainly a
great Textuary) had some thought of this,
when he tempted our Saviour to command
the stones to become bread. But as for the
Jews, it was unquestionably their way; which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> observes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 21. <hi>the Iews require
a sign;</hi> tell them of their Prophet, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
they call for a Sign. How often were
they upon these termes with our Saviour? He
could be no Messias for them, unless he would
shew 'em a Sign. Though some of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand were resolv'd not to be convinc'd
with it, yet none of 'em were to be satisfied
without it; nay not without many signs, as
he tells them, Joh. i. 5.<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. iv. 49.</note> 
               <hi>Except ye see signs and
wonders, ye will not believe.</hi> And 'tis observable
of <hi>Barcozba,</hi> that famous Impostor, who set
up for a Messias their own way, pretending
to make 'em a great flourishing People, which
so won him their hearts, that for a while they
generally adher'd to him; yet at last distrusting
him for want of success, they put him to death
only for want of a sign. Which though <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Hilcheth Melachim, c. 11.</note>denies, as also he does this Doctrine,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61309:9"/>
for fear of being prest with the undeniable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of our Saviour; yet the <hi>Talmud</hi> affirms
both these, as to that of <hi>Barcozba</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>in</hi> Sanhedrin.</note>, IV. 4. 11.
And as to this Doctrine<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Bera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choth c. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emathe korin.</note> I. 1. 1. as also the
<hi>Midrash Coheleth,</hi> c. 1. teaching, that <hi>all past Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
shall be as nothing in comparison of the
Miracles of the Messias.</hi> Which being the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Tradition of the Jews, founded in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of God, deriv'd to them in the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of Scripture, which Scriptures were read to
them every Sabbath day; it is no wonder that
the Jews did set their hearts on this way of
tryal.</p>
            <p>It remains to shew, how Christ did answer
their Expectation. Who as he was a Prophet
above all other Prophets, so his Miracles were
farr above all other Miracles. Never any one
did Miracles like him, even his Enemies being
Judges; no nor all that ever were before him
according to their own computation. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all the Prophets before him, in three or four
thousand years, did but 74 Miracles, besides
<hi>Moses</hi> who did 76 if their reckoning<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>v. Menas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seh ben Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s Concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, Part. 1. Q. 11. in <hi>Deut.</hi>
               </note> were true;
Our Saviour alone in three or four years time at
most, did more than it was possible to keep
account of; insomuch that as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> says<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. xxi. 25.</note> in a
proverbial expression, if they were all to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61309:9"/>
reckoned together, <hi>the whole world could not contain
the Books that should be written.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatsoever any man else did of this kind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prophet or Apostle, he did it by a borrowed
and limited Power; which he could neither commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to others, nor exercise it himself, but by
Gods especial appointment: but for Christ, who
had <hi>the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him;</hi> he
did what he pleased, and when he pleased, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or by others, being determin'd by nothing but
by his own Goodness and Wisdom.</p>
            <p>What part of the Creation, doth not afford us
an instance of his Power? who had the blessed
Angels at his call, and the damned Spirits sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to his will; who commanded the seas and
the winds and they obeyed him; who guided
the Fishes in the deep, which way he pleased; but
especially for men, that were his peculiar charge,
he provided against all their necessities and wants,
their infirmities and miseries. He fed them by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
he heal'd them by Miracle, of sundry di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
which were otherwise incurable: of inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Dropsies and Leprosies, of a Palsie of 38 years,
of Blindness from ones birth; what could one do
more, but to raise men from the dead? and thus
he did divers, particularly <hi>Lazarus</hi> who had lain
four daies buried in the grave.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61309:10"/>
And these things he effected, as well absent as
present, in an instant as by sensible degrees;
by the applying of his hand, by the touch of his
garment, by the word of his mouth, by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his will; to shew that any means would
serve, that no means were necessary, that all times
and places were alike, to the Soveraign vertue
that he imploy'd in the working of his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
            <p>Which works being so evident testimonies
of a Divine Authority, and being design'd for so
universal a Benefit, it was necessary that they
should be as evidently and universally known.
And this our Saviour seems to have considered in
all his Miracles. If any of them were done Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
which were but few in comparison, he
commanded them not to be spoken of, that there
might be no suspicion of Imposture. But for the
generality of his works, he did them Openly and
publiquely; before multitudes, or in throngs; at
Feasts, or in Synagogues, or in the streets, and in
the open Sun; many of them in the Temple, and
that at Passeover times, in the face of his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Enemies, and before a whole Nation of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
            <p>This Miracle in my Text, was done in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
but it was in the presence of 5000 persons;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61309:10"/>
whom the Fame of Christs works had drawn
thither to observe him, and therefore they could
not well be surprized in the manner of it: nor
could they be deceived in the Action it self; for
they saw, and felt, and tasted the effects of it. He
fully satisfied their hunger; and so farr their
hopes, that they determined to look for no other
Messias; being assur'd that this was He, <hi>This of
a Truth is that Prophet that should come into the
world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with the reason of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and should next proceed to the Use of it;
but that I am sensible of an Objection in the way,
which some have started at this distance of time,
to question the Judgment of that age, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Infidelity of this. I am sorry there
should be any cause to mention it; that instead
of carrying on the Building of God, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forward the duty of Christian life, we must
be put to answer those Atheists that stand peck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Foundation. But we must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
since God is pleas'd to suffer it. It is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
World that we live in, and alwaies so
much Vice, so much Unbelief. Perhaps too, we
are not farr from that time, of which Christ saies,
<hi>when the Son of Man comes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk xviii. 8.</note> 
               <hi>shall he find Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth?</hi> If so, we are not like to prevail
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61309:11"/>
much against the Atheists. Howsoever we are
bound to do our indeavour, and not to leave
their Arguments unanswer'd, though in effect we
only leave their Persons the more unexcusable.</p>
            <p>Their Objection is, that these Evangelists be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christs followers, might boldly assert things
for the honour of their Master and his Cause,
which for ought we know have been as stifly
denied by the Opposite parties. I propound this
Objection in behalf of a sort of men whose In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
is commonly better then their Reading.</p>
            <p>For whosoever is any whit skill'd in Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
must needs know, that the Ground of this
Objection is false; Jews, Heathens, Mahometans,
as many as write of this matter, do all confess,
that our Saviour did work Miracles. For the
<hi>Mahometans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. Rycaut <hi>of the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Empire,</hi> l. 2. c. 2, 3.</note> they are <hi>but of yesterday, and know
nothing:</hi> only this they say in general, for the
brutish proof of their sensual Religion; that as
Christ came with Miracles, so <hi>Mahomet</hi> came
with the Sword. As for <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> who
in Christs time, and after it, abounded with Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Learned men; there is no reason to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine,
but if they had had any Colour for it,
they would as fiercely have denied Christs Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
with their Pens, as they persecuted his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
with Fire and Sword. But seeing it was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61309:11"/>
in vain to Deny those things, which so many
thousands knew to be true; and the memory of
which, was continually revived, by those fresh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
which the Primitive Christians wrought
in Christs name: therefore either they chose to
take no notice of them at all in their Writings;
or if they mention'd Christs Miracles, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd
them to Magick or Diabolical Causes.
And what can one ask more of an Enemy, as
to matter of Fact; then that he should either
speak out and confess it, or shew by his silence
that he knows not how to deny it? No <hi>Iew</hi>
can with reason deny Christ's Miracles; since
they are confest by his own <hi>Talmud</hi> in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
specially<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Aboda Zara.</note> in the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
               <hi>Part,</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Book.</hi>
Nor no <hi>Heathen</hi> could in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s or <hi>Iustin
Martyr</hi>'s daies; unless those Learned men were
monstrous silly and impudent, who durst<note n="*" place="margin">Iustin M. <hi>in</hi> Apol. 2. Tertull. <hi>in</hi> Apol. c. 21. v. Euseb. Hist. l. 2. c. 2.</note> tell
their Emperours, they might finde proofs of
them in <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Records which were then at <hi>Rome.</hi>
They were such irrefragable Proofs, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Jew nor Heathen had any thing to say to
them, but this, that they were done by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick;</hi>
which may be said of any thing, and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
just nothing: or, that they were done by <hi>Evill
Spirits,</hi> which will not serve the turn of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist,
who is as unwilling to believe that there is
a Devil, as that there is a God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61309:12"/>
But (besides these Quotations, which it were
easie to multiply, if it were so proper for this
place;) besides these, we have the greatest As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that in reason can be wisht for, of the
truth of these Miracles. For what assurance can
be had at such a distance, concerning things done
1600 years agoe? The best that can be expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is a History written by some credible Persons
that lived in those times. And such a History
this is, or there is no such in the World. For
that it was written by them whose Names it
bears, no Adversary ever question'd, and all
Christians have acknowledg'd, that have written
from Age to Age ever since. Nor is it questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
that the things here written are the same that
were taught by the twelve Apostles: which Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
our Saviour took along with him to be the
constant Witnesses of all his actions; and they
profess to have been present with him at most
of the things that are here Written. Men so farr
from being suspected of any Deceit, that their
Simplicity and Ignorance has been their only
Accusation. And that so many, such men, should
conspire together, to fain incredible things, and to
impose them upon the faith of Mankind: Why
they should do this, without any Temptation of
Honour, or Wealth, or Preferment; nay with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61309:12"/>
certain Assurance of persecution, and misery, and
cruel death, which their Master foretold them,
and they lookt for no other, and they were not
mistaken in this: How they durst Adventure
such stories with such Circumstances, of time,
places, and persons, which they knew certainly
would be sifted, and might easily have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
if they had not been true; all this were as
prodigiously strange in Them, as it would be
now in Us, if we should not believe them.</p>
            <p>But say, it were possible that they might be
deceived themselves in Christs Miracles, yet sure

then to 500 of his followers at once, most of
whom were alive when these things were written:
but especially to those twelve Apostles, he shew'd
himself by many Infallible proofs; being Seen
of them, and Conversing with them, for forty
daies; at the end whereof, being together with
him upon Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> after much discourse
they Beheld him taken up in a bright cloud, which
carried him out of their sight.</p>
            <p>Now is it reasonable to imagine, that all these
men, all this while, had no use of their Reason,
or had not so much as Common sense about
them? For if that Relation was false, then one
of these things must be true: that either they

               </gap>
he can be no Atheist; he must assent to all this
which I am about to say. That a poor Young
man, of the Meanest birth and breeding, of a
most hateful Nation, and hated himself by that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61309:13"/>
Nation, for taking upon him to be a Prophet
sent 'em from God, for which he was laid hold
of, and put to a bitter and most shameful Death.
That after his death, a few Fishermen and others,
as Mean as himself in all Circumstances, should
still Proclaim that he was that Prophet: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it with a Story of his Resurrection, and
with loud boasts of Miracles wrought by him
and his Followers, all which were utterly False;
Promising all them that would believe in him,
nothing in this world but Affliction and cruel
Death, which their own Sufferings prov'd to be
True: That such men, with no other Charms,
should work such a Faith, in all the Wisest part
of Mankind; and that with so lasting an Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as Time has not been able to deface, no, nor
Vice neither, which is the thing that makes Them
desire to deface it. That so Impregnable a Faith
should be bottom'd on so foul an Imposture,
(Pardon me great God that I lend breath to their
Blasphemies) 'tis a thing so prodigiously Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
that it could never enter into any man's
head, unless he were for his Lust's sake as great
a Monster of Credulity, as I have shew'd him, in
other respects, to be a very Monster of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61309:14"/>
I fear this Discourse may have been larger then
the Occasion; nay I hope it rather in this place;
and would to God that it were wholly Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that there were no more Unbelievers in This
world, then there will be in the Other; and then I
am sure there would be Few enough.</p>
            <p>But I have now done with Them, and am to
speak to your selves; to You that believe the holy
Scriptures, &amp; desire to make a profitable Use of 'em.
And the Use of this Scripture is, to observe what
<hi>these men</hi> in my Text, did according to Reason, and
(allowing for the difference of Circumstances) to do
the same Thing our selves. Namely, if we have any
Prophet yet to come, and the promise of Miracles to
know him by; then it is our Duty, when we see
those Miracles, to acknowledge that Prophet: but
if we have no such Prophet to expect, and no
more Miracles to look for; then it behoves us to
make much of those Miracles, and that Prophet
that we have already, and to look for No other.
This appears to be the natural consequence of my
Text.</p>
            <p>It hath been proved, that Christ is that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
of whom God has foretold us from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the World: and this Prophet has told
us,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. xxviii. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, I am with you to the end of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But have we any other to look for? any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61309:14"/>
other Prophet to come? any farther Miracles to
know him by? It should seem that we have:
For Christ saies words to that purpose; and
he saies it not lightly, but he laies great weight
upon it, <hi>Behold,</hi> saies he<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. xxiv. 24, 25. Which Text is thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the Fathers, <hi>Chrysostom, Austin,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>I tell you of this
before. There shall arise false Christs and false
Prophets, and shall show great Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
insomuch that (if it were possible) they
shall deceive the very Elect.</hi> Particularly, 2 Thess.
ii. 9. <hi>That Son of perdition; whose coming shall
be after the working of Satan, with all power,
and Signs, and lying wonders.</hi> So likewise,
1 Tim. iv. 1. <hi>The Spirit speaks expresly, that
thus it shall be in the Latter times.</hi> All which
things are confirmed by other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
and are applyed by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Beast; that hath <hi>horns like a Lamb, but
speaks like a Dragon:</hi> Whose Miracles are set
forth, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii. 13. &amp; xvi. 14. &amp; xix. 20. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That the first Beast which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
with seven Heads, was the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and
Imperial <hi>Rome,</hi> I think all Interpreters do agree.
Whether the second Beast be the Papal <hi>Rome,</hi>
it is not our business now to enquire, let them
see to it that are her Worshippers and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.
But it is our business to know whom
to beware of; and Christ has warn'd us of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61309:15"/>
some body that shall pretend to Miracles,
and we know of none, but the Papal <hi>Rome,</hi>
that does pretend to them. She makes it one
of her Marks, and vaunts that she is to be
known by her Miracles.</p>
            <p>But what then? did not Christ promise
Miracles to his Church? and ought not His
Promise to be made good? It is most true,
that he did promise, and that he has perform'd,
we have sufficient proofs of it, both in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and in the Records of the Primitive
Church. For it was necessary that our great
Prophet should be made known to us; as
well in his Doctrine, as in his Person; that
the Christian Faith should be planted and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Miracles. But when this Doctrine
was written and publisht, and where this Faith
was planted and generally received; Then
there was no such necessity;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>v. Ambros.</hi> in 1 Cor. xii. <hi>in fine.</hi>
               </note> Then it was
enough to say, <hi>thus it is written;</hi> which Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
were as obligatory to all them that had
received this Doctrine, as if they had been
preacht to them severally by persons risen from
the dead. Of which those Fathers were so
throughly satisfied that lived in those times,
when most part of the world was already
converted; that they plainly profest, that now
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61309:15"/>
the time of Miracles was at an end. They
are few and rare now, if any, saith <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
in <hi>Hom.</hi> 4. on <hi>Mat.</hi> There are more
feign'd ones amongst false Christians, then
true ones amongst the true; saith the Author
of the Imperfect work, <hi>Hom.</hi> 49. 'Tis enough
for Christians, that the old Miracles are read
to them, saith St. <hi>Austin</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">De Civ. Dei l. 22. c. 8, 9, 10.</note>; and for Heathens,
that Miracles are yet done by us, though not
so Frequently, nor so Manifestly, as in former
times.</p>
            <p>Little did these good men think, that within
some Ages after they were dead, and in those
places where there were no Heathens to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
there should arise a sect of Christians
more abounding with Miracles in some one
age, than were ever seen in all ages of the
world before: and the Reason is plain, for
those Fathers never dreamt of those new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and designs that would have need to
be usher'd in and supported with new Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
nor of the wickedness of those men that
holp the Devil to invent them; nor of the gross
ignorance of an after-age, that fitted the people
to receive 'em. All which things, had they
not conspired together, it had been Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for such monstrous Absurdities to be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61309:16"/>
imposed upon the Faith of so great a part of
Mankind.</p>
            <p>How could those strange Fictions of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
have ever obtain'd; if men had not
been fool'd into the belief of them, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Visions, and Revelations, and Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Who could ever have been so Sottish,
as to adore the works of the Pencil, and the
Chizzle; unless the dumb things themselves
had been made to move, and sweat, and talk,
and weep for it? What Believer of the true
God would ever have stoopt to the Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his fellow-creatures? nay to invocate them
more then God, (for God is not so often pray'd
to, as the Virgin <hi>Mary)</hi> but that these blessed
Creatures themselves, as well as their deluded
worshippers, have been abused intolerably by the
forgers of Miracles? I shall instance but in one
Doctrine more; I might do it in many, for
there is hardly any one of their upstart Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
which has not been taught or promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this way; but this is the transcendent foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of all, the Doctrine of Transubstantiation.
A Miracle it self they call it, in their Manual,
which teaches them to say thus at the Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>Oh Miracle! Oh the Goodness</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is
done by no Iugling, but in the open sight of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61309:16"/>
all the lookers on.</hi> And what do the Lookers on
Discern? Do they see any visible change of
the Elements? no, not the least shadow of
alteration: But what is it that they believe?
a Miracle? Nay, more than a Miracle, flat Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
and Contradiction. A subject to be
without accidents, and accidents without any
subject. They believe the same body to be at
the same time in so many several places, and
whole in every place; in Heaven, upon Earth,
both here, and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in both the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
Oh monstrous belief! had not this need
to be supported with Miracles? It was propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
by them, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">de Sacram. Eucharistiae, l. 3. c. 8.</note> proves it by
them, because some have seen the Host to bleed,
others have seen a Child in the place of it; and
he tells us, that St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi>'s horse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
his Oats to go and worship it.</p>
            <p>I am sensible that these things are very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
and therefore I am ashamed to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any more of them. And yet, I hope, you
will excuse us, if we mention in our Sermons
such things as have been the chief Arguments
of theirs; and such Arguments as their great
Masters of Controversie despair not, that some
may possibly be fools enough to believe them.
But if I should proceed into their Legends
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61309:17"/>
and Lives; if I should spread before you the
filth of those lewd Romances; I should seem
to have too little regard to this Place, and to
this Presence. They are stuft with such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
Tales, such idle and extravagant Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies:
as if the Devil had invented them in a
wanton humour; being not content to have
affronted the true Miracles of God, and to
have had his Will upon the Doctrine of Christ;
but he must insult also, and sport himself with
the Ignorance and Superstition of Men.</p>
            <p>I cannot think of these things without some
wonder at those men, who, knowing that
these things are written in their own Books,
and that some of us are able to Read them,
can yet be so impudent as to revile and
scoffe at the Reformation. That happy Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of Christian Religion! without which,
their old Tales would have been Gospel still;
and the Cheat would have proceeded farther
still, and 'tis hard to imagine what a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
by this time, Christianity would have
grown. I know some of them say, that they
themselves are the better for it, which yet may
be a very great Question. For though the
Crafts-men among them are grown more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of late daies, in shewing of their Tricks,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61309:17"/>
and the Writers of them bring their Matters
more within compass than their Predecessors
did: yet they can never wipe off the shame of
their Old doings, while they read Lessons in
their Churches collected out of those Legends;
and while they Retain those Doctrines, (nay
they make them part of their Creed,) that
owe, some their Being, and all their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
to those gross and palpable Impostures.
For us, we have great cause to bless God for
the Reformation; which, like Christianity
when it first appear'd in the world, has chased
away these Demons and their Oracles from
among us. I do not hear they work any
Miracles among us of late daies; unless this
be a Miracle, which I think is no Wonder,
that some persons, for some causes, are won over
to so corrupt a Religion. For our parts, we
pretend to no new Miracles, nor have any Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
while we content our selves with the
old Doctrines, While we hold to the Prophet
that God has sent us, we may rest in those
Miracles that He wrought for us. God grant
we may be wrought by 'em into a due Faith
and Obedience.</p>
            <p>First, we owe a duty of Faith to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of our Prophet; to all that have been
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61309:18"/>
taught by him and his Apostles, and are left
written for us in the Holy Scriptures. In
which Scriptures, though there be <hi>many things
hard to be understood, which ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
Souls wrest to their own Damnation:</hi> yet
all those things are Plainly deliver'd, which
are Necessary for us to know. Which were
therefore collected by the Apostles into the
<hi>Creed;</hi> and own'd by the Fathers under the
name of the <hi>Apostolical Tradition:</hi> the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of which was necessary for every man, at
his Baptism, to make him a <hi>Christian;</hi> and
was sufficient for any man, that was Baptiz'd,
to be known by as a Member of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Church.</p>
            <p>This is the Tradition, not of one or two,
but of all Ages: This is the Faith, not of this
or that, but of all Churches: as far as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
goes, it is the same Faith and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
still. This has the seal of God to it, in
all the Miracles of Christ, and of his Apostles,
and of the Primitive Christians. Whosoever
Adds to it, or Varies from it, (especially if he
pretend to Miracles, of which the Scripture
has forewarn'd us,) we are bound to defie
both Him and his Doctrines. If we hold our
selves close to this Faith, and if This should
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61309:18"/>
happen to deceive us; what have we to say?
but with St. <hi>Victor,</hi> Oh Lord, it is thou
that hast deceiv'd us; Thou hast given such
plain Demonstrations, such visible Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
of thy Almighty hand to it; that if This
should be false, we know not what can be
true. For there is no possible way of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of things removed from bodily sense, no
way to make any thing surer to our belief; then
that is, by which we are made sure of this, that
this Faith, this Christian Doctrine, was taught
by that Prophet that was sent from God.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we owe the duty of Obedience to
his Precepts, to those Rules of life which he
has given us in the name of God. Rules that,
like their Author, are full of Justice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
then which nothing can be more fitly
contrived, to make us live happily here in This
world, and to prepare us for a Better life in
the world to come. Nor do they provide
only for the Private, but also for the Publick.
They both Direct and Secure every man in his
own proper Station. So that he were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Friend to Himself, nor a Lover of
humane Society, that should not heartily
submit to these Laws; though he were led
to it by no other consideration, but that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61309:19"/>
of their own Goodness and Utility.</p>
            <p>But withall when we consider, from what
hand they come; and by whom, and in what
manner they were sent: how can we acquit
our selves, in the breach of these Laws, of
the highest Ingratitude and Rebellion against
Almighty God? That good God, that has been
pleased to require nothing of us, but such things
as of themselves are truly best for us; and yet, as
if that were not enough to oblige us, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
'em by such a Prophet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
them to us by undeniable Testimonies.
Unless we Obey these Laws, what can we expect
from Him? what Ought we to think of our
selves? If the <hi>Iews,</hi> out of a misunderstanding
of God's Counsel, did oppose and reject it; If
that whole Generation of men were overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with such Calamities, as no other Nation
ever felt, no other Age ever knew; If their whole
Posterity were sent wandring about the World,
to make us fear that great God that has sent these
Examples to our doors: How shall We ever hope
to escape, if we neglect so great a Salvation as is
now offered to us? What Examples may God
make of us in This World? What Judgments
must we look for in the Other? What Penalties,
what measure of Wrath, can be too much for such
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61309:19"/>
ungrateful Wretches, such Rebels against the
Supream Majesty of God?</p>
            <p>I beseech you pardon me this great Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
if any degree of Vehemence can need
pardon, in the pressing of things that so infinitely
concern you. That these things do so, we shall
be more sensible hereafter. It is but a little while;
and He that is now our Prophet, shall come to
be our Judge, and shall call us to a strict Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
before him. Then will the Observation
of his Laws be a Comfort and a Joy: Then
will the Neglect of them cause Horror and
Desperation. 'Twill be a restless Grief to reflect,
how easily we were won to Neglect them; how
easily we might have Observ'd them. We have
yet the Opportunity before us. Good God give
us Hearts to Consider it: Now in this time
of <hi>Advent,</hi> so to remember the First coming of
thy Son, when He came to be our Prophet; that
we may be prepared, and ready for his Second
coming, when He shall come to be our Judge.
<hi>To whom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
